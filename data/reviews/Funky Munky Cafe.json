{"text":"I got the mangoberry iced tea with tapioca! So delicious!!! Great service, cool furnishings....loved the atmosphere. Looking forward to having a movie night here soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Randomly found this place after going for breakfast in the plaza. This cafe has a cool retro/hipster/indie theme going on. Cool beverage options like their 'coftea' which is a mix of steeped coffee and tea drink. They also have your typical cafe drinks and bubble tea! The drinks are decently priced for a decent size! Both the staff that were working were super friendly and explained the menu options. They have a pretty cool clothing line, which they also sell in store. Free wifi and a lot of comfy tables and chairs. It's a good place if you're looking for somewhere to work or study, and also a great place to catch up with a friend over coffee. If you're looking to study/work here and need plugs for your laptop, etc., I didn't see too many outlets on the walls but for sure saw a couple. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"AMAZING atmosphere and playlist. a typical but not so typical drinks menu (ie horlick?! LOVE), and super cute how they bring the community together with themed days/nights"}
{"text":"Amazing cafe. Great vibes, very clean. Staff are very helpful and know the menu well. I ordered a hot jasmine milk tea and sea salt brownie. They were both excellent. My only criticism is I wish the brownie was warmed up. I would defiantly return there though."}
{"text":"A great cafe to study, meet up with friends, or spend some time reading. Free wifi makes that all easily possible!

The menu has a variety of drinks ranging from the comforting tea and coffee favourites to milk and bubble teas. The selection of baked goods is the perfect accompaniment. 

Great service with friendly staff who are happy to help their customers. The overall vibe is mix of industrial and vintage and totally welcoming. You forget that you're in a strip mall."}
{"text":"just a really great atmosphere with unique drinks.  come here all the time for mangberry blacktea.  really good for teens/20 somethings"}
{"text":"Came to check out this new cafe with my husband.  We got the funky munky style milk tea in both hot and cold, 2 cookies and a muffin to share.  

The milk tea is super smooth and delicious in both hot and cold varieties and not too sweet either.  The cookies were super yummy and had a great chew.  The muffin they offered that day was zucchini and walnut which made me feel slightly more healthy because of the hidden veg inside!  The prices were also very reasonable for the amount of food/ drink that you get.  

The cafe has a great vibe and the baristas are super friendly.  Overall, my husband and I loved it and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While waiting for my order at the king' s kitchen, I walked in to Funky Munky Cafe, looking for a caffeine fix. Checked out their menu,  Interesting but small selection of flavoured milk tea drinks. Asked about coffee but was sadly informed that they only have pressed coffee, on the waitresses recommendation I tried the tea/coffee. Tastes as expected, english breakfast with a coffee after taste, nothing to really rave about. This cafe has an Indie/hipster vibe, neat decor and relaxing place to hang out or work.  This may be a bias opinion but they are in need of an espresso machine or at the very least a keurig or a nespresso machine. 

If you are looking for coffee, look elsewhere. If you want bubble tea in a chilled environment then this maybe the place for you.  Two stars for the tea/coffee , plus one star for the friendly staff and relaxing decor."}
{"text":"It's about time Markham got a cafe like this! I went on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't too loud/busy so it's a good little study spot. I just wish they had more plugs!

Try their almond latte! It's delicious. Like some other reviews have said, it reminds me of the Chinese almond soup dessert."}
{"text":"Loved the house special lemon iced black tea, so simple but yet refreshing, you can actually taste the the black tea, perfect mix of the lemon and sweeten tea, not like some places where all you taste is super sweet tea and very little lemon"}
{"text":"Great place to do work. People were friendly and drinks were very reasonably priced. I got a regular coffee-tea concoction for less than $4 and it surely satisfied my caffeine needs. Wish they have a branch downtown. 

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very cool hybrid western hipster cafe slash Hong Kong cafe fusion. On Sunday's they welcome car meets eg. Mitsubishi, KDMO etc. They also have movie nights. Great tasting selection of drinks both reasonably priced  HK style teas and western hand filtered coffees in cold and hot."}
{"text":"Dope spot.  Thank you for fueling my matcha addiction! I'm coming to get a matcha milk tea right now."}
{"text":"Good vibes, atmosphere, and friendly service. Great stop for teas and snacks. Coffee choices are limited however their teas are recommended. I ordered their cold \"FM Classic Tea\" and taste like hk tea with their own twist. Happy to find a place like this in Markham!"}
{"text":"A small place located beside Garden Basket. The staff here are very friendly and helpful!

We had a pychee lemon tea and an iced coffee. The pychee lemon tea is a passion fruit and lychee lemon tea. It was way too strong in flavour, and too sweet for my liking but some people may like it that way. For the iced coffee, it was good. Nothing special, but would order it again. Prices were fair. I would definitely come back to try other drinks"}
{"text":"I came here for a caffeine fix and was pleasant surprised by the delicious iced coffee. Really strong and made just right - but you probably want to down it all before the ice melts or pick it out. If they made viet iced coffee here, I think I'd die.

And the milk teas here are a treat! The Jasmine milk tea had such a wonderful and delicate Jasmine taste, I regret not getting my own (stole some from the bf...). I didn't think jasmine milk tea could really impress as a flavour by itself but I was certainly wrong. 

The almond milk tea on the other hand forgets delicate, and had a really intense flavour that reminded me of those almond soup desserts. 

I didn't love the regular \"classic\" milk teas any more than the milk read I get at Asian places though.  I think it just seems to miss that layer of flavour the top places have, but it's still better than your average cha chan tang. I guess they did only say it's \"like\" the HK-style ones though. :P 

FM is pretty awesome overall. Their friendliness is greatly appreciated too. Next up: splurge on their Horlicks. :O"}
{"text":"Cute little Indie cafe conveniently located near my house! Ideal location to walk to given the nice weather, or there are lots of parking spaces if you intend on driving. Either way, this will probably be my go-to spot for the rest of exam szn. (Free wifi and ample loads of caffeine are key)

The owner & workers are super friendly and make very yummy drinks. I've tried the iced coffee, green apple green tea with lychee jelly, and their spring special - iced cafe mocha. Needless to say, each drink is very flavourful and not too sweet. Thankfully the iced coffee doesn't taste watered down, and always fresh. 

Prices range anywhere from $4 to $6 depending on what you're getting and the size of drinks - but this is expected for a specialty cafe where they offer wifi and plenty of outlets so you can stick around and study or hang out! 

Not to mention they even sell their own merch which is pretty cool! Although I wouldn't necessarily buy it, they're a nice addition to the store and definitely adds to the theme. 

I've yet to try their hot drinks, but I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe to hang out after work or school! They play a lot of great indie music like BØRNS, Mumford and sons, etc. Their drinks are pretty good as well. They serve both hot and cold tea, coffee and bubble tea. I've tried their almond bubble tea with tapioca. It was pretty good. Imagine almond milk but a more intense almond flavouring (like adding almond extract into your drink). I really liked their iced coffee although, there was a lot of ice in the drink which really watered it down. But overall I would highly recommend studying here or just getting coffee! 

They have free wifi and lots of seating!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend and friend for the Subiehood's Cars & Coffee meet. This was our first time coming here. The atmosphere was so welcoming and the baristas were really nice. We took some time to figure out what we wanted from the menu and they were very patient on answering our questions and waiting for us to be ready lol. I ordered a london fog...and I honestly forgot what the other two ordered (whoops). I was a little sad they ran out of almond or soy milk for the night, but got lactose-free instead, which was fine. 

While we were waiting, I was so curious about the apparel they were selling. I have never seen a cafe sell apparel, and I was actually interested in buying one. I was happy with my london fog. It was really good that once I finished mine, I wanted another one! My friend said the same thing about her drink. I would definitely go back for another drink. Plus a lot of people mentioned coming here to study...maybe this will be my go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Funky Munky, is as the name describes, funky. It's a hipster cafe located in the garden basket plaza of North East markham. It has, hands down, the coolest decor of any store in the cookie cutter plaza. Transformers art, comic book prints, abstract photos, etc adorn the walls, allowing this little cafe to make a strong first impression.  The cafe serves an asian fusion of popular HK style beverages. Their Funky Munky HK milk tea has the strong lasting flavor of traditional milk tea, with the unique texture of steamed milk found in espressos.  At only $3, I found the price to be reasonable; more expensive than a traditional HK milk tea that you'd find in a cheap asian diner, but far less than what'd you pay for a \"specialty drink\" at Starbucks.  If you're in markham and looking for a cafe to chill at that's uniquely different, check it out. I don't know if I'm going bananas over it yet, but I'll definitely be going back ."}
{"text":"Great little indie cafe in the Garden Basket plaza at the NE corner of Markham Rd & 16th. Excellent service, awesome almond croissant and the cafe au lait was a bit too sweet but very decent.  Clean, cozy and quiet."}
{"text":"Been there once, ordered bubble tea. It was amazing! The environment there is also really friendly. Love it. Would come again any day."}
{"text":"Love the coftea here and the staff here are friendly. I tried two of their cookies I find them a bit too sweet but still delicious! Banana bread was really good. It's too bad they are located in a boring plaza and opened at noon, as I love drinking Asian tea in the morning!

Feels like a toronto queen street hippy coffee joint/cafe moved to Markham! We need more of these and bring life to Markham! They also sell cute shirts and caps there but not my type of wear.

I love their discount days. Fridays you get 10% off coftea. I wish they had more food options."}
{"text":"Whoa. Can I tell you about this time I found a miracle productivity drug in the form of a caffeinated beverage... I was at this place that has all the cool of a downtown/urban coffee shop but nestled nicely at the end of Markham Main Street. I walked in and realised it was totally my kinda jam! As soon as I saw swag clothing items, Optimus Prime and the rest of the transformers on skateboards, and artisanally brewed coffee and Hong Kong Style tea fused together I was sold!

I was here for a quick visit and asked for them to make me something special that was a fan favourite and without hesitation they recco's they're signature Coff-Tea, which, as I mentioned is the fusion of a Hong Kong Style milk tea and freshly brewed coffee. They warned that this thing packed a punch from the double hit of caffeine and WHOOOOOOOOOO were they right. 

I. WAS. LIT.... AF. I swear I had the most productive afternoon in history that day and if I turned my head, I swear I could see sounds. Real talk!

It's a great place to come chill, and when I come back I'm definitely grabbing some of their branded gear to represent and get me another fix of that sweet cofftea!

Also, unlike spots like Starbucks or super pretentious coffee joints, the beverages here are WAY affordable... almost like they want you to buy 2 or 10!

{"text":"Great little stylish cafe in Markham. Ovaltine was a bit more expensive then HK style cafes but totally worth it since it was the best Ovaltine l've ever had."}
{"text":"Cool new cafe with great drinks  (I had the iced coffee on a 35 degree day) and it totally hit the spot.  Very cozy atmosphere with a retro/modern look.  Coffee was fresh pressed and service was fast and friendly!  I'm tired of overpriced drip coffee from franchises,  Funky Munk Cafe is the place to be."}
{"text":"Really nice cafe in Markham! Good wifi, mix of coffee and bubble teas and good playlists in the bg if you're there to work. Looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"I used the cafe to get my caffeine fix while doing some work the past week and absolutely enjoyed it. 

The drinks were wonderful, all of the staff were polite and welcoming, even the other customers were respectful towards each other (no loud, obnoxious conversations). 

I will definitely be returning this week! 

Definitely try out the carrot loaf, it's a winner! The prices are comparable to Starbucks, not as much variety but I prefer funky's pressed coffee!"}
{"text":"One cup of coffee here had me shaking like a sad squirrel in the dead of winter. I have not slept since drinking this

What I'm saying is, this some good stuff...:d 

Great study space with lot of plugs and self serve water. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"It is a small local coffee shop in my neighbourhood .  In my opinion,  their coffee quality taste ok and was nothing outstanding and special for a return. 
Price was a little bit high. 
A good place to hang out but don't expect  superb quality."}
{"text":"It's got an awesome vibe. I love doing my marking there. There's enough outlets and their milk tea is bomb! Super potent stuff if you need to be focused for awhile."}
{"text":"Funky Munky Cafe is located in Markham Plaza on Markham Road and north of 16th ave.
It is quite spacious with a good amount of table space. The cafe decor gives off a retro/hipster feel to it. 

It is an Asian fusion cafe, offering coffee and bubble tea! We ordered their house special milk tea and their mangberry drink. They had a special for their mangberry drink for 30% off. Both drinks were yummy, having prominent flavours and not being too sweet. They also have baked goods and snacks if you're looking for something small to snack on.

We stayed for a few hours in the afternoon and before we decided to leave (around 7PM), I noticed they had a projector screen. It looks like in the evenings they play movies and the night we went they were going to play Harry Potter! 

Overall, this is a great cafe to stop by. It is spacious which makes a great study spot if you're looking for somewhere new that serves bubble tea. The cafe have fast wifi and friendly baristas. I'll make sure to come back to try their other drinks and stay for their movie nights!"}
{"text":"Funky Munky Cafe is a little quaint yet modern cafe situated on Markham Road north of 16th Avenue.  It's located in a strip mall where there is also a Garden Basket and Cora's.  The cafe may be hard to find but after you have turned into the parking lot, you'll be able to spot its modern and trendy storefront for sure.

Funky Munky Cafe keeps to the basics.  They only sell hot and cold drinks and a handful of baked goods.  That's all!  Their simple menu makes it easy for customers to come in for a drink or small bite to eat while enjoying a chat with a friend or two or even for studying purposes.  They have free wifi.  Some of their baked goods include brownies, croissants, scones, and cookies."}
{"text":"Great find!!!! I am super thrilled with the vibe in this place as well as the quality. Calm, quiet and cool, this place is warm with it's wood tables and cafe bar, with some funky retro wall decor. I love the comic book picture s and the funky tanks and shirts they sell. The coffee and tea selection looks phenomenal, I had a black pressed coffee which is great quality. I would suggest having some dairy and soy free milk options, like almond, rice or coconut milk, because I love have loved to try some of the other drinks. The barista was also really friendly, great customer service! I will be back again! Forever a vibe seeker"}
{"text":"Third time coming here today. The drinks are good but what sets this place apart is the spacious, clean atmosphere and decor. It's a great place to get work done, chill, go on a date, etc - there aren't many cafes like this in Markham.

One thing I would like to see added to the menu are savoury snacks. I ordered the Taro Milk Tea and was looking for something savoury to snack on, but there wasn't anything offered. I had to settle with an oatmeal raisin cookie and almost got diabetes. 

I know this isn't Green Grotto, but if they could add popcorn/popcorn chicken that would be bomb. You can't be offering Taiwanese drinks without the snacks - that's like giving someone a bottle of beer without the bottle opener. Or perhaps they could add something healthy-I asked the barista which of their offerings was the healthiest and was met with silence.

Another bonus is that they have a good playlist, so kudos to their playlist-maker."}
{"text":"It was love at first sip. 
This place is gets 5 stars in all aspects. The size, quality and price are all better then Markham bubble tea's major competitor. This place offers unique and customizable flavours and the employees were super patient and helped me decide as a first timer. 

I got a green tea \"pango\" bubble tea with lychee jelly and my boyfriend got a sesame milk tea with tapioca and both are so delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A little gem hidden away in the corner of the Garden Basket plaza.

I was in the area looking for a good place to study since all the libraries were full and had less than stellar wifi. Found this place on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised as soon as I walked in. The aesthetic of the place is really nice and the staff was very friendly and personable as soon as I came in. Of the people that were inside, most of them were doing some kind of work which I took as a good sign.

The wifi connection was solid, and I was much more productive here than I've been in a while. The music playing wasn't too loud, and wasn't the usual top 40 radio. I ordered the house special FM Style Tea. It was a little bit bland for me, but was perfect with a little bit of sugar. I will definitely come again and would recommend this to anyone looking for a change from their usual study locations."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice and quiet cafe with quality lattes, tea, coffee and bubble tea options. Saw quite a few people bringing their laptops to work here, others bringing board games to play, yet others just sitting and chatting. My friend and I sat there for 3 hours and never felt any pressure to leave (it was not busy). 

Friendly staff, clean washroom, really nothing to complain about. Will be back!!! I can't believe it's open for 1.5 years and I just found out this place today :)"}
{"text":"Funky Munky Cafe is probably one of my favorite places in Markham east end when I need a legit milk tea! 

Decor is awesome here, very hipster-ish and I love how they have 90s cartoon arts on the wall. This place is perfect if you want to hang out with a small group of friends and enjoy some legit HK style milk tea or cofftea (Half milk tea, half coffee).  Both drinks were awesome and they are so HK style, which is perfect for me because I really hate some of the chain bbtea stores sometimes as the taste is inconsistent across the different stores.  This place you know you are getting a perfect drink!  For the price you pay, it's so worth it compared to your regular bbtea places.

Last time I came here, they had a live band going and after speaking with the owner, the singer works at the cafe too.  What a beautiful voice and amazing performance.  I believe they will do live band night here and there and I can't wait until the next one!"}
{"text":"Upon seeing the reviews of Funky Munky Cafe we just had to try this truly unique place.
Aside from the owners old classic Chevy truck parked out front, Funky Munky's ambiance gives it a urban, rustic, yet classic feel, with skateboard artistry, city-scape pictures, colorful bar stools, old comic pictures, rustic lighting, wooden tables and chairs Funky Monkey is full of surprises.
What makes it unique?

*They do pressed coffee and tea, and at times mix the two if you're needing a kick of caffeine, and they're quite good at putting a spin on a few classic hot and cold drinks (including Bubble tea)

Being a bit bold at this part of the night I tried their Cofftea...mix of their high caffeinated tea and coffee....wow was it rich, robust and strong.  

Their prices are quite reasonable for the quality and labor of love they put into creating your drink."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given a bubble tea place 5 stars before.

To be honest, I came here to meet up with a friend not expecting much.  Except I walked into a quaint modern indie cafe that is up at Markham and 16th with a great atmosphere and a rocking FM Style hong kong style milk tea.  

The decor is awesome, the vibe is great, prices are good and their drinks really hit the spot.  They make good bubble tea AND good coffee.  Usually no bubble tea places do that. 

I had their chocolate banana bread which was REALLY good, their brownie was great too, their nutella cookie is okay (but then to their credit....no Nutella cookie has wowed me as of yet).  

They also have cool merchandise for sale that I want to own all of, and they have Monday night movie nights, they are starting game night soon... 

I'm heavily impressed, and so you get my 5 stars....and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new places to study & I thought this place was great for that. A lot of other people study here too so you don't really feel any pressure to leave. I got one of their bubble tea's, I believe it was passionfruit green-tea and I enjoyed it. The place itself is really cute as well, but it was pretty busy when I went so I'd say try to go earlier if you want a seat. Didn't try any of their baked goods, but I would definitely come back here to study!"}
{"text":"Nice staff and pretty good coffee. Selection  is a be limited but very comfortable environment if you like a cup of coffee with friends."}
{"text":"Great little indie coffee shop located off of Markham Road and 16th. Customer service is excellent. Bubble teas are great as well. Had a slice of the banana loaf and it wasn't too sweet and the texture was spot on. 

They've put a lot of thought into the decorations and service. A nice warm welcome when you walk in and a thank you when you leave. 

The place is super clean and free wifi is available. Great for a first date or a business meeting. 

I'll definitely be going back for some brainstorming business sessions when I need a great environment to thrive in."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between rating this place a 3 or 4 (yelp needs half stars!) because the atmosphere is really nice, with friendly workers and cool decorations but the drinks are pretty average to me and that's obviously a very significant part of a cafe lol. I had a mango green tea cold and a brownie. The brownie was so yummy but I couldn't finish it because it was too sweet. The tea was pretty good. My friend had bubble tea and she said it wasn't bad but she wouldn't pay for it again because it's a little over priced. I was expecting more variety in their drinks, or some sort of original idea but they had a few variations of bubble tea and your typical cafe drinks (hot choco, latte) and that's all."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that this location is perfect for me at least since it is really close to home. Secondly, the ambiance in this cafe is quite relaxing, as I first entered this location, they already had customers sitting on different tables minding their own business and enjoying their drink, seems to be a good place to catch up with a friend or even to do homework with. It seems like they sell their own clothing as I saw some pullover, shirt and hat by the back wall on display. The drink that I ordered was the bubble milk tea in mango flavour, I really enjoy this particular mango drink because it taste different, it reminds me of the ice cream of mango by the brand melona I believe it's called. Usually, any drink that I order I take forever to finish either I get bored of it or something, however, the taste of this one, every sip was like a blessing lol. Try it yourself and you'll see what I mean :)"}
{"text":"This review is about coffee ordering only.  No food.  Overall 3.5 star

We ordered two different types of coffee.  If I take away the decor and ambience, and rate the Funky Munky on the coffee alone, it is a 3-star coffee for this price point.  The coffee was decent, but I have had richer, smoother coffee at similar prices for sure.  But taking away the decor is grossly unfair.  Heck, they name the cafe after the decor!  So put the points for the funky decor back in, the rating is 3.5 stars.

BTW, bubble teas are available here.  Kinda a refreshing east (bubble tea) + west (decent coffee) set up in GTA.  This place likely attracts a younger crowd, with its funky vibe and bubble teas."}
{"text":"This is my favourite beverage place, drinks and food aren't too expensive but taste very good. The staff and owner are all extremely friendly . The place is furnished beautifully and uniquely. Not to mention their MERCH is also very nice!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this cafe! I come here quite often for a caffeine boost and to get some work done.  This cafe is hipster/modern, spacious and a nice, clean spot to hang out. They also play some great music, including coffee shop jazz and some throwback music. I usually just have the regular drip coffee, which tastes great as it is freshly roasted and ground in house. Their \"coftea\" (combo of steeped tea and coffee with evaporated milk) is my drink of choice when I need to get some work done because it has got an incredible boost of caffeine! I haven't tried their other drinks yet, but look forward to trying their bbt soon. They've also got a variety of delicious goods including jumbo cookies. Service is always great, their staff is incredibly friendly! Definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Nice coffee, nice vibe. Baked goods are decent. Staff are super friendly. A welcome addition to Markham. Sometimes it can be hard to get a table, but usually a spot opens up. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have tried their FM style tea (hot) and iced FM coftea.  Both drinks were absolutely delicious and are reminiscent of HK style tea and mixed coffee/tea respectively, but with less sugar (which is how I prefer it). The black tea they use is excellent and they make it real strong.  

Customer service was great as the staff members are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable about their products.  

I'm glad this cafe has opened here in Markham and look forward to trying more of their menu.  I highly recommend you pop in and try out their drinks. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This cafe is hidden in the plaza with Garden Basket. Upon entering, I was greeted by 2 very friendly ladies behind the counter. They asked if I had been there before and explained their menu since it was my first time there. 

I ordered the FM iced tea and an almond croissant. The tea was slightly different compared to how it would be regularly prepared as I needed it lactose free, so I'm not sure how it would have tasted otherwise. I was thoroughly pleased with the taste of the iced tea. It is exactly how I would want my iced tea. Coming from an Indian background, we drink our tea VERY strong. Like, stronger than coffee, strong. It was the same strength as what I'm used to drinking. The flavour of the tea was absolutely perfect. I forgot to ask for less sugar, as I usually find drinks extremely sweet, but even then it was sweetened perfectly. The almond croissant was delicious as well. I only wish it was toasted a bit so it could have that crispy outside while being warm and soft on the inside with the gooey almond filling. 

There is quite a bit of seating available inside. There was even a large table that would be suitable for larger groups. They also have free wifi. 

I will definitely be back to this cafe whenever I can. I only wish I lived closer, but that may be best for my wallet! 

Excellent service, delicious food and drinks, and a really cute interior with a comic book theme."}
{"text":"Enjoyed trying this little place. Very hip decor, friendly staff and just a good vibe.

Tried the french vanilla and it was pretty good. I think next time I'd ask for it to be half sweet. Also tried the almond croissant but it had this weird paste inside which I wasn't a big fan of. The chocolate chip orea pb cookie was really sweet so if you have a sweet tooth, go for it! My sister tried the coffee tea mix (or something) and she thought it was good, tasted mostly like tea. Everything cost about $14. 

Cute little date :)"}
{"text":"Great service. Nice owner. Nice atmosphere. Enjoyable drinks. Enjoy supporting a small business such as this!"}
{"text":"Came in for a couple quick drinks. Really cool atmosphere. 

Not too impressed with my decaf coffee. I love my coffee, but wanted to drink some late at night. I had no choice but to get decaf. They proceeded to pull out a can of what looked to be presidents choice coffee. It tasted like cardboard. Now, I know its decaf so I was kind of in the wrong too but please get a better coffee!! 

My girlfriend got some sort of citrus tea. It was pretty strong and pretty tart but she really liked it. 

Ill have to try out the different drinks, but until then, its benefit of the doubt. 4 stars"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located at the plaza with Dollarama, Pizza Pizza, Cora's etc. on Markham Rd. and 16th Ave. Parking is usually never an issue. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff were very friendly, and made drink recommendations based on my preferences e.g. hot or cold? Caffeinated or decaf? Sweet or unsweetened?

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Cozy, retro, and small coffee shop vibes. Great place for studying, relaxing by yourself, or catching up with friends. This place also had their merch on display, so can you physically browse and feel the quality of their items. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
Very aromatic, smooth, and high-quality coffee and tea. 

[ORDER]
FM Coftea (Hot) - $3.30: a perfect blend of coffee and tea. This drink was so silky and had the perfect amount of caffeine if you are looking for a more subtle energy spike.

Honestly, this place serves the best Coftea in the area. I would definitely recommend this café for the wonderful ambiance and amazing drinks! Cheers."}
{"text":"Funky Munky is located inconspicuously in a inconspicuous lot in a inconspicuous location.
It is my favourite café to study in with strong wifi and a extensive caffeinated menu that includes childhood drinks like horlick and bubble tea. 
Tip: get the brownie and horlick.

Prices aren't too bad especially when it's usually not very crowded and nobody shoos you out.  
They have their own merchandise which is pretty cute and I have one of their tanks which I love.

The place is always clean and the service excellent.

Tip 2: BOGO half off from 11AM-1PM"}
{"text":"Awesome service. The owner himself is very pleasant and so are all of the staff members! I used to work a few doors down and would go there at break for drink. 

I loved the new lemon iced drink they had, it was my favourite! Also loved the warm teas.

The ambiance makes you want to stay there all day. A great study spot or for anyone that just wants a spot to get work done. 

Overall an amazing cafe!"}
{"text":"This place has its bittersweet charm, and has begun to grow on me. From its trendy decor, to indie and throw back music. It's definitely an upcoming hangout spot. They have plenty of outlets for studying, but only one large table, so group study is a no-go.

I haven't tried the desserts, but I can say their coffee is decent. 

The staff are very welcoming and friendly, and that's what customer service is all about. They greet you when you walk in, and thank you when you leave. Have never been disappointed on their service.

The only let down for me would be their bubble tea. The pearls are chewy the way I like them, but still feel a bit chalky and undercooked in the centre. And it seems that no matter what I get, their BBTs always tastes diluted. I love that they default using less sugar, but it's still lacking in tea flavour.

Stellar service, charming atmosphere, but bubble tea needs some work. Fixing that would make this place a 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time coming here, a friend heard about Funky Munky  and wanted to try it out. 

I ordered the pressed coffee. I'm no coffee expert, probably far from it, but I know there's a lot of coffees I don't like, and this was not one of them. Everyone has a different preference on coffee so it's hard to say exactly whether it's good or bad, but for my tastes in particular, I liked it. It wasn't overly bitter, it didn't have a sour after taste, it had a strong flavor even after adding cream and sugar. Not to mention solid lids, I can't begin to express how important small subtle features like this make a difference.

Service was great. Very friendly, informative and also attentive. My car kinda stands out, being bright yellow, and as a result, I was informed about weekly car meets on Sunday evenings. You'll notice from other reviews here that they have different activities on certain nights as well. 

There are a few baked goods you can choose from, but unfortunately, if you're hungry, you may want to grab a bite before coming by to hang out. I think this is something that can bring Funky Munky to the next level. Even if there isn't a full kitchen, maybe have a small little deli station. That way people can get sandwiches, even if not for a meal, for a snack.

So far so good though. Keep it up."}
{"text":"It calls itself the indie cafe of markham and while I've heard this term being used quite often, I wanted to look it up to be sure. Indie is defined as \"not belonging to or affiliated with a major company.\" Is this a cafe? Yes. Is this an indie cafe? Also yes.

Cleanliness: Tables were wiped and the interior decor is very old school feel but very interesting. You'd have to see it for yourself! 

Management: You get greeted once you walk towards the cash and they are very helpful in explaining the menu items if you're unfamiliar with the term \"coftea.\" The menu is easy to follow and while it's not extensive, it helps if you can't make decisions. I wish they would indicate somewhere that they have lactose-free milk even if they don't have dairy alternatives.

Service: They are very friendly and knowledgeable. I bought one of the 90Five tanks for women and I usually wear XS and the girl was super helpful in telling me it runs small (it was true) so I got the small and it's perfect! I usually get take-out so I'm not sure what their table service is like, but it seems like you grab your drink and find a seat yourself. 

I had the following items: 

1. Iced Cafe Mocha (Reg size is $4.00):
They already have some sugar mixed into their mocha mix so it's a bit sweet for me but I still really enjoyed it because it was a good mix of chocolate and espresso. I got it with the lactose-free milk with no extra charge. Something that makes this cafe stand apart is how they make the iced drinks. While other cafes might put the ice and mix it in the shaker with the drink and then serve it to you, I noticed that Funky Munky puts a new set of ice cubes in your drink instead of using the same ice it was shaken with. This is actually brilliant because it makes the drink colder since it wasn't shaken with the hot drink. I really appreciated that - not sure how good this is for water conservation though :/

2. Banana Loaf ($1.50-2.00 [I can't remember]):
It smelled delicious and was very soft! I'm not a fan of bananas on their own so I liked that there wasn't a super strong banana taste when I enjoyed it.

Overall, a nice cafe for studying or chatting with a friend or two. I would definitely need to go back to try their flagship coftea, but it lives up to its claim of being an indie cafe with their unconventional drinks and store hours (open and closes late)."}
{"text":"Second time trying this cafe and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was very relaxing and \"funky\". I got a medium matcha milk tea with tapioca which was customized by an amazing barista named Marcella. She was so polite, considerate and exhibited excellent customer service. I will definitely come back again. 

The matcha milk tea with tapioca was not too sweet and not too creamy which was perfect for me. What was really great was that they make the tapioca everyday. Price was not too bad compared to the other bubble tea places around Markham."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe in Markham. Staff is so friendly, and I love the aesthetic of the place - great for Instagram pictures haha.

It's a really good place to do your work. Came here with two of my friends, and we actually got a lot of things done. The drinks were also good, and they also offer some desserts to snack on, but wish they had some sandwiches or other foods to eat."}
{"text":"By the name, you would never guess that this is a cafe.  And when you make the trip to visit Funky Munky, don't assume that it's just a normal coffee shop.  It totally isn't.  I made the mistake of telling my husband to put in my order for a latte while I setup my notebook to do some catch up blogging.  The owner of Funky Munky, who was behind the counter, called me over and explained their menu to us.  Funky Munky's drink options are I guess what you can call more Asian based.  They do offer coffee, but they also do bubble teas, and milk teas.  In the end I ordered a tea latte.  Funky Munky has their own special blend of black tea as the base of the tea latte, and then they add frothed milk to give it a latte like feeling.  The tea was really good, fragrant, and strong.  It tastes like a Hong Kong styled milk tea, but lighter because of the frothed milk instead of using normal dense evaporated milk."}
{"text":"Good Bye Funky Munky Cafe!

It was such a privilege that you were in my neighbourhood though it was just for a short 2 years.

You were just so different and so Funky compares to all the other franchise coffee shops in the immediate area. I could see that all the students from the nearby High School loves all your drinks and always have a good time!

Good luck with your future venture! And I hope to spot your Funky pick up truck again somewhere soon."}
{"text":"By far my favourite bubble tea spot in Markham. Great place to pick up a drink, chat with friends, or study for exams. The staff is always very friendly and the drinks are always amazing. My personal favourite is the strawchee black tea with tapioca (usually opt for less ice and 50% sugar). 

The vibe and atmosphere in the café is something that you cannot find in many other places in Markham. Would definitely recommend trying it at least once."}
{"text":"Has a great homey feel, very welcoming. The drinks are bomb, they're great. The customer service is wonderful, and the environment in general is awesome."}
{"text":"Here for coffee take out but friendly staff suggested the FM style tea. It was delicious and caffeinated enough to wake me up. Seems like a great place to sutdy, will definitely be back!"}
