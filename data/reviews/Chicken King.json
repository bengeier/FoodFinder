{"text":"I love coming to this particular chicken king because the front counter girls are great. I enjoy their service more than their food. that being said, the foods not bad either. just simple home style cooking. nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Southern comfort food at its best! Hush puppies to die for! Food is delicious, cashiers are very friendly, food is always made very quickly. We've tried most things on the menu, all have been perfectly fried and very flavorful. Tip: if you get the fish sandwich to go, get sauce on the side because it will get soggy."}
{"text":"Nice, very nice. Their grilled chicken sandwich is awesome. Tender, juicy and flauvorful.  I had it with a side of potato salad. I also had a plate of shrimp, chicken, fries, hush puppies and coleslaw. Shrimp is deep fried and I think is breaded.  Everything is fresh and delicious.Place is clean, food is tasty, they don't ask you for refills, but I didn't expect it and they met my expectations. i left the place fat and happy and it's a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the other food, but probably one of the best steak and cheese subs that I can say I have had in years. Fries need need to be a little crisper though. And like may have said that is looks sketchy when driving by, but it's worth the trip. 5 minutes from our house and it's our new go to for a quick meal."}
{"text":"went to this place while on business in the area a couple times for carryout. Fried chicken was great. A bit of a wait, but that is because they cook it up fresh when ordered. Decent prices too."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place. They offer fast food meals with A+ ingredients that's delicious and quick. My intentions was to pick up a takeout order for someone else and ended up with a tasty fish filet sandwich for myself. The menu is stacked with various entrees from burgers, seafood, chicken, desserts and kid's meals. Don't expect healthy (they do serve a variety of salads), just deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"Friendly, courteous staff. Clean facilities.  Broad menu. Good food, especially the homemade onion rings. I will eat here again when in the area."}
{"text":"This is very close to my office and seemed busy so I stopped by to order lunch to go. I got the 1/2 Fried Chicken with fries and slaw and the portion was gigantic. I generally prefer skinless fried chicken, especially when I fry it myself, but I thought the flavor of their chicken was overall very good and the skin was not overly absorbent of the seasonings; a la corporate chains. They also offer salads and individual sides. The value was also excellent in relation to the portions. I will definitely go back for the fried chicken and fish plates, but the service needs improvement. Most of the runners and order takers are teenage girls and for some reason they enjoy giving me a hard time (phrasing) [double entendre]. But it's basically a diner so it is what it is."}
{"text":"First of all, I could walk to the Chicken King from my house if I wanted, but it's right on the edge of the sketchy part of Plaza-Midwood, so I've driven by it for three years without giving it the time of day. But recently my curiosity took over and I ventured inside.   Long story short, it's good, southern comfort food for cheap. So far I've tried their fish sandwich combo, calabash shrimp platter, buffalo chicken sandwich, and burger. I've loved everything so far, but I'm a HUGE fan of the seafood. It's deliciously fried and $8 will get you a tray big enough to share and still have leftovers. Not to mention their hush-puppies are sweet just like I like them.  I would suggest calling in your order, which is what most customers do (there is no seating inside). Also, they have seasoning at the cash register that I highly recommend you shake all over your fries."}
{"text":"The location is a little sketch, and it's easy to overlook. Once inside, the specials and daily deals line the wall.  The menu is pretty diverse. Chicken ... Seafood... Gyro. The cashier was helpful and cheerful. Food is made to the order, so call ahead or expect a 15-20 minute wait if you show up to take out.   I ordered the 4 piece chicken dinner. The seasoning was very good, the fries were great ... But the Mac and cheese was like velveeta style. I'll be trying other sides the next time. Overall I was impressed with my experience at Chicken King, especially after having been let down by the flavorless chicken at Price's Chicken Coop.   I'll be visiting CK again soon to try the seafood !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place today for lunch.  I had the 2 piece chicken with corn and green beans.  My husband had the catfish plate with fries and slaw.  It was so good!  My chicken was cooked and seasoned just right!  The sides were tasty and a great compliment to the meat.  My husband loved his as well.  He had to bring some home there was so much food.  I just want to add that the ladies working the front of house......were AWESOME!  They were so nice....made us feel right at home.  They laughed with us and made it a fun lunch.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally went here!!  I work part time at Dover Saddlery right in front of them.  My boss goes there all time and said it was great.  And she wasn't lying!!!  They have so much stuff to chose from that I like that I didn't know where to begin.  I have had several of their salads and the King House salad is full of yummy stuff!!  Also have had some of the sides,  The fried okra is on point.  And the vegetable soup is full of lots of goodness.  The service is great also!  I love walking over and talking to the girl that works the counter.  So if you get the chance make sure you stop by and grab some great food with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great prices. Friendly service. Awesome portions. If you like fried chicken, you have got to try this place. Very, very, satisfied customer. Would absolutely visit again."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken finger platter.  That's what I wanted but they have a large variety on their menu.  Very nice staff.  I did take out.  Took 15m. This place is tough to see from the road.  L shaped strip mall with a lot of open buildings."}
{"text":"Quick service serving hot fresh food. I had the chicken philly, onion rings and tea. Gt his is a great value and large quantity of food was served."}
{"text":"Regular customer, got order completely wrong left off wings. Since everybody that works there except for that night knows me and my kids, thought that next time I ordered would be taken care of since I am a known regular. They did nothing to keep a person that orders once or twice a week. Owner would not talk hid behind counter girl! Service is service no matter what area you serve!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food. Also it is extremely affordable and just like the title they're the king of chicken. Want some wings? Want some tenders? Want some good local comfort food? Chicken king is definitely a good choice. A hidden gem and a good place to go to."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've ever had. Small place. Good service. I recommend the gyro. The lamb meat is superb"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to grab take out. Kinda reminds me of a Showmars or South 21 type of place, with a very similar style of menu. Of course their chicken is great, but I've not really found anything on their menu I didn't enjoy. I've had the fried chicken,  tenders, wings, burgers, chops, fish, shrimp, and more. It's all delicious. The fries are fine, but the rings are up there with anyone's for me. The grilled chicken is awesome as well, if you're wanting to cut back on the fried stuff.  The staff is friendly too, even when you walk in five minutes before close. If you stop in regularly, they not only remember you, but what you like to order as well. My only suggestion is to skip the drive through and walk in. They prepare everything to order, so you'll be sitting at the window just as long as you will inside. That's not a bad thing by any means, though.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem I didn't know existed.  The flounder was thick & meaty, the portions were large and the prices were very reasonable.  The onion rings were fresh (not frozen), collards, mac n' cheese, and tarter sauce met my approval.  Staff was friendly so I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. Pretty hard to screw up chicken but they did a pretty well so I don't think I'll ever go back not sure parking pretty below average"}
{"text":"I come here almost every day for lunch, as I work nearby.  The staff is truly among the friendliest that I have ever encountered.  They are always smiling, welcoming, and just genuinely friendly people.  I usually order the Grilled Chicken Salad, and let me tell you how wonderful this salad is.  The chicken I eat first, and by itself with nothing else, because the chicken is that tasty.  It is juicy and grilled to perfection.  They also have tomatoes that are good (never old ones) and cucumber slices on the salad.  The lettuce is also good, as I have had this more than 15 times and never a bad piece of lettuce.  I keep telling myself I want to try their other food, but every time I end up getting this salad because it is so good.  If you drive by this place looking for food, you have made a terrible mistake.  Chicken King is now my lunch place of choice.  Shoot, the food was so good that at quitting time sometimes I go the opposite way from home, in Charlotte traffic, to pick up dinner for the family."}
{"text":"Got take out while staying at a hotel nearby and everything was amazing. Fried shrimp, fried oysters and fried chicken were totally on point. Light and crispy. Not at all greasy. Also had the hush puppies which, as a northerner, I look forward to all year long and they did not disappoint. Only wish they'd been served with some pecan butter !  Had mac and cheese as a side and that was also great. Full of flavor, perfect texture. Staff was friendly. It did take a while for the order to come out -- despite the place being almost empty -- but overall worth the wait.  (Plus it was my husband waiting while I had wine at the hotel so yeah, that'll work!)"}
{"text":"Worst chicken ever. Prices very high chicken servings very small. Flavor was disgusting. Paid five dollars and only got two tiny prices of chicken. My grocery store makes better chicken. Have brushed and flossed and can't get dirty over cooked grease taste out of my mouth. Service is also very rude."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!! I can't believe that I have lived here for 8 years and have never been here! Finally went in last week and I am absolutely going to be a regular customer!!  I ordered the 4 piece chicken dinner (mixed light and dark) with fries and Cole slaw. My son ordered the Philly Cheesesteak w/ fries. We also added a bowl of chicken and dumplings. ALL were OUTSTANDING!!! We also ordered the strawberry cheesecake and banana pudding. My son declared that it was the \"best\" cheesecake he ever had!  I had the banana pudding and it was VERY good.  The service was friendly and helpful. This was our first visit and the menu is quite extensive!  We are excited to find a local establishment with such good food. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger!  Salad was damn good too. Enough for two meals. Looking forward to trying the chicken"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my seafood platter this past Saturday late afternoon. It looked and smelled wonderful as I purchased it at the drive thru.  My husband and I shared this platter about an hour later we both felt like the food hit bottom our our stomach like lead! I think it's the oil used and therefore we will not get anything else fried from this restaurant unless it's grilled. Their salads are great. The cheesecake is terrible but banana pudding is ok."}
{"text":"I have been going to chicken king for the past 2 &1/2 years and have never had an issue. On Wednesday night me and my boyfriend were craving Chicken King. I never try things new I stick to my original buffalo chicken sandwich. But this time I order the Ribeye Steak Sandwich. When I went to take my first bite what seemed like skin to me wouldn't come off.. After looking at it I realized my ribeye steak was wrapped in PLASTIC... And the sandwich was cooked with the PLASTIC left on there then served to me. My boyfriend took it up to the register and they immediately gave him his money back.. So apparently that happens a lot. Not sure I can get past that so we will not be returning to this Chicken King for quiet awhile."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way to the airport because of phenomenal Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint! I got the gyros, my boyfriend got the steak sandwich and we shared a side of hush puppies and they were both delicious. Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"visited for the first time today,ordered 2 piece chicken dinner,the chicken must have been on a diet or was not being fed for days up till his demise because there was no meat at all and it tasted like pork skins out of a bag.they did give me about a pound of fries with the order ,if you name your business chicken king you better knock the socks off with the chicken plates,i will avoid this place and just go to bojangles or kfc next time!"}
{"text":"The girls that work the front are friendly. They treat everyone like family. The food is great and there's usually a very minimal wait time."}
{"text":"They ok just slow if you going have a drive thur they need to move a little faster than they do."}
{"text":"They have some of the best chef salads in town. Their bacon cheeseburger combo is good as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, reasonably priced. Was especially impressed w/overall cleanliness and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The food here is really good in the price is great as well. You can get a sampler platter which has chicken tenders, fish, shrimp, Hush Puppies, fries, & a drink all for only $9.99. I think a lot of people don't know about this place because they really don't advertise. I hope they do well and stick around as it is a good place to eat in Kannapolis."}
{"text":"Love this place and the people. The cashiers are the soul of the place. The food is southern comfort. Family oriented and good price."}
{"text":"I have found nothing here that isn't 5 star.  The food is great, the staff is very courteous and fun, and a great atmosphere.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Some of our favorites included the Reuben, the flounder box and bbq pork sandwiches. Large delicious portions. We all walked away very satisfied. Oh, the onion rings were to die for."}
{"text":"Just discovered Chicken King a few months ago.  The Grilled Chicken Salad and Greek Salad are great.  The chicken is grilled with Greek seasoning.  The Gyro was excellent, and I really like the Chicken Pita!  Remember to spring for the Tzatziki (cha-cheeky) sauce! It's fantastic!  The fries that accompany most orders are your typical crinkle cuts with a little bit of seasoning on them. They are nothing to write home about but they are usually hot.  I see a lot of folks ordering wings, fried chicken, and the fish plate here, but I haven't worked my way through all of the menu yet.    The building is an old gas station that has been painted bright orange on the outside. There is not much sit-in ambiance but it is good place to grab something hot, fast, and tasty.  The salads are high on iceberg lettuce but provide somewhat of a healthy alternative.  I have three friends who regularly get the salads here and they swear by them."}
{"text":"It's was ok, but then they changed cooks and possibly management. Just bland and cheap if you're on a budget. Not somewhere I would eat frequently."}
{"text":"With a name like chicken king I thought they would only have fried chicken.  I got a great Greek salad when they changed the sign and was pleasantly surprised.  It is much closer than showmars with a similar menu.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Salads and food are always fresh, hot and delicious.  The dine in area could use some updati g.  Their shrimp and fish plates are great, but i got a chef salad this time which was also delicious as usual. Quick service."}
{"text":"super cheap and great food! i live down the street and probably go to chicken king at least 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that it's a dive scare you off. They've got great crinkle cut fries, an awesome fish sandwich (perch or whiting), tartar-y tartar sauce, and flavorful hush puppies (I think they put onion in them). I've eaten here quite a few times and the food is always perfectly cooked and made to order. The prices are very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment for the first time two weeks ago. Very little seating and not the nicest decor, but who cares. The food was awesome. I ordered the tilapia plate and I couldn't eat it right away because it was smoking hot! The fish was so good. The coleslaw taste like KFC's, hush puppies and fries were good also. Needless to say I came back two days later for the same items, but this time I bought my bff with me and she had the catfish plate. After finally taking a breather from eating she said it was awesome! The portions are large and believe me  you won't leave hungry unless you shared your plate with some one and even then you won't be starving. Next time I will try the chicken."}
{"text":"Stopped by the drive thru after the gym for a Greek salad. The salad was a big portion with plenty of chicken but the olives weren't pitted and they didn't offer Greek dressing. The salad itself was quite tasty and fresh. The person at the drive thru was polite and very helpful."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the chicken, calabash shrimp, all the sides and their delicious desserts. Great prices and nice portions"}
{"text":"I have now been to 3 of these locations and this one is by far my favorite. Although the building is small and the seating is limited the food is amazing and fast. The Philly, made on soft local bread with just a touch of toasting, means you can enjoy your Philly without wearing it.  I highly recommend you make them your 'spot' to pick up dinner that you don't want to cook. Be sure to call ahead to avoid a delay. The whole family will be happy."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best fried chicken in Charlotte, which says something coming from a New Orleanian! Great value especially the family meals. Fried okra was soo good!  Plenty of parking and you can call ahead if you want to get in and out. They also have seating so you can sit and enjoy your chicken when fresh!"}
{"text":"The collards were under done severely, despite being very greasy & it being the end of the day. We ordered an 8 piece chicken meal, mixed light & dark. We got 10 pieces, but only 1 breast, the rest dark (which we appreciated the extra pieces in lieu of the other breast). We did not receive the promised rolls however. The chicken was ok, but not spectacular. The potato salad was quite good though! The tea was good too. To begin with, the service was too.   What was really not good though, was as we were wrapping up to leave, it was closing time, and our son ran across the restaurant (he was acting up as it was close to bed time and he is 4- they implode). I went to chase him and slipped and fell down on the wet floor. I told them they needed to put the wet floor sign up, the guy mopping said tersely, \"it was out.\" I looked again on my way out the door and yes, there was the wet floor sign, stuck in between two tables where I would never have seen it if I hadn't looked for it. My knee is all bruised and hurting now, and to add insult to injury, one of the girls behind the counter muttered to herself loud enough for me to hear, \"that kid needs his ass whooped\" !!!!!!!   This is why you get two stars, Chicken King, and we will not be back. It's not your employees place to say crap like that. At least have the basic Southern decency to wait until I'm gone before you start talking about me and my rambunctious kid."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you wouldn't think might be kind of questionable, but is actually pretty nice.  It's right next to a gas station which doesn't help with that image, nor does the parking situation. but once you get inside it has the atmosphere of a neighborhood diner.  The food was very well done, very fresh and tasty.  The chicken club was very good, with the cheese melted all over it.  The only thing that could have really been improved upon was the service.  The girls looked bored and like they didn't really want to be there.  But then again they also looked like they were in high school, and trying to make teenagers happy is a pointless effort."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken king in Charlotte the staff is amazing and the food is always delicious they make everything fresh and you can call in your order I recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This location will put you on the toilet my entire dinner part had to go before we even left the parking lot  it's like they cool all there food with laxatives"}
{"text":"Traffic jam on the highway led us into Mt. Holly around lunchtime, and we smelled this place before we saw it - mmmmmm... the smell of roasting chicken!  So we decided to pop on by.  I ordered some grilled chicken with fries, barbecue sauce on the side, and it was TASTY.  The chicken was hot and juicy and tender - cooked perfectly.  The dish came with a bed of fries and cole slaw, which they let me substitute for mac&cheese for free!  The mac&cheese was just OK but again, served at a good temperature, and the crinkly fries also hit the spot.  It was just a perfect, filling lunch for a good price.  You order at the front counter and then they bring the food to your table.  Service is very fast.  I found the booths to be quite comfortable and the bathrooms clean.  This was a solid, delicious meal for a roadtrip and I am almost glad about the traffic jam because otherwise we would have missed this place!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times and just kept on driving.  It definitely looks pretty hood, but it always seems to be busy.  So, I had to give it a shot.  I love finding little secret ghetto hole in the wall spots and was hoping for a little gem.  This was not that place.  I'm not going to lie, the fried chicken was pretty good and cheap as well, worth at least 3 stars.  That said, there is no seating, its crazy hot inside, and the tea was probably the most overly sweetened thing I've ever tasted.  You know a \"soul food\" place isn't worth going back to if the collard greens and green beans aren't amazing, much less barely edible.  On top of that my onion rings tasted like fish.  It didn't come through on the chicken, but there is no way they change their oil on a regular basis.  Even though it was good, the chicken was a little greasy.  Hate hate hate.  Just not my thing, but I'm sure a burger and fries or chicken gyro for under $5 is going to be better than any fast food place."}
{"text":"Dont' get me wrong, the chicken is good, but when I go to a straight up fried chicken place right near the hood, I want EPIC.  5 stars compared to KFC.  Its on the edge of a strip mall next to a gas station right on sugar creek.  Great location for a drive through window type place, but thats not the case.  I went in to buy a BUNCH of chicken for all the wonderful people that had just helped me move.  It took a lot longer than I expected but that was some good fried chicken.  Lots of batter, really crunchy, and juicy chicken inside.  Had some cole slaw as a side and yet again, good, but nothing truly special."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood, and I there is no fast food with in walking distance of the place i moved to, and I have no car, and one of my neighbors told me they had great food there, Well my family and I being very hungry one night, and not having a way to the grocery store until in the morning, we decided to go here, now I cant say much about there chicken, but we ordered a cheeseburger and large fry, and OMG, it was delicious!! We have been going back there and ordering from them ever since, and it is family ran, and you always see the same nice smiling faces!!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Chicken King since moving to Charlotte. I'd heard nothing but good things about this place so I was pretty sure everyone couldnt be wrong!  I went with some co-workers and everyone got something different which was a great way for me to know what else I want to try on the menu. I ordered a chicken sandwhich, my co-workers ordered the chicken philly, philly with steak and peppers and fried fish.  My chicken sandwich was messy, but delicious! It's a grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato I swapped the mayo for hot sauce and it was perfect. The fries were cooked up fresh to order and for less than $8 I left full and happy.  Yep. I'll be back to give more of their menu a try!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely queen of the mom and pops and hole-on-the-walls and well let's be honest, pretty much food in general. This place may get lost in sight and not too easy on the eyes but is what I look forward to after a long day at work. The food is terrible for my heart and arteries, but just oh so comforting. I've loved everything I've gotten here from the Seafood Platters to the Fried Chicken and even a simple, Cheeseburger with Fries. I do try to stay away as much as possible for purpose of attempting to be healthy, but that just leads to withdrawal and grumpiness. Also, this place is within minutes of my place...."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken King and normally eat there about 3 times a week. the sad part is they have changed the batter on the chicken and I will no longer eat there 3 times a week."}
{"text":"We passed by this place after noticing it was no longer a Sonic and made a mental note to come by and try it.  Gotta have good chicken if you're called the Chicken King, right?  Sadly, it was average, at best.  Ordered the 8-piece chicken and though the chicken was crunchy and definitely fried, the meat was a bit overdone and dry.  The service was decent.  The staff was friendly, and though they told us that it would be fifteen minutes, it was much shorter than that.  The premises could definitely use a sprucing up.  It doesn't seem they did any sort of renovation before re-opening under their new name.  And unfortunately, there was a strange smell in the air outside the restaurant that forced us back inside after just a minute or two.  It's unlikely we'll be back with so many of the fast food chains within similar distance, and equal or better food."}
{"text":"Fish, chicken, burgers, fries, even the fully loaded salads are excellent!! It's a real hole in the wall, but the sanitation rating is an A and the food and prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Chicken King locations and this one is certainly cleaner than the the ones that I have been in. I ordered the double cheeseburger and fries and the service was pretty quick. The food tasted good as well. This location has a nice area to sit down and eat, something most locations don't have. They have a drive-thru which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, given that it takes at least 5 minutes per customer to get their order. You might as well walk in. The staff here is friendly and polite. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Just like the previous reviewer, I've driven by this place hundreds of times, and always asked myself the same question, \"What the hell goes on in there??\"  Earlier this week, I finally got the courage to give Chicken King a try.  Upon walking in, i was struck by how small it was.  From the outside, it looks much bigger than it is.  I'm not gonna lie, the place feels a little grimy as well, but DON'T Let that detour you..  ...I decided to go with the BBQ sandwich w/slaw.  Something pretty standard, that any legit southern joint should be able to do right.  After about a 4-5min wait, my sandwich came to me dripping with class as it was brought to me wrapped in foil and in a brown paper bag.   Upon arriving back at my house a minutes away (there is no where to sit inside Chicken King - must take to go), I dramatically unwrapped the sandwich from the foil and discovered a taste that was, well... nothing but first class.  It had a nice smokey flavor and was well sauced.  The slaw was cold and crunchy and complimented the sandwich perfectly,  It was also well-priced at less than $5.    I would def recommend at least giving Chicken King a shot...I'm not making any promises, but I think you may be pleasantly surprised..."}
{"text":"It took me weeks to find this place. The MapQuest directions just \"drop\" you off in no-man's land.  The restaurant is non-assuming but the food? Ohhh, the food. I had a sandwich and fries and left with a happy and very full belly. And, sticky fingers from the delicious dressing that ran down my fingers..."}
{"text":"A while back the food wasn't good at all. The quality of the food has improved significantly! The food now looks and tastes good including the chicken. I had to update my review just to be fair. By the way..the staff is really friendly which is also a good thing. We all know how hard that is to find!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna talk about two things here during this review, both positive. First off, on yesterday I visited Chicken King on Nations Ford for the very first time. I usually go to the location on S Tryon but I moved recently and discovered this location through Yelp that is only 6 min from my house. I went in and placed my order, a 3 piece chicken dinner. Other customers arrived during my wait as they cook to order. I noticed the very nice and pleasant young cashier explaining that their telephone lines were down rendering their credit card reader useless. I then notice instead of refusing to serve the pending prepared food they were simply serving to go orders without pay (for free)and doing so nicely. I had no cash either, just my debit and credit cards. When my order was ready she asked me nicely to just take it and not worry about it. I felt so bad. If I'd refused it would have been waste anyway which is also bad. So I had the cashier print me a receipt so I could present it and pay next time I come in just to ease my own conscience. I will go back in to pay my bill today. By the way, the food was absolutely delicious! I am now a new customer proudly so. I would advise them to close the store next time this happens until resolved. There are people who would take advantage of such kindness and dedication to superior customer service unfortunately. Great people and great food!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty much what I expected...although they do take credit cards.  I expected a place with a line with cheap food.  Things I did not expect: I didn't see any soda.  It seemed to just be tea/lemonade and a couple other beverages.  Maybe I missed the soda, but it did not appear to be here.  If you need soda you may want to visit the c-store next door.  I was hoping for chicken tenders.  It seems that Chicken King has wings and pieces, but no tenders.  I got the fried chicken sandwich with fries instead.  The fries are the crinkle cut style that bring back memories of school lunch.    The place is around the corner and I felt it is a good value so I will most likely return a few times a year."}
{"text":"Back in the day spot with the big burgers and chicken sandwiches for those late night munchies or when you want to pass on the Calf food. Same folks still run and cook the food from 1990's. Prices are cheap even on a college budget."}
{"text":"Liver and onions buttered corn and pintos all hot well cooked and delicious. There have been several restaurants at this location but this is by far the best. Mount Holly has another great place to dine."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of not calling my order in ahead of time. I ordered 8 lemon pepper wings and onion rings. They weren't what I would call very busy, but the wait was pretty long. I wont make that mistake again.  Waiting long gave me the chance to sit down and look around. I will say that the employees were nice, but the place looked like it could use a good cleaning day. I mean, I'm originally from NJ/NY area, so I have no problem eating from a \"less than pristine\" place. You should see the corner stores and food trucks I was raised from. It's not terrible, but it needs some work............ unless that's the look they are going for.  Anyway, I will say that the was impressed with the food..... both the chicken and onion rings. It's not the closest spot to me, but it was still pretty good. Even the ranch dressing/dip was good.  It is the kind of small business I would support."}
{"text":"Love,love,love this place. The food is great and the management and crew are all wonderful. I go here at least once a week and the food is always fabulous."}
{"text":"So glad we stumbled upon his place. The food is absolutely incredible, prices are great and the service is top notch. We have tried several things here and everything has been great! Fish sandwich, shrimp and chicken platter, onion rings are to die for, tarter sauce is homemade, salad is great with lots of chicken on it. Be sure to get the house dressing it is great! Highly recommend this place! Just wish they were open a little later."}
{"text":"This was a nice little surprise that we located in downtown Mount Holly. We went twice in one week. The staff is so friendly & seems to know everyone who walked in the door. On my first visit I got chicken and dumplings which were as good as my moms. I also got green beans & corn. The green beans are seasoned just right. Every thing was delicious. We returned two days later, and I liked the green beans so much that I got them again along with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. The chicken was delicious. I am a fan of Bojangles chicken, but thought this was better. Great place to get a meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The chicken tastes as good as my great grandma used to make, so I almost always get a two piece meal with fried okra, but everything I've ordered had been excellent! They have daily specials, and you can switch out your sides if you like on your meals. My husband also loves their burgers. This is a no frills, casual place - like a lot of small restaurants in NC. The best part though? The staff here is amazing! They treat you like family."}
{"text":"I use to eat here often but the d8ning always seems very hot inside and it kinda smells burnt and greasy. I found that I can get better chicken somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered the flounder dinner. Generous portions.My meal was delicious. It came with the fish, cole slaw, french fries, and hush puppies. The only thing working against them is the appearance of the establishment, it looks a bit tattered but the food makes up for it. Also this is not a sit down establishment like the one in SW Charlotte. Business is family run."}
{"text":"Chicken king comes through when cooking is not an option or my coworkers and I need a quick fix, chicken king is it. I hate they're not open on Sunday's. I typically get the shrimp, fi sh and fries. Honestly, the only thing I was able to eat during the 1st 3 months of my pregnancy too lol. Solid & delicious fast food!"}
{"text":"I came here because it's close to my hotel, just to grab a quick lunch. But the chicken is like my grandmother used to make back in the 60s. Really good!"}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME! I ordered the deluxe cheeseburger with fries. The people working here are  very professional as well. However, I wouldn't recommend coming here at night due to the neighborhood. I thought I was on an episode of Cops. But if you like great food and you enjoy people watching, definitely stop by. But for God's sake be sure to lock your car."}
{"text":"OMG! Run, don't walk, run to this place and get yourself a flounder plate. Enough food for two people easily and hot and fresh as it gets. Very nice folks, too."}
{"text":"The chicken chef salad is the best!!!! I am a fan, I havent tried anything else because that was a hit with me."}
{"text":"This was recommended by the hotel I was stay at due to it's close proximity. I ordered the flounder, shrimp, hush puppies and cole slaw. What I failed to find out until the order arrived was that it was all fried. I am not a fan of deep fried food I was disappointed with the food. The person working was very friendly and personable, the empty tables were still dirty and the place was empty when I arrived.  I really wouldn't recommend unless you like fried food or are Hangry."}
{"text":"I love Chicken King but the Nations Ford location is terrible. I went there twice. First time I figured it was just a bad day because I never have any complaints at the other WT Harris location but no.... 2nd time was just as bad. Got the fish & shrimp. Fish was hard like they fried it too long. And possibly in the chicken grease because it smelled like I had a chicken plate. Fries were overcooked. Not sure how u mess up fries. Oh, and the hushpuppies were overcooked. Just a bad spot to eat from. I recommend Chicken King but not this location."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders! Great salads! Their ranch dressing is homemade and aaaaamazing!!"}
{"text":"When we pulled up I was worried. When I started to eat the food all doubt was erased. The food was great"}
{"text":"tried this location several times, not impressed.  Service is unfriendly and the fries are always under cooked.  I dont know how you can mess up fries every time, but this place does it.  Pretty much hit or miss but a cheap meal."}
{"text":"I just left this resteraunt  for the 2nd time for the same meal.  So upset I did a call in order for  pickup the meal was 2 chicken  liver and gizzard dinners went to pickup meal and bring home the upsetting  part was I was missing my gizzards.  I called back and was told I did not say gizzards  but, bring back meal.  So I am upset no apology  and when I get there is was told I had to pay 85cents more.  Now after using my 85cents in gas to go back for a corrected meal I could not get over them asking for more money which I paid and decided  I would never go there again"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru - ordered fried chicken sandwich and onion rings. They handed me a grilled chicken sandwich and when I said I requested fried, the lady said \"Are you sure?\" ..... They fixed it relatively quickly. Bread was stale around the edges, the chicken was chewy, but the fried flavor was decent. Onion rings had almost zero flavor. Not impressed whatsoever with the food or customer service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"As a Chinese person who can't read Chinese, Chinese businesses sometimes don't know what to do with me. Case in point. They don't have an English menu here. I had to ask the man at the counter to translate it for me. There were at least six things with prices. He told me two. It's not the end of the world. Basically, they specialize in hand-pulled chicken. Or hand-shredded. However you want to put it. They cook the chicken, shred it, then season it. I'm still trying to figure out what the seasoning is. It tastes like Chinese seasoning salt but without the salt. Hrm... Whatever it is, it's super tasty. Grandma kept going back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered the whiting and shrimp and it was amazing! My girlfriend has the calabash shrimp dinner both of us ate for less than $20 the food was overflowing, well seasoned and just absolutely delish! My new fav spot when I come to this side of town! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week.  Was a spur of the moment stop as I was not feeling great, didn't have a dinner plan and the 2 toddlers of mine were starving! Talk about excellent service from the staff!  Not to mention great food!  Large portions for a great price...plus Pepsi on tap!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Welp, they still won't sell me a leg and a thigh! But ya know who will?? Wal-Mart! Yep! And all for a a buck ninety-eight plus tax. And if you get it fresh it is really good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location after having a bad experience at a different location. Place was busy. Lots of customers waiting for orders. Take out place. Only a few stools to sit on while you wait. There  is one table with chairs, but it was designated \"For employees only\". Ordered the fried croaker dinner. A ton of food! Two huge pieces of croaker with fries, slaw, hush puppies and tarter sauce. Around 8 dollars and enough food for two people (unless you have a really big appetite). The tarter sauce was okay, a little too onion-y for me, but I like mine sweet. The fries were hot and crispy.They have a big container of seasoned salt to shake onto them. Also, hot sauce, salt and pepper, and ketchup.I say this because you need to open your order and add these things before you leave the restaurant. They don't bother with those fancy little ketchup packets and salt and pepper and whatnot. The hushpuppies were delicious! But the star of the meal was the fried croaker itself. Fried to crispy perfection! It was so hot I couldn't wait to eat it and almost burned my tongue. It tasted fresh and a tad salty, but not too salty. Wish this place was closer to my house! I was just driving through the neighborhood when I spotted and pulled in. On second thought, maybe it's a good thing it's NOT close to my house! I would be tempted to order from there every night!"}
{"text":"Stop in today. The place is not much to look at. I asked the very polite young girl behind the counter what was good. She said,\"Everything\".  I asked her to recommend something and she strangely said the Double cheeseburger. So I ordered that and the Gyro just in case. I was very pleased! The burger was what a burger should be! I would order that again for sure, but maybe in a week so so after I work this one off. Only took a bite of the Gyro just to see, it too was good! The prices are great and the food is too! I'm only in town for a few days but they will be seeing me everyday until I leave!"}
{"text":"DELISH!!! Every and anytime I go there and no matter what I get is always sooooo good!! Everyone is always so friendly and out going. The restaurant is clean and they are always busy."}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant about coming to this place since the Sonic was terrible, however I decided to stop by, and they were running already while continuing the set up. First of all the owner is very nice as well as his daughter, both were very friendly, gave us recommendations even to save some bucks. Also complimented us with sweet tea, personally I am not a fan of sweet tea, but their tea is amazing.  They do take a little long to serve, but that is because they don't start cooking until you order it. I much rather get something fresh and juicy, other than dry and cold. The chicken is amazing, so juicy and tender and big pieces too. Their Baklava is amazing.   I decided to go again and try something else from their menu, their burgers are really good, this is the first place where they actually make a good BACON CHEESEBURGER, they put a lot of bacon and it is crispy, their seafood, amazing as well, everyone in there looks happy always smiling and very polite.   Looks like they are finally done, and it looks great, definitely worth the shot. The sonic had a terrible reputation but I'm glad they replaced it, because I love their chicken. Only thing i got against it... sundays they are closed."}
{"text":"Eat here a lot. Only have had 1 bad experience where grilled chicken tastes like a raw onion. Everything else I have ever ordered has been good. I recommend the pork chop sandwich, trout, beef tips, greens, and of course the homemade ranch. Yum."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here for lunch. Overall I have enjoyed everything I've tried. I've only eaten take out via Foodsby so I can't comment on location."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food & a sweet staff. They are so welcoming and always have a smile. The atmosphere itself is great. I love going here to eat"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've eaten here more times than I can count and everything (including the chicken sandwich) is amazing. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Double Bacon Cheeseburger Combo with fries.  Great food.  Rivals a 5 Guys burger, and much cheaper."}
{"text":"News flash fish does not smell fishy. IF you think it does then you have never had fresh fish.. I had never been to this place and it will be the last.People can in the door but I think most of them were walking.One person  was eating a hot dog (he was walking) ask him how the food ? He told me..\"it's close I walked\" How hard is it to make chicken wings? .hush puppies  how do you mess up frozen ones..To those who walk there try PBJ. DOES NOT SMELL  LIKE FISH.GEES.."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best chicken in charlotte. Family owned restaurant specializing in fried chicken. They have a range of other foods on the menu as well, mostly southern comfort foods, but also all the good american foods like burgers, hot dogs, shrimp, and fish. They also have gyros which is nice. I used to go to prices but this place makes them look like amateurs. Prices are great as well, you can get enough chicken for 2 people for less than ten dollars."}
{"text":"Love it every time Services are fast an food is always on point great prices an friendly staff, would definitely recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Just came here and it's closed! Pretty disappointing as an out of Towner that got excited and came strictly via the reviews..."}
{"text":"Came for the fried chicken and while everything on the menu was tempting (salads, burgers, sandwiches), stuck to my guns and ordered the fried chicken. Smart decision - the breast was moist, skin perfectly crispy and still can't believe the whole dinner with 2 sides was less than $10. Will come back for more for sure. Came home with each of their homemade cakes (strawberry, lemon and coconut) and they are amazing!!!! Friendly people, treat you like you are part of the family."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to chicken king but what I just got is not the chicken king I had 1.5yrs ago... Horrible not worth the 8 bucks I spent no more"}
{"text":"Great delivery and take out service. No longer an eat-in restaurant, but you can always hang out at the cigar bar across the street, grab a drink, and they'll run the food over to you! Burgers are great, crinkle cut fries. Also got the naked wings-they are BIG and were cooked perfectly.  Very friendly but can get busy. Don't give up if you try to call and don't get through!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for some takeout from the previous good reviews. The staff up front was courteous and we tried a couple different things, the bone in chicken and the tenders dinner. Each came with two sides and were plenty of food.  The bone in chicken had great flavor and the breading was light and crispy. Hot and juicy, my only complaint is it was pretty greasy, maybe needs a higher temperature on the fryer.   The tenders were perfect. Same great flavors and lightness in the breading without the grease. Would probably get this over the other chicken next time.   The Mac and cheese was quite good, not overcooked mush like at many other places. The okra was cut big enough and fried just right.  I noted the dining room was large and clean while I waited. Good food, we will be back to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Prices are fair but it definitely won't be my new favorite place to go when I come home to visit. The mac and cheese was terrible and I would whether have had GMO filled fake cheese having Kraft before having ever had tasted and ingested there mac and cheese.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo as well and that I can say was their saving grace on this review as it was perfectly seasoned and piping hot and delicious!  The customer service was amazing and we were greeted by a friendly voice and they were extremely patient while my husband and I were deciding upon what to order. I would say that this is definitely a place worth trying for the prices you really can't lose."}
{"text":"Drove all the way up here from SC. The only negatives were the cashier lady that weren't so friendly. She seem a little impatient as we were deciding on what to order and was given us a attitude. There were no one else in there but us so we didn't understand why we felt rushed.  Sides dishes substitution are  extra cost even if the items are the same price and water was not free.  Other than that the food was good."}
{"text":"That is the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken I ever did see and the inside omg This is a must to drive to eat if your anywhere near !  Don't believe any of the bad reviews  Everyone has a bad day  This is the best and the best value anywhere   If you get Bojangles instead of driving a little further  to this place your a fool to do so!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I visited this location. My friend loved her Pork Chop meal and they gave her an extra one. :-).   Great Food and affordable!"}
{"text":"First time I visited this location the food was ok, second time it was ok. Third time the charm..not! Ok so I arrived to place my order at 1:18pm received at 1:45pm I've asked for a cup of water cashier charged me .25 cents. Ok cool but dame as long as I waited they should have just given it to me. Then as they give you your order they ask you to check your bag/plate before leaving...hmmm. They have 3 signs up stating no refund, check your order before leaving. I probably will not return for one, the order took to long to prepare and my chicken sandwich was greasy was that pleasing., oh and they over cooked the fries."}
{"text":"A very strange experience. Me and my husbands first time there and the cashier and cook are arguing with a lady. Granted the lady was very very rude and should learn some manners...... that ruined the cashier from there on out, she was very rude and kept making mistakes. Just a really awful experience... it was our first time, and it was our last"}
{"text":"Every time I've ever come here the service is fast, and friendly the food is surprisingly good whether that being wings, or salad its good filling and fresh! Im going to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good Neighborhood Food. Great menu with lots of specials to choose from."}
{"text":"The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good. This place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"OH GOD the chicken is so addictive, can't stop reaching out for more...  The restaurant is intended for fast take-outs, more people would come here to order and leave within 5 minutes. They do have two tables that could sit total of 10 people and offer combo meals, but it is still the fast take-out convenience that attracts the customers.  Chicken King is most famous for its hand shredded salty chicken. Granted that I have had better hand shredded chicken elsewhere (better mix of spices for the flavour), the hand shredded chicken here still deserves a good rating on its own. The meat is tender and the skin is soft like jelly. Once you try it you just want more. I find the flavour to be a bit too salty actually, but you can always eat it over rice or bring it to work for lunch with a salad like I do.   The portion in the take-out container is deceiving actually -- they bury the bones at the bottom to make it seem like you get more meat than you actually do. But hey, the bones are perfect for making congee or soup, gives really good flavour."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem of a fried chicken heaven. Great prices, great fried chicken. A lot of choices for any group. Cakes made in house by owners and are fantastic. I had the four piece chicken with onion rings (also made in house) and potato salad. Best fried chicken north of Charlotte. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Occupying a former Sonic, but with all the drive up stuff removed and just a simple drive through remaining, there's a very small area to line up and then place your order. It's burgers and fries and chicken wings, mostly. Some salads, too.  At lunch time, the place was packed with pickup trucks and work vans as the place was full up with blue collar workers getting their lunch on. I heard lots of orders for the \"chicken wing dinner\" being called out, so I'm guessing it's good?  I just had a grilled chicken sub and it was decent. A lot of hot chicken, chopped into cubes and served with the usual fixings and then topped with provolone cheese. Tasty. And a big mess of fries too."}
{"text":"They need better customer service... the owner is a ass hole.... seems like he has no respect for customers... been there a few times and it seem they forget something everytime and i have to wait after i called in my order... last time i went they didn't even have my order after i called it in... owner ask me did i call the right number... i felt like duh you are the only one in this town... i asked if i could have my chicken on the side... i got a salad and he was an ass hole about that... like buddy maybe you should go and let someone else run your business... it cost nothing to show your customers a little respect... i gave it 4 tries THANK GOD FOR SHOW MARS"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I am a city girl and this food reminds me of small restaurants on every block in NY. Privately owned, cheap and tasty. Best things about this place are below. 1.Large space if you so feel compelled to eat here with a group there are booths and tables all throughout. 2.Price- this food is cheap. fish & 2 sides $8 roughly. excellent. And heaping portions 3. Taste- food is good, i stick to what i know because i have been let down a lot from restaurants but the food i have had is excellent. The hush puppies are perfect.  4.Large menu- bottom line there is something for everyone. definitely going to be something every person would choose. 5. condiments- you can get what you need, and as much as you need. They are not cheapskates here. load up on ketchup or hot sauce, or whatever. 6. service- its not rocket science but the people I have help me were always kind and friendly.  JUST GO HERE. THE END."}
{"text":"By far the best Chicken King in Charlotte. The West Blvd location is good too, but this is #1. I order the Perch dinner usually which they give great portions. I always get an extra cup of tartar sauce to dip my fries in because the tartar sauce is delish! You can get 2 meals off of one dinner. The Bacon cheeseburger, fried mozzarella sticks, and salads are good too."}
{"text":"Great Chicken! make sure you order ahead of time! Young guys taking orders but be patient with them and tip!"}
{"text":"No sharing drinks allowed, since theres free refills.. really!?? And the drink doesn't come with the special? Why not? Its already expensive as is!"}
{"text":"We went to Chicken King. We were greeted when we walked through the door  it's always nice to be recognized.   We ordered and I always get gizzards dinner With HOT SAUCE!  They brought our food out to us. I got 3 refills on the tea and OMG its really good.  The restaurant  is so clean and looks great.  They always have a special of the day.  My partner got the special of the day it was a perch dinner and the hushpuppy's were great. The perch was a little to fishie tasting and a few bones.  The fish was fried and to much gray skin.  It should be cleaned off every time.   Thanks for GREAT FOOD AND STAFF!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the customer service is top notch!! I've gotten the Gyro twice and it was one of the best I've had in my life both times!!"}
{"text":"Chicken king is nothing fancy but it gets the job done. I routinely order the chicken philly from here and it never disappoints. They are very generous with the amount of chicken that they give you. The fries... definitely need work. The service is typically fast and friendly, they have a drive thru but I've never utilized it. Definitely worth a visit for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The Greek Salad here is awesome! The chicken is seasoned perfect, the portion was big, and the convenience of call&pickup makes this place a must for a quick lunch or dinner. Try their banana pudding for desert! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"We have always got good food. But they have the best salads around. The Greek is my favorite but the other ones are good to. My husband likes the grilled Pork chops. He says they have a good flavor and are tender. You get plenty of food for your money. Chicken tips are great as well. Friendly service. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the gyro and found it to be one of the best around. The staff are amazingly friendly and seem to know what their customers want even before they get to the counter. I would highly recommend this place just on customer service alone. Not to mention they have an extensive menu from burgers to chicken gizzards."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and it's always exceeded my expectations.  Very casual atmosphere with a super friendly staff.  They make you feel right at home.  We've had the chicken salad sandwich, chicken tenders box, fried chicken combo, green beans, mac and cheese, and collards.  Everything is delicious and cooked to order, at very reasonable prices.  We love this place and will be back often."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years now. I would have given them 5 stars but because of the terrible location, I had to knock off a star. It's Rozzelles Ferry so expect the worst. Hide your valuables & lock your car! On our most recent visit, my husband and I witnessed the corner store being robbed. We literally saw the thief take off running down the sidewalk across the street. If you're a tourist & not familiar with the area, seeing stuff like this would definitely scare in the other direction. But guess I was just used to seeing things like that so it didn't really stop me from frequenting this local joint.   Ok, with that said, let's move on to the food. I always go for the Chicken Tender Platter. It's only 5 & some change and the portion is huge! The chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked. The slaw is pretty good. The menu is basic enough. The value is great for the quality and portion that you get.   The owner and his family is very sweet. They're always so courteous, friendly, polite, etc. These folks are great peeps. The parking lot, the exterior, & interior will make you want to get back in your car and leave. But trust me, the food is great and on point. Give them a chance. They won't disappoint! I would definitely revisit...despite of the of the multiple crimes I've witnessed on this street."}
{"text":"I usually don't like waiting here since last time we vacationed, my parents brought home heaping amounts of roast pork and duck. Chicken is very fresh and leaves no scent lingering in the van. We must have brought home at least 5 boxes of their specialty shredded chicken. Almost boneless shredded chicken meat with seasoning and sesame seeds as well as a whole chopped chicken. Was so good for the next 4 dinners. Grandma really enjoyed it too :) A very down to earth butcher shop ~"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great and served quickly.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is super-friendly and appeciative of your business.  You have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pita, fried okra, and fried OMGosh get in my belly ... It's the only thing I've ever gotten. It's good!! Cooked to order so don't rush them... Why wouldn't you wait for that?!?  Staff is always nice, even when I put my pick up order in late. Fair prices, and always clean."}
{"text":"2 meals 2 drinks and $2.00 tip= only $21.00 2 pc. Fried chicken, mac & cheese (Kraft like), crinkle cut fries. 5 wings/ good portion on gizzards, (fried a little to crisp), Amazingly good fried yellow squash, and slaw. Nice people, very casual atmosphere.  But we were impressed with the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"It's a dive but don't be fooled the burgers are good, however I wasn't in love with the chicken wings at all."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and know many customers on a first name basis. Great place if you want simple and real good food. I eat here at least once a week. I always order the flounder plate but they have a pretty large menu."}
{"text":"We had driven by this place many times but never stopped for a bite. Until last night. And since then I have been asking myself why I didn't stop here earlier.  Sure, I'll be honest, the outside looks sketchy. In fact, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here alone after dark, especially if you are a girl. But at the same time, I'll say you definitely SHOULD go here because this is such a diamond we found in the coal!  When we got here, I asked the owner what was good. He recommended the house special double cheeseburger, which my boyfriend got, and absolutely loved. I didn't see a po' boy sandwich on the menu but was in the mood for one so asked the owner and he said they could make me one. And I was glad they did. It was delicious! I can't wait to go back here and try some more stuff on their menu. Although they call themselves \"Chicken King,\" they have seafood, beef, lamb and pork as well.  Tip: Minimum purchase of $5 required for credit cards."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever.. They service was extremely slow and the cashier was so rude to myself and other people around me. The cashier got so mad at someone trying to explain to her what they wanted she called the lady a stupid ass.. I will Never eat from this place again"}
{"text":"Love this place when I come to Charlotte! Right across from my hotel, very secluded so you have to know it's here. Lovely grilled chicken salad."}
{"text":"Great fried fish great chicken wonderful homemade desserts the staff is awesome friendly quick and efficient great for lunches or take-home dinners.  I personally love the perch dinner and there hushpuppies are perfect everyone should try Chicken King off South Tryon at least once because I know it will bring you back!"}
{"text":"Pretty great fast food I have tried the Chicken Philly it was pretty good and the buffalo chicken pita was my favorite. The cheesecake was not the best. Also the chicken wings had no flavor I did not care to much for them."}
{"text":"Needs a really really good cleaning. When you deep fry every day, all day it takes a lot of work to keep it clean. Food is ok."}
{"text":"Their bacon cheeseburger has changed my life. I've also heard great things about the fish. Ignore the look of this place - if everything inside is even half as good as the bacon cheeseburger, you deserve to taste it. Treat yo' self!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the last few years and it was fine. I stopped in yesterday and ordered a flounder plate. The fish was still swimming! It was rancid! I informed the young man behind the counter and he was not bothered by it whatsoever! He never offered us any reason or another plate of food! Just do not eat here! It is very ghetto and people come in half naked with crusty ashy skin!  It is a filthy place to eat!   Hood chicken King!  The employees do not care what they feed you!"}
{"text":"With a name like Chicken King, I always thought this place only sold chicken. LOL. I would never stop because didn't have a taste for chicken. My friend and I stopped to try it out. Food was pretty good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru looked at the menu to see what i want I get immediate rude service from the skinney African American girl... she says hello welcome to chicken king can I take your order I said hold on one second she screams HEELLLOOWWW... I politely said one second she says ok take ya time with an attitude I never once got rude that's not my thing. I finish my order get to the second window she flings the window open says you ah ordered the chicken Philly all the way no mushrooms and a side of hot wings which by the way where horrible just chicken already fried then later dipped in buffalo sauce but I thought it was worth a try  ok back to the story... she says and a chicken pita I said yes that's correct she says ok total is $$$ I handed her my card she kinda not all the way but almost positively snatched the card and closed the window I get my food go home and what do we have here my order is wrong Philly steak instead of a chicken Philly I go back tell the lady at the counter  that my order is wrong in the middle of her asking me what did you order drive thru girl slides literally and says you had the chicken Philly all they way no mushrooms I jus looked at her and said yes she yells literally to the cook make this a chicken Philly as I'm waiting I said to myself I don't want cold fries so I asked the lady at the counter hey are they gonna give me fresh fries or keep the ones I already have here comes drive thru girl again literally slides and says what's the problem so I continue to talk to the lady I originally started the convo with but she jus looked like this chick crazy do what she says and so the drive thru girl says WE GONE GIVE YOU SOME NEW FRIES WE AIN'T GONE GIVE YOU DA SAME ONES YEA... I jus turned around and walked off waited for my food and left worst service ever with ok food chicken to greasy and chicken in the Philly wasn't chopped enough never again."}
{"text":"Hello friends,   This is what I believe is their latest opening. When you walk in there is the counter for you to place your order. To the right of that on an elevated platform is the dining area which seem to be very spacious.   As for the food. YUMMO!!  They have daily specials. The day I went, one of the specials was a TRIPLE CHIPOTLE  BACON CHEESEBURGER w/ chilli, coleslaw and fries.  Now get this. The bacon. Ohhhhh the bacon. (As I stare off in a daze) this isn't the skinny, brittle, i-think-i-taste-bacon type deal. This is the thick cut damn that's tasty bacon. The chipotle taste is present the whole darn thing is a gift to my mouth (there's a joke somewhere in there).  Go enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"Nearby to our hotel we walked over around 6. It's tucked in the back of a strip mall and many of the stores are closed so it almost doesn't look open till you get right up next to it.  The menu is huge! From burgers to chicken, gyros, fish, and some others. It took both of us a while to decide.  I went with a spicy chicken sandwich and some hush puppies. The puppies were extra crisp and somewhat dry but passable.   The real star here though is of course the chicken and that sandwich was on point. The breast was large and cooked very well. The provolone was melted all the way around and the hot sauce was not over powering but still kicking. Fried were fries but they were the crinkle kind and kind of brought me back to childhood for a sec.  Definitely a greasy hole in the wall but they sure do it right.   Looking for a quick bite? Fried food? Take out? I'd definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Whitney and Casey are the absolute sweetest ladies I have ever met in a restaurant or anywhere that works with the public daily for that matter!  The food is delicious and the portions are huge too but the way both Casey and Whitney make everyone feel special and like family is an even better reason to eat at Chicken King in Mt.Holly!!  Don't confuse this place with the Chicken Bucket because trust me when I say they are totally different from the quality, taste and quantity of food right down to the staff!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to eat there but they just don't have a menu online. Not sure how they expect to get call in orders without any menu."}
{"text":"Currently having the steak philly and it is absolutely amazing !!! It is just perfect and tastes delicious . Definitely would recommend to everyone. Great service and great food. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in Mt. Holly! Food and service are always wonderful. The staff are super friendly and remember your name and order! Inexpensive prices, good diner food."}
{"text":"I am basing this review off take out experience. I haven't physically been to the location. My boyfriend picked me up some lunch from here and I got the 2 piece chicken box with fries and pinto beans. Everything was really good and hot and fresh. The beans were amazingly good!!! The chicken could have been a little more moist and seasoned but with some hot sauce and a little salt and pepper it hit the spot! Definitely will be back and prices were very reasonable"}
{"text":"If you want good food in a no frills restaurant , this place is for you.  First impressions as you enter is CLEAN.  So yes the food is good.  Constant flow of people through the door tells you that as well.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Walk into the restaurant the person taking the orders stop from taking our order to take a call in oder. While waiting on her to finish up the phone call they ran out of the side I wanted. Then they were out of fried chicken and it would be a 15 minute wait. 45 minutes later I went up to see what was going on. They told me that all the people were waiting on chicken also. While I was waiting to ask my question they filled 2 peoples go orders. It was another 10 they brought our order. Too much attitude from the man at the counter!!! I have ate there at least10 tomes, there will not be a next time."}
{"text":"I tried them the other night for the first time. I got their fried flounder with onion rings and slaw. It came with onion rings. It was the best fish and onion rings i've ever had. My mom went there the next day and said it wasn't as good or crispy so I guess you have to go at the right time"}
{"text":"Chicken King has become a apart of my lunch rotation and deservedly so. Yes they have a huge chicken sandwich that is both delicious and barely fits into its box. But what actually brings me back to this place is everything else on the menu. I love their Philly cheese with a dash of Italian dressing, it is addicting. I like their Gyro as well, and they put so much meat on it it's ridiculous. Love the fries, just make sure you ask for extra seasoning on them. I also appreciate the woman who works the drive thru, always so friendly. Hit up Chicken King if you are really hungry, they will give you plenty of good food. Big portions!!"}
{"text":"Ordered salad , gross.  Ordered sub, still gross.  Guess they only do fried stuff.  Don't go."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and on both occasions, I am so impressed with the service. I get that chic fil a vibe when I go. It's a drive through but they are so friendly. This last I ordered wings and fries, they weren't as good as I remembered. I think the oil needed to be replaced, my chicken was hard and smelled like smoke. So my guess is it's hit or miss food wish but service that are doing it right. I will try again"}
{"text":"It was okay. I had high hopes. Staff was nice, hush puppies were delicious though."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru, service was fast and friendly.  The food was pretty good too.  I ordered the Perch Box for me and the Pork Chop Dinner for my husband.  Looked in hubby's box and he got three nice size chops so I stole one, how would he know the difference right?  According to the menu it looks like I have many more options to try.  And since my kids and I go to the library right around the corner every Friday after school I've got a new place to pick up dinner!"}
{"text":"I drive by the Chicken King every day and try to support my local businesses as much as I can. I recently started going to the Chicken King and I am glad I did.  The food is always made fresh to order and the quality is well above the fast food chains.  The front end staff is always friendly, smiling and engaging the staff and customers.  It's a true \"at home\" atmosphere with good food and an amazing price.  Thank you Chicken King from a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Vey good.  Went through the drive thru and got a greek salad with gyro meat.  The greek dressing was very good.  There was so much gyro meat.  Person at window friendly for sure."}
{"text":"Great food every time! I recommend the chicken Philly or the calabash shrimp. So good! And the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Quite truthfully, this place was less impressive than expected. The other reviews made it sound like this would be the chicken to end all chicken, and while it was still tasty, I wouldn't feel a particular need to specially come by to eat here.   I ordered the hand shredded chicken that this place is supposedly known for. Less salty that expected, but decent flavour and good texture. It was very filling, and I finished the entire rice box in one sitting.  It is mostly a take out joint, but there are two tables if you would like to sit and eat. The ladies there speak minimal English, and I heard them talking about me in Cantonese. That's okay though, it made me laugh.   Overall, decent price for decent food, but nothing special enough to make me stop by for a particular reason. I've had way better hand shredded chicken. I would give this place 2.5 stars, except I really do love chicken no matter how it's done, so I'm giving it a 3."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Don't let the name fool you the burgers and vegetables are excellent!"}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Got the salt and pepper flounder and calabash shrimp with a side of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes n gravy..to go. First off, the customer service alone is reason enough to go back, everyone was so friendly and inviting when I walked in.  Secondly, your food is cooked to order and you also get nice sized portions! Unfortunately, my food didn't wow me like I'd hoped. The flounder and shrimp were pretty soggy and limp (kinda like it wasnt fried long enough or maybe it was put in oil that wasn't quite hot enough yet. Not sure but I had to put it in my airfryer to crisp it up before i could eat any. My mac n cheese didnt look like any of the pics posted and was pretty bland.  Same for the potatoes so i really didnt eat either. On a brighter note, the menu is extensive and happy customers were coming and going while I was there so definitely give them try.  I'm more than willing to try something else on the menu before making a final decision. Plus the desserts looked amazing! All in all, I apprecaite the friendliness and professionalism of the staff and can't wait to give it another go. Fingers crossed!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The food is great, the service is speedy, the woman can be a bit rude; however due to the neighborhood I can understand her sour attitude. If you can by pass her attitude, the location, the view of the building, it is in fact a diamond in the rough. I love it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good cheap food then check out Chicken King. I had one of their fried chicken dinner specials that included three large pieces of chicken, fries and a salad for $7. The chicken was cooked to order so I did have to wait a bit, but it was worth it as the chicken tasted great! A lot of other stuff on their menu too like burgers, cheesesteaks, gyros and a variety of salads and sandwiches. Chicken King is a much better alternative to the Wendy's or McDonald's down the street for about the same price."}
{"text":"Wait was extremely long, but food was good. Not worth the prices though. Don't think I'd go back. Customer service was lacking as well"}
