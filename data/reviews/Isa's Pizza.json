{"text":"This place is awesome ! The staff is friendly and the food is addictive. I eat there at least 4 times a week . My favorite slices are the Nana's and the White ..if you like pizza , you must give them a try ! You will not be disappointed.THE BEST PIZZA IN THE VALLEY !!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome! Definitely my go-to lunch of choice with 2 slices of pizza and a drink for only $5!! Service is great too!"}
{"text":"As New York-style pizza goes, this place is pretty run-of-the-mill. You'll find your white, meat lovers, all that; just wish they offered a few more good toppings like goat cheese (or even feta, for that matter) and had a nicer dining room. Still, if you're looking for NY pizza done right (i.e. no out of the can mushrooms and mess like that you'll find at those cheap looking NY places in strip malls) this is the place.

I'd also like to comment on the staff, since some other dope blasted them for being dirty or whatever. I really liked these guys; there were only two on a Friday night (with a driver who was in and out), the dough-slapper and the counter guy. I really liked their rapport; it wasn't anything witty, just really homey and you could tell they were all right guys. I had a little discussion with the owner lady, and it was also pleasant.

As they might say in New York*, \"IT'S GOOD PEOPLE\"



*I am not from New York."}
{"text":"Isa's came highly recommended from a friend who knows how high my expectations when it comes to pizza have become. For as many New York implants as there are in the valley, and for as many of those many who have opened up a pie joint, Isa's gets it right, hands down. The atmosphere was classic no frills pizzeria, and made me forget I was in Phoenix for a minute, and almost swear I could hear the taxis honking like crazy outside the front door. Sam and the guys behind the counter were very personable and friendly, and helpful with a suggestion for an eggplant and ricotta slice. I also picked up a slice of cheese, as a measuring stick for Isa's versus the other places in town I have tried, and both slices were a cut above the rest (no pun intended!). I washed both slices down with a glass of orange soda (grape soda would have been the only thing better honestly), and was in heaven. This might have been my first time at Isa's, but it will definitely not be my last. I found a little slice of home far away from it, and some new friends too. Thanks Isa's, we will be seeing each other again very soon:-)..."}
{"text":"In town for business meeting and got recommendation from hotel staff for good local place. They were serious as I saw they ordered from Isa's for delivery later that afternoon. I ordered over the phone and was told 30-35 minutes for pick-up. (It was right smack in the middle of the dinner hour.) Pizza was ready and waiting when I arrived. The counterman was friendly and prompt to get me out the door.
The pizza was hot and great tasting. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find such a taste of NY in Phoenix. The ambiance was perfect pizza joint."}
{"text":"Would love to have had the opportunity to try this place but walked in a few minutes before 11 (door was unlocked) at the Bell location. I was told upon entering that they did have all the pizzas out yet and that I would need to come back at later when they were open. I ended up going down the block and had a great slice at Barro's"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of New York style pizza but this place was GREAT! The guys working behind the counter were super friendly and helped us decide on what we wanted. Will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I have traveled throughout Italy as well as New York etc..  and this is simply the best pizza I have ever had.  The Sicilian is amazing.  The staff is always personable and friendly.  I am proud to have this restaurant in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Absolutely delicious.  Only one size but it is huge.  Too much for two people, but worth having extra left over.  We had joes meatballs, fresno peppers, and onions.  It was a winner."}
{"text":"Great pizza, reminds me of back East (NY). Did not try anything crazy, went with a simple pepperoni and sausage pizza. The food was greasy like back home, but not too bad. Service reminds me of NY as well..."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and service. I love how big the slices are and the lunch special is a great deal. I will definitely come back! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and at an affordable price with top notch customer service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but it want the best is ever had.  the atmosphere was good but slightly dark.  Overall good for a pizzeria though"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian  pizza I've ever tasted !!! I highly recommend this place . I have literally eaten here for a solid week . It's addicting and so delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly both me and my wife loved the sweet chili wings, and Jamaican patty were good. We we will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Fresh made pizza with great ingredients.  This place is the best pizza in Phoenix hands down.  I work just a little north of this place and have introduced it to all of my coworkers and they all agree with my boast.  They have a very good lunch special every day.  You have to try the Nana's Pizza as the sweet plum sauce on it is fantastic.  I am a regular here and will continue to be for as long as I can.  Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"We LOVE Isa's!  It's a quick, scrumptious (economical) bite!  We commonly get the slices...the white pizza, the fresh tomato sprinkled with basil, the Sicilian, the sausage, the supreme, the Alfredo spinach...it's all mouth watering.  The Cesar salad is a delicious addition too.  What really makes it a sweet spot is the people!  The lady who owns the place greets our little one with smiles every visit and even introduced her to her first cannoli.  The pizza cook is truly our favorite though.  He does what he does but it's a mini-show to us and he is inevitably there every time we go.  Everyone should have \"their\" pizza place.  This is ours."}
{"text":"Ok excellent pizza--but this place is grungy. I thought it was a one time thing but I have been there several times-the pizza is excellent. The aprons and t-shirts on the guys making pizza were filthy, not oops I have sauce on me but I haven't washed my clothes for a week. Fine in a trash guy but not someone prepping food. Germs and food poisoning happen because the food handlers are sloppy. I'll be back when I see clean looking food handlers."}
{"text":"Writing this as I wait in the car for my pizza. When you say 20-25 minutes, don't take 35. Your pizza is good, but not worth-waiting-in-my-car-for good.....

***

That was my first review - and I generously rated them 3 stars. I must now update my review and it's not only based on the wait (which turned out to be 40 minutes) but also the owner and under-seasoned, undercooked pizza. I wasn't going to update my review, but you'll understand why if you continue reading. Before I left Isa's, I had interacted with two people (one of which was apparently the owner) and I said, \"You know, an apology would be nice. I was quoted 20-25 minutes on the phone and it's now been 40.\" The owner gave me a reluctant apology. 

Fast forward two hours later and I receive a voicemail from the owner. I called back, not knowing this was the woman I had already dealt with, and she began yelling at me. She insisted that she checked the receipt and the pizza was \"only three minutes late and I yelled at her in front of other customers - who were appalled by my behavior.\" First, I didn't yell. Second, no... I called at 5:24 p.m. I was told 20-25 minutes. I showed up at 5:50 p.m. Quick math, that's 26 minutes. The cashier said \"it's going to be another 8 minutes on that pie.\" It was at that point that I checked my watch and noted that the pizza would be approximately 9 minutes late. I came back in, 8 minutes later, and the pizza was still not done. A completely reasonable reason to leave a business a 3 star review. I'm still in complete shock over the childish and outrageous conduct I just experienced. I also learned today that their 40th St. and Bell location has gone out of business. I am not surprised whatsoever."}
{"text":"The pizza is freakin  awesome. Some of the best I have had in a very long time. Perfectly crispy crust and everything had lots of flavor. They didn't have wings available yet since we walked in just as they were opening but it just makes something to look forward to next time. The service was great all the employees were so friendly. The only reason this place didn't get five stars was because of the meatball sandwich, it was probably the worst I've had but the rest of the food more than made up for that we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Growing up in New Jersey, I know what is good pizza. This place does East Coast pizza perfectly. Great lunch special 2 slices and brink $5.00. The staff are very friendly. Only down size is  menu items are a little too pricey, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had! The only down side is that it's kinda greasy but otherwise it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza joint. Their pizza comes in one size; 18\". It is great NY style pizza with many varieties. The business is family run and they do so much for the area schools. Really good pizza at really great prices."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service.  This is an excellent example of a locally-owned family restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Nana's Pie and the Supreme are at the top of my list. Definitely two thumbs up. 
Support your local businesses"}
{"text":"So very disappointed!  They used to have great pizza. There was hardly any cheese or sauce on it. Pretty bad when Little Caesars hot n ready pizza is better.  When I went to pay there was only one person working the register and he was on the phone so long that the pizza was sitting on the counter getting cold. I finally put money on the counter and left."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews this is one of the best if not the best pizza's I've ever had !! Got the Nana's with sausage & pepperoni. The sauce was incredible the toppings deli fresh the crust crispy on the outside chewy in the middle, awesome pie. The sevice was also great, called in a to go order after getting a 20% off coupon in the mail thought hey lets give it a try. Placed the order got the typical as I thought canned response of  \"it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes\" I've heard this so many times and 30 -40 minutes later I'm still waiting at the counter for my pie. But not here Joe was pulling it out of the oven when I walked in 15 minutes after placing the order what more can you ask for ? Don't wait 2-3hours to get in for one of the boutique pies in town try Isa's you'll love it we sure did!!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I discovered Isa's a week ago and have been back three times since! The staff is always friendly and remembers us. And you couldn't ask for a more authentic New York style pizza. Delicious every time."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok.  Not bad, but not great - just not a lot of flavor.  Tried a slice of the spinach alfredo and a slice of the white.  I think that I just prefer a different style of pizza.

When I went, they had a couple of new employees that had been there about a week.  It took a while to get my order (which I had called in ahead) because the new guys were trying to figure out the system and kept jumping from one order/customer to another without completing the first.  The result was a lot of people standing around waiting to order or waiting for one item, etc.  This will probably get better as the new guys learn the system."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas for delivery and was told 30 minutes. They arrived perfectly on time and both were great. Ordered a veggie pizza and a pepperoni and sausage for a group of people in preparation for fight night. Everyone loved the pizza and the party was a success. For sure one of the best pizzas in town. I'm thankful I live close."}
{"text":"Small place but great food. Pizza sauce and cheese taste very fresh. The staff seem as if they like their job there. Very nice and attentive. They have lunch options with salad that I have tried out as well. Salad is good but nothing to brag on....but the pizza is!  I only wish the place was a little bigger. When it gets busy, that many people in a small space, I get to feel kind of claustrophobic. I try to avoid that by going on semi-off hours. It is the only reason I gave four stars. The pizza is FIVE stars!"}
{"text":"Authentic New York style pizza, both in taste and presentation.  Good deal for 2 slices and a drink."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Don't get me wrong the pizza was good but the guy behind the counter was maybe the BIGGEST jerk I have ever come across.

I walked in and saw that they only had pizzas out with slice taken from them and since I had never been here before wasn't sure if they sold whole pizzas or not. So  I asked the guy behind the counter and he said very rudely, \"obviously, this IS a pizza place.\" And while it may have been a stupid question, you should never ever talk to a customer like that! Day 1 customer service rules. 

I work in the hair industry and deal with people all day long and would never start a sentence with 'obviously' if they asked me a question! Stupid or not! 

 I ordered a pizza only because I had just got off work and was so tired and was having company over. But I really wish I would have just walked out. Then he proceeds to stare at me and tell me that 'my shirt is intense' after he already knew he pissed me off. Unbelievable!

He had a Charr shirt on so obviously works at there multiple restaurants.  But to whoever is managing these places I would not have him working for me if that's how he treats customers. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Must try! Fun staff - great singers! Joey makes a mean pie! Nana's my fav! I want 4 slices :)"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meat lovers' pizza & it was just amazing. Highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"Okay, for starters the music as I entered was heavy metallic to the point that it was hard to think.  I had an open mind, being from the east coast knowing that I need to be more forgiving and open minded.   First, as it is all over AZ, they call mootz , CHEESE. Totally clueless.  They only have one size - not good. I asked that my pizza be well done - it was not. The pizza dough itself was dry and not any better than pillsbury. The sauce okay, nothing special.  They loaded it with so much \" cheese\" that it fell apart when I got home.
The place itself is immaculate but beware, a great pizza joint doesn't serve a lot of other items on the menu such as subs etc. I'm giving up trying.
If you are not fussy or have never had east coast pizza then this place will be okay for you."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that people find this to be exceptional pizza. I am hardly a harsh critic of food, instead I'm normally one who finds something I like about most everything I eat. I can't say there is anything I like about this pizza. It was really bad. I've waited an hour before writing this to prevent being emotional about the review. I threw 3/4 of the pizza away. The crust is bad. Cheese was lacking. Sausage was horrendous....awful taste and akin to a salt lick. I would recommend going just a few blocks away to Spinatos if you'd like a quality pie. Johnnys is also close by. Dominos new recipe is better. NYPD is far better. Just save your $25 bucks for a one topping pizza(with $4 tip for the teenager who delivered...not his fault) and go somewhere good. Heck, i'd much rather a Jacks frozen pizza...no joke. Ok, back to being sick on the sofa. Ugh!"}
{"text":"We ordered Isa's 18\" pizza with two toppings for pick-up.  When we got it home, I grabbed for a slice, put it on my plate, and found my fingertips black with soot.  I put the pizza back  in the box and immediately returned it for a full refund.

Our pizza looked as though it was dragged along the bottom of a dirty fireplace.  Isa's isn't the only Phoenix pizzeria guilty of this, but this is the worst instance of a sooty bottomed pizza I've had in Phoenix. 

The 2nd star is for the staff, who very efficiently and apologetically handled our refund.  However, despite the staff's handling of the situation, I strongly urge you to consider a different pizzeria."}
{"text":"We spent almost $30 on an 18\" supreme pizza. The prices are a little high for the quality. The peppers on the pizza were soggy and overdone, there were only about six pepperoni slices on the entire pizza and the mushrooms did not taste fresh. We have had their calzone three times and it was delicious, a little too much ricotta for me but none the less delicious! The salad bar always looks old and never clean, to say the least ..if you catch them on a good day its good but on a consistent level its not fantastic!"}
{"text":"I used to have to drive over to the 7th and Thunderbird location for my fix of cheese and anchovy pizza, but now Isa's is in my backyard!!!!!  It's my go to lunch spot at least a couple of times a week.  All the pizza's look great but I'm a sucker for my two slices of cheese and anchovy plus drink.  Quality is terrific and the lunch special price is right on the mark,  So if your tired of a hamburger hot dog or anything else for that matter stop by and give it a try you will not be disappointed in this great slice of heaven.  And if your a little daring, try the anchovies!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  This is hands down the best pizza joint in the valley, and it's not even close.  I love this place.  Real deal authentic NY style pizza.  I usually get a large pizza with various toppings, but this time I decided to go with the white pizza and it was amazing.  I think what separates this place from other pizza joints, is their quality ingredients.  The cheese is the best and the meats and vegetables are fresh and top quality.  I used to order Spinato's and Rosati's, but this place is so much better.  They also have a great lunch special, two pieces of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks, you can't beat that.  Since I live so close, I always order it to go and I am always impressed.  They are very friendly over the phone and when they greet you.  The employees are always smiling and you can tell they enjoy what they do.  I'm in love with this place.  If you want top notch pizza, come to Isa's, you wont be disappointed.

I highly recommend this place.  They have outstanding pizza and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"We have been living in the area about a year now and this is by far the best pizza and wings we found. Make sure you get the wings extra crispy. This is definitely a winner and I grew up in new jersey!"}
{"text":"Love Isa! Great pizza and you can get the whole pie or just a couple of slices. Reasonable and tasty! A great stop on my way home if I don't want to make dinner. By the slice availability is nice as it allows a variety. Only complaint is that it is very hot in there - the pizza ovens are HOT! I feel bad for the employees! Nice family and tasty food. A win for us!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place!!! Love the sauce and they always put enough CHEESE on the pie! They have a great variety to choose from!"}
{"text":"I had been pondering dropping by here or Aiello's for a while.  I made it in today (Sunday) because Paradise Burger Company was closed.

The cashier and cook both seem extremely hard working.  They were quite busy, but always kept moving.  The cook mentioned that two people didn't show up to work today, and the poor cashier girl had to run out and make a delivery even!  I appreciated the large cup the cashier gave me for water.

Sadly, the food didn't blow me away.  The sandwich was smaller than I expected for $9.  Granted, I declined the side salad it came with, which was a $4 value.  The bread had a decent chew but was bland.  It was untoasted with no butter or olive oil brushed on it.  The veal/pork meatballs themselves were the biggest disappointment, as they were the blandest I have ever had from an Italian restaurant in my recent memory.  A thorough dousing with the pepper, cheese, garlic, and oregano on the table helped perk it up, but I shouldn't have had to do so.  Maybe their clientele prefers it more mild?  They were nicely moist with a nice soft texture.

The Oreo cheesecake was a little too gelatinous and soft for my taste, (I like it very firm) but the flavor profile was solid.  Very Oreo-y.

Their napkins are extraordinarily thin and cheap, so I had an embarrassing large pile of used ones after...

Why 4 stars?  The cook is really awesome, and their customer service was incredible.  I will have to come again and try something else."}
{"text":"Love this place and the owners! Have tried all their varieties of pies by the slice and they are all very delicious. My favorites are Nana's, Spinach Alfredo, and the Pepperoni, but you can't go wrong with anything you order.  And save room for dessert, the Tiramisu is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Driving by and saw their lunch special two slices and a drink for five bucks pretty good deal I had a cheese slice and a white pizza slice both were okay I like the White Slice better nice and garlicky only thing I didn't care for was the dough it was very dry no moisture at all almost like eating a soft thick cracker need a lot of water in to get it down overall was okay I might go back not sure"}
{"text":"Love this pizza joint. A good friend of mines who is from new York & knows his pizza showed me this gem. I instantly fell in love with the place. First their two slices & a drink for $5 is a steal! You can order by the slice & they will warm up your pieces of choice. I went with a slice of the white pizza & the meat lovers. The crust on these slices were perfectly charred & the perfect crunch every bite. Real simple but great ingredients. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've had on the north side. I really like that they sell by the slice and it's like $3 a slice which is reasonable. The slices and pretty large so it's a good deal. I got the Nana's and the spinach alfredo and I would definitely recommend them! My roommate got the white pizza and she said the ricotta was out of this world. This place will be my new go to for pizza hands down."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Always flavorful with a great crust! Great for lunch, especially $5.00 for two HUGE slices and a soda! Very authentic NY style pizza. This is absolutely one of the best pizza joints in Phoenix!

They also deliver to a really wide delivery area! The best part? The really reasonable prices! You can easily feed a family of 4 for $25! Salut, Isa's Pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! This is my new favorite pizza. By the slice or whole pies it is a good deal. The pizzas are very big and have the correct amount of toppings and cheese. Crust tastes amazing and is slightly crunchy. The sauce is the best pizza sauce I have ever had. A little sweet and bursting with tomato flavor. Try a specialty pizza, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic! But the delivery guy was covered in scabs and shaking like he had parkinsons. As an RN who works on a lock down psych unit, I can only assume he is a meth addict as I have seen many and he def fit the bill. Just my impression. Scares me to think he might have had a hand in making the pie though. Unfortunate, as the pizza is wonderful but after seeing that would hesitate to order again."}
{"text":"If you like NY style pizza you will like this pizzeria. If you like that deep dish or sweet sauce crap keep looking. As far as NY style pizza is concerned they hit the mark. One of the best in the area. We usually take out so I can't comment on the service. One of our go to when we need our pizza fix."}
{"text":"the pizza is good, However the place is not very sanitary, do not eat pizza by the slice, they let flies land on the pizza before they server it to you.."}
{"text":"This place was crazy deceptive.  When we walked in we were really apprehensive but holy crap the pizza was amazing. Since we moved to PHX we have been looking for a really good pizza place and this place is it!"}
{"text":"a true gem . amazing super fresh ny style
pizza . wings are the best i've had def try their sweet chili wings is a must ! worth every dollar at this spot !"}
{"text":"Isa's Pizza is a hidden gem!  The best NY pizza in AZ.  It's like a flashback  to Brooklyn, NY.  The aroma of garlic & sauce hits you immediately.  The garlic knots & pinwheels are outstanding!  The pizza is simply delicious, great crust, cheese nice & stretchy and just the right amount of sauce which allows you to fold the slice!  So yummy!!!   The staff is very friendly & accommodating.  Pizza by the slice or whole pies, anyway you like it.  By far the best pizza I've eaten.   Nana's pizza is a must try!   Do yourself a big favor and stop by for a slice of heaven.  I've been there 3 times in one week.  Joe is the best pizza maker and very friendly."}
{"text":"Went today to this establishment and what a deception, what a let down.  Dont get me wrong the $5 for 2 slices and drink special is not bad, but the employees working there seem to be just anybody from the street.  The soonest I sat down to have the meal, they started talking really loud along with a visitor using profanity after profanity.  They didn't care there were paying customers inside trying to enjoy their meal.  They seem oblivious of having a good customer impression.  The cook kept using profanity along with the waitresses/cashiers there.  Left there is a bad taste of mouth and spirit.  I really wanted to like the place because it seem like good addition to the neighborhood ; but was sadly disappointing, what a shame..!  Hopefully the owner would read this, so he or she can correct such simple problem"}
{"text":"This used to be a go-to for us, as I am a native of NJ, but it has been so hit or miss in the last couple years that we don't even bother anymore. The quality of their food has gone down significantly and the service is just flat-out bad. Joe means well and is a terrific guy, but it seems as though he's taken his foot off the pedal and doesn't care as much anymore. The food used to be some of the best Italian in the Valley, but now it's truly mediocre at best. As alluded to above, the service is just bad and ill-suited for their roles. Not rude necessarily, just clueless and clearly not putting forth effort to exude confidence in the customer. My rating would have been 4 or 5 stars a few years ago, but now it was all I could do to not give Joe & co. a 1-star rating. I wish Joe would get back in the kitchen again and hire competent help."}
{"text":"OK yous guys, dis pizza is da real deal.  I oughta know, I'm a genuine Noo Yawka.  It's da same pizza I use ta get back on Long Island.  I also got a friend that loves it too.  She says it's exactly da same as what she got at her local pizza place in Farmingdale.  At last, some real Sicilian slices!"}
{"text":"I found the place a bit confusing when I first walked in as there are two entrances, one that appears to be for a restaurant setup and the other the Pizzeria. So I stood at the wrong counter for about 5 mins until someone came over to correct my error. 

Now this is just me, but I finally came to realize that I don not like NY style pizza.  I've had it several times at other establishments and now I know its not what I like.  It was good, the slices where substantial, but its not my thing.

If you do like NY style pizza I would assume that you would enjoy Isa's."}
{"text":"Isa's is great! The \"Nana's sauce\" is sweet and delicious. Every time I go in there they are so nice to me. I have a twin and she is the one who told me about the place. She goes there almost daily so I feel like a bit of a celebrity when I arrive. They also have a sister restaurant, Aiellos, on Thunderbird and cave Creek. That's delicious too!"}
{"text":"I think one of my pizzas was $35...  I'd like to think the person taking my order was polite and thankful I decided to spend a total of $50 at their pizza parlor... But no. He was rude and short... Unreal. When I walked in the man was sitting on the counter... Yes the counter and with his cell phone in hand... didn't bother to even look up. Probably the last time I spend that kind of money with Isa's again... Thanks guy."}
{"text":"Isa's pizza has really good new york style pizza. They have both whole pizzas and pizza by the slice. They also have lunch specials. The garlic knots are also good. The staff is friendly and nice. I highly recommend  this local pizza place for yummy ny style pizza."}
{"text":"Isa's pizza is on the SE corner of 7th st and t bird and shares a spot with Aiello Salumeria.  There are several pastas, salads, heros, and other items to order.  You order at the counter and have a seat.  The place is set up rather awkward.  There is a tiny area in the back of the pizza side with tables to eat at.  Then there are a few small tables on the deli side that are out in the open.  We chose to eat on the deli side as it felt claustrophobic on the pizza side.

You can order pizza by the slice or by the pie.  Unfortunately, there is only one size to choose from and it is massive and over 20 bucks.  The pizza by the slice was sitting out and didn't look fresh so we opted for a whole pie.  We also ordered a caprese salad and a couple drinks.  

The salad was tasty and came with a chunk of mozzarella, red peppers, artichokes, salami, prosciutto, lettuce, olives, balsamic vinegar and tomatoes.  It had some great flavors but should have been bigger for 9 bucks and some of the peppers could have been cut into smaller pieces.

The pizza came out next and looked and smelled amazing.  We ordered the Nanas special.  It came with mozzarella, basil, and a sweet tomato sauce that was drizzled back and forth over the top.  It was absolutely delicious.  The toppings complimented each other extremely well.  The crust was crisp on the bottom and chewy in the center.  This was not your everyday pizza.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The mozzarella stood out and the sauce balanced them together.  We really loved the pizza most of all and look forward to trying another soon.

Isa's is definitely worth checking out and has the potential to be great.  A few things would help that happen would be to rearrange the dining area, make a few size options for the pizza, and increase the portion of salad.  That said the pizza was delish and I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Great pizza like back east.   First one I have found out here in years.  Grew up in Detroit. Chicago and Indy.  Way better.  I will only go here now.  

Thx dan"}
{"text":"These guys have some really good Pizza and it is relatively close to la casa. Saw them one day while eating at PV Burgers and have been coming back ever since.

This location has been so many different restaurants over the years. What they have now is some very nice 18\" NY Pizza. You can go NY thin crust or try out their Sicilian style. They also have Salads, Heroes, Macaroni, Calzones, Stromboli and more.

Ordered their excellent lunch special on my first visit. It was two slices of cheese and a soda for a crisp fin ($5). You can also choose from several different pizzas in the display case or take some cheese and add your own toppings per request. Very quick and a tasty treat.

They also have delivery. This is always great when it is a Friday or Saturday night and the St Pauli Girls are going down rather easily. Just call them up and it arrives with no or little effort at all. You will want to make sure and order early or ahead of time since they close at 8 o'clock.

Service is friendly and the quality of the pizza is fantastic. Everything is always fresh and the pizza can be warmed up later if you have leftovers. We are talking 18\" of pure delight and we normally alway get a couple meals between the two of us.

Just need an excuse to order some more pizza. Granddaughter does enjoy chewing on the crust. She is teething at the moment. Anybody ready for a Supreme Pizza? DING DONG!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to give this place a try, I mean is a pizza place in a strip mall with a huge banner sign that says $5.00 lunch special. I am glad I looked past all that because this is the best NYC style pizza in Phoenix. Great ingredients, sauce is tasty, and the crust is perfect thanks for a brick oven that somebody in the back knows how to use. Best part, and I kid you not, what they had Bon Jovi \"Wanted Dead of Alive\" on the radio. I closed my eyes and was transported back to NJ for a brief moment. F'get about it. These pisanos can cook."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Good prices.  They have a great selection of pizzas to choose from and all are great.  Friendly service.  When combined with the options you can get from Aiello's next door, it's the perfect place for a simple but well done Italian meal that makes you feel welcome"}
{"text":"Love the pizza just not when it's burnt  still giving 4 stars for how great the pizza is when it's not burnt.. Too bad a pizza is almost $20 it's ridiculously overpriced but the only decent option in the area"}
{"text":"Overpriced, undercooked lack of hygiene. 

Purchased a salad two drinks a single slice of pizza and a meatball hero for $27! I thought to myself this is going to be some damn good food for that price. 

Sadly, the pizza was rock hard reheated after sitting out for who knows how long and didn't have any pepperoni on it as ordered and charged. Just cheese. The meet ball hero was even worse, frozen center yum! Salad was bland at best.

The cook was multitasking and touching his hands over doors and non cookware equipment then right back to food handling. We decided to Return the food and leave.

I've had their pizza before and it was solid in the past, but the cooks and staff couldn't care less and will be the downfall of this place, which is too bad. I always enjoy supporting local non-chain restaurants, but i def won't be back."}
{"text":"Well finally had the chance to try this place. They were open on Labor Day when my go to place Crust was closed. I was not impressed. We ordered a chicken ps sub, meatball sub, large pizza and the last 5 garlic knots.  The worse part was the meatballs. OMG they tasted fake. The pizza was ok, but a too much seasoning for my taste. Probably won't go again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood, old school, nothing fancy New York style pizza joint.  Nana's Pie is my favorite and a slice I look forward to eating.  Wings are good, all the other pizzas we have tried are good and the spaghetti and meatballs are fantastic."}
{"text":"I was super impressed by the pizza. Real NY pizza in Phoenix, not \"like NY\" pizza. Growing up on Long Island and having the best pizza in the world I was shocked to find this place. I will be as frequent a customer as I can be. Great job!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service at this 2nd location (original on 7th st). The $5 lunch special for 2 slices and a soda can not be beat! Special thanks to Nancy and Eric for their friendly and superb service!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!! New York style pizza available by the slice with a variety of toppings make for a great meal. Slices are thin and topped with generous ingredients. Ordered a Sicilian cheese pizza which was HUGE. I am also a fan of the Nanas style pie. They also serve wings, salads, and pasta. My new go to spot for New York style pies."}
{"text":"Really good NY pizza.  Lunch special for $5 is a deal for the quality of the food.  2 big slices and a soda.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite and were very pleased with everything.  Seven of with different tastes in pizza and all were happy with the flavor and quality. My son-in-law's mother opted for a salad rather than 2 slices and she was happy with her salad.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"When I lived in moon valley I frequented this delicious pizza joint often. I eventually moved to paradise valley but still find myself driving back to moon valley to enjoy the best pie in the valley. My personal favorite is the sweet marinara with fresh basil. Close your eyes and you're in Italy. Definitely the best in the valley maybe even the county..."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent, especially the eggplant slices. I would have given 5 stars for the pizza but the place needs a serious makeover. The tables and floors are not the cleanest and could use some TLC. If you don't mind that they you will love this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Seriously one of the best New York style pizzas I've eaten in AZ."}
{"text":"Nothing makes this pizza stand out. Very bland and bad customer service. There are two entrances an it looks like two separate restaurants but it isn't. These guys also own char. I've seen many restaurants come to this location to die. Good luck boys"}
{"text":"So I've been to both the 7th Street and 40th Street location.  Both have the same problems.  This place wouldn't know how to keep a clean restaurant if it killed them. The place is dirty - always. One time I went there at 11:20 am, well before the lunch rush and the place was a mess. Crap on the floor, no straws, very few drink lids, dirty tables, the soda machine has seen better days.  It shouldn't be this dirty so early in the day!

Oh yes and they will touch your money or cards and then touch your food.  I saw a guy literally place the whole side of his thumb on another woman's slices as he handed it to her.  I know I'm a bit of a germ phobe.  Seriously guys - get some tongs or some utensils to fix this or maybe just have a dedicated cashier who doesn't touch the food.  There is just a serious lack of hygiene and cleanliness at these restaurants and one day someone will get sick from it.

The pizza is just ok, same with the caesar salad. Most of the time they seem out of pepperoni pizza. How can this be?  This should be a pizza that is constantly being made so it is available.  One time I got the lunch special of two slices and the pizza had just come out of the oven. When I got home and pulled it out, I realized it had been taken out of the oven too early and wasn't fully cooked (dough).  It wasn't even any shade of brown color.

I called and complained to management, but they just sorta blew it off after offering to deliver me 2 more slices (this was takeout order). Out of desperation I accepted. They said it would be to me in 10 minutes, it took a little over 22 minutes.

I keep going back hoping things improve and they don't, so I'm done.  I just wish there was a decent pizza place for slices and salads in north Phoenix.

Oh well......................"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Phoenix.  PERIOD.  If you like NY style pizza, this is Da Place.  Get the Sicilian or Grammas.   Over the top delicious!  No words.  Man... just writing about this is making me want more."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, great crust. Try the white options. Was out the door for $6.50 for two speciality slices and a drink."}
{"text":"The Best pizza in the valley, my daughter want to add mushrooms to her spinach white pizza slice and she loved it!!! For a 10 year old to love it.... it's a hit!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while and we finally got there yesterday. We ordered a variety for takeout so we could try lots of items. I especially like that they have 1 size pizza (indication to me that it would be good). New York style-we got pepperoni, onion, and basil. Delicious-we will definitely call ahead and puck up again. Had a sausage calzone which was tasty-just the right amount of everything. Got the baked Ziti which came with a nice little side salad. Simple greens with a few tiny tomatoes. Nothing special but it was fresh.  Nice touch that they have fresh Parmesan. Will definitely head back. I'd give it a 5 if the salad was a little more substantial. Glad this place is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great pizza! My customers that I fed today were very impressed! Reasonable prices and service was fast. My pizza was put in the oven later as requested, so it would be nice and hot when I picked it up. 
The floor was greasy feeling which goes right in line with the pizzas dripping grease. It was a little much, but I did order meat lovers, so maybe that's a given. Overall excellent experience, and my customers were happy, which is the most important part for me. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in NY: Brooklyn, Bronx... I'm 100% traditional Italian. It take A LOT to impress me! I moved out to the Phoenix area in 2005 and I've been searching for the best Italian food places in the valley. My quest is a long and continuing journey of extreme disappointment. I'm a snob because when you have had the best it's hard to eat anything less.

Isa's is the REAL deal!!! This is the best NY style pizza you are going to find out here. When I walk in it feels like home. Everything on the menu is excellent using only fresh ingredients. Thin pizza you can fold in half to eat!!!

I am there a couple times a month since finding this place. Joey is the real deal as well. He cooks the best pizza and the Sicilian is AMAZING!! Him and the rest of the staff are courteous, friendly, and make you feel like you are family!! I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Go here!! You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Wow the tiramisu , cannoils  and cream puffs are legit 
Will be back! The real deal"}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting sauce around.......Nana's Pie is a personal fave, but we trump it up with pepperoni usually :-)
Great wings from next door - and the best part, they deliver.
Calzones are killer too!"}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza in town?  No, but it is better than average and close to our house.  Friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Chose here over some others because they deliver. Price was reasonable, delivery was timely, and pizza was delicious!! Will be ordering again from here."}
{"text":"Great pizza! They only offer one size, which is often too much, but the leftovers are great. Their tortellini is to die for, you should definitely try it! A little pricey compared to most pizza places, but food is wonderful."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!! Stopped by Sunday night to avoid the Point and their outrageous prices. We yelped pizza and decided to come check it out. Out-F'ing-standing.
I had 2 slices of the spinach and cheese and this was the first pizza that EVER has melted in my mouth, HOLY CRAP it was delicious. My daughter had the white pizza (they made special for her) and again, her eyes lit up with her first bite. 
The owner came out and chatted with the kids and the staff was super friendly coming in, during and on the way out.  I'm sad I live in Gilbert, so I won't be able to frequent this place as often as I would like, I would make this our GO TO pizza place if we lived closer.
A MUST STOP!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here yesterday with a friend. The lunch special is two slices of cheese (extra for toppings)and a fountain drink for  $5! You really can't beat that. The slices are huge so my friend and I actually split the meal and added another drink and still ate lunch for less than $7! Not only that, but we both really enjoyed our slice.  I highly recommend, and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight. A bit of a drive from Cave Creek...... But oh so worth it!! Finally I got East coast pizza in Arizona. Being from Maryland it is hard to find Pizza, my husband had the sausage and pepper sub, which he moaned the entire time how good it was! We have already told our son and grandson we ate taking them there for real pizza:) great place , clean . A must try. Many types of pizza are ready to buy by the slice. See you there."}
{"text":"Yummy! I stopped in after a doctor appointment and was really impressed! 
I am really allergic to red sauce and so I really have to be careful when ordering pizza. They had a delicious spinach Alfredo
pizza with a white sauce!
Tasted amazing and was really filling! Nice people and good service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The one on 7th ST. and Thunderbird has the best cook ever!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Isa's after work one night around 7:30 PM because I was starving and craving pizza. The guy at the sno cone place right by there had advised me to try it a few days before, mentioning that they have a great lunch special. I am so glad I listened to him. The place only had a family of 3 when I came in this late at night and there were only a couple pizzas to choose from, but I'm not picky. Granted it was almost time to close for them. I decided to get two slices: the specialty and white pizza. After a quick warming up in the oven, I took my slices to go. They were so stinking delicious. I have continued to have cravings for Isa's since that trip a few days ago and I can't wait to go back. Probably for the lunch special next time. I definitely could have gotten away with just one slice, but I will most likely still get two and just save one slice for later next time because the pizza is so amazing. I also heard the lady with her two kids who ordered before me ask if they could have some garlic knots, but the employee said they didn't have any. I'll definitely have to try those in the future. Basically, this is probably the cheapest price for the best quality pizza in the area. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Nothing worse than watching a great place go down hill. I have held off writing this review but tonight finally frustrated me over the ledge.  I called for our typical Friday night pizza. First call I am hung up on. Second call, someone answers \"hello\" I say \"I would like to order a pizza\" click, hung up on again. Third call, someone actually speaks. I order the usual, pizza, salad  and wings (over course they are out of wings as usual). I am told \"there are 2 deliveries in front of you so either you can come pick it up or we can't help you\". It's 7:30 on a Friday. Yikes. 

Here is the deal. I love the pizza here. No doubt some of the best in Phoenix. However, this place is run super poorly. Stock the food on the menu, teach people how to answer a phone, and hire another delivery person. Otherwise, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. My new \"go to\" for lunch. It's fast, delicious, and cheap. 

Very authentic ny style pizza. I've been going once a week lately and I'm slightly addicted. 

Do not miss..."}
{"text":"Awful, flavorless pizza. Meatballs are mush. One of our pizzas was burnt on the bottom and wasn't cut at all."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in town.  This was a throwback to old town pizzeria and it's delicious.   Joe is engaging and it's fun to see him. We tried other places,  and this is the best.   Coming from a pizza snob,  this review is from my heart... and my palate!"}
{"text":"Been to Isa's twice now. Both visits I've had great customer service, by one 20 year old-ish man behind the counter. He seems to have a great attitude and remembered us at our second visit. They have a great variety of pizza slices including Buffalo chicken, spinach Alfredo & my favorite Sicilian. Glad to have Isa's near home!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent New York style pizza. The crust was really good and crispy! We tried the sausage, which is okay if you like sliced Italian sausage (not crumbled). We also tried the garlic knots which were okay, very garlicky, not sure if I would get them again."}
{"text":"Fantastic..... Great spinach pizza.    Real pizza.    Great lunch special and a lot to choose from.    Highly recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place......It's hard to find pizza in Phoenix like I always had growing up in the Northeast, but you can find it here at a reasonable price!!   Also, try the cannoli's......they are so good!"}
{"text":"Yummy! This pizza is amazing...... You can't beat the lunch special. I would recommend trying the all white pizza with mozzarella and ricotta. Delicious!!!! The owner and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Busy during lunch but worth the wait. Antipasto Salad is delicious. Pizza sizes are huge. They have deals for lunch. 1 slice of pizza is $2.98 and they have another deal 2 slices and a drink for $6.50. You have to try the garlic knots too they are $.50"}
{"text":"Lovely price on their lunch special for an amazing two slices. Best pizza on this side of town."}
{"text":"I came to this place expecting great tasting New York style pizza. Once I was finished eating, I felt satisfied and I got what I was hoping for. The price point is very on point and there is nothing apocryphal about this pizza. This blows Famous Rays out of the water. The only negative portion of my experience was the salad. I ordered my food to go and they doused my salad with Cesar dressing. I would recommend placing their dressing on the side for to go salad orders. This is nothing to upbraid them for but it is a coachable opportunity. Overall it was a good experience and real good pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Crust is nice and crisp but slices are still fold-able. Great toppings to choose from and at $2.50/slice beyond reasonable! Lunch special: $2 slices and a drink for $5 and they're quick!
 
I like the sauce but can't wait to order a white pizza!! 

I'm not a huge fan of the alfredo slice -- don't get me wrong: it definitely tastes like alfredo, but that's just not my thing. Maybe if they made it more of a carbonara (i.e. add bacon or ham)! 

REALLY glad to have them in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed East Coast pizza snob I will stop and inquire when I see something advertised as NY Pizza. Recently we ordered this for work and I can confirm that it is the read deal. Decent pizza decent price-you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat. They have some of the best pies in the valley. The bartender at the place next door is a fox also. Don't let this hidden gem pass you by."}
{"text":"We tried Isa's on a week night when there was nothing left in the house and Mama was way too tired to cook.  I saw the restaurant on 40th and Bell and wondered how good it could be.  Well...it rocks!  It has been a while since I have enjoyed a true New York pizza place in Phoenix.  We have been to other places and they were good, but this place takes it up a notch.  We tried a pepperoni and extra cheese and eggplant with ricotta.  The crust is thin at the center and nice and fluffy at the outer crust.  Nice.  Also, the crust and sauce was not too sweet. We have encountered that at several places.  Sweet sauce? Yuck!  While some NY style pizza can be overly greasy, not so with Isa's.  The pepperoni and extra cheese was really yummy.  My kids downed a whole pizza themselves.  I personally loved the eggplant and ricotta.  It had thin slices of oven roasted eggplant, mozzarella and lovely dollops of ricotta.  A nice change.  I make my own vegetarian pizza that is fantastic.  This pizza could compete with mine.  The delivery was a little slow and the cost was a little pricey, however, I am tired of bad pizza.  In fact, I don't eat pizza unless I think it will be good.  Call me a pizza snob, but I believe life is too short for bad pizza, cheap ice cream. and stinky wine."}
{"text":"Molto bene! Love being able to get pizza by the slice.  In my opinion, the crust is perfect. The slices are large, so the $5.00 lunch special is a very good deal. My fave is their version of the margherita with plum tomatoes and basil...."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ over 10 years and this is the best pizza I've ever had here. And I'm from New York!Great food, clean place and awesome service.  My only regret is I'm gonna gain 10 pounds if I'm not careful. Ok I'll just exercise more. It's worth it! Give this place a try and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We've come here several times.  I love the pizza and the food is very good...especially for the price.  However, my husband and I are almost throwing in the towel on this place as the hygiene/cleanliness of the restaurant leaves much to be desired.  The tile feels oily and gross, and the establishment needs some major TLC and deep cleaning.  With the restaurants overall  lack of cleanliness it starts to make you question food preparation, etc.  Also frustrating as we waited over a half hour for wings and were completely done with our meal when they arrived.  If you can get past the cleanliness/hygiene the food really is quite good.  Disappointing though as with a little TLC it could be a great pizza by the slice restaurant.   

My first time visit:


Great pizza for the price, we will definitely be coming here on a more frequent basis.  $5.00 for two slices of Huge New York Pizza with a drink, it's got my vote!  The Greek salad was also good, I love pizza by the slice and my family of three was all able to order what they liked."}
{"text":"Update: 11/7...

Finally got in touch with the manager (Joe). If you have a run-in with this \"tough guy\", know that he's going to yell scream and stand by his employees. Ex.) He threatened to \"kill me\" because he didn't like what I said (or wrote on here). If you choose to still give this place your business, good luck. The nail's in the coffin (for this place) as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New York City. 
Since I found Isa's Pizza, it is my go to place for Pizza. Nothing compares so anytime I feel like Pizza, it has to be Isa's. It's the next best thing to having Pizza in NY."}
{"text":"Four adults, one really big pizza loaded with meats = yum!  Be advised - the garlic knot are fist size (we ordered way too many).  Service was friendly and prompt.  The pizza was great.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So good. If you want plain pizza or creative and super flavorful they have everything you need. Huge slices and they have a great lunch meal deal."}
{"text":"This pizza is super delicious and reasonably priced. Great sides and salads (they are the same people as Aiello's). A totally legit neighborhood pizza spot."}
{"text":"Isa's pizza shares space with Aiello's Salumeria- same owners, same great Italian food. YUM!! We just got back from NY and I must say, this place has better pizza than any we ate there- sad for NY, great for us since we live in Phoenix! Previously, my favorite pizza place that we've loyally patronized was Rays on 3rd street/bell. Isa's Pizza on 7th/tbirdhas them beat in all categories of greatness- crust, sauce, cheese, toppings. Price is very competitive too. My favorite is Nonna's pie made with fresh plum tomato sauce with basil and garlic. Don't go for the ambiance- the over heats up the place like crazy, tables are awkwardly set up in the back area. Go for the best pizza that you will keep coming back for. It is a crime to skip this place. Don't miss the lunch special- $5.00 for 2 slices of cheese pizza and soft drink. I pay .25 extra/slice for a generous portion of proscuttio each slice"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never thought about trying out this pizzeria! Located just east of 7th street and thunderbird road.  You have an option to pick up or delivery. Being a native New Yorker I was impressed with the insider as it had a classical feel of a pizzeria! Now as for the pizza, the flavor took me back to a traditional slice of pizza from the city! Now I know what local pizzeria to visit when I'm in Be mood for some pizza !"}
{"text":"Hands down eggplant Parmesan and Nana's pizza are  the best two options in my opinion. At 2 slices with a soda for $6.50, it's hard to find a better bang for your buck. I'm talking authentic New York style pizza with fast and friendly service. They change their pizza by the slice daily, but you're bound to find something that suits you. Isa's Pizza has made it into my regular lunch rotations and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews.  The pizza was good but no substitute for a slice from Brooklyn. The slice and square were both very greasy and were missing the crunch and crust.  It was also upsetting that the counter man just threw the pizza into the box without a plate or wax paper.
It's also comical that when you ask for a slice you get a blank stare from the counter man. If it was really a New York slice you would not have to distinguish a slice of pizza as a \"cheese pizza\" when ordering."}
{"text":"Another Isa's Pizza?! The East Bell rd. area just got brighter!  Joey the master pie man creates awesomeness with his big pudgy fingers! The world is better now. Keep calm and eat Isa's pizza!

Nonna's pie, the best! Killer calzones and friggin serious stromboli. 

Go get a slice and enjoy yourself for a change. Rated best slice 2013 by one publication and top ten best pies 2013 by another. FORGETTABOUDIT!"}
{"text":"MARRONE! Joe and Myrah do it again! They have hired an outstanding pizza guy, also named Joe, which will make it easy for you to remember...lol. Joe makes incredible pies, and with the deli connected to the shop, you have everything. Look for the Nonna's pie, my favorite. The fresh Italian plum tomato sauce is insane, with hunks of fresh garlic and sweet basil. I took a quart of sauce home that night and brought it back with me to Hollywood. I spent the next few days slicing and toasting up some seeded semolina bread and just dipping it in and enjoying the great flavor. I just finished it today and need more! I don't know if i can wait a few weeks till I'm back in Phoenix, so someone needs to FedEx me a jar of Nonna's sauce and maybe a Nonna's pie too. The pie might be easier to FedEx since it's flat, go find out. 

The supreme pie with everything is delicious! Who the heck else is gonna use shittake and crimini mushrooms? FORGETTABOUDIT! Just go and eat and enjoy, and tell them Gino sent you. And don't forget to send me some sauce. 

Gino"}
{"text":"Genuine pizza that's has that really cheesy taste that we all love. The dough they use is amazing. I'm not a huge crust lover but there's is great. They have a lunch special with a slice and drink that's pretty reasonable. This is our pizza spot."}
{"text":"1) Service - Excellent. My family and I were greeted by almost the entire staff as soon as we got in. The girl at the cashier comped the chicken I added to my Gnocchi, no extra charge. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be like $4 extra. Maybe it was my natural charm, who knows. 

2) The Food - So delicious. I can only judge it based off of their Gnocchi Pesto (the only better Gnocchi I've had was in New York, and it's still a close call). The creamy pesto sauce was so good and the Gnocchi was cooked perfectly. Great food.

3) Price - A little steep. Almost a little too rich for my blood considering it's basically a pizza joint that serves pasta. It was almost $60 for me, my fiancé, and my father to eat. Both my fiancé and I got the pesto gnocchi and my dad got the chicken parm. Like I said, almost a little steep, but I'll pay it because that Gnocchi Pesto is so damn good. 

4) Ambience) Considering the price of this place I would expect to be walking into a nice/fancy Italian restaurant. It's in a nice location, but there's nothing really extraordinary about the interior. 

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who likes Italian food (who doesn't). The food is great and the people are awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for the 3rd time today, and it was even better than the last two times. The friendliness of everyone that works here is beyond outstanding...and Joey, the main pizza \"ar-tist\", is the best in Arizona at what he does.

The last time we came (Super Bowl Sunday), me and Denise grabbed a 14in Gluten Free Pie (she's celiac, so no hate please) that was half pepperoni-half Hawaiian, and it was without a doubt the best GF I personally ever had...it was also 4 inches bigger than Domino's, about the same price, and a LOT LOT LOT tastier. 

Anywho, on my trip today, I got the lunch special again; a slice of white pizza and a slice of the meatlovers...the white pizza there is, once again without a doubt, the BEST white pizza I have ever had. The ricotta and fresh mozzarella were so decadent, each bite was pure heaven. The meatlovers was also superb..... I'm not even a Ham-on-pizza-guy, but it so worked here. No complaints whatsoever...every bite of both slices was pure perfection, but their white pizza is to die for.

I'm convinced; if you've never been to New York to have a genuine slice of NY Pie there, or you've never had a slice of pizza at Isa's, then you, my friend, have never had REAL pizza.

Whether it's there 40th and Bell location, or their 7th Street and Thunderbird location, get to Isa's ASAP and take a bite of some of the best pizza you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Pizza was large and wasn't too greasy. We orders several pizzas and some of the pizzas were burnt. Parts that weren't burnt were quite tasty."}
{"text":"WOW, excellent pizza. I had a vegetarian pizza and they have ROASTED peppers...Yummy and the portion size is what a slice is supposed to look like, so you can fold it in half like a pie. Brings back memories of goodness. Worth the travel to pick it up."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, as close as you can find to NY. When the original people, the parents from Brooklyn were there daily it was better. Still good, but can be inconsistent. Tell them cook a little extra and eating in or pickup is best. Love the lunch specials, miss the jamaican beef patties no longer available."}
{"text":"Again-wow-amazing customer service and caring! Wish I could remove my first review!  Totally redeemed themselves!"}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" pizza place closed down and we have been on the hunt for a new place. After reading the reviews we thought, \"okay, let's give it a try.\"  My husband is an ex New Yorker and very hard to please when it comes to pizza.  After 3 slices of Nana's Pie he declared, \"the only thing I would change is to have the crust a little thinner.\" WOW that says it all. 

The pie's where great and the service when I went to pick up was awesome.  We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Phoenix. I'm a native New Yorker and haven't found anything close since moving here 6 yrs ago. I was at first extremely skeptically when they advertise NY style pizza given all the disappointment I have tasted. 
But this was the exception. Great thin style pizza. First it's actually hand tossed not rolled like some places. They serve slices. The sauce is a little sweet and it's not drowning in the pizza. My basic test is if I can enjoy a plain cheese slice, like I would in NYC, you're passed. And this place passed w flying colors. 
Now if only I can convince them to make me a fresh mozzarella pizza like Joe's in the West Village."}
{"text":"No doubt, the best pizza in town! Great family owned neighborhood restaurant! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Variety to choose, thin crust, delicious.Great team! We foun a new pizza place for our family!"}
{"text":"I used to have to drive over to the 7th and Thunderbird location but now the new location is much closer for me. I love their pizza it is my favorite in N Phx. Try the Aiello's House Salumeria (sandwich) is possibly the BEST sandwich in town!"}
{"text":"Giving them a second go and trying garlic knots this time. They were tasty. Bathroom still leaves something to be desired but hey for good pizza I'll go at home. Lol"}
{"text":"I thought i wrote my review for this already, but i guess not.

Pizza by the slice is done here, or you can order a whole pizza.

Pizza by the slice is nice because you can swing by for lunch without spending awhole lot. and Wait time for food is cut down a lot.

I loved the white pizza they had here.

Only thing that freaks me out is that the dude touched my pizza with his bare hands.... -_- sad day"}
{"text":"I have been to Isa's two times now. I was a big fan of Aiello's and was looking forward to Isa's opening in my hood.

The first time we ordered a pizza for pick up. We ordered the eggplant pizza. It was good yet slightly overcooked on the bottom. And the pizzas are pricey. It was over $20 for a thin crust that wasn't too filling. But still a great tasting pizza. The toppings are high quality. 

I ordered their lunch special to-go a few days ago. 2 slices and a drink. They have a good variety of pizzas to choose from for lunch. I had the eggplant and the white. Both mouthwatering. Much better crust this time, not overcooked. There is so much flavor packed into their pizza. Also had one of their garlic knots. They are heavenly. 

Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Their pizza sauce is too sweet for me. Their meat pies were full of heat but not super flavorful to me. My husband liked it, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've only had take out pizza here. The pizza is huge! The white pizza is amazing & super garlicky. The eggplant delight pizza is like eggplant parmigiana in pizza form & is delicious. We love them both!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best EVER! My boyfriend and I went to the one at 40th st and bell and gave it 4 stars, not because the pizza wasn't amazing but because he got a meatball sub that wasn't nearly as good as the pizza and we were really craving wings and they were out. Well, tonight my kids and I came to the 7th St and thunderbird location because it's closer to home. Wow! Just wow! As always the pizza is phenomenal but we also got the sweet chili glaze wings and they're the best wings I have ever had. The owner came by and talked with us and said hi to my 2 girls. This place is truly my favorite. This is my first ever yelp review so obviously that says something in itself!"}
{"text":"Meatball sub was amazing. Sausage and veal meatball did it for me. Was preoccupied with how delicious the meatball was that can't say much about the pizza except it was average after an great sub."}
{"text":"Address is listed wrong- It's 4001 E Bell Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85032

The pizza was really good NY style. But the staff totally outshine the food. I came in with a friend asked if they could do a pizza half/half. They said they could even do quarters. We didn't need that but would be great for families:)

My friend is in a wheelchair and he is total care. they offered to cut the pizza in small bites. I didn't even ask. That was sweet of them to pay attention- And very helpful. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... if you want thin crust done right, then this is the place to go. The lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5 M-F only) is excellent, and even better if you're sharing with a friend or significant other. The staff is incredibly friendly - I've been there five times so far and have never had a bad experience, and I've never had old/stale pizza like I have in so many other shops. 

My only criticism is that the place looks really dirty, and that's what brings my rating down from a five to a four. The floors look dirty, the tables inside always look dirty, and the condiment bar is often filthy. I can't bring myself to eat inside for these reasons."}
{"text":"Really good Pizza!! Found this place on iDine so got the discount also."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time today. The cheese pizza was alright. I wouldn't say it tasted like a New York pizza. It was a little over salted for my tastes."}
{"text":"Wow! Super friendly people and some seriously tasty pizza.  This will be a great place to grab a slice ( HUGE) or pick up a full pizza (that will probably feed at least 5 very hungry people). While my son and I waited, we looked over the menu a bit more. Garlic knots for .50....that was easy call! Added four of those bad boys to our order. Our meat lovers pizza was awesome and I could only eat one slice and one knot before I was stuffed. My always ravenously hungry teenage son could only do better by one knot.  

Will be looking for any excuse to return!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we read all the reviews before we ordered and we decided to try the Nana's Pie because everyone raved about it. Well now is my chance rave about this pizza! The Nana's Pie was sooooo delicious! It tasted homemade but better and it was so saucy and cheesy and full of flavor!!!! So glad we decided to try a new favorite pizza place! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love the pizza.  Love the Lunch Special 11-4 every day.  2 slices of cheese pizza and a fountain drink $5.00 plus tax.  Try the garlic knots for $0.50 each.  Fabulous.   

I hate letting the cat out of the bag because this is my favorite little secret in this neck of the woods.  Really, check it out.  Get the special and you will leave full!"}
{"text":"The Good:
- Great pizza
- Great value
- Fast Service

The Bad:
- Employees have bad attitudes - This younger-middle-aged woman who was taking my order hated her life!  I could hardly stand being in there for 5 minutes with her there. Her and the guy making pizza were clearly annoyed by each other.
- Obnoxious employee - This middle-aged big dude with white hair was the worst.  He was boisterous and obnoxious. I gathered he might be the owner.  And he was rude to one of his employees (a kid, maybe 18-20, who was the only employee who didn't make me want to run out the front door).



They have a lunch special that runs 11-4 daily: $5 for 2 (very large) slices of cheese pizza and a drink, which is an excellent value.  If you want something like pepperoni it's an extra $.25 per slice, or $.50 extra for specialty slices.

I've had the supreme, buffalo chicken, white, and nana's pie.  They were all tasty but I'd rank them: Buffalo chicken, white, supreme, nana's

With their great food and good prices, this place would have an easy 5 star review from me if I was greeted with a smile and the employees acted like they didn't hate their life."}
{"text":"Delicious and can you say fun?!  I order pizza to go and enjoyed watching the lunch madness  - these guys have pizza down to a science and they have fun too!!!  I can't wait to come back and try all the different types. Great lunch special and appreciate the convenience of Aiello's being there as well!"}
{"text":"Finally found a good New York style pizzeria.  You know it's good by the crust and there Crust is phenomenal.  Had a standard slice with pep and sausage, top notch.  Also had a slice with egg plant and ricotta it's a must have done exceptionally well.   Boom"}
{"text":"Accidentally deleted original review.  Ordered carryout last Friday evening.  It was already ready when I arrived.  After I paid they told me they made it wrong, that was bothersome they should have told me first.  Anyway they offered to remake it but I didn't want to wait.  I had ordered half pep/onion/olive and half Hawaiian- they didn't do the half Hawaiian.  To make up for it they gave me two Hawaiian slices.  The pizza was a bit bland.  I would eat there again for the  by the slice but wouldn't order a whole pie again.  The staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"I had the Buffalo Chicken Pizza delivered and it was great. I have also tried the pepperoni and it was ok. I feel it's a bit overpriced and I'd recommend only if you have a coupon."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem! It is, by far, my favorite pizza place! The owner is talented and knows how to make good food! Try the eggplant pizza..try all of them!!"}
{"text":"Ok. I need to blame this one on Mark R.  He always comes here and checks in. So I just had to check this place out and plus I'm always a sucker for a meatball sandwich. 

So of course I tried their Meatball Parmesan hero. Found out that the meatballs are not beef but veal and pork. Yum yum. It looked small at first but it's really filling. So good but my wife said it best \"that meatball sandwich was so dang good\". Really tasty. Not spicy at all. Also, when you order a hero you get a small salad too. Not bad but a little too much Italian dressing. 

Also, tried their lunch special which is two slices of pizza and a fountain drink. Just remember it's cheese pizza and if you pick one of their specialty pizza then it's an extra .50 each. So the special is really $6. Huge pieces of pizza. Really enjoyed it. Crust was good and a little chewy. Really liked their pizza. 

They were very nice in welcoming us, bring our food the the table, checking up on us, and thanking us for coming in. Very nice people working there. So now I know why Mark R always comes to this little pizza joint. Good pizza, good heroes, and friendly service. I think I found a new pizza joint and plan on coming back. Enjoy. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop Aiello got the store open today. You never would have noticed how hard they worked into the night yesterday except I was in the area and stopped in to say hi.

Today my son was out of school so we went to lunch. I decided we could go have the 'Lunch Special', 2 Slices & a coke $5.00.  I ordered the spinach slice and lil dude got the cheese. Our pizza, especially my spinach pie was excellent and sickie boy even ate almost all of his.

With a strong work ethic and a love for quality Italian food Isa's quickly will become the neighborhood pizza shop if it isn't already."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Friendly staff! 
We are pizza junkies at our house. We love ourselves some GOOOOOOOD pizza and Isa's is just that! My kids love it as well as my husband.  We are lucky to live close by! Highly recommend it, you must try!"}
{"text":"Always greeted with a friendly smile and the Sicilian slice keeps me coming for more."}
{"text":"Great place. The pizza is New York style and delicious. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"They have pizza by the slice!  THey also have full pies.  I personally loved the eggplant pizza and my daughter could have eaten all the garlic knots they had.  Desserts were good too.  They have more on the menu then just pizza, we can't wait to try everything.  If you have not been here then you need to go."}
{"text":"Great Italian food great atmosphere good people the fettuccine with the pink sauce just amazing I will keep going here!!"}
{"text":"Steady decline in quality since they opened. Tonight was finally too much. Horrible delivery service. Wrong pizza. Wrong soda. The box was crushed so the center toppings were stuck to the lid. It also must have been tipped on its side because the toppings slid off the pizza into the box hinge. The delivery driver called the store and because it was closing time, they wouldn't remake it. Had to get dinner somewhere else. He said they were going to give me a credit on my account for a pizza, but I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"What a great lunch! For one thing a Ceasar salad worth eating, with lots of anchovies . Then there are the meatballs, right out of the Big Apple and delicious. The sausage is darn good, too. The prices are reasonable, and the hard-working staff aim to please. The ambiance is pizza parlor  standard; the music a nice mix from rock. This is a place you want to visit."}
{"text":"It's a little bit pricey, but once you try the sauce on Nana's Pie, you'll happily up your pizza budget! It's a sweet plum base, with fresh garlic and basil, and I like to add chicken to it for a little extra protein. They've got good lunch specials if you're around during the day, and deliver, as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to pizza place. They have a variety of pizzas and their lunch time special is amazing. As someone who doesn't like marinara and always gets easy on the sauce when I order pizza, omg I can eat isa's marinara sauce with everything. The pizzas are sooooo good and so are the garlic knots. The owner is so nice as well. Always comes and talks to me and my family. I always recommend Isas to family and friends."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! if a big slice of greasy yummy pizza is what your looking for here it is. The staff is nice and the service is quick. If I lived around here it would be dangerous."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had in my life. Love there lunch special. Two slices and a drink for 5 bucks from 11a-4p!!! Pretty fair.  I have had the pepperoni,meat lovers, hawaiian, and buffalo chicken. They are all amazing. Salad is fresh. I've yet to try dessert but would love too. My favorite is the spinach pizza. Its white sauce and spinach and it is so good!! The pizza slices are big and they are far from dry. Such amazing pizza!! Wish I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I found this place driving by and saw a banner boasting having the best NY Pizza in Phoenix. I've been looking for that for a while. I could not help but swing in and try. The Pizza was real NY Pizza!! There was the right flavor, look, greasiness, and when you took that first bite the cheese had that great string from mouth to pizza. The staff was friendly. It was great fun watching the guy making the pizza spinning the dough over his head. And he had no hesitation to talk with me about his pizza and the restaurant. If you ever want to have a slice of NY, look no further. They also have a location on 44 ST. and Bell Rd."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. SUPER TASTY PIZZA. We ordered the Supreme for 22.00 The slices are HUGE. The dough is a perfect mix of fluffy crust but dense at the same time and the toppings seem fresh. Also ordered Chicken Cesar salad that I was super unimpressed with. I didn't care for the dressing. Next time I'll do just pizza. They nailed it in that department."}
{"text":"I was next door at another establishment and left unsatisfied.  I remember seeing something about Isa's Pizza.  I decided to peek in the window and saw that they had slices.  I walked in and ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese.  The pizza man grabbed my slices and threw them in the oven to crisp up.  I paid with a card and showed him my ID.   We had a nice little talk about the new AZ drivers licences and how they are pretty flimsy.  Anyways....really personable and friendly service.   Here is how the pizza tasted.............

Pepperoni Slice-  This was decent.  I really liked the thin, semi charred crust.  The sauce, cheese and seasoning was just ok though. They use a lot of dried oregano. The pepperonis were decent but I would have liked to have had them a bit more crispy.  The cheese was just alright...seemed like an average/lower quality cheese.

Cheese Slice-  Same thing.  Great crust but the cheese and seasonings were just ok.

$5.00 and change for 2 slices.  It was definitely decent pizza.  The service was super friendly.  I just don't know when I will be down this way again (It's 8 miles down Bell Rd from my work) and I would not drive down here on purpose.  If I lived in the area, I'm pretty sure I would try them again."}
{"text":"\"Man, Tim....another pizza review?\"  Yup.

I had this place bookmarked for quite some time.  When I first moved down here to Phoenix, I had gone to the Isa's down on Bell Rd.  I thought it was decent, but it was too far away for me to come back regularly.  I saw that they had another branch located closer to work so I decided to come down today to check it out.  

I walked in and was intrigued by the sign of \"2 slices and a drink for $5.00\" sign.  That is a smoking good deal!  I was browsing the slice selection and it was a little bit skimp.  There were single slices remaining on most of the pizzas and then a half of a Hawaiian pie left.  I decided to go with 2 slices of that and a drink.  I guess that the Hawaiian is a \"specialty\" pie or something, because my total was $6.50 instead of $5.00.  Still a good deal IMO.  The lady behind the counter was incredibly friendly and nice!  I paid her my money and she said she would bring my pizza out to me.  I grabbed my drink (Coke products) and sat down.  This place is a tad small and tight...there were other people eating and you kind of had to squeeze and slide around the tables as to not bump into them.  I think my large derriere actually hit some chicks chair.  My bad!  Anyways, here is how everything was...............

Hawaiian Pizza-  The lady placed these slices in front of me and they looked and smelled great!  These slices are HUGE.  They were piping hot and fresh out of the oven.  I took a bite and was impressed.  The bottom crust was crisp, the cheese was melted perfect, and the toppings were plentiful!  I was pressed on time so I had to scarf them down pretty quick!  The slices were so hot, I ate most of them with my fork.  I picked up the crust though and enjoyed that.  The end crust was a little bit too dry and not as chewy as I prefer, but it was still good and fit this type of pizza very well.

Overall, I liked it a lot.  I got there at a bad time (2:30pm) so they didn't have a wide variety to choose from, but to their credit, on the way out, they were pulling fresh pies out of the oven to restock their supply.  For a straight up slice spot, I think this might be the best place around in/near Deer Valley.  I know I will definitely be back to try out some of their other kinds of pizza!  Can't beat the value and customer service either!  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Friendly staff.  Delicious food. Good prices.  Every time I'm there I see the owner, watching over his restaurant, making sure everything is right.  
Great lunch special, two slices and a soda for $5.  Yesterday I had a slice with roasted eggplant, fresh mozzarella, and tomatoes.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried this place in my back yard and surprised at how good it was! Definitely one of the better quality pizzas in north Phoenix. Price wasn't bad either for the quality received. Will definitely think of them more often. Had the Eggplant pizza which was outstanding."}
{"text":"I went to the original a lot. So I tried the new one with friends and the pizza and services is still amazing. Try the white pizza it is amazing."}
{"text":"I was filling up gas at the gas station next door and notice this's new pizza place offering 2 slices and a soda for $5 so I decided to try it. Oh my god was this pizza good and the staff was so friendly and chef even says hello to you and asked how the meal was."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza! Best I've had in the valley, hands down. If you're craving some good old NYC thin crust (non artisan/gluten-free/hipster) cheese or pepperoni pizza, this is worth your time and money."}
{"text":"What a gem of a pizza place! For $3 a slice of whatever you want, you will think that you are on the East Coast.  It is not a surprise that this place is voted Best Pizza slice by the New Times and other locals. These are HUGE delicious slices of pizza. One slice of white pizza and a salad is a great dinner for being lazy. Such a bargain!  Such a deal!"}
{"text":"Some of the best NY style pizza I've had.  Try the nanna pizza, you won't regret it. I'll be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here they don't have garlic knots, don't have it on your menu if your not going to have them...annoying!!!"}
{"text":"A little late in writing this review but realized it had to be written because people should be forewarned.

I came in a couple weeks ago to pick up a pizza I had called in an order for. When I got there, the pizza wasn't done. Not a huge deal since I didn't have anywhere else to be right away, but it would be nice to get an accurate estimate when calling ahead - if you're slammed, err on the longer side so your customers aren't waiting while their cars are heating up in 110 degree weather. Also, the pizza was undercooked and had a ton of cornmeal (or something) all over the bottom. Not appetizing at all.

But the real kicker was this: While I was waiting, I stood back from the counter a little bit when in walked two homeless people (you'll soon understand why that's relevant). One of them placed their order for various items which included a couple slices. 

Brace yourselves. The other person was looking on as the owner/manager (I assume because she was older) was struggling to get a couple shoddily sliced pieces onto a metal tray to warm in the oven. She didn't have gloves on so she was fumbling around with tongs and a spatula - hilarious, but I digress. There's this little space between the window and the counter and the pizza started to slide to the customer side of the glass partition because the pieces would not come loose when, I kid you not, the homeless woman began pinching the crust with her bare, visibly filthy hands.

It didn't seem that the manager noticed because she was too busy trying not to touch the pizza herself - how ironic. Anyway, my pizza was done a minute later and I got the manager's attention and quietly told her that she should toss the rest of that pizza for obvious reasons. She laughed, said \"Yeah, right. I would have noticed that. I can manage my own business, thanks.\" and walked away.

DEAL. BREAKER. I feel terrible for anyone else that might have eaten slices of that pizza because the manager was too cheap to trash it. I'll be going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"First of all we had great customer service there and it's very clean friendly workers and very helpful.  The pizza is amazing and the wings also . I enjoy every time I go there most of all I can take my family there. The pizzas are new york style so it takes me back home . Big slices too ,  so get ready to enjoy !!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing slices! I've been coming to Isa's for years and absolutely bomb pizza. Their ingredients are top notch and you won't find a better place for slices. They have an amazing lunch deal and it's great for a easy quick dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza they have the best big giant slices and so many kinds to choose from. Great place to get lunch to go. Must try"}
{"text":"The more we eat here the more I think of them. I acquired a taste for good pizzano pizza, working in my uncle's pizza place on revere beach. I met. Mr. Ianello, by chance one day talked about making pizza. He made my day as he told me about the the ingredients of a few of his pies. I was very surprised at his attention to detail with ingredients that go into various.. Really good and quality ingredients in those pies. And BTW, we are not related !  I just love well made pizza. It comes as no surprise that they have been recognized as the  # 1  pizza place in Phoenix !!"}
{"text":"You know how NY boasts neighborhood pizzerias that feel like extended family? Places that are always delicious and genuine? We'll we stole one of them. This is it.

Btw, the Nana slice is incredible. Nothing else like it around."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice any time of day. The lunch special is worth it as well. My favorite pizza is their White Pizza. Just perfect. They do have gluten-free crusts as well, so that is a bonus. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their price for a whole pie. It's a bit high. Great fresh pizza is hard to find, granted, but -- and forgive me please -- but it is PIZZA. I will never understand how prices can vary in pizzerias. Some are outrageous, some are outstandingly cheap. Isa's borders on the higher side."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there.  The $5.00 pizza special was delicious, pizza slices are generous.  What may stop me from going back is the questionable cleanliness of the place.  I watched the girl making the pizza, she was not wearing gloves, isn't that a health requirement when preparing foods?  If I had seen this before I started eating, I don't think I would have ordered.  I hope that I don't get sick.  Now that I'm home, I think that I should have said something to her about it before I left."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and fresh, the cook with the beard is always super friendly and welcoming. Chef is frequently out checking in with customers. My boyfriend and I went in for 2 huge slices each with drinks for less than $12. I'm obsessed with the spinach pizza. This neighborhood gem is our go to."}
