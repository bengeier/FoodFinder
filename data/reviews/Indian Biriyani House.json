{"text":"Horrible food...specially chicken biryani and butter chicken! Avoid this place, not worth it"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery using TasteAway because they had a crazy good deal. Food I received was abysmal. 4 pieces of floating bone with tough meat and tendon was what I received in my 2 lamb dishes, and the butter chicken dish had a floating chicken drumstick in it with a few other pieces of fatty, tendon-y chicken. Also the take-out containers were under-filled and some arrives lukewarm. Worst $40 I've ever spent on food. So disappointed. And I love Indian food.."}
{"text":"Cold steam table food. Hot fresh naan. Don't bother. Too bad as I think the bread deserves so very much more."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Lamb biriyani  It took them a while to prepare my lamb biriyani in the kitchen, but it would explain why it was so tasty! Not to mention it's quite spicy too. It's a pity the portion size is a bit small. It's definitely the top 3 biriyani I have tried.

{"text":"The Chicken Biryani totally missed the mark. In fact, it somehow smelt like fish? weird. it tasted quite bland, perhaps why i was asked if i wanted curry on my Biryani. Traditionally, Biryani is rice with the curry and flavouring all there already. I had tried this place around 3 years ago and found it quite decent, very disappointed by todays order though.  The Mango milkshake however, was divine.  I'll give this place another shot with a different menu option before completely ruling it off my list incase they were having an off-day. Atleast the food was dirt cheap ($5 for 2 portions)"}
{"text":"First off I love Indian food. I eat it at least once a week. Ive been to this particular restaurant 3 times now, the first 2 times were average but the 3rd time was a whole other story...  I ordered the Chicken Biriyani for $5 or $6. First off, the food was cold. Like straight out of the refrigerator cold. It was also really salty and there were only 2 small pieces of chicken (mostly bone). Essentially it was just biryani rice. My girlfriend started picking at one of the chicken pieces and kept asking what kind of meat it was because it was so tough. After inspecting it myself, we flipped the piece over and it was COMPLETELY RAW! Right away I felt sick. I brought it up to the owner and instead of taking responsibility he says to me \"Oh thats Biriyani chicken\".. ummm what? then he continues making excuses like \"Yea thats how its suppose to be\". After just staring in disbelief he finally says, \"Ok I will replace it\" Replace it?? Replace the raw chicken with more raw chicken? After realizing how stupid an idea that was, he ended up giving me curry with rice (which I ended up giving to a homeless person).  The thing that ticked me off the most was how he would not take responsibility for the raw chicken. There are a lot of other Indian restaurants downtown. Do not risk going here and putting your health on the line. I have also contacted Toronto Public Health and filed a formal complaint about this restaurant. Hopefully theyll do a check in the near future."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Indian food I have ever . It definitely we'll be my go to spot when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Their chana masala could've been better, but their veg biryani is very good and very authentic... the flavour isn't toned down. Would go again for biryani but not for the vegetable curries."}
{"text":"Good because it's had a TV with the Eurocup game and that was it's saving grace.  Inside it's kind of a hole.. now I can forgive that if the food was cheap and it tasted good.   It wasn't.  Had a curry chicken, rice, and chick peas. I could have made better at home. Really saucy curry and hard chickpeas.  Tada to a tune of $10 dollars :(  There's better Pakistani / Indian food in Toronto, on Queen St  or Gerrard. You're hard pressed to find it in the immediate area though."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop establishment.  Better than some corporate / chain restaurants if you want something different.  If you like curry, it will work for you.  The service was fast.  Probably because it was during rush hour, and people were heading home.  However, the food was good; especially for some tourists wanting something good, quick and affordable to eat!  I liked it."}
{"text":"Got the half tandoori chicken with rice to-go. Started eating an hour later and the chicken was still hot. The chicken was very flavorful and spicy. However the rice was very bland, just plain rice.   I'd like to come back and try the chicken biryani or the curries I saw people there having."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Indian restaurants in all the of the GTA. Their quality is terrible and their portions are just nonsense.   I ordered their chicken biryani and they piled on a ton of rice on one tiny chicken leg. Other places give you at least 3 pieces of chicken for the same price.  Total rip off"}
{"text":"Food is too Oily!!   This place is close to my work place so thought will have a quick lunch Monday afternoon it was and I had a late lunch here and I've asked for goat biryani . After waiting for 20min I got my food which the man who was serving me added some gravy on the rice  Meat was hard,black and burnt  Rice was reheated too oily and dried    I will Not recommend to anyone who look for traditional Indian biryani . Better this place should change the name to Bangladeshi biryani house  Will never consider this place again . I would recommend them to Increase the price and serve better food"}
{"text":"Some of the worst Indian food in the city. Had better tikka masala out of a jar. Not to mention really small portions. Only had 2 pieces of chicken I the whole meal."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  The server actually smeared the food widely on the plate to give it the illusion that it was a reasonable size serving.  This actually was a mixed blessing, because shortly after finishing the meal, I had a bad case of the runs.  I shudder to think how long I would have spent on the loo if I actually ate a full serving.  Stay away...Thank me later."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS: HORRIBLE RESTAURANT OWNER. He basically harassed me on the phone and was extremely condescending. He said \"Would you like me to close down my store so I can talk to you on the phone?\" and hung up on me. So insulted and disgusted as a customer... No person should be treated that way."}
{"text":"Always have walked by this place and never ventured in until today. Yay for Indian food close to my house!  Service was extremely friendly. All the veggies and meats are already prepared so you get your order very quickly. One man was in charge of the naan, which was crispy and big for only $1.50  I had the Thursday butter chicken special (special = comes with rice or naan) for $7.99. Was scared that it would be way too spicy but I found it mild, and my spice tolerance is extremely low. Tasty and I love how they use dark meat. Rice was fluffy.   Busy during lunch, mainly take-out but there are tables inside. Cash and card accepted."}
{"text":"If your set on eating here, there's about a 2 hour window where you'll be able to eat fresh food.  Otherwise, they'll just stick it in the microwave.  Umm...no thanks...I'm not paying for smoeone to stick food in a microwave.  I rarely use mine at home, so I'm definately not gonna pay for microwaved food.  Not a fan of the biryani here, but the tandoori chicken is really good."}
{"text":"I been here twice now  My review is on the Paneer Matar and the naan bread. Get the Paneer Matar if you like your curry a little sweet :) The Paneer is deep fried and mixed in a rich creamy curry with peas. The naan is freshly baked which is amazing especially for its price of $1.50 I got 3 naan bread and I finished all of it cause it was so soft and went so well with the Paneer Matar.   The server was really nice, he even put foil around the container of curry to make sure it will be hot!   A 5 stars for me! I will try the Paneer makhi and tandoori chicken next time and definitely get the freshly baked naan bread again"}
{"text":"Got the Lamb Curry with regular rice and chickpeas side for 8.99. The taste was decent but I'm no Indian food expert. Meat portion size not all that great. There were maybe 7 pieces max, 1 or 2 pieces were mainly bone. But for sure it was better than the time I got food from Matagali (15 dollars for a small cup of mainly sauce, ~3 pieces of meat, no rice, and wasn't all that good).  Coke bottle (710mL) was 1.99, which is cheaper than most places downtown here (I think 591mL for $2+ dollars in the area).  I'm assuming the guy who served me was the owner. Nice guy.  Quality: 7/10. Service: 7.5/10. Value: 5.5/10. Overall: 6 out of 10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here, and will be my last. I got the veggie combo to-go (choice of 3 veggies + rice/naan). For $7.99, it seemed too good to be true (bad sign #1).  The server was a jovial man and asked me \"how are you?\" twice. Then he asked me, \"rice or naan? Rice?\" and before I could choose, he had already started scooping rice into a takeout container (bad sign #2). I wanted naan, but being a polite Canadian a.k.a. doormat, I didn't say anything. That was when I noticed that the rice did not look like high-quality or even regular-quality basmati rice (bad sign #3). Before I could choose which veggies I wanted, he said, \"chickpeas?\" and scooped in the chickpeas. I would  probably have picked them anyway, but it was a bit annoying. I chose the spinach and mixed veggies (the carrots and beans looked like they could have been frozen-veggie quality). Everything looked more oily than I am used to (I frequently eat Indian food, and only came here because my favourite place downtown, Curry & Co, was closed). The man did not wear gloves (bad sign #4), and when I was paying I was a bit grossed out by the fact that his hands/fingernails were spice/food stained when he entered the amount on the touchpad.   When I sat down to eat it, everything tasted wrong. The rice was not fluffy. The food looked unappetizingly oily, and the chickpeas tasted slightly bitter. I tried a potato, and noticed one of them had gone bad. I forced myself to try the spinach and it had the same off taste- a bit sour and bitter. After sampling everything, I gave up.  td;lr: bad quality veggies and rice, not worth the price even though it's cheap."}
{"text":"We've been so happy with our dining decisions here in Toronto.  The Biryani House was equally enjoyable.  The kids had butter chicken with rice and naan and it was tastey.  They also loved the fried paneer as an appetizer.  We tried the chicken masala and vindaloo.  Perfectly spicey and the lady that served us was so sweet and attentive.  It is cozily located partially underground beneath some apartments on Elm.  They also serve Thai food which I'm sure is awesome too.    Do it!  And don't listen to that dude that says it's bland. . .he's crazy!  It was sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice for take out and so far I really like it.  The food tastes good and well prepared and for the price! I don't think you can go wrong, service is quick and the person behind the counter was courteous and accommodating.  It's not a fancy place, If you want to be pampered, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Biryani House serves a legit Chicken Biryani. So delicious, I crave it almost everyday. In fact I'm craving it now and I just had my Thanksgiving dinner.  Let me break it down: It's a small hole in the wall. Small space, some seating and a mom + pop working the counter. There aren't too many options but that's quite alright. All you need to know is to order the Chicken Biryani, a set meal with tender chicken served on fragrant and flavourful rice. In addition to this, order the naan bread. It's made in their Tandoor Oven which is made to order, soft and crispy. Perfect with a side of butter chicken sauce for dipping.  The best part about all of this is the price, about 7 bucks for the whole set and portions are big. Make sure to chat with the owner, he's a nice guy and will remember you the next time you come in.  Overall, it's a nice place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. It's nothing fancy, just simple quality home cooked food. Very worthwhile to check it out and it sure beats the food court choices out there."}
{"text":"Quick, simple place to eat. Pretty busy New Year's Eve, chicken biriyani ran out so we went for the meat combo with naan. 1 meat curry and 2 veg curries.   Limited space to sit, but we got a table. They get top marks for the naan. Freshly made to order! We'd definitely go back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I had the Thursday special (butter chicken on rice); there's nothing special about it.   The guy serving me strategically scooped the butter chicken to give me the least amount of chicken and most amount of sauce. Probably to rehydrate the dry rice.   The quality of food is not worth $9!"}
{"text":"Lots of bones in food, i cant understand which part of beef. Definitely not fresh. Close to ten dolar for nothing."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and cheap Indian food! Also, the staff is super friendly...it was my first time seeing a Tandoori oven and they invited me around the counter to check it out and watch them make nan...super cool.  Anyhow, highly recommended and cheap as can be, go here!"}
{"text":"Steer clear of this restaurant.  I ordered dinner for two and they double charged me for additional butter chicken and samosas.  Not to mention, they gave me all of the wrong dishes and when the restaurant was called they were completely dishonest about it.  Don't give your credit card to this restaurant unless you want to find extra charges.  Terrible !"}
{"text":"Ok to be honest I've gotten takeout biryani   from here a half dozen times. It's the only place in this neighbourhood you can get chicken biryani with rice. And sometimes I just gotta have biryani.   That being said, it's not the best.... While I'm puzzled how one reviewer can claim that it's bland, since the spices are quite strong, the biryani rice was definitely under-salted today. My lunch companion also complained that her butter chicken was quite dry and the spinach was tasteless.   Still, I don't think I can claim I won't be back. For about a pound and a half of food at $5 it's a value that can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic and the prices are reasonable. It's good if u want local Indian food. The naan is very fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today. The short end of the story is, I ordered the butter chicken, got cooked unflavored chicken in a store bought bottled tomato sauce. I took two bites, threw the food in the garbage and left to eat at  Eaton Center food court. My advice is if your used to rich Indian flavored food, this is not the place. Arg..."}
{"text":"Nice place.. awesome taste.. if you're interested in something cheap, awesome and near university ave then visit this place."}
{"text":"An okay place that we stumbled upon. Had the chicken Marsala. I will admit, he warned me it would be spicy and it was. My disappointment was the lack of chicken on my plate. Had there been more I would have eaten more. My dinner companion had the lamb curry.  She said it had an after bite with heat and she did have plenty of lamb. Since only here for one more week I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Ridiculously small portions and just tastes like any Indian food. Ordered butter chicken which costs $7.90, and look at how little you get!"}
{"text":"The year was 2006. I was reckless, lying to my parents about horrible things like needing Plan B or Monistat so they would wire me money that I would later use for cigarettes or booze. I was a shell of myself, but damn, cigarettes were expensive! $11.00 a pack! And we smokers in NYC are complaining...  Anyway, there was this sketchy yellow-lit little \"Indian\" joint. If you sat down to eat you'd have to take 3 showers and dry clean your clothing because the curry scent would never leave. So we didn't go for the food. We went for the contraband. Cartons of Benson & Hedges for $45.00 each. It was a miracle. Far better than the counterfeit Afghani Marlboros our friends were trying to peddle to us. It took a while for me to be able to buy the cartons from these guys, but once they were accustomed to me entering the establishment flanked by a gang of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian dudes they relented.   The biryani is decent, but not worth the cloak of curry fumes you'll leave with. A carton of cigarettes for $45.00? Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken biryani was tasteless and the chicken pieces dry and all bone. I thought the name of the restaurant would suggest they specialize in biryani but that is not the case at all! Not authentic and tasted very blend. My friend got a vegetarian plate and the amount was so minuscule, it didn't even fill up the container. If you are in the area its worth it go walk a little further on Dundas to Dalhousie to Curry Kitchen. There biryani is much much better and twice the size. Service was not great either.  Might as well have gotten plain rice with bones on the side."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, generous portion.  Got the Tuesday chicken biriyani special for $4.20 after tax. Happy full belly, and didn't hurt my wallet.   Also free wifi"}
{"text":"I eat here fairly regularly because they have generous portions for a good price and they aren't afraid to heat up the spice. It's not terribly creative food but it's comforting."}
{"text":"Biryani House opened at this location several months ago. The location has changed over several times so I was hesitant to try it. That being said, after passing by on several occasions I figured I should give it a chance.   I had already eaten dinner and was just looking for a little snack so I grabbed a few of their veggie samosas. While they were quite tasty, I did find them to be a bit on the cool side (maybe as a result of having sat out for a while) and they were quite small. They did satisfy my hunger though!  Because of it's location I will likely return for the samosas, but I'm not about the other dishes."}
{"text":"I went to Indian Biriyani House for some Indian takeout. Indian Biriyani House is small rundown restaurant. The service was okay since they have problems selling large takeout dishes. It was difficult to order from them.  I ordered the beef curry and butter chicken. The butter chicken was pretty good typical of other butter chicken dishes in other Indian restaurants. The beef curry was too spicy and we did not like it too much.  Would we go back? Maybe if we were in the mood for Indian food."}
{"text":"I have been there several times, mostly on a Friday to take out for Spouse and I.  The food is good and the gravy very rich.  Nice quality basmati rice.  The service is perfunctory, at best, but what do you want for an inexpensive meal?  The place is a bit of a \"hole in the wall\" but don't be put off by it.  I particularly like the masala mix of the curry there."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for Indian food and we walked into this hole in the wall. I had heard in the past that some of the tastiest cuisines are served in places resembling hole a place as this and boyyy were we pleasantly surprised.  Right away we were greeted by the most humblest server behind the counter and were seated. We ended up ordering Meat samosas which were filled with spicy minced beef and peas perfectly marinated in Indian spices and served with mint chutney. We also ordered spicy chicken biryani, butter chicken, mango lassies and buttered naans. Biryani was so far the best in the downtown core and was something one would eat at an Indian wedding; it had the perfect mix of grease and masalas.  Food was extremely low in price; the whole dinner ended up being under $20 dollars. We will be definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. I was planning this meal for days, and it didn't disappoint. Simple, delicious, reasonable price."}
{"text":"I had the lamb biriyani for $9.99. Hardly any lamb (half of the lamb was bone anyway) and the dish overall was just greasy and not flavourful at all. Tasted like something that should have costed $3. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted naan.  The lady that was serving me seemed to roll her eyes and say are you sure you don't want rice? Then she called someone to make her naan. Sheesh. The butter chicken is stone cold though but Atleast the naan was fresh but $9. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Butter chicken take out: Huge portion, decent quality, amazing price  Good for super cheap takeout but not for dinner with friends"}
{"text":"9 bucks for that, never again! combos are not so cheap (what the hell did other reviewers had for 5 bucks that was a real meal?). Only the portion of rice was quite generous, not that of the meal/meat/veggies. The place in addition does not look so clean, so I ate my plate rapidly, almost only thinking of the GI issue I might have in the next days (and praying not to have food poisoning - which I did NOT). One good point = spicy food, but not very elaborated. you want indian food = try another one than this."}
{"text":"I was searching the web for some Halal food and this was the first thing that popped up. Knowing that I am not familiar with what's good or bad here, I gave this place a shot. I ordered a lot of food that includes tika misala chicken, lamb dish, beef dish and some naan.   My food took 2 hours to get delivered. Estimated delivery time said 45 minutes. After the 1 hour and 15 minute mark I gave them a call and they just said the delivery man has been on his way and you should get it in a few minutes. 15 minutes later, I call again with my food nowhere to be found, they said they are located far from me and it's normal. At the 2 hour mark, I finally get a call from the delivery man and he said he walked 2 kilometers cause all the roads were closed but NONE was closed!   So what happened? Did the driver go for a joy ride and decide to deliver my food later? I'm not sure.   I got my food, and the food was barely warm. So it was obviously out for a while. I asked for my food to not be spicy, and the tika misala was on whole different world. The spice was mouth numbing and I couldn not eat it. The lamb and beef were filled with greese. Naan was super burnt.   Overall, this place was not good at all. Delivery was really bad, maybe if you went in to eat it'll be better, i'm not sure. But i'm def. not ordering delivery again from here.   I hope everyone else enjoys it.   Tips: 1) DON'T ORDER DELIVERY"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best Indian food  location I have been but it was not terribly too bad.  I don't think I would go back considering there are many other places in Toronto to explore.  The interior is a bit run down, it is not very cheap as my two dishes came up to about $20.  Ordered lamb biryani and saag paneer.  I have to say the biryani was most disappointing where the lamb was clearly frozen and was reheated--meat was very very very dry and the biryani was just pilaf rice without the pillowyness and flavouring it should have.  The Saag Paneer was alright.  I have walked passed this place numerous of time and finally went in, and that is that."}
{"text":"Just finished my takeout lunch. This place is minutes away from my work so i figured its a crappy now day/...lets get some cheap biryani for lunch.  The Good: The prices. Chicken Biryani and side of naan for $7.05 after tax. Amazing. And portion was HUGE. Such nice people workign in this small mom and pop shop. So friendly and sweet. It pains me to say what im goign to say next.  The Bad: Did not enjoy this very much... ive had way better chicken biryani. It was dry... the chicken was okay... they didnt ask me how spicy i like it so it was quite mild. No side of the yogurt dip :(   The ugly: Oily. Very very oily. So much oil everywhere. To be honest the coatign on the bottom of my styrofoam container made me feel a bit sick.  Conclusion: By far the best chicken biryani I have had is at Indian Roti House on Queens Quay. They ask you how hot and make it fresh to order for you. generous portions. No naan. but ltos of the yummy yogurt sauce to chill the heat. Priceier and kinda out of the way but DAMN good. Sorry guys. Wont be back here,"}
{"text":"I went and had the butter chicken with rice & naan. The butter chicken was average flavour wise but the portion size was large. The naan bread however was delicious and made fresh on the spot in front of you.  In general decent value for $10. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall indeed. I have been there for several occasions. It's quick and close to work. Food quality is low. Price is economical. Nothing to write home about.   Generally, vegetable curry is $4.99 without rice or naan. Vegetarian combo is $6.99. Meat combo $7.99.   Daily specials are also offered: Monday - 1/4 Tandoor Chicken with Rice or Naan ($3.99) Tuesday - Chicken Biriyani ($3.99) Wednesday - 1/2 Tandoor Chicken with Rice or Naan ($7.99) Thursday - Butter Chicken with Rice or Naan ($6.99)  Naan is made to order at Indian Biriyani House. There are not many Indian food options in the neighborhood, if you are looking for a quick bite, pre-made heat lamp food is not a bad option.   If you are able to walk for blocks, I would recommend heading to the Village by the Grange. The general rule of thumb is, the further west you walk, the less commercial and cheaper the food offerings. Not to mention it's a good exercise before you indulge!"}
{"text":"This place really doesn't look like it should have any business doling out edible goods. It's generally empty, kind of dilapidated, and the sole person working behind the counter couldn't wait for me to leave so he could get back to watching BBC news. If this was a front for the Pakistani mafia, I wouldn't be surprised.  Still, given that a container of chicken biryani was barely more than a fin (with an extra dollar for boneless) I couldn't expect much. The place had an inviting aroma of saffron and spices, and the foodstuffs -- living in steam trays -- looked tasty. I grabbed a chicken biryani to go. Then I witnessed something crazy. Something unthinkable. The man behind the counter took my styrofoam container full of rice...  And put it in the microwave.  Calm down, I told myself. I had to remind myself that this is rather commonplace among brown peoples. My mom wouldn't think this is a big deal. It was only in there for 15 seconds. It's still good. Right? Also: will this kill me?  I took it home and opened the box with trepidation. I was hit with a waft of deliciousness and threw all caution to the wind stuffing my face with forkfuls of rice. Damnit, it was pretty good. The chicken was the standout, really moist and not dry at all (in spite of sitting in a steam tray and then being microwaved WTF). The rice was really flavourful too. Some of it was a bit dry but I had asked them to toss some masala on there, which also serves to add some kick.  This was two servings of rock-solid rice and chicken for $5. Fine dining it is not, but a terrific value. They accept debit, but not credit.  Obligatory Title Pun: A mind PILOU-ing value proposition.  Menu Readability: A red board features their standards, and a chalkboard features the specials.  Need to mention: Here is an article about styrofoam and microwave safety. It's not as bad as y'all think. http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/HEALTHbeat_081606.htm#art1  What this place teaches me about myself: I've heard of 'nuke the whales', but 'nuke the chicken'?"}
