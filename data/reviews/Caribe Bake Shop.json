{"text":"Tried Caribe for the first time and it exceeded all expectations. Literally everthing I had was phenomenal. It's not in the best area, but other than that it is great. Also, the prices are extremely cheap. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Anytime I want Rican food on Sundays, this is where I go. Get acapurrias (fried dough with various fillings), empanadas, tostones, bacalao (my favorite), morcilla (my other favorite- blood sausage), pork, and rice y gandules, among others. Set up cafeteria style, the inside is not much to the eye and favors take out. This place stays packed- you'll have to park on the street. Cheap food, friendly employees, and enough limbe to go around makes me a happy customer.  What you have to try: -Cubano (huge ass cuban sandwich on their fresh baked bread.) -Morcilla (spicy blood sausage.. I get some every time I'm there) -Coconut/strawberry/pineapple/tamarind limbe (fruit and coconut milk blended and frozen into an icy dessert.. $1 yum) -Pinchos (when they are grilling outside) -chicarron (pork ribs that are fried into pork rinds. Crunchy, probably horrible for you but amazing none the less)  I'm going here this weekend for sure. If they made pasteles year round I would never leave."}
{"text":"New digs , same groovy eats. Morcilla and house made hot sauce.  Do not miss. Stellar Cuban sandwich . Plenty of hot dishes to  choose from  on the long steam tables a customer orders from. Carnitas  , stews , mofongo . Take your pick.Prices here are still neighborhood friendly , as is the new cider bock building which is in the style of breezy Island outposts. Friendly service .   Make certain to pick up a crusty loaf of bread to take  home."}
{"text":"I've been here first time before one year ago and bought the sugary dessert lol I can't remember the name's of it.   And by mistake I lost the address but today by chance I drove my wife to somewhere.. Then I saw some building has arts, suddenly I remember this is Puerto Rico area.   So, I used Yelp for looking for my favorite bakery and I found it. They are so kind & nice with me and they gave me some for free.  Thanks Yelp   Don't worry because old decorations   BUT. ( OLD IS GOLD )"}
{"text":"Recap. Used be a wee bit scarey. New building way better even during the construction. Line is out the door for a reason. Hubby is from PR and says its authentic. Every single thing i have had has been fabulous. The pork is awesome and the beans, and potato balls. Honestly just eat everything. This place should be on the food channel, clevelands hidden gem. Again cant say enough you have GOT to try this place.  Staff is rushed because so busy, but always seems nice.  They sell baked goods, but i javent ever tried anu, too full of lunch for dessert."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great Cubano since I moved to Cleveland. I found one once but that place went out of business. I was ecstatic to read all the great reviews about Caribe Bake Shop.  The place has a fairly decent sized seating area, but most people seem to go in for take out. You walk up to the counter to order, most food is visible, cafeteria style but nothing is named so if you're not familiar with Cuban food, you may need to ask. Don't worry they are very friendly. Everything looked good, but we really went here for a Cubano sandwich.   We ordered two sandwiches and a side of plantains. The plantains were okay, I have had better elsewhere. They were best when they were still warm, once they cooled down became kind of hard and lacked any real flavor at that point. The Cubanos come in three sizes, small, med and large, we opted for medium. They were so big. Easily set half aside for another meal. I can only image how many sandwiches could be made from the large...enough to feed a family? The sandwiches are made as you order and took about 10 minutes. The bread was fresh, soft and chewy on the inside with a great crunch on the outside.  This place was constantly busy, the line never seemed to slow down.  Just a good testament as to how great the food is...next time I can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"This place really does deserve four stars, but due to the scenery, neighborhood and the fact that the inside needs a serious remodel and some air conditioning I dinged them. The food here can sometimes be a little inconsistent too. Sometimes I absolutely love my food and other times I can't help but to feel a little disappointed (and I have been coming here on and off for years).  One thing that always gets me back in the door is the pizza empanadas. Others don't think their as good as I do (just an empanada with pizza sauce and tons of cheese, no meat). I also like their other fried side items too (fried potato balls filled with meat, fried yuca filled with meat and other empanandas--chicken and beef). The fresher the better, it makes a huge difference.   Please try their cream cheese pastry (long, glazed and thin). These remind me of a puerto rican donut. This weekend I tried one fresh from the oven and it was incredible. If you have an opportunity to try one this fresh please order several, they are just that good."}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its cover.  The food will blow your mind.  Rice, beans and carnitas - so authentic and delicious.  Just wish it was closer to home.  Try the whole pig.  The skin was heaven.  Fed my family of 4 for under $30 and had plenty to take home for another meal."}
{"text":"Kind of a cafeteria style experience. Bakery items in one case and an assortment of Puerto Rican food and Latin food staples in the other. This place serves the neighborhood community. Nothing pretty on the inside, but large portions of tasty, affordable, authentic food. Most of the staff speak Spanish and English but the clientele were all speaking Spanish when I was there. Nonetheless, they were warm and accommodating"}
{"text":"The most delicious authentic Cuban you will find in Cleveland. Roasted pork, maduros, chicharrones. Everything is good! Oh and the flan is excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was good and I would go there all the time however I got bread from there and there was a roach in the bag. I tossed it out and went back on another occasion and  saw roaches crawling on the glass on the donut side.  gross !!!  Needless to say I stop going there!!!!"}
{"text":"Good enough hole in the wall as my mom used to say. It felt like some nice ladies trying to feed their community for a good price and healthy portions in a very modest setting. I got the $8 combination to go. Yellow rice and beans with pulled pork (lots of food.) A beef pie for $2...tasty and crispy. Almost liked that better than my meal. Also a cake with some kind of sweet milk poured on top for $3.50."}
{"text":"I called them with a last minute large catering order and they did a fabulous job! I had to sneer one of the chicken empanadas (before the event) and it is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The Good: My girlfriend brought me here one summer afternoon when we wanted to just grab something delicious and go to the lake. Man was I in heaven. When we first pulled up I wasn't sure about this place but then I remembered the golden rule of local food spots.. The more run down it looks the better the food. Otherwise why would anyone keep coming back. So I dove in with both feet. And haven't looked back since. Everything here is good. Get some rice a meat of your choice and a pizza \"Empanada\" for desert. Wash it down with a Malta :) perfect afternoon.   The Bad: The neighborhood isn't the best and curb appeal leaves something to be desired but the food is seriously good and everyone who works here is friendly. Even other customers will help you figure out whats what and make recommendations.  Eat here once and you're hooked.  My Take: This is a local gem tucked away on the west side that I hope never goes away. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"I've been going here off & on for has to be 20 years, usually Sundays, fresh bread and roasted pork ( so good) the occasional empanada or alcapurra. Today I stopped in to get some fresh Morcilla and decided to grab some lunch so I got rice & gandules, carneguisada ,habichueles and a side of bistec. Got home and was really disappointed in the whole meal, the rice was so mushy, overcooked and bland, the carne guisada tasted days old  and some pieces of beef were rubbery, the bistec was flavorful but not the flavors I'm used to for this dish, it was more like beef and gravy something you would get at Golden Corral.  I will return for my occasional bread and roast pork but I will never get that cafeteria/buffet food ever again."}
{"text":"Tried Caribe for the first time and really enjoyed the food! I love these hole in the wall places, the no frills type. I'm newer to Puerto Rican food so I'm not an expert, but I can say that Caribe knows how to cook!! (Kitchen staff shouted from the back about how people can't stay away because their food is so good!) Located in the Clark-Fulton neighborhood, it's easy to pass if you're not watching--look for a small yellow building. We parked on the side street. If you're new to the Clark-Fulton, which is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in all of Ohio. It's a great place. If you're new to hole in the wall - be assured that all will be ok.   Caribe is mostly buffet-style with sandwich options. Though there's a small seating section, most people take out. The way I'd describe the seating area is \"self maintained\". I saw on the board outside that they have mofongo, something I've recently discovered. When we go back, I'm going to try it.   Dinner options: small take out box - $7 for rice (yellow or white), beans, and choice of meat. Large take out box - $9 (or $10) for rice, beans, and choice of meat. Add other meats / toppings / sides for $1 each. They also have empanadillas (pizza, beef, chicken) and longer beef-filled things covered in plantain (name?) We got a large box w/ 2 meats, a side of plantains and the beef thing - and it was $15 for two people with plenty left over for one person's lunch. There isn't really a board that tells you this info - we just asked and then paid when we got up front. Still trying to figure it out. :P  The hubs got chicken stew (very tender, supple, flavorful) and fried pork belly. Coming from a culture that loves pork belly...let's just say we were excited. The only thing is that the pork was probably sitting out for a while and so the crispy skin was extra crispy...   I was a huge fan of the rice, beans, and plantains. I'm slowly incorporating some meat into my diet again so I tried some of the meat, but mostly stuck to the vegetarian stuff. All good. Yum."}
{"text":"I think this place is a hidden gem! I lived in Puerto Rico for many years and I have to say that the food here was spot on typical. I had the pernil or baked pork with boiled green bananas as a side. The food was tasty and a huge amount for the price paid. Overall, if you aren't to weary of the neighborhood I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the Cuban sandwich here after hearing so much hype! It's worth it! The bread was delicious--soft inside, crunchy outside. The pickles were delicious and lots of them. The ham was nice and salty with rich shredded pork. It's HUGE. This is def enough for two people to split or one very hungry person. We got sammies to go, but I really want to come back and try the prepared foods bc they the dishes look amazing, enormous and this place is very affordably priced."}
{"text":"You should never judge a book by its cover, that being said, the neighborhood in which this place is located looks pretty seedy - so watch your back when you come here! If only for the lack of palm trees outside would you not feel as though you were in a panaderia somewhere in the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico!  I have frequenting this place ever since discovering them a few years back, and while I don't usually order food, the rice & beans as well as the sandwiches are worth a try.  My personal favorite here is the Tres Leches (three milks) which is the best that I have ever had.  In addition, they have flan, and sometimes arroz con leche (rice pudding).  The prices are quite reasonable and much cheaper than your typical bakery that doesn't offer the same sort of delicacies - heck a large pressed sandwich is only $5.00. Check it out."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews I decided to go here today. It was a little hard to get to coming from the south due to all the construction on Fulton, but OMG! It was so worth it.   The place inside is not much to look at but the food was incredible.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it truly is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!  We also tried the pizza empanada. What wonderful dough it is in. And a cream cheese filled pastry.  But I am telling you, it is all about the Cuban Sandwich! Wow is it good. The other food in the case looked good and I can't wait to go back and try it."}
{"text":"Authentic? I don't know - I'm not Latin American, nor have I ever been to Puerto Rico. I'd like to think so though. Reasonably priced? Absolutely. Delicious? HELL YES.   There's not much to the exterior or interior of this little corner stop, but it just means there's that much more attention paid to the food. If Sokolowski's had a Puerto Rican counterpart, this would be it. Two ladies were alternately manning the lunch counter and pastry display, one of whom was switching off between English and Spanish like she was channel flipping on TV. Unlike Sokolowski's, the walls aren't plastered with photos and paraphernalia, and there are no shirts for sale, but there's a tiny selection of produce - which is advertised at $0.50 a piece if you buy a meal. We weren't sure whether they'd accept credit card, but they do for charges over $10.  I'm sure the ladies were laughing at me because my eyes grew huge and I all but pressed my face to the glass of the lunch counter as I took in the bounty of steaming food options. Next time I'll have to peel my eyes away and try out one of the many sandwich options, but my friend and I opted to split a dinner size ($10) Roast Pork Combo and lunch size ($8) Beef Stew Combo. All combos come with rice (white or yellow - I recommend yellow), and beans. But these aren't just any old beans. I rarely ever get beans at Chipotle, but if they made them like Caribe does, soaked in savory juice and boiled with hearty potatoes, I probably would get them 100% of the time. If I could have, I would've tried some of the Pork Ribs, Empanadas, Mofongo, or Platains as well - but that's for next time!  We couldn't leave Caribe BAKE Shop without trying a dessert, so we topped off our already full stomachs with a serving of Tres Leches. It was spongy, cinnamon-y, and appropriately moist without being too soggy. Their other signature dessert, the Tembleque (a sort of coconut pudding), had already sold out by lunch time - plan accordingly, but don't fret if the glucose craving is real, because they have plenty of other desserts to spare.  The majority of customers purchase their food to go, but there's four chairs split amongst two family-sized dining tables. Which means you're welcome to stay and eat as long as you don't bring a crowd."}
{"text":"Solid food....you know what your going to get.......glad I live close!   - Always a friendly staff - Plenty of good food and cheap (Cubano, empanadas and fried bananas are tops) - very quick....good for an after work stop  Closes fairly early...that's the only downside"}
{"text":"Today was one more day of rain, then heat and humidity that is ruining the short summer season of Cleveland. I was rather grumpy as I watched a repeat of Rachel Ray spending $40 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Flash! I may not be in San Juan but I can eat like I am. I headed to Caribe and bought lunch for far less than Rachel paid several years ago for hers.   I do not know how many years I have been coming here. It was a bakery that made roast pork sandwiches on Saturdays. Today it is far less bakery and much more Puerto Rican hot food. Roast pork, beef stew, roast chicken, pork chops in creole sauce, rice and beans fill trays on a steam table. Sandwiches are prepared to order and include a Cuban and a two foot long roast pork. Puerto Rican food is not spicy but highly flavorful. It is like Southern soul food on vacation.   I am always confused when I come here. Somehow it all works out and I take my order to a formica table on the other side of the room. This is not a dive for lacking any attempt to provide the diner with ambiance or decor. This is like the lobster pounds in Maine or the grouper shacks in Florida. You take your food to a table and the food is the reason you are here. If you prefer you can do as most do and get your food to go.   The long loaves of soft crusted bread, the tropical frozen ices and the flan are all exceptional. I have had every thing on the menu and eating here makes me glad immigrants retain their cultures."}
{"text":"Best cuban sandwich i have ever had! I ordered the small size but it was a very large portion. Make sure to take home some fresh bread its delicious"}
{"text":"Yum!! I love this place!! It's not in a 'desirable location', but please do not judge the place by the outside appearance.  Their food is so good!  The Alcapurria are amazing (just try one...seriously)...empanadas yum!! Rice & beans and stewed chicken oh...and fried plantains...everything is on point! The prices are low. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I saw a fellow Yelper post a picture of their food from here and it looked so good I decided to find this place and try it out for myself. I had some trouble finding it, actually drove past it, and it doesn't appear to be located in the best area, but once I made it inside I was greeted by warm and friendly staff. The young lady working there helped me figure out what everything was at this buffet/cafeteria like set up, and she even let me get samples of a couple different dishes in my to-go box.   The food: Yellow Rice with Chickpeas, Fried Sweet Plantains, Beans with Pork, Steak, Pork, Pizza Empanadillas, Alcapuria Deguineo (fried ball with ground meat and plantains). - I found the food to be a little salty, lacking vegetables, and it did not have any memorable flavor to it.   BUT! I think if you enjoy Latin cuisine then you should definitely check this place out because although I personally did not think it was amazing, the food was still good, AND they give you huge portions, AND it's cheap since my bill was only $10, AND the staff is super great. I would give this place another shot to  try some of the other stuff they offer."}
{"text":"I make a hour drive anytime for there awesome FOOD.  Home cook Puertorican food!!   *****Stars"}
{"text":"This place seriously rocks.  The Sammies are all good, the Cuban really stands out.  I would recommend getting there bit earlier as the were sold out of many of the dishes I was craving. The rice and beans are to die for.  I had a couple renditions of the beef stew and they were excellent.    The food is served cafeteria style, but they have a dining room on the other side. The food is super authentic and the service was very friendly. You do not have to get the combination platters, they will sell you just the main dishes if you wish.  Welcome to flavor town!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the bakery section but the food section is amazing. Tons of greasy, delicious goodness staring you in the face. I just go for the empanadillas, but I've had their rice and roast pork which are mouthwatering. Their beans were very runny when I had them. I have yet to try anything else but it all looks amazing.  Service is simple and friendly. You walk up to the counter, point or say the food you want, they box it up, and you pay. Any time I had questions about the food, they were happy to assist.  They have a dining area, but the place is definitely intended for takeout."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but the Employees have nasty attitudes. When buying the food per pound, the price changes from one day to the next, usually increasing, depending on who serves you. If you don't speak Spanish your in trouble. You have to wait for the one or two people who do speak English to find out what your ordering because there are no signs, in English, telling you what it is. When I questioned the price, bc it had increased from the previous week, the employee had an attitude, and told me to wait for the next person to serve me then and threw down my container and walked away, so I left. Not spending my money at a place with bad service and attitudes. My  friend said there's hair in her food every time she has gone there. I hadn't experienced that, but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard that the empenadas were wonderful. That's what led me here.  There is no signage, so I actually drove by at first. It's cafeteria style but I saw the empenadas right as I entered, in a separate warmer. The line was haphazard, so I just tried to make eye contact with one of the employees. After only a minute, I was able to place my order. I had cash, so it went quickly. I took it to go, so I'm not sure how the seating area is. But i was not steered wrong. These are the best empenadas in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait for 1 sandwhich is longer than expected. Its still good, but faster wait time would be nice. I waited more than 15 minutes for sandwhich. The new building is nice. They have 2 lines now which is silly because you dont get served any faster. There were at least 8 of us waiting for food that wasnt on the line already. It came out in 2 big groups. So half left and the other half kept waiting. When a sandwhich order is ready it should be given to the customer, not wait around for 3 more orders to finish. Efficiency ovbiously isnt a strong point here."}
{"text":"Thought I'd check out the new building. Food was still authentic and good, but take it to go. The seating area is dirty and cold. Woman's room busted, the Men's room filthy, no towels and a \"present\" was left in the non-working toilet. Floors are vintage terrazzo, I can only guess they built this new cinder block building on the foundation of an old store from the 1940s. If they would just clean and buff the floor they would be so great again. The Cubano sandwich is their best thing going ... the chicharones were cold and tough. Pastries were well made and delicious. Staff behind the counter were very helpful and friendly.  IMO ... you can judge the cleanliness of a non-open kitchen (or beer lines) by how clean the bathrooms are."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good but the meats could have used more flavor.  Also, at least one bathroom would be a nice amenity if serving food and having tables available."}
{"text":"We love Caribe Bake Shop for their empanadas, Cuban sandwiches, fried bananas, chicharrones, fried stuff yuccas, .... basically everything.   We have been eating here for over 20 years and the flavors and quality is still as good as the day we first tried it!    What's great about their food, it's delicious hot, eaten right away in their cafe seating area OR COLD right out of the fridge for a midnight snack!! It's Delicious no matter how you eat it!"}
{"text":"This place is fast becoming my favorite drop in restaurant for authentic Puerto Rican food. Ordered chicharron with yellow rice, pork and beans and tostones. The chicharrons were perfectly fried and crunchy, the yellow rice was delicious. The pork and beans was a little under seasoned but the sweetness of the tostones balanced out the taste. You'll get three different meal sizes with prices ranging from $6-$12. Lunch comes with a soft drink as well. Going to try the Cuban sandwich next time I visit."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that only cooks/chefs of Caribbean decent can make a proper Cubano sandwich and this place nails it!  This is  a textbook hole-in-the-wall with great food.  Seems to be mostly take-out, but there are some tables inside.  Don't let the outside appearance of the building fool you (it's rough)- but wonderful flavors of the Caribbean at a nice price await inside!!"}
{"text":"We were craving a Cubano sandwich having just returned home from Florida. This was the Best Ever!  Big chunks of juicy pork, tender ham slices, fresh pressed bread, perfect pickles , melted cheese, and mustard sauce. And the small sandwich is huge.    If you are not familiar with area then it's going to look a little rundown on outside. You may not even thinks it's open. But be prepared for some of the finest food you can fathom though that door."}
{"text":"I lived in Miami before coming to Cleveland and thank god for this place. Cuban sandwich and sweet plantains and I'm in heaven. The prices are criminally cheap and a small sandwich was enough for lunch and dinner for me. The staff is super friendly too. I can't wait to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"Their Cubano is probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and the portion is huge. The staff is always super friendly"}
{"text":"It feels like you have stepped into Puerto Rico. This is the real deal.  Go for the empanadas & relleno de papa.  I speak no Spanish so I just point to what I want and the ladies just smile at me.  Great prices, tasty authentic food."}
{"text":"Legit! A great place got even better with the new makeover. I'm here to bring assurance that the food is still amazing! I come here for the Cuban sandwiches. They are so good that every time I tell myself to order something different (just for variety), I simply cannot. To my credit, I have accompanied it with rice, beans and the incredible chicharrones - so those items are confirmed delicious. Great prices for genuine Latin American food."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious! Definitely a gem in an unknown part of town. We had an assortment of food and ate more than anticipated. Check out the rice, beans, pulled pork, BBQ pork skewer, or fried potato ball (unfortunately I didn't get their authentic names) and you won't regret it. Worth it and so affordable!"}
{"text":"Had a tripleta and a quesito from Caribe today.  It was hella good!  The tripleta was loaded with meats and they were tasty and fresh. The pork was delicious!  I haven't had a sandwich from here in a while and I'm not sure why. But I will make an effort to visit Caribe more often. It's kind of far from home, but worth the trip.   I really like the new store that they built. It's good to see that they're prospering.   I also bought some quesitos and they're absolutely delicious! They're sugary, flaky, fluffy, and they have some body. The creamy cheese filling is delicious. It tastes a little like cheesecake and I love it!  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give a real review, but I never got to try the food. My husband and I were in Cleveland this Friday and we've been meaning to try out this place since I heard they had morcilla. I knew it was late so I called ahead to check what time they closed, and was told 8:00 p.m. We arrived at 7:40 p.m. and the doors were locked. As we peered in the window to make sure there was no mistake, the people inside turned off the \"Open\" sign and began to collect the steaming hot food from the trays. That pissed me off, but it's okay because we still got some good food at the Dominican place a few blocks away. I don't think I'll come back, which is a shame because they could have made a ton of money from this pregnant lady who has zero impulse control when she's hungry."}
{"text":"Barbacoa is delicious and a very generous portion too. Many other worthy choices also. Watch their hours."}
{"text":"I visited after reading Dick S.'s review.  Good gravy, man, this place is amazing!  If you've ever been to lovely Puerto Rico, you are likely pining for a piragua or some of those insanely good, fried pockets of glory.  If you haven't been,  go to this bakery anyway.  The staff is really nice and friendly, and will explain and describe all their offerings. The food is authentic and made with a lot of care.    For the love of God, please try the rice pudding."}
{"text":"Cleveland has a large Puerto Rican population and it is a shame there are not many options for good Latin food outside of Rincon Criollo, Quisqueya La Bella and Caribe. Most Puerto Rican people that I speak with prefer to cook at home. I am glad that Caribe exists for a quick fix of Caribbean cuisine. The food here is delicious and affordable. There is a heated food buffet that includes beef stew, sausage, pork, beans and rice among other options. You can specify if you would like a small or large container. I opted for a small serving of yellow rice and beans with beef stew and a Cuban sandwich. This order could have served a family of four and was around 9 dollars. The pork in the Cuban was a little dry late in the day although I came about an hour before closing. It was a great sandwich. The beef stew was excellent and I highly recommend it. The empanadillas are filling and could be a standalone meal. I ate some of the meal inside and took the rest with me. I stepped outside on the corner of Seymour Ave and Fulton and couldn't help but wonder why Charles Ramsey would have opted to eat at the McDonald's on Clark if he lived down the street from Caribe?"}
{"text":"O...M...G  Don't judge a book by its cover. That's all I am going to say.  I was looking for a place that wasn't going to eat up my wallet, but at the same time give me my money's worth. This place met my criteria. It's definitely not the fancy, lavish place...extremely rough around the edges. The menu is not the best or even really available, but luckily I kind of had an idea what to order by reading the reviews on Yelp before going. When I walked up to the counter, the only thing I said was \"I wanted the special with the rice and beans with a choice of meat\" she said okay and told me the different kinds of meats they had. I opted for the beef stew. Let me tell you, I got my ten bucks worth! Just watching her pile on the rice, beans and meat in the container...I'm just thinking, I don't need all that (whew).   I was going to sit down and eat but it was so freaking hot inside (no air conditioner) and I felt kind of bad for the employees. So I just ended up taking it home.   Finally got home and I just wanted to get a taste of it and hold off until dinner time. I just found myself standing in my kitchen, taking one bite after another. Very good...everything seasoned just right...just wow!  Very delicious...I repeat, very freaking delicious!  It will definitely last another day...that's how much they give you.  Highly recommended!!!"}
