{"text":"Steer clear! We visited the restaurant for the Jay Z concert - worst dining experience I've ever had. Our server flipped a switch when the concert began and berated us for standing in an area where everyone else was watching the show. Demanded that we pay the bill (while the show was happening) or he would \"kick us out\". Manager was of no help and did not seem to care, but did allow us to return to where the rest of the crowd was. Funny enough, we did not see anyone else get asked to move. Not sure what set him off as he seemed stable before the show started.   We wrote a complaint to the senior manager of the restaurant (first time I have ever done anything like this), who, to be fair, was quick to get in touch with us. However the conversation was a big waste of time as it consisted of a very wishy-washy apology preceded by generous amounts of blame deflection. She did offer to comp our meal on our next visit, but we declined as we were not happy with the way any of them handled the situation - basically called us liars without actually saying it. I assume the comp'd meal offer was just to get us to drop our complaint.  The senior manager actually mentioned that the server we had problems with had had other issues with guests before - that people either \"loved or hated him\". Yet, he is still employed and still has a terrible attitude. Shows what kind of standards this place has. I also found out after the fact that my girlfriend had a very similar experience with the very same server and manager on a prior visit.   Save your money and your  sanity - eat/drink before you go to the game/concert/etc. The Air Canada Club restaurant is a big waste of time.  Quick points: - Food is about the quality of Jack Astors but with the prices doubled and up. - If you aren't an Air Canada Club member, you will not receive seats with a view of the show, even if you purchased restaurant seating. It's expected that you remain at your table (and listen... I guess?). This was confirmed by the senior manager. Expect to be treated as if you were a nuisance. - Rules of the restaurant are very vague and ambiguous. Not even the senior manager was able to explain them with confidence. If you decide to go, check with the staff so you don't end up like us. - Avoid the Calamari"}
{"text":"This is the best place to watch a Raptors game if you have the hook up to get tickets. You are sitting with a great view, full service bar, food, and tons more leg room than your usual space during Raptors games.  The prices here are ridiculous of course because it IS the ACC but hey...you are here for the game anyways right?"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and always an exciting experience at the Air Canada Club to watch NBA and NHL games while enjoying one of the best meals in downtown Toronto!   Playoffs were incredible, but the experience that the staff at the ACClub made it even that much better! Go Raptors Go!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick dessert before a concert or game.  Carrot cake was delicious with pineapple piece to make it interesting.  Sorbets were nice with mango being the favourite.  A little pricey but what do you expect from ACC.   Sat at the bar and were well taken care of. Very friendly bartenders to make sure everything was well taken care of.  4.5 stars as it served its purpose and a nice spot to hang out for an hour."}
{"text":"We came here on Monday October 5th for the Madonna concert. This upscale restaurant had a warm ambiance and a great view overlooking the stage. I believe the access to the restaurant is only granted to people who had event tickets with Air Canada Club access. We didn't stay at the restaurant to watch the show, we went to our seats. I may be wrong but it seems that guests are able stay there for the show. The restaurant takes on the sound from the stage. Closer to show time, there was a dj spinning in the back of the stage making it hard to carry a conversation with the group.  The menu list was small but there was a good variety. They focused on sophisticated comfort food with a mix of Italian, American, and even sushi was an appetizer option. Check out my photos for the entire menu.  My order (Photos attached) - Potato and bacon soup (Soup of the day)  - Braised lamb shank with kale, pickled cherries and celery root - We shared 3 desserts with the group  I had no serious issues with the food since it all tasted great. The lamb was complimented well with the kale although the presentation can be improved. The portion size was decent - not too big or small except for the special of the day fish, which seemed a smaller relative to the other dishes. I believe the special fish was also around $40, which at that price, the lamb is more worthwhile. Everyone else also enjoyed their dish at my table.   The prices are fair given the environment and quality of the food. It is a nice place to treat clients and to spoil yourself or others for a special occasion."}
