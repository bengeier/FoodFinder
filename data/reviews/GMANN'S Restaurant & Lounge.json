{"text":"already closed by order of the leasing company, took forever to open in the first place.  Had the wrong theme for the location. Did some cosmetic changes to the old Weathervane but kept the same crappy falling apart tables and chairs"}
{"text":"On Wednesday November 21st ,my wife and I went back to Gmanns. We went to here the group Nostalgic. Gene had Cornbeef and Cabbage on the menu for a special. I love good Cornbeef and Cabbage, belive me this was not just good it was fantastic. The Cornbeef was melt in your mouth. It was so tender you could cut wih a fork. I was so impressed that before left that night I went a head and saved a table for next Wednesday. If you like Cornbeef and Cabbage, check out Gmanns on a Wednesday night and stay for a great show.

{"text":"If you like slow service, being ignored, bad karaoke, and even worse food this is the place for you. We left 15 minutes ago and went through the drive through at Arby's. The decor is cute that's what the one star is for.  The steak ($22.00) was maybe 1/4 inch thick and had a kind of fish taste to it like they are cooking fish and beef in the same area or the same pan - we call this cross contamination.   The Not yo momma's pot pie was definitely NOT my momma's. For the $11.00 we could have gone to the store and bought 4 frozen pot pies and it would have tasted better.   I asked 4 times for more sour cream for my potato - the last time the server actually chuckled because she forgot again.  All this for just under $60.00 for 2 adults and I child.  RUN in the opposite direction! Save yourselves!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service. I stopped in for lunch, approximately 12:30 on a Wednesday. The place was dead. There were three tables occupied, two of which had already eaten and were preparing to leave. The third was seated with one older couple. I was alone so that basically meant the server had all of 3 people to wait on. I sat, unacknowledged, for over 10 minutes watching her repeatedly run in and out of the kitchen or the service area, most of the time empty handed, as if she had a full house. The other couple had drinks so they had clearly already been waited on. It was incomprehensible to me what duties the server had that were so pressing she couldn't even swing by to take my beverage order. She stopped once at the other table to answer a question and then walked away, still without even looking at me. The gentleman from the seated couple got up and brought me a small newspaper, saying with a laugh, \"To give you something to do because it's looks like it's going to be a while.\" I read a story about the history of The Sundance Kid and still had not been waited on. I was one person - how long would it take for her to take my order? 60 seconds, maybe 90 at the most? When I finally saw her make bussing a table and answering the phone a priority over getting my order, I'd had enough and left for another restaurant where the servers are capable of doing more than one thing at a time. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a tuna sandwich which was a little on the dry side and the portion could have been bigger with regards to the filling of tuna itself.  Onion soup was fantastic and the cheese was authentic.  I didn't like the cheese melt as there could have been more cheese and avocado was green/bitter.  It's really spicy.  Fries were great. Service is excellent and I'm prepared to give it a few more tries."}
{"text":"Excellent midwest-style food and drink!  Good selection of choices on the menu.  Mesa has needed a friendly non-franchise restaurant  for a long time, and we were not disapointed.  Warm wood-paneled interior and we had good service."}
{"text":"Gmanns is by far the friendliest place to be, we think Fridays r the best. A place to feel right at home with all of different types, small and personal bar. A Cheers.. kinda place. Good drinks specials.. Best bartender Don !"}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I went to this place for lunch last Saturday.  The decor is nice but that is about it.  The BBQ Sand that I ordered was bland cold and dry....my husband and son split a rack of ribs and they weren't anything special.  Way too pricey for the quality of food.  The server never came back to check on anything after she delivered our food.  The ice tea had a funky taste to it I sent it back for a soda instead.  Too bad this was our second time trying this place and were disappointed both times.  They already have menu items crossed off with a sharpie.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Reading these reviews, makes me feel like I was in another restaurant!!  This place is the best restaurant to happen in Mesa in years.  I visit Mesa several times a year to visit friends.  This is the best place. I ordered a filet mignon that was incredible.  A baked potato with, butter, sour cream, chives, bacon and cheese, steamed vegtables...onion soup to die for, best ever and Tres Leche Cake...that I will have again!!!  This doesn't include great entertainment by the owner and dancing waitresses.  Gmanns is a new favorite in my book"}
