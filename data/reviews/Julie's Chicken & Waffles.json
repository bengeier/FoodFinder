{"text":"Dining out is about more than just the food! 

Took a 20 min. drive to try this restaurant because I had a coupon, and wanted to see what chicken and waffles was all about. We went early Sunday, about 5pm and were the only patrons in the place. There are two doors to enter-the first gets you into a vestibule which, sadly, set the tone for our experience. There was some construction related materials (bucket and cords) just laying there! Really! Why would you leave those there? We were taken to a window seat with a view of the parking lot in one direction and behind us a hallway to the kitchen with a trash can and a vacuum cleaner sitting there in full view. Wall, table and room decor is non-existent. Do they just not see what their customers are seeing?

We ordered the chicken breast and waffle and enjoyed both. The chicken was nicely seasoned, nice and crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, not at all greasy, and was a good sized portion. The waffle was good too. Our side of greens was okay-not much flavor and floating in a lot of water.

The service was very attentive, and our server showed us around the rest of the restaurant where they have a bar and showroom-they bring in comedians, musicians and a DJ on selected nights. It looks to have a great layout for shows.

When I have guests in my home for dinner, the very least I do is clean up! Julie's ought top do the same, and while they are at it, add a little decor to make the experience more inviting."}
{"text":"Friend told me about this new spot that just opended in Mesa, called Julies Chicken & Waffles. Two of my Favorite words!! So, after getting the doo done, myself and another friend decided to check it out for lunch. Now, let me start by saying, this is a very NEW establishment. I didn't want to compare them to LoLos or Roscoe's. We walk in, its a really nice set up. We wait mmmm, about 20 mins for them to bring up two really yummy sweet potato corn muffins, served in a little paper french fry boat, w/2 pats of butter and one knife and fork... for the two of us? No extra napkin or plate. We just kind of looked at each other on that. Had to ASK for a extra set. I ordered the Red Beans & Rice (Rice was watery, Beans had no taste ), Collard Greens (Dam! Again, no flavor or taste), 3 really good sized wings (Only ate one of them) Again, No TASTE! They have a nice dance floor, for old school music, a bar and lounge in the front of the establishment as well. The owner was the cook and waitres. That may have been the reason, not that much attention was paid to the SEASONING of the food. Think I'll go back next time with The Man during the evenings festivities. And give it a 2nd chance. But, for now, I'm giving it a 2/Star for the Potential. Its in a great little spot. They have pretty much the same menu as Lolos, just not as good. They may want to check out the Draft House Chicken. They have the fricking best chicken in PHOENIX!  The owever was very polite and attentive, it just didnt resonate to the bland tasting food.  Im going back in a month.  They've only been open a month.  Their food on avg was about $2-$3 more than Lolos, for same menu items.

BTW The wrong address came up, I went to their NEW? Location

on to the review...
 they dont open till Noon on Sundays and not till1pm on weekdays i believe..which i think is a little late, they could probably get more of a crowd if they opened a little bit earlier buuttt i dont own the place so wth am I ?? Outside it can be deceiving but inside it is a very large restaurant. They have two dining areas, a bar area, and dance floors as well. Speakers all over the place also. Apparently on Fridays 10-4am it is going to be a little club atmosphere with food ?? They have brunch on Sundays with complimentary mimosas( we were the only ones in the whole place till we left so we finished damn near a whole pitcher ... don't judge us :) we ordered fried okra, mac n cheese, rice n beans a breast and waffle dish and a 3 piece thigh and waffle dish. The okra was great, the beans and rice were pretty blah and sadly the mac n cheese was just mediocre.(i am a mac n cheese whore so i think i have a hand up in that category and it just did not tantalize my taste buds). Lover got the thighs and he liked my breast more (i totally could take that sentence to a different topic but im staying on food). The waffles were pretty good.  

Now i am a girl who loves Roscoe's as well as LoLo's and i might have to give Julie's another chance to see if really match up. Julies is much closer to my house and would love to have a place like this that i loved but im not in love just yet. You know if i ever fell if i change my 3 star rating."}
