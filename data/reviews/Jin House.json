{"text":"I see that a lot of reviewers have given this place 5 stars and it looks like many of them ate the sushi.  So, I will qualify this review by stating that we did not get Sushi so that may indeed be wonderful.  We just wanted some delicious Chinese take-out food and after trying some of the other options in the Amherst, Ohio area, we really had not found anything we felt was great.  So, we tried Jin House and were underwhelmed with the basics of General Tso's chicken, Fried Rice and Egg Rolls.  If you are a Sushi fan it sounds like you'll fare better."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  Lemon Chicken was so thin and over fried it looked like bacon. Service was slow and could of cared less about their customers. 
I have had better Chinese in the mall food court"}
{"text":"I have been looking for an affordable place for great sushi and this place has it. Fresh and a great price. The staff was helpful with all of my questions. Will go here for now on when I want Chinese of Japanese food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jin house is great. Every time I've been the sushi is fantastic. 
Yes the Sushi Chef is stone faced, but who cares his rolls are dope.
A cozy place so get there early."}
{"text":"Hibachi Chicken is FANTASTIC!  It could easily feed a family of 3."}
{"text":"My husband & I just moved to Ohio from Hawaii. We love our sushi! It has been really hard to find good sushi here in OH. Most of them has a previously frozen taste on there fish it's just not comparable to HI fresh catch sushi. Or most places are just way to over price for sushi. Jin house, has great tasting sushi & for the right price. We will be def. Coming back for more :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place more and more everytime I come here. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. I always order some sort of sushi, and it's always delicious and presented beautifully. I come here every monday. Even when it gets really busy (and I mean lines of people forming waiting to be seated) I've never had to stand around more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! Everything my Mom and I had was good. The Hot & Sour soup is to die for!! I had the Mo Po Tofu, and my Mom had the Curry Chicken. 
Everything was reasonably priced, well seasoned, good portion sizes and just.. Yum!! The place was SUPER busy too, but not we were not kept waiting! So many take out orders, and all the seats were full. 
I hope to come back and try the sushi the next time I visit my Mom!"}
{"text":"Great place! I take my mother here frequently. I recommend the California Crunch sushi roll."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food here, and the service is always good.  However, I do have a problem with servers wearing caps (baseball and bucket style), and having their pants hanging so low that their underwear is showing.  That is totally inappropriate attire at any place of employment and especially at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat sushi because raw fish makes me want to instantly gag but I had the angry roll which has asparagus,  tempura shrimp, crab, tempura topping etc on it. The taste was amazing and left me wanting more. I'll definitely go there again to try a different roll. The inside is clean, a row of tables on each side. In the open next to the register there is a man who makes sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's quirky and attentive.
We tried it for the first time last night. They were very busy, all tables full and lots of take away. 
We were seated in a timely manner and quickly had our drink order taken. 
We had at least 3 members of the staff check in and take our orders. 
We ordered sushi for an app, they brought them all out on the same plate. Thats nice since it's all together and eliminates a lot of excess plates on a small table.
The dinner portions are enormous! Very plentiful and tasty. They come with soup and egg roll. 
They don't put pork in the fried rice so that's perfect for me (vegetarian). Since I couldn't eat the soup the server said he would bring me two egg rolls, so sweet. 
All in all we loved it and made a point to grab a menu. We are more than happy to travel from Elyria to get takeaway or dine in."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best asian food on the far west side. The yellow tail and tempura roll are among the best I have ever in had, Including many MUCH more expensive places downtown like Sushi Rock-"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Food is always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Prices are very reasonable for bad food... Let alone delicious food! The atmosphere inside is comfortable and the service is always pleasant. I have been going there for over a year and haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Do not order by number from the menu. They will ask you what item it is instead. Parking lot lights are out so it is very dark. Restaurant has what looks like old McDonalds booths for dining in and some seating around a breakfast bar type place near the register. Busy place! Staff was friendly and quick to help us. Food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken large size and it was enough to feed four people. I would give it 5 stars if some fruits and veggies (pineapple, green peppers) are added to the dish and the parking lot was lit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I have been here a number of times and have never had to wait to be seated. The staff is friendly, quick and pay attention to you- they have never messed up a single order! 

I always get the vegetable lo mein - their portions are incredible and very filling! Overall, you can't have a bad time here!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese,Japanese fare. My family loves the sushi and we have never had a bad meal here. What impresses me the most is the fresh ingredients they use for every dish. My favorite is the hot and sour soup. Not terribly spicy but, oh my, the flavors!"}
{"text":"Best food in Amherst and a great value. Get the Wasabi, wow that will clear up your cold!"}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good things about Jin's and finally got to try it. 

Food was good.  Service was good.  

Just make sure you get any egg rolls you order early on.  We were done with our meal when we realized we never got them.  So, I asked they be taken off the bill.  Apparently, they couldn't cause they were apart of the meal (but really weren't), so alright...just give them to me to take home.  

The manager confirms with me that we ordered them.  She verified.  Then some kid from the back runs out and ask if he delivered them to us, and I say \"no.\"  Our server then brings us one egg roll.  I said \"ok\" but we ordered two.  She checks her order pad again and says \"yes, you did,  do you want me to get another one?\"  Laughing,  I say \"no\" and walk out.  I'm referring to this as \"RollGate\".

I don't understand restaurants that don't want to give customers what they pay for, especially when it costs them like $.50.  Needless to say, we will probably not go again. 

I'm still on the hunt for good Chinese on the West Side."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok at best. The cuts of fish were very sloppy and inconsistent. The positive was that it had good taste. They weren't fishy and they tasted different from each other. The rolls I had were good. I had hoped I was ordering rolls that were not cooked but that wasn't the case. Good place for Ohio."}
{"text":"Average American Chinese food. Sushi is surprisingly decent. Attitude of the servers could be a little bit better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat Asian food. They have 25 different kinds of sushi! The ones I've tried are delicious. I usually get the sweet and sour chicken and it is a good portion. I would recommend the white tuna roll. The staff is very friendly and they are very helpful. Great service."}
{"text":"Their lunch special was a great deal and their service was phenomenal. A man was extremely nice and opened the door for me before I walked in right away he asked if I had an order to go and checked on it immediately. On my way out, as my hands were full, another man who cashed me out did the same and even got me a drink for my 5 min longer than anticipated wait since I came a little early to pick up my food.

Their sashimi lunch special was up to my standard except for the salmon but maybe cuz I left it out for a few hours, everything else was exactly what I wanted. It came with the classic miso soup (so good) and salad (plain lettuce but what do you expect). Also had one of their special rolls and was up to par when compared a decent to good sushi restaurant. 

My friend got the chicken hibachi lunch and 2 vegetable spring rolls for only $9.15 and he was more than happy with the food.

5 star service, 4 to 4.5 star food, maybe I was hungry but regardless I was more than satisfied. Will definitely return if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places of sushi i have ever gone to we order the love boat on my anniversary and we were happy we decided to make it a tradition to come always on that day. Great taste great service its quick only thing is the size of the plAce but hopefully one day they will expand finger crossed haha"}
{"text":"My nine year old who is the pickiest eater loves this place and eats here once a week! The sushi is amazing! I enjoy the salmon or chicken hibachi.  The service is the best ever!!"}
{"text":"My experience was terrible. Waiter was uninterested and reeked of \"I don't care\". Food took 25 minutes to come out and the place had little business at the time. Messed up my wife's order. Both dishes ordered were the Chinese lunch specials and were not good at all .A person that I believe may have been the owner was yelling loudly in the kitchen at the kitchen help.

Even after voicing displeasure at our meals to the waiter, he didn't say a word. The $15.67 spent was a culinary disaster."}
{"text":"They barely answer the phone and when they do wait times are terrible.  Food is good but not that good."}
{"text":"My encounter with this establishment was...how you say a pleasure.  I was welcomed by a peculiar African-American whose hat was not even of an asian variety. I doubted this restaurant's authenticity untill i heard the distinct yelling of what i assumed to be an upset asian - american business owner. I waited approximately 10 minutes until my spicy tuna roll was finished and i have to say, my my it was quite the treat. It was also within my budget during these hard economic times. Overall i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance of the foul fish smell and the loud pans clanking beyond the counter. I plan in returning in the near future. 4 stars"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Prices were good. Portions were generous. Our party thoroughly enjoyed themselves. 
Our server was polite and friendly. Every bit as good as the reviews led me to believe."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  Very generous portions.   Wont get chicken and broccoli any where but here !"}
{"text":"The food a year ago was just ok. Last week my sweet and sour chicken meal was very good. We got it to go."}
{"text":"Today I can honestly say that I'm only ordering sushi from here only...today I ordered the hibachi chicken and my mom ordered the orange chicken. My hibachi chicken was very dry and my mom's orange chicken was let's just say more breading than chicken. We had to shout at servers for anything else that we needed. Phone orders they need someone just to do that alone because you are on hold longer then it takes to eat your food. Now note I will go back but only for sushi and wonton soup the rest nope"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Wow, I can't believe a place like this is in Amherst- the AK47 and volcano rolls are delicious and expertly prepared, and the Japanese dishes are excellent.
The only thing that keeps this place from being another star higher is that the Chinese food they sell is basic, greasy-spoon Chinese. I had to double check that it came from Jin House and not a generically-named hole-in-the-wall.
Lesson learned: don't order Chinese from a Japanese place."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi that I've ever had. I have recently moved to strongsville & have been to Shinto & Sakura & they don't compare. It's definitely worth the drive. The food has always been fresh. Their menu choices are extensive from sushi, Chinese, & hibachi. Their soups are also delicious. Actually between my best friends, husband & I, we have been there countless times, gotten a lot of different things & it's all been awesome! 

Jin & his wife Lynn are the owners & they are both in there every time we go, working to make sure everything is great."}
{"text":"Very limited seating. However the servers are very polite and attentive. The food is great. My go to order is the california crunch roll and their amazing fried rice. Wish they would upgrade to a bigger location and offer delivery."}
{"text":"Love this place! sushi is good, edamame is great and I love the sweet n sour chicken! Make sure if you get a large dinner you have someone to share it with, it is a ton of food!  Only thing I have not liked is the miso soup, it's way too fishy tasting. And get carryout if possible, very small inside. My favorite \"fast food\" place."}
{"text":"They have the best food!!  Great service, your order is always correct when you pick up to go, very friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE coming to Jin House. I can honestly say it is the best place around for Asian food. The service is always great and attentive, the owner is always present and checking on guests, and the food is always made perfectly. I will be a lifelong patron of this amazing place."}
{"text":"Great sushi lunch specials. Generally pretty quick service."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of sushi, and we recently spent over a month eating it in Japan. While I won't pretend that this rivals Tokyo sushi, it was quite fresh and good. The service was attentive, and we were able to get in and out quickly. They were even nice enough to fill up our water bottles for our continued journey."}
{"text":"Dont tip your servers here they dont get the tips they get paid minimum wage or a little higher and they have to give all there tips to the owners!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Massive portions, fast and friendly, loved our meal. Waiter takes time to  talk with you."}
{"text":"Ordered: Hibachi Steak Lunch

Ambiance: Typical small sushi shop with a small sushi bar that seats maybe 6 people and multiple tables and benches along the wall. The place was very clean and service was pretty friendly.

Food: The hibachi itself was excellent with perfectly seared beef which were moist and tender to the bite. The vegetables were cooked but still had a firm texture to them. All of this was tossed in a soy-based sauce and served with a side of your choice of rice vs fried rice. My only nitpick was the miso soup which I can't quite pin down but I think the brighter broth and green onions give it a distinctly chinese flavor. The edamame were also unsalted which is simply a matter of preference for most people.

Overall I enjoyed my meal and thought it was prepared very well. I wouldn't mind coming back here to explore their menu."}
{"text":"Super Loud on the inside and when I went to pay for my pickup order, they won't take American Express.    I called at 8:15 and was told 20 minutes to pickup.  When I got there at 8:30, the food was not even started yet.  

I ended up canceling my order and going somewhere else for dinner.  The staff at the register were pretty rude as well.  I have given them several chances and half of the time I am disappointed in some way."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese place in the Amherst area! We love all their lunch and dinner specials as well as their sushi."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You will not find better prices considering the quality of the food and the portions. 

My go to is the hibachi chicken and shrimp with white rice. I get take out from here all the time, easily the best restaurant in the area. 

The inside is kind of small, but their great food and friendly staff makes up for it. They also have comfortable booths."}
{"text":"I have been going twice a month for about 8 months now and have always had great food and good experience.  Best place around for sushi.  This is my fav restaurant, hands down."}
{"text":"Been here many time.  Always good.  Great value. Great quality. Extensive menu.  Sushi is best in the county.  This place is my go to sushi."}
{"text":"QUICKLY becoming the best Asian hot spot in the area.   Call ahead as seating is limited and a LINE awaits you!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service. I went there for lunch and you get a lot of food for a great price. No complaints at all. One of the better chinese/japanese restaurants around this area."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi around. The rolls are excellent. Highly recommend spider roll, shrimp tempura, and California Crunch. 

Excellent food."}
{"text":"We live in Elyria and usually eat at Golden ginger and number 1 kitchen. This place knocked those out! This will definitely be our place for chinese! Was seated and order drink n food in a good few minutes. Portions are huge if order small but so worth it!"}
{"text":"You may pass by his place without even knowing it since they are located in a small strip mall.  The seating is very limited and they turn tables over fast.   Service is excellent and everyone was sweet and kind.  The menu is extensive and includes Chinese and Japanese cuisine.

I started out with the wonton soup which was tasty, but served too hot.   I had to set it aside to cool down and before I got a chance to eat it, they brought our entrees.   I find that super annoying as I want to enjoy my soup and then move onto my entree.   We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Cashew Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein.   The Lo Mein was fantastic!   All the food came out hot and steamy.   The lo mein was full of flavor and a super choice.   The Kung Pao was just ok, as it wasn't spicy enough and therefore not flavorful.  The cashew chicken was very bland and not a good choice for  us.

What I didn't like, and it's because the place is so small, is that when people are waiting for take out orders they just stand in front of your table.   Awkward to have a conversation with people standing right next to you."}
{"text":"Just went the other day for lunch with my husband when I first walked into the building to me there wasn't enough seating it's very small the menu is very confusing. I ordered the Hibachi steak and white rice with an egg roll and wonton soup for the most part the soup and the egg rolls were delicious The Hibachi steak was good but the steak was a little tough so that's why I'm giving it 2 Stars but I will definitely give Jin House another try."}
{"text":"Delicious food, miso soup is amazing. We go at least once a week. Definitely a keeper, nvr disappointed. Staff is super friendly, its usually has a good amount of customers dining in but haven't experienced a long wait time for a table. Although I perfer the bar seat so I can watch the sushi be made to order."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and finally tried it my last visit home. I currently live in California so I will call myself somewhat of a sushi snob. This place did not disappoint! We ordered carry-out and it was sooo good! I tried a little bit of everything and loved it all. 

They have great prices too! When we walked in to pick-up our order it was very crowded and their is not much room for seating. I'm glad we chose to do carry-out.  If you like sushi, this is the best place around for miles. I can't wait to get it again next time I'm in Ohio. Thank heavens they finally put a sushi place in Amherst!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite a bit for lunch.
Great lunch specials.
Some of the best Sushi I have had in the Cleveland area. 
Love the wonton soup and egg rolls-both seem to be home made, which is always a win in my book."}
{"text":"First time coming here and waited for a extra 20 min after my husband got his food to get mine. The portions of rice are much smaller then the dinner platters. And since sitting down for about a half hour we still havnt gotten our drinks refilled.  While waiting for my food that was about 25 min late the waitress never come back to the table to apologize or say my food was on the way."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The price is good. The combination is a great deal, I love the egg rolls. I could rate this place higher if I was happy with the delivery but, Im really not! They deliver sometimes, there is no rhyme or reason and no set schedule of when they will take delivery orders.  One must call to find out if they will delivery every time! I could call every week same time, same day and most times it a no!  I hate that if I want Jin house I cant call up and get it delivered unless it happens to be a fluke. I tip very well and I make a point to always order 20-25$ of delivery to make sure and still Im disappointed. I would rather drive to another city  than drive down to the location when its busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Chinese food. We are relatively new to the area and we are eager to find a Chinese restaurant that we like. A friend recommended Jin and I am glad he did. 

The restaurant is pretty small (only 7 or 8 booths and two small tables) and is located in a strip mall. We ordered wonton soup, hot and sour soup, chicken Lo Mein, Kung Pao chicken (all of which were excellent) and chicken and cashew (which was just OK). Everything was served hot! 

The service was excellent. The price is reasonable. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"After a brief stint of living in Richmond, Virginia, I came to be OBSESSED with a little spot called Hibachi Express: all the flavor and quantity of hibachi, but without the theatrics, time or cash investment. Ever since, I've been on the hunt for something similar in Northeast Ohio. There are hibachi places, yes, but they're expensive. Jin House is the closest thing to Hibachi Express, if only it were closer to Westlake! They give you an OBSCENE amount of food (hibachi, veggies, rice, miso soup, and edamame), the prices are unbeatable, the place is adorable and always busy, and the food is definitely good -- above average. I highly recommend grabbing a big ol' brown bag of Jin House takeout."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying my wife and I really like the food here. The negative aspects of the dining experience have little to do with the quality of the food (a note on this later). The purpose of this review is not to warn people about this place because, like I said, the food is really tasty. It's to offer constructive criticism to management from former restaurant workers to make dining in a lot more pleasant.

---

I don't know the name of the person who first waited on us. This isn't because I didn't remember--it's because she never introduced herself. The first thing she said after the host gave us our menus was \"do you know what you want to drink?\" followed a minute later by \"do you know what you want to eat?\" She, along with the other people who checked in on us throughout dinner, was pleasant, but obviously clueless about the steps of service.

Speaking of being checked on, we were one of three tables in the restaurant, yet somehow had three different people waiting on us. There is clearly not a section system in place, with all the servers sharing responsibility for all the tables. In theory, this is a helpful thing for when a server is in the weeds and can't even spare a minute to greet a table or refill a drink, but not when the restaurant has fewer than a dozen tables in the entire dining area. The amount of hovering and frequency of check-ins made it impossible for us to maintain a conversation for more than five minutes at a time before being interrupted.

By the time we were about 3/4 of the way through our sushi plate, one of the servers asked if we were going to need a box. Totally reasonable, and an appropriate time in the meal to ask that question. But after I told her \"no thanks, we're still working on it,\" she kept walking from the register to the kitchen, eyeing the plate for the first opportunity she could get to clear the table. When there was one piece of sushi left, she grabbed the plate while asking \"can I get this out of your way?\" When we responded with \"not yet, thank you\" she pulled her hand back and just stood there, waiting awkwardly for one of us to eat the last piece. Not exactly a great way to end a meal.

---

A note about the food:
My wife and I always get the two-person sushi combination plate. The miso soup is kind of bland, but it's free with the meal so who cares? The sushi (the important part) always tastes good, but it always comes out on a hot plate. I know for a fact that the fish is fresh and stored at a proper temperature in the sushi bar area, but it's kind of distressing to put warm raw meat in your mouth.

If management sees this review, please pass it along to your staff that customers know when you're trying to rush them through their meals. Honestly, I would understand that treatment if we were the only two people in the restaurant 20 minutes before close. But we weren't. It was 7:30 on a slow Wednesday. And for the love of god, please keep some chilled plates on-hand for the half of your menu that's served raw.

And to the people who are thinking of eating here: do it! The food is good! Just make sure you order it for carryout."}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! Very fresh and delicious!! Not too impressed with the original dishes you would find any where else. I go here for the sushi alone!"}
{"text":"Place is always busy for a reason. Good selection of sushi and food. Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi is really good. Smaller place if you inside but attentive."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Jin House and my friend ordered General Tso's Chicken.  It was so tough and chewing she could not eat it.  I tried it and it was true.  We let the waitress know and the next thing we know the owner came to the table and told us that he sells  100 pounds of it every week and no one complains.  My friend was just trying to explain that it was so chewy she couldn't eat it.  She was upset because of the way he was handling her complaint.  She said she wouldn't be back and He said he didn't care. We were flabbergasted!  We have been faithful customers for quite awhile. I have even purchased gift cards for this place.  I don't know if the chef is no longer there and there has been cut backs or what but the quality of the food is not the same/??????? And the owner could care less. He was rude and really shocked us! Bad customer service at this place."}
{"text":"I love their food.  Fresh, good quality a little pricey but really high quality.  Limited seating and always packed.  Everything I've tried was good.  It is one of our better restaurants on the Westside.  I wish I could afford to do there more.  ."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. They forget the rice. You had one job!

It's only a staple ingredient in about two of every three items on the menu there. It's typically the subject of the first question asked after you place your order: white or fried. When humanitarian supplies reach disaster-stricken areas after a hurricane or typhoon halfway around the world, rice is the one food they distribute."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I don't normally write reviews but I think this place deserves it.. We went here tonight and did not know what to expect because we were traveling from out of town.  This restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful!  It is hard to find good service anymore but everyone was extremely attentive and ready to assist you.  The menu was outrageous with soo many Chinese and Japanese options.  We could not believe how much you get for your meal.. For $11 I got chicken and shrimp hibachi with wonton soup and an egg roll.   They gave me so much food that I have a complete meal leftover for dinner tomorrow!  In fact, our entire table of 4 had tons of leftovers because you get so much for the price.. And it was all delicious and tasted fresh!  We were all really amazed at how fast, efficient and delicious everything was..The ONLY bad thing is that this restaurant is far from where we live because we would love to come here all the time.. If we are ever in this area again, we will make a stop at Jin's House!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time yesterday, March 21st.

Layout / Interior:

I went around 11:30am hoping to beat the lunch rush but it was already busy.  There was only about 7 booths and they were all full. There were some chairs around the server window area but it's pretty close to the cash register so it wasn't comfortable having people coming in and practically standing over you while they ordered and paid for their food.  This place seems to be popular, too bad they don't have a bigger space to accommodate the crowd that wish to sit down and eat.

Customer Service:

When I arrived I was immediately asked for my order by the cashier.  Honestly, it annoys me that I can't have a moment to look at the menu options and decide on a meal.  I wasn't asked if I wanted take out or to dine in.  I really wanted to dine in, but there were no available booths and the cashier assumed I wanted a take out order.

Once while I was waiting for my food by the cash register, an older lady walked in and the brunette cashier/server asked if she wanted to dine in or take out.  The older lady didn't not answer her immediately so the cashier/server said, \"Like what, am I invisible?!\"  I was shocked she would make that statement with me sitting right there within earshot.  The lady was older perhaps she simply didn't hear the server.  To the server, if you don't like working with the clientele - get another job or perhaps get from behind the cash register and actually walk up to greet the customers instead of shouting over people.

The food took about 15-20 minutes.  I ordered the General Tso. I get an hour lunch break, but for those who only have 30 minutes for lunch this probably isn't the place for you.  When I got the food, I opened the bag to ensure everything I ordered was in there.  The chef (and/or owner) practically stared me down while I was doing this.  I guess he was surprised that I took the time to make sure my order was right.  Either way, I didn't appreciate being stared down like that.

The Food:

Again, I ordered General Tso chicken with soup and egg rolls.  The egg roll was ok.  I didn't touch the soup.  As for the General Tso it was just ok as well.  Typical Chinese food fare, nothing special. I did notice with the last few pieces I ate that I had a difficult time chewing through the chicken.  I ultimately had to spit it out.  I'm not sure if the chicken was stale, but it shouldn't have been that tough. I was finished with the meal by then (about half way through my portion).  About an hour and a half later, let's just said I experienced some \"very uncomfortable stomach problems\".  Needless to say, I threw the rest of my order out.  

Pricing:
Reasonable.

Verdict:
I won't go back."}
{"text":"Why in gods green earth did my chicken and broccoli take an hour to get to my table? It has caused me an unfathomable deal of sadness because it was my birthday and I just wanted some good Asian food. I am Asian and this restaurant is just disrespecting the Asian culture."}
{"text":"Excellent Teriyaki. Steak was tender and juicy. Highly recommend the pork dumplings. Friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food restaurant ever!  Phenomenal."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant based on it's ratings on Yelp, we happened to be in Amherst.  To say we were disappointed is an understatement.  Food was below par, maybe it was what we ordered, General Tsu's chicken and Orange Chicken. If I had to guess the chicken is probably frozen (breaded) then deep fried, and sauce poured over it.  The chicken pieces were actually hard - you could not pierce with a fork into it in order to pick it up, and we were not given knives.  Both dishes indicated they would be spicy - they were not, nor did they have much flavor at all, and there was no pepper on the tables.  The fried rice was not fried at all, again if I had to guess some type of packaged rice.  Nothing good or authentic about these dinners, I tasted my dinner, but did not eat it and did not even take it home.  Our beverages were never refilled - so our dinner consisted of one glass of soda, an egg roll, a taste of soup, and a taste of sub par dinner.  Huge waste - never again!"}
{"text":"I have never had such a worse customer experience.  Talk about not caring about your customer needs.  This is my fourth time coming to this restaurant and I wanted to order the any 2 sushi rolls for lunch.  It said any two but I figured if I wanted a special roll I would pay the up charge.  First the server said we don't do that I requested why if i want to pay the price difference.  The roll that was included was $5.50 and the one I wanted was $8.95, he went back to ask the manager who said the up charge was $8.00 which any one who calculates math knows that makes no sense since I am substituting a roll not adding it on.  I ask for the manager again.  The server tells me she refuses to come out.  I ask him if he was telling me that a customer is asking for a manager and she refuses.

The manager then comes out and begins talking very loud about how busy she is.  I am still talking in my normal voice and the server says to me this is a restaurant and there are other customers.  I looked at him and said your manager is the one hollering not me.  He said I know but please lower your voice.  The manager begins speaking again in a lower voice and basically tells me that I can pay the $8.00 up charge or not get it.  I ask for the owner's contact info and he says his name is Mr. JIN but he does not know how to reach him.  I cannot believe the experience!!! This place maybe good tasting but that does not give them the right to treat their customers bad.  I hope the owner reads this and trains his staff better.  That was just terrible and humiliating."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Jin's House, though I do think it could have been a good bit better. I ordered four kinds of sushi, hot tea and a miso soup. The tea and soup were very good and the sushi was pretty good, though I think it's a dollar too expensive accross the board. Even for the larger CLE metro area, it felt like a little bit of a ripoff.

I probably wouldn't feel that way except the service was cold. Ice cold. As cold as lake effect snow. I only saw my waitress twice (when I sat down and when she delivered the check). A busboy delivered my food, and the sushi chef did not smile or even look at me--even though I sat at the sushi bar.

Perhaps everyone was just having a bad day, but this was very offputting. And frankly, I don't much care if the service is bad if they want to have cheaper sushi. But if you want as much as they ask for even a basic roll, then I'd like a smile and a water refil."}
{"text":"I'd been reading the reviews about the sushi at the Jin House so I decided to give it a try.  I had an array of sushi and sashimi all of which were outstanding.  It is wonderful to have such an excellent sushi restaurant close by so you don't have to drive to Cleveland.  I will definitely be returning in the future."}
