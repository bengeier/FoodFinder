{"text":"Made with pure love and tastes like grandma's cooking. The food was seasoned very well, spice that packs heat but not overwhelming. No one ever gets macaroni and cheese right in my opinion, but Soul Central hit the nail on the head with their mac and cheese. Lastly, the people who worked there are very friendly and helpful. If you want some good soul food in Charlotte definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Food is simply amazing.  You're greeted warmly and service is fast, accurate and friendly.  Nothing fancy here but the food. If you're into delicious, homemade soul food with a caribbean flair, you better make your way here.  You'll thank me."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday right after lunch specials ended. There were two ladies in front of me having a hard time making a decision.  They also wanted lunch special prices but it was clearly after 3pm.  People in this industry work hard and have to earn a living.  The prices are fair and I consider it a good value.  I had mashed potatoes, meatloaf and mac and cheese and it came with cornbread and a drink.  The cornbread was a little sweet but I liked it.  The mashed potatoes I got without gravy, not bad.  The meatloaf was a little higher ratio of loaf to meat than I prefer. I've had better and certainly worse.  Mac and cheese didn't blow me away.  Food is cafeteria style.  It's sitting there when you walk in and there is nothing to lead you to believe it is either hot or fresh.  My expectations of quality were managed.  Service was very good.  They were patient with the two if front of me and were able to serve (fix my plate) quickly.  Would I return? Sure. It's affordable and there's lots to offer that I did not try. It's also in my hood.  Have I returned? Not  yet."}
{"text":"Long live soul central and their most excellent fried chicken !  my mom and dad took us here before they dropped me and my son  off at the airport . We all dug in. Those greens were perfect, not blown apart and overly smokey , they were vegan in fact and no meat eater could say no to their persuasive powers . The mac and cheese, the best I've had in a long time ( sorry aunt  billie) just sung to me with the right Amount to Texas Pete . We ate in silence e because that's what you do when you're in the presence of greatness. Don't forget the real brewed iced tea to wash it all down . On the flight back to California , I thought of the fried chicken and of Soul Central and drifted to sleep. How much you wanna bet I'll be eating there on my next visit?"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the customer service sucks. When I went in I didn't even get greeted not even a smile, and the lady that served my food acted  like she didn't want to serve me. I will not be returning because I do not have to spend my money in such a place. Also with the rewards card that they offer it states that you can get a credit per combo I purchased 2 Combos and they only gave me one credit. It needs to say on the card that you only get one credit per visit so that there will not be any confusion."}
{"text":"Best Soul food in town! Fresh vegetables everyday. I love the Jalapeno cornbread. Check them out today. The prices are great!"}
{"text":"Went to Soul Central for the first time today and was impressed!  I had beef tips, collards, mashed potatoes, and jalapeno corn bread.  My husband had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and jalapeno corn bread.  The food tasted great and was a good value!  There isn't much seating so luckily we were there early enough to get a table."}
{"text":"Just a great local restaurant featuring scratch made comfort food. It was our first visit and the owner spent several minutes letting us sample some sides and meatloaf. Everything we tasted was great, and he even gave us a sample of the jerk pork chop (outstanding) and mentioned some future menu items they were considering. Portions were well sized and prices were very reasonable. Great find."}
{"text":"My husband was a regular visitor to Lola's Uptown and got wind of Soul Central's opening in Plaza Midwood last week. Since then, we've eaten there THREE TIMES. I would have gone a couple more times but we are trying to be restrained. (Ish.)

If you love soul food, this is the place. The owners and cook are extremely sweet and rightfully proud of their business. We had chicken (baked and fried- both fantastic), sweet potatoes, green beans, collards (I'm normally not into them, but love them here), mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and some serious cornbread, with or without jalape√±os. We also had the Saturday special: Trinidadian chicken curry (bones in the mix- watch out!) and the curried garbanzo beans. Excellent- and they will be doing oxtail every other Saturday.

Show them some love- they are a great addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best mac & cheese in Charlotte!! Great ribs. Never disappointed with their food or service!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The staff is very accommodating and the food makes you lick your fingers. The portions are good but the mac and cheese is out of this world. Any thing you get will be good."}
{"text":"The food is amaaaaaazing!! I loved the meatloaf and the cabbage was to die for! Its just home momma would make it with but with an added burst of flavor! The price is very economical for the amount of food that you receive. You will not be disappointed if you choose this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Charlotte this week for a concert and found Soul Central on Yelp. It sounded really good so we drove over to check it out. I'll admit that the outside doesn't look all that inviting. Just a small storefront in a strip mall. But we decided to give it a try and we were blown away by how good the food was. We both had the pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy. I had the collards and she had the string beans. For desert I had the peach cobbler and she had the banana pudding. Every item was fantastic. When the owner came over to check on us I told him that I was amazed that he could make EVERY ITEM taste so good. So he gave us a little history on his cooking and where he learned to cook so well. 

All in all, a very friendly group of people that cook the best food I have eaten in a long time. I don't get to Charlotte very often but I will make it a point to eat at Soul Central the next time I am there. My only regret is that I was there for only one night. I would have loved to sample some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been looking for fantastic soulful food in Charlotte for a while. And now that I've found it, I can stop going or bringing new people. Everything I've tried, I've LOVED - the fried chicken, baked chicken, meatloaf, and pot roast. My favorite restaurant mashed potatoes I've ever had. Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes are amazing. The greens are fantastic. Everything is made with love, care and flavor for days. Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, you name it LOL! And the service is saintly.  I'd give them 10 stars out of 5. Seriously!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I got the Jerk Chicken, both dark and white meat. The Mac and Cheese was delicious, the red beans and rice was amazing also. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meat and three! I had pot roast, collards, black-eyed peas and mac 'n cheese. Everything was perfect. The only complaint is the excessive use of styrofoam and plastic ware, but I guess that's the nature of the take-out beast. I dined inside, and it was pleasant. If the operation was more geared towards dine-in, I'd dock them a star for all the waste. In conclusion, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Meatloaf was really good! The mac & cheese was a little soupy for me...noodles were very overdone. The cabbage was very spicy, which might work for someone who likes spicy food. The parking lot was very tight also very limited."}
{"text":"I came here this afternoon after deciding I cant cook due to my abs still on fire from HSM Core!

I was greeted and asked if I was ready to order. I never been here before and I was already eyeing the menu. I saw that some Saturday dishes were right up my alley. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any curry goat today. Instead of saying no, she replied, \"No, its chicken.\" I replied with saying that I see thats on the menu, I am asking about the Saturday special. She then follows up with saying its rarely offered anymore. Why have it on the menu???

Anyways...I order the oxtails (rice was complimentary), greens, and black eye peas. I show the cashier my yelp check to receive my drink. They let me get lemonade.

Upon arriving home to eat my dinner, I found my meal to be just ok. The oxtails had a twinge of sweetness to them, which Im not used to with that dish. I thought my greens would be the same way but they were not. They were tender, but I cant tell if I taste grit from not washing the greens thoroughly or some type of seasoning. The lemonade didn't have any sweetness to it. It just tasted like lemon water. Glad it was free. And the black eye peas were very salty! I had to take a bite with the rice to mellow it out. I put the food in the fridge. And I wasnt offered or received any bread.

I wanted to really like this place. Maybe I will try something else next time. Maybe..."}
{"text":"Obviously I'm the odd one out here but I was very unimpressed. I paid $10 for a meal i could have made at home, and I am not a good cook. I had really high expectations because it seemed really authentic and I heard great things. But I felt like I was eating cafeteria food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Meatloaf awesome, baked chicken awesome and the mac n cheese outstanding!!! So much flavor and everything cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Can't beat their special. Meat, two sides, cornbread and a drink! Love coming here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I was here the other day. I must say the food is great. Thank you so much. I went to the kings kitchen the food was so bad. This place got soul and great food. Thank you."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating, very satisfied. Will be back & def recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I go to this place for lunch at least once a week. I love their food! The spice is right and they are super nice! I love their meatloaf and mac n cheese! I am dying to try their bbq ribs."}
{"text":"So glad I found the crew from Lola's!! Had the fried chicken, cabbage, jalape√±o corn bread, hubby had the mac&cheese instead of the cabbage. Miss the location uptown but this location is quick to carry-out."}
{"text":"I had the pot roast, Mac n' cheese, and mashed potatoes. Let me tell you it tasted amazing and hit the spot. The meal was the combo and ended up being around $10 which was pretty great because it came with plenty of food. I'd definitely recommend coming here for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. One of my new favorite spots to eat in Charlotte! Great food phenomenal service relaxing upbeat vibe. Definitely suggest the Jerk Chicken but you really cant go wrong with any choice. Good ole home cookin! ITS SLAP YOUR GRANDMAMA GOOD"}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food that you will find in the QC. The customer service is great and the food is even better. Trust me you will enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the staff is so friendly. So happy I finally tried it out. I will definitely be back again ASAP. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Although I could easily see people getting this place confused with the long standing restaurant Soul that happens to be on Central it is quite different.  This is great soul/southern food with a little island flair if you want.

When I walked up I was a little confused.  I expected to be smelling some ham hocks in collards and all I could smell was curry.  Once I got inside though, I realized that this place had a little more diversity than your average soul food spot.

I ordered myself some jerk chicken, green beans, mac and cheese and some jalapeno corn bread.  I ordered some meatloaf and mash potatoes for my cohort.  The jerk chicken certainly didn't blow me away, but everything else was awesome!  Great creamy mac and cheese.  Perfectly cooked green beans.  Plus, that corn bread ain't no joke either.  All that food, plus drinks for under $20.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"After seeing all the good reviews I just had to give this place a try. I'm glad did! 

I ordered the weekly special - which is your choice of meat, one side and a piece of cornbread. For the price, you simply can't beat that! 

I went with the meatloaf, collard greens and jalape√±o cornbread. 

The meatloaf was savory and delicious. The collards were well seasoned and are vegan! So everyone can enjoy them. And while the jalape√±o cornbread was a perfect compliment! 

The service was great too! Everyone here was very kind!  I saw a lot of other goodies that I'd want to try here so I'm absolutely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of my Mana's cooking. Great comfort food!  I have recommend this place to everyone!  Deep fried chicken is Juicy and crisp! The homemade Macaroni and Cheese is so good it will make you want to slap your Mama!  Lol. The cornbread is moist and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Most authentic southern/home cooked food I have ever had in Charlotte. Amazing!! You can tell they use real ingredients and no short cuts."}
{"text":"I tried this Thursday it was very good the pork chops were very tender and Mac and cheese was very good definitely would eat their again"}
{"text":"This is the best soul food in Charlotte hands down. The best collard greens ever and there cornbread is amazing. Everything I have eaten here has been excellent even the tea is amazing. 
The owner and staff are the best."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on reviews. I made sure to wait till Wednesday when they had the pot roast, however by the time my fianc√© got there to order my food they were out. Was disappointed but I told him to get me the fried chicken and meatloaf. The chicken was really good but the meatloaf was just ok. I also tried the Mac and cheese, and the dressing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but the dressing wasn't that good. Wanted to try the dirty rice but they were out of that too. My meal came with cornbread which was ok but I'm not really a cornbread gal. (I prefer rolls). Overall, some of the food was good, some not so much. I'll try again on another Wednesday, maybe they won't be out of the pot roast. Still in search of a soul food restaurant that wows me."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed as it is close to Mom's cooking. Service is quick and pleasant, plus the price is great. For $10, you get a meat, 2 sides, choice of regular/jalape√±o cornbread (mmm tasty) and a tea. Their unsweetened tea is brewed nicely that you can drink straight. Also noticed a $6.99 lunch special  which is a meat, one side and bread only if you are not very hungry. Will definitely  make another trip to this spot."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great service, and more importantly delicious food at a great price. Definitely a new neighborhood staple. The meatloaf was perfection."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Southern hospitality at its best. We had baked chicken, Mac and cheese, collards, jalape√±o cornbread, stuffing, and fried okra. Service was so superb, staff was so attentive. She reminded me of my grandma! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Dined at this new establishment on two occasions so far and each time the food was A-Mazing!! Southern home cooking done right is a spot on description."}
{"text":"As I live within walking distance of Soul I dine here at least once or twice a week.  As a result there is no Yelper more qualified to share the heart and soul of Soul Central.  Here's everything you need to know from the Soul to the Central...

Parking:  I guess you could say Soul Central has its own parking lot in a way.  Soul Central is located in the same, bummy-looking plaza as Three Amigos (another local favorite in case you did't know) and as a result parking can often be crowded and a bit tight to say the least.  If there's no parking in the immediate area in front of Soul Central, don't fear there's plenty of parking in the rear.

Food:  Awesome.  Amazing.  Fresh.  Fantastic.  Tasty.  Tender.  Seasoned.  Succulent.   Pick an adjective.  Everything, and I mean absolutely every single food item they serve is on point.  The candied yams are awesome.  The mac-n-cheese is no lie, something I find only on Thanksgiving Day.  The collards - make you just shake your head - YUMMY!  Don't get me started on the wings!  You heard it here first:  THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN WINGS IN CHARLOTTE. 

Service:  The service couldn't be more friendly, kind and courteous.  Everyone there is super friendly.  Yes, they can be slow.  This isn't Chipotle, it can take a 10min or longer to get your food, know that going in. Or, save yourself some time, and call-in a pick-up order, and you're good.

Those that know will agree, there simply is no better Soul Food in Charlotte, NC.  I don't care what you call it - soul food, comfort food, grandma's cooking, down-home cooking - its good food.  Sorry Grandma, but this spot has you beat!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style restaurant off of Central, stopped by for an early dinner and had the baked chicken over dressing, greens and cajun rice with bread and drink for $10.  The rice didn't have much flavor and the corn bread was ok but the chicken, dressing and greens were all good.  May return to try more sides."}
{"text":"I am soooo happy this place moved into the neighborhood! We stopped in for takeout tonight. Great food, cafeteria-style so it's fast. All the staff was really friendly. Chef David from Lola's is here, so stop crying over missing your favorite mac and cheese and get over here. 

I'm a little worried my skinny jeans might take a permanent vacation, since this place is within walking distance of my house. But skinny jeans don't understand me like Soul Central's mac and cheese does, anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent Soul Food!

I lived in Plaza for 4 months before trying this place and it was a mistake! I tried the daily special - BBQ Chicken, Mac n cheese, collards, jalape√±o cornbread, and a banana pudding. Everything was excellent. 

I spoke to the owner and love the vibe - Looking forward to coming back and trying the other daily specials."}
{"text":"Smallest breast and wing i ever got for this price.  Went here for 1st time couple of weeks ago and rapid decline since smh.  This piece of chicken was dry as hell and Cabbage and mac tasted 3 days old. I tried to support but today was last straw.  This is what happens when u dont watch your to  go order being madeZ. Like who you saving big pieces for??? What for u to take home for dinner or something."}
{"text":"First of all I want everyone to know how nice the owners are. And the food was delicious. I had to wait for about 10 minutes while they fried my chicken, but it was well worth it. And they gave me a free sample of the bbq ribs. That alone would have made the wait worth while. But the other customer that was eating there, kept me entertained. Brave the small parking lot and that Central Ave traffic, and go there. The food and the owners will make it all worth while."}
{"text":"After a much needed massage, Soul Central was on my radar, as it was just a few minutes from where I was and also had great reviews.

Not sure if I caught them on an off day but the food wasn't what I was expecting. Staff was great and prompt. The place was packed (good sign right?).

I ordered the wings (per some reviews), mac and cheese and cabbage. For my drink, an Arnold Palmer...TASTY! I'm not a fan of \"super sugary\" drinks and this Arnold Palmer was spot on, perfect. You can dine in, if you'd like. The place is pretty small, with 3 tables available. I opted to go home, which wasn't too far.

The chicken, super crispy (win) but lacked flavor. I ended up dousing it with Louisiana hot sauce. The mac and cheese was good and the cabbage was terrible (I hate to type this). It was spicy, from some type of orange pepper that was added to it but it had NO flavor. No salt, no nothing. It ended up in the garbage unfortunately. I should've gotten the greens. It was a toss up when I got to the register and I went with the cabbage.

I really wanted to like this place, based off of the reviews. Will I give it another shot, absolutely! But I won't be driving out of my way to try it again. I hope next time is better."}
{"text":"Went in here not expecting much. The man working the counter was great and recommended some choices for me. I got the curry chicken with their homemade sauce. There homemade sauce was really spicy and good. I wish I could go back and try their fried chicken. It is a great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today - small restaurant, mostly for takeout but with 3 or 4 tables.  Informal, order at the counter.  Great food though!  I had the jerked chicken, potatoes and black-eyed peas, along with some very tasty cornbread!"}
{"text":"On a humbug I figured I'd search for some new spots to eat for lunch and happened upon Soul Central. Now I'm from the South and soul food is a way of life in my family so though I was initially skeptical, I decided to give it a try. According to the owner they've been open about 7 months and have been a hit with the customers. 

The Space: Small storefront situated beside a hair salon and convenience store. There's limited seating (3 small tables, 9 chairs and a bench). There's not much for decor but I think they're going for an island theme judging by the Caribbean music playing and the Trinidad and Tobago flag displayed at the front. 

The service: I was greeted by a very nice woman who ascertained that I was a new customer and was immediately helpful in my meal choosing. She ensured that all my food was fresh and hot and she even came back to ask if everything was ok. Also, though it's more of a self service spot she didn't charge me for my food until after I ate. Excellent! Also the manager came over and struck up a conversation with me which was nice. She might've sold me on coming back for the Roti and she mentioned they plan to expand the menu to include oxtails soon! The only thing is that the fried chicken took a super long time to come out and by the time it did I was too full to try it while it was still hot.   

The food: I was a fatty and ordered Pot Roast AND Fried Chicken since I couldn't choose. For sides I ordered the Mac n cheese and collard greens. Everything was AMAZING. The roast was well seasoned and very tender. The collard greens are vegan so even without meat they were very tasty. I'm just partial to my mama's Mac n cheese and no one will come close to that but it was a basic baked Mac n cheese but good. The cornbread wasn't anything spectacular but it wasn't hard or bland. It kinda tasted like jiffy corn bread. They also have deserts but I was way too full to try any. Maybe next time. BUT THE FRIED CHICKEN THO!!!! Man, listen.  

The value: For 10.00 it was a lot of food considering its \"homemade\" and you can spend way more than that at a fast food restaurant. 

The experience: I came in after lunch around 2pm and it was empty. I didn't mind it since it's so small. Overall it was good and I felt welcome and attended to without it being overbearing. The chicken was fried fresh which meant I had to wait but also I had fresh hot chicken #catch22 I would definitely return to try more food :)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly really tasty !! I have passed this place a MILLION times & never tried it! Finally did.. regretted nothing! I tried a basic jerked chicken w/ rice n'peas situation. I thought twice when I saw Asian cooks (can't lie) but I felt dumb once I tasted everything!! Worth a shot.."}
{"text":"Super homey feeling , food was amazing. Got the baked chicken , mac and cheese, dirty rice , and corn bread. All of it was great."}
{"text":"After we read the reviews about how small the inside was, we decided to get there early! We arrived at 11am! The food was ready to go! My husband ordered the meatloaf,mac and cheese and dressing! He said the dressing was lacking in flavor!  But the meatloaf and Mac cheese were great! I ordered the fried chicken, mac and cheese and dirty rice! The fried chicken is cooked to order so be prepared to wait! Worth the wait by the way! The portions are huge but It was hot inside! The customer service was good and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food! We went last night and we're met by the most welcoming staff. We were offered a choice of 1 meat (fish, baked or fried chicken) and 2 sides ( choice of collards, mac n cheese, cabbage, green beans, rice, beans, etc.). I had the whiting and collards, and the rice and beans. It was delicious! They also make their own hot sauce in house that was glorious. We were even given samples of fried okra and chicken and broccoli casserole that were also very good. There was sooo much food we had to do takeout boxes. Would definitely go there again the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had a deliciously soul satisfying lunch at soul central and if I could I'd be there everyday.  Very pleasant experience from staff and the quality and quantity of food to match. I'm vegetarian so to be able to have a meal that doesn't solely consist of a salad (America diet) is always a treat. Mac & cheese, red potatoes & greens with the moistest cornbread ever hit the spot. Support them as I do believe they are the best soul food restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Found out about Soul Central from a friend in fb.  It was a pleasant find, the food here is amazing!  Additionally amazed to find that it is run by Trinidadian people who add that little extra island flavor to the food. Everything I have tried so far was good and as a little bonus you can even get Dahl Puri Roti, if you are from the Caribbean and know what that is, on Saturdays.  You have to try this place at least once but be warned, you may get addicted!"}
{"text":"I recently learned about Soul Central and my boyfriend and I went for dinner.It is AMAZING!!It was so amazing I went again the next day for lunch.

There are a variety of daily options to select from wherein you choose one meat and two sides.The food is already prepared and ready to be served.I have tasted the smothered porkchop,fried talapia,meat loaf,collard greens,cabbage,black eyed peas,yams,and mac&cheese.This review would be so long if I went into detail about how each option has its own perfected,unique taste.To top it off you are given cornbread or a roll.I chose the jalape√±o cornbread both times.It is very moist like a pound cake.

Like I said,I can go and on.My advice to  you is to go check it out and be welcomed by the friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Nice that it came with a tea and cornbread; subtle touch. But nonetheless, the veggie options are slim (mostly rice and starchy sides), and the meats are straight-forward. Was not as impressed as other reviewers. With that said, bumping from 2 to 3 because I still think this place is good for the hood, and has potential. Hopefully they will think fresher, and less cafeteria-like!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Soul Central at 7:20pm on a Wednesday. Per the sign on the door they closed at 8pm. There was someone in line in front of us that ordered and she got her food and left. Then we wanted the fried chicken and fried fish platters, but we were told they close at 8 so the fryers are being shut down??? So they close in 30+ minutes but yet we can't order food. So my 1 star isn't for the food because we never got any, but for the service or lack of....I could understand if was 5 mins to closing but they where still really opened."}
{"text":"What a great find late on a Saturday evening. The food is great!! The sweet tea is very sweet but good. The cornbread was fire! The bbq sauce was good and the portion sizes were more than what meets the eye. We got the ribs, mashed potatoes and cabbage. The curry chicken was pretty good a little dry for my liking but those curry potatoes and black eyed peas were fantastic"}
{"text":"Let's see...they've got greens, beans, potatoes, tomatoes, chickens, turkeys - YOU NAME IT! (sorry I had to...)

Seriously though, this place actually delivers on providing delicious and affordable soul food. As mentioned in numerous other reviews, the place is tiny. It's right next door to the ever-popular Three Amigos and just like Three Amigos, the place can fill up quickly depending on the time of day.

Because of aforementioned size, I wouldn't recommend dining in. They have about two tables indoors and two tables outside. However, there's no working A/C. At least there wasn't the day I visited. Take your food to-go and enjoy it all in the comfort of your own surroundings.

I would say come prepared knowing what you'd like but due to the availability of some items, they may sell out early on in the day and not have them refilled as of yet. When I visited around 3/3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, I was told that they were already out of collards (I'm going to place blame on the lunch rush). I placed an order for a side of chicken wings (minimum order of 5 pieces) and flounder fish combo with green beans & mac & cheese as sides.

To note, they bread and fry every piece of fish and chicken fresh to order. That's right, there are no pieces of fried chicken or fish laying around getting cold/hard, which is the norm at other establishments. So be prepared to wait around 10-15ish minutes or so if you didn't call in your order. The time they spend to do that is WELL WORTH IT. When I got home, the chicken was so crispy and juicy. They keep the other sides such as the green beans, mac & cheese, yams, mashed potatoes, pinto beans, etc in the cafeteria-style line up. They also now have macaroni salad. Again, the availability of all is subject to change depending on the time of day. 

Don't forget to check in to yelp for a free sweet tea with purchase! They also have lemonade and a soft drink machine. For dessert, there's apple/peach/cherry cobblers, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding - all $2.50/slice.

My only advice? go to Soul Central and order as much food as possible. Enjoy. Repeat."}
{"text":"Soul central is not real soul food. It seems to be a take on soul food that isn't what im used to. The yelp reviews seemed great but when we actually tasted the food it didn't align with expectations. Meatloaf was okay, greens tasted sweet though. It seems like an effort that wasn't fully compatible with the ingredients. Food was all cooked correctly but tastes where just a little bit off. The banana pudding was just vanilla pudding and soggy vanilla wafers. I recommend baking nilla wafers to dehydrate them before putting in pudding. I guess it's just about what you like but by no means am I saying don't go there. Just be wary of the label as soul food."}
{"text":"We've been to Soul Central a few times and I enjoy their food. They have a nice selection of menu items and since people seem to always be coming and going they have to keep replenishing the food which means that it's fresh and not sitting around for long. 
This time around I had baked chicken with black eyed peas and collard greens (I'd asked if I could have rice with my black eyed peas and I was assured I could, but alas when I got home, no rice. Oh well). My daughter had fried fish. As usual my food was tasty. They had corn bread with jalape√±o in it. Since spicy food gives me acid reflux I wish they offered plain cornbread. Maybe they do and were just out. I believe their vegetables are prepared without meat so if you're a vegetarian you'll have options, and they're very flavorful. Certain items here are made to order so be prepared to wait. This place is more suited to take-out orders. Friendly staff, good food, reasonable price. Definitely give Soul Central a try."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic West Indian cuisine. Daily specials keep you coming back for more! Mac n' cheese is top of the line, fried chicken was on point, service s excellent."}
{"text":"Tried Soul Central for the first time today - I was very impressed with both the taste of the food and also the customer service received from Chef David. I read from a previous review that Chef David is the same chef who cooked at Lola's and I was already a huge Lola's fan before they closed so I knew I would not be disappointed. It is a great place for some grab and go soul food! Seasoned just right. I am sure Chef David will eventually know me by name in no time as I plan on eating here at least once a week! So support Chef David and eat some damn good soul food while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Best southern cooking in town! Ribs are my favorite in NC! 

Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese, Curry Chicken are favorites!"}
{"text":"Got the veggie plate it was so good .  The man who worked there was very nice and they had so many options for vegetarians. Everything was seasoned so good. I didn't need to add anything!"}
{"text":"Great soul food. Awesome staff. Get some chicken, rubs, fish, etc... southern cooking."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here today for lunch. Honestly, we didn't have high expectations. I am so glad we were wrong! I seriously want to go back even though it would be a drive. 
We both had the jerk chicken. It had just the right amount of spice, and was juicy. I got mashed potatoes and green beans with mine. Those beans were fabulous! My daughter had the yams, and they looked good. I don't normally like cornbread, so I didn't get any. However, I regretted that decision after tasting it. The tea was perfection. 
The service was wonderful. The people were so nice. Overall, this place is definitely worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the portion sizes were huge!! The staff were very friendly. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"$10.21 gets you: a large slice of meatloaf, a generous serving of both homemade collard greens and mac 'n cheese, a square of cornbread, and a drink - which in my case was iced tea with lemon. 

* Meat loaf. 4/5
All meat with no onions or green peppers in the mix. It was topped properly with a thick tomato paste. No catsup was available and fortunately none was needed. I would definitely order this entree again. 

* Collard Greens. 4/5
The real deal and not out of a can. I added vinegar, Texas Pete hot sauce, and a little salt. The serving size was extremely generous. There wasn't any meat (fatback) in the collards, which knocked it down a notch. The collards were delicious after I finished doctoring them. 

*  Mac 'n Cheese. 3/5
I've had better and I've had far worse. These were not the creamy sauce type of mac 'n cheese, but the thick baked and browned cheese topping variety. I liked them. 

* Corn Bread. 5/5
Light, moist, and not too sweet, with the texture of pound cake. My mother would have approved.

* Sweet Iced Tea w/Lemon. 5/5
The sweetness was perfectly balanced. Iced tea is FREE with a dine in meal. There is one free refill as well. 

* Service. 5/5
VERY friendly and welcoming. You'll have your food in less than a minute if the line is not out the door.....and that is very likely. 

* Cleanliness. 4.75/5
98.0%. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=179417&esttst_cty=60

* Ambience. 
If you try to scratch your nose....you'll knock someone else's hat off. This place is tiny inside. There are a total of eighteen seats, including those inside and out. Music will be playing, and if it's a warm day the front door will be open. There is a constant flow of people picking up takeout. 

* Parking. 
If you intend to dine in get there by 11:30 a.m. or good luck. This restaurant is situated right next to Three Amigos, which is an extremely popular restaurant in its own right. There are some additional parking spaces on the left hand side of this little block of buildings and in the rear. 

PRO TIP:
Their website has an \"order online\" option which shows what is available on any given day.

I told the friendly owner that I had driven down from Hickory with the sole purpose of trying his soul food. As I was leaving he said, \"please come again, Mr. Hickory.\" I told him that it was worth the drive, and I was rewarded with another huge smile. ;o)

Soul food? Comfort food? Southern cooking? Caribbean island fare? It's all of those things. Soul Central is delicious food served at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Good selection and fresh picks.  I got the combination plate that is about $9.50 plus tax of BBQ chicken, Mac n cheese, and mash potatoes.  An extra side cost $2.50 so I passed on considering a real veggie.  I signed up easily on the loyalty pad.  The mash potatoes were good and the Mac was delicious with a kick perhaps pepperjack.  The BBQ chicken was good just wish it was a big meaty piece.  The cornbread was thick cake-like yet fluffy.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally, I went for the first time with my sister. Her boyfriend especially is a regular at the restaurant. The food was amazing! The menu had a great selection to choose from daily meat entrees to specific ones offered different days of the week. Several sides to choose from. I had jerk chicken, mac n cheese and collards. The food was delish and seasoned just right. Of, course I had dessert. Sweet potato pie. Yum. By far the best soul/caribbean food in Charlotte. The staff was so accommodating, super nice and very friendly. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo Goooooood!!! A must try!!!! Everything was so delicious. Great Customer Service. Thanks David"}
{"text":"Tried their food for the first time ever and I'm in love! I ordered their fried fish, mac and cheese, collard greens with a side of cornbread. The meal also came with an iced tea and I purchased their peach cobbler. Their service was excellent, location is clean and inviting. Food is inexpensive and less than 10 minutes from my job. I know where I'll be going for lunch on the regular now!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. I was visiting Charlotte and was craving some good southern soul food. This place was near where I was staying, so I decided to give them a try. Upon entering , I was instantly greeted. They had food out on the counter in front of you so you're able to see what the options were. Everything looked so good, it was difficult to chose. The server even offered to let me try the jalape√±o corn bread with my meal and exchange it if I did not like it. 

I got the jerk chicken, black eyed peas, regular corn bread and sweet tea. All of it was delicious!

I will definitely visit this place when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Very good food for the most part. Collard greens are to die for. I really liked the jalapeno cornbread. That dirty rice is very good also. You can only get it during the week tho. Went back on Saturday and the sides menu was limited, no dirty rice. Didn't like Mac and cheese. Tasted off in some way. Meatloaf was interesting but a little too solid for me. I think they add a little filler. Soul Central has become my #2 soul food place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I wish I took a picture of my food before digging in. This was my first time trying Soul Central. I ended up doing Postmates to my job (USE MY CODE 3K2B FOR FREE DELIVERY). I got fried chicken, mac and cheese, cabbage and black eye peas. It came with some cornbread. The first thing I dug into was the peas. Really good taste, almost has a spicy kick, I wish they were cooked longer and were mushy. Everything was superb, the cabbage needs some seasoning, but definitely edible. THE CORNBREAD.......... oh my goodness. It is definitely a treat. I want to tell everyone. I love trying new foods via Postmates, this will definitely be a staple."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte this was my first time locating a soul food restaurant lol. I went there with high expectations and they certainly did not disappoint! The restaurant is a cozy one but I was glad to see there was plenty of parking. They have different specials on different days. I opted for the baked chicken with mac and cheese, yams and corn bread. Everything was on point especially the corn bread. There were many different choices though. Everything from rice to collard greens. The staff was also very nice and attentive. I will be back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok so this maybe one of the best soul food places I've eaten from in awhile. The fried chicken was excellent and the collard greens and mac & cheese tasted like Thanksgiving, super yummy!. I will definitely be ordering from them again in the very near future! But next time don't forget to put the hot sauce in the bag!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is awesome. I have tried collard greens at every single soul restaurants in Charlotte and this definitely is the best I have ever eaten. Seasoning is right on and it has a little punch of spice. I had the meatloaf which was very flavorful and moist. The mac & cheese was to die for. The dirty rice was also very flavorful. The apple and peach cobbler was delicious and not too sweet. So good that I'm going back this Saturday."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time (takeout)...YES, YES, YES and more YES! Great food, great location, great prices. I happily plan to eat here each week more times than one probably should. Fried chicken, mac & cheese, green beans highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery via Postmates from Soul Central. The lunch special is $9.99 and comes with your choice of an entree (meat) and two sides. Trying to be quasi-healthy, I selected the baked chicken with collard greens and green beans. I was surprised to find a scoop of dressing and a piece of cornbread included when I opened the box. I'm happy to report it was worth every extra calorie though! 

The collard greens were out of this world. Sweet and savory. Perfectly cooked. The baked chicken was moist and flavorful. I don't even like dark meat chicken (I got a thigh) and ate every single bite. The corn bread was fluffy and cake-like. Someone help me out here... They must put yellow cake mix in that batter, right?! The stuffing was a perfect compliment to the chicken. And, the green beans, while paling in comparison to the other items, were still drool-worthy. 

Delivery via Postmates was only $3.99 and it arrived quickly (about 30 minutes after I placed the order) and piping hot! This one is going to be a regular lunch-time staple for sure."}
{"text":"Soul Food at it's best.  This new spot is right beside Three Amigos on Central Ave. If you loved \"Lolas\" you will definitely like Soul Central, because it's owned by former Lola's chef David.  Very friendly staff and the food is delicious.

I'm a meatloaf connoisseur and just like Lolas, they have one of the best in town!  If you're feeling adventurous, then try the jalape√±o cornbread over the regular. Mac n Cheese was my favorite side.  Sweat tea is money! 

There is some inside and outside seating, but not a lot, so it's more setup for buffet style to go orders.  They do accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Sampled the ribs upon entering. Very tasty sauce with a bit of a kick. I had the Meatloaf with Mashed Red Potatoes and Cabbage. Everything was very tasty! My husband had the Fried Chicken with Mac N cheese and Greens. Chicken was fried perfectly with good seasoning. We also had a side of yams which we're great! And the free Iced Tea and Cornbread with the meal was great! As far as the place itself, very clean. And I mean spotless! Great upkeep, great food, and very friendly and interactive staff. I'll definitely be back and refer others."}
{"text":"Worst.Food.Ever..

Greens - Way too salty
Black eyed peas - Way too salty
Fried fish - hard as a rock

Why would you think it's a good idea to OVERFRY a thin piece of fish like tilapia?  Why don't you serve fried catfish, which could possibly hold up to your penchant for frying beyond recognition. 

If there was an option to give zero stars, that's what this place would get from me. Save your money"}
{"text":"I ate here twice last week & I must say the chicken & dumplings are made the exact way my granny makes them! The dumplings are homestyle ~ not the rolled biscuit I see often. I wish they had dumplings everyday but Wednesday's are enough I suppose. 

I also had the meatloaf. The serving was more than expected & the quality of the meatloaf was superb. If you're looking for a home style meatloaf without a bunch of fillers then this is the place to go!!! 

Green beans, cabbage, Mac & cheese, yams were l perfect. The sweet tea was exceptionally delicious! The sweet tea is crafted with the perfect amount of sugar! 

I've had several folks tell me to try the dressing (stuffing if ur from up North) ~ they haven't had any as of yet but I'm definitely going to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Soul Central occupies the same spot as Ajbani Moroccan, and on that front, they fight the same battle - namely that it's not big. That alone isn't an issue (see Le's for just one such example where it is not an issue). But It can certainly make for a challenge. If you're having problems, head to Three Amigos and look to the left. Preferably not while driving. Park first, facing the building, then to the left, and you should have no problems.

Once inside, you will see the next challenge: Namely that there is not much room for dining. This is actually a separate issue, as there are places you can find that are intimate, but this isn't that. Look down the street a bit and find Euro Grill. Soul Central is smaller. That's not a bad thing, but when you're looking at a plate of food instead of a small sandwich, it can make a difference. You can get it to go, but it loses something when you have to clean it off your shirt, and you aren't going to make it all the way home without at least trying to eat it.

So let's say you find the place, you eat in, and that leads to the third challenge. This isn't soul food. There is soul in it, but it's not what your momma (or grandmomma) made. This is more island/caribbean food, with things like jerk chicken and jalapeno corn bread. Don't get me wrong - the flavors are great, even if some of the food itself may miss the mark a bit. But it's not strictly soul food.

And finally, we have the service. The service is great, and definitely is a reason to overlook some of the other potential missteps."}
{"text":"If I could give this post a zero I would. So disappointed buyers beware......do not eat at this restaurant this was the most awful food my husband and I, ever had in my life. Not worth the money. Food is out of the can, patties are overcooked, macaroni and cheese taste like paste, no cabbage and the chicken had no flavor.  I have never been to a Jamaican restaurant with the chicken having no flavor, that is what Jamaican food is known for the wonderful flavor. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Not authentic soul food (more like a C effort attempt of it). Authentic soul food has a distinct taste. It excites your tastebuds from the first bite. The food at Soul Central doesn't do that. Seasoning is lacking tremendously. Cabbage seasoning is merely black pepper and red pepper flakes. Collards were bland and tasted as if they were sitting in vinegar to help with the flavor, but the vinegar was overpowering. You know great collards from first bite and these weren't it. 
Staff is not attentive. Fried items are cooked per order, which is great; however, if you're going to do so please for goodness sake watch the fryer. My fried chicken (white meat) was over cooked. The ends were burnt and not chewable. Overall the food was underwhelming. Mac and cheese is good and the Arnold Palmer drink is good (if it's mixed/proportioned well). If you like soul food imitators that capitalize off the words \"soul food\" but fail to deliver soul food cuisine this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I was hoping for better based on the reviews.  The food was served buffet style and was cold."}
{"text":"Soul Central is good ole home cooking. Comfort food at its finest. Shout out to Frankie G for putting this place on my radar. When the self-proclaimed meatloaf connoisseur says they have one of the best in town, you've got to go try it. 

Is he right? Well, every time I go I tell myself to order a different protein. However, I just keep ordering the meatloaf. I can't seem to quit it. I love the collard greens (so legit) and the mac n cheese. You can get a meal with a main, two sides, cornbread (get the jalapeno), and tea for about $10. Great deal. You can also place a pickup order here on Yelp. 

There's a few seats inside, but I recommend getting it to go. I mean, the only thing that makes soul food like this even better is being able to eat it on your couch while wearing sweatpants."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout via Postmates because there was a special online. I ordered the jerk chicken, mac & cheese, yams and cabbage for dinner and sweet potato pie for dessert. The jerk chicken didn't look as I expected- more of a bbq chicken with a little jerk seasonings; but was still tasty! The Mac and cheese was sooo good! I love when the cheese is crispy at the top and still ooey-gooey. The yams were ok, seemed like there was something missing. The cabbage was horrible! There's noooo seasoning used whatsoever. I ate one bite and wanted to spit it out. Not what I was expecting at all! But the sweet potato pie was delicious! I would order again - probably double mac and cheese though!"}
{"text":"We got delivery through Postmates, taking a chance based on great Yelp reviews and word-of-mouth.  In short, I'm very upset that we waited so long to try this place out.  We got the fried fish, meatloaf, collards, and mac & cheese.  The collards were cooked PERFECTLY.  I'm a big fan of serious Southern collards - should be a little sweet, a little tangy, and most importantly, spicy - and these collards delivered.  I'm usually not a huge fan of meatloaf, but I will definitely be ordering that next go around.  In spite of the major meatloaf plate envy, I enjoyed the fried fish, as well.  Perfectly breaded and fried: not greasy, and not heavy.  The mac & cheese tho???  The BEST I've had in the neighborhood.  This is real mac & cheese, y'all.  The cornbread was fluffy and sweet; the perfect addition to the other elements on our plates.  We finished with the apple cobbler, which had just the right ratio of apples and crust.  Magic.  Even the sweet tea was good.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is my go to soul food restaurant. Anything fried is cooked to order so be prepared to wait. The service is awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, looks are definitely deceiving. This store front is almost invisible on Central ave., found on \"yelp\" gave it a try & was floored. Best Mac & cheese EVER, bbq chicken & homemade mashed pot. & gravy, let's not forget the sweet jalape√±o cornbread. Staff, super friendly. We will definitely be back. Southern grub at its finest."}
{"text":"So I heard about this place a few times and my wife and I stopped by. The crew is friendly and made us feel at home the food simply amazing definitely going to become a regular"}
{"text":"It says its southern food, from were, it's decorations are middle Eastern but it's a soul food restaurant, the place is really small, it should be take out only, the on thumb up is the pinto beans and cornbread was OK, let's go down hill from that, the chicken was tasteless and dry, sage dressing was not cooked and way to much sage, Mac and cheese was flat out bad, runny and the pasta was mushy, may won't to get a better recipe or don't sell it(gross),and when you arr talking to customers maybe you should not be eating that's gross and you don't get the order right, I asked for unsweetened tea to go and go sweet tea, it's not a true southern soul food"}
{"text":"This is great spot for home cooked food with fast, friendly service and decent prices.  The staff is helpful and nice.  

You choose your food from a buffet-like window and then you can take it to go or eat there, although tables are limited.  It's a small, but cozy space with a few tables outside and in. 

I had the meatloaf twice and loved it!  It's even better the next day for leftovers!!!  I also enjoyed the mac & cheese, cabbage, black eyed peas, curry potatoes (Sat only) and candied yams.  You get a meat and two sides, plus cornbread for $9.  Try the jalape√±o cornbread!!! It's beyond delicious.  Check in on YELP for a cool, satisfying sweet tea.

P.S. The veggies are not cooked with animal fat"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was really good. The selections were nice and everything tasted great. I had beef tips with rice, Mac n cheese, and cabbage. They even make their own hot sauce. The staff here was really nice and attentive. I must say I'm glad I went and definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try some new soul food."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is for real. Was sent here by some locals down the street, and I was impressed. I had the fried chicken with macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. The chicken was delicious, crisped to perfection. I love the mashed potatoes, they reminded me of steakhouse mashed potatoes. The Macaroni and cheese was delicious but the noodles were a little soft. The cornbread they serve with it, was sweet as cake. I liked it. Overall I was very impressed with the food and everything. The staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"I had a chicken breast and wing, corn dressing, black-eyed peas, collard greens, and jalapeno cornbread.  It was all delicious and fresh, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate here today and picked up fried chicken wings, Mac and cheese, and collard greens. The 5 Wings are wing pieces. Also cornbread and a water (tea was an option). Not quite sure how I feel about the cornbread. It's so extra moist. Kinda tastes like a sweet piece of cake at first bite. It's better than a lot of places. The price was $9.50 but i was only able to eat half the food so I'm saving the rest for later. Nice spot and friendly people. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm from this country and so is my husband so everything about this spot is right up our alley. It isn't fancy or pretentious and we love that. I ordered the fried chicken after the gentleman working there told us that they drop it fresh when ordered. I went with the yams, collards and jalape√±o cornbread. My husband got the fried chicken with black eyed peas, mashed potatoes and gravy and jalape√±o cornbread. 

We were lucky to snag a spot at a table outside (the inside wasn't air conditioned) and happily waited the 15 minutes for our fresh chicken, which was so good! The item I loved most was the collards. They were so tasty and I literally could've eaten a bowl full of them. My husband raved about all of it and, as a fried chicken lover, deemed it one of the freshest and best he's had at a restaurant. We couldn't finish our meals because they were so filling, which is unfortunate because I had big plans to try one of their desserts. 

I'm looking forward to coming back soon and trying the pot roast or chicken and dumplings!"}
{"text":"Cool place, great food. Came for lunch and ordered the Jerk Chicken, and my father got the meatloaf. Both meals, the sides, and Banana Pudding for dessert were better than I could have imagined. Wish I had always realized this gem was around the corner, and I will now be frequenting this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Oooooooo-weeeeee! Now THATS a good mac n cheese. I haven't had the pleasure of tasting any of their proteins as I usually can't resist a southern veggie plate. A little mac n cheese (always a must) a little green ( cabbage or collards?! ) and a bean ( green, pinto or black eyed?!). Can't go wrong. Definitely the best mac n cheese I've had in Charlotte, the custard based kind as I don't have time for mere sauce variations. These are some of the best pintos I've had too, with a touch of spice just for something extra. Sometimes when I can't decide which bean I want the dude will let me go half n half. 
   Great food, great counter/ take-out service, great price and really conveniently located. I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, great customer service, and you get your food pretty quick. They have some really good Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Soul food like it's suppose to be!!!! TADOW!!!!!!!!!  

It's the real thing and real deal!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, stew beef, and collard greens! The cornbread and sweet tea were on point too!!"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious authentic food!!! Large portions for a low price without sacrificing quality. Recommend the meatloaf and fried chicken as well as the sides."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 
The staff is friendly and very professional! 
Everything is good! I went once and have been back at least once a week. 
The best thing is they don't use pork to season the vegetables."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, and I loved the workers. Cool peeps. I tried the meatloaf, mac and cheese, yams, chicken and dumplings, cornbread, and peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Soul Central has fast become one of my go-to's, for a quick home cooked meal. They're food always tastes fresh, the seasoning is on point, the portions are huge, and the staff is friendly and helpful. While not a vegan restaurant, they offer several vegan and vegetarian options, without skimping on the flavor. If you haven't tried it, you certainly should!"}
{"text":"The best southern food around. I go to school across the street and I have finally found a place that is delicious and affordable. You get a lot for your money. I got the BBQ chicken, cabbage, collard greens and cornbread with a sweet tea for $9. The cornbread was moist and everything was delicious. The restaurant is very clean and the customer service is superb. Highly recommend this place.  see you guys soon for lunch."}
{"text":"I am from Charleston, S.C and there food reminds me of home!!! I had the barbecue chicken,cabbage  and 1/2  string beans with baked Mac and cheese, corn bread and   sweet tea and lemonade mixed!!! Awesome food and customer service!!! I will be back and will also recommend others!!!"}
{"text":"Another great Charlotte treasure.     Kind of hidden near Tres Amigos.     The pot roast was melt in your mouth yummmmmmmmmm.    I tried the meatloaf also.   Dang!!!  Make me slap my momma!!!!       Sides of Mac and CHEESE  to die for,   black eyed peas with a few onions amazing.     Can't wait til we return .  And I know it will be sooooooon."}
{"text":"Southern cuisine at its best in somewhat of a \"strip mall\" environment. Proprietor and staff are excellent ambassadors for this Cafe. All great menu options but love the curry-based items best."}
{"text":"If you are looking for simple, quick soul food, this is the place for you.  Their chicken is just like somebody's granny made back in the day, greens are on point, but the cornbread could use a little work.  I like this place.  It's more of a take away place because there usually isn't a place to sit."}
{"text":"We tried Soul Central for the first time today after having it on our list of places to try for a while. We were not disappointed. I had the lunch special (1 meat, 2 sides) and chose the meatloaf with collards and mac & cheese. I also got the jalape√±o corn bread and sweet tea. For the price ($6.99 I believe) the portions were big. The meatloaf was tender and delicious. The mac & cheese and collards were equally as tasty. I'm always skeptical of corn bread at restaurants because most aren't good, however, to my surprise the jalape√±o corn bread was moist, sweet, with a little spice. We also tried the homemade hot sauces which were good. I would recommend Soul Central to anyone and will be returning."}
{"text":"What an incredible new addition to the neighborhood!!! Amazing soul food, tastes like home cooking. Had a jerk chicken, mac and cheese and green beans, all perfectly cooked and seasoned. The menu had a lot of good choices and the best part are the prices!!!
One of my new favorite places in town for sure."}
{"text":"Small restaurant ran by a small team with great soul food. Plate runs around 9-10 dollars and is a nice option for quick soul food in Charlotte. Super casual and it's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Soul Central will not disappoint.  My girlfriend and I stopped by for a late lunch this past Saturday and really enjoyed everything we ordered (ox tails, green beans, collard greens, roti, jalapeno cornbread, and banana pudding).  The food was well seasoned and the menu offers a lot of variety for everyone to enjoy.

This business is run by family and close friends and we were fortunate enough to meet the co-owner, his wife, and son who were all on site that day.  We all sat, talked, and laughed.  It was a pleasure meeting them.

Business was steady and the family greeted every customer with smiles and hellos as they came and went.  The entire staff was very friendly.

Everything looked delicious and we'll definitely return soon to try more items from the menu.

Be sure to support your local businesses, especially Soul Central.

Shout out to JoeDaBro.  Keep making those hits!  And most importantly, obey your parents.

{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!
We just found it on yelp and we'll definitely be back! David the owner/chef is awesome. The jerk pork chops were off the chain. We were too full to eat dessert; so we got two cobblers to go for later!!!"}
