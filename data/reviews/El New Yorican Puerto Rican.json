{"text":"This is seriously authentic Puerto Rican food!! Being a New Yorker myself, I was beyond excited when we found this place.  I've taken family here to eat when they come to visit.  We went for my son's 2nd birthday and they surprised us by bringing out a serving of flan with a candle and all the staff sang Happy Birthday to him... this was a real treat!!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went there today and got the Mofongo Carne Frita. I have been wanting to try Mofongo for years. I love plantains and I LOVE THIS DISH! Had the Flan and it was also delicious!  The service was a bit relaxed and slow for American standards, but the staff was friendly and the food fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Never had puertorican food before and the food was phenominal and the owner was extremely personable.  What a TREAT, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I have visited several times now and the food has been really good! I loved the pernil (slow cooked pork) very tender, the beef stew and shrimp dish were both really good. I've also tried the fried chicken, and while it was certainly moist, it lacked any sort of flavor. Also, the cuts of chicken I received seemed quite boney. I had to pick my way around the bones to get much meat. I would've at least liked to have had part of a chicken breast, something meaty. Both rice selections are good.  My only 2 complaints based on our visits:  1) I love that this is a family owned business, BUT....we were very disappointed with the service of the young lady (a daughter, maybe??) that served us. She was not familiar with the ingredients/prep of the dishes. And while the owner happily came out of the kitchen to give us that info, the wait staff really should know it too. She was not attentive to our empty drink glasses, instead was chatting with other family members and texting on her phone. With only half of our meal gone, she asked us if we needed anything else....um, welllllll.......we're still eating! We can't really answer that yet! And when we were finished it took FOREVER to get her back over to our table to ask her about dessert. Bottom line, even family members need training if the restaurant is going to be successful long term.  2) Please provide a drink menu! Even if it's just written on a chalk board on the wall. We have never been informed of any specialty drinks available on any of our visits. Just \"Can I get you something to drink?\" If I was a business owner I would see this as a great opportunity to add some extra $$ to a customer's tab! I see other people with interesting drinks on their tables....if I was actually told what was available, I would be spending the money to try one of those drinks instead of sticking with water.  Overall, we've been pleased with the food. The Tostones are to die for....eat what they provide when you sit down and just go ahead and spend the $2 on a full order...trust me, you'll eat them all and thank me later! Both desserts tres leche cake and the flan are delicious! We have found the serving sizes to be perfect. Hubby is satisfied but not overstuffed and I always bring home some of mine for lunch the next day.  It's nice to have a quality restaurant in this part of town!"}
{"text":"The ownership is new, it is now called The Puerto Rican latin Grill. The food is awesome, the soup is like my Grandmother used to make. Brought back many memories of my childhood and my Father's cooking as well. The only downside for me is when I ordered the penil (Pork shoulder) they did not have any cuero (skin or pork rind). Other than that the music, atmosphere and hospitality is like being at home with the family."}
{"text":"Great little family owned restaurant.  Dropped in for lunch with a co-worker.  Pricing is reasonable for the large portions.  The pork shoulder was tender, moist and delicious.  My friend had a shrimp dish that she enjoyed quite a bit.  The wait staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.  Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"First: There is new management and a new owner and a new name. It is now called Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill. This name is a misnomer because there is NO bar. Second: (and most importantly) the food is fantastic. The menu has just enough meals to satisfy anyone who craves some Puerto Rican food when good ole mom is far away. In the past I've had the Mofongo with Carne Frita. Mofongo was awesome but the Carne Frita was cut into large pieces and overlooked.  I just had the Pernil w/arroz con gandules and its worth recommending. Service is good although sometimes a bit slow. The new owner is a friendly fellow but sometimes goes a little overboard in continuing to talk to you well into your delicious meal. That's just my opinion so take it for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to come here to this restaurant for a year! I was given a flyer by the owner at the Puerto Rican festival and knew I had to come. Puerto Rican food is so hard to come by in AZ, and great Puerto Rican food is even rarer.   I arrived for lunch on Wednesday and was greeted by a smiling face and great conversation by our waitress- the sister of the owner. The music was amazing, you wanted to get up and baila right there in the middle of the floor! For lunch time, the food does take a little ling to come to you, so if you are on an hour lunch break, I may suggest you call ahead? However, they bring complimentary tostones (fried masked green plantains) to your table for your wait.  The food was all I had hoped for! Being Puerto Rican, I am a huge critic of my style of cooking. I ordered an alcapurria which made my mouth sing and the MOFONGO was out of this world amazing. Not even when I visited Puerto Rico last year, did I get such a moist and flavorful Mofongo Solo. Because I am so use to it being a little dry, I automatically asked for a salsa before I even tasted it, but the ajo sauce she brought got neglected, because it didn't need to touch my moist mountain of platano and chicharronnes! I was in heaven for an hour, with my malta for a drink and a clean environment to eat! My one disappointment were the pasteles, which I was looking forward to. They were very bland for my taste. The owner said that he has modified his recipe to accommodate guests whose palettes are not as use to the strong flavors as we are. As much as I can sympathize, i feel that is a mistake. When someone comes to eat another culture's dishes, they must understand the flavors and spices used to create it, are what makes the dish authentic. Although an Indian food restaurant may make their buffet food with less heat to accommodate the masses, it still has the same flavors and spices, just not the heat. The ingredients in a pastele needs the salt and adobo that this was lacking. I don't think you get the same result if you have to add topical salt.   Bottom line- Will I be back? YES, with bells on- it was fantastic!  This time I will skip the pasteles, sadly, but happily order everything else! I'm excited to try dinner.   If you want to try them out- go to the Puerto Rican Festival this month in Tempe- they will be there as a vendor. ALSO, BEGINNING ON MAY 20TH THEY WILL ONLY BE OPEN FROM THURSDAY THRU SUNDAY."}
{"text":"The El New Yorican is no more. It is under new ownership and a new name, which I think is Puerto Rican Restaurant. We had a Groupon which I bought in May and was due to expire so we thought we'd give it a try. The bride was a little apprehensive because of the neighborhood, but when we walked in the door we were pleasantly surprised. It was clean, bright, modern and comfortable with a friendly staff that greeted us at the door. They came to take our drink order and we were a little surprised that they didn't have iced tea! Who doesn't have iced tea in AZ? So we settled on soft drinks, the standard Diet C for the bride but I decided to take a walk on the wild side and ordered a coconut soda. I was expecting it to be sickeningly sweet but it had a more subtle taste and was really quite refreshing.  We started with Platanos Maduros (sweet fried plantains) and before it even arrived they brought us another plate of Tostones Al Mojo (twice fried plantain with garlic butter) compliments of the house. Both were excellent with the subtle seasoning common to Puerto Rican food. I had the carne guesada (beef stew) which is basically tender beef in a savory broth, while the bride had the camarones al ajillo (sauteed shrimp in garlic) & for the sides we both opted for the arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas) and beans which came in a broth. Those not familiar with Puerto Rican food may expect a heavier hand with the seasoning, but common everyday cooking is much like the food in the midwest. The more spicy dishes are commonly served more in the areas frequented by tourists. This was definitely more country side cooking than spicy urban fare. All in all, the food was good, the prices were very reasonable and the service was pretty much topnotch. Not only would I go back but I'd recommend it to friends. As far as I know they don't serve any alcohol and as I said earlier NO ICED TEA! A word to those who are bitching about them not taking your Groupon. Get over it! You bought it in May and have had plenty of time to use it. If you were that eager you would have gotten there sooner. Besides, all you have to do is contact Groupon and they'll refund your money. Restaurants go out of business all the time so grow up and deal with it already."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this restaurant and this is one of the best things that could have happened.  Coming from the East Coast I have been missing the comforts of Puerto Rican food as it takes me back to when I vacationed there.    El New Yorican is a gem that much needs to be found and shared with others."}
{"text":"Definitely eat here! The food was delicious. This is a small, family-run restaurant with synthetic, and very tasty, Puerto Rican food.  I am not familiar with Puerto Rican food, but my friend who was with me grew up there and says it's just like home.  I thought the flavors were fantastic.   Because it was our first time there, the server brought us a small selection of samples which I've never seen a restaurant do. All of samples were delicious.   We ordered fried plantains, Puerto Rican style empanadas (postelillos?), fried chicken, beef stew, rice and beans, mofongo, fried pork chops, and flan.  Being non-Purrto Rican, I forget the PR names of those dishes. Most were yummy. There were three of us, and we all left with takeout containers.    I really think people should try this food and support this restaurant. I hope it stays around for a long time.  I want to give this place 4.5 stars, but I rounded down because it's not perfect.  The fried chicken looked unappetizing, and my friend who ordered it did not eat much of it.  The mofongo was a little too garlicky for me, but it was perfect for my PR friend. He said it was better mofongo than he's ever had because he's used to it being dry, but this mofongo was perfect for him.   Overall, you should eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful comfort food!  We had the tostones al moja for an appetizer - delicious with the ketchup based dipping sauce.  Next we had the mofongo topped with the camarones en salsa criolla - Wow!  This was fantastic!  My only suggestion would be less mofongo (it was a huge mound of the delicious mashed plantains) and more shrimp.  We also had pernil with rice and beans.  The pork was tender, flavorful, and wonderfully aromatic.  The rice and beans were good but did not stand out on their own right.  For beverages we had the Puerto Rican sodas: Coco Rico and Malta.  Fantastic!  The Coco Rico is like a coconut flavored cream soda and the Malta, molasses based, is hard to describe other than it did taste like molasses and I really enjoyed it.  Neither were overly sweet.  The service was very fast and very friendly.  We almost felt like we were over to their house for dinner.  We always like it when the owner or chef comes by to the table and Mr. Rivera did not disappoint.  The setting is very spacious and nicely decorated.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I am a Nuyorican - a New York Puerto Rican - and I approve this restaurant. I heard about the restaurant from a neighbor and, of course, had to try it out right away. To sum it up in two words: GREAT MOFONGO  First - without even trying the food first - I would give 5 stars just for the service. I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted to sit down. I ordered take out, but said I would wait for it. The waitress was so friendly and wanted to talk to me about how good all of the food was. She told me about the specials. I didn't know what one of them was, so she had the chef bring a small bowl of it for me to try. It was sancocho, a beef and vegetable stew, and it was delicious. Then, a few minutes later, the waitress brought me a small plate of tostones  (fried plantains) on the house. I was sold...  I ordered a couple of dishes so the family could sample the offerings. The tostones and maduros (sweet plantains) were perfectly done, as was the pasteles. The mofongo (mashed  plantain with garlic) was out of this world and served with crisp fried pork. We also tried the pollo frito with rice and beans (the kids loved the beans almost as much as the maduros) and the peril (slow roasted pork) with arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas). All were excellent, freshly prepared, with excellent service.  This is a good family friendly restaurant run by a family and not by a corporation. Give them a try! My only gripe, it was a little warm so maybe the AC wasn't working so well, but they have been open for only two weeks so I am sure that will get ironed out.  Please give this restaurant a try. You will not be sorry. Buen Provecho!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Definitely NUYORICAN all the way!  As a new york transplant I can say that this is as good as it gets. The service is friendly and outgoing, the food is perfectly cooked, and the pricing is reasonable. I hope they get more business so they can be around for years to come! They even had \"real\" aguacate! Not the rinky dink mexican hass avocados, but the Caribean Florida ones! I hope they get Cola Champagne son  :)"}
{"text":"I saw this place on groupon but didn't actually purchase it. My friend and I wanted to get lunch and couldn't think of anything we wanted and she remember she wanted to try it. She's puerto rican so her expectations were high. Well this place met and exceeded those expectations! We were greeted by the owner \"Solo\" who was extremely friendly and his sister \"Sola\" was our server. She was friendly, soft spoken but nice. We ordered the pastelillos, my best friend's mom makes these at home and I LOVE them so I was worried these wouldn't taste even close but they were DEAD on, I couldn't have asked for better. We also ordered the fried pork chops and grilled chicken breast with yellow and white rice. Everything was perfect! They can definitely count me in as a regular customer from now on! Only downside, their sodas come in a can with a glass of ice so there's no free refills."}
{"text":"Very good!!! Coming from Puerto Rico and having a part of home so far away!! Staff very friendly and courteous!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"On those very rare occasions the food over-rides other thngs. The food is fantastic. The location is perfect (for me) only draw back is the hours and the fact that they have little help. ....but I'm down for calling in for takeout!"}
{"text":"So some great Puerto Rican friends of ours told us about this local spot with authentic Puerto Rican food. With my wife being Puerto Rican, she's always looking for food like back at home. The restaurant was the perfect little cafe type restaurant. They had all of the PR favorites on the menu like Pernil, Mofongo, Chuletas (fried pork chops) and many other PR treats. I ordered the fried pork chops with arroz con gondulez (pigeon peas). It was perfect, couldn't have been better. My wife went with the Pernil with rice and beans. The pernil ranked up there with some of the best I've ever had! I also got a chance to try to the mofongo, which was amazing as well. All total, I think our bill was just over $20.   This is how you run a small local restaurant. The owner even allows you to use the place as a meeting spot at night. You can't bring in our own food and drink but he doesn't charge you to use the restaurant. He only asks that 35 plates be purchased, which is not much. What a great idea for a family get together, domino tournament or any other reason to get a large group of people together for good food. Two huge thumbs up for El Nuyorican!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and found out that beginning the end of this month, they will only be open Thursday -Sunday or something like that.  (BUMMER)  So call before you go. Still same great food as always, but Pasteles need more salt.  Will not order them anymore if they don't have enough salt.   Sorry."}
{"text":"Oh to go to a restaurant and feel like I'm home. In 2 and a half years this is the 2nd Puerto Rican restaurant I've gone to. The food was incredible. The staff is friendly. I would've given this restaurant 5 stars but for the fact we were interrupted by someone scamming customers with a sob story for money. Not in the best neighborhood so I'd advise going during the day. But oh the food was so good. I plan to go back once a month for my fix. This restaurant puts Havana Café to shame. A lot to be said when you go to a restaurant that runs out of dishes because it's made fresh everyday. Not a big menu which makes everything tastes so much better."}
{"text":"We had the BEST Puerto Rican meal in a restaurant, ever!  We are thrilled that Alberto opened this joint and serves such delicious, authentic, and reasonably priced food.  The staff is so friendly and accomodating.  We ordered almost every appetizer on the menu and loved them all.  The pernil tasted just like my tio's back in Arecibo PR.  The flan was the perfect sweet touch to end a rich and savory dinner.  We already have plans to return next weekend with friends."}
{"text":"Best, authentic Puerto Rican food outside of my mother's kitchen.  The owner/operator and his staff make you feel like part of the family.  I would absolutely recommend this to any and everybody, whether you're just stopping in for a quick lunch or out to dinner for a special occasion.  No place better for a taste of home cooking!!!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place tonight. We have been waiting years for a puerto rican restaurant in Phoenix. My husband is from PR and loved this place (so did I)!   We had tostones, mofongo, pollo, arroz con gandules, and flan. EVERYTHING we had was delicious. Fresh and flavorful, home cooked. We will be back here often.   The place itself was clean and comfortable. The owners and staff were all incredibly friendly from the second we walked in."}
{"text":"Found out about this restaurant from groupon; a good find. Pernil is the best outside of NYC or San Juan! the tostones are wonderful; garlic shrimp were delecious!! arroz con gondules was yummy.pastellious were a little bland but otherwise no complaints. A friendly, family oriented restaurant. Please go."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be back. Having had genuine Puerto Rican food in New York from my wife's family I can say that this is authentic and tasty. In fact the mofongo with shrimp my wife ordered was actually the best I've had. I had the shrimp criolla which was also good. The service was attentive and you could see that the owner and staff were veryi interested in keepng us satisfied. The platanos maduros were sweet and moist. The free appetizer of tostones with garlic and oil were a nice surprise. We saw other diners with sides of sliced avocado and asked for a couple of slices as we love them as sides. By then we were approaching being stuffed but as this was our first visit we had the flan for dessert. Very nice. We ended up having a good conversation with the owner and it is apparent that  they take real pride in their operation and are open to feedback. This is the first time I've written a review in Yelp but this place deserved it. We will be back."}
{"text":"The reason this didn't get more than 3 stars is the simple fact the service lacked. Stopped in last sat night arnd 7 pm hoping to get a quick casual meal. The place was busy! It just got busier and busier as we sat there. They were definately not expecting it and it showed. My husband and I both ordered fried chix. Really good but not crusted the way you are used to. I also didn't see a drink menu, yet people had beer, smoothies etc.. So they NEED a drink menu. It was pure chaotic and waited over 20 min for a check at a casual eatery after flagging down his young son that works there, Not acceptable."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I ate here recently and was told by the new owners that they just purchased the place a few weeks ago.  They were very nice and it was clear they care about their restaurant and want to do their best.  They also provided us with some free appetizers of fried plantains with olive oil and diced raw garlic.  It was weird because the plantain was extremely bland and the garlic was very pungent but this cuisine was new to me so I went with the flow.  Also, the service was mostly attentive but no one seemed to know who was doing what job so we had 3 different people asking us what had and had not been done.  Then the horror began.  I ordered the $10 fried chicken with rice. The chicken itself was of very poor quality and included 2 drumsticks and 2 pieces of the rear dark meat that included the actual spine of the chicken.  It was a little bizarre seeing each and every vertebrae of the chicken I was about to eat and while I try to be fairly open-minded about what I'll try, this was unexpected and unappetizing.  When I tried the drumstick it was clear that the chicken was not seasoned before it was fried and it was very overcooked.  It was the worst friend chicken I've had in recent memory.  The rice was good but give me a break, rice is rice.  My buddy ordered the $10 pork with mofongo, a dish made of mashed and fried plantains.  The pork was also unseasoned and deep fried for far too long.  It was terrible.  I've read that mofongo is often served with a sauce over the top.  In this case, the sauce they chose was only butter.  There was so much butter the mofongo and pork were basically marinating in plate full of it.  The mofongo had an interesting texture but was also very bland, even with the overabundance of butter.  Overpriced and disgusting.  If this is normal for Puerto Rican food please let me know so that I can avoid this country and its cuisine like the plague.  I appreciate the dedication of the new owners but some serious changes need to be made.  I am thoroughly displeased and will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I ordered Pernil with Mofongo and 2 alcapurrias to go. 5 stars for the food - it was delicious although slightly overpriced. However, it took over 45 minutes for my food to be ready, which I didn't appreciate. There were people who arrived to dine in after I had placed my order and even they got their food way before me. They most likely completely forgot about my order."}
{"text":"Food baby alert!  Finally there are Puerto Rican restaurants popping up in Phoenix! It's about time! If you've never had PR food, it can be best described as stick-to-your-ribs Caribbean inspired dishes (with lots of pork and plantains). You better like garlic and onions, and you better not be afraid of eating fried food. If you have those bases covered, you're all set for some good eatin'!   *Side note: Everything seems made to order, so be a little patient while it cooks! =) *  I personally got the chulettas fritas(fried pork chops), and they were on point with what I would expect! The red beans and rice that came with my chops though were what I couldn't get enough of! The creamy red beans with chunks of potatoes went so well with the rice.. I could have eaten a tub of it!   Their mofongo also blew me away! Mofongo is made with mashed plantains, and the serving is hearty! Imagine chunky mashed potatoes with a few fried pieces mashed up in there for texture, and you might start getting an idea. Oh, and like I said before, be sure that you like garlic! The mofongo is loaded with it! Each bite has powerful garlic flavor (maybe wait to take a date here until you know them a little better...haha).  I tip my imaginary hat off to El New Yorican! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We loved it!  My wife is Puerto Rican and I am Mexican, but I can cook some mean Latino food!    The food was unreal!  Lots of Garlic and Onions!  YUMMMY!  The owner and his sister are very friendly and they have an amazing vision for this place.  You need to visit this place!  You will feel at home, even if you are not Puerto Rican!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect.  Everything from the decor, to the music playing, the service and the food was perfect.  So many restaurants think they know what Puerto Rican food is but they always fall short.  As a Puerto Rican far from home and from my mother's cooking this restaurant was a breath of fresh air and made me feel like I was right back at her dining room table.  I would absolutely recommend this to any and everybody.  I will definitely be back over and over again!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow...WOW!  Amazing food, great atmosphere and outstanding service!  I have been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time and finally made time to go try it earlier today. I was blown away by the welcoming service that Alberto provided to me. He was so sincere and nice with everything, he explained the drinks and menu to me.  I started off with a smoothie like drink called 'Beso' something, he told me the name like three times but for the life of me I don't recall the other part. Very tasty smoothie with different fruits. Complimentary they gave fried plantains with a garlic sauce which were to die for. I also ordered the Platanos Maduros, which are friend sweet plantains, DELICIOUS is the only way to describe those. For my main entree I ordered the Pernil which is slow roasted pork with a side of yellow rice. I seriously could not have been happier with my whole meal. I could honestly say at that very moment I would have died a VERY happy person. :)  Other than the great food, Alberto was soooo nice with everything. He even gave me a little taste of a molasses drink that he said most people don't like, but I really liked it, very good and different in taste. Not for everyone, but I did enjoy it.  I will definitely come back soon, probably next week with the whole family. He did mention that they have live music and salsa dancing on Saturdays from 6-8PM, so I definitely would love to check that out."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The food is great, just like my pops used to cook. The service is friendly. And they're relatively cheap for what you get. It's hard to find good Puerto Rican food anywhere but El New Yorican is a nice place to have a great dinner in a clean and happy restaurant. We love it."}
{"text":"What's better than Mofongo con carne frita, tostones, pasteles, arroz con gandules and a cold Malta India??? Of course Flan :) and if that's not enough add an excellent service!!! Nice place to hang out with the \" Puerto Rican family\" Nothing compares with The Boricuas.."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to my House\", said Chef Alberto as he shook my hand and greeted me upon arriving. I love the name of this restaurant, very creative. Could it be that they're Yankee fans, I think so as I spied a New York Yankee cap in the kitchen. The piped in music is lively and upbeat which makes you want to dance, and at the right sound level so that you can have conversations with your dinner companions.  On to the food - I dined here with a few Yelpers and we had a great time. Just about every appetizer was ordered. I really enjoyed two appetizers in particular. The Pastelillos, which is a beef empanada and the Platanos Maduros which was the fried sweet plantains (like bananas).  For the main course I ordered the Carne Guisada ($9.99), which is Beef Stew. This came with rice on the side which I put into my bowl of Beef Stew to soak up the juices of the Beef Stew. The Carne Guisada was excellent along with the service.  And of course, kudos to Chef Alberto!"}
{"text":"As a Puerto Rican living in Phoenix, the food sitauation can sometimes be a little sad.   There have been a few attempts at Puerto Rican dining over the years - and frankly- I'd rather just cook at home than eat there most of the time.   Not the case with El New Yorican.  DELICIOUS.    FRESH.   Tostones were perfect.   Malta India?  Yes.    Mofongo?  Yes.      It's out of my way, but I will go back .  A lot."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  I love Puerto Rican food and I went here with a buddy who lived in south Florida for over three years.  My wife is Puerto Rican and I always loved the way her family cooked.  Being from NJ you can always get good eats.  Now in AZ you can get some great Puerto Rican eats.  I get to the restaurant and the owner greets my buddy and I .  He was extremely friendly and gave us a sample of the pork shoulder.  Once I had the sample I knew what I was eating for lunch.  Then we got some Apps and they were great.  The lunch came  this is coming from two guys that  can eat with the best of them and we were not able to finish our food there was so much to eat.  For under 10 dollars you get all this good I mean great food.  My wife was not able to make it so she asked me to get her some take out If I forgot the take out chances are I would be sleeping in the spare bedroom for a few days.  So we are eating good tomorrow as well.  The dessert was over the top good.  The Flan was good sized and only 2.50 cents.  Usually going out to eat I spend 8 bucks on dessert.  My bud got chocolate cake with cookies and cream ice cream in the middle.  I took some of his and that was the bomb.  If I did not live in Anthem I would have got some to go.  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone you likes or loves Puerto Rican food.  Great food, excellent service, and a owner that cares that the customers and his employees are treated correctly. This will be a place I will continue to go back to at least 2 times a month.  This is top three eats spot in Phoenix so far for me."}
{"text":"Warning: this review may leave you with some serious garlic breath.   It was my first experience with Puerto Rican food and I must say, I was definitely impressed! After fighting traffic to get from Scottsdale to 27th Ave and Thomas, I arrived ready and eager to consume some Puerto Rican cuisine. I was greeted with some fried plantain accompanied by dipping sauce that had been \"dipped\" with plenty of garlic. I was too late to order appetizers, but my group was kind enough to share with me so I got to taste the Pastelellos which are ground beef empanadas, pasteles which are wrapped green bananas stuffed with meat, and Plantanos maduros which are fried sweet plantains. Each was just as delicious as the last and to be honest, I would have been happy with just a couple appetizers. However, what's a visit to a Puerto Rican restaurant without having an actual meal!   I took the advice of some pros and ordered the Mofongo Carne Frita. Now be warned, this dish comes with a small mountain of mashed plantains that taste like they have been soaking in garlic for weeks. Don't get me wrong, the mashed plantains are delicious, but it's important to be prepared to consume those calories and you probably shouldn't plan on doing anything with anybody afterward since you will smell like 20 garlic cloves. This meal also comes with fried pork which is good but a little dry so definitely ask for a side of their version of chicken broth to dip. The meal was good, but a little rich for me and since I had to join those who hadn't been dining on garlic after, I limited the amount of mashed plantain I ate.   My experience was delightful and I was impressed with the staff, the service and the food. Next time, I will probably get something lighter such as one of the Plato Principal Main Dishes, but all in all, I had a great time!  Directions: This place is a little hidden, but if you're coming from the East, it will be just past 27th Ave and once you've gone past the freeway, on your right. It's in the same center as a pawnshop and you'll see a Puerto Rican flag out front."}
{"text":"The food here was really great and true to the Puerto Rican tradition. This place reminded me very much of my childhood in New York even down to the music. My boyfriend and I had a pastelillo, a pastel, and an alchipurria (sp?) for appetizers. I REALLy enjoyed the pastelillo, I would just call it an empanada. The ground beef was seasoned perfectly and I will definitely go back for one of these. I've never been a fan of pasteles, but my bf enjoyed it. The other item (alchurria?) was very tasty but also very greasy.  For our main course we had the mofongo with shrimp and the bistec encebollado with white rice and red beans. The mofongo was great but the oil-based sauce that the shrimp were in was NOT. The mofongo and shrimp were drowned in a sea of semi-bland oil. Next time I would try the mofongo with chicken as another reviewer said this was delicious, hopefully it comes in a different sauce. The bistec was good, not great, but it is something that I might order again (hopefully this time was a fluke). The rice and red beans were delicious, and almost the highlight of the entire meal. A good plate of rice and beans is really hard to come by in AZ. I can get by on the refried beans sold in most restaurants, but these kidney beans are really what my heart desires.  The restaurants white and black sign doesn't really stand out in the mini-mall that they are tucked away in, but keep a look out for the Puerto Rican flag flying out front. Everything is ridiculously affordable, especially for the huge portions they give you.  I have to say something about the service. I love that this is a family-owned restaurant, but the service was terrible. I believe that the owners two daughters are the servers and also the cashiers and they were really unprofessional and really slow. Without showing us a drink menu or at least describing what drinks they had to offer, one of them asked us what we wanted to drink. After she took our order I gazed around at the tables and saw a couple drinking Coco Rico (one of my favorites) and my boyfriend noticed a man drinking beer (it turned out to be a Malta). We ordered one of each, but even a simple sign on the wall listing the drinks available would help clients choose something other than water and up their sales. In the end they never brought us our tab. We had to walk up  to the cashier (after waiting more than 15 minutes) and ask for our bill. I think the girls are too young for this type of responsibility. They are just too distracted to wait tables.  All in all, I would go back, I still LOVE Puerto Rican food and there are only one or two restaurants like this in the valley, but next time I would order a pastelillo, rice and beans, and a malta and THATS IT... and I would bring a book so that I don't get impatient waiting for my server."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious!  My friend recently moved here from the Bronx and he said he already found a place that makes the perfect Puerto Rican food - this place is mmm mmm good.    When I sat down I asked the server what she recommended and she started off by  saying that the pernil had been slow roasted for 14 hours - I didn't have to hear more, that was what I was getting.  She also brought out some plantanos with some oil and garlic, very tasty.  Her suggestion did not disappoint, the pork was so tender and flavorful.  The service was outstanding!  I loved my server, so funny and attentive.   I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Pernil cooked to perfection served with arroz gandules and crispy tostones such sabor criollo! This place is wonderful for PR food and the vibe is authentic, go and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"We tried El New Yorican because it came up as an option on Restaurant.com and I checked their ratings on Yelp. I was very impressed with the place. The staff was very welcoming and even brought out a few samples for us to try since we were not familiar with Puerto Rican cusine. It turns out that many of the dishes were very familiar from other parts of the world. There were some dishes that were similar to Cuban, some more traditional American dishes... The owner came over to the table and explained the menu and made some recommendations. They were out of the Pernil (Slow Roasted Pork) but we did get to sample it and it was very good. In the end we ordered the Bistec Encebollado (Sauteed Steak and Onions) and the Carne Guisada (Beef Stew). Both had great flavor and went well with the Yellow Rice and Pigeon Peas (A variety of Pea not at all related to the bird). We also had the Pastelillos (Ground Beef Empanadas) which were a favorite and the Alcapurias also good. For desert we both had the Flan which was very good. The place is a nice traditional family owned restaurant. The menu has a limited number of items but everyone should find something they like. There was a diverse mix of people and the place was pretty full for a Sunday night. They also had a large number of to go orders. Most of the entrees were $9.99 which included your choice of rice and peas or beans. Ask for a sample if you are unsure which to order. The appetizers and deserts were very affordable each around $2.50 - $3. Give El New Yorican a try and you may also find yourself wanting to take a trip to Puerto Rico."}
{"text":"I met with a group of Yelpers here for dinner.  The nice thing about a group is, with the right mix of folks, you get to try a bunch of everything.  I think I had some of 5 different appetizers and 6 different entrees.  Everything I had was delicious!  My choice of entree was the chicken stew, complete with bones and bay leaves which had to be picked out.  The owner and his sister were really great hosts and we couldn't have been treated any better.  The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is the recruitment of folks to leave Yelp reviews, I hope some of those folks get involved further in Yelp."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fantastic food! This is a great hole in the wall type of restaurant where you feel like family and the food is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food and great music!  We inhaled a lot of food: Tostones - The best! Pasteles - Wow, it was good! Pastellos - OMG, so good!  And the pastry was light and crispy. Pernil - The best dish as far as I am concern!  The flavors and tenderness. Mofono with Chicken - Mofono was great and the chicken was very tasty & moist Chuletas Fritas (prok chops) - It was a little dry. Arroz con Gandules - Yellow rice and peas (YUMMY)!"}
{"text":"Ok this review is not about the food!I had loved to try it. I arrived there yesterday for lunch.We love Puertorican cooking.I got 2 coupon as a gift trough groupon.It was a gift for my husband who didn't get his mofongo as often as he liked too since he left puerto rico. The waitress, kinda stressed stressed out,  approached us and i showed her the coupon. Ammmphh, we don't take those:she sayed. Me: How come? They are two days old and fully payed and advertised from your restaurant!. She went back with the owner which rolled her eyes on us..sorry we are new owners since 3 days, we don't take those! I send away already 4  people!..rolling eyes.  OOOOK,.  ???Lady....you are not that smart u refused 4 more party's ore more because u would have to give a mofongo for free.I heared the food should be really good. I had might come  back, so the others. I drove 30 min there?not again sorry! I had at least spend 25 $ more beside the coupon.Not smart at all. I know u gotta make a living.This place is familieowned.Iam not rich eather, but i know that if i have a new place...and wanna get people in..u gotta spend money to get money in!And work on the customerserviceskills. If she had tried to solve the issue the i might had stayed and dealed with groupon later.But if somebody gives me i don't give a beep answer as a manager..i don't stay no matter how hungry i was or how good the food had could been!  Like i sayed...this is only for the Customer-service cause i didn't get more far."}
{"text":"I am so glad I got here! I had the pulled pork shoulder with yellow rice and coconut soda - delicious. My wife was in heaven with the Shrimp in garlic butter and mashed twice-fried plantains with Molasses soda. The flan was also excellent. We'll be back ..."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant : but this is what i encountered: i had called on Sunday afternoon to see what time they were opened to and i was told 8:00 pm, so i got off work @ 6 and my son and i headed over there, we got there around 6:45 it was a long drive becasue we came from PV. As we drove into the parking lot we were greeted by a young man screeming at us they were closed.. So i step out of the car and asked why when a older gentelmen came towards me to tell me they were closing and i asked him why and he said they wanted to go home early, i said thats not good customer service and that we drove from across town and his comment to me was \"Oh Well\" I will never go back there what a way to treat a first time customer apparently they don't need the business"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of weeks ago with my husband for brunch as we were starving!  After reading the reviews of this place I really wanted to try this place out and we were in the area so I begged to go. As a Panamanian, I was nostalgic for some platano fritos and chuletas. Puerto Rican food is VERY similar to Panamian, if not practically the same thing. My mom is a bomb cook, so I was going to be very critical of this place even if it has had good reviews. Any who onto the reviewing!  Service: The owner was the waiter and helping out with the cooking. He was super friendly and ordered some patacones with garlic sauce on the house for us, so he gets props for that. He explained the drinks to us as they do not have a drink menu (weird). We received our drinks right away. Throughout the whole process he was excellent in describing the drinks and entrees so he gets major props for that.  Food: This is where I was really disappointed. Trust me, I really really wanted to like this place! I ordered the chuletas con arroz y frijoles (Fried porkchops with rice and beans). It was very overcooked, salty and super chewy, not good at all. My mom's chuletas are always crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. These chuletas were very tough, almost like jerky, very disappointing. The rice and beans were very good though! My husband ordered the pollo guisado with rice and beans (braised chicken), he was really looking forward to it as he has tried my mom's guisado and loved it. When he received his plate all of the chicken pieces very meatless, mainly bones with some meat and lots of skin, he even received the gizzards! Again, his chicken was very salty, he is usually not a picky eater and he was very disappointed. He couldn't eat the whole thing because it was too salty for him.   Overall I was very disappointed with the food in this place. I had very high expectations, especially since my mom is a fantastic cook and has cooked most of what was presented on the menu. Maybe I should have tried the mofongo that everybody was raving about, but a great restaurant will cook everything magnificently. The service was very good, the food very blah. I probably and most likely won't go back to this place since it's not close by, sorry!"}
{"text":"The food is bomb.com and they probably have the best service I've ever had at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just moved from Orlando, so I am so used to good Puertorrican food, when I found out about this restaurant, I didn't mind the drive (about 25 miles to get there)... First, it was very hard to find, because it has no sign outside... Once inside, a very friendy lady took my order, (I had a huge craving for Mofongo) and she said that I was going to love it!! (very promising!) also ordered plantains... When I tried the Mofongo, I was very, very dissapointed, it was dry, totally flavorless, no \"little pieces of crunchy pork\" that is so essencial in this dish, it only have a bed of grease on the bottom, so mainly, it was cooked mashed plantains, that's all... I am glad that I went myself first and didn't take my friend with me, I have talked to her so much about how delicious Puertorrican food is and don't want to dissapoint her taking her to this place. I hope the restaurant's new owners read this review and try to do something about their food, I wish them well, but I don't see them remain in business if they don't change the way they cook!!"}
{"text":"Totally authentic and I am a fan.  Small Family business while often unsuccessful, sometimes delivers an experience that you can't extract from the large chains. The friendly service, tasty food, and atmosphere here all make you feel like the ocean should be nearby.... no such luck in AZ though.   Everything was clean and well kept...  The music was loud and proud...  Honestly I just felt like I was on vacation with my wife and the food was quite good. We ordered tostones, mofongo, and fried pork chops with red beans and rice. Everything tasted great and came out hot and on time. People were dancing on the mini stage next to us while they waited for their order and I can't say I wasn't tapping my foot to the beat. The owner thanked me for coming once everything was wrapped up and cracked a few jokes to lighten the wait for the receipt.   This is the closest to what I have had in PR here in Phoenix and I would suggest it to anyone who wants to try something new. Great place I will defiantly be back, and hope you can enjoy it too.  It's cheap too! price point around 10-15 per head.  Only cons:  Neighborhood   you smelling like pork after leaving :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try Puerto Rican food, and this place came highly recommended by a friend of mine as being very authentic...and it was.  From the moment you walk in the door and hear the music, you're transported to a little neighborhood restaurant being run by a family.  The waitress who seated us brought out our drinks immediately, and answered any questions we had.  We decided to get a beef empanada to start off, then we got an order of pernil, which is slow roasted pork shoulder with yellow rice and a bean sauce/gravy, and a mofongo carne frita, which is mashed plantains with boneless pork chops.    We were brought out an order of tostones first, which were delicious!  Then our empanada, which was quite large, and perfect for us to share.  Our main dishes, were then brought out, and we both sorta ate off each other's plates.  I was surprised at how much we both enjoyed the mofongo...amazing!  Normally, plain plantains can be somewhat bland, but these had garlic/butter mixed in and were mouthwatering.  Everything was very good!  We were pretty full, but decided to split a flan for dessert, and I'm glad we did.  It was the perfect ending to our meal.  The prices are quite reasonable, considering the amount of food you get.  The restaurant is a bit out of our way, but I can definitely see us making another trip out this way very soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried any Puerto Rican place we come by and El New Yorican is DEF the best place in Arizona! so good, its even better than my mother in laws cooking! its amazing! You wont find anything better here. Its a great family owned restaurant, the brother and sister that handle the place are so welcoming and the place is real cozy! We love it! so far we've gone almost every weekend :p"}
{"text":"This place is the house of plantains. If you love plantains, you must come here. The Mofongo is magical, and I'd never had plantains served up like mashed potatoes before. (P.S. Plantains are filling. They blow up in your stomach. Stop eating before you feel full or it'll hurt to breath later.)  What is actually the best, though? The pernil. Their pork is legit. And I would recommend that above all else.  Now they just need to sell booze. The only thing that would've topped off the tasty food was nice Don Q Punch."}
{"text":"First time there and the food was really good, the service was great and the owners really make your that you are taken care of and want to hear what you have to say about their food.  Aw and the cake was oh so good, it is made with 3 different creams, so moist and very very delicious."}
{"text":"Yes....My review really went from 5 stars to 1. I would NEVER go back here again. I went today to use a Groupon that I have had for awhile that was expiring in the next week or so. Immediately after ordering I overheard the table next to us trying to use a Groupon and the waitress saying 'No we don't take those.' Umm...well you sold them, wtf? Apparently they are under a new owner as of a few days ago and no longer accept Groupons. This is total BS because I already ordered thinking that the meal was paid for. I was annoyed, but the last time I came it was SO good, so I was ok with it. I had ordered the fried chicken mofongo and the BF ordered the pulled pork shoulder (which was awesome last time). We also got some appetizer that is plantains wrapped around meat and fried or something. The app was oddly flavored. The meat was supposed to be beef, but I'm not sure that it was. My fried chicken consisted of unidentifiable parts of chicken on the bone including what looked like a vertebra (may or may not have been...) ummmm not awesome. It was more bone than chicken. The mofongo was dry and not very flavorful at all. The thing that got me the most, though, was the BF was brought chicken....clearly is was chicken. The chicken had no flavor or seasonings and was bland and disgusting. He asked the (very rude) waitress if it was the pork he had ordered and she said 'yes' and walked away. It was not. It did not even resemble the pork I had the last time we were there. At the end of the meal, as expected, they would not accept our Groupon. The bill was a ridiculous 25$. What happened to this restaurant??? I feel badly that I have to give such a negative review, but clearly the new ownership isn't working out so well and they should probably just close now while some people still have good memories of their restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy food coma I am in right now! Tonight a group of us came here in hopes of having some awesome Puerto-Rican food. Half of our group was Puerto-Rican. I had to laugh when we pulled up to the front and saw various Puerto-Rican flags showing through the window. The sure sign of proud Puerto-Ricans.   This place just opened a couple of months ago and looks to be family run. I could see them hard at work making the food from scratch. Along those lines, be prepared for a wait awhile for your food for that reason. I had some pork pastelillos which was ground pork in a fried empanada shell ($2) and pernil with arroz con gondules (pork with yellow rice and pigeon peas, $10) with pink kidney beans. I also tried some of the fried porkchop and mofongo. Everything I tried was delicious and the pernil was just like my mom makes. I realize now why I rarely eat rice and beans because I have no inner gauge telling me to stop eating! The rice was moist and when I added the kidney beans over it, I had a bottomless pit for it.   A couple of cute things I noticed: 1) they brought my daughter's water and food in pink plastic cups/plates that were similar to what she uses at home. I found that to be approachable and endearing. 2) The salsa/merengue music they were playing was from a boombox playing CDs (being manned by a guy dressed head-to-toe in Puerto-Rico clothes). I just loved that.   For a new place, this restaurant has fantastic things going for it. I gave it 4 stars because I think there are still some bugs to work out. If you go, know that you get your check and pay up front. We waited at our table FOREVER after eating because we were waiting for our checks. It would be nice if the server dropped off the check at the table and then you go up to the front and pay. The owner told us he rents out the facility for free for large groups over 35. Pretty cool.   Since this place is around the corner from my neck of the woods, I forsee food coma take-outs in the future..."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Mofongo with fried pork was delicious!! Also have some of the best flan around. Would definitely recommend this place and I'll be going back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I am not even sure what its called, but had these empanadas made with plantain dough filled with meat inside. Delicious! Everything my friend, my mom and  I had when we went was great! You will not be disappointed. I have several PR friends and they approve of the place as well!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, and the service was very good.  I don't think I'll go back because I wasn't hooked, but it's definitely a place worth checking out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is not what I was expecting. My mother is Mexican, which isn't Puerto Rican and I realize this, but I've known a few good Puerto Rican cooks. In Arizona, as many before me have said, it is hard to find good Puerto Rican food. It is even harder to find such warm and welcoming hosts.  My girlfriend and I decided to go here for dinner after seeing an article somewhere on the internet. The review sounded good, we had nowhere better to be, and we felt a little adventurous. Man, do I love it when being adventurous turns out this good, which is really rare.  I open the door to the sound of music and laughter. We were greeted by several, \"Welcome!\" 's and smiles. The night is off to a great start. We are seated promptly and there is a fairly large partly enjoying their meals. Our waitress was very friendly and jovial. More importantly though, she was prompt. We received our drinks shortly after being seated (who needs a drink menu with such great service? And while we are on the topic, I actually really do like the menu, just enough information, well organized, and it doesn't go overboard to where it is overwhelming). I asked about the stew, then before I knew it, I am sampling it. How often do you find that kind of confidence? While it was delicious, it wasn't quite what I was looking for and I went for the steak with sautéed onions. My girlfriend ordered the mofongo with shrimp (I cannot for the life of me remember what the true names of these entrées where). And if you are a coffee lover, they have some of the most incredible coffee I have ever had, but it might be a bit strong for some.  Hmm... I think I've gotten a little too excited here and maybe this review is starting to drag on. To just say everything was delicious would be too small and to say the service was outstanding would be a disservice to the wonderful people of El New Yorican. But I don't want to lose anyone that takes the time to read this. I have eaten at many, many restaurants in Arizona. This is now one of my favorites.  Will I return? Of course, yes.  Thank you guys for a great meal and a wonderful night"}
{"text":"Me and my husband ate their for the first time. The waitress was great. We told her we are First-timers, She came back with a plate of samplers for us to try. All of them were tasty.  We decided to order something we didn't sample.  I got garlic shrimp plate... It was more like shrimp in better sauce.  My husband order steak and onions.... Serving size kind if small...but the waitress hooked us up with a 2 slice.    My only complaint was the wait time for our ticket to pay.... About 20 mins... 3 other tables were in and out that had arrived after us.  We ended up going to the register to pay.  The cashier said be right back and started severing other tables... I felt as they didn't want my money after about 10 more minutes of standing waiting to pay...  I used my groupon with no problem.   Over all don't think we will be going back... Food was good waitress was great and friendly...the cashier needs to be replaced."}
{"text":"It's hard to find PR restaurants in AZ so when I heard about this place, I did a drive-by to make sure it was legit! Sure enough, it was/is! When my husband & I returned from our honeymoon in PR on 09/26, we came here the next day because we just couldn't get enough!  The prices are reasonable, the place is large enough to have a party and/or live music.    There are a few preferred items that are missing: papa rellenos and hibaritos specifically .  And I am hoping they will get a website soon too.  But nonetheless, this place has full flavor and I loved the staff.  As a matter of fact, I will be calling an order in for dinner tonite!!!"}
