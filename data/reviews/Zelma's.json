{"text":"Zelma's is now closed, we got one of their last five pizzas. The guy behind the counter said to look for a new place in March, they're apparently selling it."}
{"text":"We recently had my husband's birthday dinner here. I was really nervous that we'd get there and they might have lost our reservations. It was the weekend of the marathon and Ebertfest and I knew it'd be busy.   We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and everything was all set up for our party of 30. I was really relieved. They kept their word (not that I had any reason to think that they wouldn't).   Our server was Nikki and she did an amazing job. She took care of all 30 of us. I'm not sure how she did it, but she did! Very impressive, indeed! She was quick with drinks and she never seemed frazzled.   Our pizzas were awesome. The meat lovers was everyone's favorite. We got a vegetarian with artichoke hearts and onions and a Hawaiian that were awesome, too. The breadsticks are HUGE, too. We all left very full and with a ton of leftovers.   I was really satisfied with the service we had. I'd imagine that it's pretty difficult for one waitress to take care of 30 people, but Nikki did a great job. We usually have a pizza party for my husband's birthday every year. I think we'll be returning to Zelma's next year, too."}
{"text":"I've never met the owner, so I can't say anything about him or his managing. His son is incredibly nice and makes you feel like you're in a \"family restaurant\" for sure. Their main pizza's almost identical to Monical's (only slight variations), but half the price. If you like monical's but hate their prices, then go here."}
{"text":"Saw a coupon in the newspaper for a large 1 topping deep dish for $10 so decided to try their pizza for the first time. I wanted to pick up at 5:30 so I called at 4:15 to see how far ahead I should call for pick up at that time. No one answered so I checked the number, which was right and called again. This time someone finally answered. They said about 15 min to make the pizza & they took my order then for 5:30. I got there right at 5:30 but my pizza wasn't ready. At 5:45 I asked if it was going to be ready soon only to find out it had been done 5 min & just sitting there getting cold.  We liked the taste of the crust & pizza in general but at $2 for each extra ingredient & considering we got 5 total ingredients making it a $20 pizza, they were somewhat skimpy. It was ok but we won't be in a big rush to go back, especially due to the service. There are too many other good pizzas in this town & for the cost I'd rather have Old Orchard or Papa Dels."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The pizza is good, but service is lacking. It has been this way every time I have visited. Several months ago, our bills were higher than the menu price. Upon inquiring, we got the run-around. Finally the manager stated that the soft drink prices went up. He said they were not going to print new menus just for that! Finally they were printed. A few days ago, incorrect change was returned. On questioning, I was told the cash register made that determination. Ralph Monical was in (owner) so I requested his presence. He said he never looks at tickets and change, and was not concerned about it. He was very defensive and somewhat obnoxious as we discussed it. He never understood that I was trying to help by pointing out a minor problem. He looked at it as I was just a complainer. I don't think he cared at all that incorrect change was made. Others in our party had similar problems with their tickets. I am appalled that someone who ran an outstanding pizza chain, before he sold it, could have this don't care attitude. I wonder if this attitude carries through the food preparation as well. I don't care to return to find out. Be sure to check prices and change if you do go there."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for really good pizza and found myself at Zelma's.  We ordered a medium deep pan pizza, and it was disappointing.  It tasted like Pizza Hut (from what I can remember from childhood).  It was just kind of blah.  It was over-priced too, for the size of the pizza.  We were there at around 8:30 on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone else there.  It might be OK for other things on their menu, but I don't think I'll be going back for pizza."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here....I haven't tried anything else off of the menu yet (besides the waffle fries which were awesome, but I've never met a waffle fry I didn't like) but it all looks like pretty standard sports bar fare.  Lots of burger choices.  Service was attentive and quick and prices were reasonable.  I think we got a discount for only having one tab which was a very nice surprise!  I wish more places would offer that! I'm not such a fan of the interior.  It's pretty dark and can feel a bit cramped.  From now on, I'll probably order for take out, but I will return soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the restaurant and ordered out several times. I have nothing but praise for the food and its prices. They always have great deals on burgers and fries and I especially love the Bacon Cheeseburger because of the soft crowned bun that doesn't get soggy. The waffle fries are crispy and a great compliment to the burger.  The service has always been stellar when I've been there, but I've never seen a lot of traffic there on a Sunday afternoon. I'm surprised more people don't go here as it's a great place to go with all the food they offer."}
{"text":"Went there for pizza with some coworkers.  Our server was a very young woman (Ashley) who took great care of us.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  I had their Tuesday Special which was a large, one-topping pizza for $5 when you buy one alcoholic beverage.  The pizza was good.  Being an Italian from Brooklyn, NY, my standard are high for pizza.  This was good local pizza.  I would go here again if the occasion arose."}
{"text":"The service is OK, but the manager/owner is rude.  I'm not sure why this review was removed, however if this service cares about providing honest accounts of actual customers who live in this town, unlike the other reviews of this restaurant from out of towners, then this review might help.  I watched the owner shout obscenities at a customer who compalained about the food, while my kids were in the restaurant. We left immediately.  I do to support a place that cannot be civil towards customers, especially one that claims to be kid friendly.  The food is mediocre, but the service is way subpar."}
{"text":"We paid a visit to Zelma's last night hoping to get some good pizza and a relatively quick meal.  The pizza was good and service was acceptable other than it took an extremely long time to get our food.  We arrived around 7:10pm and there were around 5 other tables occupied in the place, so it wasn't busy.  It was around 7:50 before we got our pizza, about 15 minutes after we had finished up with our salad.  I don't know if they forgot to put the order in or accidentally sent it for carry out, but it should not have taken 40 minutes to cook a pizza.  We will probably give it another try as the pizza was very good, but sure hope the speed of service improves."}
{"text":"This place has some bomb thin crust pizza. I usually get take out but dinning in is pretty good. If you want dat real monicals pizza then come here."}
{"text":"This is a one-time visit place. Convenient for SW Champaign, so it's decent if you're short on time, but the place is just blah. Supposedly it is known for its burgers and pizza, but we got one of each and were not impressed. The burger was dry and overcooked, and the pizza crust was actually undercooked while the top looked burnt. Very young waitress... I'm sure there would have been issues had we ordered alcohol. The place is small, and we were the only people in there on a Friday at noon-ish. A couple TV's, huge booths, but nothing entertaining whatsoever. Basically, if you never eat here, you're not missing anything."}
{"text":"Definitely not the first place I'd go for pizza, even though that's what it's known for. The food is definitely good bar food though, nothing too crazy on the menu. The service has always been good though, pretty fast and always polite. The atmosphere inside is kind of weird though, so I usually just stick to takeout since I live down the street. Basically, I'd say convenience is the only reason this place gets an extra star from me."}
