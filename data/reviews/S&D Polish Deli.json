{"text":"I love the food at the S & D Polish Deli. The borscht and perogies are amazing! The place is very clean and smells great!"}
{"text":"Great little place just outside the busiest parts of the strip.  My wife and I stopped in for a quick snack and were pleasantly surprised by the authenticity, taste and speed of service.  We had all 4 of their pierogis and liked the mushroom and sauerkraut the best.  Their kielbasa is delicious - smokey, savory and even a little sweet.  The stuff cabbage was pretty tasty too.  If I were to go back I would probably get the pierogis and the kielbasa again.  Andrew Zimmer was on their in-house TV and he was eating the soup, so I would probably try that too! ;)  bottom line, we loved this place and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"A  REAL Polish deli and Polish Food place finally arrives!!  Family owned, by 1st generation immigrants =) 

Listen up... if you like sausage, european juices, homemade pierogis.. I just found my @ home store in Pittsburgh. They just opened last week (Dec. 15 or so) and are still building their store so its not all finished.. but when they are done they will have hot polish food for lunch and take out. Yes!!! 

The couple is from Poland that moved here a couple years ago. They import their sausage from Joe & Frank in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago for 16 years (after immigrating from Poland) and this Joe & Frank make their own varities that are really really good, probabbly the best in North Side Chicago. The prices are very reasonable! 

S&D Deli is on Penn between 22 and 23rd. They are still in construction but I encourage you all to visit and help this couple start up.I know I will! I was so extremely happy to find the food that Ive been missing since moving here a year ago.... They do have the best (next to Chicago) sausages from Joe & Frank and are friendly in explaining the varieites. Try the Kabanosy, they are my favourite. They also carry Tymbark juices like Cherry and  Apple Cherry etc.. they are really really good. The wife makes fresh pierogis too that i havent tried but its a great idea.

I also found fresh saurkraut there AND polish dried mushrooms (maslaki).. and all the chocolates I adore... Im sorry im just so elated with this..

Im so elated that Im thinking of offering to help them out promoting their shop at polish events around town.

Pittsburgh really needs this!! And i hope that they make it ."}
{"text":"We went down to the S&D Polish Deli on a Saturday afternoon.   The restaurant was crowed with half the people speaking English and the other half speaking Polish (always a good sign).   We ordered the Pork Stew over dumplings, and the dish was delicious.   They also serve alot of other authentic Polish dishes.  The prices were very reasonable and the dining area was clearn (but nothing fancy).   If you're in Pittsburgh and want good Polish food like grandma used to make, this is your place!"}
{"text":"We walked into this unassuming store just because of the food photos on the front door. It's an odd looking place, like it doesn't know what it wants to be...is it a restaurant, a deli, a bodega or a sports apparel store? Well, it turns out it's all of the above. Although the restaurant is odd looking - you order at a small window in the middle of the store - the food is 100% worth it! We got two kinds of pierogies - sauerkraut and mushroom/cheese - and a pig in a blanket (which is spicy meat wrapped in a cabbage leaf). Both were absolutely amazing - as if my Polish grandmother had made them herself. The grocery store also offered unique polish groceries - we got a spicy mustard that was very delicious. It lasted about a week in our house as we ended up putting it on everything. The best part of the experience was the great customer service from the authentically Polish girls that were working behind the counter. Overall, everything was excellent and we will definitely return!! PS: I'm not polish and I don't have a Polish grandmother:)"}
{"text":"Don't go to S&D expecting it to be a chain restaurant. It is a small plain little place with food to die for!  It isn't prepackaged.  My husband and I had lunch there. We both got perogies and halushki. I got stuffed cabbage and he got the kielbasa.  Delicious!  Made me think of Grandma's cooking. No, actually, this was better. We took home some perogies and wedding kielbasa. We really should have gotten more.  It will be worth stopping there with a cooler next time."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch and had wonderful  Haluszki and Perogies.  The service was quick and had a very local family feel. Great little place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the kielbasy platter with pierogy and haluski. Haluski had some dry or old discolored pasta mixed in with the fresh batch. So I was not thrilled about that. Kielbasy and pierogy were delicious. You order at window and pick up."}
{"text":"Awesome Periogies! Definitely the best pierogies in town. Another highlight is their Kabulzi (noodles). They are perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of flavor. Every bite is filled with flavor along with a nice smooth texture. It's so hard to describe the goodness! But definitely stop by and grab a few pierogies. It is a bit on the pricey side, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I went to this place in the spring of 2013 after not stopping inside for many years. They've remodeled-- I don't know when exactly that happened but it was a GREAT remodeling job, I just love the new reorganization of everything!  Nice, reasonably priced Polish lunch food, nice people, and much, much more. Love it."}
{"text":"Legit authentic food!  Visiting Pittsburgh for a hockey game and this was a great treat for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you are like me and have never tried a pierogi... Go here! From what I am told very authentic. I loved them! Try the pierogi platter so you can get a variety. Perfect for lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"It speaks volumes that months after my trip Stateside where I ate at more than 15 Michelin stars worth of restaurants, the two meals that linger are burritos in the Mission district in SF... and every damn thing I ate at S&D Deli. 

This review then is nothing about what you can buy at the deli to bring home but ALL about the food you can eat there. Don't expect balance or elegance, anything refined or with wine, it's hearty, nourishing, uplifting simple fare here. The pierogies were good, the kielbasa so tasty... those noodles. I can't even. Butter. Just butter. 

It's 7 months on that I'm finally getting down to finishing this review when I was there in April, but just reminiscing is making my mouth water."}
{"text":"Located in the Strip District, S&D Polish Deli is a hidden gem. The deli and grocery is unassuming and it feels like you're being served a family meal. The pierogis are delicious, with lots of butter and sour cream. The Haluszki Pittsburgh Style is the best I've had. As a vegetarian, I can also highly recommend the Meatless Platter. They don't serve coffee here, but if you want some I recommend stopping first at Allegheny Coffee and Tea Exchange right up the street. S&D is now a required stop when I visit the Strip District."}
{"text":"Authentic, fantastic polish food. While the prices are slightly steep for eastern European fare, the shear volume of food you get is astounding. I got the kielbasy  platter which included a sizable piece of kielbasa, 3 pierogi (which were fried/sauteed) and haluszki (apparently Pittsburgh style which I've never heard of - they seemed like normal haluszki to me). Additionally my wife and I split the bigos which was very good - not greasy at all. What makes the food so good is most of it is covered in butter - but you don't get polish food if you are watching your figure. Also, this place sells tons of polish meats and deli style items at the best prices I have seen in quite a while - they get all their stuff from a deli in Chicago. They even have pork in aspic (galareta) which is pretty rare and I've only seen for sale once in Chicago. My wife got the meatless platter which includes potato pancakes in place of the kielbasa. Overall, the food and portions were excellent. I plan of frequenting this place at least 2x/month."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Chicago with both lots of Polish influence from my grandparents. I left Chicago 8 years ago and have been seeking great polish foot ever since with no success, until now. 

Walking into S&D was just like the polish deli's my dad used to take me two and the hot, steamed pierogis, kielbasa, and stuffed cabbage brought back great memories of my grandmother's cooking.  Nothing could have been better on a cool, rainy morning. 

The staff was very friendly (and beautiful), the service was quick, and the selection was phenomenal. A true Pittsburgh treasure that I wish I had closer to home."}
{"text":"Gem of a place , go , eat. A lot. Pierogies excellent , good balance dough and filling. Potato pancake outstanding. Can eat there , maybe 1/2 dozen tables. Huge selection Polish Deli goods and pantry items. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Take my review with a grain of salt since I can't remember the last time I've had polish food, if ever, but god dang the pierogis and beet soup were flavorful. The pierogis were simple and hearty and the soup was complex and a treat for the taste buds. I also had the kielbasa and cabbage- both were okay but nothing spectacular. All in all, for its price point, you better be coming here instead of some chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic pierogies.  Wonderful texture and that very subtle pierogi taste.  They even have plum for the true pierogi aficionado.  The restaurant is in the back of a polish deli/grocer with lots of great Poland food.  I even picked up a t-shirt that said \"got pierogi?\"."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about here.. Sure they have a lot of different options to choose from but I'd prefer quality over quantity.. The potato pancakes were a pleather of nothing but grease and bland flavor.. The stuffed cabbage, well Let's just not even talk about that. I don't want to sound mean but this just isn't the real deal.. A lot of people have the misconception that if it's in the strip, it has to be good. I think you have to truly know what something is supposed to taste like before you can say it's great.. Just my opinion though. Not impressed or satisfied and probably won't return sorry"}
{"text":"Small store with a few tables. But the food is authentic and priced right. Great borscht, pierogies, and kielbasa. My mom is Slovak and she swears it's the best borscht she's ever had. In the Strip District which offers a variety of ethnic food and markets. We stop here for lunch ever visit to Pittsburgh and always get things to go when leaving the city. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing gem in the back of a true Polish grocery in the Strip district. 

Pierogis we're amazing, featuring three flavors and a rotating daily special. On this day the sweet cheese pierogi was amazingly faintly sweet and complimented the dough perfectly. Overall easily in the top tier of pierogis in town.

The nalesniki was pristinely prepared and also not too sweet. 

Order at the counter and prices still affordable, hard to say anything negative of this place."}
{"text":"Recently got stuck during the holiday's with no perogies, arthritis in my hands flared up, well trying most of the perogies around Philly and none of them reminded me of my own I thought I would try S&D, if I didn't like them I would blame Pittsburgh.  Well ordered them, got them on 12/23 (just in time) well they were great the dough was perfect like mine the filling was not the same as mine but excellent, fillings are subjective.  They were well worth the money spent and will order from them again.  Also tried the mushroom dumplings (youzka) for my borscht they were just like mine loved them.  A great place when you have high standards and can't make you own."}
{"text":"My family is polish, and this place has the best pierogis I've had. Get some other polish staples from the attached deli and grocery store!

Service is good as well, you order from a window and take it to a table. There is not much seating, so you might not find any during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Being a transplant Pittsburgher (and partially Polish) that now lives in Florida, I am so sad that I have just been introduced to this place on vacation. Oh my goodness, probably the best pierogies that I've ever had. Love the store itself, amazing selection of everything Polish. A must-stop when in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"OMG- if you want real polish food this is the best place to eat. The Polish platter is Great tons of food and worth every penny. I'm used to Polish food because my husband's family is Polish, believe me this place is authentic. Some of the best haluski I have ever had. Not only is the food fresh but they have a huge variety, Will definitely be back the next time we are in the strip District."}
{"text":"Delicious Polish food, just like Grandma used to make (if at slightly higher prices)! Extensive meat/grocery selection, as well as frozen pierogis, homemade sauerkraut, and cute Polish tchotchkes to take home. Whenever I'm craving comfort food in Pittsburgh, I'll know where to come."}
{"text":"Good sweet JEEBUS, how to begin. 

My husband and I are third and fourth generation polaks from the Chicagoland area, and we were on a trip through Pittsburgh, without much time to stop and sight see.  We were googling something simple like \"food to eat if you visit Pittsburgh\", and several Polish suggestions came up.  After a quick glance at the menu for S&D, we rushed right over for breakfast before hitting the road. 

And OH MY GOODNESS.  It was heavenly.  I learned that the way I normally make Haluski (without meat) is considered Pittsburgh style!  Who knew!  It was wonderful, and came with gobs of sour cream.

My husband ordered the kielbasy platter and he said it was wonderful, I tasted the mustard and it was spicy and YUM.  I ordered the Pittsburgh haluski, and we split two orders of their cheddar pierogi, and their potato and farmer's cheese pierogi.

I'll take a side note here to quickly say that I am a straight up pierogi snob.  My family has a very specific recipe that I've never seen anywhere else (I'm sure it's a strange post-immigration cluster fuck that has stuck around), and because of eating my family pierogis fresh out of the pan since I was a kid, I rarely enjoy pierogis any other way. We have family pierogi-fests every year and we all come together to do a giant cook.  I know pierogi. I tend to hate the potato-cheese combo, and I normally think it's bland and uninspired.  Simply put: I expect to be disappointed with pierogis, and I tend to think they all pretty much taste like Mrs. T's if they have potato in them. 

WELL.

I have been proven wrong, for the first time ever. 

S&D offers two options for their pierogi. 

Cooked = which I assume just means boiled.
Fried = obviously fried up in butter after being boiled. 

I was SUPER happy to see this option because in my house, we boil and then fry.  At least in restaurants in the Chicagoland area, this seems unusual.  I'm not sure why, we have a huge Polish community and I would have thought this was normal, but I guess not.  Anyways, it was wonderful to see the option, because normally when ordering pierogi they come out soggy and boiled like italian gnocci, with no golden crisp to them.  This got me excited.  I ordered four of the cheddar, and four of the farmer's cheese and potato.  I was a bit bummed out to see nothing similar to the family recipes, but oh well. 

The plate of pierogis that was handed over to me was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever beheld.  Four perfect little dumplings, practically floating in a warm, buttery pond, topped with green onions.  My goodness.  The butter wasn't just butter.  It had to have been cooked with garlic and onion, or something.  I have no clue but it was like heaven, actual heaven in my mouth.  The filling was creamy, and warm, and just UUUUUUUGGGGGHHH I WANT MORE.

My husband and I completely enjoyed our experience there, and it was above and beyond our expectations.  The food was like eating at home, like having your grandma cook for you.  It was the first time in my life that I've been able to eat and enjoy excellent Polish food without having to work for a while day and a half ahead of time, sweating and destroying my kitchen with family in order to reap the rewards.  It was a HUGE treat being able to just order, and enjoy.  And boy did I enjoy.  It was an experience.  And we got home to our Chicago suburb seven hours later feeling depressed and whiny that we're going to have to drive 8 hours the next time we want to go back."}
{"text":"Very good authentic polish food
In the strip market - fun to walk around

{"text":"For decades I've been hoping for a good eastern european restaurant in Pittsburgh.   Everyone always says that Pittsburghers won't pay for what they get at home.   Really?  There are masses of us that eat this kind of food at home in 2012?

Actually I think S&D partially fills this Pittsburgh void.   Their deli and take out food is really really good.        The deli is exceptional and lovingly operated.  The dessert section has sweets that might look different, but are fantastic!  (I love the cheese cakes and the merangue cakes!)

The take-out/eat in area looks very sparse and can be a wait.  The food is delicious, but beware....it is polish and not always polish american!  The pieogi are always home made and a pleasure to eat!

The feel of the whole place is family run and you can tell they are aspiring to be great!    

I stop in at S&D everytime I'm in the strip.   Now if they (or someone else) could fill the niche of Eastern European diner or proper sit-down restaurant....I'd be completely happy!"}
{"text":"This review is based on mail ordering their food. I'm originally from Chicago, now live down south, and you can't get any authentic polish food here (as far as I know).  Have ordered their kraut/mushroom pierogi, which are delicious; only wish they were bigger (about the size of a pizza roll).  Their kishka is wonderful and very authentic.  Tried stuffed cabbage, which was very good, but have made better myself.  Just recently ordered Bigos, or Hunter's stew.  Hasn't arrived yet, but looks and sounds delicious."}
{"text":"They have different varieties of their homemade pierogies in containers ready to go in their self serve refrigerator which makes it super easy to grab a delicious dinner for later!"}
{"text":"Took a dozen potato and cheddar pirogues home along with some kielbasa and some bread from Mancini's.   Awesome dinner!   

The pirogues just melt in your mouth, and are made to perfection every Time!  I usually eat there, but took these home this time, and I have to say, after frying them in some butter until golden brown with a slight thin crust makes these the best pirogues you will ever eat!  

I stop in here often, and no matter what I get, it is always great food.  

To be honest, I would have never tried the place if it weren't for an international exchange student that stayed with us a few years ago. He was from Russia and researched the place so we tried it since we hit the strip regularly.  I am sooooooo glad he brought us here, this place is authentic and you won't be disappointed if you eat here, or if you take it home and prepare it yourself.  The hulushka is out of this world too!   

PS: ain't nothing healthy in the entire place!  No wonder it's so good!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed coming here! The pierogi are the best! The potato pancakes are also fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Polish cuisine and this place was delicious! They had a ton of variety and I loved being able to shop around in their store after. I will definitely go back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"We were visiting my wife's family in Western Penn last June, and she was emphatic that we could not visit Pittsburgh without eating pierogis at least once.  Now, I'm down with anything doughy in general, and I'd been a fan of pierogis since discovering them in Ukrainian diners in New York.  I did some research on the Pittsburgh version, and on the first day we went to Penn Brewery and had an order of the pan fried ones there.  They were very good.  My wife was pleased.

The second day we happened to be wandering around The Strip and I mentioned that another Pierogi place I'd read about was close by.  That would be S&D, and we wandered down Penn until we found it.  

Now, I'm just going to tell you right off that they only lose a star because of ambiance.  I'll get to the food in a moment, but the place itself is something like a Polish convenience store.  Maybe they do most of their trade in wholesale, I don't know, but the place itself is sort of austere.  You order at a window and then wait at a table under really bright fluorescent lighting until they call your order.  I like atmosphere; that's not what S & D offers.  Staff are professional and that's about it.

All that to say, when we got our pierogis, they blew my mind.  One order of the potato-cheese and one order of the mushroom-kraut.  Just steamed.  Like I said, I've had many pierogi experiences, but what I realized after my first bite of an S & D one was that all the previous ones had been, basically, very pleasant sour cream/apple sauce delivery devices.  Just as these were, steamed with a splash of butter and kraut, they were incredible.  The best I've ever had, and my wife would say the same.

When I finally got around to writing this review, I noticed the other review below, the one claiming that S & D is importing their pierogis and not making them in house.  Look, I don't want to get in the middle of any Pittsburgh pierogi war - but that is difficult to reconcile with what I experienced.  Though not from these parts, I'm an avid eater and cook, and I feel reasonably confident that I would have noticed the evidence of that.  I encourage you to try it and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"Delicious pierogis! I've been waiting for these for awhile, since LA doesn't have great polish food. 

We went later in the day, so they didn't have as many fresh ready to make pierogis. But the flavors I had were:

Regular potato and onion
Cheddar and onion
Beef and sauerkraut
Cheese

They were boiled, not fried, and fell apart in your mouth. Delicious and tasteful, I ate 4 by myself in like 2 minutes. Only knock is there weren't available more flavors. Next time I'll come early!"}
{"text":"Cabbage roll was very good when we ate in the restaurant. We ordered a large catering order months later and it was disgusting. Not the same quality we had the first time. The whole thing tasted like a handful of black pepper. Low quality catering experience. Never again will I return"}
{"text":"In search of great eats here in Pittsburgh, we have heard many sing the praises of pierogies, and bookmarked this place as a must stop.  My husband and I shared a platter of pierogies that included potato & cheddar, potato & farmer cheese, and kraut and mushroom.  They were wonderful and reminded me of ravioli and/or dumplings.  My favorite was the potato and cheddar.  Gave me a warm fuzzy feeling and sent me into a carb bliss.  So if you are a fan of small warm stuffed pockets of pasta, you will enjoy these. Sweet ones are also on the menu, but we will save those for next time.  We also shared the Kiszka which is old fashioned blood sausage served fried with onions.  Ew, why would anyone eat that?! It sounds vile, and I never would have eaten it had I read the description carefully.  But you know what? It was really good! This time ignorance paid off!

No real service here, but the young ladies working behind the window were nice.  It's deli style--order at the window, pay, and they call your number when it's ready.  A small number of tables are available inside the store where you can also find many polish products, frozen foods (e.g. frozen pierogies) and souvenirs.  Overall, an extremely pleasing lunch!  We also had our eyes on those potato pancakes, so we may have to come back relatively soon."}
{"text":"I like this place even more since a recent visit showed me that their candy aisle is now enormous, and offers very good prices (better than those of another certain candy store close by!) on sweets from Poland as well as other places, including brands such as Milka and Kinder."}
{"text":"Delicious kielbasa and borscht. 
Pierogies were light and full of tasty and varied fillings -- our favorite was the spinach!
Friendly staff, spacious dining area, clean restroom."}
{"text":"i can't emphasize enough how AMAZING this place is. yeah, you know already about the pierogies and kielbasa and how delicious all of their beautiful, homemade, real-deal polish food is. but, if you're unfortunate enough to find yourself planning a wedding in pittsburgh, did you know they will cater your wedding? it feels like a magical secret that i want everyone to know about. They Will Cater Your Wedding!

my husband and i got married in highland park and were trying to cut cost as much as possible, while still providing everyone with a meal worth travelling for. (that's like the least you can ask from a wedding, right?) the folks at s&d were SO KIND and communicative, answering all of our questions, being flexible with times and dishes, and generally making us feel cared for in a totally unexpected way. at first the choice was made because the price was right, but they went out of their way to make delivery and set-up that day seamless and amazing. the food was hot, plentiful, and there right when we wanted it.

not to mention, again, how DELICIOUS everything was, especially for a crowd; his old-school polish family members were thrilled, my un-adventurous-eating family members, vegetarians, pittsburghers, out-of-towners, everybody was happy. 

seriously, give s&d your business if you need a caterer--they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"They still have amazing pierogies! Also, last time we were in we, got half a pound of the deli ham with garlic. If you are a garlic lover, you will adore this ham. It is perfect for sandwiches or also you could get it unsliced so you can use it in cooking different dishes. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I was just in Pittsburgh for a conference and randomly mentioned my love of Pierogis to my friend who lives there. So, of course when we had a hot minute for lunch she brought me here. I haven't had a real pierogi in ages and these certainly did not disappoint. SO good and swimming in a little pool of butter. They had several other items I wanted to eat (the vegetarian platter) but I had to restrain myself since I would be eating dinner again in 3 hours.... Anyhow, if you are in Pittsburgh & in the mood for a pierogi (if you're not in the mood you should be! get on these pierogis asap!) definitely swing by this place. Not too pricey, cash only if your bill is less than $10. 4 pierogis for $4. So.Good!"}
{"text":"Did the cooking class! Very fun and educational. Delicious food. Great workers. Stop in for lunch!!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor to the Strip and never knew about this place.  Thanks to Groupon we bought a deal for 4 to take a pierogi making class.  Multiple dates and times were offered and the Wednesday class from 6:30-8:30 worked best for our group. This got us in to the store and after seeing all of the delicious deli items (including a nut roll that looks amazing) I can't wait to go back for lunch. They are looking to expand and add other classes but I recommend the pierogi making one. It was well organized and the 2 instructors (Polish of course) were fantastic!  They gave us a simple to use recipe and careful instructions.  We watched as they prepared the filling and dough and then were able to roll out our own pierogis.  We then boiled them in a pot (my only complaint is that were ran out of time at the end of the class to cook them for the right time) and take a dozen home with us!  They were absolutely delicious and of course the butter/onion topping was a great touch."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  It's a restaurant and a grocery store. Their food is authentic Hungarian and delicious!  Recommend getting a plate with a variety of items.  We got the pierogis, noodles with cabbage, and kielbasa.  It was all delicious!  I love trying the variety of pierogis.  They also have everything fresh and frozen so bring a cooler to take stuff home!  They do need to invest in a few fans though for some air movement... Hotter than heck in there."}
{"text":"Went in to get one pound of kielbasa for a friend.  The girl behind the counter was waiting on someone else.  They were kind of shooting the shit while she was waiting on the customer.  There were two other workers there that I saw. After waiting about eight minutes, I kindly excused myself and asked if there was someone else that could wait on me as I had to get back to work. The girl turned around, copped a huge attitude, and adamantly waited on me.  I asked again if there was someone else (not her) that could wait on me as I didn't want to barge in on her current customer.  She was extremely rude and slammed everything that she had in her hands onto the counter. I would say her \"Merry Christmas\" was not sincere.  That will be my last trip into this place.  They obviously don't need my money.  BTW...they don't make their own pierogies or kolbassi."}
{"text":"Excellent Polish fare. Pierogi's are amazing and several different favors rotated daily. Potato and Cheddar cheese, Potato and Farmers Cheese and Kraut and Mushroom,....all great! Kielbasa was awesome. Potato pancakes were a bit too greasy for my taste.

Neat deli and grocery. Limited seating."}
{"text":"Went here recently when I was in Pittsburgh. I had done some research on pierogis in the Pittsburgh area and we were looking for a place to grab lunch in the Strip District, so this topped the list. The food was authentic Polish food and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered a number of items (pierogis, sausage, soups, stuffed cabbage) to share and no one left hungry. We also got some dessert from the deli counter. My only complaint was that I was hoping for potato pancakes and they only sell these at the deli to go (for frying at home) and not hot and ready to eat in the restaurant. This is a no frills place - very casual seating area that when they are busy gets crowded. However, was authentic and saved me a trip to Poland for food that was on par with much of what I had there!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and had to get some pierogi. It was fantastic!  I had the potato and cabbage/mushroom. The butter sauce and onions
was good. I also had some kielbasa and that was good too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, as I walked past here multiple times and never decided to stop even though I love Polish food. I had a kielbasi sandwich which I enjoyed. The meat was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The bread that it was on was clearly homemade and of the highest quality. The sauerkraut wasn't too bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. They put a lot of mustard on the sandwich, which was the only thing I did not like. I will get the pierogis at the end of the week, as that is easily my favorite Polish dish (just was craving some high quality kielbasi this afternoon!). Overall I'd definitely recommend. Highly authentic and it felt like the girls that worked there were fresh off the boat (who doesn't love that authentic feel?)"}
{"text":"We came on a busy saturday afternoon so we waited 45 minutes for our food to be cooked. However they warned us up front and we were cool with it. It ended up being well worth the wait. The stuffed cabbage is amazing as is the kielbasa. The pierogis are also great. My favorite was the potato and cheese. The platters are great to be able to sample a few different items. Authentic polish food with great prices and excellent customer service. They also have a great meat counter with fresh kielbasa and meats as well as a polish grocery area."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while shopping in the Strip district. I had their special of the day: cherry pierogi's. They were excellent!! Great texture and flavor! I never had a sweet one before, my Mom always made the cottage cheese ones, and I became a fan of the jalapeño cheddar store bought ones. I should really find out what they charge to ship to Arizona...oh, and great service too!"}
{"text":"(11/11/2014)  Was wandering through the Strip District and when we stumbled across S&D had to go in.  I knew I wanted pierogis from this trip to Pittsburgh.  S&D had packs of a dozen homemade, cooked, pre-dressed with butter and onion in the fridge case to go.  Perfect!  Got the Potato and Farmers Cheese.  They were moist, tender, plump.

The space includes a great deli with all the specialty Polish meats like smoked, blood, and fresh sausages, headcheese, cheeses.  Deli case and lunch counter have hot prepared comfort food for you to eat there or take home.  Back of the space is crammed with imported dry goods, condiments, candies and a body-sized freezer full of frozen pierogis.  Do not miss the fridge full of naturally fermented, homemade sauerkraut and pickles, wow!  They've got everything for you Polish needs right here."}
{"text":"Took my brother and mom here this afternoon for lunch.  We all left full and happy.  I bought, and the total price (3 big entrees and 2 bottled drinks) was $39.  

We all got platters and shared.  The pierogies were immaculate, cabbage and noodles were super buttery and delicious, and stuffed cabbage was completely bomb.  Kielbasa was good also, and I especially liked the mustard that it was served with."}
{"text":"I've never been to the deli but have just ordered some, what they claim to be \"bryndza\" (http://www.polishfoodandgifts.com/bryndza-sheep-milk-cheese/). However, once I've tried it, it wasn't bryndza at all, but what it tastes like to me feta mixed with cream cheese. I could have made that myself and it would most definitely cost me less $7 per .60lb.

The site should have either mention that it isn't authentic bryndza or call it something else, as it's very deceiving for someone who knows what bryndza should taste like. 

It's disappointing as I was looking forward oh having some true taste of home. Definitely won't be ordering more items. :("}
{"text":"Best food period in Pittsburgh, visiting this week I've had the traditional sandwiches, pizza, wings etc. But all of them pale in comparison. Great huluski, pierogies, kielbasa served in a great atmosphere. Very friendly staff, the cook was very nice."}
{"text":"[Warning: Visitor from St. Pete, FL]
GO STRAIGHT TO THE DELI AND EAT THERE
This casual little market surprised us with some very tasty PIEROGIES. I have no hint of Polish in me so I skipped the counters in the front and merely wondered the market in the back while they prepared our food. If anything, my unfamiliarity with Polish products was entertaining.

FILLING WITH PIEROGIES  
These little guys were presented very simply yet were nicely warm and tasted almost comforting. The menu board lists many other fillings for the Pierogies, but during this visit there was only Potato and Cheese or a Sweet Cheese and Spinach. Nicely priced as well. There are also a few tables inside for dining."}
{"text":"S&D Polish Deli
A top-rated Pittsburgh tasty-eats gem, we headed here after seeing the long line outside Primanti Bros that is renowned for its sandwiches.
Parking was tricky as street parking and parking lots are available but at a cost.
The place is a carry out, with a limited seating area and a well-stocked Polish market. They were out of the mushroom soup so we had the red and white Borsch. We also had the Kielbasa Platter that comes with 3 pierogi (1 cheese & 2 mushroom w/ kraut) a generous plate of Haluski (egg noodles and cabbage) and a single thick, Kielbasa.
What a real treat this place turned out to be. It was nothing less than superlative-quality, passed-down-from-generations-recipes of home-made goodness!!!
The red borsch was clear broth that was a bit sweet but a great spicy taste to counter the sweet flavor, plus I love beets. The white borsch looked like sausage gravy for biscuits and it was heartier than the red, with a good amount of Kielbasa slices.
The egg noodles were buttery, not over-cooked and very addictive that was complimented perfectly by the cabbage and a well-prepared, crispy-on-the-outside-but-not-over-cooked, Kielbasa.
I might have been smiling the whole time eating that food. The service was excellent because of their friendliness, willingness to help and abundant patience. Pittsburgh as a whole was sooooo very friendly and patient!!!!!
Cannot wait to come back to Pittsburg and come back to S&D; we might eat there 2x next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have traveled to Poland and even if I see they Americanized some of the food selections for the locals. Like the haluski not having square noodles and less weird stuff in a the can goods section they have all the norms/basics of a nice Polish grocery store/deli. They have a small sit down restaurant and even a ready made food section with everything you need for lunch/dinner. In the back they have frozen food and goods and cheeses in the front and back.

My personal favorite is the hunters kielbasa with the farmers cheese perogies and sauerkraut. The sauerkraut is some of the best I have had and is a must try. Also a good price.

I also really like that it's all ready made and I can just take some home warm it up and have a ready to eat dinner in no time."}
{"text":"Decent options for vegetarian food, very heavy and buttery (as Polish food may be served). We had the meatless platter, daily special spinach and cheese pierogies (best one), and the cheese crepe type thing. The potato pancakes were drenched in oil, hard to eat more than a few bites."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Sunday afternoon while heading over to Lucy's Bahn Mi cart (which I LOVE, btw). I must have passed S&D's a gazillion times before but never had the urge to venture in. 

I was told by a friend that the best pierogies are sold at churches. While that may remain true for some folks, I found that S&D's are pretty damn good!! My mouth is literally watering right now thinking of their food.

We frequent the store every Sunday after church to get our \"snacks\" and this generally means we split the Polish platter for $11 which includes haluszki, 1 stuffed cabbage, and 3 different pierogi. This can't be good for us! (I kid!)

The haluszki is very soft pasta but not mushy seasoned with butter, pepper, onions. I don't know what it is about it that makes it so wonderfully delicious? But it is and it's totally worth trying!

The stuffed cabbage is also a favorite of mine. The cabbage is tender enough to cut through with a fork. I don't know what the meat is but it's covered in a tomato sauce. Also very delicious.

Lastly the pierogi in the Pierogi Platter comes with 3 pieces. Each with different filling: potatoes and cheese, a white cheese, and meat with sauerkraut. The dough is always cooked perfectly not hard edges. Flavored with butter and finely minced onions. How can something so simply made taste so good!! 

I love this place and I love that each Sunday we have our little tradition at S & D. 

It's mainly a Polish market. They also have specials for the day located near the cashiers station."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some authentic Polish cuisine and were very pleased with the delicious pierogi's. As it is situated in a deli, it does lack for ambience but definitely gives you that authentic vibe. I would definitely come back to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"My in-laws were visiting for dinner from out of town and I wanted to treat them to pierogi since I'm Polish and pierogi are associated with Pittsburgh! I was so excited to stop by S&D to take some pierogi home to prepre later. 


You can order all sorts of prepared pierogi from the window inside S&D but I opted to get some pierogi to make later from the refrigerator. These pierogi are all made fresh daily in-house. They had regular cheese/potato flavors but also fun and unique flavors like plum! I opted for a few cheddar and a few farmers cheese. The preparation instructions are on their website if you don't know how to cook them!

The girl behind the counter helped me pick out the kinds and quantity of kielbasa I should get. She took her time explaining all the different kinds since I didn't know what I was looking for (never seen so much kielbasa in my life!) 

In the end my in-laws were obsessed with the meal and not one bite was leftover. Thank you S&D!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and trying out polish food. I absolutely loved it. We ordered mushroom soup which was yummy,a pierogi platter and a kielbasy  platter. The beet soup was extremely  tasty too."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! I would absolutely not recommend these products be shipped at all. Because I live in Florida, I purchased a cooler with dry ice to ensure my shipment was received in good order. What I received was a box lined with Styrofoam which was basically a make shift 'almost' cooler. My food was completely thawed and smelled awful. I purchase food items from many companies and never saw anything packaged like this before. No wonder it wasn't cold :-(

Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Nom nom. I haven't been to a really good Polish deli in a very long time- we are short on them in Ohio. However, on a recent trip to Pittsburgh- I found this place on the recommendation of fellow yelpers. I destroyed half of a pierogi platter (6 pierogis including cheddar and potato, farmers cheese and potato and kraut/mushroom). I was a fan. Add in the spunky little woman behind the counter, the beautiful day outside, the extremely reasonable price and this great little neighborhood (strip district)... and you are lucky I don't intend on becoming a permanent resident."}
{"text":"If you're craving a filling, hearty Polish meal like your babcia used to make, you need to get yourself down to the Strip District and give S&D Polish Deli a try. Equal parts lunch counter, grocery store, and gift shop, S&D will remind you of a Polish heritage you may not even know you had. 

The lunch counter has a wide range of Polish specials, ranging from Pittsburgh's favorite pierogi in a variety of flavors, to soups and stews such as bigos. The Polish platter is my favorite when I want a big lunch. It's a full plate loaded with go??bki (stuffed cabbage), pierogi, and a heaping helping of haluszki. All of it tastes authentic and made with care. You'll get served quickly, but a meal like this is best eaten slow, both to enjoy the flavor and to make sure you don't burst.

The grocery portion of the store features most of the items at the lunch counter to go, as well as a selection of fresh and smoked sausages, Polish cheeses, homemade sauerkraut, and more. A wide variety of packaged foods and snacks imported from Poland are available as well. In addition, there are all sorts of clothes, hats, mugs, and flags for sale so you and all your friends can show off your Polish pride. Even when not eating here, it's fun to browse the store, and I just know I'll give in and buy a hat one of these days.

S&D Polish Deli is the spot for Polish food, whether you want to make it yourself or have it done for you. Raise a glass and say, \"Na zdrowie!\" to S&D!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a great place to visit in the Strip District and has amazing perogies. The atmosphere is so inviting and is a must stop in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I think it's a little overpriced, especially in an area that has so many other food choices. But it's clear they make the food with care. Most recently I tried their mushroom pierogies, which were excellent.   
I've only eaten the deli food on location.  I never bought or tried any of their frozen foods."}
{"text":"Nice little deli with a few tables to sit down and grab a bit to eat off their menu. I got the Kielbasa sandwich and it was very good. I also had some perogies that were pretty tasty. All in all it's a good place to come in and grab a bite for lunch or shop for some specialty Polish hams. Not a dinner place. Very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Great Polish Deli right in the Strip. Always get the fresh sauerkraut and homemade pickles they keep behind the counter. Great kielbasa and smoked meats. AJW loves the European candy aisle. All sorts of great goods for people (like me) who love Eastern European food. Some of the prepared food is flat out great. The braised pork knuckle is out of this world and not a cut you find everyday. People running it are super knowledgeable, and nice. They never fail to give AJW a piece of candy and make her smile. It's places like this that make you fall in love with Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have to start this with the fact that I'm not partial to Eastern European food.  It sits a bit heavy and greasy to my liking.  So my review may be slightly biased.  Still, when in Rome.....  I tried some of the pierogis.  They were all prepared as well as can be.  Moist, rich filling.  They had fresh fillings and the dough was still moist.  As good as they could possibly be.  They had a sweet and savory quality.  I would rank it as good as any polish food as I've had."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.   Stumbled into this cafe style with market place and impressed.   Food was buttery yet very tasty.   Things I did not love -service can be slow around lunchtime...and mushroom soup was --meh.  
Will be picking up some of these wonders for next potluck."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying different types of foods from different places and the S&D Polish Deli really provides that.  This is a cute little place on the strip with women who actually speak the language. The setup is a bit odd, the tables unstable and honestly they all needed a good wipe down. I asked for and did my table myself. Oh well, they weren't perfect.

On to the food! I went with the Polish Platter which consisted of Halupki, perogies, a mammoth pig in the blanket and a drink. I did get a extra pig because I have portion issues. Plus my W refuses to make them because we aren't polish. What kind of reason is that?! Anyway, the food was well seasoned and hot on the plate. Also, the lunch was $11 which isn't too bad for the strip. Hope you enjoy my picture. :)"}
{"text":"Recently I spent several days in Pittsburgh. I and had the opportunity to explore the Strip District and found this gem of a deli. 

I had the Kielbasa Platter. It came with pierogis, the Polish haluszki and kielbasa. It was awesome and way more than I should have eaten. 

This is not real fancy but in my mind....just perfect.  The staff was great and very helpful.  It was served up in just s few minutes. If you liked anything, as it is a deli, you could take it home with you.  Unfortunately i could not do that on this trip. 

However, I will be back!

I highly recommend this to all."}
{"text":"This place served me one of the two best meals I had in Pittsburgh where I recently spent a week.  (The other best meal was had a Max's Alleghany Tavern.)  S&D is a little deli/grocery store in the District, so it's an interesting place to walk.  Lots of shops and street sellers to browse.

We ordered periogi, haluski and stuffed cabbage.  It was just to die for - rich and flavorful.  I do not think you could have a better Polish lunch than we had.  I would have it again in a heartbeat and I'll be coming back when I return to Pittsburgh.

There are interesting Polish products to buy at this store, too."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were the only patrons ordering. The lady was friendly and answered our questions. 
 I got the Smoked Kielbasy sandwich w/onions and a side of potato pancakes. It was a lot of food. The sandwhich was amazing and you could tell it wasnt overly processed. The potato pancakes on the other hand were too greasy for my tastes, but after soaking the grease up with a napkin, the pancakes were also pretty good."}
{"text":"Kind and hilarious people making yummy food and selling quirky cultured things, this is my kinda place!

Yummy food options and a good cultural venture into PA demographic history. Our pierogies were delight full and the sauerkraut was really fresh. Unfortunately we were not able to try haluski because their kitchen was down due to a broken air conditioner.

Give em a try, also walk around the area if you are there visiting!"}
{"text":"Great places for Polish cuisine ... their pierogies not only are reasonably priced but are pretty darn delicious. They also have great Polish carb dishes if you are interested too. You can also buy frozen if you are looking to make some for later."}
{"text":"Authentic Polish food at a reasonable price. You order at the window and wait until they call your number.

My favorite Pierogies are still Pierogies Plus, but these come a close second.

There's a deli where you can order meats and cheeses. They also have Polish shirts and mugs, also a candy aisle.

The service is quick and cheerful. 

They also sell nut rolls at the front counter."}
{"text":"Big, comfortable Polish deli counter, place to order quick Polish foods, and a small grocery area with all sorts of interesting goods. There's mustard, dried soup packets, pickled beets, frozen perogies, refrigerated herring filets, candies, cookies - all Polish brands.

The Polish platter was pretty good. I liked the rather stiff cabbage around the stuffed cabbage roll. The perogies were all good, especially the potato and cheese one. The haluzski was ok, it was cooked in a sauce of butter, cabbage, and onions.

They also sell Polish cheese.

Good place to try Polish food - though much of it seems like hearty winter food to me. It all feels a bit salty after eating."}
{"text":"Authentic! Super nice staff! Very helpful the second you walk in the door! They have 3 types of fresh perogies and frozen ones as well. Lots of yummy looking desserts too."}
{"text":"Such a simple little Polish deli but so good. We stumbled upon this place while exploring the Strip District and are thankful we did.

I ordered the six pierogies, as an assortment, so we could try the various fillings. What arrived were six of the same (which was fine - they were absolutely delightful!) -- kraut and mushroom, with a cup of creamy thick sour cream. The melted butter and extra kraut on top made for a perfect dish. We also had the cabbage roll which was full of flavor.

Prices are on point and the food felt authentic. There's not much in terms of ambiance but we enjoyed our experience for a light lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best polish food!. You can't go wrong no matter what you get. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My girlfriend was wanting perogis ever since I made her Mrs. Ts. This place has the best in the city. The closest ever to my grandmothers!!!  Can't wait to go back next time!!"}
{"text":"The pierogie fix gets handled here. Friggin delicious. Had the sampler with 3 different kinds and it's been a while but I think our favorite was one with spinach in it. I've never tried red borscht or beets really...but this. This has changed me. Life before as I knew it is over and I am a borscht lover. So sweet and savory and soul-warming. Try it. Also had kielbasa on a bun...the meat and mustard was great but the bun I could've done without. Useless breads in the way of my meat enjoyment. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Pierogies are prepackaged, not made there. Famous ladies in McKees Rocks is the 'made on site' place to go for the real deal! Not here"}
{"text":"While searching for a place to find pierogis around strip district, yelp led me to this place.  Looking at the many european goodies around the store, I was excited to try the food, located in the rear of the store. I can't say that I'm a pierogi connoisseur, but given the huge variety of salty and sweet kinds they had, I tried quite a few of them and liked them all! i haven't tried or seen sweet pierogies anywhere else, so seeing the strawberry one that i ordered, topped with sour cream, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it concluded my meal.

besides the slightly slow wait (which is understandable due to the small staff), i'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The deli has a variety of meats (head cheese, kielbasa) and cheeses along with stuffed cabbage, potato & apple pancakes and pasztecik.
Towards the back, you can order dine in food - pirogies, kilebasa, etc and mix and match combo plates. Nothing is above $11. Love these pirogies. I sampled the cheddar and potato, kraut and mushroom and farmers cheese. Fried is $1 more. I always prefer mine boiled. 
Yum!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the cabbage rolls and pierogies here . Very friendly environment.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We just had the most wonderful experience. We are visiting from out of town, and Joseph was absolutely wonderful. We showed up just outside of the hours and he still opened the doors and gave us an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"What I love most about the strip district is the wide range of ethnic foods and markets it serves. Just to name a few you have the Italian markets, Asian markets, Mexican markets and then you have S&D Polish Deli! This place is one of my favorites! My mom is a vendor in the strip district and when I helped her a few years back I would always grab lunch here. 

What is there not to love, they have fresh polish meats, polish cheeses, pastries (those angel wings...to die for), hot foods (that you can order to go or dine in) and it's a mini market for polish groceries. Did I mention they sell polish gear too? Hats, hoodies and T-shirts can all be found inside!  They also sell the homemade sauerkraut by the quart, it's delish!! A few other things I have tried are the pierogi's, kielbasa, and my favorite haluszki (Pittsburgh style). All things Polish can be found in this little gem of a store."}
{"text":"The pierogi is the best in town. The creeper sticks are to die for. The halukzki is the best I've ever had, especially when Jamie makes it! Oh, and there's there really cute polish girl with grey hair. I go there just for her ;)"}
{"text":"Working just up the street from S&D Polish Deli, I cannot believe it took me so long to get here.  The Deli is a combination of a store and a lunch window, which is perfect.  While you are ordering lunch and waiting, you can pick up any meats or Polish delicacies you could want for dinner!  They also have frozen pierogies that you can take home and heat up for dinner!

I came in a week or so ago, and I ordered the spinach and cheese pierogies, which was the daily special.  For only $4, I got 4 pockets of joy.  The butter sauce was delicious.  The inside was 98% spinach and 2% cheese so I would only order these as a spinach lover.  The filling was fantastic, and there was a plethora of it.  I really want to try the farmer's cheese and potato cheddar ones now too.

The employees are very friendly, and I look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Food: 4
Value: 2.5

I got the keilbasy sanwhich. The meat itself was great, bread was fresh, honey mustard was fair, however the onions were a bit strange. I thought it was very pricey though at $6 for basically a keilbasy hot dog. Everything else on the menu looked quite expensive as well. I may have to stop by again and try the peirogis to get the full experience"}
{"text":"If you like cold and sub-par pierogies, go here."}
{"text":"Sweet Baby Jesus...I just died and landed in Polish Heaven!! Have you ever eaten something so good that you heard the angels sing??! Yep.

I don't even know where to start. 
Pierogi. Homemade.
Definitely get the potato and cheese and the sauerkraut and mushroom.
You'll feel like you're eating in your Bubba's kitchen!!
You can order everything they sell and eat there at the little cafe in the deli. It's just a few basic kitchen tables in the rear of the store, but a MUST DO.
We would have loved to have tried the cabbage rolls and the potato pancakes, but we already had lunch reservations elsewhere and couldn't eat too much.

We of course took home additional pierogis.
They have them fresh in the refrigerator or frozen in the back of the store.
We also took home the Polish Regular kielbasa and the Juniper kielbasa. Both simply wonderful. Both kielbasas were smoked to perfection with nice snappy skin.
And we couldn't pass up taking home a poppy seed roll!!

And the best part...everything we bought cost just under $50.
I'm already planning to visit again and ordering from the Deli online!!"}
{"text":"We tried their hot food for to-go. The food was great and everyone in the store was friendly and helpful. My favorite was the boiled potato pierogi and the haluszki pasta. Both were delicious.
They also have a nice meat/cheese selection and groceries in the back."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of traditional cuisine like babcia used to make, S&D is your place. The platter options are diverse, and gives customers a great chance to sample dishes both new and familiar. The nonchalant serving window, basic stainless steel cutlery, and surrounding convenience store gives the deli a really homey feel when eating in. With no frills, and plenty of oil laden options, S&D breeds authentic Polish Hill delights, right in the Strip."}
{"text":"They have a nice variety of deli meats, cheeses and kielbasa. They've also got a lot of different imported polish staples. I came specifically for the headcheese and pickled herring. I also decided to get some hot food take out. I got the platter that had pierogies, haluski, and kielbasa. The cheddar and potato pierogies were amazing. The haluski was decent. The kielbasa was disappointing though. It was very dry and over-cooked. I'd go back for the pierogies and I'd like to try some of the different flavors that they had frozen. Staff was super nice."}
{"text":"My sister in law treated 4 of us to the Pierogi making class at S&D Polish Deli.  Dorota and Slawomir are the owners of the Deli and Dorota was our pierogi instructor for the evening.  She was fun, informative, and had a great sense of humor.   We got hands on experience kneading and rolling out the dough, forming and filling the dumplings, and frying them.  They were delicious!  We enjoyed a couple of them at the deli and packed up the rest to take home.

This class was a ton of fun, especially with a group of us, or even your significant other.  I recommend attending a class with Dorota as your instructor - she and Slawomir are awesome.   I look forward to the next series of classes offered.  This was well worth the time and money."}
{"text":"After years of being a customer, this business is still one of my favorites. This time I purchased potato cheese pierogies, which were regularly $11 for one dozen but were on sale for $7.70 because of the expiration date; a dozen frozen pierogies for $9; borscht for $8.50 per quart; haluszki for $8 per quart; and a dozen of kolaczki apricot cookies for $10 each. The fresh borscht was *just broth* (!), although the frozen borscht contained dumplings. Based on the ingredients, I definitely overpaid for the fresh borscht and haluszki. I am willing to continue to buy the pierogies and kolaczki because they make them better than I do."}
{"text":"I stopped by this past weekend for lunch by myself.  Having never tried Polish food except for the ubiquitous pierogies, I was keen to sample this unfamiliar cuisine.  Because I can be quite picky about the type and form of meat that I eat, I decided to play it safe and order the meatless platter ($11). It came with the following items: a generous helping of haluski, two potato pancakes, and three pierogies (farmer's cheese, potato/cheddar, mushrom/sauerkraut), as well as sides of applesauce and sour cream for the potato pancakes and pierogies, respectively (see photo).

All of the dishes comprising the platter were cooked perfectly, and were absolutely delicious.  The haluski was al dente, and had a nice butter-herb sauce; the potato pancakes were crispy on the outside with a soft, pliable interior; and the pierogies were flavorful and stuffed with filling.  All of them were good, but my favorite was the potato/cheddar, which had a deliciously warm and savory filling that was well complemented by the cool, creamy sour cream.  These were definitely not your grocery store variety Mrs. T's pierogies, which are served at many restaurants around town--these are the real deal!

As I was waiting for my lunch to be served, I browsed the store and was intrigued by the wide variety of Polish foodstuffs.  My attention was captured in particular by the pierogies in the freezer (the same ones served on my platter, I presume), as well as the interesting soups in the refrigerator in the back (tripe soup, anyone?).  If you're looking for hard-to-find Polish goods, this is probably one of your best bets around town to find them.  If, on the other hand, Polish cuisine is as foreign to you as it is to me, stop by for a delicious, filling lunch that will provide a great introduction to it!"}
{"text":"I never understood the whole pierogi obsession in Pittsburgh. Don't get me wrong, they're fine, but I never found them exciting. S&D's are kind of exciting! I had never had soft, doughy pierogi like this! You could actually taste the melted cheese inside the cheddar ones--this is nothing like Mrs. T's frozen lumps of starch.

While the shop closes at 4:30, the kitchen closes at 3:30, and you probably want to get here before 3. We arrived at 3:20, not knowing the kitchen closed early, and the Polish woman working the kitchen was VERY reluctant to cook any food for us. We felt bad so we only ordered off the quick menu (there's I think 4 different types you can get right away, but if you want to wait longer they have tons of other options, including fruit-filled!).

The grocery section had a large variety of Polish goods. As an Italian, I feel more at home surrounded by pasta and mozzarella cheese, but I imagine this place would be a wonderful refuge for those with Polish roots. Watch what you're buying though, many of the canned goods were well past their expiration dates."}
{"text":"A trip to this deli/store is a trip down memory lane for me.  I'm 100% Polish and grew up with grandparents making pierogi and other Polish treats.  

There are essentially two portions to this shop.  The deli that serves the meals and the convenience store type back end of the shop.  The food they serve is home made and authentic.  The platters may seem pricey at $11 each, but well worth it for the amount of food that you get.  

The store portion has a great selection of Polish related trinkets and apparel.  Think butter lamb molds, Polish flags, decorated easter eggs and a plethora of mugs, keychains, etc.  The back portion of the store has the treats they serve in the deli in frozen form along with a variety of Polish grocery items ranging from candy to tea and everything in between.

My favorite part of S&D is that they have started doing cooking classes.  The first of the series was a pierogi making class.  It was well organizes and so much fun!  I purchased our class through Groupon but would have paid the full price with how much fun we had.  The instructor Marta and her assistant were funny and helpful.  I felt like I had known them my whole life by the time we were leaving the store.  The class started with Marta showing us how the dough is made (with one person from the class assisting).  Then she walks you through how one filling is made (potato and farmer's cheese with onion).  Because of the class size and time, these steps are done for the group as a whole rather than individually.  Once those initial steps are done, each participant is given their dough and filling and after brief instruction on the proper way to close the pierogi, you are let loose.  The nice thing is that the instructors are there for you to go over whether your dough is rolled thin enough, if you have the right amount of stuffing, etc.

After you finish your pierogis, you take them over to the pots and boil them.  You can eat them in the store that evening or take them home.  Most people gobbled theirs up because they were so tasty.  

I really look forward to seeing what class they offer next and will likely sign up shortly after it is announced."}
{"text":"First time trying Polish food for me was at this place, and I'm sure I made a good choice. The deli/store/sit-in atmosphere was very chill, and one can browse around each of the areas freely. We decided to first eat lunch, and it was quite difficult to decide among all these inexpensive items. Ended up trying a kielbasa platter, the stuffed cabbage, and the special beef tripe soup. 

Everything was delicious--my favorite was actually the soup, which I have no idea how often they rotate it in. Amazingly warm and flavorful, and very much full of meat. I was also a fan of the kielbasa, which was perfectly smoked, as well as the delicious pierogi (cheese and spinach that day). The stuffed cabbage was also an interesting choice, seeing as how they layer the meat inside with cabbage and then put it the tomato sauce. Finally, the cashiers were extremely nice, and we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for the food.

After eating, we browsed the store section, which contained a whole bunch of Polish snacks, candies, juices, and pastries. It turns out they sell a lot of their items refrigerated in the back, including different flavors of pierogi, soups, and cabbage. We only ended up buying a fruit nectar and jarred herrings, but I definitely look forward to next time to trying more new things."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, I have to say. The pierogis(4 for $4) are stunningly good, the dough is so soft that it melts like butter in your mouth(Or maybe that's just all of the butter, they give plenty!), and the insides are flavorful. These aren't your standard freezer pierogis, full of bland potato mush - whoever is making these has perfected their craft, and cares about every one.

I've also tried a few other items, like the borscht... It wasn't my favorite, pretty lightly flavored, but that's OK, it wasn't bad, just not as hearty as I would like. The store is filled with funny polish novelty convenience store items, including chocolate bars and other knick-knacks. The back seating area takes up about half of the store.

I do have one complaint about this place, and that's the wait. They have a poster that says you can get any pierogi filling with a 10 minute wait - or cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, or kraut+mushroom immediately, which to me implies that your wait when there is nobody else in the place would be less than 10 minutes. Every time I'm in here, though, I'm waiting well over 10 minutes to get an order, so they should really try and cut down on the wait time.

Also, like every other place in the strip, S&D is plagued by not being open long enough, so my only chance to enjoy is to try and make a bus trip on my lunch break or fight parking on the weekends - neither appealing, but I have taken both options to sink my teeth into these delicious pierogis"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... where to even start...

I bookmarked this place because my boyfie's dad is Hungarian and doesn't get to eat it that type of food very often. We came in on a Sunday at 1pm and the place was empty when we arrived, but TOTALLY packed when we left. 

I've only had pierogis once in my life and I absolutely LOVED them. They were the Costco frozen ones too, haha. I didn't know the homemade kinds could taste THAT much better than the frozen ones, but holy moly. We ordered 2 mixed platters that came with pierogis, stuffed cabbage, and haluski along with 1 platter of mixed pierogis. We ordered both boiled and fried because we didn't know any better, but the boiled ones were 100x better than the fried ones. We thought we ordered TOO much food, but ended up eating almost all of it. Left so stuffed I couldn't function the rest of the day. It was me and my boyfie's first time having haluski and we both loved it.

The best part of the meal was hearing my boyfie's dad say that he felt like he was back at Grandma's house eating a home cooked meal :').

We ended up finding some frozen pierogis in the freezer in the back and took 3 packs home :) Can't wait to eat them!!"}
{"text":"I love the S&D Polish Deli! They have heaps of variety not only at the deli counter but also at the convenience store. Lots of Polish delicacies such as pickles, sweets, sausages, sauerkraut etc. I purchased so many different things here and was never really disappointed. I am not a huge fan of their stuffed cabbage, but that's my taste buds and has nothing to do with freshness or quality, cause this is consistently good. 

Another part that I really loved was their pierogi making class! i came here with a couple of friends on a Thursday night. The class itself was a lot of fun and we all were made feeling welcome all the way through. The family that owns this shop is just really genuine and friendly. The class itself took about 2 hours after which we could enjoy our potato and onion pierogi topped with butter and what else - more onions! :) The family was friendly and bubbly and didn't shy away giving a lot of tips and tricks to cook things to perfection. I felt like being part of the family which made this class so enjoyable. 

The prices are average in this shop as well and if you order from the deli you'll be surprised by the portions they hand out. They definitely found a new regular customer in me!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to this place and said they made the best Piegori!!! It's one of the traditional Polish food. I never try it before. We got the \"Piegori Platter\" it includes 4 beef w. Cabbage, 4 potatoes, and 4 farmer cheese Piegori. Turn out to be that out of the 3 flavors the farmer cheese was my favorite. Overall great place for tourist to go and try there food. Also it's a deli store so they have many other small polish souvenirs to buy. I bought many a lot of polish chocolate home with me! :)"}
{"text":"This small Polish deli is unique. If you are in the Strip and want pierogis and haluski then this is the place to visit. You can also grab some groceries as well if you want kielbasa or other Polish foods. If you are shopping in the Strip, I recommend stopping by and at least check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, and--in my opinion--puts so many things I love about Pittsburgh into one tiny location. The ethnic pride. The chaos. The friendliness. The great food.

I'm half Polish, though I didn't really grow up eating too much Polish food (or, at least, too much authentic Polish food). My wife and I stopped at a killer, real-deal Polish restaurant in Montreal a few years ago, though, and that started my quest for amazing Polish food. Which quickly led us to S&D in the Strip. 

It's a pretty narrow place, and it always seems packed (even on weekdays). The space is pretty evenly divided between retail, deli, and a small dining space. You can order food and eat it, and boy is it good. I've tried about four different dishes there, all incredible. (Personal recommendation: the pork stew on dumplings is tops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!) This is all authentic stuff, folks, and, the folks in the tiny kitchen whip it up quickly. There's limited space to eat, though, and even then the tables are wobbly and kind of gross. This might be the only qualm I have with the place, and it's really a minor one.

There're a lot of Polish and Eastern European household goods jammed into the back of the shop, too--everything from teas to pottery to chocolate to frozen pierogi. Lots of kitschy \"Kiss Me, I'm Polish\"-style shirts adorn the walls, of course, but they also have some lovely glassware and the like. Some of the imported goods are wonderful, too. I picked up a box of Herbapol mint tea once on a whim and now I'll never touch drink anything else.

The good folks there--all family, I think--are super friendly, switch back and forth between English and Polish for effect. There's always a huge link snaking past the deli meat and cheese display, and customers are always so good-natured. I love it, and I love this place. Hope you will too!"}
{"text":"The most authentic polish food I have ever had.. The good was to die for and I would suggest to anyone and everyone who is interested in the infamous Pittsburgh Periogies to come here, YALL WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Yeah, Awesome.

I always expect nothing but excellence in the Strip District when it comes to specialty cuisines and S&D Polish Deli is no exception.  I came in moderately hungry (had a lobster roll from Wholey's and a chicken skewer from Sam Bok) and by the time I saw the massive collection of sausages, my mind raced and effectively made a decision for me to be hungry again).  I was really at a loss for what to pick and the exceptionally friendly people behind the counter allowed me to sample over a dozen different types until I finally settled on the cured beef sausage which was just delicious.  Other items to try is the awesome array of pierogies  and potato pancakes - just astounding.  S&D is the kind of place you want to go to after you have just watched a documentary of how sausages are made in old Europe - it completely satisfies your hankering and leaves you hungry for more.  I can't wait to make another trip here."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pierogi fan but I couldn't shake off my craving for something doughy and cheesy so based on the reviews I decided to head over to S&D Polish Deli to try their pierogies.  I got 2 cheddar cheese/potato and 2 sauerkraut and mushroom.  Between the two I prefeerd the cheese/potato but I could see how depending on your mood and craving you might want to check out the sauerkraut and mushroom.

All of the pierogies tasted fresh and had a bit of that salty fried in butter taste, but it wasn't overpowering.  It was actually just right.  I wasn't a fan of the chives/parsley they put on top, but maybe that's something I'll need to remember for when I get my next pierogi craving."}
{"text":"Lots of polish foods and groceries. Didn't eat here but everything we were looking for we found! Big variety of kelbisa!"}
{"text":"Filling but bland.

We had the Polish Platter and the Kielbasy Platter for lunch.

The Haluszki and the Stuffed Cabbage were very bland.

The smoked Polish Keilbasy and the Potato & Cheddar Cheese Pierogi and the Mushroom Pierogi had the most flavor and were quite good. The third pierogi on each platter was so bland I forgot what it was.

But overall, it was a filling but bland lunch."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my father for lunch.  Even though I had never been to S & D's before I was the one who recommended that we eat here since my father is half Polish and half Slovak.  Whenever you walk into the store/restaurant the first thing that you notice is a huge display case and a number of tables and chairs.  Inside of the display case is a bunch of different sausages and many other types of polish food.  Moving beyond that takes you to an area with a huge menu on the wall and then a small window where you can order your hot lunch.  Finally beyond that is a Polish store which has a number of different food items including a number of pierogi's, chocolate and oodles of Polish related items and clothing.

Before we went to the restaurant I had looked at the menu and thought that I would be ordering the Red Borscht and Slovak style haluszki.  However as I was standing at the window about to order I made a game time decision and switched to the White Borscht since I wanted some kielbasy slices instead of dumplings.  My father ended up deciding on the Polish Platter which consisted of 3 potato pierogi's, Pittsburgh haluszki (noodles with cabbage onions and butter), a stuffed cabbage and a drink from the cooler.  After you place your order here you are given a number which is then called through a speaker system when your food is ready.  Whenever our number was called the cashier explained to me that my Slovak haluszki was still finishing cooking and that she would bring it out to me.  So I ended up starting with the White Borscht.  Since I have never White Borscht before I can't really comment too much on it other than it tasted as described on the menu.  It was a semi thick soup with a sour taste which I really enjoyed and I think paired perfectly with the kielbasy pieces which had a smoky flavor to them that cut through the sourness of the soup.  After I had finished my soup the haluski came out.  It was described on the menu as being made of potato noodles with cheese and bacon and came out looking unlike any dish I had ever seen before.  The potato noodles were a beige to brownish color and having a lack of a better way to describe them were somewhat gnocchi like in texture and shape although quite a bit heavier.  They were covered with a soft white cheese and bacon and ended up tasting really good.  My dad also really enjoyed them whenever he tried them.  As for his food he really enjoyed the haluszki, enjoyed the pierogi filling but thought the outer dough was a bit thick and finally thought the stuffed cabbage was just ok.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future and I would especially recommend it to anyone who is of Polish descent.  The food was really good and the store itself a neat place but my favorite part of our lunch was all of the memories that those foods brought back for my father.  He told me stories about my grandparents and great-grandparents that I have never heard before which I loved.  As we were leaving the restaurant he also told me that he would like to go back in the future and take his sister and cousin."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious homemade Polish food ~ no frills decor and atmosphere, but the most delicious pierogis I have ever tasted and a yummy cup of mushroom soup, creamy and bursting with flow or! Such a wonderful treat ~ and a nice stop along Pittsburgh's bustling Strip District!"}
{"text":"Went to the Hometown Homegrown Food Expo at the Heinz History Center, where they had a pierogi contest. After tasting about 4 different restaurants' pierogis (Braddock's, James Street Gastropub, Samantha Stone Catering, & this place), they had the best! Their spinach, kraut & mushroom, and potato & cheddar pierogis were all delicious! I'm going to have make my way to their actual deli now."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our tour of The Strip. We ordered potato pancakes, polish sausage, and several different kinds of pierogies. The service was really slow but everything we ordered was fantastic. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Step into this polish grocery and take a gander at all the candies, snacks and Knick knacks as you walk past the sausage and meat counter. The lunch counter has gems of delicious polish food I'd imagine I'd feast on if we were in Poland, getting treated to a home cooked meal.  The single-digit temperatures were conducive to craving hearty soups. we got the red and white borscht and both were delicious. The red borscht had delectable meat dumplings and a flavorful beet broth although it was a bit sweet for me, my hubby loved it. The white borscht had a white slightly sour broth and pieces of kielbasa. This is the borscht I preferred. We also got a kill Bossi platter that included a juicy delicious Kielbasa (good \"snap\" to the casing), three pierogies, and perfectly cooked and seasoned egg noodles - tender but not over cooked -- comfort food at its best.  The potato and cheddar pierogie was great but I actually fell in love with the mushroom and kraut pierogie!  

Customer service was excellent and you could tell that they took pride in what they served. They have enough room for about maybe 15 to 20 people in their simple seating area."}
{"text":"Best pierogies we have ever had!   We got pierogies and haluski from the refrigerated section and took them home to cook.  We also bought a jar of dinner salad.   Everything was delicious!  Customer service was great as well.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just a little deli shop with a kitchen in the back that makes really good perogies. I ordered the meatless platter and I was not disappointed. Employees were very nice. Will come back definitely when in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"I always hate when I go to a place that has a zillion 5 star reviews and find my experience underwhelming. I always wonder if I caught them on a bad day or if there's something wrong with me. Sadly, I found my lunch at S&D Polish Deli to be one of these \"everybody else loves it but I thought it was ehhh\" experiences.

I went for lunch a couple of Mondays ago, eager to try their pierogies that I've heard so much about. I went around 1pm, and it was packed (huge line), but they took orders quickly. I ordered potato pancakes, haluski, and potato and cheddar pierogies....only to be told that they ran out of potato and cheddar and only had farmer's cheese or mushroom pierogies. Not being a fan of those flavors, I passed on the pierogies altogether, which was hugely disappointing. The annoying thing was that they had a ton of potato and cheddar pierogies for sale in their frozen case that I could plainly see. I was tempted just to buy some and ask them to cook them up for me. I mean, I don't know why they couldn't just take some of the ones they have for sale and use those, but I guess they had their reasons. So right off of the bat, I was super disappointed...I would think that a place specializing in pieorgies should not run out of one of their most basic flavors so early into their lunch service.

So just potato pancakes and haluski it was. I placed my order, got a number, and sat down to wait. I'm not an impatient person, and I understand that restaurants get busy during lunch time. But it took over 30 mins to get my food. Over 30 mins...for a few potato pancakes and some haluski! I don't know if this is typical or not, but at a deli-style takeout place, I was hoping to get my food a little sooner.

Anyway, the food finally came, and I couldn't wait to dig in. Sadly, it was not worth the wait. The potato pancakes were borderline burnt on the bottom, which gave them an unpleasant charred taste. Worse than that, I felt like I basically received a plate of oil with a side of potato pancake. Seriously, these things were swimming in grease....when I would press down on a pancake to cut it, the oil from within the pancake bubbled up to the surface. I understand the pancakes are fried, so obviously a little oil is expected, but these things tasted like nothing but burnt grease. I ate one and it immediately sat in my stomach like a lead balloon, so I had to trash the other two. The haluski was a little better, but nothing notable...no better or worse than haluski I've had elsewhere.

So overall from the lack of cheddar pierogies, to the long wait for food, to the grease-laden bombs that are their potato pancakes, I have to say that I was not too impressed by S&D. That being said, because of their stellar reputation and my love of pierogies, I do plan to go back and hopefully catch them on a day when they have the cheddar flavor in stock to see if I have a better experience. I'll update this review once I'm able to get my paws on some pierogies!"}
{"text":"Although I have no Polish heritage, I have enjoyed Polish cuisine over the years. The perogis and stuffed cabbage were excellent. The kielbasa was tasty and cooked to perfection. It's crowded so you might have to get a meal to take away."}
{"text":"The mushroom pierogi are delicious. I wasn't a fan of the cheddar. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here as part of the Pittsburgh Food tour and for my taste (& money) the pierogis at Forgotten Taste in Moon Township are much better! 

I tried two variations  - cheese and farmhouse and definitely preferred the cheese, as I found the farmhouse to be a bit too tart. I found the texture of the pierogis to be less firm here, hence my not liking them as much.

So I also got to try Hunter's Stew as one person in our foodie tour had a mild milk intolerance and this was basically sausage with sauerkraut- I liked the taste of this and wouldn't mind getting it if return here.

Btw, it was a bit disappointing too, that no-one of Polish origin seemed to be working the shop the day we came - I was all ready to try out the few words of Polish I had picked up while living/ working in Warsaw and when I greeted the staff behind the counter with a hearty  \"Dzie? dobry\" was met with blank looks and they said they didn't speak any Polish!

Yelp Review 65/2017"}
{"text":"We wanted some pierogies, and that's precisely what we got.  And they were delicious.

The service was quick and friendly, and the food was exactly as described, just like you're hoping it'll be.  I recommend getting on down there and getting yourself some if you're on the fence about it."}
{"text":"One word: Polish style haluszki. A large pile of egg noodles mixed with a little cooked cabbage... And then, thick chunks of bacon and farmer cheese piled on top. Sounds kinda boring doesn't it? Trust me, this is some of the most outstanding comfort food I have ever consumed. If this is boring, I am now ok with boring. If this is what life is like in Poland, I'm ready to pack up and go... Well at least back to the Polish Deli anyway. If there was one food I had to eat for the rest of my life...it probably wouldn't be Polish style haluszki, but it would be on the top of my list for sure! 

Ok enough of that. So a plate of haluszki and four meat pierogis is more than enough food for lunch. Go to the S&D Polish Deli and get yours now!"}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time. Being part Polish, I grew up with homemade Polish food. These pierogis are not bad. Well cooked, but these are the smallest pierogis I've ever had. For $6 I would rather go to Pierogis Plus in McKees Rocks & pick up a dozen fat pierogis."}
{"text":"I could have sworn for a couple minutes I was in Gliwice or Krakow, Poland while standing in S&D Polish Deli in the Strip District of downtown Pittsburgh. From the jarred and pickled root vegetables like beets and apples to one of Poland's most popular soups, Zurek, a sour rye soup often served in bread bowls (chunked potatoes and sausage). I was there for the pierogies, the fresh ready-to-eat options were potato and cheddar cheese, potato and farmer's cheese and potato and mushroom. $5 for 4 pierogies. You can order them in or to go - they have maybe 6 - 8 tables but it was a tight fit with the bustling holiday crowd ordering sausages, baked goods and such.

I highly recommend strolling to the back of the store to stock up on their frozen soups: borscht (beet/dumpling soup), mushroom and Zurek. They also have a large freezer filled with at least 10 different types of pierogies to purchase and serve at home. For my next visit, I'll have to try something new like one of the noodle dishes served with sausage and beets. It's all about the beets. I was a wink away from purchasing the Pope John Paul shirt on the wall (fun fact: PPJ was born in Krakow, Poland - I have the earrings, now all I need is the shirt to complete the outfit). This place is as close to Poland as it gets - thank you fellow yelpers for leading me in the right direction;) Or shall I say, Dzi?kuj??"}
{"text":"The dumplings are just SO good!  I love old school places like this.  Didn't have the sausages, but they looked heavenly.  If you're in Pittsburgh, this is a MUST-stop on the strip."}
{"text":"OMGG SO DELICIOUS!!!!!

It can't get any fulfilling than this.  I mean, it's just out of this world good.  Table full of women behind me were moaning after the meal too.  It's absolutely ridiculous, how yummy it is.

Ordered kielbasy platter $11 (comes w/ 1 kielbasy, noodles, 4 pierogies)
Stuffed cabbage $3 (1 piece)
Potato pancakes $5 (3 in a order)
And a pickle

Holy moly, their pickle is to die for.  It's SO good, I could've probably ate 6 more.

Pierogies were so good, we ordered 10 more and stuffed ourselves silly.  The kraut/mushroom pierogies were my fav, it has a tang that makes you go Mmmmm.... The potato cheese one is so good too Jesus Christ...  They'll mix em up, just try them all, they're amazing.  So good!!! Ughhhhh!!!!

If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would want to live here.  Please go.  The women are so friendly and nice.  Omg, I ate so much here!!!  Made my day!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like pierogis, I highly recommend checking out the S&D polish deli in the Strip District. They have some different flavor choices (i.e. Cheese, potato, etc) and other homemade traditional polish food (i.e.: pigs in a blanket) which can be ordered for eating in, takeout or even purchased to cook at home. Food can be ordered and paid for and then brought out when it is ready. 

We were here on a weekend and while it was busy, we were able to get a table. The interior is like a small store/market with a small area with some tables to eat. Service was friendly and pretty quick too. Think in between fast food service and sit down meal. Restroom was available with a key for customers. Prices also very reasonable. 

I will definitely be back to get some delicious pierogis from S&D again!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Tried a bunch of stuff. Haluski, potato pancakes and pierogies were fantastic. Stuffed cabbage and kielbasa were good. Cheap. Really is a deli with a few tables. Go. Best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I might need more than two hands to calculate how many times I've visited Pittsburgh, yet it has completely slipped my mind to have Pierogi. Yes, shame on me. 

There is no city with a greater Polish influence than Pittsburgh, and there is no Polish dish more famous than the Pierogi. The yelp faithful clearly feel S&D is king, so to S&D I go. 

Located in the strip district, there's nothing fancy about this market, just classics dishes that feel like they came out of your adopted polish grandmothers kitchen. 

Aside from the pierogis, i sampled other old world favorites like stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes. It's clear with one bite that these are all homemade from scratch. The pierogis pretty much melt in your mouth, tender and flavorful. 

S&D is the real deal. With prices like these, you are only limited by your stomach. Culinary bucket list check off...."}
{"text":"First meal in Pittsburgh was courtesy of S&D!  Casual dining area inside of a Polish deli/grocery store.

Servings are quite large and totally shareable, especially stuff like the Pierogi Platter, Potato Pancakes.  Best to bring a friend in tow, get a coupla things to share!

Out of the 3 different kinds of pierogis on the platter (krautmush, cheddar/potato, & farmer's cheese), my fav was the cheddar/potato.  Dumplings themselves were quite large and obviously handmade.  

Potato Pancakes were quite large, thick, and primarily crunchy.  So again, they were quite heavy, definitely more than 1 serving.  

Works out to be ~$1/pierogi, so best value again is to share."}
{"text":"Very good original Polish deli.  It is nice to find something authentic and good.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Another 5 star review of S&D.  How about that.

I have to start this off by saying the first time I had S&D's pierogi was at the History Center's Hometown Homegrown event in which they judged about a dozen pierogi from around the city.  S&D's potato and farm cheese were my favorite (sorry, Grandma Urbanik!).  They are incredible.  Like, someone's little Polish grandma is making these.  Literally.  S&D won, by the way.

So this place is 3/4 store selling some serious Polish imports from candy and bakery items to the cheese and prepared foods counter.  If you are looking for anything Eastern European, this is one of the places to start.  Hell, even if you're looking for your lamb butter mold for Easter, get it here. 
The other 1/4 is restaurant counter service.  They have platters and big plates to share, but I usually get my own plate of not fried pierogi.  The farm cheese is always the \"special\" of the day when I'm there somehow so it ends up being painfully cheap too.  Like I said, these are so great.  The potato pancakes are also done perfectly.  Being picky, I can't say much for the haluski or kielbasy (\"you don't know what's good!\", responds everyone in my family).

They also sell gift boxes of sweets and/or sausages as well as Polish gift/heritage items.  Lanters, Matrioszka dolls, t shirts, you know.  So if babcia needs a birthday gift, get down to the end of the strip.  You must, must, must have these pierogi while you're around."}
{"text":"It was crowded. It was no frills. We had to wait for a table and swoop on in as soon as two people stood up to leave. But oh boy, was it delicious. 

I ordered the Polish Platter ($11.00) which included 3 pierogi, haluszki, and stuffed cabbage. The haluszki was delightful. Pierogi were better than my great grandmas (don't tell Buba) and the stuffed cabbage was almost as good (Buba makes the best stuffed cabbage in the history of the world).

Everything was swimming in butter and that made me very happy."}
{"text":"I would rate this deli more than FIVE stars if I could! The food is Fantastic and the service is quick and friendly. Lots of options but the pierogis are a Must! Very authentic, tastes just like our last trip to Poland :)
We tried a couple pastry options on our last visit and were very happy with our selections. 
This is one of our \"Go To\" places anytime we visit Pittsburgh. We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow!  Simply wow, this place is amazing. If you like Polish food you need to go here for lunch. The Polish platter was delicious, it was just like grandma's home cooking.  The pierogies were cooked to perfection in butter and onions;  the haluszki was fantastic, the noodles were nice and buttery and the cabbage had just a little crunch, and the cabbage roll was moist and full of flavor. Also tried the smoked kielbasa with kraut and potato pancakes, both were great too.  A must stop for lunch while in the strip district."}
{"text":"Driving through Pittsburgh and stopped in. Okay for the price and what you get. Very greasy potato pancakes and doughy pierogi.  Wouldn't go back unless this poppyseed roll I have is good. Keep you posted."}
{"text":"They were out of cabbage rolls when we arrived at 1 pm.  Next time we'll have to get there earlier!  I ordered the meatless platter and my husband had the kielbasa platter.  The pirogies were wonderful!  The cabbage and noodles were average - bland and swimming in butter.  I grew up on this food and was slightly disappointed with the potato pancakes(greasy)and kielbasa (way over cooked nearly burnt).  I would  like to give it another try to see if it was just a fluke.  We did get one piece of kielbasa from the deli and it was very good.  Went with high expectations and left a little disappointed."}
{"text":"The deli has a wide selection of polish meats, mustards, frozen perogies, and canned goods such as pickles and turnips. They also have a service counter that cooks polish specialties such as kielbasa and perogies."}
{"text":"Yeah, they have great peirogies, and halushki, and desserts, and meats, and the taste appeals to picky eaters and food snobs alike and no one ever suspects this to be such a great place and everyone is so nice and everything else that everyone talks about that contributes to a solid run-on-sentence about one of the most visited and reviewed places in the Strip District or probably Pittsburgh in general.

I'll keep taking my friends here when they come to visit, but what really keeps me coming back is the Cracovia Super Extra Hot Mustard. It's an import and it's sincerely the greatest mustard I've ever had. Serve it with some latkes; mix it with honey and sugar for a good chicken nugget dipping sauce; put a spoonful into a roux for a spicy edge to your mac and cheese; spread it on some bread for your cold cuts; or, let's be honest, just eat a little bit with a spoon every time you see it in the fridge.

Buy some Cracovia Super Extra Hot Mustard, and treat yourself to some good Polish lunch while you're at it. If you don't like the mustard, let me know, and I can name a few dozen people who would be glad to take it off your hands. Nawet drwala powala!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was good. I don't remember the items I ordered or pronounce them. If you never tried polish food then you start trying it here."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh and what do you eat? Polish food!!! On our drive in I convinced boyfriend to stop at this deli for an authentic polish lunch..all I really wanted were pierogis!

We found street parking easily and made our way in. There was a huge line at the deli counter..we took a quick glance and could see why! Tons of smoked meats and polish delights!

Walk back a little further and there are single and communal tables for dining and a very small window to place your order. We stared at the menu for a long time before deciding on the polish platter. This included pierogis, stuffed cabbage and haluski. He also ordered red borsht which I was pretty excited to try! You pay at the window and they hand you a number..find a seat and wait.

The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of the extreme smoke coming from the kitchen and the cold temps inside..

They finally called out our number to grab our tray of food. The pierogis were absolutely perfect..buttery and warm..sautéed just right. The stuffed cabbage was in a deliciously sweet tomato sauce which kind of melded with the butter from the haluski..so delicious. 

Pretty sure I won't have to do much convincing to get him to go back tomorrow too!"}
{"text":"If you want a warm, heart meal...go here! You will never leave hungry from this restaurant. I was very happy by the humble look of everything and the extremely friendly staff. The table are family style, so you really feel good eating here. I wish I took some frozen perogies back with me, but they would never be as good as getting them fresh made from here!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Don't hate me pleaseeee.

Atmosphere: deli in the front, food and seating in the back. Extra casual. Came in a Saturday at noon and it was crowded but people come in and out and it wasn't too hard to snag a table. 

Food: All aboard the train to carbstown and starchville. Not complaining about that fact, these foods are true polish staples, just stated as a note to come prepared hungry and leave knowing you'll have a lot of carbs in the belly :) kielbasy platter and an order of potato pancakes for two people. Everything is reasonably priced, especially for the portions. The kielbasa was good, but on the drier side. The pierogis were tasty, however I asked if they could do one cheddar and potato and two potato and farmers cheese since the partner doesn't like mushrooms. The hostess wrote it down on the receipt, but unfortunately the cooks gave us one potato and cheddar cheese and TWO sauerkraut and mushroom. I realize I could've said something, but I had already shoved half of the pierogis in my mouth lol. Either way, they're good and filling and there is strong flavors of cheddar cheese and the tang of sauerkraut in each respective pierogi. What takes the cake here is the haluszki. It's light, flavorful, and has a bit of a pepper kick to it. I could seriously come back to just eat a whole plate of this. The noodles were perfectly cooked too, not too mushy or not too hard. 

Potato pancakes were a little too oily, but they were crunchy and tasted like what you would expect. 

Also stopped by the deli to get a lemon-filled polish doughnut, which was airy and filled with lots of lemon jelly-like filling. 

Service: very friendly people work here. It's comforting. The guy at the deli let us try some of the Moscow ham for free and it was delicious."}
{"text":"When you're making pierogies, this is the place for flour and fillings. Using the right dough is life changing! Great customer service. Will return time and time again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday while they had a street grill going. I ordered the kielbasa sandwich. 

The kielbasa is nicely executed. It's smoky, crisp-skinned, and carries a complex eastern european flavor profile. The horseradish/beet red relish was very nice on this sandwich.

However, the sandwich is very imbalanced. There is too much bread. There was too much sauerkraut. The meat was not allowed to shine in the sandwich."}
{"text":"Traveled from Houston on my way to Erie I had heard about this place and really wanted to try it. The hours state that they're open til 4:30 and says they serve lunch til \"3:30ish.\"  We get there at 3:07pm and are told that lunch ends at 3pm.  Well if lunch ends at 3pm why not put that on yelp?  Or your website?  Was really looking forward to some kielbasa and pierogies but I had to settle for the pizza place around the corner. Sad"}
{"text":"Delightful lunch surprise - I yelped something while my friend had taken me to the Strip District during my visit. 

It was a bit of a bargain, too. My friend and I split the pierogi platter, some stuffed cabbage rolls, and potato pancakes. 

The sour cream was a little sweet, which I thought was odd. But all three varieties of pierogi were delicious. The cabbage rolls were tender and tasty, and the potato pancakes were a little oily, but also good. 

Would definitely go again during another visit."}
{"text":"Living 15 min from Alexandra Foods in Chicago, my go to place for pierogi, I was pleasantly surprised that their pierogi made it to Pittsburgh. Bit overpriced for my taste 4 pierogi for $6, but otherwise great selection of deli meats and cheeses and other Polish items including Polish themed t-shirts."}
{"text":"Easily the best pierogi I've ever eaten. Wife feels the same way. This is seriously amazing food. Have lunch. Good price. Great selection of meats and polish candies."}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday after dining at Penn Avenue Fish Company and found a most delectable Polish cheesecake. Peppered with coconut, it almost reminded me of a tiramisu with its subtle sweetness and silky texture. I even got a free Polish lollipop! Kay walked out with some Polish sausages that filled the car with an intoxicating, carnivorous aroma. S&D is an ethnic gem in a part of town overflowing with them."}
{"text":"Great quality polish food, old school joint, and inexpensive prices. This is a place I wish I could have brought my grandmother. 

S&D is a solid joint busting your favorite polish dishes. Cabbage, sausages, pirogies, they got it all. We got here close to the end of their business day. After stuffing our faces with a couple of sandwiches, my friend wasn't sure if we could eat here. I let him know it wouldn't be a problem for me. 

Everything was delicious and I left more than satisfied. This seems like a wonderful option for a cheap lunch in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! The best pierogies I've had in a long time. The deli is at the front half along with a lot of Polish snacks and foods. In the back half is a window where you order and a sit down area. It isn't fancy but my goodness the pierogies are out of this world! I got the farmers cheese and the mushroom and sauerkraut types. I fried the cheese and got the mushroom and kraut pierogies boiled. I preferred the fried version. You can also take frozen or fresh pierogies home for later if you'd like. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"Coming from Detroit, we knew we had to try Pittsburgh's Polish food scene. Every website recommended this place and it did not disappoint! Very good food (first time I ever tried haluszki!) and grocery! Casual, economical, homemade."}
{"text":"I don't really see the big deal. Pittsburgh should not claim to be a city that has Polish-forward cuisine if this place is meant to be representative. I like my pierogies with a bit more chew (such as the ones I had when I visited Szczecin, Poland). The ones here have too high a ratio of wrapper to filling and they were over cooked to the point where they became soggy. 

I also found the fillings slightly off-putting. They tend to stuff their pierogies with sautéed veggies and cheese, which is absolutely fine, but their fillings were also too wet so the pierogies only had one texture upon consumption: mushy. 

In terms of cleanliness, perhaps I made the mistake of eating here, but I felt very uncomfortable by how old the pastries in the display cabinet appeared and by the abundance of crumbs on the ground. 

If they can figure out how to properly cook pierogies, I may consider coming back"}
{"text":"Named best pierogies in Pittsburgh and I support it. Delicious pierogies well worth the wait. I got the pierogi platter. Came with 4 krautmush, 4 chedder, 4 farmers cheese. All cooked well and tasted great! You may eat in or take out, I got take out because I needed to catch my bus. This was my last meal in Pittsburgh. Will definitely need to stop by again to try the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"My coworkers all swear by this place so I had to eventually check it out. I'm not familiar with Polish cuisine so this was an eye opener. The store itself is like a deli/corner grocery store rather than a restaurant. There were only 2 tables for seating so either the lines are super long or you have to get them perogies to go! 

It's cash-only which is a no-no in my book. The dishes behind the glass counter didn't look or smell all that appealing to me. I split a beef perogie meal with my hubby and the taste was okay, not bad. They are like European dumplings, so if you have never had a real dumpling before, then I guess this is fine but I'm a dumpling/bao zi/dim sum connoisseur so perogies just pale in comparison. The wrapper is kind of hard and thick and the filling is very bland. I did, however, very much enjoy the onion butter black pepper sauce on top. That was lip-smackingly good. The haluski pasta side was also buttery, smooth and delicious. 

Kind of expensive for the small amount of food you get. Good for a little snack but does not quite do it for me for an entree."}
{"text":"Visiting from Orlando,  FL. Yum! This gem is a small deli/ grocery store. They cook them to order so be prepared to wait a little bit. Ordered the Kielbasy Platter. It came with one kielbasa, 3 pierogies and some pasta. 

The pierogies and kielbasa were delicious but the pasta was a little bit dry. 

It is an inexpensive little place and the food is tasty. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Came here because I heard they had the best pierogis in town. These pierogis did not disappoint. We got 1 order of the cheddar cheese ones that include 4 pierogis. Tasted like a Mac n cheese potato dumpling! What more could you ask for. Seating can be limited depending what time you go but seats open up at you wait for your food. They offer the pierogis to be fired for an extra $1 but we got the cooked ones and they come in like a cheesy milky buttery sauce. Not sure exactly what the sauce is but it's delicious with the pierogis. If you're in the area I would definitely recommend these as a snack!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Polish deli. Stuffed cabbage was delicious! The prices are reasonable - $3 per stuffed cabbage, $6 for stew, and $5 for the cabbage, kielbasa and mushroom dish. All were very good, but the cabbage was the best. I got my order to go. They also have Polish clothing and souvenirs, groceries, candies, and deli items. The home made pickles are also very good. They have a freezer in the back with frozen dishes as well. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing pierogis and potato pancakes! I ordered the mixed and matched pierogis - cheddar, farm cheese and Kraut & mushroom! This place is a must to stop by while you are in the district!"}
{"text":"The perogies are were its at! I'm biased but I'd skip the rest of the menu (not much of an eastern european food fan tbh) and just eat the perogies. 

They have three regular perogie flavors and have a daily special flavor on rotation. The three regular flavors are cheddar potato, farmers cheese and potato, and kraut and mushrooms. My favorite were the kraut ones because they funny enough, remind me of chinese dumplings and I am a big mushroom fan. 

I could have done without the keilbasa sausage I got. It was pretty hard and dry when I got it and I mainly ordered it for the kraut, which was unremarkable (made with pork but rather two-dimensional.)"}
{"text":"I'm not a qualified pierogi expert, but I liked our orders of the potato and farmers cheese (4 for $5) as well as the sweet cheese (4 for $4). I think these are what authentic (i.e, not vegan or hipsterized) pirogies are supposed to be like. They were simple and hit the spot for a quick morning snack. S&D Deli is a good place to start if you're attempting a food crawl of Pittsburgh with visitors."}
{"text":"Great food. We will definitely be back.  We had only pierogis and all were amazing.  particularly, I loved the kraut and meet combination and the farmers cheese by itself.  Next time, I will get both of those and maybe some kraut by itself, as that must be good as well.  Although the insides play a big part, the dough of the pierogis were exceptional and you could tell that they were very fresh and homemade.  Thank you.  

Note, that most of the other stores in the neighborhood are very touristy.  That's just an FYI."}
{"text":"I came for the pierogies, and I was not let down. This was my second stop for food in the strip district. We had already had a good sized meal next door, so we just shared a plate. I prefer mine cooked, rather than fried. They have several different flavors to choose from, and they are sort of swimming in this really nice butter sauce. They were very well done and great comfort food. I have no complaints, it is very stripped down and to the point. I enjoyed very much and would go back again and again"}
{"text":"I am originally from Chicago and this is by far the best Polish deli I have been to since I left Chicago.  We ate lunch here and had the red Borsht, pierogi platter and Kielbasi platter and I feel like I am back home. The food is amazing and prices are really great!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Pittsburgh if you like East European food. I have been to Poland and this deli makes authentic delicious food.  Anything you order is good, but I prefer the cheese pierogies and sauerkraut pierogies. The halushkj is also great.  Take home some Wawel chocolate for dessert!"}
{"text":"Some of you know my real last name. It is Polish and difficult for Americans to pronounce. Some of you also know that I lived in Central Europe for two years.  Thus, I have thankfully experienced authentic Polish cuisine.  Walking into S&D reminds me of being back in Kraków! Pleasant staff chatting in Polish, magazines with extraneous amounts of the letter \"z.\", and the smell of delicious pierogi!

I always pick up a few candy bars and other Polish food items, but I usually go there for lunch. My favorite items are the (authentic) halusky with farmer's cheese, and the kraut/mushroom pierogi. 

After I'm finished, I also grab some frozen pierogi from the freezer and order some sausage from the deli. The staff is always helpful.

So why the docked star? First of all, sometimes service in the lunch area is painfully slow.  Also, mostly on weekends, often half the lunch menu is unavailable by noon! I realize this is because S&D is popular and they use fresh ingredients. But I love my brunch halusky and am disappointed when it isn't available. 

Overall, however, I adore this place and stop in every time I am in the Strip District."}
{"text":"Oh My God!  Best pierogies ever! So glad I found this place. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will stock up to bring home!"}
{"text":"I'm not Polish, but I might be after eating here. I've had countless of things on their menu. I can never come out for lunch around noon, so around 2-3pm I may stumble in here for a few pierogies. I have had their traditional cheese and potato , and today I had their kraut and mushroom. Always good. I tried for the first time, their Bigos. I love any form of vegetable and they had cabbage a d few other vegetables in here. It was on the salty side, but still edible. place is always nicely laid out. I love their selection of chocolates.  I had this little piece of chocolate called tiramisu. I forgot the name. but it's bite size. Perfect after a little lunch. Will come back here when I can. Love the inventive pierogies."}
{"text":"Authentic Polish food! Priced well! Nalesniki was delicious! Highly recommend it! It was a nice reunion for me and my old friends from Duff's. They were in town and wanted a taste of Pittsburgh so this place was perfect. It would be helpful to have more restrooms. The combination of mayo and sour cream, was not our favorite.The Polish style haluszki was awesome!"}
{"text":"Gimme those sweet beets any day. I love the women who work there, too. Very helpful and accommodating."}
