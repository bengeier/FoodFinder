{"text":"This is literally my fav chinese restaurant in Vegas. They had such greet food and boba teas!"}
{"text":"Nice small spot behind the Walgreens store. Have ordered twice and was happy each pick up. Very Friendly and super accommodating.  Reasonably priced and super fast prep when you make order to take out. When at our son's this will be our Go To for take out Chinese food.  Easy parking as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the combination rice, sesame beef, beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and green bean chicken   All if it was delicious. The service was fast and friendly. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food was ah maz ing! The fried rice tasted fresh. The sesame chicken was the perfect crisp. They ran out of boba but my coconut drink was still great! I will be ordering again very soon"}
{"text":"The Short:
It's definitely worth a visit. Quick and delicious Chinese. 

The Long-ish:

What we ordered:

Orange Chicken:
Solid. Nuff said. 

Szechwan Chicken:
By far my favorite thing we ordered. Nice level of spice and great flavor. Vegetables weren't over cooked and mush

Salt and Pepper Wings:
These were 4/5 for sure. Loved the flavor and the spice level. 

Chow Fun:
Solid nothing special, but definitely solid.

Looking for a quick dinner but don't want that fake Chinese stuff from Panda, hit this place up. People running the spot are super chill and polite. They hooked it up with potstickers just because I had to wait 15 minutes. Say what?! Wish more places did that."}
{"text":"Really great chinese restaurant. I order delivery more than I actually eat there, but thats part of the reason Im giving them 5 stars. The food is always correct and delicious, even when I ask for modifications or extra of something. Its also delivered super quick and the driver is friendly. The staff at the restaurant are really nice and they speak good English, which is nice at a mom and pop chinese place. Recommend to anyone wanting affordable and simple Chinese."}
{"text":"I was sent by a friend, and I had a very enjoyable dinner! The service there was very good and the food was even better. If you're looking for some good Chinese food, I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"We called in an order for pick up. It was hot and ready. They greeted me and seemed genuinely welcoming. The food was packed well and nothing leaked on the way home. The food was tasty. My picky eater (9yr.old) was happy with his dinner. We will order again."}
{"text":"The service is AMAZING and they make you feel at home. I'm here with a friend and we live within a 1 mile radius of here and would DEFINITELY recommend this place for any in the area!"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery only.  I had ordered through them via Grubhub a couple of weeks ago.  They were super busy and it took quite a while.  When we called them, the nice lady answering the phone apologized profusely and said her son was on the way.
Fast forward to today when I ordered off the Yelp app.  I am guessing it wasn't as busy because my food seemed to have arrived as I hit the send button.  
So onto the food... deliciousness.  I have tried the orange chicken, sesame beef, and pineapple chicken.  I highly recommend the orange chicken... some of the best I've had since living in Henderson.  The only downfall for me is the onions in the fried rice.  I am just not an onions in rice kinda girl. Otherwise, the food tastes fresh, good pieces of chicken and beef, and lots of it.  
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We recently stopped and dined in here.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was very attentive and pleasant.  The food was fantastic!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is really good and it's a local business so that's even better! The owner is super nice and gave us potstickers while we wait. The food is quality and it's pretty quick too. This will be my Chinese food place of choice! Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Lunch Specials!!!  I often order from here to be delivered at home but stopping by for a quick lunch is just as good if not better:  fast courteous service with great atmosphere.  Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place when it was still called Little Dumpling. The food is always good and the delivery is always fast. It's a great place for a quick meal.

I recommend the orange chicken and the combination fried rice. Plus they always throw in an eggroll or a crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Absolutely our family's favorite Chinese restaurant- hands down. We've ordered from here continuously since it changed from the former business, Little Dumplings. The food is always great tasting, never stale or old and everything is piping hot when delivered. We live in the apts right next to it and the guy that always delivers is always super friendly and arrives earlier than the predicted delivery time. They are even open on major holidays so in true \"Christmas Story\" fashion we ordered on Xmas and it was wonderful. They really take care of you here and it shows. Even when we move- we will travel the extra bit to pick up food from here so that our kids have one of those traditional delicious \"grew up going there\" awesome joints in memory :)"}
{"text":"Food approved ! My kids loved the orange chicken, chow mein, and devoured the fried rice (which is really saying something because they're total carnivores). Delivery with GrubHun was fast and you can't beat the price of the lunch special. They are very generous with the portions. Oh and the egg drop soup - to die for. I love soup and they really did a bang up job. I stood in the kitchen and ate the whole thing without a pause. All in all I greatly recommend this place. I didn't it give a 5 because I haven't been to the establishment or dealt with any staff... I ordered straight through yelp and had delivery. If I ever visit I will update my review."}
{"text":"Delivery came early but the food was kinda bland. We had War Won Ton Soup which was garlicky... Yum!  Singapore Rice Noodles were really eh... Beef with Broccoli was okay per the hubby. Undecided on whether or not we'd order again."}
{"text":"Delivery was a disaster. Over an hour wait, so the orange beef was soggy. The bag was obviously tipped upside down as  the sauce was not in the boxes but in the bag. Dripping every where. Total mess. And to make bad worse no utensils, no chop sticks. A puddle of sauce on the counter and carpet, dry soggy food and no utensils. Maybe the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"This restaurant took the place of Little Dumplings (Stephanie and Horizon Ridge right next to Starbucks and Walgreens). We looked at the menu and the pineapple chicken caught our eye since it's not on any other menu in the area. It was chicken in a batter (like sweet and sour)  with just a few chunks of pineapple. The batter did not have any flavor of pineapple but it was good. Egg drop soup was excellent.  Beef with broccoli was excellent, very tender flavorful beef, excellent broccoli. I was not a fan of the egg rolls but I haven't found any good ones in the area yet. Fried rice was good. Vegetable lo mein was good, slightly gummy.  Employees were very nice and friendly. Will definitely return to try out other items on the menu especially the beef noodle soup which says on the menu is one of their specialties."}
{"text":"Hands down it is the best Pad Thai I have found in our area, Henderson near Sunset Station. The bad is their satay chicken was like rubber .. unchewable really, perhaps over over done? the egg rolls too hard, not soft and moist. The other dishes Were really good though, Id order again from them just for the Pad Thai. Loved the Chow Mein as well. Excellent Walnut Shrimp. This restaurant will serve you as you ask. I ask no STYROFOAM. And I do not get Styrofoam. Boxes or plastic box used. Glad they Listen to the no styrofoam, even the lady there calls you to clarify no styrofoam. Good customer care. Thanks \"Lucky China\"."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from them many times, and they never disappoint. Even with delivery the food is always warm and fresh. The salt and pepper shrimp is one of my long time favorites, but for family dinners with picky little ones the orange chicken is sure to be a delight. Everyone I've interacted with has always been polite and kind. Sure to keep ordering in the future!"}
{"text":"Great food a little pricey great portions though. Many different things to choose from. Wonton soup is good, I like there house lo Maine, it has chicken, shrimp and beef in it. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I just moved in town 4 months ago. I eat here often.  have had takeout probably 15 times. Good food. Have had numerous menu items including appetizers and entries. Always greeted by a friendly staff and  they always  give me free egg rolls and a fountain drink while waiting."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a quick work lunch. I was very impressed with the customer service. The place was clean and food was great for a quick Chinese food restaurant. I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch specials and quick chinese eats. Plenty of parking outside and easy to find."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Bring back little dumplings. It's like the same stuff but what happened to the flavor? And all our noodles were super soggy."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever. I have been looking for a place with really good low mein and seriously when I had it I just wanted more. This is the place to go for Chinese take out!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. The staff is extremely nice and the lunch specials are great. There's enough food in each lunch entree for another meal +"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and traditional American Chinese style food. They offer Thai selections too etc. it's very well-priced and much better than any fast food option for Chinese."}
{"text":"Good little place. Super inexpensive and they were friendly. Really liked our food, not too greasy. Lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall restaurant! Staff is friendly and helpful!
Food is yummy and delicious and portions are great! Boba drinks are available and super delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is my second post this week. My first visit was for Kung pow today we ordered for our whole family and tried mushu pork, fried eggplant, sesame chicken, beef broccoli, lo mein, bbq ribs, and walnut shrimp our objective was to get a variety of dishes to test flavors. Our combined opinion was that this new Mgmt has it right. The dishes we're excellent and the ribs were a meal In themselves. Egg rolls are ok. We continue to recommend them and their excellent food.
Came in for lunch today 4/2/18 it seems that the staff did not get the message about customer care. Poor lunch service:no noodles with soup, no egg roll, poor music choices, lights out, hot inside 77 degrees but food still good."}
{"text":"food is delicious! lao mien is very unique and tasty. Lots of amount for an order. Love the place."}
{"text":"My favorite place In Vegas for Chinese food love it so much. I will recommend this place to anyone who loves Chinese food great prices an the flavor is amazing. War won ton soup is my favorite great flavor have not had anything better. It's good all year around. Salt and pepper shrimp is so good from here combination noodles are to die for this is a must if your in Henderson... I WILL SAY ONE THING THEY NEED MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYEE WORKING AT NIGHT BECAUSE I ALWAYS WAIT FOR A LONG TIME TO PLACE MY ORDER the..."}
{"text":"Update on my recent visit for lunch. I definitely recommend this place for lunch. It was a different lady working the front and she was very enthusiastic and pleasing on the phone, and in person as well. 
I went with the beef teriyaki bowl today, and it's a pretty good size and tastes great! $5-something after taxes too and you can't beat that! 
She also threw in 2 free egg rolls free of charge randomly. How nice!
Thanks again Lucky China. I'll continue coming for lunch when in need."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here--everything was pretty tasty! Food was ready to go for pick up on time, everything was really hot and they even gave me some free egg rolls with my order! The fried rice was especially good and I also like that they offer Hong Kong style noodles. Wish they had sizzling rice soup, but I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and get Lucky China for take out all the time. It is always delicious. Tried various things such as Singapore Noodle, Chicken teriyaki, hot pepper chicken. Everything is great. We love this place. The customer service is also awesome! My wife and I will continue to come back to this neighborhood Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"New owner of  formerly Little Dumpling.  I ordered orange chicken, received a delicious , hot dish and the order was a lot of food.  The other dish was stir fried chicken an asparagus.  Large size chicken pieces and a lot of asparagus, also well made: note could have a bit more black bean to flavor.  Over all delicious an hot, order came at a reasonable time. New owner will have new menu in a week or so."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Very friendly, welcoming staff!
Food is delicious and restaurant is very clean. Highly recommend for all to visit!!!
Plus they deliver!!! Great spot."}
{"text":"This is a great little Chinese restaurant and everything about it was incredible. The price is very reasonable, the quality of the food is great and the service is impeccable. They saw my father in law was having trouble getting out of the car and came out of the restaurant and helped him. Very nice touch. I have no problem recommending this place to anyone who likes affordable, quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood chines joint.  We ordered one of the family dinners and it was enough for 5 or six people.  They give huge servings and very reasonable prices!

Very good service.  

It's just right for week day dinner when you don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"I love that they have a delivery option. To be quite honest, I have never seen the physical location. Every time I have ordered delivery from them, the food arrived fresh and pipping hot. I'm very pleased with the quality of food as well. The dishes were all well seasoned and the ingredients were very fresh. A bit on the oily side but, that's common in Chinese food."}
{"text":"We will be back!! Had the family combo dinner and it was huge portions and very delicious!! Also added shrimp egg foo young and it was really good. Staff was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Honey shrimp too sweet and mushy.  Lemon chicken over cooked.  Pork fried rice too dry.  Seafood delight was pretty good.  Sweet and sour pork mediocre.  Friendly service was excellent.  My first visit so I'll give it another go.  They might have been too busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"We just tried this restaurant for the first time.  The food was excellent. This will be our \"go-to\" place for Chinese food from now on!"}
{"text":"We yelped to find a Chinese restaurant and found Lucky China. The service was great and food was great, too! We are visiting from California and were starving after winning Gold at our dragon boat race. It hit the spot! #losangelespinkdragons"}
