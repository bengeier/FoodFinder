{"text":"I loved the nutella pies here as well as the freshly baked cookies. In summer it is lovely to sit out on their patio (the girly pink patio furniture won me over). My only issue was that when I went at 2pm or so on a Saturday afternoon, all their savoury products were gone! That means they were absolutely delicious , can't wait to try them the next time I visit. I wish they had more regular hours too (I went one saturday and they were closed:("}
{"text":"Really excellent baking  by Lilly -- old fashioned not too sweet pies in amazing pastry, lovely rich cupcakes and cookies, elegant fruit tarts.  And good coffee.   The front of shop  proprietors are friendly. The place is charmingly, funnily, pink.  Like a birthday all the time.  And if you don't want to sit inside with your laptop or outside under the very pretty tree, it's a bakery too -- take stuff home!.   They have gluten free options; and while a lot of  the baking has nuts, they've been very helpful to our nut allergy family, and we've had no problems."}
{"text":"After going for brunch at the Stockyards, Baked on Lauder is a quick walk for a coffee or treat.  We entered the pink walled pretty bakery, and were immediately craving sweets.  Their baked goods are displayed on different leveled cake plates, which leaves your eyes to wonder from cookie to whoopie pie to tart.  Their Nutella pies looked really good, and we will definitely get one next time.  We just ordered a chocolate chip whoopie pie with peanut butter frosting.  We were planning on sharing it and the owner was nice enough to split it for us.  The whoopie pie was delicious, however it wasn't a true whoopie pie, it was a variation because typically they are made with cake.  However the cookie was so good, it won me over on flavour, and i love the whole peanuts in the cookie, it gave great texture.  The whoopie pie was great, i just wish the cookies were slightly softer because the filling crept out once you bit down on it.  Overall great selection, friendly service, definitely a winner."}
