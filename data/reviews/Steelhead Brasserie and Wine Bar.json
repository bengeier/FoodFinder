{"text":"So my dad and I are in pittsburgh for the penguins playoff game tomorrow. We got in and decided to stay at the Marriott this restaurant is in. After we were done unpacking, we went downstairs and decided to eat at this restaurant. I was greeted very politely by the manager who sat us down. He told us that our server would be right with us and that if there was anything wrong with out experience to associate with him. So our server came and greeted us. My father ordered a red zin wine and this is were everything came to a disaster. I don't want to bad talk the server because he was really nice and it wasn't his fault but the bars. First he gave my dad a white wine. Ha that's funny because zins are red. So my dad told the waiter that he ordered a red not a white wine and the server gave us his Sincerest apologizes and took it back. Another waiter asked if he ordered a merlot, to which my father said no and told them what he ordered. So the other waiter apologized and left. Finally my dad got his wine and we ordered an appetizer. We ordered the chips and onion dip which our server said was homemade. He brings us the chips and they look like they have been pulled out of a factory made bag. I could tell it was not homemade. Not only that but we got like 5 chips! When someone says something is homemade I expect it to be homemade. So we order dinner, we ordered the same thing. The bacon cheeseburger. I expect a lot from any burger I eat because I know good for bad in that department. I could tell the meat was most likely steamed as it looked white-ish. My dad enjoyed it but I thought it was terrible. I asked the waiter for a side of aioli for my fries and he went to go fetch it. But you know what he came back with? Bacon jam. Seriously? How do you mess that up? So we eat then we decided to try dessert. I got the ice cream sandwhich which was expresso ice cream with some sort of salty sweet chocolate thing to put on top and bottom of it. It was way to salty to be considered a dessert. My dad ordered a cobbler. He said the ice cream was good but the cobbler was absolutely terrible. I do not recommend this place and will not ever come back here."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat while in town on business close to the Marriott in downtown Pittsburgh.  I settled on this place because it was within walking distance.  I like to give places a chance even though the ratings are not good.  I was sadly disappointed.  I ordered a regular chicken noodle soup and a salmon entree.  How could that be messed up?  The chicken soup was full of leftover chicken with very little broth.  The salmon with vegetables were extremely salty.  It was shriveled and overcooked.  I would not return because the quality was just not there.  The service was mediocre at best.  Not very attentive while there was hardly anyone in there on a random weeknight.  This is perhaps just a bar place for drinks and watching a game.  Not meant for good eats."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a business meeting.  Will keep this brief because I don't want to spend much more time on this than they spent on thinking about the food.

You can go just about anywhere in Pittsburgh for more value and taste for the money -- including just blocks away at the Bigelow Grille @ The Doubletree Hotel (in case you just like eating at hotel restaurants).

Ordered the grouper.  It was $31.  The fish was very average in every way.  It came with about 5 grains of reheated rice and a stripe of sauce on the plate that somehow incorporated the vegetable (cauliflower).  If it had a pro, it was probably that it was a low-cal dish.  Yep, there was about 200 calories worth of food on the plate.  Man, am I hungry.

The whole experience screamed \"how much profit can we make since someone was stupid enough to come in eat here?\" ... looked around at other plates, including those at my table.  Much of the very sad same."}
{"text":"Well, we went for a lunch with couple of friends once and our experience was good. Especially liked their sweet french fries. So, I thought we will take a few out of town visitors - big mistake. Six of us walked in about 7 in the evening, and had no reservation.  We went to the booth, no one was there to greet or receive. The place was empty, that should have been a hint.. Waited there for good five minutes and then started making some noises, finally one server showed up. Gave us a table, a good table, not bad. The server was not clear, she gave only one wine menu for all of us - really! Drinks came on time, no issue but the glasses looked less than adequate. Did they give enough - who's measuring? We ordered food - some of the dishes were expensive. Two of us ordered monk-fish. Never seen such a dish, looked more like a soup - a bland one at best. The quantity was also not much for $29 - really. Two of us ordered steak which was also quite small. One of us ordered salmon burger, that one looked okay. But when the server delivered the food, she spilled fried all over. They did not try to accommodate that - they should have at least replaced the fries. What kind of service is that. Not going there any time soon - not good at all."}
{"text":"Honey martini...my new favorite drink!  Food is good and price is reasonable.  Chowder is creamy and hot...just as it should be:-)"}
{"text":"Came here before a Pens hockey game. Sat in the strange area that was in between the main dining room and the wine bar. Felt like we were eating a meal in the lobby. It had the bar menu though, and it was a comfy seat, so I was at least happy about that. The staff was attentive and answered all our questions. But....then came the food. I have been staying at Marriott hotels my whole life. I have come to expect a higher caliber from my Marriott experiences and this was not it. You can do better than Steelhead, Marriott.

I ordered the clam chowder, which I was told was their popular item. It came out looking like chunky sausage gravy. It had obviously been sitting in a hot kettle since morning because most of the water had evaporated from it and was no longer a soup consistency. The clams were chewy and way over cooked. The flavor wasn't bad, but it was too strong due to the lack of water. Maybe if you had it for lunch it would be good since it would have sat in the kettle less. We also ordered the crab nachos. Little bit of crab and a lot of chalky cheese sauce. My husband ordered a Manhattan and got a fruity drink in a highball glass. Overall, I won't be coming back here except for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here last night for 7pm upon arriving we waiting at the front desk for about 10 minutes before anyone helped us. Finally someone asked if we needed help and we told them we had a reservation they preceded to tell us that the restaurant was not open but the café was so we could take our seat there. We took our seat and were given a café menu. We had already looked at the normal menu online and knew what we were getting and were disappointed it was not on the café menu. So we asked our waiter if there was anyway we could order off the other menu since when we made the reservation no one told us the restaurant wasn't going to be open. The manager came over and let us order off of the menu but then when we got our bill we were up charged for the items we got which we were not told about. Also when the manager took our order we told him we wanted one rare and one medium rare steak. When the steaks came out the waiter put them in as one medium rare and one rare and this problem was not corrected. Although they try to accommodate us it worked out less in our favor then in our favor and we were very unhappy."}
{"text":"Looking for a nearby establishment to enjoy a beer and watch the MLB playoffs, I stumble across the Steelhead, an upscale bar with friendly wait staff. I enjoyed my time there but see nothing special with it. Know that I am willing to pay for experience - and offer the following. Be prepared to pay $5 for domestic draft beers that excludes gratuity. My experience was no more special than another bar that serves adult beverages in front of tvs. I did not eat at the bar, and wouldnt because I saw the typical deep fried cheese and chicken strips that are sold at any tavern, ugh...and would probably be charged a premium. I did enjoy being around people who were overall nicely dressed and well behaved, and my bartender was very nice, professional, and well educated."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Disappointing.  I should have been warned by other reviews that this is meant as a pregame bar for the Pens and nothing more.  Staying here for work and hoped for a decent but quick meal after work.  It's hard to mess up a chicken caesar salad, but the lettuce had no dressing and the chicken tasted and looked microwaved.  Told the waitress the salad was \"strange\" and chicken questionable after not eating my dinner and she smiled, took the plate, yet charged me for it.  No sorry, or would I like something else.  $14 for the salad, to be exact, half of which was for the mystery meat.  

Trust me, walk the extra 10 or 15 minutes and get dinner downtown.  There's also way better hotel \"restaurants\" to be had in very close proximity."}
{"text":"Meh. Got a salmon burger and there was too much bun and not enough aioli sauce. Server accommodated with more sauce but not great."}
{"text":"Slightly dated interior design - good friendly service and decent, predictable hotel food."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and all 3 of us got food poisoning! Have been sick for hours with no end in sight! Completely unacceptable. On top of that the service SUCKS. We sat for at least 20 mins before we were even acknowledged and it's expensive. Avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here as a nice dinner.  I ordered fresh scallops and she got a Panini sandwich off the pub menu as the main menu didn't have anything she would consider worth her time.  The food was ok, but not much of it on my plate.  I get they are trying to be a high end restaurant but when you pay $40 for a plate of scallops and get 3 scallops and 5 sprigs of asparagus, not really worth what I paid.  My wife's portion and food was off the charts good.  All she paid was $9.  The waitress was very nice.  Not sure I would go there again."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Marriott and decided to get snack and beer at the bar. I asked about the Honey Ghost Pepper Wings and the server told me they were a local favorite. The wings were tainted and gave me a bad case of food poisoning. I should have looked at some more reviews online before eating here. My experience  with being sick all night and losing a day of work made this trip horrible. Its almost 24 hours since I ate there am still feeling sick. Dont waste your time or risk your helath eating here - Im sure there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"I am a regular guest at the Marriott City Centre and so have got to know the staff here.  They are a great bunch of folks and are particularly good at getting Pens fans adequately ready to go to a home game.  Ethan, even though he knows I am a Ranger fan, has been great to us and I could not think of a better place to go anytime - warm and welcoming atmosphere.  Thanks, Ethan!  Go, Rangers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town for a conference and were tired after a day of travel; so, we decided to eat at the hotel. We both thought the meal was excellent! At first, I questioned the portion size, but after eating decided the chef definitely knew what was going on. I would recommend the food. The price range is what you would expect for hotel dining."}
{"text":"We were seated right away as no one was in the restaurant. It took us over 90 minutes to get our food. They brought everything out wrong. My daughter ordered the pretzel and after 2 hours we had to take it to go because it took so long. No apologies about the wait for food. They did take the pretzel off our bill. Server was slow, didn't bring out dressing for salads after asking numerous times. My husband had to go in the kitchen and ask himself. Food was edible but not great. None of it was warm. Avoid this restaurant if you are in the area. Lots of other great options!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food is pretty good. Whoever is in the kitchen seems to know what they are doing. Can get a bit crowded even when there isn't a hockey game."}
{"text":"Who the hell stops at a Brasserie and Wine Bar before going to an Arena Football game?  Five hungry females who need a meetin' & eatin' place before the game, that's who!  Despite its pretensions to the contrary, this is a glorfied casual hotel bar & grill.  Meaning of course they jack the prices up a little.  

The food here isn't bad, just a little pricey for what you get.  Entrees start at $24.00, sandwiches at $9.00.  They have a special game day menu to get you in-n-out quickly if you're going to an event at the Consol Energy Center.  But the GFs and I were here early enough to order from the regular menu.  I ordered the Marriott Burger which came in at $10.00 with fries.  Thing is, if you want to substitute a small salad like I did, that'll set you back another $3.50.  Places like this really nickel-n-dime you, that's for sure.  

I don't drink, so I can't comment on the wine bar here.  As I said, food's not bad here, just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Was visiting PA for a business trip and stayed at the Marriott downtown. Checked in the hotel around 9:20pm and was recommended to try the restaurant by the concierge. Was greeted very warmly by our server. Ordered their chips and onion dip to start with as appetizers and was pleasantly surprised that the onion dip was one one the best ever. Then ordered the Braised Beed ribs and they were made to perfection. The reduction sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies were simply awesome and hearty. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"salad and pickles were moldy. burger buns were stale. wing sauce wasn't right. these people need to get themselves together!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and was surprised by the reviews.  It's definitely upscale...I felt a little out of place in my sweaty jeans and tee-shirt.  But hey, it was a cool place to come into after the parade.  
The service was great and the staff turned the channel on the tv for us.  My husband had the mushroom truffle burger which he is still raving about 2 weeks later.  I had the cobb salad which was excellent!  The presentation on it was fancy (once again referring to my jeans and tee shirt) but I loved it.  It was a little pricey, but what would you expect from a Marriott restaurant?  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Two stars is a stretch. My wife and I had a gift card for this place so we decided to use it for our anniversary dinner. The only thing good about this place is the service. The menu is very limited and the food is o.k. and it's very pricey. We will never be back. There are too many very good restaurants within walking distance of this place. Go to one of those instead of this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here only before a Penguins game (which has been more than a dozen times) when they have a limited game-day menu and appetizer bar to help get you in and out to your seat by the time Jeff Jimerson is warming up.

The appetizer bar is hit and miss, some things are good, but others are just ok.  There's always a salad option, and they've added a cheese tray which is welcome.  They have pasta available and you can put your choice of sauce on top.  If you want to can just order the app bar, and there is enough there to make a meal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price.

For a place named after salmon, I'd say theirs is only a little better than average.  I've had black cod here a few times (a more recent menu addition) and it's very good.  

As far as wine goes, their selection is really weak considering they are branded as a wine bar.  Also, the prices are not good.  You can do much better elsewhere.

For a nice dinner before a Hockey Night in Pittsburgh, I prefer The Carlton because you get your parking taken care of and the wine selection is much more expansive and better priced."}
{"text":"Bleeeeh.  Desperate to escape from the dinner at my hotel bar yet again, I opted for...dinner at a different hotel bar!  I was lured by \"brasserie\" and \"wine bar\".   If you're following along, you know that I should really know better.  

I learned an interested factedote today--PA liquor laws force restaurants to buy wine at the same price that it retails.   That might explain the wackadoo pricing all over town, and especially at this place.   I'm getting incredibly sick of places that call themselves \"wine bars\" that serve Mark West Pinot Noir, Sterling Merlot and Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay.  Not all of these suck, but not exactly what one looks for in a wine bar.  

The food.  Why call yourself a \"brasserie\" if you're serving average american hotel food?  My \"pan roasted chicken served over fresh pasta\" was a big old bowl of fettucine alfredo with chicken hunks and some artichoke hearts and mushrooms thrown in for flavor.  

The blowhard next to me, talking at me, made me flee with the check as soon as I could."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I had a great lunch at the Steelhead today.  I got the Light & Simple 1/2 Turkey BLT and 1/2 Garden Vegetable Salad meal.  The Turkey BLT was excellent.  The turkey was fresh and plentiful.  The bacon was perfect and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  My 1/2 garden vegetable salad was very good.  The Champagne Vinaigrette dressing was perfect.  I highly recommend trying this place if you are in Downtown Pittsburgh.  The only thing is that they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center Hotel for a wedding. Expecting the usual staid hotel bar, imagine my surprise when I stumbled in there for \"after the other bar\" drinks on the way up to my room and found a bustling bar at 1am. It helps that it's one of the closest bars in proximity to the Penguin's arena, but still, it's a hotel bar that people actually go to. 

Due to the fact that brasserie and wine bar are now tacked on to the name, they think they can charge $9+ for glasses of wine. I'm not so into that b/c it's Pittsburgh. The Stoli and sodas were a more reasonable $6 and some change (compared to the neighborhood place down the street where I could get a Stoli and a beer for $6). Anyway, the crowning glory of the Steelhead was their chicken strips and fries plate that is served late night. The manfriend declared them possibly the best chicken strips he had ever had (see we don't always just eat crudo and cassoulet). More than one plate may have been consumed during the course of the weekend, but what can I say? 

I do hazily recall laughing with some people at the Jackass video on the tv, which was fine with me. It's a very unique mix of P-town locals, hotel guests, and after the game people hanging out. 3.5 stars for a good time."}
{"text":"This was so disappointing. I hadn't been in the restaurant for some time and the last time I was there we had delicious sushi and wine pairings and now they have a $40/pp buffet?!? Two problems with this: 1. This isn't the Grand Concourse brunch and 2. We weren't expecting Golden Corral on Friday night. Lol #gtfo Needless to say, we got up and left. I will not be serving myself (carving station or not) for $40."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in overall quality of a dinner in a hotel of this status. This restaurant should not be allowed to be affiliated with Marriott.
The only meal that has been enjoyable was breakfast."}
{"text":"Ridiculous and also way to expensive, who wants to pay 34 dollars for a cheeseburger?? Or 40 dollars for a buffet? I'm good."}
{"text":"Typically hotel bar - we went in after the Pens game and grabbed a few beers and some food. My friend got the NY Strip steak and fries - the steak was cooked to much and really didn't have any flavor. I had sweet potato fries (which were over fried and burnt) and a wrap. It was okay. Service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"Great job and great service.  I have been coming to the Steelhead for almost a year now and I have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is amazing and the changing menu is always a treat.  You must try the Braised Short Ribs (thankfully, even with the menu changes this dish always persists - I wonder why)!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight because I didn't feel like walking far and beats the horrible Doubletree Bigelow Grill.  They have a limited menu and even more limited when the Penguins are at home. I had a filet mignon steak with mushrooms and fries for $30.  Glad I ordered it medium-rare because it was closer to medium.  Would have expected a baked potato or mashed potatoes.   Had a side order of Broccolini (new to me - it is long stemmed broccoli) for $6 and a bowl of clam chowder for $8 (decent).  They didn't provide any bread which was surprising.  I ended it with white chocolate mousse with orange whipped cream, gingerbread and pistachios. 

If you have a Pittsburgh entertainment book you get 20% off and they also are on the b1G1F card.  

Other items on the menu:  Burger, turkey burger, Chicken sandwich, Salmon, Short ribs, pasta and a few salads/appetizers. They mentioned a buffet before the Penguin games."}
{"text":"Staying @ the Marriott for business, went in for breakfast. Service was average, and pushed for the buffet. Buffet was typical of any big city hotel restaurant, so ordered traditional breakfast, 2 over easy, ham, rye toast. Toast was cool, as was ham, eggs ok. Unimpressed, especially at the typical hotel price point."}
{"text":"You know it really is too bad  this restaurant / bar can't seem to do a better job. So much can be overlooked when you have great customer service. Customer service which is severely lacking in this setting.
This is my second attempt at dining in this establishment and I can't get past having a mediocre cocktail on two separate occasions, delivered by a lackluster bartender who's too busy emptying the dishwasher to attend to the patrons seated at the bar. I believe his name is Ethan. I believe he is the same  person who waited on me four months ago. I gave him a second Shot; fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me....there will not be a third time and it's just too bad because it's a cute cute place...."}
{"text":"We stumbled back to this place to close out the evening a couple times while staying in Pittsburgh, and it was worth stumbling to. The patrons were friendly, there was no shortage of sports on TV, and the beefcake waitress didn't let a single Yuengling get under a quarter-tank before I had a fresh cold one on the way. All that, and the prices weren't too absurd. A fine hotel bar."}
{"text":"The waitress was super slow so much so we abandoned our table and walked up to the bar. The food was medi-ocre and overpriced. The bartender on the other hand was pretty good. I give him 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, slow service and mediocre food at high prices.  Great place to go for a drink.  Great place not to go for anything else."}
{"text":"We stopped here before a 1:00 Saturday Pens game.  Almost every table was filled with Pens fans. Friendly service, draft beer specials and an above average kitchen for a hotel bar.  Why pay out the wazoo for run of the mill stadium food and beer in the Console Center when you can have a good sit down lunch and drinks for a lot less right across the street?"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times while we stayed at the marriott city center.  Food was good, had late lunch and breakfast so far. Staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Just ate there before a Pens game. It was just ok all around. The food was ok. The price was ok. The service was meh. However, I did notice our server merely sweep off a table to reset it for the next guests...so gross. Wipe it down, bro."}
{"text":"Came to town on business and decided to eat at the hotel. Was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the roasted chicken. Staff were very accommodating and let us switch it out veggies. The crazy carrots were outstanding! My steak was cooked perfectly; my husband loved the parsnip puree. It wasn't hard to be part of the clean plate club and the portions were perfect. The chef clearly knew what he was doing. The waitstaff were very attentive and everything was reasonably priced. Best food we had in Pittsburgh!"}
