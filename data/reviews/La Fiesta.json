{"text":"Just delicious food! And the service was very warm and friendly! Go!"}
{"text":"love this place authentic Mexican..the tortillas are amazing, green chili is always tasty, they are very nice, and always willing to help me with the menu"}
{"text":"Food is okay but their customer service is the worse.  Went there several months ago and the soup I ordered was cold.  I told the cashier and he just ignored me.  We went back today order some menuedo and it was never brought to us.  I finally went and asked the cashier,  she looked around found our ticket on the serving table. She then says that they had run out...but yet no one had let us know,. We whould still be waiting if I hadn't gone to ask for our food. What did they care they already had the $$. Never apologized... Service there is a joke. You'd think she'd comp the drinks for their short comings,  no, she didn't, she made sure she charged us for the drinks. Send your staff to some customer service classes. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant... I prefer to drive to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Finally, great place for Mexican food in Buckeye. I have tried the green chili, red chili, posole, tamales, chicken burrito and everything was great. The service & attitude was great. When you travel through Buckeye it's on the south side of Hwy 85 just west of Baseline Rd."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat in Buckeye!   The best thing to order is the carne asada taco's!!!  My husband orders the green chili combo plate, which is highly recommended too! The food is always fresh and they make their own tortilla's also. The people are always friendly!!  Please try this out because, you won't regret it and I don't want a good thing in Buckeye to go away because of lack of business!"}
{"text":"Came for Taco Tuesday unfortunately only Al pastor and Pollo Asado are included in the .99 cent special but you won't be disappointed they are really good. Also had the usually carne asada tacos for 1.79 which isn't bad compared to other places. Salsa bar has variety this is always a plus for me as I like all types of chile for my tacos. They also have pan dulce and other snacks like fruit cups, corn in cup, etc. haven't really checked out that section."}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant.  First time there.  Excellent food and service.  Best Restaurant in Buckeye by far.  This will be our restaurant of choice in the area.  Love the decor, salsa bar and unusual choices on the menu.  Well done!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch. We wanted authentic Mexican food. We had a hard time reading the menu so we ordered a Chumi. It was delicious. The bakery food we purchased was also very good. The prices were reasonable also. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked the look of this place from the road- brightly colored, older looking hacienda style like you'd see in a neighborhood in Jalisco. I felt like I'd have to step over la borrachon en el sombrero e poncho to get inside.  Not too long ago in Rosarita, El Borrachon would have been me.  I ordered tacos- dos de lengua e dos al pastor, (tongue and pork.) $3 each.  Horchata, (sweet rice drink pronounced or- cha- ta.) $2. Chips and salsa, free.  I ordered in Spanish too.  That's always fun for me.  I'm a big, fat white guy that looks like Jim Gaffigan and learned Spanish from watching \"Three Amigos\" over and over.  You can't mess up tongue tacos.  No trick there.  They were good.  The al pastor was good as well but I believe the pork was sautéed and not roasted.  This makes a difference.  Roasting is time consuming and more costly- but it is sooo worth it. The chips were fresh made and ok.  I wasn't crazy about the selection of tortillas.  The salsa was not very good- very watery, not hot, not much flavor.  I prefer a Sonoran style sauce that's the consistency of what people in the States use as hot sauce.  Most Mexican restaurants in the  States make a chunky salsa that's half salsa and half pico.  This place seemed to be trying to \"Americanize\" their salsa by making it half salsa half pico.  They had more traditional salsas in squeeze bottles though.  They should have just served them instead- they were good.  Bottom line is the food was pretty good.  I'd eat there again.  I do wish they had a \"help yourself\" salsa bar though, wth all the good stuff like cut radishes, roasted jalapeños, cilantro and onion.  Upside down Margarita service would be nice too.  There's nothing like being force fed margaritas one ingredient at a time."}
{"text":"Nice little spot located in a small plaza in Buckeye. A one stop shop for Mexican pastries, tortillas, homemade tortillas chips, raspados, menudo and so much more. I can't believe I didn't know this place existed before now. The menudo was delicious hot and fresh and the huevos ranchero breakfast entree was delicious as well as Garnished nicely with slicedavocado and cabbage. There's a nice bar with a selection of chilis, cucumbers and limes. Great location when you don't want to drive into the city for good Mexican food. I can't wait to try the packet of tortillas I bought. Definitely recommend to stop in and try."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Had the carne asada burrito and it was so gooooood! The chips and salsa were very tasty too! Guacamole was some of the best I e had in a while! I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Mexican restaurant I've to in years. Every time I go in they know me  and remember what I like. Prices are great,food portions are nice size. I would recommend them to everyone I know. The homemade horchatas are delicious. I usually get either a chimiganga (birria meat) or there small tacos. One more item is the tamales can't go wrong if you eat there."}
{"text":"This is the Mexican restaurant that cleveland deserves! The al pastor and pescado tacos were fantastic! I've been waiting for a classic taqueria, with corn tortillas and horchata to open in the city for ever and La Fiesta has delivered on my hopes and dreams. Also, the staff was very nice and attentive. No alcohol is the only down side but maybe someday!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Buckeye. When I crave for comfort Mexican food, I dine here. The restaurant sells pan dulce, homemade tortillas, raspados and authentic Mexican food. It's a one stop place for Mexican food and delights.   So far, I tried the caldo de res and pozole. For the flavor and serving size the pozole wins! If you decide to eat here, come in a empty stomach because you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This review is for the prices and menu changes.  As a faithful customer, I was pretty confused as to why I was charged differently on my receipt for a chile relleno plate when on the menu it stated $6.00 but I was charged $7.99. We quickly asked about the charge and was told that we're charged whatever the cash register charges. ?  The girl (who was nice) called the owner and he said that the menu would be changed in the following week to match the prices on the register. No refund. I think we should have been charged what was advertised and obviously he owner didn't care. $2 is a HUGE difference! Bad business practice."}
{"text":"I look forward to eating here when I'm in Buckeye every couple of weeks.  The Pastor tacos are $1.00 on Tuesday and Wednesday, and they are really, really good and are filled with a bunch of tasty meat.  Also, many fresh salsas to choose from.  They have a nice assortment of Pan Dulces for a great way to finish off a meal.  Best of all its run by a super nice, very friendly family."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Mexican food. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The Al Pastor (marinated pork) and Pescado (fish) tacos are my go to."}
{"text":"We recently catered from here this past weekend , and everything came out amazing . Everyone loved the food ! And was supper cheap ! Definitely will be eating again here !"}
{"text":"We catered a high school graduation party may 28th 2017. The food was amazing. Everybody raved about how good it was. Carlo was the nicest young man. He brought everything we needed to eat and set up and cleaned up. I would recommend them for any event. Very very affordable. We could not be happier."}
{"text":"This my favorite restaurant for traditional Mexican food. You can pick anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very authentic!  My husband said his chile relleno was the best."}
{"text":"Awful. Food was bland and expensive. Didn't have what I ordered, made me change AFTER I had paid, refused to honor verizon rewards coupon. Brought us the wrong order right off the bat, salsas were also flavorless. Avoid this place. There's 3 other mexican food restraunts in the area that blow this place out of the water, especially for the price."}
{"text":"THE restaurant in Cleveland that brings me back to the traditional Mexican food I grew up with in So Cal - the little family owned joints where the plates were full and the food was spicy and delicious, and nothing was \"trendy\". The ambiance here is informal, festive and inviting, with comfortable seating and atmosphere.  The food here is always great, authentic and sincere, and the service is superior.  The Margaritas are particularly good, and ample. Shredded beef tacos, chili rellenos, tacos al pastore, all fantastic.  The salsa is spiced for \"average Clevelanders\", but add a little habanero sauce to the basic salsa and you can get the heat you want."}
{"text":"Super authentic real deal Mexican food.  I really enjoyed the lunch buffet as well as the atmosphere.   I loved the carne asada and al pastor so much i ate it twice last week. best taco's in the west valley."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Was searching for an authentic Mexican restaurant and La Fiesta did not disappoint. Ordered sopes and a chile relleno and they were super yummy"}
{"text":"First time trying them and the food itself was ok. They did mess up part of my order; I called them and was told to bring in the burrito so they could replace it with the correct order. I show up and they decided not to replace my order but put in what was missing. Lady was a little rude and defensive. Needless to say we'll still be looking for  a new mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place, tacos were really good...ceviche was on point...the birria was really good....salsa bar was perfect...great place in the middle of nowhere..."}
{"text":"We live near this establishment. Great al pastor tacos. With lots of room for a large family to eat.  Tues and Wednesday are 99cent tacos al pastor and chicken...."}
{"text":"They catered my husband's company Christmas party at our house. Very friendly staff. Tons of delicious food. They even left the leftovers for us! Food was great! We had street tacos and fresh, homemade tamales. They made the street tacos to order. Homemade salsa was amazing!! Can't speak for the restaurant as I've not been in there. But if the food is as tasty as the taco truck catering, you're missing out if you don't try it! Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's great. I like the authentic food, the atmosphere is as if I was in Mexico, and my Spanish is laughed at as if I was in Mexico. Bottom line: pretty authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in for a warm and inviting delicious lunch today. Food was over the top fantastic, every bite a taste sensation. We did tacos & tostadas- fish was was light but flavorful, marinated grilled chicken was moist and tasty, but the winner hands down was the pork marinated meat - \"Al Pastor\" DELICIOUS!  Horchata was also very tasty along with their 3 home made salsas & the marinated veggies. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this place and I will have to say that the carne asada is my new favorite. It is a bit greasy but has amazing grilled flavor and is nice and tender. I tried one regular carne asade taco, a asada burro, and a pork tamale. My wife had two carne asada grande tacos and a beef tamale. This was also my first time ever eating a tamale and it was a bit sweet for both my wife and I and she grew up eating tamales so I would have to trust her judgment on that! The burro was crammed full of meat which is something I have almost never seen at other places, because it's usually just filler with a few pieces of meat, so that was amazing!   We also ordered a regular size horchata  for my wife and a large fountain drink for me. All of this ended up being just under $20 for the two of us so this place is really reasonable.   The decor is pretty basic (which I don't care about) but if you care about ambiance, just focus on the delicious food instead. Chips and salsa were complimentary which was nice. The green tomatillo sauces were pretty standard and didn't really have much flavor and the other red salsas were pretty spicy so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to heat, but I enjoyed them nonetheless!  - 1 star because the restrooms needed some attention with the floors and empty soap dipensers, while the place does have a sign in the main plaza sign list it really needs a better one above the front door instead of the vinyl banner that blew up and over the roof, and finally refills for drinks are A DOLLAR per refill! This was a big turn off for me since (if you do some research) the average cost of a 20oz fountain drink is about $0.22-0.25 if you add up the cost of the syrup, water, ice, cup, lid, and straw. So with a large drink costing $2.50 here, I could get eight refills using new cups, lids, straws, etc., and they would still make a profit! I'd say either make the refill cost MUCH less or get smaller cups, charge a bit less for them, and then have free refills. That is really the only thing that truly bothered me about this place.  Overall, this place was great for our first time visit! The food tasted fresh and cooked to order and the cashier was friendly. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada I have ever tasted. Great tortillas! Make it a point to eat here. This is anything but another Fili bS knock off"}
{"text":"The food is very authentic and reasonably priced.  I had the steak Burro and the steak meat was excellent, one of the tastiest I've ever had.  My wife had a chicken taco, lots of meat and delicious, along with a pork tamale and rice and beans. Everything was excellent and you can't beat the prices... service with a smile. Don't forget the champurrado on the way out, once again, one of the better ones we have ever had, yum! Worth the short trip from Surprise, we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent, perfect authentic Mexican food. Very reasonable prices ....clean place to eat."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. They have the best Mexican Food Buffet during the week. And tamales year round !!!"}
{"text":"9/10 best Mexican food in buckeye!  Super authentic tasting and we go at least once a week. Only downside is the prices are a little high for simple thing but I guess that's how they make their money!   The food is way worth it and they also have elotes and other super good treats!  Stop by you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is authentic Mexican.  The place is tucked into a little shopping mall beside the Sonic in Historic Old Buckeye.  The directions on Yelp take you to an empty lot off AZ85 and Baseline.   Type in the address with 7770 County Road 85 and it will get you there.  Worth the search."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Excellent food for decent prices, although over the last year they did jack up the prices by a dollar or two.  The chili verde here is off the charts.  I have never gotten a bad batch.....  The salsa bar is great too, with the cabbage being nice in particular, to have.  The buffet is OK but getting the above-mentioned plate is certainly filling, and a bit cheaper.  The address listed is incorrect, it is 7707 SW Hwy 85 (no US in there).  It is in that small shopping center that has a pawn shop at the end."}
{"text":"They catered my grandson's graduation party in Gilbert and the food was outstanding.  Everyone raved about the fresh tacos.  High school kids are hard to impress, but La Fiesta got high-fives from everyone.  Thanks again for making the party a success!"}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, Yes!!! I always get excited when I try new places that from first glance look nondescript but when you get inside the food is amazing and this place is no exception. I had a strong craving for some tacos and rice and beans so we decided to check this place out. I wanted to order everything on the menu but we decided on some queso and chips, chicken and two pork tacos with rice and beans for me, and fajitas for my boyfriend. The restaurant smelled wonderful and we couldn't wait to dig in to our food. The salsa had a smoky taste to it and the queso was on the thin side but warm and flavorful. They brought out two sauces for our food. One was green and mild and the other red and spicy. My tacos were simple but good and my boyfriends fajitas were pretty basic but good as well. I don't know why people need to overcomplicate the taco nowadays. Simple ingredients and great flavor are all you need. The star of the show however was the refried beans. Strange I know however these tasted homemade and had an amazing flavor to them that I don't even know how to describe. I would go back there just to have these refried beans again. I can't wait to go back and try all their other food options next time!"}
{"text":"These are our favorite tacos in Cleveland! Use both red and green salsas for extra flavor and heat.  Friendly staff, homey feel, consistent quality. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy, as food is prepared when ordered (and takes some time, be patient)."}
{"text":"What a great find! We had carne asada tacos, cheese enchiladas, and super nachos. There is a bakery and they actually bake on site. Clean, tasty, very reasonably priced."}
