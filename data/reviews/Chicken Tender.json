{"text":"Excellent little spot that you would never guess has great sushi. And the price can't be beat either! Would definitely go back if I was in the area again...dont be fooled by the outside appearance and name, this place makes a mean sushi roll."}
{"text":"The owner is so incredibly sweet - you can tell she truly cares about her customer's satisfaction. Good food, fast service and great prices. To anyone in the area, I would definitely recommend checking it out. Much better than going to superstore or metro for a sushi craving."}
{"text":"The name is misleading, I agree. The food however is delicious! 

You can order from a variety of items, sushi, fried chicken, or even Chinese! They're only about half a year old & recently offer delivery on Just-Eat.ca! I definitely recommend the fried chicken and the 3 rolls special for $9.99! Skip the wonton soup though."}
{"text":"Nothing special.

Ordered F7 - $7.49 (with drink);
5 chicken wings - $4 something;
House special fried rice - $7.49.

Fried chicken ARE not comparable to KFC nor Popeyes.

MSG overload on the fried rice.

Prices are not reasonable; quite expensive.

Somebody ordered 5 nuggets, it was $4.99 without any fries or drink.

Fried rice/chicken taste was very homemade (oily too)
(meaning, anyone above 12 years old can make them).

4C Broaster Chicken on Lawrence & Victoria Park is worth a visit than this one!
$3.29 buys you a combo already (2 chicken/fries/drink)"}
