{"text":"I've been waiting for more healthy options in Chandler and Peckish prep is a great start to fill that void. Although the menu is small it has a decent variety of ingredients and flavors. Both owners, who are very friendly, were there when I went in. The chef said they were rolling out a new fall menu soon with more options at a lower price point. I ordered the braised beef that comes with a side salad to go. It was fun to watch the chef cook while I waited. You could see the care he puts into his food. The salad was extremely flavorful and had a spicy kick to it. The beef was perfectly tender with no fat and the potatoes were creamy. They were out of a few things so I couldn't try the dessert...but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything we had was fresh and exploding with flavor. Chef Rauson and Ebony are delightful and welcoming, definitely will be coming back."}

{"text":"Stopped in with the wife and had a great time. Good food and good Convo with the owners. Don't get bent out of shape over the photos. Butter squash soup (no picture) gone before I realize I didn't take a pic. Spaghetti and veggie dish (about halfway through I realized I hadn't taken a picture again). Ok so when the stirfry came I got the pic before I dug in same fore the brownie. With all that said there are words on the walls and the pic of \"goodness\" says it all. Stop in and get some goodness. Peace."}
