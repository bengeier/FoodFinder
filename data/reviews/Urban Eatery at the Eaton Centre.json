{"text":"Lots of choices to suit everyone's cravings! From Mcdonalds to Aroma, Indian, Japanese cuisine, etc. Lots to choose from. It gets busy during lunch hour, but if you manage to arrive just before noon, it never takes more than a few minutes to find a table."}
{"text":"The Urban Eatery is epic compared to what it used to be.  My favourite place is Aroma and their little seating area. But there are a ton of choices for food and even a vegan/veggie place.  Perfect place to grab something quick or to kill some time downtown. It's pretty clean too for such a big food court! You can wash your hands at the hand washing station."}
{"text":"Especially during the winter when I stick around after work to do a bit of shopping, Urban Eatery is the best place to grab dinner. There is a great variety. Greek, Thai, Szechuan, Shanghai, Japanese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, and the usual fast foods - McDonald's, New York Fries, KFC, and the list goes on.   It can get pretty busy even during weeknights and it can be a little difficult to find a table. Sometimes, the tables are not cleaned right away as well.   I do find this food court is a bit more pricey than others. Considering it is a food court, I spent $25 last night simply on a stromboli, a very small bowl of salad, a poutine and two small drinks - it hardly fed two people.  I don't mind paying the price for clean shiny tables and chairs, to have the variety and the convenience, but it's not a place I would eat at and pay for every single time I'm at Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"A coworker got very sick (food poisoning) after eating at one of the Chinese take outs there.  It makes me afraid of trying the Chinese food there!"}
{"text":"When your eyes roll to the back of your head because your tastebuds have hit the limits of a heavenly lunch you never thought possible in a mall food court, you know you've found a \"go to\" lunch spot. Urban Herbivore made my urban heart flutter.  First, the option of an uber healthy lunch (and knowing that one of these existed in Kensington Market) was what captured my attention and got me to stand in line (a short one at that). Secondly, the fresh, colourful display of ingredients behind squeaky clean glass is what drew me in closer.  I scanned the menu and was really in the mood for something disgustingly healthy. Grain Bowl? Intriguing. You choose a base, brown rice or quinoa and lentils! Sold. Hook me up. WhaT?! I get SIX ingredients to add to it! This was my first grain bowl experience/ingredient pick: Quinoa & Lentil base, dill cucumbers, cooked beets, roasted red peppers, kidney bean salad, marinated red cabbage and HALF an avocado. Not a teaspoon or avocado with filler...I said HALF of a beautiful, pastel green, creamy, ripe avocado. And why yes, I'd love some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. Citrus Herb dressing please (light on the quantity).  At $9.50 it's pretty standard for downtown lunching (or anywhere in the city for that matter). BUT, you could totally split it with someone or divvy it up and eat it over two days. I loved the customer service. I loved the food. And I will be back and telling everyone about it.  Awesome job Urban Herbivore."}
{"text":"We hit up Eaton Centre today for a few bits and pieces, not realising that the new food court- sorry, Urban Eatery, was open for business. Everything down there looks swanky, but a closer look reveals the usual suspects that you'll recognise from the old hell hole this mall called a food court. You've got your Sbarro and Thai Express, along with Subway, McDonalds and New York Fries. That said, there are a couple of shiny, new places and a Big Smoke Burger kiosk is one of them. Hurray!!  We did a walk-by earlier in the afternoon and noticed that Big Smoke had a line (probably about 10 people). This seemed consistent as it was still there when we returned at around 4pm. The menu and pricing are the same as the other locations as far as I can tell, but the staff are the what make this a three star place instead of a four-star (like the Yorkville location). When I ate at the Yorkville location, the staff all seemed to be of a certain ... genre? Sort of hip, cool, older 20-somethings working at a gourmet burger joint. Over at Eaton Centre, you've got your usual food court worker types. They move the line along efficiently (there does seem to be a lot of people squeezed behind there!) but they're a lot younger and it seems like many of them aren't used to working the job. The kid that took my order was unsure of himself and whether or not it was his fault, the person making my burger in turn screwed up my burger. Again, I don't know was this because he managed to not put my order in right (we did go over it twice!) or because the person assembling it was distracted/busy/whatever. Either way, It wasn't a huge deal. I just went back to the counter and asked them to throw on the forgotten stuff, which they did with no questions asked (nice, considering they don't give receipts and I would have no way of proving I paid for the extras!).  My boyfriend's burger was a little over-done, but he likes it that way, apparently. He said it wasn't quite as good as the Yorkville location, but for a food court, it was pretty amazing. I decided to do something wild and not have meat. I got the veggie burger with roasted red peppers, cheddar, caramelized onions, and a few of the more generic burger toppings. I thought the lack of meat would help me avoid getting pregnant with yet another meat baby courtesy of Toronto's many gourmet burger shacks. Sadly no. Congratulations, it's a faux-meat baby! Handily enough (TMI-a-phobes, feel free to skip this next bit), the whole-wheat bun did it's job. The onion rings were as good as any other Big Smoke. Lightly breaded, not too oily, and therefore not too heavy. Didn't get a chance to try the fries (or, saints forbid, the poutine!).  All in all, a solid burger place, ace for a food court, but not quite up to the usual Big Smoke standard as far as staff/service is concerned. I'm going to chalk this up to the place only being open a week and a half (I know, I'm so understanding and generous). I'll go back in a few weeks and see how they're doing. If they grease up the cogs, I see no reason they couldn't be a four-star place. Whatever happens, they'll always be busy because they share a space with Subway and McDonalds type places."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. One of us had a chicken ceased from Bourbon street. It was ok for food court food and with a drink just under ten bucks. My companion had a combo from Ruby Thai - where do I start?  Ordered a two choice combo and asked for veggies and curry to go.  The woman behind the counter said you have to have rice uh ok assuming that the curry would go on top. Nope when we opened up the container it was half a container of rice with a spoonful of veg. Went back to complain and show them they said no you had the two combo and you have two. Uh ok but asked for curry. Also there was no fork in the bag. Tasteless overpriced meal with a springroll that was greasy inedible and cost 12 bucks with a drink. Horrible rude service would never eat there again.   Bottom line beautiful shiny packaging concealing crappy food court food."}
{"text":"Ate at Szechuan Express. The food was generally well prepared but the bao were terrible and everything was cold even though they were quite busy. The staff were even colder than the food; I felt like I was on an assembly line being passed from person to person. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The new Eaton Centre food court is a definite improvement over the old one by Queen Street.  There is much more seating, and it is laid out in a much more efficient way.  While I didn't see what the food court looked like previously, it had wonderful decor, and real plates, cutlery and glasses (which I found weird to be eating off of in a mall food court)  There are many food choices, some were from the old food court and some are new (including a place selling vegan food) and of course KFC and McD's, but the latter 2 are the nicest ones that I have ever seen!  I hope I will be coming back soon to try something new!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to the food court while in the Eaton Centre and was brought here.  WOW!  A clean, new modern food court with a very diverse selection of fast food from around the world as well as a sushi restaurant that offers take out!  This place doesn't feel as cramped as the other food court, doesn't feel as tacky and there is a lot more space and lighting.  I heard the washrooms here were clean too.  Dear Eaton Centre riff raff, please don't run this place into the ground!"}
{"text":"Shock and awe - the Eaton's Centre Urban Eatery is what all food court malls should look like. Upon descending the escalator, I was taken back as to how clean, bright and shiny the revamped food court area was. There is ample seating everywhere, from bar stool seating to picnic tables.   Any type of cuisine, there is a food court chain available for your dining tastes. I had Ruby Thai when I visited this past weekend, my meal + drink was $9.50. Not a bad price considering you are in the core of downtown Toronto.   I love the fact they give you plates and actual cutlery if you are dining in. The environment spin will help the carbon foot print to the food court operation.   Definitely coming back to try out the other food court choices! They even have Big Smoke Burgers!"}
{"text":"Go to Szechuan Express.  Just make sure what you get is fresh.  I always look for what's fresh before ordering.  Ruby Thai and A&W would be my second choices.  If you want salad and protein - maybe consider Jimmy The Greek.  I tried the Big Smoke across from Toronto Metro Library and it was good.  I never tried the one at Eaton Centre, but that might be a good choice too.  I hate the KFC here.  It's never fresh.  For visitors, the Urban Eatery is basically a food court."}
{"text":"The 3-star rating is attributed to the fact that, well, it's a food court. By that standard, it has succeeded in setting the bar fairly high. There's some impressive Toronto natives like Liberty Noodle, Urban Herbivore, and Amaya. In addition to a few newbies worth mentioning (Fast Fresh and Rare). Still, the polished decor doesn't quite mask that you are eating off a tray."}
{"text":"Having been to their Oxford Street location, I was excited to visit their Eaton Centre location and I wasn't disappointed..........well maybe  a little.  I am a big fan of their simplistic,no-jazz menu, however,having gone gluten-free since my previous visit I was unable to sample the baked goods.  I got the soup of the day - Spicy Tomato soup-and it certainly hit the spot! Nice chunky pieces of tomato and beans, with just the right amount of spice, made this a perfect little meal on a cold wintry evening. I also got the red lemonade which was very refreshing  and provided me with much needed hydration after my long day of work  The cashier was a bit snobby, not just with me but with the other customers too, I noticed. She had no clue about the gift coupons I had either but, thankfully, was promptly assisted by one of the nicer, friendlier kitchen staff.  I will definitely go back to this UH location but more so for the fresh veggie fare and not so much for the service....."}
{"text":"As far as food courts go, the Urban Eatery is as good as it gets.  The good: - real cutlery and plates - lots of choices - renovated and modern look  The bad: - crowded during weekday lunch and can be hard to find a seat - underground so no natural light coming in - can be messy when people don't take their trash to a cleaning zone  All in all it's nice to see food courts becoming more upscale"}
{"text":"Eating at urban eatery is like going to hell and being forced to each garbage."}
{"text":"When I heard the food court in the basement was getting renovated, I was enticed to see what it looks like because the last food court was quite creepy-looking and I barely go there or forgot about it when I go to Eaton Centre. Recently, this week I had a chance to go to Eaton Centre and see what the new food court looks like.  What I saw blew my mind, the food court now has the entire floor to themselves and updated their decor and fast food restaurants into this century. I feel that everything looks like an Apple product; it's clean, posh  sharp-looking and white.. that's what she said. From Star Trek-looking chairs to sleet style tables, I gotta give the designer credit for making this place look sharp especially when I didn't even notice McDonalds and Sbarro until I saw their names.   Anyways, the fast food places had also changed and had brought plenty other fast food, whether ethnic or not into this floor.  I was first tempted to go to the sushi restaurant but I ended up ordering at Mucho Burritos because I never had a burrito that isn't Taco Bell or Frozen.   The hospitality is somewhat friendly, the person behind the counter spoke quietly so I didn't hear for abit.  Nevertheless I ordered a mild steak burrito and a mandarin juice bottle that equals to 12 dollars which was expensive. The burrito itself was really warm when I ate it, it felt like they didn't heat it too much. They also added more rice than the steak and beans which doesn't matter to me but dude, it's like 7-8 dollars for this burrito? For the mandarin juice in a bottle, it's alright but I had drink better ones."}
{"text":"This place is a mess.  Consistently every time I come here I want to leave as fast as I can.  There's nothing healthy here and you'll be lucky to even get a lunch here for less than $11-12 which is quite alot considering the garbage and lack of care you get.  I've been here so many times, but never coming back.  I won't get into specifics as to what fast food chains failed and how because it's not worth it.  All you need to know is that the food here is overpriced, unhealthy, and the service is mostly apathetic. That, and your eating in an environment that is extremely noisy and not relaxing at all.  Yeah I get it.  It's a food court and that's what you'd expect from a food court, and as such it gets a 1 star.  I feel bad for people visiting Toronto, or are new to the city that don't realize how many great options they have around Yonge/Dundas that are more affordable and less garbagy than the Urban Eatery.  I will give it credit in that it's alot cleaner and the renovations done on this place are nothing short of astounding.  But to me, that isn't enough to warrant me spending that much money on junk.  I really just dislike this place!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is really looking good! A very much improved food court in the Eaton Centre from the previous area. Everything is clean and sleek looking, lots of seating too. Yes, of course it's just a bunch of fast food places all jammed in one area, but there is a good variety of food offered and the atmosphere is much better.  Best improvement? Hand washing station!! Yes!!! I've been touching random things in stores and handling money and debit machines for the past few hours, then washing my hands before i eat is probably a good idea. Its all touchless too. Hurrah!"}
{"text":"It's like Alice's Restaurant \"You can get anything you want...\" McDonalds, Aroma coffee, Tonkatsu Ramen at Liberty Noodle, Quesedillas from Mucho Burrito, Butter Chicken at Amaya, Steak sandwich at Rare, Gelato, Pad Thai, Sushi... is there ANYTHING that isn't available here?  Manners.  Despite several signs on each table asking patrons to take their trays to the various stations when finished, people still don't. You don't even have to dump your own stuff in the garbage as each station has someone working there who keeps the area clean and sanitary. All you have to do is be considerate so the next person doesn't have to look at and/or pick up your garbage, and the people working the stations don't have to leave their post to clean up the mess you made. It's just common sense and basic manners. It saddens me to see how many lazy people still don't possess either of these virtues."}
{"text":"The greek restaurant w blue logo is a good chioce if u look for fresh food with salad."}
{"text":"Review for Teriyaki Express!  The staff on a weekday afternoon (around 4 pm) was very slow for some reason. :( I was one of 2 customers. My order took an unusually long time, and was incorrect which given the lack of customers at the time, didn't make sense to me.    Teriyaki Express usually varies greatly with which staff member is making the dish, so the taste of the food itself isn't always guaranteed.  I usually love the tofu options that they have, and the fact that Teriyaki Express is quite frequently found in food courts around the GTA."}
{"text":"I checked out this food court for the first time today. Wow, the food court is bigger than some malls. I was fasting so didn't eat anything but definitely scoped out some good contenders."}
{"text":"Easily the best looking food court in the city. Even chain vendors have got a fancy theme make over, the McDonalds look like it should be in some sort of future spaceport and with the addition of urban herbivores and aroma coffee the circle is now complete, I can get a great (little pricey) lunch, have a decent cup of coffee or help myself to delicious gelato (in the middle of the court next to crepe place) and get the coffee to go. That's a complete meal to me however way you look at it.  Everything is new so it's very clean looking, and people can now genuinely look forward to eating at the mall. I have yet to try out the sandwich shop \"rare\" and a couple of other places that look really good. A slight miss for me was trying the falafel crepe, but I'm not a big fan of savoury crepes anwyays.  Seating is abundant and I highly recommend you to brave Yonge and Dundas square for a meal here. I can hardly wait to see what they have in store for us at the south food court when it opens up."}
{"text":"Like the the urban eatary as it'd plenty of choice  Szechaun express was always a particular favorite but after last experience I will never eat there again because of how I was treated two ladies were rude unhelpful and bluntly igornant"}
{"text":"For McDonald's!  Being a university student, yes, I will eat at fast food places. And since my university is in the middle of the Downtown core, fast food is everywhereeeeeeeeeeee! Though unhealthy, it is super convenient to eat during my 1 hour break between classes.  My favourite cashier here is Diana and she's always on the far right side when you enter this McDonald's in the morning! Her attitude with her regular customers is real because she's so down to earth and she has a couple of regulars whom she knows their orders and they also come and chat with her briefly in the morning which I love. The other cashiers aren't as friendly as her when it came to customer service - she recognizes which customer gets what as sometimes she'll look at that specific customer and personally hand them their coffee, and to also check on orders when they are just standing on the side :) . Which is why I always line up to order from her whenever I see her in the store.  Now for McDonald's new \"Sausage and Hashbrown More-Ning McWrap\"! Clearly, I saw the commercial and thought \"wow, it's like a Sausage Egg McMuffin but in a burrito!\", even though the egg was scrambled instead of sunny side up.  Anyways I decided to try it yesterday since I was slightly early for class, heehee. Besides the \"Sausage and Hashbrown McWrap\", a \"Kale and Feta McWrap\" is also available!  As you can see, the McWrap is super huge!!! I believe it's around $4(?) without the combo.  I never even had a regular McWrap before, so I was shocked that the McWrap was so bloody huge!! I was thinking it'd be more of the size like the Breakfast Burritos they have...  When you first open it, you can't see much as to what is being put into the burrito... so I took a few bites and took a mid-way picture for you guys to see.  As you can see, they really stuffed the burrito with a lot of eggs, so the majority I felt like I was eating were the eggs - I mean, at least I'm getting more bang for my buck. I usually like to pepper my eggs, so maybe I'll do that next time I eat this.  The tortilla was soft and chewy. The hashbrown taste were really distinctive every bite, however I can't say the same for the sausage. At the end of the burrito, I found more sausage bits there but per bite as I ate my McWrap, I felt like it needed more sausage.  It was SUPER filling and I didn't eat till dinner time which was about 6PM ish.. and I had a full load of classes today so that McWrap was a good decision! :) . I'd totally suggest to grab this if you're having a long day and won't have time to eat inbetween."}
{"text":"Wow, let's welcome the Eaton Centre to the 21'st century. It's about time their food court got an update like this, and this should be the standard for all mall food courts.   Although, overwhelming at first, especially if you remember what it used to look like, it then becomes a comfortable place to have a meal. You actually want to have a meal here.   It's not just the decor, albeit, it is very appealing to go to a fancy KFC and Mcdonald's, but I wonder how long they will last because of the other variety you can get here. Mediterranean Food, Greek Food, Thai Food, Chinese, Japanese (sushi restaurant and Teriyaki), Gourmet Burgers (from Craft Burger), Crepes, Vegetarian (Urban Herbavore), Ramen (Liberty Noodle), Italian (sbarro)  It's especially great because it's not just fast food. And if you want to spend the money, you have the option!  Not only that, the decor is modern, functional and is actually comfortable. If you're eating in, you get actual plates and glasses; when you're done, you take them to a washing station where there are people actually there washing.  There are hand washing stations scattered in nooks as well.   I really hope for the success of this, but it can only be done with the help of patrons doing their part, not making a mess, and if the workers are diligent enough to clean up after jerks. I would hate to come here a few months from now, and it to look like a mess.   Kudos to Dialogue 38 for excellent design and innovation.   The best part of this food court, is that it's hidden away from the rest of the mall. Underneath it all, and no need for shoppers who aren't hungry to have to walk through all of this.  But why does the Sportchek seem to need to follow the food court everywhere?"}
{"text":"Good Bye the days of Styrofoam! Hello to the 21st century, modern food court. With it's nice glass etched signs, wooden chairs and tables, real plates, trays and utensils, this food court is a more upscale experience right from the start.  The variety of restaurants here are plenty. To my surprise, even Amaya Indian cuisine and Smokes Burgers was amongst the group. Now I don't have to travel too far to have a taste of both.   What I liked most about the Urban Eatery was the size and space of the court and its cleanliness. It's wide and spacious with adequate seating (although when I visited, I waited 3 mins for a seat) . They substituted do-it-yourself garbage bins with these counters. I felt bad handing in my tray of garbage to a bartender-looking attendant at the disposal counter, it was sort of degrading to see them stack and polish trays that tweens have left them.   Overall, the selection, quality and experience have all exceeded my expectations of a food court.    Good Bye Styrofoam, hello 21st century."}
{"text":"Aside from the occasional shooting, this place is actually awesome.  Hands down, it's my favourite mall food court in ... the world. (And I'm from Dubai...where malls are magical)  It's really great that the Eaton Centre decided to do this, and I think it's really food for Toronto!  Have a seat, use some for real real utensils, drink pop out of a glass...  THe food selection is typical, with a bit of fancier options than just your standard McDonalds/Bourbon St Grill and whatever. They have an Indian place, that dim sum area...its cool."}
{"text":"It's ok for a fast food joint but lacking in value  In Tokyo the salaryman can sit down and enjoy a 1 coin ramen (500 yen coin or about $5) anywhere and be served a full chicken breast with udon noodles and veggies  In toronto you pay double and skim through the cabbage to find chicken that is shredded and wonder if you got the vegan bowl by mistake  I worked in a kitchen before and that is a sign of skimping  The chicken chili sauce is brimming of flavor and the noodles are just right but Hmmm mm where is the chicken? The dish is so good that the let down is in the protein element.  Take pride in what you do and be a bit  more generous in your servings  This a perfect example of how a great idea executes poorly to those in the know but is awesome for those that do not.  Reminds me of making a pizza...i can save 20 cents and use generic mushrooms or just use farm fresh organic ones that have a real flavor."}
{"text":"Super convenient location and a real health gem in a vast desert of fast food (Eaton Centre food court)! They are open until 9PM on weekdays, so it's an excellent wholesome lunch/dinner option for students and Financial District employees.   The food and drinks options are the same as the ones offered at the Kensington Market location. They also have a wide selection of vegan desserts (cupcakes, cookies). The portion sizes for the salad bowls and soups are slightly smaller at this site though.  Soups come with bread sticks, so frankly if you have a moderate appetite getting a soup may be sufficient as a meal.  The smoothies and drinks are healthier than I thought! They had 2 types of smoothies last night - berry and green. Both are sweetened naturally by fruits (berries, apples, bananas), so no added sugars yayyy. The cold drinks are sweetened however, except for the mango iced tea.  Lastly, all of their containers, utensils, and straws are biodegradable, 100% petroleum free, and made from plants! How cool is that? :)"}
{"text":"Ok, by far the best mall \"food court\" around.  Tons of selection (healthy to downright artery clogging).    Was there yesterday with my good friend Lauren M....looking for something healthy, which we thought might be a total bust, but lo and behold they have a wonderful salad and sandwich place (Fresh Food)...that review is on its way.  There was ample seating (to be fair, we were there rather early) and the option of eating on real plates with real cutlery?  Get outta town!  We did take out, so was not able to enjoy the clink of my fork against an actualy ceramic plate...no worries though, I'll be back...next time I'll probably enjoy some of the artery clogging fare :)  Overall impression, service was speedy, the tables were clean and honestly it does feel pretty high end for a food court...I really liked it."}
{"text":"Big renovation in the Eaton Center built this pretty impressive modern, food court. At first you're in awe then you start to get the feel of the bustle, the hustle and suddenly you realize it's a mass of human hunger, piling over each other to grab at dirty-dish strewn tables in order to chow down on greasy, sub-par, nutrient deficient and diabetes inducing sustenance.   I guess it could be worse. But I can see why they built it. Mass food for the masses.   Lots of options but you can't sell a donkey and called it a thoroughbred."}
{"text":"The \"Urban Eatery\" has a solid variety of food. It's very large. There really should be something for everyone.   They're making an effort to reduce waste through the use of reusable cutlery and stations to drop it off.   It can get a bit dirty at times, but I guess that comes with the volume of people traveling through.   My single biggest challenge with this food court is the lack of available seating. There either isn't enough seating, or it's configured in a suboptimal way. I think it's a bad layout. There appears to be lots of seating, but somehow it is difficult to find a seat. This is likely because so many of the tables are configured for groups of 4 or more, but most of the groups are 1 or 2. This results in wasted space.  Somebody on staff should go around and separate the tables that have been combined if they're not in use."}
{"text":"Elegantly designed with a futuristic look, the new and improved upscale food court lies on the bottom floor of the Dundas St. end of Eaton Centre. Invested $48 million in renovations and furniture includes revamped washrooms and designer wooden chairs and tables. The most appealing aspect of Urban Eatery is the absence of garbage bins. Instead, customers leave their trays for attendants to sort and clean, sort of like Ikea. With such a large space, the eating area is spacious and clean.   Plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plates are nowhere to be found, as real knives, forks, plates, and bowls are used instead. Several new restaurants have made its way to the array of choices Urban Eatery holds, including Mucho Burritos, Big Smoke Bugers, Froshberg Gelago, Amaya Express, just to name a few.   The restaurant design with stainless steel panels, LCD menu screens, even makes McDonalds, KFC, Subway, A&W, New York Fries appealing to look at.   Urban Eatery has given a whole new \"revolution\" of food court dining and elevates the whole concept of the word \"food court.\""}
{"text":"Shopping can be tiring, especially when you have to lug around lots of bags. Sometimes you need to take a break and grab some food in between, so that you can continue to shop after.  I decided to fuel up at the Urban Eatery. You can literally find every type of cuisine here. Indian, Mexican, Chinese, Thai, American etc. If you've got a group of friends who cannot agree on a cuisine, there is something for everyone here, and you can sit together. We were here in the late afternoon and it was really packed. Trying to find a table can be a bit of a challenge. I decided to get poutine. They had several different varieties. I chose \"The Works\" because it had everything... bacon, chives, beef chili... except for cheese curds. I felt really dumb for ordering the only poutine without cheese curds, oh well."}
{"text":"What a glamourous food court... and about time! The old food court wasn't event a food court - this is the real deal. Some of the fanciest fixtures I've seen - I almost didn't recognize the McDonalds. There is something that caters to everyone's tastes - chinese, burgers, thai, salads, vegetarian... and the list goes on. The place is so big that you will find even more good eats around each corner.  The place is brightly lit, and very spacious. People who were working seemed very courteous and proud to be owners. I got Bourbon street Grill. Wanting to try something new - I didn't even realize that I have eaten Bourbon St. before! They were giving out samples of chicken - how could I refuse. Got it with veggies and rice and then brought it to my dad to share.  Can't wait for the next food court adventure."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I wanted to not like this. I've found the Eaton Centre reno generally old wine in a new bottle. I can't really see what's new other than some new glass railings. The new Urban Eatery, however, is a great addition. There are your old favorites (save for a Manchu Wok) but some new vendors trying to court you.   There's a lot of variation in seating. Fast food style, more leisurely tables, things with Star Trek the Next Generation chairs, and counter seating for boobie watching. Over all the whole thing feels like, and maybe takes inspiration from, a modern Korean/Japanese department store basement food hall.   Loved, in particular, the Shanghai 360 vendor. A decent portion of food. The Rare vendor probably wins for oddest attired. The workers seem to be attired like Emirates Air flight attendants (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/5-KisjcYyWN6Fwcp-wDYmw?select=pn3YP6eyTAglQoObT5km1g).  Where to bus your table is a bit confusing. Look for the big blue signs (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/5-KisjcYyWN6Fwcp-wDYmw?select=afoB6blcEnSZK-_QNncMfw).  All in all the best new feature of the Eaton Centre reno. Give it a couple years and I'm sure people are going to crap it up. The \"burnt orange\" color theme is somewhat disturbing to people who lived through the burnt orange appliance trend of the 1970s. Harvest Gold no doubt will be quick on its heels."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the new food court at the Eaton Centre.  The first time I went there I took a full walk around the place to see what they had to offer.  I was happy to see that they had a wide variety of ethnic foods.  You have your Japanese, Thai, Italian, Chinese, Greek, North American, Mexican, Indian, Bourbon etc.  They also had a number of lighter, healthier options, and a vegan place as well.    There is a ton of seating, which is great since seating in food courts can be sparse at lunch/dinner time.  I also love that they're trying to be environmentally friendly by using actual plates and silverware.  It's still just a food court, but I like the modern feel.  As far as the food goes, it's pretty standard.  The food at the chinese place was average.  I liked the greek place as well, and the portions were huge.  Though a bit expensive, my favorite is the burger place.  They have some mighty good tasting burgers, and onion rings.    I just hope that the other Urban Eatery doesn't have the exact same places.  It would be nice to have more options over there."}
{"text":"This is a huge food court, but then, this is a huge mall.  Eateries are situated along the north and south walls, with a center rectangle within.  As others have stated, there's quite a variety--all over $10.  Once you choose what you desire, you select and pay at that food court station, then bus yourself to a table, table bar, or group round.  After chit-chatting or people-watching over your grub, pay attention to the signs and bus your dishes to a station clean-up attendant.  They come around to clean tables and chairs, not dump your trash."}
{"text":"Actually, I quite like this foodcourt out of all the mall foodcourts around the city. It's the classiest one yet with diversity. I've tried Sbarro a few years back, which was alright. I've dropped by the McDonalds for hot drinks at the McCafe and a McLobster about two years ago. Wouldn't mind trying some new spots there, if I'm there for lunch at Eaton Centre in the future. The thing that deducts a star from this foodcourt is the fact that many years ago, when the Urban Eatery first opened at Eaton Centre, a shooting took place. I know this is now history, but one doesn't simply just forget that such an event took place, so it's still something to take caution to, but I visited the foodcourt today and people of all ages ate there normally so it seems the incident is really a thing of the past.  Bought the teen burger from this A&W Restaurants location in Urban Eatery today. It was alright, exactly what I would expect from A&W, a fairly decent burger but not like super top-notch or anything like that. Would visit again in the future, but sometimes I wish there was more variety on the menu."}
{"text":"If you want to find worms in your soup then Szechuan is the place for you! My dear friend is such a sweetheart and could hardly musk up the courage to go back up and complain. I'm usually not one to complain myself about food but decided to take the reigns on this one and brought the soup back up to show the cashier. After looking at it, she rolled her eyes up and down and told my friend she guessed she'd give her a refund. And that was it. I was appalled. I asked her if she was going to apologize but she simply said it wasn't her fault and had nothing to apologize for. It was shocking to see how little the staff cared about the wellbeing of their customers and the sanitary requirements of their food. Safe to say we will not be going back to the Eatery!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"You can't judge a book by it's cover.\"  That simple adage is so often quoted.    People assume that because the exterior is a particular aesthetic that the underlying substance may not be of equal quality.  This place is simply beautiful   It's arguably the best designed eating space in town.   The common areas are open and airy, seemingly designed to break up the constant shattering rhythm and pace of the supermall.   Meanwhile, the tables and eating areas possess an intimacy that is incredibly difficult to create in such a vast space.   It's darn near perfect.  But what's inside?   The real question.    A pretty food court hawking greasy grizzle is still the same animal.        But that's where this place truly excels.  It offers true variety.   Not just 'food court' variety.    A slew of local favorites are represented.   The centerpiece is undoubtedly Kensington's Urban Herbivore, a more-than-welcome addition to the trollop filled lanes of your average mall food hall.  Sure, just because they have options does not mean that they're being exercised.   A quick glance left and right while sitting down right in front of the Urban Herbivore showcased no less than fifteen people face down in slopbuckets full of fried chicken.  But they sure looked good doing it."}
{"text":"I really do like the open concept of the urban eatery. I also give bonus marks for the huge amount of restaurant options available (even though most of them are indeed, sub par in quality).  However this whole open concept design is starting to lose some feel to it. Now that Yorkdale and Markville both have this similar concept, it just doesn't feel unique anymore. Also, if you order eat-in for any restaurant, it is almost guaranteed your drink size will be smaller than the take-out (regular) size. Their cups are smaller, for gods sake!  The washroom is located in a poor spot in the food court, which is quite a major concern. In fact it might take a while for you to find it if you've never been here before (it's beside the escalators leading to Dundas Station).   I enjoyed the fact this open concept idea will keep workers employed, especially with the concern we're going into an automated society. I also like the environmental benefits: Less trash! The urban eatery just needs to improve on its real value, and honestly I would like to see some uniqueness between these different food court designs popping up in every single Cadillac Fairview mall."}
{"text":"It's impossible NOT to find something lovely to eat here, no matter how picky, poor, or dietary restriction-riddled you are. There are a bunch of Asian places, franchises of local restaurants (awesome!), burger and pizza joints, vegan and gluten-free options, and McDonald's if you's a damn FOO'.  The place is clean and there is a lot of seating. Only complaints are that more of the restaurants should use the reusable/washable plates and cutlery, and that you always have to watch your back so as not to get caught up in gang warfare/stray bullets. Otherwise, lovely."}
{"text":"A very good place to eat, but most of stuffs are pretty pricey. Also funny how most of times McDonald is the busiest compare to all others."}
{"text":"Got to try their muffin and frozen ice cream and let me just say I went back quiet a few more times. It's very satisfying and unlike other stores the taste and content aren't effected by the large portions. Definitely try out if you have a sweet tooth like me."}
{"text":"While the selection here raises the bar compared to some food courts, you'll find the noise level just as deafening, especially during lunchtime. It's a bit mad. Now that I've time to think about it, I'm baffled that they didn't find a way to build the food court in a level with natural lighting; eating in here seems a bit dark and grim. I'd be surprised if many people intuitively linger over their meals; the tone and pace here isn't leisurely.  The bathroom foot traffic is comparable to a sold-out show but things move along fairly quickly. I see staff here cleaning all the time, so that's something good. It's better than most food courts but there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"The Urban Eatery opened today in the Eaton Centre. Formerly known as the \"North\" food court, it used to be dark, dingy and questionable at at times. The selection of places to eat was less than fantastic and overall, it was not an enjoyable place to eat.  And now...  It's absolutely beautiful. The ceilings were raised so even though its at the lowest level of the Eaton Centre and two levels below ground, its still feels large and spacious. There's plenty of seating, bar style, tables, and even some booths I think. Clearly, today was opening day (and there were $10 off coupons given out in the days leading up, so it was expectedly nutso busy) and it was very busy around 1, with lineups at every \"restaurant\" but due to how well the planned the space, I was easily able to navigate through the large crowds to check out all of the eateries they had to offer.   Among the staples, such as McDonalds, A&W and Jimmy the Greek, there are some cool new additions, such as a vegetarian place, a gelato place, some fantastic looking sandwich venues and quite a few interesting places that I am definitely going to check out.  Overall, definitely worth checking out if you work in the area and want something different (or something just the same as usual) and have a nice place to eat and enjoy your meal. If you've never been to the Eaton Centre food court, its worth a look!"}
{"text":"Urban Eatery is a step in the right direction for food courts. Not only is everything super classy (A&W, KFC, Mcdonalds and all the regular stuff are practically night clubs), but the seating is plentiful(ish), they have a decent tidying system (as long as people honor the 'put your own tray away' rule), and they are definitely trying to be more sustainable.   There are so many amazing new options, including gelato, urban herbivore, and many other more \"unique\" (read: not fast foody) options. I find myself going to the Eaton Centre just to eat there - so far I've been able to avoid shopping (pretty sure before this food court, I was avoiding eating there, and just shopping?).   My only negative about this place - and seriously, I love the environment (yay sustainability!) is that I somehow get a little \"yuck\" by the reusable cups. There is something about them... I'm sure they have an intense industrial style washing machine and everything is spotless, but it just kind of grosses me out. I've solved this problem by not getting drinks there (also could likely be solved by a straw... just thought of that).   Another issue is that somehow I go there and end up spending $20 on a food court dinner. Definitely an issue, though hopefully when I get used to all the amazing options I'll be able to deny myself a post-meal gelato or the super fancy coffees.   If you haven't made your way here yet - do it - forget about your shopping and go eat!"}
{"text":"This is a vast improvement from the food court that used to be in the same location. Tons more restaurants & it's great to eat on actual dinnerware & with real cutlery. I would imagine this generates some jobs as I saw people to carting away all the dirty dishes & also sorting the food waste, recycling into bins. So I like those added services. They also renovated the washrooms which was a really good idea as the old ones were disgusting.  I wouldn't go here though on the weekends again. It being Christmas season there were tons of people all around. It was hard to find a seat in the sea of bodies."}
{"text":"Very diverse and high quality food had a moderately to high price. They have everything from Indian to McDonald's. From sushi to subway. Right under the mall for your convenience. Just pray that you are lucky finding seating during lunch hour."}
{"text":"As good a review as I can muster for a mall food court that's not Village by the Grange.   Urban Eatery has assembled a compelling mix of international and local chains offering no less than three burger options, high-and-low end chinese, Indian, ramen/pho, burritos and vegan delites.   Prices are reasonable for the area, and real cutlery, dishes and glassware provides an almost civilized dining experience.   Extra points for including an Aroma, for those who require a caffeinated pause; and for local heroes like Amaya and Liberty Noodle. Glad to see at least some of my hard earned cash going to support local businesses rather than foreign-owned conglomerates.   OK, I like that I get free refills on McDonald's coffee, too.   Seating is ample, and bathrooms range for traditional food court filthy to almost useable, depending on time of day. Ask me nicely and I'll tell you where the cleaner options are within the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR RUBY THAI.   My friend got food from there and found cooked pieces of some plastic wrapper mixed in the food, and a dead bug with weird legs in one of the spring rolls. (I WOULDNT WANNA EAT ROLLS WRAPPED WITH BUGS) The first time it was only the plastic wrapper so they gave my friend the same thing but \"new\"... Then we found that there was the bug the second time so it wasn't gonna cut it. They gave my friend a refund.   Worst customer service as well.. I came and asked for 6 PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS.. and the lady kept telling me to go on the opposite side so I did and then I told a different lady and she told me to go back and this happened like 4 times where I had to walk back and forth cause they didn't friggen understand english.   I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The Szechuan place at urban eatery is way better.   Im not saying every time you'll find something in your food but one time is enough.   Pay attention to where you eat, and what you eat. Id be careful eating at Ruby Thai. I think public health needs to pay them a visit.  That's all. Never coming back"}
{"text":"This place is not overly exciting to me. As far as food courts go, it's a lot shinier and cleaner than most, but at the end of the day it's still a food court. Lots of obnoxious people stuffing their faces and making a mess.  They do have some staff at hand to clear trays and keep things generally tidier than the average food court.  Food selection is normal - fast food burgers, Chinese, Thai, Subway, greasy chicken and pizza joints. There is a nice salad place called Fresh Food and a few other somewhat healthy options."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Clean, comfortable, bright and modern - this is a food court you actually want to attend to.  The makeover was definitely worth it! The space evokes a Scandinavian minimalist approach and gives it a functional and fashionable feel. The various-sized seating arrangements allows for a dense, but not uncomfortable, setup. The use of real utensils and tableware makes it more classy and cuts down on waste (though it's debatable whether this is actually more green when you factor in the costs of washing and the bright lighting).  The highlight of the Urban Eatery, as other have already yelped about, is the variety and quality of the offerings. It's as if you have the \"fast food\" option of what usually are sit-down restaurants (and there IS a sit-down Japanese resto, though it always looks empty) in addition to your obligatory McDonald's. And even then, McDonald's has never looked so fine."}
{"text":"When Chinook Centre in Calgary first opened it's new food court a little less than a decade ago, I was in awe. It was massive, had huge windows that let in tons of sunlight, included sculptures, etc. Totally awesome.  The Urban Eatery puts that food court to shame. This food court makes you feel like your dining at a classy restaurant with gourmet options. The decor is modern and trendy, warm and inviting. There are some many great places to try here I almost don't need to go anywhere else at this point to try a new restaurant. If you're feeling a little apprehensive, not to worry. There's still some old standbys like McDonalds and KFC.  The thing I love most about this court is that your food is served in actual dishes. Not only does this make for a nicer experience but there isn't any waste by having your meal served on a paper plate and eating it with plastic cutlery that is going to be all thrown away 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Veel Keuze aan verschillende keukens, rumoerig, niet netjes ( eten op tafels en vloer ). Hadden bij de Thai soep besteld. Was toch heel anders dan op het plaatje. Ipv de bief, zoals werd gesuggereerd was het vlees met groenige glans met heel veel zenen. Oneetbaar dus. Dat was tegenvallend. Bouillon was wel goed."}
{"text":"The food court here is massive but I didn't find any food that was super yummy. I had jimmy greek and my husband had Tim horton's (which we had never had before and it was not at all impressive) and he also sbarro. There are many other options so I obviously didn't sample all of it. It is just an ok food court."}
{"text":"the best eatery in all the land!  no seriously, this is pretty awesome, having come to the eatons centre for the last two decades, this is and should be a benchmark for all malls to achieve, real cutlery, real plates, and real drink-ware. no matter which restaurant you fancy, this little touch makes it feel alot more \"warming\" to eat here. the only downside to this is that finding a place to sit is a complete pain, there has been a handful of times where its been to the point of giving up looking for a seat, it literally takes that long, or worse, it takes so long to find a seat the food gets cold. so my advice would be, if you're with friends, grab the seating first, and hold onto it.  as it is brand new, it is very clean, even with people being disgusting when they eat. another feature that makes this \"benchmarkingly great\" is that it has stations all through the seating area, where attendants actually wash everything once the meal is done. feels super classy eating here, and its a massive improvement from anything that existed in previous years. in line with the eatons centre it self, its only closed two days of the year, so its always an option to swing by cause the hours are great.  huge huge fan."}
{"text":"I love what they did with the north food court. I remember back in the day while working at the Eaton centre and coming here and it being so sad. Now it's pretty fantastic.   Location: On the lowest level of the Eaton's center by the Dundas subway station  Parking: Take the subway. For real.  Ok well there are really  three choices of parking. You can park at the Eaton's center and pay a small fortune, park at Yonge Dundas square and pay a small fortune or park at atrium on bay. Which on the weekend is really quite reasonable but can be really busy!  Decor: Giant room. Food stalls line the walls. Giant kiosk in the middle with some food places.  Seating throughout. Tables. High tables and also bar seating. Can be busy.   Used real plates, cutlery and glasses.  Food: Almost anything you want you can find there.  From KFC to vegan to salad place to Indian and everything in between!  I love eating here. The vibe the food, the location. It's convenient and you can get a really great burger!!"}
{"text":"I love it. It's similar to the mall food courts in Hong Kong (which I absolutely LOVE), Urban Eatery is definitely a lot worse than HK's, of course, but I don't expect much as I'm not in Asia anymore...  HK mall food courts are like this: you get a LOT of restaurants (mix of fast-food and sit-in restaurants, yes AT the food court and inside the mall), very clean environment, washrooms are beautiful srsly (and I'm a germaphobe), you're not stuck with the same fast-food chains, and ANY food you order is pretty good (big portions too, huge plus).  Urban Eatery looks sort of similar... nowhere close, but a great first-step in the best direction. And I'm very happy about that as I'm half a world away from HK.  I miss HK mall food courts a lot... the Urban Eatery in Toronto makes up for it.   Thank you very much.  P.S. Big Smoke Burger has AWESOME poutine!!!  P.P.S. Good to see you, Aroma [Espresso Bar]! Love you lots!"}
