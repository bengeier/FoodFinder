{"text":"Very creative and delicious! Never had this style of ice cream before. I had the green giant, which is green tea mixed with strawberry. It was an very interesting and yummy combination! Love it!"}
{"text":"Rolled ice cream!! Who was the genius that came up with this idea? I went in today because I had heard great reviews and was in the area. I ordered the strawberry banana and got Oreos on top. Oh Em Gee, this was the best ice cream I've had in a long time. The customer service was great, the price was great, the serving was great ( a little too much for me), the presentation was great and the product was awesome! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow wife went uniform shopping son and I snuck in here to see what it was about. You can not get much fresh cold treats then made in front of you with the toppings and flavors of choice. Let alone it is not loaded down with sugar ice cream. Cant wait to go back again..."}
{"text":"It's hard to decide how to rate this place. I am beyond thrilled that Thai rolled ice cream has arrived in the CLE. That being said, I can't help but compare to other Thai rolled ice cream that I have had. Although this was a delicious treat, imo the quantity of fillings and toppings was stingy. There was also something else a bit different than what I've had. The best way I know how to describe it is that it had a bit more of an ice cream consistency where as what I've previously had was slightly more cake like. Still, it was delicious."}
{"text":"This afternoon, my sister and I tried out the new ice cream shop in Mentor that serves traditional Thai street food/dessert, Thai ice cream. One of the best tasting ice cream ever! Just like home. I had the Monkey Business, fresh banana with chocolate drizzle blended together and rolled into Type-A, neat, round perfection rolls."}
{"text":"You will be blowed out of your mind with this place! I went here with my family and trust me, you will be amazed! I absolutely love this place. If you ever go here, get the strawberry smoothie and the key lime pie ice cream. I highly recommend this place. Stop by this place, and after you're finished, you will forget all your  worries and be happy after your decision of going to that place."}
{"text":"Took a while to have our number called but worth the wait, kids loved watching the ice cream he made right in front of them."}
{"text":"A creative and fresh approach to ice cream!  The choices are abounding and the ingredients fresh.  Ice cream is made-to-order and it was creamy and delicious!   The ice cream rollers arms must be very sore at night after preparing all of the ice cream on the cold metal sheets.  Love the concept and the ice cream was great.  Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Really enjoy led it, a little pricey for some but worth it. Couldn't wait to take the family back but noticed they weren't open yesterday? Out of business? Had to be the poor location if they went under"}
{"text":"This place is simply AMAZING. The ice cream was so delicious and fun to watch being made. This will definitely be our new place to go in mentor."}
{"text":"Delicious raspberry ice cream. It is very entertaining to watch them freeze and roll the ice cream in front of you. It is a good portion for $6."}
{"text":"First off, mad thanks to my friend Ali for telling me about this place only 2 weeks after its grand opening. I don't think I would have found this so quickly without her help.

Thai rolled ice cream is a new kind of dessert that has been slowly growing its presence in the United States. Known more commonly in Thailand as \"stir fried ice cream,\" rolled ice cream involves taking ice cream and other ingredients, placing them on a -35 degrees Celsius grill, mixing the ingredients together, then flattening the mixture out before making cute little rolls out of the mixture. While rolled ice cream has been around in Thailand and Asia for many years, it only started picking up steam (or maybe ice in this case?) in late 2015. It's a trend that slowly grew in 2016, and finally a place has popped up in the Cleveland area.

This was my first time ever trying rolled ice cream, and I must say I was very impressed. I got the Green Giant - matcha ice cream mixed with strawberries, and for toppings I got strawberries, mangoes, blueberries, a roasted marshmallow, and a Pocky. The first bite was a little weird, but by the second bite I was hooked. Honestly, it was not my favorite flavor - the one I liked the most was definitely my friend's Morning Latte flavor. 

The price is extremely reasonable - about $6 for an extremely sizeable portion of rolled ice cream with 3 toppings and a syrup on top. 

Surprisingly, for only being its second week since opening, the lines were incredibly long - I came here at 6:30 PM on a Thursday night and I still had to wait a half hour to get my ice cream. The line was constantly growing, but people were willing to wait to have their ice cream served to them. The wait is well worth it - this is some amazing ice cream. It would have been nice if they sold some beverages to drink as ice cream can make me a little bit thirsty, but that is a very minor issue on Cleveland's first edition of a rising food trend in the US.

Anyone who has never had Thai rolled ice cream and lives in the northeast Ohio area MUST come to this place to try it at least once. It is a very unique experience, and one that is currently hard to find elsewhere in Cleveland, let alone the state of Ohio."}
{"text":"Had to wait 50 minutes for ice cream.  Upon walking in we weren't aware of the time commitment to get rolled ice cream.  While entertaining to watch...definitely not worth the time."}
{"text":"Visited during a week day while on a road trip. I have visited and reviewed other rolled ice cream locations before and I was excited to do another. The space was huge, you could tell it was set up for a different type of business in the past. I enjoyed the pictures of the different menu selections they had posted. The menu is pretty standard, what you usually see at a rolled ice cream place. It would be nice if they offered different ice cream base like lactose free or a vegan option. 

Service was good. They were accommodating to special requests. They allow for 3 additional toppings at the end. The ice cream it self was ok, the base was not super creamy but did the job. The ice cream maker added some entertainment when he doodles on my ice cream before rolling it up. Huge portion was also a plus. Can easily be split if your not a huge ice cream fan. Cost was appropriate compared to other places I have been to.

Some things were broken like a stool in the front of the store and cleanliness was only fair for it being the middle of a week day but that's easy to look past if you weren't looking to review the place and experience. 

I would stop again if in the area. Maybe they could add some new selections as mentioned above."}
{"text":"8 Below presents a new way to eat ice cream, in a rolled form. Unfortunately, new isn't always better. The quality of the ice cream was subpar, and overpriced. The atmosphere feels out of place, like it was set up overnight. The staff seemed very friendly, but I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"It's like the hibachi of ice cream! Amazing if you're willing to wait...but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was ehhhhh. They don't have options for a cup of water on the side,  or any other drinks and it is very hard to hear while ordering."}
