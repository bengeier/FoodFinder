{"text":"Very quick delivery. We ordered Spicy Beef Mongolian that was good but the Pad Thai was not great.  Way too many bell peppers in both dishes."}
{"text":"This place is really nice quiet and clean great place for date night. Good food big portions. Nice service. I will definetly be returning!"}
{"text":"Not disappointed at all....love their selection and portions ..will definitely be making it my Chinese food.. go to spot..."}
{"text":"The food here is good but,just a little to salty. The service is excellent. Prices are reasonable.Will definitely return"}
{"text":"New favorite Chinese food! This place has amazing dishes, great prices, and generous portions. Staff is super friendly and service is very fast! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The garlic chicken and sizzling rice soup are amazing. I also had some Mongolian beef - a little different cooked with bell peppers, but delicious. Definitely will be ordering delivery from this great restaurant on a regular basis!  Delivery was fast and the food was piping hot."}
{"text":"I was in the area craving milk tea. Conveniently I spotted a sign advertising boba in the window! The restaurant's decor is modern. I ordered a thai tea and milk tea ($4 each). The cup is probably equivalent to a large at other boba places. It was really sweet and the boba was a little hard, but I enjoyed it regardless."}
{"text":"We came in today for lunch based on the reviews. we were greeted and seated immediately by a young man.  we immediately were served a bowl of fried won ton skins and sweet and sour sauce.  we ordered two lunch specials.  my combonation chop suey was wonderful, fresh vegies with chicken, beef and shrimp.  it had a large amount of meat.  my partner had the orange chicken which was very good too.  The fried rice was flavorful and the chow mein had a nice hint of garlic.  the lunches were served with delicous hot and sour soup and a delicious egg roll.  Service was vedy good.  Drink refills came quickly.  The decor is very clean and comfortable.  we will definitely be returning when we are back in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Was looking for good Chow Mein and a friend recommended Chow Mein House on Charleston. We stopped in for lunch and they had really good specials. My goal is as to find good Chow Mein but instead I ordered the katsu chicken which was great. The person I was with had the General Tso's Chicken. The really enjoyed it. The spice and flavor was good and the portions were just enough. Given my first experience I will definitely be going back for seconds and hopefully thirds."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service horrible.  The server never smiled and was difficult to talk to.  We ordered lettuce wraps and they brought 3 lettuce leaves.  When we asked for more lettuce, he rudely said-  it's $2.  I have never been charged for more lettuce at any restaurant!  Not only that but most places bring you more than 3 pieces to start with!  After this experience, I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I come in for lunch often, and I always come hungry. This place has such friendly staff and I always feel welcome. The food and Thai tea is always great. I'm a vegetarian and their tofu here is wonderful. Will return!"}
{"text":"Bad Customer service. Got a order together for 4 lunch specials and called at 3:55pm. They tell me that they stopped making lunch specials at 4:00 pm. This is something that they serve all day but you get smaller portions before 4. So it's not like they put the food away. This is the type of a decision that makes or breaks a restaurant. To many establishments look to say no so quickly but a yes goes along way.This was for going to be for 4 people from 4 different families. Now they lost business from 4 families who will tell others. Plus we cater in twice a month and was looking for a new Chinese place. Next time this place answers the phone at 3:55 for 4:00 deadline they should think twice about saying no."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD IN VEGAS!  Ive ordered from a few places around town and I must say, Chow Mein House is FANTASTIC! It was delivered ultra fast, piping hot, and full of delicious flavor! I liked it so much I decided to go to the restaurant to dine in and I was not at all let down! It was even better than the delivery which was quite impressive. As of this moment, I again placed an order and can't wait until my feast arrives! I'll post pics once it is delivered. Great prices, great service, AWESOME FOOD!"}
{"text":"First time here, very good we will be back!Excellent orange chicken and cashew chicken!"}
{"text":"Terrible food! Found a bug in food n showed it to them n they said it wasn't them? Do you actually think someone would put a bug in their own food after taking one bite??"}
{"text":"Here for lunch and I can't believe how fast the service is and how good the food is!  I had cashew chicken and it was super hot, fresh and tasted great. Lots of cashews and the veggies were still crunchy. They brought me a huge plate of cashew chicken, fried rice, cup of soup and a egg roll all for $7.95. That is cheaper than going to a fast food place and the atmosphere is nice. First time here but will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Something in our order was wrong and I told the waitress and she got super defensive saying that she confirmed with us and we said it was okay. Though that's not how we remembered events going down, she still argued she was right. She was so rude that I was in shock. She continued to be rude and short the rest of the meal. The food came out quick but there was truly nothing special about it. There was no salt so there was absolutely no taste. I visit Vegas from LA often and am always eating at new places, but I will definitely not return here or recommend it to anyone I know in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great! The quality and quantity is worth the money. Staff and owner are very nice. This place is a lot better than what was previously in that space."}
{"text":"First off good food but it arrived with spilled soup everything was wet soup was half full as probably because it spilled chips where wet rice was wet only thing I ate was egg roll"}
{"text":"We ordered the Family Dinner Special B & was really disappointed at how everything tasted. The hot & sour soup was overly salty., that I couldn't even finish it! The egg roll skin tasted gummy w/o the typical crispy texture (maybe the oil temperature was too low?!). For the two main entrees, we chose Mongolian beef & Prawn with lobster sauce, which were low quality as well. The beef had a weird texture & was too sweet. And the prawn's \"lobster sauce\" was too wet - the sauce was soup-like consistency!   I threw away the take-out menu & won't be ordering from this restaurant again. It's unfortunate, since we were excited to try out a newish Chinese restaurant in our Summerlin neighborhood. :("}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh and delicious!! We had, potstickers, crab Rangoon, BBQ pork, spicy chicken wings, egg foo yong and General tsaos chicken and man was it great.  Prompt service in a clean and modern restaurant, which was still warm and inviting. Highly recommend especially if you're a fan of east coast style Chinese food, this place is great!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Orange chicken! Everything is nice and clean here. Nice staff, fresh food. Impressive:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything we ordered was so good! Delivery was super fast. Prices were fair and the menu has good choices. I will definitely be going back to this place over and over."}
{"text":"Tried this place for takeout. The food was delicious and menu selection was hearty. Prices are a bit higher than other Chinese restaurants but considering they probably pay a steep rent for the Summerlin location, it's understandable.  The host was extremely helpful when we picked up our order. The added hospitality was a nice touch.   Will be back for sure in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.   No way is this place NY quality Chinese food.       These people have no idea what good food is.    I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"The best experience I've had thus far since moving back to Las Vegas!!!! The food and service was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Great food, great price, service sucks. They don't understand English which tells you they are authentic Chinese from New York. They also don't refill your ice teas or see if you need sugar  or possibly hungry and want more to eat. So order everything at once cause you will need a horse whisperer to explain customer service to them. Otherwise enjoy great food and they love service dogs do bring all your animals for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Awful experience with this place... The called us 40 min after placing our order online and said they would charge extra for red pepper!!! Never in all the years has that been told to us... like saying you have to pay extra for sauce on a plate of spaghetti... Out of pure principle (and insulting my intelligence) I cancelled our order that would have been late even if I would have been an idiot and paid extra for red peppers... I just don't get places like this.. Do they not realize the American restaurants  are built on customer satisfaction, good food, word of mouth and referral's/ repeat business ...For probably about 25 cents worth of red peppers (their cost) they lost almost an $80 delivery order... PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH...."}
{"text":"Ordered today at 3:15 pm. Everything was as ordered except they put chicken in the shrimp fried rice. Delivery was before promised. All of the food was tasty. Shrimp Vermacelli was perfect. General Tsos chicken was great.  We would recommend this restaurant for eat in or take out or delivery.   Great place."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a step-up from Panda Express. But not ready for a full on authentic Chinatown restaurant where you need to really know your  Chinese food. We have been looking for a Chinese restaurant to replace Diamond China over at Sahara and Valley View since it closed. This is why we decided to try Chow Mein House. The noodle house was nice and clean. Our host/ waiter was very friendly and attentive, pointing out helpful tips on what to order. Except for a little mishap with the water being spilled on my daughter, everything went pretty smooth. The bus person was very sorry. The Service was really fast, the food was very tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. Although we have not found the replacement for Diamond China, this place is still a good place to eat Chinese food. We will be coming back and recommending this place to family and friends. The search continues"}
{"text":"Excellent quality tonight!! Sesame beef, chicken chow mein, veggie rolls and tempura prawns. Delivered early and piping hot."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery but I live just down the street. Ordered pot stickers and orange chicken. Both were delicious! Not a big fan that the order didn't arrive with silverware/chop sticks/napkins. I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"The food to me was just decent. Service was good. Thai tea was too strong. The decor is really nice & fancy. Maybe even too fancy for what it was. It kind of reminded me of a fancier/expensive China One."}
{"text":"I looooooved China tango.. Not knowing it changed I ordered my usual 2 entrees and soup.. Pulled up and saw the new sign.. Was a little caught off guard but couldn't turn back now. Everything was a little different (recipes vary I'm sure) but it was all very good! Didn't get the Thai iced tea this time which I usually do.. I can't wait to try it next time! Super nice staff!"}
{"text":"First off, good was really good... Service, needs some wotk. We felt rushed even tho the place was empty. Very rushed. Would have got 5 stars if they didn't rush us thru the whole meal. It's too bad."}
{"text":"The Chow Mein House has great food hands down. Excellent flavors and seasoning, crispy veggies and delicious sauces. The comb. fried rice just the best with large shrimp. We will be back."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is delicious, service is excellent. This is our 5th time here, never had a bad meal. Very clean and nicely designed. White table linens on the tables, and a very friendly place."}
{"text":"Cute decor. The restaurant is new and clean.  I had to chase down the staff to put in my order but they were pretty busy.  The portions were large for the price. A huge plate of general chicken with friend rice, soup, egg roll, and wonton chips for $7.99!  I would come back but would probably try something different. The sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"I have dined in several times and also had food delivered a few times. The food has been consistently good.  Everything always taste super fresh and the menu has a large selection of items.  My favorite is the honey walnut shrimp! Delivery wait time has always been better than expected. inside is very clean and has a nice relaxing atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"For a chow mein house, it was the worst chow mein I've ever had. There was an overwhelming fake garlic flavor that took over the dish and I love garlic. Wasn't crazy about the other dishes we ordered. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the crispy duck.  The duck was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The flavor was incredible.  Really enjoyed it.  Wish I could make it this good at home.  The chow mien was flavorful and had ample chicken.  Really enjoyed it.   For the price and the atmosphere this is now a favorite for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I finally found an amazing Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. It is as far away from the congested and less than clean Chinatown places as one could hope for. Everything about the experience was outstanding. The wait staff was top notch and attentive. We ordered the Mongolian Beef and General Tsao Chicken as a barometer. They were both perfect. The food was prepared in a flash and was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked with high quality ingredients. The place is clean and relaxed. I wish I could move in!!!! Will be going back again and again!."}
{"text":"So, I just ordered delivery from Chow Mein house. There are typically a few things I expect from delivery; the food will most likely be cold and it's never as good as dine in. Well, I have been so pleasantly surprised! Wow wow WOW! Not only was my meal steaming, this is the best Chinese food I have experienced in Las Vegas. I have ordered a few Chinese takeout meals and have had to throw away the left overs because they were so terrible. Chow mein house is so amazing and I can't WAIT to order from here again. The portions are massive and I can't get over my amazing meal. The prices were a little above average but it was worth it. The sesame chicken is delightful and the chow mein is phenomenal. I'll be raving about this for awhile. YUM!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot food! Very nice atmosphere.  Silverware was little dirty asked to replace the silverware. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving...  When you come in, you will be surpised on how the tables are set up with white linen, formal table setting awaits you and a server that wears a black bow tie. This is grand and intimidating but honestly it feels great.  I went here for lunch with a friend and a dinner with my hubby. Both of them enjoyed their food and the concept of the place. The food portion, quality of food and service are amazing. I actually enjoyed the crispy wonton with a sweet and sour sauce for compliment. It's so addicting!   Try this place if you are craving for Chinese food and you'll love it."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this at all. I got the Singapore Noodles.. they were yellow, dry, and not good at all....  I also got the hot and sour soup. It was bland and had chunks of fatty, stringy mystery meat in it.   I was not impressed by this place and will never be back."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant changed hands .... The environment is friendlier, cleaner and more pleasing but the food is terrible even looks terrible"}
{"text":"HOT HOT HOT food upon delivery........GREAT JOB! I love it when my food is delivered fresh and hott.   This was my first time trying out this place and I placed an order online for delivery. It gave me an estimated wait time of 45-60min. I called the restaurant 5min later to make sure they received my order. The man who answered was friendly and told me it will be about 45min. Delivery was ON TIME and came in 45min and I was so pleased to find the food scorching hot and Super tasty. The lady who delivered it was also friendly, especially when my pups ran to her, smelling her out.   I ordered the black pepper steak, pork fried rice, eggplant tofu (my staple at Chinese restaurants and this one was yummy & not oily), crispy chicken noodle, orange chicken, and hot & sour soup. Literally, everything I ordered was yummy & not oily. By far, the best Chinese in Summerlin."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable experience at Chow Mein House at lunch. I received exceptional service from my waiter Frank, the food was perfectly made and served quickly at correct temperatures. The hot/sour soup was quite good and the Orange Chicken was the best I've had. The hostess was efficient and courteous. I could not have been more pleased. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered here for a lunch with a cpl of co-workers. We loved it. food was delicious. Delivery was prompt. Driver was courteous. Menu was detailed. Online ordering was easy."}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished a memorable meal from this establishment.Memorable in that we will remember not to go back.We had lemon chicken and combination chow mein.The menu listed about five different vegetable in the chow mein. Yummy right? Not. I couldn't locate my magnifying glass so I was only able to discern the tiniest trace of them. A one inch carrot string here, another there. The noodles were amazingly uncooked and burnt at the same time while tasting very smokey. The shrimp were absolutely tasteless, the beef must have been taken out of the old cow's home for slaughter and the chicken was quite possibly an old fighting rooster. The lemon chicken consisted of a thin chicken finger like substance with a weak lemon sauce on the side. NOT A GOOD MEAL FOLKS!! My wife picked up the meals at approximately noon and told me, 'There was nobody there\"! I wonder why? Lunch time.........no one there. Pass on this place unless everything else is delicious."}
{"text":"Salty and smallish portions. Same mysterious soy-sauce-like sauce on every dish. $1.00 surprise up-charge per brown rice request (this is so 2010...) and lunch specials are pretty much dinner priced at $8+. Nobody's doing you any favors here. And what's up with the nasty bowl of wonton crisps w/red sauce? Gross.  Weird service and off-putting attitude from some of the most unappealing servers I've ever encountered at any restaurant. I won't go into too much detail, but cold sores were visible... no lie. And dirty silverware (dried food chunks visible) had to be swapped out for less-dirty silverware. (Bring a pot of boiling water?)  Had some food leftover and felt like taking it to go, just in case I was in a desperate hunger situation later? I asked nicely for a box to be brought to the table, and the waiter shuffled my plate away, and when I asked for my plate back, and he insisted on taking it away and boxing it up in the back (pet peeve).  Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway - I won't be going back. China One does a *much* better job at Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were hungry so we ordered delivery from here through Eat24. We bought the dinner package A, which came with egg rolls, a choice of soup, two entrees and fried rice. For our two entrees we went with the beef broccoli and the orange chicken. I was a little disappointed with the chicken because it had sat too long (before being delivered) with the cover on and the steam caused it to be soggy rather than crunchy. However, the beef broccoli was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. There was more than enough food for us to share and this is a good deal if you are looking for takeout."}
{"text":"I rather not eat here again..i pre paid and pre tipped and only asked for chopsticks,spicy sauce,and No Onions or garlic.which I didn't get any request satisfied...onions,no utensils at all,forget chopsticks,not even a fork,no sauce.   The food didn't make up for that either. It wasn't puke pie,but it was too salty,watery,and should be called and complained,but whatever man...you win,you lose."}
{"text":"We order delivery thru yelp at least every couple of months and the order arrives on time and correct. Tonight not so much. We ordered string bean chicken with xtra spice, bbq pork fried rice add bean sprouts, sweet & sour chicken w/ veggies & sauce on side and xtra crunchy noodles. Did not receive ANY crunch noodles, when called they offered to have driver come back who took the xtra money for them & person on phone stated that if asking for special things u need to call & not order delivery thru yelp b/c it's a fax & they have been getting calls like this lately. Then we opened rest of order, no spice added to string bean chicken, no veggies on side and no sprouts in fried rice. Very disappointing. I did not call back b/c their excuse was pretty lame when this was our 1st time we had issues. So will think before ordering for delivery!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and ordered takeout. Had checked out the previous Chinese restaurant in the spot, which seems to have since changed management (or at least rebranded).  Ordered the: - walnut shrimp (terribly heavy and sweet) - crab rangoons (fluffy, flavorful) - spring rolls (just okay, but came free) - chicken fried rice (amazing)  Service and prep was prompt and friendly. Definitely ordering again! Just not the walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. We ordered takeout last night. We ordered kung pow chicken and combination lo mein. Both were extremely good. The staff is friendly and my order was ready in 10 minutes. I can't wait to try more dishes. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Saturday. Ordered shrimp tempura. It had a tail but it didn't taste like shrimp and it was soft and mushy. Shrimp is supposed to be firm. Then I ordered mu shu pork, and the menu described it as: Shredded pork chop meat and scrambled eggs, stir fried with cabbage, carrots, onion, green onion, dry mushrooms, bamboo shoot in homemade hoisin sauce and served with 4 pcs of wraps. What I actually received on my plate was pork and cabbage and no other vegetables listed in their description was on my plate.  Other plate we ordered was curry chicken and it had too much red pepper flakes throughout. Also ordered pork fried rice supposed to be in savory sauce but it had no flavor whatsoever. I had to ask waitress for soy sauce and it was clear by her expression she was not happy I asked for soy sauce. Overall very disappointed and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food. Food was delivered in a timely manner & arrived piping hot. Delicious!! Finally a great Chinese place on the west side."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Beautiful Decour with white tablecloth, little on the Price Side. The reason for only 4 Stars our waiter was a little bit unfriendly OK it was a lot unfriendly never smile and brought my wife the wrong type of tea."}
{"text":"Aesthetically contemporary with linen tablecloths & napkins, fresh flowers on each table, and a nice layout of tables & booths. Kung Pao chicken, Orange chicken, Shrimp tempura, and Vegetable soup were all delicious. Request chili oil for an extra level of spice! Adding a better bottled water such as Aqua Panna, instead of Dasani (tap water in a bottle) would be an extra nice touch. Delicious Chinese!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the overall experience, including the service.  First time at this restaurant since the name change.  Had a late lunch inside, not crowded at all.  The waiter wasn't pleasant nor did he seem happy to wait on us.  Took the order very quickly and brought out the food very quickly, maybe that is why the food wasn't hot.  Taste, however, was good.    There were several employees sitting in a booth next to us eating their meal.  Talking very loudly.  We found this distasteful.  Perhaps they could have found a booth away from customers since the restaurant was virtually empty.    Would not visit again."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner here recently. Food was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Everything tastes like it was made in bulk earlier in the day (or a day or two earlier). King Pao chicken and curry chicken we Very greasy. Chicken lettuce wraps filling was mushy and lacked flavor. Even the wonton soup was bad...broth tasted good and veggies in it tasted fresh, but the wonton noodles themselves were mush and obviously had been sitting in the broth for a day or more. I wouldn't waste my money ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Customer service was good, food was nasty like those hole in the wall Chinese American fast food places. Just no....veggie house is way better and more flavorful.....the food was so nasty   Update: went home that night after eating we all got food poisoning! Called to them to tell them what happened the owner was rude and disgruntled didn't even offer an apology. I spent all day in ER will definitely be calling the health department in the morning! EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK  Teng  Z. Review is fake they put that up after we called and told them what we had to try and make it seem like someone actually enjoyed the old food they served us they work with the restaurant don't be fooled! The only review is from today and pictures they put up 10 months ago from, you guessed it chow mein house"}
{"text":"The Best Chinese food in Vegas for real I recommend this highly everything is good pleas try them you won't be disappointed The lunch menu is the best cause you can order like 2 or 3 at a time"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on 3/30/16.....it was delicious.  Would definitely go there again.....needed a good Chinese restaurant.  Loved the hot and sour soup, Kung pao chicken , chicken curry (but I looooove curry anyway) and orange chicken (however were unaware that orange chicken comes with breaded/battered and unbranded/battered).  So you have a choice...do ask as we were not told by the waitress.  Would definitely recommend...can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Chow mein house - NOT your average shopping center take out place! The food  is consistently delicious & fresh  and is up there with any fancy restaurant! Alan, the owner is always present with warm greetings. Love the crispy noodles & duck sauce. The crab Rangoon so so good large & fresh & crispy. Vegetable egg rolls terrific. Everything's always great. They deliver also which is nice . We appreciate the elegant table linens ,a nice touch that most small Chinese  restaurants have given up on! Alan, you are the best as well as your food! Best of everything, your loyal customer ! CB"}
{"text":"Staff is super sweet & this place delivers. Portions are HUGE!! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Try to avoid this place. We've ordered Uber delivery twice and while the order comes quickly, it's often wrong. Tonight one person (who cannot eat shell fish) ordered chicken fried rice. We got shrimp/ chicken fried rice, (which I don't think is even on the menu) leaving one person with nothing to eat. The food was otherwise ok. We called and mentioned the shrimp; they did offer to replace it IF we'd come and pick it up.  Both times we've ordered $40 or $50 worth of food and they send ONE cheap fortune cookie, which is insulting. Why bother? We won't bother ordering from you again and you can hang onto your precious expensive cookies. Greedy, cheap, careless."}
{"text":"We tried their food for the first time via delivery.  So, in fairness, maybe it would've been better had we dined in.  But, we didn't so my review is based on what we did do vs. what we should've done.  We chose delivery 1) because we weren't up for heading out anywhere and 2) a review posted that said from the time of order to delivery it was 21 minutes.  Welllll, our delivery showed up over an hour later (we live 7 minutes from the restaurant) and the food was luke warm.  I had General's chicken and it was greasy, too much breading, a little grissley, and too much dark meat.  My husband had the kung pao chicken and it was drowning in sauce and not at all spicy.  The crispy noodle with shrimp and beef was \"eh\" but smelled fantastic (unfortunately the taste didn't match the smell).  Nothing stood out.  Prior to our order arriving, we called the restaurant to ask where our order was (after an hour of waiting) and we were told that the driver had left with our order over 30 minutes ago.  What!?  Was the driver stuck in infinite loop in one of Summerlin's traffic circles?  What else was he doing!?  Not sure if we'll try this place again.  Delivery or not, warm or hot, the food just didn't have the flavor to knock our socks off."}
{"text":"Very prompt service. Good for Chinese delivery. We received more than we expected. We will definitely order from here again. Thank you Chow Mein House :)"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place I looked at the pics on yelp of the food it looked really good so I thought I would try it ordered threw door dash I was really impressed by how fast the food arrived. I had egg fo young and fried rice and Szechwan chicken food was hot and everything was very good I will order from there again"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and excellent service for dine in, although we normally get take out. Seems to be less oily as compared to other Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Deeply disappointed with one part of our order. As far as the other food, the rest of the family got good meals- shrimp egg foo young, spring rolls, dynamite noodles w/prawns.  The \"Sea Bass\" was the equivalent of over cooked fried chicken. There is no way they are using real sea bass in this pseudo dish. It was rubbery and didn't separate like fish. It was stringy like fried chicken.  Seriously, an imposter dish, dry and bland."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for a month the cooks kill it the servers handle it right as soon as foods finish its served hot ready no heat lamp sit. I always look forward to the bomb orange chicken when I dine here."}
{"text":"Big portions but little inconsistency between bites. Too much breading on some pieces and some dark meat.   Wanted to get a little combo plate with few things but didn't offer anything. Asked and quickly told no only big portions.   Service was okay. Nice staff that smiled and did well but little slow to check-in and refill and brought Pepsi instead of ice tea because it was totally out.   It's located in the mall close to See's Candy. They have good prices so might try again later."}
{"text":"I would give them 6 stars. Creamy white linen table cloths. Lovely waiter. Owner introduced himself-Alan very welcoming. Food delicious and a good value. The atmosphere and decoration is that of a much more expensive restaurant. If you want great Chinese food in a restaurant that makes you feel like a valued guest- go"}
{"text":"The food has always been very good even as many times it's changed names.  There are new owners but the food is still delicious.  I ordered the chow mein w/ chicken & potstickers.   Both are delicious & enough for three people.  The potstickers can be fried or steamed... You get 10 pcs. in one order!"}
{"text":"General Tso's chicken and beef chow mein definitely hit the spot. Door to door service was ready. Food came out really fast and the staff is very friendly. Definitely would recommend this place as your Local neighborhood Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Heading back to the Strip after visiting Red Rock and stopped in for lunch.  I had the Mongolian Beef lunch.  My wife had the Chicken Chop Suey.  The lunches come with soup and vegetable egg roll.   Boy, these meals were great.  The beef was tender and very flavorful.  My wife insisted that her Chop Suey was even better.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.   I had steamed rice and she had the fried rice.  Next time I go fried.    This is about as good as it gets for a quick $8 - $10 lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for over 8 years. Food has always been great and the service is wonderful. They are from China and don't make small talk unless you want to a speak in Chinese. If you have special orders they will make any changes you would like. Not so spicy, extra snow peas. The lunch specials are the best in town and they include soup if you dine in. This restaurant is the American version of Chinese food. It is not PF Chang's or fusion. China a go go's food is bland.   Thank you cook on wok your delivery service is great."}
{"text":"The food is great! They're even willing to leave out any ingredients you don't want which is great for intolerances. Best thing about this place is how fresh everything tastes! It's definitely a new favorite! Customer service is amazing too , they make you feel like you're their best customer even if it's your first time there."}
{"text":"This place was so much better under previous ownership.  They changed ownership and changed concepts.  I've been here several times since the change, and today was the last time we'll come here.    We came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty.  We asked for the lunch special menu but he said they don't offer it on weekends.  This may fly in big cities, but every other Chinese restaurant that I've been to in Vegas offers their lunch specials 7 days a week.   They've switched to linen service.  Why?!  People in the Albertsons plaza in Summerlin aren't looking to dine at a linen service Chinese joint.   Food was good. Service was terrible.  There were three servers watching the TV while there were only two tables (including us).  Our waters never got refilled."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it here. The food is very good quality. Our server, Frank, was wonderful and had a great personality. We will definitely be back. We ordered the kung pao chicken, wonton soup, fried rice, and tai iced tea boba :). This place seems proud to offer attention to detail and good service.  One rice, soup,  and one kung pao was more than enough for 2 people. We brought boxes home."}
{"text":"2.5 stars Just ok. Don't understand the 4 star rating. Food was lackluster and nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered potstickers,  cashew chicken, orange beef and chicken fried rice. Like I said, the food was ok but was about the same quality as Panda Express for a higher price.  We were the only diners at the restaurant and it was after 5 PM on a Thursday. That should have been a red flag. A positive note... the restrooms were very clean and the decor was pleasant. Service was fast, almost too fast. We tried it based on the Yelp rating, but won't return."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The decor is really nice and the waitstaff is very attentive, but we usually get it delivered because we're lazy! They use Beyond Menu which is much cheaper than the other apps ($2.00 to our place), and we ALWAYS get a coupon for a free appetizer. So, so happy to have this good food right around the corner."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife here recently. Pretty good food. Will definitely be going back. Best place we've found in summerlin that's close to our house. There are a few places that will do in a pinch but this place was worth sitting down and enjoying."}
{"text":"Delicious! Almost went to P.F. Chang's but decided to take a chance and really glad we did. Not only is the food great but the service is as well. After our meal the owner came out and made sure everyone was happy and we were! I recommend the shrimp fried rice, salt & pepper prawns and the Kung pow prawns. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just dont know why I do it. I read reviews and know better. Yet, there I am ordering food from here..... I didn't realize that I used to be in the particular shopping center all the time. I happened to be in the CVS next door, but was using GPS to find this so I went so far outta the way to get here. (wish GPS would've just said hey, it's next door!) I really wanted to like this place. It's so close to my house. And I love Chinese food. But no. I did not. We spent a little over $60 for take out and it was......eehh. It was piping hot as it had just come from the kitchen (so it wasn't that). It didn't really have flavor. I didn't do anything for me at all.  The staff is friendly, the place is nice looking but I wouldn't go back. For $60, I could have had waaaaaaay better food."}
{"text":"Wow ! Found this place on yelp and it was so close to my house so my mom and I had to go ! Very upscale looking, great place, amazing customer service and the food was so delicious!!!! Most Asian restaurants have a fishy smell to them but this place was so clean and classy . Ordered the combination chow mein, the wonton soup and mango boba drink . Amazing amazing amazing cant say anything more !!!!! Oh and very affordable"}
{"text":"Quick and good quality food. This has become our go to pick up spot for low key nights. :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the go to spot for egg foo young lovers it is one of the best I have ever had  Super clean well mannered great spot to eat"}
{"text":"Chow Mien House has the best service I've ever got! The food there are amazing! We had Shrimp in the lobster sauce last night, and it was super delicious! My daughter loved it so much that we needed to order a 2nd plate just for her... We will go back for more ;)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food so far in Vegas. Staff was friendly, prices were great along with the food which tasted so fresh. It did not taste too oily or greasy. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have found our favorite Chinese Restaurant. This place has it all starting with tablecloths and linen napkins. The service was perfect including a visit by the owner and a 5 course dinner for two. We had the pot stickers as an appetizer, then egg flower soup, egg rolls, fried rice, Chicken Chow Mein, General Taos Chicken, then a delicious desert. Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was great. We will be back"}
{"text":"Great service and lunch menu. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Food is excellent and priced at a great value."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the past few months but as I tried the different dishes on the menu I finally am ready to leave a review. I will not be returning. First of all the good points of this place the staff is very kind and attentive they will make your dish how you like it. The vegetables are great they are fresh and crunchy not soggy. But most of the sauces are heavy and taste the same I realized what it was that I don't like. THE FOOD IS CONSISTENTLY OVERLY SALTED and I mean OVERLY SALTED.  I asked them less salt but it was still salty. After eating there you will spend the rest of the day drinking tons of water. I don't understand why it has to be so salty. I've had Chinese food that is great and not too salty why can't they just decide across the board to add less salt? I know people love salt and I do too . If you love very salty Chinese food you will love this place. The atmosphere nice. I'm just bummed I have to find another place close to home that I can eat at."}
{"text":"Order the chowmein with shrimp was really good very clean restaurant  they give u crispy wonton chips with a sweet sauce was really good typical Chinese service no smile"}
{"text":"Was happy to see a new possible Chinese restaurant especially one where you can really sit down and eat -- but we were very disappointed . Not good ..  Chicken was dark meat .. Slop. Unfortunately won't return .."}
{"text":"I noticed as I came into this plaza a few days ago that the name had been changed from its previous incarnation and I believe the menu is different also but it was so long since I was here that I don't remember.  I looked at the menu in the window and decided I'd give it a try sometime.  I ordered online through the Eat24 ordering available through Yelp checking a pick up time of ASAP.  I ordered one order of vegetable egg rolls (comes four to an order), an order of Singapore vermicelli, and an order of combo chow fun with a note requesting no shrimp.  The egg rolls were standard and OK.  The Singapore vermicelli had a pepper symbol next to it on the menu but there was little heat to it at all.  Since this was a take out order, I added crushed red pepper from a Thai restaurant I had leftover onto the vermicelli and I made it peppery on my own.  There was a fair amount of been, chicken , and good sized shrimp.  My wife's combo chow fun was good.  It had a nice tasting sauce and they did not add shrimp as requested because she won't eat shrimp.    The take out order was packed well.  I had a 5 minute wait as they had two orders in front of me and my drive is just about a mile.  I was offered water while I waited and the staff was present.  I'll give the place another try.  I could see getting take out from the Chow Mein House from time to time."}
{"text":"I still miss the old China Tango before the management changed a few months before the name change...  BUT, they are putting in the effort, so I can't hate that.   The menu has expanded and the lunch specials are great, though not quite the value they used to be. I don't care for the egg roll or the egg drop soup. The soup is way too thick and yolky tasting for my preference.   The service is mediocre.....slow and impersonal.   I LOVE the Szechwan chicken.   I still need to try more of the offerings since they changed.  Overall, it's okay. I will go for lunch unless they really piss me off just because it's convenient to my work and a good value. It's not good enough to invest in dinner for my family though."}
{"text":"Great food please try the Mongolian beef great price staff was very nice very clean resturant like the old style  restaurants in new York, crispy  noodles they  serve in the  beginning  are  great"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Food is fresh . Great price and amazing portion size!  Definitely highly recomended!"}
{"text":"Nice dressy place with food being small portioned and meh flavored. In fact it does taste Smokey as if made by smokers who do not wash well after their smoke break.       Worst service ever, I have eaten here quite a bit and being a local I had always dined in but for once I had family from out of town and I wanted them to try one of my go to places. You'd think seeing me over and over they would treat me as a regular and nice service. So I do suffer from a case of OCD so I order how I would eat my food and I started with an order of Hot and sour soup, ordered about $70 of food, he repeated my order and I mentioned he forgot about the soup and he said ok and wrote it down, I gave him my debit card and it got declined no biggie I carry cash so il just figure out why my card got rejected.       My card was part of a breach so it was cancelled another card was on its way. So I get my order and I got some of the smallest portions I have ever gotten at a Chinese joint especially for $75, well they forgot my soup so I ask for it and they charge me for it, that's fine ok il pay so I give them a credit card. Now when my card got rejected it was empty so no problem I know I got money I know it was some thing reasonable, by the time they charge me my soup now there are guest in the place. The waiter looks at my card and tells me \"are you sure your cards not going to get rejected?\" Really I just gave you a different card different color and just gave you $75 cash. I ask for a manager and he comes out and looks at me and begins talking in mandarin I believe to the other workers and they say he doesn't want to talk to me. I demand my money back as I felt disrespected in so many ways as I'm getting my money the \"Manager\" approaches the counter with 3 other workers and they begin to speak and laugh and point at me.       I mean really this is a business where someone pays so much for your small portion food and you make condescending remarks in a foreign language I mean if that's the type of business you support then please enjoy. There are so many other options for Chinese please support friendly caring businesses not places like this, if they do this to my face who knows what they do behind our backs. God bless"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have found in Las Vegas. The staff is polite and friendly and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Just got a carryout order. Fast service and delicious food, Love that they will customize your order I.e. Beast meat. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything here is great. I've had almost everything on their menu. Best take out in town! I especially like the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!!!! We couldn't help but order more and more!!! Yummy deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food for take-out and dine-in that I've found! It's made-to-order and the staff are always friendly and quick to get your order in. The price is about the same as competitors but significantly better food in my opinion! The atmosphere is very comfortable and chic, casual and classy at the same time."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Pad Thai is plain and simple horrible.  God, I wish we had a good Chinese restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had vegetable chow mein noodles, sesame chicken with rice, and crab rangoon everything was awesome and super friendly service! Thanks Chow Mein House! :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try another Chinese restaurant just for fun. Food got there in record time. My deliverer decided I needed to put more information on the order in regards to where I live and told me so. Other than that food was ok and service was fast."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre to horrible.  I'd rather eat at Panda Express than eat here again!    Sizzling rice soup is bland with chicken that was graced with a bit too much cornstarch...avoid!  Pad Thai is FULL of red & green bell peppers and purple onions so for my pepper & onion haters out there, do not order this dish!!!  Chicken also tasted like it had been swished around a wok full of seafood....that or it was a day past its prime (I'll find out tomorrow!).    The sizzling seafood dish (#1 house special) should be called swimming seafood stink dish because it is sloshing around in a soupy, dishwater grey sauce that is ick-o!  We picked out the shrimp & scallops to take home & left the rest of the mess (mushrooms that were bruised and probably too old to be eaten, carrots, zucchini, lobster bits & disgusting chunks of non-distinguishable fish).   Service is not any better.  Waiter was impossible to understand, sizzling rice soup was sloshed all over the table cloth, wine glass had leftover lips on the rim, water was splashed all over when glasses were filled, plates were clanked and knocked around very loudly & main dishes were served about 10 minutes apart.    Close to home so really, really wanted to like/enjoy this place, but honestly you will have better luck driving to the next red light & hittin' up the Panda."}
{"text":"Super disappointing... hot and sour soup tastes like white pepper with corn starch, combo fried rice wasnt good at all, hardly any flavor, pot stickers were mediocre at best, chow mein was not even as good as panda express.... the only decent thing was the orange chicken. This is probably the worst $60 meal I have ever bought through uber eats. Anyone that says their food is good might want to seek a doctor about theirbtaste buds not working or try a real Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered of yelp and it said it would be here in 40 but was actually at my house in less than 20 min. I was very pleased and the process was very easy. Everything was very good as well"}
{"text":"It was our first time dining here last night and were so delighted to see the white table clothes, flower on the table and wonderful decor. The food was fabulous and this will be our new favorite restaurant for Chinese food. We had lettuce wraps, crispy duck, combination fried rice and one of the chicken dishes. So good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the new Chow Mein House!  They're awesome, personable and very professional. I saw a post that said the service was not up to par and I'm surprised because they were just amazing and made us feel so welcome.  The food is delicious, hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Tried the Chow Mein because I figured that's what they'd be good for... as well as their chicken curry. Both were just okay. Too many of my non-favorite vegetables in the curry (potatoes were like steak fries) and the noodles were Meh. Definitely not the first place I'll call when I want Chinese food.   Used YELP24 and had the food delivered within 50 minutes. Delivery guy was nice, service was convenient but definitely took a little longer than hoped. Next time I'll just drive the 15 minutes to ChinaTown."}
{"text":"The crispy duck was excellent.  The how Mein was very tasty.   It is not too pricy and the service was excellent too.  Overall it's a good price, place is clean, atmosphere is wonderful, and food was excellent.  I will be back.  .... Came back.  Tried the general chicken.  Big serving and very good.  Had a delicious kick and very tasty.  Also the fried rice was excellent.   Went back recently with a group.  We ordered the general chicken, orange beef, chow mien, fried rice, and katsu chicken.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The orange beef was a bit sweet but still by the end all the food was gone and everyone enjoyed it.  Thus will keep my 5 stars since I would do the same."}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly fresh, and very tasty!  Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It has finally come down to this in our quest for decent Chinese food: either bite the bullet and drive to Spring Valley, San Francisco, or New York, or hop a plane to Beijing.  The only reason I'm giving Chow Mein House two stars instead of one is that I liked the minimalist modern decor - lots of white, a bit of light wood, and green bamboo plants for contrast.  But the food sucks.  We skipped soup, not surprising in 110° weather, but only because we couldn't agree on one.  I wanted to be able to compare the hot and sour with every other place we've had it, but my husband wanted a different one.  So we just ordered two entrees:  Beef curry and Szechuan chicken.  Unlike everywhere else, this fowl (foul?) dish had no ginger listed, so we asked for it.  We also added broccoli.  In the interest of full disclosure, we also asked that no sugar and no extra salt be added.  I realize that this might affect the taste, but the dish had no sauce whatsoever!  When I complained, the waiter said \"well, you wanted no salt or sugar.\"  NO!  I didn't say I wanted no SAUCE, just no extra salt.  I've had Szechuan chicken maybe a million times, with and without the sugar/salt stipulations, and this one was in a class by itself.  And it flunked.  The vegetables in both dishes were undercooked.  One reason I love veggies in Chinese restaurants is because the crisp-tender results are something I can't ever approximate at home.  Oh, maybe I could if I wanted to use a wok at extra-high heat and then clean up the grease for three days.  Here, I almost broke a tooth on unexpectedly uncooked carrot.    The beef curry had absolutely no taste of curry.  The kitchen remade it, and it was marginally better, but that margin was minuscule.  This dish includes potatoes; they were cooked, but with a texture that was downright weird, somewhat gummy, and they didn't taste like potatoes.  Here, too, the vegetables were woefully undercooked.  The final straw came with the bill.  I wasn't surprised or annoyed that they charged $1 extra for broccoli.  But they added another buck for ginger.  Note that they did not take off $1 for the sugar and salt they didn't add.  This was, IMO, beyond petty.  And to update a previous negative comment by another Yelper, the upcharge for brown rice is now $2, not the dollar he complained about.  But at least it's now listed on the menu.  In very small print.  The search goes on."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try on a Wednesday night. Nice and quiet, food was excellent, service pleasant and courteous. I highly recommend this Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Got ours to go, but the dining room looked nice. We really enjoyed our dishes....the sesame chicken wasn't overly battered, and nothing was dripping in oil. It was a little more expensive, but I think you really have to pay for higher quality when it comes to Chinese. We will be back."}
{"text":"Solid choice for familiar yet inspired dishes. Chow Mein House has been open about 18 months and has hit its stride, according to some locals. Went with a small group and ordered a number of things to try, with different tastes and requirements easily met. When you start with the lovely deep fried crunchies and red sauce, you're instantly able to settle into your seats.  The Corn Egg Drop soup is a good starter and great a chilly night. The potstickers can be either veggie or pork and veggie; steamed or fried. The fried were not greasy, and had a nice flavor, especially in the dipping sauce. Tried the Tempura Shrimp, too, which seemed out of place on the menu, but still tasty. Not exceptional shrimp, but the coating and perfect crispness won the day.   The Chicken Chow Mein was a hit. We modified it by removing the veggies (I know, right?) but it was good despite our meddling. The scallops and asparagus special was very good; bay scallops and tons of asparagus with some carrots and black beans in a black garllcky sauce. Also had a nice shrimp and veggies dish (peppers, onion, cabbage and peas) in a eggy clear sauce. If you go with the Chicken Fried Rice, you won't be disappointed - but you may not be blown away. (Not that Chicken Fried Rice is the blow-you-away type dish in the first place, lol).  All in all, good family-style eatin'. Saw a number of couples, too, so the warm hospitable room makes a comfortable place for all parties. Chow Mein House is a great option. It may not have the razzle dazzle of PF Chang's, but it also doesn't have the three-hour wait on a Saturday night. Nice folks here, and I look forward to visiting here again."}
{"text":"I really like this place Maybe it was me but i couldn't find it very well  But it was dark Doesn't really look like an average Chinese restaurant Looks more like an upscale  The place like a small elegant restaurant I had order takeout The food was pretty dang good It was definitely better then a lot of other places i have been to on this side of town  I had the mongolian beef it was really good and not full of onions I like onions but it seems like every place i go to is 75% onions ? I also had the kung pao chicken It was also  super tasty  My only challenge is that it is kinda on the pricer side But the food is good so so im coming here and try something new"}
{"text":"Absolutely gross. So disappointed  the orange chicken was chewy and the beef with broccoli was questionable. The wonton chips and cream cheese wonton have a weird yellow tint to them don't know if that has to do with the flavor. Shrimp fried rice was completely undercooked and inedible. The only good thing was the wonton soup.... just wondering if/how/when can I get a refund on my $40."}
{"text":"For all intents and purposes, this is your standard Chinese/American joint. Nevertheless, I'm giving four stars because I fully enjoyed my meal here. I had been once before when it was China Tango. Not sure if management has changed or if they just wanted to re-brand. Either way, the place feels the same. The decor is nicely refined. I can see this as a place to actually want to eat out for dinner (as opposed to just grabbing to go).  We came in right before 4pm, which was just in time to order from the lunch menu. The items were $8-9, so a little more than \"cheap\" but still decently priced. I had the chicken curry while the girlfriend had the fish in black bean sauce. Both dishes were attractively plated and more importantly tasted great. The service was very friendly. I noticed that they interacted well with the other customers as well. I was wondering if they had built up any regular customers and my observations indicate the affirmative."}
{"text":"This place is used to be called \"China Tango Bistro\", but I think someone bought it and changed to \"Chow mein house\".   I like their lunch specials menu. You get a big plate of food, soup and some chips. The food portion is so huge that I can have two meals with it. I usually order the Mongolian beef with hot and sour soup. Spoiler: if you don't like wood ears, you might not like this soup, but it's very tasty.   Hunan beef, sweet and spicy chicken... are tasty dishes, too.  It's used to be cheaper with the old owner. But with the current pricing status, it's not too bad. They used to not charge to get food with noodles or fried rice, now they do. I don't go here often anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my workplace a couple weeks ago. Delivery man was waiting for about 3-4 minutes for me to get change (since I was with a client), and when I told him it would be just one moment while my colleague ran out to pay him, he told me \"I'M BUSY.\"   Really?? I'm sure he felt like a complete jerk when he realized I gave him a $5 tip, on top of their delivery fee. I should've taken it back. I know there are many people who don't tip delivery drivers at all. He waited no more than 3-4 minutes.   Othewise, the General Tso's was good. their chow mein had a very oily taste and nothing else to it. not somewhere I'd go back to."}
{"text":"The staff here is very appreciative and inviting.   Tasty and simple American style Chinese dishes.  Generous portions for the lunch menu with choice of soup, spring roll and rice.  Key to this place is the food tastes fresh and undeniable fresh and made to order.  No hot plates keeping this food warm.  Atmosphere is unpretentious and neutral in decor.  Other than the fake shoots of bamboo being used to divide the dinning floor into two parts you would never know its a Chinese Resturant. Apparently for dinner service the tables are covered with white linens."}
{"text":"Food was very good but I did not like I had to pay extra for white meat but all dinners were good and staff very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredient, big shrimps and good quality beef.  They do not skimp on the freshness and quality on what goes into the dishes."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of reviews but food was very disappointing and definitely not worth the total I paid. Coming from the Bay Area we are spoiled with authentic ethnic food I guess and I just can't seem to find any good Chinese, so maybe this place is better than others in Vegas. We ordered some spicy items but we're spicy at all. Really wish it could of been better."}
{"text":"My office eats lunch here at least once a week.  The food is outstanding, portions are large, and the price is right."}
{"text":"After visiting a friend in Summerlin hospital we needed to find a 5 star restaurant close by. Yelp provided the perfect suggestion only 1.4 miles away. Very modern decor with real table clothes and black cotton napkins. The service was perfect as was the selections ...many with photos. The portions are very large and prepared to profection. The one and only demerit was the plastic chop sticks. Very hard to hold your food. I've eaten in Chinese restaurants all around the world and this establishment equals or exceeds every one."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant and really polite staff. I have eaten in here and ordered delivery as well and every time the food is always hot and delicious and delivery is prompt. Love it."}
{"text":"This was a really great experience! I ordered the sesame beef and upgraded the side to fried rice for delivery and it came so fast! I'm used to waiting at least an hour for delivery and it was probably only a half an hour until they showed up at my door! Sesame beef was delicious and the fried rice was a little bland but still good! Portion size was great for left overs!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today. We really enjoyed our meal and plan on going back to try the lunch menu. Since it's a Sunday, they don't offer the lunch menu, just a heads up. We ordered bbq sliced pork for appetizer and we really liked it. The sauce it's in is pretty good. We also liked that they put noodles and sweet and sour sauce on the table to munch on. The general tsao chicken was really good. Not to bready which I really like and my mom's pad Thai was tasty. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I've only had food delivered to me from here, but I lovvvvvvvve this food. So good.   I usually get the chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Crab Rangoon & Wor Wonton Soup was great! The Pad Thai wasn't up our alley. Swarmed with peppers, onions and not very flavorful. Delivery service was very fast."}
{"text":"In my 60+ years of restaurant going, this has to be the worst case of restaurant mismanagagement.   We  got there about 6:20 Pm, and there were lots of people waiting, at    6:20 Pm there  were  6 empty tables.At 7 PM ther were still six empty tables.. They made no effort to clean the tables.  Many people walked out in disgust.Waiters would go back and forth to the kitchen carrying one item at a time.  I mentioned that they should clean the tables, and were ignored.At 7:10 we finally left, not even being able to  get our names on a list ,or even ordering take out. I could not tell you about the food."}
{"text":"Feeling upset at the moment. I ordered combination rice, shrimp egg foo young shrimp tempura crab rangoon and 2 drinks. For one they took longer the the time they told me on the phone. I get my food ands not hot. And they forgot my drinks smh... i call them they refunded my card for the amount that will take 3 to 5 business days. But then i go to eat my egg foo young and its horrible. Its burnt and no flavor. I cant tale it back cause im working. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"I don't write yelp reviews quite often, but in this case I felt somewhat compelled to. I wasn't expecting much since I've had my share of bad experiences with Chinese delivery (particularly in this area). This, however, was not one of them. Chow Mein House had good, quick service complimented by very well prepared food. Not to mention the place itself is quite nicely decorated. Not bad at all for your run of the mill Chinese place.   I saved the 5th star only because the drinks aren't available if you order online, and though it is good quality Chinese, it's not out of the ordinary.   I ordered over the phone around lunchtime and my doorbell rang in less than 20 minutes. I had the mongolian beef w/ fried rice (from the lunch menu), sesame prawns and a boba drink. The prawn portions were on the small side, but the lunch portion was healthy. The beef was soft and moist, not the usual tough and chewy. The prawns were tastey and nicely prepared as well. My prayers for boba without the 15+ minute drive have also been answered (finally!), and they make it soft and chewy like how I like them."}
{"text":"We ordered food from here on DoorDash. While the food is delicious, we asked for our Mongolian Beef to be not spicy. This was ignored, and our order was much too spicy. We wound up not eating it and throwing it out. We probably won't order from here again as our requests seem to be unimportant. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Being from New York it is mandatory to have a local Chinese Food restaurant on speed dial. I have found it!  We went on New Years Day and loved it so much, we went back the next day. The restaurant is modern and clean and the staff is friendly with good service. The Wor Wonton soup was delicious. The tofu with eggplant is my new favorite along with the beef string beans. I am anxious to try many of the other dishes. The only thing I am not crazy about is the duck sauce they serve. There is a $2 delivery charge within 3 miles and $3 within five miles. I have no patience so I will just pickup."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 1 star only because the food was tasty, on the other hand bad service coupled with very bad attitudes left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My mom was craving some fried rice but we didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown, so we stopped by here since this place is right by our house. We ordered for pick up and loved how friendly the staff was and how FAST our food came out! I would say we probably waited for only 15 min max on our 4 orders - Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle, Combo Fried Rice, Chicken Katsu (comes with white rice) and Combo Chow Mein.   The food was just alright. The combo fried rice tasted a bit stale and for some reason kind of crunchy. I was also expecting the sauce of the chicken katsu to be tonkatsu sauce like it is pictured in their menu but it ended up being this dark sweet and sour type of sauce that was just okay. The best thing for me was the pan fried noodles and the combo chow mein was pretty good as well. Overall, it's a great Chinese food place if you're in the Summerlin area and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown. It wasn't the best Chinese food we've had but it did the part of fulfilling my mom's fried rice craving."}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant a lot when it was China Tango, and it used to be one of my favorites. Chow Mein House, however, was pretty disappointing. The restaurant was very well-decorated and super cute, but the food was a miss for me. The boba drink was not good, as the tapioca balls were not chewy like they should be. We ordered the combination Chow Mein Noodle, Honey Walnut Prawns, Crab Rangoon, and Egg drop soup, and they did not taste good, that we barely ate it."}
{"text":"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our lunch here.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  The food was delicious, fresh vegetables were abundant, it was served hot, and the flavors were amazing.  A must have is the War Won Ton soup ... the best I've ever had.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Summerlin!   Pros: Most dishes are good. It's as good as China Town restaurants without the drive. Quiet with non-cheesy decor.  Cons: Pricier than smaller China Town spots."}
{"text":"We just ordered this; from time of order and delivery was was about 21 minutes.   The food was very hot and fresh. It was very good as well.  The delivery guy was friendly.  We even got free coke!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place when it was China Tango. The price was right for Chinese food. But, now it's way too expensive for its quality. We ordered chicken fried rice yesterday in which the rice is under cooked! They were crunchy and hard. The chow mein has no flavor and it's missing something. To raised their price and lower their quality is just disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"I'm Chinese.  My husband and I decided to come here and try it out.  When people asks me where can I recommend them to go to have a good Chinese food in town besides Casino... I always said... I don't eat Chinese food in Vegas... Cuz they all changed the recipe...so they should not call Chinese food any more!  But here, today,  I will recommend this place for anyone!! They are having a nice lunch special menu.  Most of them around $7.99 with rice and soup!! Does it awesome?! Not yet! The service is great!  The place is CLEAN!! They are having about 50 different types of CHINESE FOODS!  Come on!! Try as many favor as you want! We will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Best general tso's chicken my husband and I have ever had!! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"They serve some flavor able dishes. I order a variety of their menu items. Their green bean chicken is good and their beef broccoli and hot and sour are great. The only comment is on service. It depends on who is serving you and how busy it may be. But service can be very slow at times."}
{"text":"First off, be clear that while I have spent over $200 on their food, it has only been delivery, so I cannot comment on atmosphere or in store service.  The quick and dirty review is that i am going to continue to order from this location and highly recommend it!  Fantastic quality food, and in my opinion a very good value.  While they are a bit pricey ($10-$16 each for what I order), the portions are LARGE.  Not stupid large like Hash House a Go Go, just very good sized.  My problem has to do with consistency, which I assume has to do with delivery.  A couple examples:  The first time I ordered i got 3 fortune cookies with the delivery (which seemed appropriate as there were 3 entrees), the second time I got none.  The last few times  I have received 8 or nine.  Certainly not a big deal, but an indicator of consistency and standards.  The first time I ordered Mu Shu Pork they forgot to include the wraps (I ate it with rice and it was absolutely YUMMY).  The second time I ordered Mu Shu pork I asked the person on the phone if I could get 2 extra wraps because I did not receive any the previous time.  He said ok, and when it arrived, I did indeed get the 4 wraps it comes with normally.  But no extra wraps.  And I got charged $1 for the 2 I did not receive, LOL.  BTW, I would have been fine with the $1 charge for 2 extra wraps, as the quantity of Mu Shu Pork is so large it wont fit in 4 wraps!  Just goes back to consistency.  I chalk this one up to language barriers.  On a food note relating to consistency, the first two times I ordered the cashew chicken, the cashews were abundant (way more than I would expect being such a high cost item) and toasted/roasted/fried so they had that lovely buttery flavor with the outsides being just a wee bit black for even more roasted goodness.  This last time a bunch of cashews were thrown on top, right out of the can.  Bummer.  Probably because i ordered within an hour of their closing time.  A couple more food notes for the foodies:  While the Sizzling Rice soup is full of the goodies like shrimp, the broth is way too thin in my opinion.  Perhaps others like it that way?  And I LOVE the presentation of the rice crispies --- they are cut into squares!  Not sure what holds them together, but I guarantee it is not melted marsh-mellow :-)  I am afraid to ask how they do it, but the beef in the Mongolian Beef is tender enough to cut with a fork.  The lettuce wraps were kinda bland,  Perhaps I am just used to the spicey ones I get at other places.  And to be fair, there is nothing on their menu that would even hint that they were going to be spicy.  I simply ASSUMED....BAD BOY!  The roast pine nuts were a very welcome twist though!  I highly recommend this dish BUT!  Like the Mu Shu pork, they give you a very generous portion of food, but only 4 pieces of lettuce, LOL.  I suggest you make sure you have some lettuce in the fridge of your own, because once again, the portion will never fit into the 4 pieces of lettuce.  The Honey Walnut Prawns were not what I expected in the least.  While the prawns were indeed large, and I got 8-10 of them, the House Honey Sauce is a glop of mayonaisey repulsion.  I think they need more work on this one.  The menu makes it sound more like a honey glaze of some kind, but noooooooo.  Sweet mayo does not rank high on my gastronomical delights.  the glazed walnuts could use some work too.  Some were just straight toasted walnuts, glaze not included.  To finish on a good note though, I do recommend at least trying this place.  There is a dearth of decent - good chinese food outside of China Town, and I will continue to explore their menu because they have given me hope of finding some really good items."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients are a novelty among Chinese restaurants, but this place nails it. I haven't had anything I didn't like. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not,No refills, had to ask for the check twice. Asked for a to go box and the waitress took our plates and brought them back 10 minuets later in a box. What did you do to my food lol ? What really got me was the fried wonton papers/skins that come out complementary with sweet and sour sauce was pretty bad. The sauce itself was caked over and like gelatin ."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I've finally found it!  The food was wonderful. Shrimp, beef, chicken and vegetables were all fresh and the portions were generous.   I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"The mu shu pork was pretty good. It was almost identical to the same dish I've had at 2 other takeout/restaurants that offer it. Big portion, lots of veggies, lots of port but hate fat in the pork (that's probably not avoidable).  This was my first time getting takeout here and I noticed the white linen and flowers on the tables as I waited for my order. Fancy! Preparation of my takeout meal was lightning fast, and just as expected! Their menu is chock full of all the usual fare and I think this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"First time ordering from the Yelp site and also first time eating here. I must say navigating on the ordering page was super simple and convenient. It was nice to have this service offered. So let's get down to the good stuff. My husband ordered the Generals Chicken and steamed rice while I ordered the Orange chicken also with steamed rice. We got a side of wings as well (I wasn't to sure while I was ordering but thought we would give them a try) So we head over to pickup at our scheduled time and the food was already set to go! Awesome! There was a young guy who greeted me and gave me my order. He was very nice and even a little playful. It's great to see happy people while they work. I had pre paid so I walked in and out, super fast, very pleasant and welcoming. When we returned home we were really surprised at how big the portions were. It could have easily fed another couple but since it was just us two we will save for later on (-: our mean was $12.99 because I always order white meat but even then it was totally worth it. There is enough chicken for two and enough rice for two in each meal. We really enjoyed both chickens but my favorite was the orange. As for the hot wings... I don't think I will order those again, they didn't taste bad but just didn't satisfy my taste buds. My husband wasn't a huge fan of them either so we will skip those next time. Overall I still give this place 5 stars because it was generally a great experience. Just because I didn't particularly like the wings doesn't mean someone else won't. We will be eating her again soon and taking my family when they come to visit! Oh yeah when we were checking out online it had a box for coupons and since we spent $30 we got 4 free cans of coke! Hey I'll take it that was super cool. Check this place out"}
{"text":"My Review Guideline I will always rate in 3 categories and the rate I give is the overall rate of the 3 categories. However, it is not average. The 3 categories are: Ambience / Service / Food 1 Star means \"I do not recommend to people I love the most\" 2 stars mean \"I do not like it, but some people might\" 3 stars mean \"Not consistent, for example, food taste different if I have been more than once\" 4 stars mean \"I would like to visit again, but to invite people I love could be risky\" 5 stars mean \"I absolutely love it, I would like to visit everyday if I could, I'll bring my wife and it'll be the first restaurant to visit when friends come and visit\"  -------------------  Chinese Restaurants are really every where, some are more affordable and some are expensive, a lot of them serve similar type of food, but in general the Chow Mein House was nice.  Ambience For a restaurant that is not so big, it is well organized, with nice clean white table clothes. Also they do not have that typical Chinese restaurant smell. ****  Service Many people's experience at a Chinese restaurant service isn't the greatest with dull tone and almost seems like shouting at you, but other than these general experiences, the service here is good. They pay attention on refilling water pretty well, they take the food away from the table to box it up for the remaining food and everything is quick. ****  Food We ordered Mushu Pork, General Tsao Chicken and Mongolian Beef. General Tsao Chicken was actually very good. It is kind of food that restaurants can make it salty or sweet, but the fried batter wasn't too thick, sauce was nice and delicious. On the other hand, Mushu Pork and Mongolian Beef was on salty side. Yes general rule of thumb of restaurant is that they cook the food little saltier than dull or less seasoning, but for us it was little too much. Hence we ate a lot of rice and as a result we had to box these two to go. ***"}
