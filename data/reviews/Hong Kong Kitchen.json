{"text":"This place is great.. Just had the wonton soup for the 20th time. So good! And prices are great too!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in South Mountain/South Phoenix area; my husband and I order carry-out fairly regularly. The food is good and prices are reasonable. The portions are large, so you can definitely split a meal between two with an appetizer. I always enjoy our food--would recommend them!"}
{"text":"I went on lunch break, and was basically ignored... They weren't even busy. I had to leave and couldn't experience any food... This review is strictly based on service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were trying to figure out what to eat on Easter Sunday and I really didn't think anything would be open, but came across this place (I also have two little picky eaters) anyways they all LOVED the food! Especially my little guys! I'm also pregnant and she made sure I was ok leaving with a big box of food. Made an effort to get to know me. Super nice!! Wonderful service! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food, inexpensive prices, and good size portions... Walnut Shrimp was pretty good."}
{"text":"The shrimp lo mein is the best I've ever had. We have been faithful customers for at least 9 years. Now our kids (ages 3 and 6) ask for Chinese on nights we eat out because they love the food here so much.  Suggest the dumplings, Mongolian beef we ask for water chestnuts and baby corn to be added, and the crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Authentic Asian food. Cook to order, always fresh, great price, highly recommend! Wonton & hot & sour soup is delicious. Great lunch specials! They never use MSG!"}
{"text":"A+. This place has good prices and good food. Better value than most Chinese places around this area and the taste is good."}
{"text":"Excellent! We had Hunan Chicken and it was the best ever! Served piping hot! The server was sweet and friendly and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable. Gaye"}
{"text":"A small town like Madison is lucky to have a Chinese restaurant as great as Hong Kong Kitchen. I've been eating there for nearly a decade and have never had a bad meal. The owner operators are one of the kindest families I've ever met and I've always had friendly service, even when they're swamped. Personal favorite dishes include chicken and broccoli, lo mein, and general tso's, although you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great chinese food for madison Indiana. Best bourbon chicken I have EVER had. And their crab Rangoons are out of this world. Super fast and friendly service. I thought all chinese take out was this good when I moved off to college...and I was sorely disappointed. Really, really good. Best chinese take out I've ever had."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere you would expect from a mom and pop operation (very friendly family staff) and they keep the place impeccably clean (which is in total contrast to not-always-so-friendly and mediocre buffets). These guys serve fresh and healthy dinners with great vegetable combinations at a fair price and if you are extra hungry you can add a couple of cream cheese rangoons, a spring roll, and hot egg drop or hot and sour soup for a mere buck. Their shrimp is phenomenal in every dish we have tried. We live walking distance to an Asian restaurant we still enjoy every now and then but I think we have found our new favorite in the neighborhood. They don't serve alcohol which is a good thing in a family restaurant. Treat yourself and give Hong Kong Kitchen III a try..."}
{"text":"After trying a few different Chinese restaurants in the area, we were so happy to finally try this place. It is by far the BEST Chinese food we've had in south Phoenix.   First of all, the place was very clean and both of our servers were attentive and sweet to my family. We tried 3 different soups: wonton, egg drop and hot and sour (all of which are made fresh daily) and enjoyed them all. The vegetables were nice and fresh in the wonton soup, which was my favorite. My husband was a fan of the hot and sour.   For entrees we ordered the orange chicken, BBQ pork egg foo young, and beef lo mein, all as combo options. (Definitely get the combo option as they make their crab puffs and egg rolls fresh and in-house.) I'm not usually a fan of orange chicken, but I LOVED their version. I think they breaded and freshly fried the chicken and made their own legit sauce--didn't taste synthetic, wasn't that awful fake orange color, and had actually pieces of orange rind in it. I was also a fan of the beef lo mein- beef was tender and noodles were good. To be honest, I had never tried egg foo young so I can't honestly compare it (my granny ordered it), but it has a lot of yummy fresh vegetables on top and the BBQ pork was good. One thing I will mention is that their fried rice as part of the combo was fried rice with soy (not like with egg and other veg mixed in-in case that is what you're expecting-but it didn't bother us).  We will definitely be back as this was one of the most pleasant eating experiences we've had in this area!"}
{"text":"This place Would get a 3 from me on a scale of 1-10. Nothing was impressive. Sweet and sour chicken 95% batter. Shrimp with vegetables had very few tradition Chinese vegetables. Soup broth tasteless. Egg roll no flavor. After seeing precious ratings I feel like I'm at the wrong place."}
{"text":"We have ate here many times and it never disappoints! Orange chicken and house fried rice are some of our favorites. The crab puffs are amazing too!! Best around south mountain!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for their convenience and good service.  Order the family dinner to save money and get a soup and apps included in the price."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food since china town in Chicago! Always add the combo plate. Great value and absolutely amazing crab puffs, egg roll, hot sour soup or corn egg drop! The serving sizes are incredibly generous. Especially for the Great price! Very traditional. Kind and attentive waiter. Fast services. This is a gem tucked away in so. Mountain! We had Moo gu gy pan and garlic chicken and sweet n sour chicken. We all shared. It was as fresh as can be. Clean restaurant. Very suitable for all people. Warm and inviting."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated.  It is also quiet.  The service was good.  The wonton soup was good.  The moo shoo pork was okay.  The wraps were a little too tortilla like.  The Kung pao chicken was terrible.  Oily with not much flavor.  The pot stickers were okay.   Probably won't come here again as nothing I've had so far warrants a return visit and I'd be worried about a repeat of the Kung pao chicken - truly terrible."}
{"text":"Better than average. Took some to my hotel, first time there. Very pleased. They actually had a little heat in the dishes that were supposed to have it. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Have picked up take out 3 times now and the food is consistently good.  It's not overly salty like most others.  Inside is very clean and the people at the counter are always very nice!   Singapore noodles could be a bit more spicy, but this shrimp is a good size and cooked perfectly!  I do wish they'd add a kids menu.  We have to order a full size noodles every time, but that just means left overs!!  I really hope this place sticks around for years to come.  It's great to have a little hidden gem in this part of town."}
{"text":"Damn good Chinese food.  Get the bourbon or sesame chicken.  That is all you need to know.  Seem to end up here every time my wife and I visit her family in Madison.  Take-out is easiest because the place isn't big but taste just the same fresh or 20 minutes old :)    Christmas Eve tradition includes a night of HKK, love that and this place cam facilitate the best.  Crab Rangoon and egg rolls are all above average."}
{"text":"My orange chicken was sticky with a gross flavor that made me wonder where the stickiness came from. My uncle really enjoyed his veggies though."}
{"text":"First visit, very good service and their food is fresh. Lunch is only $6. Includes soup, egg roll, crab puff and entree. Kung pao beef was very good!"}
{"text":"Aye the Mongolian beef lunch special. Fantastic, beware if you don't like onions. Hot and sour soup resounded. Clean, nice ambiance, friendly service, superb value!"}
{"text":"Went here again tonight for takeout. Got Phoenix and dragon. Had lots of large shrimp and plenty of chicken. Taste was excellent and there was plenty for me and a friend."}
{"text":"Their wonton soup with sirracha sauce cures cancer. It's that good I recommend to all"}
{"text":"Yummy food for a little strip mall shop. Used to go to another spot down the road but food has gradually declined. This place is good but the spicy options are not really spicy so have to add some at home. Been here 3 times and have had no complaints."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ate there last night and we liked it very much.  I am here from out of town to visit him while he is here working.  He told me this place had the best sesame chicken he had ever eaten in his life so I had to try it out.  It was delicious!  The restaurant was extremely clean and the people that worked there were very nice.  I would have given it 5 stars but their iced tea was not good and I am an ice tea freak so having good tea is really important to me.  But the food was yummy.  You should definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time last week. Will definitely return. I ordered the house chow mien lunch special. My total was $7 and some change and my plate included a cup of soup, an eggroll and a crab Rangoon. I was pleased when I counted 4 shrimp within my noodles, that's usually around the amount I get when I order a large chow mien. The chow mien was was excellent. The fried items were ok, not bad and not best I've ever had. Sadly I was not impressed with my hot&sour soup, it could've used more flavor for sure. The fried rice on the side was very basic brownish looking without any veggies. I took my food home but the inside of the restaurant was very clean with awesome South Mountain views."}
{"text":"Yelp took me to this place and it was pretty dang good. I would have given it 5 stars, but they got my order incorrect. Aside from that, the food was good and the service was great! I'll be going back again. Especially since they offer generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in south phx. They are legit. Had a craving but they were closing in 8 minutes and they still offered to take my order. That's awesome! Always friendly when I come in. Never had a bad meal from here. Check it out"}
{"text":"Best Asian cuisine in town!!  I love this place.  Never had a bad experience.  Love the shrimp with broccoli and wonton soup.  The fact that the kitchen is open to the public is great to me.  I love watching them cook on those giant woks!  Hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a authentic Chinese place on our way home from Costco and Yelp came to the rescue when we stumbled upon this hidden treasure closer to our West neck of the woods off Baseline. The staff was super friendly and inviting when we walked in. The booths were nice enough for date night. The variety was exceptional. We were ordering a Teriyaki Chicken and Happy Family Combo per reviewers recommendations which were around $10 and came with a egg drop soup, fried rice, crab puff and egg roll. Tons of food! The only thing we had hoped for was our East Coast Flashback with the little Chinese sign boxes that open and close on top for that official authentic touch but realized that the Styrofoam packaging maybe the new modern less drip option. Doh. Too bad. My happy family was yummy but just a little bland. The crushed red pepper sauce that came with to accompany did just the job to liven things up. Plenty of food for 2 meals and I would recommend even without the original wish list top closure boxes."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and walked over to grab a bite. I had eaten here before and was wasn't a huge fan. But a year as passed and so I gave it another try. We ordered the  Mongolian beef and chicken and shrimp. The Mongolian was pretty good. I liked the sauce with garlic and onions. The chicken and shrimp was a little sweet with carrots and cabbage and  Broccoli. Everything was tasty! Thumbs up guys, you did a great job. Portions were large as well, BONUS!"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service, and all at an excellent price. I am leary of trying new Chinese restaurants because of some bad experiences, but this was worth the risk."}
{"text":"Okay, here it is..  I ordered the moo goo gai pan (spell check?) with dumplings and that's it.  Overall, the food was good. The dumplings were on point. You know they are homemade when you see the cook preparing them! I was happy with that. The greens in my entree were green and fresh. One thing I appreciated was the fact that they make the food to order. My entree was supposed to be with mushrooms I asked for no mushrooms and that's what I got.    The server was well you can tell family but he did well kept our glasses full and he was attentive!  Definitely will be going back for more!   Also for those who are Paleo they have a lettuce wrap pretty cool!! I will have to try it!"}
{"text":"It's your ideal Chinese place. Went there for lunch, most meals are $5.95. The portions are very generous. The crab puffs appetizer were on point. I got sweet and sour chicken, was amazing. Gf got the shrimp vegetables and she killed the huge lunch portion."}
{"text":"Our first time here, believe me it won't be the last. Ordering was quick and on time. Friendly service.. Great Food"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the last 3 years on a weekly basis. The food is great, service is fast and the prices for lunch specials is a deal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant for Thai Pad.  The coconut shrimp is tasty but is different than the expected.  It maybe closer to Asian than the Asian-American we get.   When you are in Madison Indiana this would be an excellent choice."}
{"text":"The review from Shantel R. was NOT about Hong Kong Kitchen!  Their restaurant doesn't have carpet. It has wood floors. The Empress of China has carpet and serves duck. Hong Kong does not. I live in Madison and eat Hong Kong at least once a month-carry out. It is good food and reasonably priced. The egg rolls are crisp and usually packed with veggies. They are hand made so they do vary. The Kung Po chicken, General Tao, Veggie Lo Mein are all good. If you order the beef and broccoli be sure to state it clearly. They do have a tendency to mess that order up when ordering over the phone. Ready in ten minutes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very reasonable prices, and the best of all THE SERVICE!  I just move from Chicago an I really need to find a place like this!"}
{"text":"Large portion and speedy service. I almost always order the Mongolian beef combo and its consistently good."}
{"text":"As visitors to Madison, we were looking for an alternative to sandwiches and salads when we saw this place and thought we'd give it a try for Sunday lunch. My kids and I were satisfied with our plentiful and very reasonably priced meal. Is it the most amazing Asian I've ever had? Probably not. But it fits in that category of places I'd be comfortable to visit again. The service was cordial. We got a surprise of freshly fried dessert buns. Fun! By the way, I asked if they use MSG and got a confident \"no.\""}
{"text":"The price is decent and the food is decent. I honestly don't know of that many Chinese food spots in the nearby area of my house. It's only a mile away and is pretty consistent. I like the hot and sour soup from there."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry I did have the wrong place please disregard my previous review I feel so bad :("}
{"text":"Just not good  Today my lunch companion and I were  in the mood for Chinese cuisine so we thought we would give Hong Kong Kitchen a try.  I realized Hong Kong receives many positive reviews but to be honest, it just wasn't good, in my opinion. Maybe I caught them on an off day.  The service was good. We were seated immediately, given menus, and our beverages were served quickly. So we choose our entrees, Sweet and Sour Chicken and pork, eggrolls, crab puff, rice, and refreshments. Prior to our entrees we were given a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup, however I just didn't like the taste.   The portion sizes at Hong Kong Kitchen are large, and the prices are fair, however, the food just isnt very good. The taste of the of the sweet and sour chicken/pork was too sweet/salty, and the liberal usage of corn starch made for an unpleasant taste. Both our dishes were smothered in sweet & sour sauce, to the point of being soggy. The entrees just weren't good. The same could be said about the rice and eggrolls.  Maybe, I will revisit Hong Kong Kitchen, and give them another try, however, this visit wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I can't get into their Singapore Noodles, the one time I ordered looked NOTHING like some of these picks. I got a giant knot of fried noodles, dark brown and way to crisp for my taste. Not what I expected. I couldn't even pull them apart. Other than that, I've gotten the lunch combos and they seem decent. Fair prices."}
{"text":"I only ordered takeout from here so I can't comment on the service part of this restaurant. The food however is great! The portion sizes were pretty huge and easily made two meals.   My only complaint is when we went to pick our food up after ordering over the phone, there was a man at the counter ordering takeout as well who happened not to have called ahead and also wanted $150 worth of food. My food was ready and bagged up on the counter but I had to wait behind the hungriest man in America to decide on his order before they gave us our food. I get that it was just an unfortunate circumstance, but there were a lot of employees there and any one of them I'm sure could have just run my credit card and handed me my food in 30 seconds or less.   I'll definitely go back and sit down at a table next time. I live less than a mile away so I'm excited to go again and maybe have a better experience."}
{"text":"I\"m in agreement with the others here.  The food was so good here.  Our waitress could not have been more pleasant and helpful, constantly refilling drinks for a table of 6.  She even offered to give us new drinks in to go cups.  The food really is delicious here.  We tried everything from beef and snow peas, to orange chicken, to chow mien and lo mien.  It was all yummy.  We even liked the open and airy atmosphere.  It's not particularly inventive cuisine--hence the 4 instead of 5 stars--but it's really good and their customer care is warm and efficient."}
{"text":"So I have visited a few times after my last review, and let me tell you I'm a little addicted. There service has been great recently. I tried there CURRY CHICKEN IT WAS AMAZING! I love that they have Chili Oil."}
{"text":"Great  authentic food & prices. Service is also fantastic; it's a family affair. Hurray for good restaurants in this area as they are scarcer than rain!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese we know of in South Phoenix. Very clean inside, nice people very welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent value for price, the food itself isn't going to win any awards but it's still tasty. I haven't seen someplace that comes close to the quantity of food and flavor at a similar price point. Decided to try this place on a whim for lunch with some coworkers when we were sick of panda express and wanted cheap Asian food. Don't think we will ever go back to panda when this is nearby! If you're arriving for lunch, don't bother opening the menu, just flip it over to its back and pick a low price lunch special, they also have $1 combo addons for an egg roll, ream cheese Rangoon, and egg drop soup ($1 more to upgrade the soup to a different one). The waitress also spoke good English and we had no trouble communicating our order. The place is not crowded, even during peak lunch hours, which is a real surprise to me, so not much noise. Actual restaurant and tables/seats were clean when we went, my only real complaint is that their tap water isn't very good, but at the price point I wouldn't expect anything better."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a hot and sour soup guru!!!!  This is good but more of a beef based soup with some hell fire kick to it!!  The sour is lost somewhere in the hell fire!!!  It's not bad, just different!!  Crab Rangoons are the bomb!!!  Orange chicken just ok!!  I'm hoping that the fortune cookie says \" Johnny Depp soon be your pool boy!\""}
{"text":"It was super good... excellent service too. 100% great .....egg roll good and sour soup too... crab puffs is to die for"}
{"text":"This family owned business it really awesome, quick and awesome service, and clean environment.  The food is good, it did the job. I noticed that it wasn't as greasy compared to other chinese food places. I had a family style dinner with my wife and it came with 3 appetizers, a soup, and 2 entrees and a dish of rice for 11 bucks a person. It was an awesome deal, and we had left overs for the next 3 days. Would come back"}
{"text":"Had the Hot and Sour soup and Kung Pao platter with pork fried rice. The soup was very good and probably the hottest (spiciest) version I ever had. The Kung Pao was also good with shrimp, scallops and chicken. Also quite hot as it should be. Maybe a little heavy on the sauce and salt, but enjoyable.   They do a lot of takeout, and the decor was quite plain. Recommended."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the prior reviews for helping me find this gem.  Never would have thought such a flavorful clean oriental restaurant would be residing so close to home.  This what I have waited years for...good fresh take-out.  Added plus is the prices are great and variety amazing.    The curry chicken was the best I've found since it wasn't just 3 ingredients like most (chicken, onions and potatoes).  It had water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, carrots, mushrooms, green peppers, onions and plenty of super thin sliced chicken breast.  The chicken teriyaki (which I requested the sauce on the side for my daughter) was amazing.  It was probably two chicken breast lightly battered and fried served over steamed cabbage, carrots and broccoli with white rice.  A super delicious healthy meal for a 7 year old.  My husband really enjoyed the Kung Pao Broccoli.  It had a lot of chili peppers, peanuts and a ton of broccoli.  The $1 to make a combo (egg roll, crab rangoons and soup) is great deal since I plan to eat my soup and leftover curry for lunch tomorrow.  Can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Hong Kong kitchen where do I start, it's fucken delicious!!! The food the employees it's all great hardly ever busy so good to come in at anytime. The texture and flavor of the food is mouthwatering and savor full one if the sweet and sour shrimp looks like a narwhal but other than that come here guys it's pretty ghetto you'll see people yelling at each other but it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This place was just okay to me. Food is good and the service is excellent. I had the kung pao chicken and the servings are HUGE!! Not satisfied enough to come back."}
{"text":"another great experience at hong kong kitchen. love the non buffet Chinese experience."}
{"text":"Went to Madison on Friday to hike in Clifty Falls. It was a late lunch but decided to eat at Hong Kong kitchen. The restaurant is right in old town Madison on the main street. Inside it is very clean. You order at the window in the back as you overlook the entire kitchen and watch your food being made to order. The food selection is excellent and varied. The taste and quality is good to very good. The lunch special runs from 11-3 and is a very full plate of one entree and rice. Their specialty is pork fried rice. Had egg drop soup that was excellent. For only $5.75, it is a lot of food. This place is a solid performer that i recomend. While we there it seemed a lot of locals are there."}
{"text":"The food was freaking delicious oh my goodness totally impressed reminding me of a real authentic Chinese restaurant used to visit growing up in Seattle minus the ones I would go to when I was living on east coast.........so fabulous ordered Singapore noodles they where amazing................OMG by the way the owner supersweet he noticed I was waiting in my car for my food to be ready.........he actually brought my food out to the car and said enjoytotal best curbside service ever....... thanks Hong Kong kitchen"}
{"text":"Feel like wasting money on bland over-priced \"food\"? Want your meal to come in a box held together with masking tape? Then, yep - you guessed it - this is the place to go.   The rice that comes with the combo meals has nothing in it. The eggrolls just suck and the teriyaki chicken was lacking in flavor. The vegetables were also too crunchy. (For this kind of meal, I prefer them soft!) The sweet and sour chicken I ordered tasted less like chicken and more like fried matter with a vague chicken flavor.  Oh Taste of China, how I miss you back in NC!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. We highly recommend. Triple delight, General Tso's and egg rolls and fried rice were all as they should be. Plenty of left-overs that we should have eaten tonight instead of going to 62 Twist."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!! I'm wicked picky with my Chinese and this is the closest to east coast Chinese I've had since moving to AZ from Massachusetts.  Try it you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chinese food but my family is, so I thought I would give it a try. I was very impressed, the food is perfectly and seasoned just right. The beef and broccoli was amazing and the rice was just right. I will be back and to try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"Is pretty much the same old Chinese food you get anywhere else in the world. What makes this place good is that it's in the heart of old downtown Madison. I like and appreciate the face that they had mu shu and I wished I would have noticed that they had pad Thai. Chinese food places are like gas stations on that you go there for the same thing without really expecting much deviation. For this location, this type of place has a definite purpose and they serve it well."}
{"text":"Really good food and quick service!  I'll definitely come back.  This area is sort of a dead zone for decent restaurants, so this is definitely one to note.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is that they give you what is presumably the Chinese equivalent of chips and salsa.  They set out a bowl of the little chip-like cracker things.  I am forgetting the name right now.  Wontons maybe?  With that pink sweet and sour type sauce normally served with egg rolls.  So good!  I hope this catches on everywhere, because it is a great idea!!  Both of our meals were HUGE and really, really delicious.  I got the vegetable delight, and my date got the thing with egg chunks.  Both were really, really good!    Service was friendly and very fast.  I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This is our go to for cheap Chinese take out. Typical Chinese take out. I like the egg rolls and crab rangoon better than other places around though. Always quick, friendly and fresh.  I see the other review said they forgot about her and never delivered....I did get there once and have to wait a half hour for food because, I guess they forgot me. I just popped into Family Dollar right next door to kill some time. We keep going because we like the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely DO NOT order from here. We ordered for the first time last night after hearing they delivered to Tremont. We called at 7:38 and were told it would be 45 minutes to 1 hour. After 1 hour and 15 minutes we called. Without saying hello someone screamed in the phone \"it's on its way\" and hung up. My husband called back again to see when it would be arriving and he was hung up on again. I called then and asked to speak to a manager and the woman on the phone who we had now spoken to multiple times just kept saying \"I don't know English\" when I was asking questions. There was someone speaking clear English behind her and I asked to talk to him and he also pretended not to speak English. Our food arrived almost two hours after we originally called after two more calls from my husband. The delivery person was the man who was speaking in the background so clearly the food was not on it's way after 1.5 hours nor had it been cooked. It is completely unacceptable to run a business and pretend not to speak English.  Also, the food was decent (compared with other limited options) but obviously not worth a 2 hour wait and being hung up on multiple times."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, but was not impressed. We ordered Kung pao and spring rolls to split. The chicken and rice were ok, but the veggies were way undercooked and the rolls were just odd. We are glad we didn't have to pay much, because we let feeling like we needed another dinner."}
{"text":"Great people, great food and decent prices. I definitely recommend the chicken Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Don't know why so many folks rated this place as a 4  star restaurant! In my opinion I have had better Chinese food here in Phoenix!!  Their butterfly shrimp had too much batter and the vegetable egg roll was bland and lacked taste!!"}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced, the food was good, the service was great and FAST!  I had the Vegetarian chop suey and my sister had the orange chicken. Both very yummy."}
{"text":"Craving some Chinese food wasn't too sure where we go look up on Yelp and found Hong Kong. Walked in place is very clean the staff was very friendly and cordial. The food was surprisingly very good tasteful. Love the orange chicken and house fried rice . I will be back again !"}
{"text":"Food was good service even better nice,clean, quiet atmosphere. Portion size was good. Food came out in a timely matter.Down side only one person working so waited just a little while to be seated and put my order in but it wasn't to bad"}
{"text":"The service fast and friendly for sure. The food was great. I had house special fried rice.  The flavor was perfect and not oily."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and I loved it. The service was awesome, super friendly! The food was amazing."}
{"text":"Had a craving for noodles and thought I'd try this place again. No bueno. The shrimp lo mein noodles lacked flavor, no seasoning to this dish. I also ordered a teriyaki chx. They have changed the recipe since the last time I tried this dish. Now it is heavily breaded-see photo and over cooked. So sad. I have tons of leftovers-for the feral cats outside my door. The best part of the meal was the egg roll and puffs. This is prob the last time I will eat from here so disappointed."}
{"text":"It pains me to give these guys three stars, but it really is a perfectly good 3-star place. I'll probably come back for more, but our most recent visit was entirely mediocre (in an entirely comforting sort of way). Hong Kong Kitchen would likely remind you of similar restaurants in cities where casual Chinese-American places are more the norm, but I'm usually looking for something a little more exciting when I see the ratings that this place has received.  In short, my egg rolls were a little burned on the outside and soggy on the inside, and most of our other dishes were quite average, but with generous portions and entirely edible. I'm pleased to have a pleasantly unspectacular Chinese takeout restaurant nearby and will come back for more, but my expectations will be lowered from what I had seen on yelp prior to my last visit, which was my first."}
{"text":"We stopped in while waiting for our service at Big O to be done. It's a great \"hole in the wall\" Chinese place! Prices are fair, and the sheer amount of good makes it a great value. Place was a clean, and staff friendly & attentive. Would have given it a 5 but the oil the fried portions were prepared in was old and it showed in the taste. The non-fried food was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. You get a huge amount of food and not only is the food great but the prices are great too. My new favorite dish is the Singapore noodles and for $1.00 more I got soup, rice, a egg roll, and 2 cream puffs. Can't beat that...and the service is awesome. Nice family owned restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from HKK for years. Don't expect a quick delivery or a fantastically spotless store. However, they're quick, and the food is top notch. The wonton soup is better than places I've had in Chinatown in NYC and I love the Beef Lo Mein and Singapore noodles. Nice people and super affordable. If you're looking for a quick bite to pick up for carry out on the cheap, this place won't do you wrong!"}
{"text":"We dined recently and frequented their previous location in Gilbert. Fast, friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"we love this place and the family who runs and owns it are amazing. best chinese in phoenix duck is awesome food quality outstanding marc evy hamzah syaffia 5 stars"}
{"text":"Garlic chicken YUM.  also be careful if you oder a large soup :-)  I will definitely come again.  Next time I am trying their Thai.  The wait staff was very professional, polite, and quick.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Service is great but you will spend a lot of time trying to find the meat in the breading. I got the Sesame Chicken and the breading is so hard it's a good thing I did not get the food to go because I am sure a plastic fork would break trying to stab it. It's unfortunate because the sauce was delicious. The fried rice was better than Pandas and other such places. I think from a flavor standpoint they could have a home run (or at least a triple) if they figure out their breading issues and focus on the actual meat being the hero of the dish."}
{"text":"Ordered the lemon chicken and the sauce tasted like some type of lemon cleaner rather than a lemon sauce, my mom ordered the shrimp fried rice and the shrimp was rubbery."}
{"text":"I eat here weekly if not once every 2 weeks. The photos on yelp was not flattering but I decided to give it a try and this has become one of my favorite restaurants. The orange and sesame chicken is the best dishes by far.  Don't rely on the reviews with this one. Try it out. Only negative no online menu so you will have to make a trip and order and grab a few menus to take home. The wait time has always been less than 15-20mins."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Wish we would've found them sooner! Great food, low prices, friendly service, nice atmosphere. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great price and presentation but the beef isn't crispy enough and the sauce is very sticky almost gummy like. I would come back but maybe try a different dish. Soup was good but watery , as well as the hot mustard both just seemed watered down. Good vibe very nice staff and clean. Overall not terrible but not 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"The services was great but the meal was not as expected.  Was supposed to be spicy and hot.   It was neither. I ended up spicing it up when I got home.  I heard the place was good so don't let this review stop you.  The person that referred me likes the place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, especially for the price.  The customer service was fantastic."}
{"text":"We have been here two times in the last couple months. The food is fantastic, the dining room is clean and tastefully decorated, and the staff is wonderful. Also, amazing value. For just $1 more than your entr√©e you will receive crab rangoons, spring roll, and delicious egg drop soup.   This is my favorite Chinese place in the Laveen/south mtn area by far."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town.  Served hot from the kitchen.  Not a buffet but plenty on your plate.  I usually take part of mine home.  It warms up and still tastes very good.  Their sauce is better than King Buffet on the hilltop by far!!! Owners fix to please your special requests Everyone is friendly and very fast.  Recommend  this establishment for satisfying meal.  Lunchtime is the best bargain."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here this week...it's that good!! My partner loves the sesame chicken. I've had Kung Pao chicken and KP shrimp. Both were excellent. Hot & Sour soup is out of this world delicious.   Service is great and we will be eating here frequently."}
{"text":"This place is our new go to spot for Chinese. The staff is always kind, the quality is fresh, and constant. We really enjoy their House Fried Rice but love their Walnut Shrimp one of the best in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Love the hong kong kitchen !! Very fast & courteous If you eat in enough, they pay attention to what you dont eat & the next time you order theyll adjust your meal to accommodate your tastes....ex. They noticed i picked out the bigger chunks of peppers...   The next time i ordered ,they cut them up smaller  My daughter picked out all the carrots from hers, next visit they omitted carrots from her dinner  they are just AWESOME"}
{"text":"Our first try - we had takeout. It was wonderful, quick and reasonably priced. The Szechuan Shrimp was great and the Mu Goo Gai Pan was also good. Very good Hot and Sour soup too. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The lady at the counter is friendly and the food is great. You can order non-spicy version of foods if you're not into spicy foods. The place is run by folks from Hong Kong as I understand it, and the food is prepared by Chinese cooks so you won't get overly Americanized food, which is awesome for me.  It's never crowded, which is a mystery. Maybe it's too far for those who appreciate Chinese food...? It's unfortunate. I grew up in various places in Asia so I like the fact that there is a good Chinese restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"My first time eating here and I was not disappointed!  I had the broccoli beef and it was delicious, flavorful! A nice clean and quiet place to enjoy some good Chinese food. The service was excellent.. I will definitely be back!"}
