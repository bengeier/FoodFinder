{"text":"Was my favorite place in town for sushi rolls for the last 5 years. My wife and I would get take out from there probably about once a week.  But unfortunately, lately they have not been as good. The quality has definitely lost some ground in the last year or so. It is Not the same product we fell in love with. Please change it back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome!   Good value for food compared to others.  Fresh!  

Would have given 5 stars but had to wait 15-20 mins for tempura when we pre-ordered for pick up.  Found that exceptionally long.

Staff were super friendly!"}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to order sushi on my own, I went to Misato since I lived closeby.  Let's face it, sushi can be a little intimidating for a newbie!  But the service was so friendly and accomodating - I was just getting take-out and the server helped me with my choices and welcomed me to sit down.  

The sushi was great!  This is where I first fell in love with yam tempura rolls.  The California rolls were a nice twist on the typical kind; they were more of a minced crab salad then a chunk of crab wrapped with cucumber/avacado.  The ingredients are fresh and you can watch them make the sushi, which is always nice right?  No hidden happenings.  

I've since moved and haven't been to Misato in a few months but I can't wait to go back and explore other sushi options!"}
{"text":"I have only dined here once, but the combination of dishes we ordered on that particular night were exceptional.   We were quite simply blown away by the food - with the standout, for me, being the \"Spicy Tuna Sashimi.\"  

The sauce in that dish was unique, and extremely flavourful.  I give big props for something that doesn't taste identical to every other restaurant.  

In fact, all the dishes, compared to their peers at other restaurants, had a little something special about them.   At least it seemed so on our visit.  

However, pricing seemed to be a little higher than comparable dishes elsewhere.  It's a consideration, but I think you get what you pay for sometimes.

Atmosphere-wise, the restaurant seemed especially quiet.  Even for a weeknight.  Not a lot of pop or vibe to it.

Still, very enjoyable.  I came to eat a great meal, and I was not disappointed. 

And upon reflection afterwards, a big intangibles jumped out as well:  convenience.  

My usual sushi standby is in Kensington, which I visit fairly regularly for lunch.  But I never bother going there for dinner.    

Why?
  
Well, if something is too much of an ordeal, I really can't be bothered.  And the parking situation in Kensington quite often sucks.

So a GOOD sushi restaurant next to adequate parking is welcome for someone like myself.     As I have been known to say, \"minimum effort, maximum gain.\"  

Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 26/30"}
{"text":"As there was a large selection of items on the menu, we asked our server what they recommended. It was suggested that each couple to order at least 2 Maki Sushi (Rolls) options, and if we wanted maybe some Nigiri Sushi (raw fish on top of rice), or Sashimi (raw fish). So our group agreed that it was a good idea, and that we would probably have more than enough food to eat. Maki Sushi ranges from 5 pcs to 8 pcs and are no more than $12, Nigiri came as 1 pc and the price ranged from $2 to $5 a piece. 

We had 4 couples (8 people) and each couple ordered 2 Maki Sushi options. We ordered 2 Sashimi Specials for $27 each and each plate comes with 17 pcs. Our group also ordered some Nigiri options, a total of 6 pieces from what I remember, and only a few ordered Miso soup before the meal. We also found that the portions were a good size. We have been to places where the portions are so tiny that you end buying too much. Then we have been to a place (Towa) where the portions are huge and for a first timer you end up having left overs. We think the portion sizes from Misato are just right.

The freshness of the fish was excellent! It wasn't too cold as if it were just taken out of the freezer, and not too old that it would give you an after-taste. It was pretty darned perfect in our opinion. We can't remember all the options we had but one thing that did stand out was the spicy options we picked. Sometimes places have a hard time gauging how spicy they should make their food. In our personal opinion when it comes to sushi it should never be too spicy. The hero of the piece should be the fish, with the spices simply complementing the fish. In the case of Misato they make it so you can taste the spice, but it doesn't hinder the taste of the fish. It is very balanced and leaves your taste buds wanting more. As for the Sashimi special, beware sushi newbies that the combination is pre-selected (so you do not have the option to pick what comes in it). It comes with your common Red Tuna, White Tuna, Salmon but it also had what looked like octopus, scallops, and crab. The last three are more challenging to eat, if you know what mean. One thing our group noticed was the Wasabi. Normally we are used to a thick green paste, but in this case it was runnier and were told this was because it was freshly grated when prepared. 

All in all, it was a good experience and each couple paid no more than $50. We give it a 4 out of 5 and we will be revisiting it over and over."}
{"text":"Totally fresh, and the service is really good despite the fact that it is usually full.  Try the misato roll, delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The sushi is always very fresh and you can't go wrong with the prices. I don't eat a lot of sushi in Calgary but this place is almost as good as places on the west coast. The blush roll is amazing."}
{"text":"We love Misato. Great for work lunches and family meals. Best sushi in town. Spicy roll, house salad and some Kalbi makes for a great meal. A weekly stop for us."}
{"text":"I have friends who live by this place and every time I am in town, this is where we eat.  Creative menu items, friendly staff and some really good sushi.  What a difference quality makes."}
{"text":"I live right next to this particular establishment and I find myself there quite often. Location has little to do with it however. I go so much because the sushi is simply fantastic quality! In fact, I would say without hesitation that it is the finest quality Calgary has to offer sushi lovers.

There is a potential downside, and also my reason for not rating it 5 stars: the price. What was that saying? \"You get what you pay for\"? That's pretty much the deal here.

But indulge yourself some time! You wont regret it."}
{"text":"I think Misato is one of the best Japanese restaurants in town. They do a great job of their sushi - and the rice is always perfect. Everything we've ordered outside the sushi is also done at a very high standard. I really like their Sunomono. If you enjoy octopus I'd recommend it. Their mackerel is also very good."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in calgary for those who KNOW what good sushi is. It's not full of, over the top, fancy rolls, in fact the menu is rather basic. But the rice is PERFECT, and their spicy sauce for the spicy tuna appetiser and the spicy seafood rolls is one of the best dishes in ANY restaurant in Calgary. I always say if you're entertaining clients, take them to globefish or blowfish for the atmosphere and the fancy rolls that look like art. But for PERFECT sushi....go to misato"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places to get sushi! Price is fair for the amount of sushi that goes into the rolls. Our family usually comes once a week or so. Servers are friendly and kind, they are also patient as sometimes our orders are longer. The place isn't too big but the atmosphere is friendly. 

Weekly specials are a must as it's always something new and it's changed often. Sometimes the news rolls are so amazing that it's a shame to change it again the next week.  There's also promotions sometimes that they have when it's a holiday. I remember for Canada day, they had the order $50 and get a $5 coupon. 

Sushi rolls comes out pretty quickly. Sashimi are always fresh especially the salmon.  Some favourites rolls to order are salmon mango roll, volcano roll, sp. dragon roll, Hawaii roll. Kitchen order might take a little bit longer but it's totally worth the wait. Tonkatsu and tempura are crispy and crunchy as always. Golden sweet shrimp is a must try for anyone interested. 

Overall, great place to dine in or take out. Food is fresh and prefect."}
{"text":"I like this place, although a little pricier than some of the other Japanese restaurant's. On this particular visit, I came for lunch. They have a few different options at this time. 11:30-2, and if you have $11.95 in your pocket you can choose from two different \"Bento\" boxes labeled A & B. The first comes with either chicken or beef teriyaki, a small salad with a house dressing, 4 California rolls, 3 tuna rolls, edamame beans and tempura. Oh yeah, the meal starts with a bowl of miso soup. So nothing extraordinary here, sure the flavors are good but the prices compared to other Japanese restaurants like I said earlier are higher. In conclusion, I would come back, and yes I have been here before. I am a regular, no. I might be if I lived closer. Also I would like to add, that the establishment itself is clean. I have to say that on each occasion that I and my family have visited it is fairly well maintained."}
{"text":"I quite like this place. I met up with three other friends here for sushi one night. The restaurant is a bit \"out of the way\" from where I'd usually go, but it's one of the few places that seems to have figured out the balance between \"how fast the chefs can prepare the food\" and \"how long the tables wait for their order\". They are not a large restaurant, and the layout is not crowded.

On occasion, I don't mind paying a bit more for sushi if the quality of it is better as a result. These guys have that - extremely good sushi (especially for Calgary). The plates were excellent, well presented, and incredibly delicious. The service and food were both excellent.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna roll i've ever had. The large cuts of tuna and something about the sauce make it pretty amazing."}
{"text":"So far most authentic Japanese in town to me, the Japanese manager (or owner) is very friendly and provides good recommendation. The cut of sashimi was really clean! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"#121 I guess I lucked out, based on the most recent 2 star review.

Arrived at 8:45pm Thursday. Seated promptly and a nice waitress within 2 minutes. Service is kicking it for me.

Hey Rocky, watch me pull a roll out of my hat... Again?

I only had the Rocky Roll since I am going to Sakana Grill for Happy Hour in a few but wanted to try a new sushi place. After watching \"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, this is part of my last 24 hours before my REBOOT. 

Recommended rolls:

Rocky Roll contains tuna, green onions, avocado wrapped in smoked tuna.

Pinky Roll is Rocky Roll but trade the word tuna for salmon.

Bookmarked and returning soon.

Domo Arigato, Misato."}
{"text":"Understaffed and incompetent staff. Hostess and waitresses here are very disrespectful in welcoming, seating, and serving. The restaurant is often busy and the staff take it as an excuse to provide a rushed and poor level of service with an arrogant attitude.

Called to make a reservation today but failed to get an answer after many trials, so went ahead and went to the restaurant. Was asked if I had reservation after being ignored at the door in the beginning, and when I said no one answers the phone to make reservations, their excuse was 'well we are very busy today'. In the end I was asked to come back in an hour for a table. Took what I got of the fantastic service so far and left to never return again."}
{"text":"We go to this place a lot! The food is always fresh, fast and tasty. The pricing is reasonable and the service is great.  
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tasty!

BBQ Salmon Skin...5 stars.  Excellent!!!  Almost anything fatty that's grilled is good!  This is no exception.  Sliced salmon skin with a bit of meat is nicely charred and flavorful.  Next time I'll have to ask for sauce on the side...I prefer the natural taste of the skin and have the option of dipping the sauce.  Also, the sauce tends to soften up the skins.  Otherwise, an excellent dish.

Grilled Salmon Collars/Cheeks (Hamachi Kama)...5 stars. Pork chop-sized salmon collars perfectly grilled to order. There is absolutely nothing better than grilled food! The meat on these collars are super tender and gelatinous!!! Be forewarned, though, as there ARE a few pin bones by the cheeks and larger ones around the collar...nevertheless, this is not a dish to be gorged upon but rather enjoyed pleasurably.

BBQ Black Cod...4 stars. Three won ton-sized black cod collars for $17.95, plus sides. Based on price, alone, this dish would get 1 star. However, the collars are perfectly grilled. If you prefer a more intense fish flavor then this dish is for you. Due to their diminutive size, there's very little meat on the collars but plenty of crispy and gelatinous goodness. You'd REALLY have to like cod collars to order this dish. I, myself, prefer salmon collars for their lighter taste and bigger portions.

Agedashi Tofu...5 stars.  If you like tofu, you'll certainly enjoy this dish.  The deep-fried tofu has an amazingly light crust.  Coupled with its soft interior, it makes for an interesting meal. The dish, itself, looks quite elegant (magazine worthy). The tentsuyu broth is very light and a great pairing to the even lighter tofu.  Be careful with the minced ginger garnish, as it can be overpowering (I simply brushed it aside).

Yakitori (Chicken Skewers)...5 stars.  Nicely grilled cuts of chicken and scallions. The teriyaki sauce is light and flavorful.  They're not glamorous, but these are as good as any chicken skewers you'll ever have at a Japanese establishment.

Vegetable Tempura...5 stars.  Evenly coated assortment of thinly sliced vegetables, such as, yams, bell peppers and zucchini, as well as, whole asparagus.  The vegetables are fried to perfection. Can't ask for more than that. ;)"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant by far. I've been going here since I was a little kid and nothing compares. Awesome service and friendly staff. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've actually gotten takeout from Misato before but was not that impressed with my meal that one time, so I decided to dine in and see if it was any different.

Bento Box B with Beef - $12.95

Comes with standard tasting miso soup.

In this bento box you get sashimi, tempura, teriyaki beef (choice of chicken or beef), a small salad and edamame.  I was surprised that rice is not included as most places do include it.  The sashimi was so creamy and smooth - definitely fresh! The tempura was a bit greasy and I wish they gave you a larger salad.  Edamame was pretty standard since it was just simply boiled.  The teriyaki beef with veggies would've been better with a bowl of rice as it was on the sweet side.

Calgary Special Roll (1/2) - $11.95

The famous Calgary Special Roll.  Since I know so many people rave about it, I decided to try it myself and was very happy they offered a half portion of it b/c there is no way I can eat the bento box and the full eight pieces.  So now that I've tried it... I am not sure why people like it so much.  I was expecting different varieties of fish, but there's only tuna, salmon, masago, shrimp and fake crab meat inside the roll, and there's a thin slice of smoked salmon on the outside.  Mind you there's a lot of fresh fish inside, but the ingredients are nothing special.  This is just a house special roll on steroids.  Before Sushi Kawa went downhill, their house special roll was way better since there's more variety of fish offered in it.

Overall my meal was satisfactory but I definitely don't see myself driving all the way down here too often.  Service was pretty decent and prices are average to a bit high depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Really, really overpriced and poor quality. Completely disappointing. $60 for 4 pieces of sashimi, 4 pieces of nigiri sushi, some cucumber rolls and \"spicy\" tuna rolls slathered in mildly spicy sauce? Complete rip off. Will never order from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Love sushi? I'm willing to bet you'll love Misato too!

My wife and I have been eating at Misato for a few years now. We love it. 

The sushi is amazing. Sashimi - amazing. I think there's other food on the menu but to be honest I've never even looked. Bring the sushi and keep it coming!

I really don't known what else to say.

Oh... I know what else, great variety of rolls and a healthy portion size too. None of this teeny weeny bit of tuna surrounded by a thimble of rice and some sea weed. No no no... portions sizes are generous.

My brother-in-law was visiting from Vancouver and we took him and his wife to Misato. 

\"What do you think Rob... how does it compare to your Vancouver sushi?\"

Rob, \"Wow, that's pretty good. It's better than a lot of places I've ate at in Vancouver!\"

I'm sure it's simple logistics. Catch a salmon. Kill it. put it on ice, Fed/Ex it to Calgary same day and serve it up that night... from ocean to belling in 48 hours max. Works for me.

So, what are you waiting for. Looking for a great sushi? Try Misato! You better make a reservation though because I've never been able to just show up and get a table. They take reservations on a Friday and Saturday night too - a lot of places don't... eg: the Keg Steakhouse.

The staff are very good and you can see the sushi cheff's prepare it too. Kind of cool.

They do take-out as well - give them about 45 minutes to an hour to be ready for pick up so call before you head home and pick it up on the way.

Cost? My wife and I will polish off  $40-$50 in sushi and we're stuffed to the gills!

So why not four stars? 

It's a bit small and in the winter, it gets a little chilly due to one door opening all the time, not an inner & outer door. 

They charge a .50 cent service fee to use your debit card. It's not a big deal financially, it's just the principle of it all. It's the cost of doing business (for them - not me)

These really aren't deal breakers for me - my wife gets a chill easy and I would rather not be charged a service fee to use my debit card - that's just me though.

Enjoy the Rocky Roll! I bet you can eat just one!"}
{"text":"Could have been better. No complaints about the food - we got the sushi boat and a spider roll to share as a family. The service was friendly and prompt, but very inattentive once we had our food. Never got a water refill the whole time we were there. There were only customers at two or three others tables. When we asked if we could pack up the leftovers they brought a used styrofoam container (gross). Had to ask for another. The server dropped off the bill without any instruction about how to pay and never came back. I eventually had to go find someone to help me at the till."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in town.  I very much appreciate that each piece is made to taste good as a dish and not just stuffed with random fish. Other Japanese restaurants needs to take note, quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Huge pieces of sashimi and rolls. Not a lot of roll variety and prices are high, but really fresh."}
{"text":"I adore Misato - having lived in Vancouver for 4 years, I appreciate good sushi and it's hard to find in Calgary.

Granted, my sushi picks usually tend towards the \"safer\" stuff ;)

The service is always great, and the restaurant has just the right number of seats, in my opinion. Wait isn't usually that long.

The only disappointment thus far was the calamari roll - the calamari was chewy and we ended up discarding half the roll. I love calamari - and this wasn't it :/

Otherwise, I'd say Misato is a little pricey but it's what you'll have to pay for excellent sushi in Calgary.

I've been many times and will be back, of course.

{"text":"Been coming here for over a decade! Not as good as it used to be, but it's still a great little place in the burbs for sushi."}
{"text":"Second time reviewing misato. Came here hoping that our first experience was an anomaly but unfortunately we are now convinced that Misato is officially no longer what it used to be.  I believe that change in ownership/management is the main cause although I am not certain (I say this based on not seeing the familiar faces in the sushi bar) They've switched from quality to cost focused operations and it shows.

My fiance ordered bento lunch box and I got the nabeyaki Udon.  The bento box had sashimi pieces that were visibly low in quality than what it used to be. Also the nabeyaki Udon had 2 tiny pieces of chicken, size of my nail.  I believe that the point of nabeyaki Udon is to have various proteins in the Udon but clearly it wasn't the case (i.e. no crab stick).

Unfortunately this might be our last visit to Misato..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy having the Lunch bento box special here!  I've come here twice with my brother & his wife and they enjoy it as well.  Yesterday I took my husband for the lunch special and he was a happy camper too. 
The girls were friendly and service was fast!  We usually get the number B special and the sashimi is always so fresh & tasty .  The miso soup with the meal is very hot and full of flavour!  I love getting the edamame with my meal and the tempura is hot and crispy !  My teriyaki chicken set on a bed of sautéed cabbage is yummy!  You have to pay .50 for a side order of rice which I don't think you really need.  I'm always stuffed after all the food from this special !  This extra cost is for those who want rice .... they do this since a lot of rice is never eaten and is wasteful unless you really want to eat it.... I'm ok with that.  Wasteful is not a good thing."}
{"text":"Being asocial is a negative. I'd love to know more about the fellow yelpers, just so to understand how Misato could possibly get 4-5 stars.

Been there twice, one visit worse than another.

First time, they made us wait, though barely three tables were occupied in the whole place. The food was ok - nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain. Price tag was not really high, so I don't think that $$$ is entirely correct.

Second time, not only we've been waiting till another two tables, arriving after us, were served, but the food was simply not fresh - teriyaki beef barely warmed up in a microwave, mashed potato cold, and the whole lunch box was just from the fridge. This food was NOT prepared fresh - flat chinatown-quality stuff.

On the positive side, waitresses were always smiling, but missing to fill our cups with tea or respond fast - and, again, the room was never packed - just a couple of tables, so don't know what made them so busy as to be inattentive.

Resuming:

- Average to low quality food;
- Consistently long waiting times;
- Polite, but not helpful staff.

If anything seriously thinks that's a 4-5 that's ok, your mileage may vary - but in my book that's a 2-3. Period."}
{"text":"I have been to Misato probably 20 times which means I love it.  But last night I was very disappointed.  It just wasn't up to it's normal high standards.  The rice was too gooey and the beef in the Alberta roll was way over cooked.  It was more like a jerky roll.  And the rolls themselves were quite a bit smaller.  I am willing to give it another chance but gee, I hope it was just an off night for someone."}
{"text":"Okay, its my favorite sushi restaurant in town. The sushi is consistent in taste and quality. Service can be slow, but its worth it. Reservations are good to have, as it can be full 4 nights a week. Although I chance it 1/2 the time and get in within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be really good before it changed hands. My husband and I were there last night; only four tables were occupied. Server wasn't really paying attention and service was fair to bad. Edamame came at the same time as the entrees. 
I ordered a tuna-don which used to have big pieces of fish and a great presentation... now, not so much. Very thin pieces of fish, almost looks like sashimi. Presentation was terrible, two pieces of dry cucumber on top and that was about it. 
We had to ask the server to clear the dishes, had to ask for more tea. Another server stepped in and she was very good. 
Menu is not traditional Japanese food anymore, lots of items added which makes it obvious the owner is not Japanese.
Won't be coming back soon, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Still on the search for great sushi in Calgary!  This place is pretty close.  It's also run by Japanese which is key to success :)

Their rolls and sushi are quite consistent and the flavours are fresh.  They are quite uniform with their sashimi cuts as well.  They do put a good dollop of wasabi on their sushi so just a warning!

Their spicy tuna is awesome as well as their dynamite rolls!  Their prices are quite high in comparison but definitely worth it as they are true Japanese sushi chefs.

I've only ever done take out with them but they do seem to be quite busy in the restaurant at most times.  It's in a nice area and has a nice big parking lot.  If you get bored while waiting there's also a Sunterra to browse around in."}
{"text":"Still haven't found my favorite Japanese place for vegan food yet in the city, but this place is good.  I get so tired of going to Globe Fish that I was looking for somewhere else. 

It has a nice atmosphere and is clean and nice enough to go to for dinner. The menu has a decent selection of vegetarian items so that's appreciated. 

I don't live too far away so I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Excellent, really good food + great service. We will coming back soon to enjoy Misato sushi again."}
{"text":"I was a little pressed for time and I decided to get take out from this place as it was close by. I also had a $5 coupon so why not. I ordered with my eyes and got quite a lot of food to try out. I placed my order and when I went to get it, it wasn't until I got home when I realized that they forgot half my order. It was a bit of a pain to drive back as I was already running late, but it wasn't too far away. They apologized and said the kitchen must've not got it, but then my order was ready within 2 min? 

I wasn't overly impressed with the rolls I got. The \"spicy\" salmon roll wasn't spicy whatsoever and it made me think whether they even got the right order. I ate it anyway because it still tasted fine. The 2nd roll I got was supposedly a crunchy roll, as they had tempura bits in it, but the tempura bits were just overly soggy and not appetizing at all. I didn't even want to finish it because it was just the wrong texture all around. The sashimi tasted at least fresh so I didn't complain there. The gyoza and teriyaki chicken that they forgot initially felt like they simply heated up the chicken and slopped on some sauce and threw together the gyoza as they prepared in like 2 min. Overall, I was fairly disappointed and even more so with the fact that I had to return back a 2nd time to pick up the other half of my order."}
{"text":"Misato is our favourite sushi restaurant in town! We go for sushi at least twice a week and ever since we discovered Misato we've become completely hooked. We're definitely regulars here. 

Portion sizes are good but what we love is just how consistently fresh everything always is. Prices are a little on the high side however it's totally worth it!

We generally get takeout but anytime we've decided to dine-in we've never had to wait to be seated & the staff are always very friendly. I have a lot of allergies and they're always extremely attentive to make sure our needs are met."}

{"text":"It's taxing to find a great sushi restaurant in Calgary, but search no more because I've found it! I will never forget my first time at Misato. It was after a gruelling 4 hour hike in Kananaskis country with my aunt and her friends when we decided to reward our kick-ass selves with some good sushi. I was expecting the usual downtown venue but was happily surprised when J said 'she knew a place.' J is picky when it comes to food, particularly sushi since she is a frequent flyer to Hongcouver often eating the freshest of the fresh sushi. Plus, we have learned never to say no to J. 

We made reservations for 6:30 PM, which is highly recommended since the place is small and really busy especially on the weekends. Our party of 8 arrived and we each 'picked' a roll - J was really good at convincing us that the choice was indeed ours. Everything was fresh and tasted great but all else faded into the background when our server announced the arrival of the Calgary Special roll. I felt like all life form around me paused and the only thing in motion (slow mo, to be exact) was this plate of awesomeness. This was the mother of all sushi rolls! An approximate size comparison would be a coaster from your local watering hole; maybe even a bit bigger. I wish I had a picture of it but to paint you a picture, imagine if you will, the essence of good sushi - fresh salmon, tuna belly, advocado, smoked eel, crab meat wrapped in signature Japanese rice covered in smoked salmon. Mouth watering, I know! 

Above and beyond the delectable sushi, the service is great. Servers are always friendly and greet everyone with the same enthusiasm - sunshine and lollipops anyone? The decor is modern and tastefully Japanese. You won't find any of that cheesy, overly loud 'look at me, I'm an Asian food establishment' art here. The oversized leather chairs are welcoming making it a great place for long sittings. Misato would be an excellent choice for a first date, a small get together but any party over 6+ I would suggest finding another restaurant. But regardless, make a reservation. Oh and don't forget to try the Calgary Special roll!"}
