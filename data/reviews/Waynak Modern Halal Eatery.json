{"text":"They added a sign on their window that said \"FREE SOUP (for residents of the condo next door)\". I went in and inquired about this 'free soup' and the lady told me I had to buy something first. That felt a little deceitful since there was no mention of any purchase necessary. 

I then asked what their best dish was and she said \"everything\". Not a very good response when you're trying to figure out specifically what to get. I ended up getting the burger for $5.99 (no fries or drink included). It tasted like your typical store bought frozen burger patty. There are TONS of other restaurants around the area. Do not waste your money on average food and average service."}
{"text":"Great service, loved the hummus! Beet salad was great too. In from out of town and they were just opening up.  Fresh pizza (they say the dough is made daily). Lots of options for sodas/teas."}
{"text":"Awesome place:) Amazing Shisha and the Owner Sam is a great very professional and friendly person and very quick service and very reasonable prices. I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Chicken was slightly undercook however the shawarma was still filling and had good seasoning!"}
{"text":"There seem to be an exceptionally high number of fake Google reviews, but this place was good when I went.

Service was outstanding. The cashier took the time to explain how the meal pricing works. I had the beef kebab with rice and steamed vegetables. She had told me the beef kebab was the juiciest and it did not disappoint! The garlic sauce is made in-house and tasted great on the bed of rice. The steamed vegetables had the right level of moisture - not too dry and not soggy.

They also serve pizza. My guess is that they've taken over the pizza oven/equipment from the place that was previously at this location, but the pizza coming out of the oven definitely looked good.

{"text":"Yesterday, some of us at my office ordered from Waynak because one of us eats Halal. The food was plentiful in serving size and it was a very good value.

I ordered the Volcano pizza. Highly recommended if you like spicy - but not TOO spicy. It was just the right amount of heat. My co-workers were all satisfied as well. We look forward to ordering from here again."}
