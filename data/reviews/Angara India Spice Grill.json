{"text":"5 STARS . Excellent Service  It is a very GOOD place, Nicely Decorated. I tried the indian food for the first time and it was very delicious. Service was excellent and the waiter was Awesome with complete knowledge of food and spice levels. Astush (if I spelled it right) was our Server and was Super friendly. He recommended me the Chicken Tikka Masala for Medium Spicy and Lamb Vindaloo for my husband who wanted to eat spicy. Food was great and the Service made our night awesome. I would Recommend this place to everybody I know."}
{"text":"Went to lunch buffet. 

Good service. Good price. Average food. Cold buffet plates. Not a huge selection and food needed to be 10 deg F warmer."}
{"text":"Another non descript indian restaurant ...same menu same overcooked food. Sadly no indian restaurant does justice to indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews but this place missed on several points for me.  First off walking in I was nearly overwhelmed my the amount of incense in the air.  Way, way too strong!  

I tried several dishes and most were bit bad but my favorite, chicken tiki masala, was way too \"tomato-y\" for me.  

The only thing I will praise them on odd the nan was fresh and hot.  I just wish there was something worthy to dip it into!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and dining experience. Waiters were excellent from the time we came in until we left. We had butter onions which I have never tried and they are excellent, along with vegetable samosas. Sauces were awesome that were served with appetizers. Lamb korma was excellent and the rice. Garlic naan was so hot and fresh. If you like Indian food I definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you for the large portion sizes for take out, ordering two dishes I can feed my family who eats ALOT for two days!! Thank you for the being the best Indian food restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"The spices in the food make love to your senses without making you sweat.  Every dish was an explosion of complimentary flavors and warm textures.  I am addicted!
So glad i found this Gem!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord.  Where do I start.  We were on our way from Red Rock to Las Vegas strip.  Told the wife I wanted Indian, and this place had great reviews.  It did not disappoint...at...all.  Phenomenal.  Not only was it the best Indian I ever had it was the best food I've ever had.  10/10 friendliness, decor, service, food, prices. Every year I come to Vegas I will come here."}
{"text":"Great small Indian lunch buffet. The owner said the buffet changes daily. Today the buffet included Tandoori chicken, goat curry, Yellow Dal, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, vegetable Samosas, Palak Paneer, and more. It comes with freshly baked Japan, either plain or garlic. We enjoyed everything. Great location at the interaction of Flamingo and Grand Canyon, just off the 215."}
{"text":"Everything was very good.  We had the combination meat for two because it has all of our favorites.  Best Indian food in the area, just as good and better priced than Curry Leaf.  I will be back"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! 
ANGARA INDIA SPICE GRILL IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED!
We visited Angara India Spice Grill for lunch today, expecting to try out a new restaurant. Instead, we ended up leaving disappointed and angry. Here's the story:
Wife found a coupon on Restaurant.com for this place, which we'd never tried before. The coupon was for $25 (it cost $10), with a minimum purchase of $50. The net cost (in retail) to the restaurant amounts to $15.
Angara India Spice Grill is in a strip mall, near a Target store. There are at least two OUTSTANDING Indian restaurants in the neighborhood -- Curry Leaf and Mint. So, we were not exactly shopping for another Indian food place, but the coupon makes this worth a try for first-timers.
Reviews posted at the usual sites were positive. Good food, Clean place. Certainly, Angara was enticing for those who enjoy Indian cuisine.
We arrived at exactly 2:32 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Note the exact time, because it's important. The website and hours on the door are posted as LUNCH: 11 am -- 3 pm. So, we were 28 minutes prior to close. Dinner began at 5 pm.
We were seated and were told the coupon would not be valid. An Indian waiter, who presumably was also the owner-manager said the coupon did not apply to the lunch buffet. By the way, we were the ONLY CUSTOMERS in the restaurant.
We explained that we were not interested in the buffet. We planned to order off the menu and would gladly order $50 worth of food. The waiter-manager-owner stated firmly that we would not be able to order off the menu. We stated that we would pay dinner prices (even though the coupon made no distinction between lunch and dinner). Waiter-manager-owner-weasel then fabricated some tale that the \"lunch ala cart menu ends at 2;30.\"
Wait. So, the restaurant is open for lunch until 3 pm. But we can't order off the menu after 2;30. And, it's now 2:32.
Seriously?
I stand up in stunned silence and begin to march towards the front door. Wife, who can be just as much a bulldog as me if the wrong buttons get pushed, tells the waiter-manager-owner that we would have gladly taken lunch anyway we could get it, even off the buffet. The restaurant would charge us $50, get two new customers, and the waiter would even earn a $10 tip (20 percent). How the hell can they be TURNING AWAY customers? THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!
I was out to the parking lot and wife said she wanted to go back inside and tell him more of what she thought of this situation.  Wife went inside and explained that we'd become loyal customers of their competition Curry Leaf entirely because they offered a coupon for first-timers and that ended up producing perhaps 50-60 visits over the next three years. Don't they see the UPSIDE of offering a meal and honoring their own coupon?
Instead, they make up excuses. They don't list the details on the coupon. They even reinvent the hours of operation on the spot.
Of course, we are NEVER GOING BACK. They are history. Dead to us. To see a completely empty restaurant turn away two paying customers which guarantees them some profit along, with the upside of future loyalty, strikes me monumental stupidity.
This situation was handled very, very poorly. I urge others to avoid Angara India Spice Grill. Their word cannot be trusted!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I hit up this place for diner when family was in town last year and end-up dropping over $200 for dinner (7 of us) and it was worth every penny! The flavors...the spices...mmmm! I figured if dinner was that delicious then the lunch buffet would not disappoint- and the girlfriend agreed! One of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas"}
{"text":"The ambiance at the restraunt was very nice, and peaceful. I tried their mango lassi it was very watery, was hoping for a thicker, more flavorful lassi not worth 4.99. I also ordered the chicken biryani & Channa masala both spicyness level of 8. The biryani came at a nice big portion and very flavorful I could taste all the spices and I ate it with raita to mellow out the spicyness, however level 8 is not as spicy as you think! As for the channa masala it was so good! Probably one of the best I've had!! Very flavorful!! Had a chai tea for dessert but it doesn't come with sugar so add your own sweetness !!"}
{"text":"We now have a new favorite Indian restaurant. The food was especially good, particularly the samosas which were large and crisp. We eat a lot of Indian food, and this place is fantastic! We also loved the Bollywood films that were showing on the TVs. They have a lunch buffet, which we will have to come try soon. It is family owned, and the service was exceptional. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The best Indian meal we've had (and we've had hundreds!). I only wish they had one here in Michigan!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tiki masala and the tandoori chicken from the lunch buffet.  Both were tasty and slightly above average considering they came from a buffet were food tends to be less spicy and also has to be continuously heated for a while. I will be back to try some menu items and provide a review of those as well."}
{"text":"We had the dinner for two non-vegetarian.. it comes with garlic naan bread, butter chicken curry, 2 other vegie dishes, kabob, cinnamon rice and rice pudding desserts. Didn't expect that much food for $39. The curry was my favorite though it wasn't as spicy as you would expect on curry dishes but it was pretty good. The service was good. We might come back to try the buffet lunch."}
{"text":"I,ve came in the buffet for the first time today...and loved it..the naan and chicken tikka masala was one of the best ive ever had...our server(name MOTI) gave unforgettable service...he explained everything whatever they put in there buffet..due to my first visit ,it was really helpfull for me to know about there curry's.the restaurent was neat and clean from in side as well the outsite...will for sure ill be back again and i highly recommended this place for those who never had try indian food."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Best samosas I've ever had. Will go back many times. They also deliver through bite. I'll plan on that too."}
{"text":"The BEST Indian food and service in LV!!  Been to many Indian restaurants and every dish I order is phenomenal.  Owner very nice and often comes out to talk to us."}
{"text":"Really yummy food!
Awesome buffet with many vegetarian & meat options to choose from. 
I'm used to eating authentic indian food at home & have never been so impressed from a restaurant. Both for dinner & lunch buffet. 
Definitely will return on our next vegas trip!
Staff was very friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"This place is by all means the BEST indian restaurant in las vegas. I would highly revommend to come here if you are looking for great indian food. The staff is extremely friendly. They have a lunch buffet that is awesome. Tonight we came for dinner and got the non veg special. Its wonderful!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Wonderful selections (including two desserts) at the lunch buffet, nice atmosphere with soft music and Bollywood on two tvs that are off to the side. This is our first time coming (thank you Yelp for the recommendation!). The greeter was friendly, great service and awesome food! We will definitely recommend this place to our friends! I can't wait to bring my hubby here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, once for dinner and once during the lunch buffet. Dinner entrees can be ordered at different spicy levels and if you love heat this is the place. Everything was delicious, but the vegetarian dishes were particularly good. The meat dishes were all excellent and have to admit the goat dish was tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"I have ordered several time to-go. The food is really good, be careful when ordering the extra spicy- it is no joke."}
{"text":"Fantastic traditional Indian food. Great to eat in or take out. If you've tried all of the other Indian restaurants in town then you will be delighted with how authentic the flavor is. Staff super friendly too.  All well priced."}
{"text":"Great buffet! My favorite of all the Indian buffets in Las Vegas. Their kheer (rice pudding), Tikka Masala, goat curry, and eggplant dishes, and spinach (saag) are great. The saag is where they shine and it is spicier and has more kick than what I had at Taj Palace and that's a good thing because the saag at Taj palace is very bland compared to this! Also try the galub jamun... which is like super awesome pancake balls swimming in syrup.

I just wish they had Pav Bhaji. Right now there is only one place in town that REALLY makes and markets their Pav Bhaji and that's Urban Turban.

Aside from that, Angara's staff are the friendliest I've ever encountered. This one dude is smiling all the time so much to the point I actually thought he was on anti-depressants. I mean this guy looks so happy I wish I could think like him 24/7 LOL."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. A simple lunch buffet, but everything served is top notch. The samosas are flakey and buttery on the outside and the filling is smooth, creamy and delicious. All in all a top notch hidden gem in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant, very clean delicious food! I Recommend to anyone that enjoy healthy and exotic food"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! I have loved getting naan and tika Marsala here. They'll never up spice you, meaning they won't say it's no spice then show up and it's spicy. Luckily they are very good at spice range! Great flavors awesome buffet for lunch. Cool place to try some Indian food."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good.  Their Tika is fantastic.  I have no idea why people go next door to Tropical Smoothy with this place right next door!

The service is fantastic and everyone is so curious.  Be sure to try a little of everything and don't forget the Mango Lassi.

Angara is by far the best Indian food in town."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the price for lunch buffet is super good! The waiters are very friendly, they offer a choice of garlic or original naan. The samosa is very big, It goes well with the sauce. The interior is grand, it is fun watching indian music videos while eating."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  Las Vegas has lots of offerings for Indian food but this does not rise to the rest of the pack.  Came here for lunch and had the Buffett.  A buffet should be a good representation of the food that the restaurant offers and if that is the case than I will not be back.  I had the Saag, chicken tika masala, and the goat curry.  Along with the garlic naan.  Both the chicken and goat were bland and the saag was so spicy that it killed my tastebuds for the rest of the meal. The naan was gummy and under done.  So if you are in the mood for Indian.. try lazee or Mint."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food close to where I live. 

We got the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and the lamb Rohan josh.

The chicken tikka masala was good but not great the but the lamb Rogas josh was excellent! 5/5

One thing I really liked about this place was that he was able to give me a good gauge on spicy level. The green side sauce that they provide is a spicy level 6. Taste that and then you can go from there. We got a spicy level 7 and it was perfect. Spicy but not so spicy we couldn't take it.

The service here was also really good and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"I have been waiting so long for an Indian restaurant on this side of town, and let me tell you, it is delicious. They have a fantastic lunch buffet that has tons of variety, and only $10 per person. They even let you take it to go, which is great if you need a quick lunch on the run. Their lunch buffet has all the usual favorites and some of the selections change based on the day, which is nice. The most important part, the food is fantastic, with several vegan and vegetarian options which was great since we had a vegan person eating with us. The owners are very helpful and pointed out which items she would be able to eat, and even got her special bread, as the naan is not vegan. I did enjoy the garlic naan a lot, of course, and is made fresh to order even if you are getting the lunch buffet. If you are a fan of indian food, especially the spicy dishes, give this place a shot, I can see us becoming regulars here!"}
{"text":"Best and freshest Indian lunch buffet. Great assortment,  delicious food and excellent service!  Terrific value at only $11."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal. Food is delicately and perfectly spiced, fresh and delicious. We have eaten a lot of Indian food and this restaurant rates one of the best."}
{"text":"This five star review is well deserved. I was late to the Indian food game. This was the first Indian restaurant I ever tried. A group of friends wanted to go after an event and I had always wanted to try. Our server was so helpful that I wish I remembered his name! We ordered a tandoori mixed grill, butter chicken, the yogurt sauce, tons of naan (garlic and their spicy green pepper naan), tikka Marsala and a few other things. My favorite dishes were the butter chicken and the chicken tikka! I ventured out and tried plenty of other Indian places but this one is still my favorite! Recently I cut out meat products. The restaurant was more than happy to accommodate. They have a lot of veggie options but I asked if they could change the butter chicken instead. I expected just a few veggies if anything but they put in cauliflower, zucchini, and tofu that was flavored so well it tastes better than the original! I also got their vegetarian potato dumplings (can't remember the name) but they were dusted with this curry powder and when dipped in the green chutney they provide... so good! Check this place out.. portions are huge and the food is full of flavor! I look forward to many more Indian nights with this place"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Try the samosas, they have them dialed in to perfection. Love the Ghana Masala bit every dish is great. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We had the lunch buffet on Sunday and well worth the $11.99. Loved the Curry chicken and the tikka masala chicken , the garlic naan is so soft and flavorful. Love this place, great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Why are there so many 5 star reviews?  We ordered this thru Bite Squad - maybe the delivery orders they do not put the care as the dining room?  The naan and the roti breads were OLD - not fresh at all - chewy - not edible at all!  The lamb did not seem like lamb - it was tough - VERY over salted and way spicy a level 3 (of 5).  The butter chicken was very tough.  The green sauce (not sure what it is called) was dried up and the red was just oil.  Only thing I can say was edible was the rice - and even that lacked any flavor.  

I understand things happen, but Bite Squad has offered me a small delivery credit to order again from them - not acknowledging the issues here.  They said they tried contacting the restaurant multiple times and have not heard a response."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place from the moment we walked in even though we were the only ones In there at the time. The popadoms with the 2 sauces was really good. We had the chicken Korma and aloo gobi (vegetable something) and they were both busting with flavor amazing. We were served by the owner and he was very friendly and helpful. We loved this place and glad we have a great Indian on the west side. Can't wait to try the lunch buffet next. Don't get anything past a 6 on the heat level , we had a 7 and I was sweating bullets. Rice pudding was an awesome dessert."}
{"text":"Formerly a Custom Built Pizza, this location has been completely remodeled and transformed into a nice Indian restaurant with lunch buffet ($11) and a la carte dinner. Appears to be family owned and operated, service is polite and prompt.

Upon entry and seating, you are immediately asked for your naan preference (plain vs garlic, go for the garlic!) and released to the buffet- incredible samosas, two types of rice, 5 vegetarian dishes, 5 meat dishes,  soup, and a simple fruit/salad/condiment bar. Standouts for me were the garlic naan, the incredible samosas, and a robust but not spicy goat curry. I found the tandoori chicken a bit try, the available soup too peppery, and was disappointed not to find saag paneer. Even so, I'd keep this spot in mind if I'm on this side of town and in need of a carb load... or just more incredible samosas!"}
{"text":"We thought the food was ok until we got home and got diarrhea! Never going there again! 

We went for lunch buffet and now that all of us got diarrhea, I can't help but think about how long the food was left out. I noticed that the waiter had the chaffing dishes turned off(no heat). He turned them on right as we were about to leave and that's when I noticed it was off the whole time! 

Food needs to be hot in order for bacteria not to thrive! Simple concept. I hope management reads this and resolves their errors.  

Their mango lassi was ok. Very watery and tasted artificial. Their goat curry was so rubbery and chewy. Their chicken korma was really salty. Palak paneer and chickpea were good."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with our almost 2 year old daughter for the lunch buffet around 1pm on a Saturday. We walked in and we were the only diners, which i thought was odd. We were immediately greeted by a host and sat down at a comfy booth. The host took our naan order (garlic) and we got waters and one manjo lassi drink to share.  The magno lassi was delicious. The selection of food is nice and the plates aren't too big so it really helps to limit the amount of food each diner can take so people don't waste food. I tried the samosas, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and vegetable pakora. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Even my daughter tried almost everything on our plates. The taste was great. It could've been hotter, but the food was not cold. The samosas are so amazing and the naan was also great as it was not too doughy or thick. It was flakey and light with a nice amount of garlic. Overall we were very happy and will be coming back soon. Our alternative would be Delhi indian buffet, but it's way further from us and this place has all of my favorite items. They serve fish pakora too, but i didn't try it. Best of all they serve hot gulab jamon in syrup, which is my favorite dessert. Check this place out! They are doing it right! I hope they get busier and stay for awhile. I'm happy to say that several more people came in after us that also seemed to be first timers."}
{"text":"They make one of the best chana masalas that I've ever had. Im so happy to finally have delicious Indian food in my area!!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. The service was great! I will definitely be coming here again. They have many vegan options."}
{"text":"I have ordered a few times for home delivery and the food is always great.
This time I had family from out of town so we decided to actually to go the restaurant to eat.
It was already 9:00 pm.
The restaurant was empty , well after all it was kinda late.
We were greeted by a pleasant server who showed us to a nice comfortable booth.

I love the decor of the restaurant and that they had an Indian movie playing on the TV screens. 
Very nice touch.
The place is lit dim, but I like that.
Very clean and tidy too.

Everything we ordered was amazing. 
Fresh and cooked to perfection.
My favorite dishes here are Chicken Tikka and Channa Masala , basmati rice and garlic Naan. 
My mouth is now watering just thinking of their food. Yes it is that delicious, and I know Indian food.
The service was exceptional and very friendly staff.

This has become my number one favorite Indian place to eat at in Vegas."}
{"text":"The adventure begins. This is the first time My wife had Indian food. She was skeptical. We sat at a booth, comfortable and roomy. The restaurant was nicely decorated without being overdone. My daughter has a uniquely gifted palette and seeks out the most interesting beverages.  She was very pleased with the mango lassi. So much so we all ordered one and loved it. We then ordered three entrees. Everything from lamb with spinach, chicken curry to a sample meat dish. Having never experienced Indian food my wife and daughter were pleasantly surprised. The food was wonderful, it literally made all three of us happy. I have cooked for many years and can honesty say food that is well prepared and from the heart has a magical quality. This food we had tonight, had that magic. I also have to mention Amed, I hope I spelled his name right, he was warm and welcoming, very informative. We will definitely be back and will spread the word! All I can say now is dhanyavaad, thank you, and we'll done."}
{"text":"Clean & nice setting & really great food. Truly the best Indian food I have had in Vegas. Can't wait to come back and try the lunch buffet! The garlic naan was amazing as was the mulligawty soup. We had the non vegetarian \"appetizer\" which was lots of little things to try and even my picky hubby loved it. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their lunch buffet is fresh, flavorful and also have lots vegetarian dishes.  Some dishes are bit salty but if if you eat it with Naan or rice then it's perfect.   The service is friendly, the place look cleaned.  Loving everything here"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food as good as I can get in new York. I haven't ordered off the menu yet but I've had the buffet a bunch of times and it's delicious. They have a very nice variety some dishes are spicy and I like it."}
{"text":"A bit of a drive for us but so worth it! Goat curry, lamb rogan josh, chicken tikka masala, naan, basmati rice, and the combo appetizer plate.  Beat we've had in town.   Service was impeccable.  So much on the menu we still want to try. Hubby will be spending a lot of lunches there for the buffet I am afraid."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, it was great! Great service and food, they have a lunch buffet, the table next to me was raving about the food also, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I and my wife always order Chicken Tikka Masala but this time we ordered Mango Curry Chicken.  It was wonderful.  It had just enough heat and spice and was sweet too.  I was very happy with the dish.  We also had Vegetable Manchurian.  This is a dish that not all Indian food restaurants make.  I really enjoyed this dish.  It was a great dinner and we will be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful buffet, clean, staff is very nice, food is amazing! $12 lunch buffet per person, so much traditional Indian food. Consistent every time we go. I love this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food around! Crispy samosas with perfect sauce! Amazing Chana masala with friendly and prompt service. Can't wait to try the buffet..."}
{"text":"They always treat us like family. Their garlic naan, meat samosas with fresh lime/lemon, butter chicken... its all amazing!"}
{"text":"The buffet was amazing. Meat dishes as well as the requisite vegetarian fare. Service was kind. An all around nice experience for a quiet afternoon. Make sure to get there early, traffic starts around 1pm."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery once before everything was fine, but this second time. Tried the tandoori combo, the shrimp tasted like soap. I think I'd skip that when ordering. Seriously had to brush my teeth to get rid of that taste. Everything else I had was good."}
{"text":"Great foods and awesome services. It's my favorite place for Indian food curries. The place is clean and decent"}
{"text":"Oh my god I love this place. I probably have my husband pick this up at least twice a month to get my Indian fix.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Marsala and the Lamb Vanderloo.  We always get the basmati rice, garlic naan, as well as the potato samosas.  Yum!!!  I would like to try some of the other items on the menu

Amazing!  My favorite Indian place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffett is 100% worth it, for only 10.99 you can get your fill of naan, and plenty of different curries. However, we went late one night to get their food and everything is wayyyy overpriced. Upwards to 20 dollars a plate for the food, so honestly we walked out the other night, we can find better quality food for 20 a plate."}
{"text":"Update:
I have eaten here several times in the last few months and I cannot say enough great things about the staff. They truly make the dining experience exceptional. 

For this vegetarian, I appreciate the many options available and that they change the dishes frequently. I have my favorites for sure but enjoy trying the new selections. I love the cabbage with mustard seasoning. Never knew this was an indian dish, but I love it. The samosas are perfect every time and I have enjoyed the eggplant dish, potatoes and cauliflower, and the chick peas!

My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the inconsistency in the quality of food. The saag is consistently way too salty and way too hot. I put it on my plate each visit and each visit I taste it and am so disappointed. I can't remember the name of the vegetarian dish with the vegetables in yellow sauce, but this dish needs to be made with fresh vegetables and not the frozen cut vegetables mostly used. Often, I can taste the old freezer burn and it too is disappointing. It tastes like frozen vegetables were simply dumped in a sauce. I know your cook can do better. I ate a potato dish once visit in which it was over seasoned with cloves to the point where I found at least 5 hard cloves in one small scoop serving. 

Yesterday's visit was one of my least favorable experiences where the food was not very good at all. I was not there early or late, and the food was fresh on the line, but out of 6 vegetarian dishes, only 2 were edible. The other 5 were over salted compared to usual and the spinach dish continues to be a hot level of 7 on a scale from 1-5. 

i will continue to visit because I'm sure this restaurant has the potential to be a 5 star experience. Make a couple minor adjustments like using real vegetables instead of frozen, add new dishes with chick peas or peas, paneer, eggplant etc. reduce the salt (since the wonderful spices are enough to carry the dish). 

Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani is not supposed to be chicken in rice. Do you even know how to make a Biryani? Do you know what a Biryani is? A 10 year old kid in India could make better food than this and they do. Please go take some cooking lessons."}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian food in the city. We hit the weekday lunch buffet every couple of weeks, I can't tell you how many times I've said how badly I am craving this place on a Saturday'. It's definitely a treat to feast at the buffet...quite a few chicken dishes (the chicken tikka is the best I've ever had anywhere) a few vegetarian options and even a goat dish (my other half's favorite). 

Don't forget to save room for dessert too! The kheer (a rice pudding with cardamom and ground nuts is amazing and the Mr. (who usually skips dessert) always gets a bowl of the gulab jamun (a ball of milk solids fried and soaked in honey). 

The owners and the servers are ALWAYS happy, courteous and quick to remove plates and refill your glasses. We always leave with a huge smile on our face and a full belly...and usually have the \"I can't wait till we can go back\" conversation on the drive home. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Great service! Tasteful food will come back. Monti was our server and took very care of us. Best Indian food in summerlin"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant, food was fresh, had good flavor and was a unique place for dinner. Being an American, I knew nothing on the menu, but the waiter happily suggested what was good to try for new comers. If you're looking for a unique place for lunch or dinner, come try it out."}
{"text":"Craving satisfied!   We were in the area recently and noticed this new Indian place. Upon this sight my husband recalled his fondness for Lamb Vindaloo and we promised to go and try it. 

The food was excellent. We got the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Biryani, various types of Naan. The lamb was tender and incredibly flavorful.  We enjoyed a Mango Lassi and even had some dessert.  The whole meal was a treat for the palate.

Our positive experience was made possible by the warm and friendly service we received.  Our server was welcoming and attentive; answering questions and offering suggestions. We plan to return and look forward to trying some new dishes!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian food spot in Las Vegas! They have an amazing buffet in the morning-afternoon. You can even do all you can eat to-go. Just put as much as you can fit in the box! Their food is always on point and I have never been disappointed. Their staff is very friendly and the establishment is always clean. 5 star dining without a 5 star price."}
{"text":"Food here is very fresh. Made to order with the curry bases.  However, the spice/heat is very hot. Even when we asked for a mild spice, it was pretty hot.  The flavor though is excellent. So I didn't complain. The in house bread is delicious with the mint chutney. We also Uber the food from here on a weekly basis.  We have actually eaten here because it helped with my joint inflammation and the current rounds of the flu symptoms I've been having.  You might want to uber the food though, my husband noticed the portions are bigger when we order take out."}
{"text":"The Resturant was dead for a Friday night.  The food was good and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Easily one of top Indian in Las Vegas. My girlfriend is not too big of fan of Indian but she was ok with place. I eat lots of indian and this place is better than most.  I have been here 3-4 times now and like this a lot."}
{"text":"This is my second Indian restaurant I've eaten since moving here to Vegas. I was very pleased with my chicken tiki masala dish I ordered. My son ordered the mango curry which he truly enjoyed as well. The service was very good. One thing I would say is that I prefer the ambiance from the first Indian restaurant I went to versus this one. Angara seems more of a casual setting which is probably why I observed more order pick ups than a sit down. I'll definitely come back to try their all you can eat buffet though which some reviewers were raving about."}
{"text":"I am very picky with my Indian food. It is my favorite cuisine and I hate to see it butchered. This was the  BEST  Indian food I have ever had in my life. I will return 1000 times. Great VEGAN options. Service was amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Ordered delivery through Grubhub and arrived HOT.

Chicken tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo."}
{"text":"I've tried many Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and this one impresses me the most. The flavor of the food is very distinctive.  You can tell that the food is prepared very well."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious! 
I come here very regularly for lunch! The buffet is amazing a pretty good selection and the food is amazing. Service is 5 star the people that work there are attentive and bend over backwards for you. Super clean, and super tasty, they play Indian Music videos on the screens which makes this experience even better. I love everything about this place. (Even better is that it's right down the street from my office!)"}
{"text":"First time trying this. The food is really good. I did the lunch buffet. The price is not bad. The food is not too spicy either. It's just right."}
{"text":"Prices are high and curry portions are small. 
Which would be okay if the food is excellent but it's just A-OK.
The tandoori chicken was pretty bland. I am not a huge chicken eater but I know good tandoori flavor and it was lacking at Angara.
The chicken tikka masala was pretty good flavor wise, but $16 for a small copper bowl.
The Aloo Gobi was chunkier than I'm used to but decent. I still prefer it to be saucier. 
10% off with Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"This is an unbelievably good establishment. The people are so genuinely kind and I loved their recommendations. I ate the chicken tikka masala per a friend's request and was surprised by how well put together it was. To keep this shorter, I highly recommend coming here. It's a wonderful place."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim looking for Indian food options near my home in Summerlin. I definitely enjoyed my experience and would definitely return in the future:

- Walking in you are greeted with a blast of strong aromas of spices. You will leave with this smell baked into all of your clothing, be warned.
- Began with a plate of complimentary lentil wafers and chutney + cilantro. Delicious!
- Ordered a single order of meat samosas. The order came with two of them, both of which were the size of a fist and delicious.
- The garlic naan is great, the normal naan is alright, and the chicken tikka masala is fantastic. The lamb curry is also well done. Both the tikka masala and curry were overflowing from their respective platters. And three orders of naan were more than enough for three people.
- Service was prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"I adore this place. It is my favorite Indian restaurant in town. 

Decor/Atmosphere: 5/5
I love the feel of the place. Most of the time when we have gone you can watch the music videos, which are awesome!

Cleanliness: 5/5
I've never had an issue in my 5 times that I have been there. There is an attention to detail. They clearly take pride in their restaurant. 

Food: 5/5
As a spicy eater, this is one of the few places in town that I can get a hot enough meal. Typically, it takes really emphasizing that it needs to be really hot. 15 out of 10 level of hot, but they'll do it. Also, it still has a flavor. It's not \"can I make this food burn\"; it's \"how can I balance such pungent heat with the essence of the dish\". That takes skill and usually a spicy fan to do it. Whoever is back there gets it. They are the real MVP. 

Service: 5/5
The service is always outstanding.  I've watched them go the extra mile to accommodate many tables."}
{"text":"The delivery was timely, but the tandoori chicken was rather tasteless (got medium spice). Go with one of the spicier options to avoid the blandness."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner recently and had a very pleasant time. The staff was very cordial and polite. The place at the time we went (around 6:30 PM on a Friday night) was quiet but I believe more people come here for their lunch buffet. The food was delicious and was happy to rely on Yelp to find this little spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, amazing flavors and very friendly staff. If you like Indian food, it's great. If you're not sure, try it. Tandoori is flavorful, perfectly cooked. The lamb dishes are excellent. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Buffet is super cheap. About $12 per person and you'll be full after your first plate. Great waiter as well. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Good food. Good food. Everything I ate tasted so good and so well-made. Of course this is subjective, but I think it's better than a lot of other Indian buffets (which are not bad either) staff was very nice. Good atmosphere in the restaurant. And I really do recommend this place. For lunch at least"}
{"text":"What a great place. These people who run this place are extremely pleasant and attentive and the dinner was fabulous.

We couldn't figure out what we wanted as everything sounded so good, so we ordered a couple bowls of Mulligawnee soup and their non-vegetarian dinner for two and Garlic Naan. Everything was cooked to perfection and their timing of serving as we went through each course was completely on-point. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was good, and price is unbeatable for the lunch buffet. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food for dinner service was excellent. It's perfect for a date or to bring the whole family. The service was top notch all the way around. The food was amazing we were a party of three and ordered three different items so we could get a feel for the place. Everything was perfect. I recommend the Chicken Tikka Marsala at a level 5 spice. I love when a place gives you the option of how spicy you like your food from a scale of 1-10 because they make it fresh from scratch. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet. The bill was fair considering an upscale restaurant, top service and quality food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious cuisine. Great authentic flavors. Just moved from SD where Indian cuisine is easily available; searching Yelp for Las Vegas locations, which are a few and far between, especially in the Summerlin area. 

I was pleasantly pleased the first visit and happily surprised in the quality and consistency on the 2nd and 3rd dining experiences.

Congrats, they deserve the 5 stars I'm giving them"}
{"text":"Really bad. Don't go here. I don't understand how they have 4.4 stars. Worst tikka masala sauce I've ever had, and the vegetables are from the freezer. Really loud kitchen, as well, and the booths are quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Favorite Indian restaurant in town. Best lentil soup and chili paneer. Very good service."}
{"text":"Hot fresh and delicious. We ordered meat samosas and meat naan (lamb) and it was so hot and fresh.  The flavor was incredible.  The tamarind sauce was great.  The service was accommodating and friendly and they even made us a special order at lunch time and accommodated all my fathers special requests.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really wish I didnt give up white rice and flour, because everything I ate at Angara's lunch was so flavorful and delicious. Oh garlic Naan how I've missed you.

The ambiance is very nice and the gentleman working the dining room was extremely pleasant.

I can't remember the names of the dishes I had besides the tandoori and curry chickens, but they were all prepared well with unique flavors and spices. The cold bar items were fresh. I especially enjoyed the yogurt and mint chutney. 

I would recommend Angara to any fan of Indian cuisine or diners with ambitious tastebuds."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch and it was delicious. I enjoyed the lunch buffet - - it had many options to choose from. Very friendly staff and a nice environment, too. I prefer my Indian food to be more spicy but I understand that they needed to keep it more neutral for the buffet. I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Okay. Here is the deal with this place. My wife and two kids (8) and (16) went for dinner. Ordered veggie somosa, vegetable soup, combo of different curries, chicken tikki mas. and garlic naan.

Food is good, takes forever to get it (make things fresh), Ordered 1 soup to try and brought 4. Charged us for all 4.  Service is good, but there is a bit of a communication barrier, (ordered one thing and got something else). For 4 of us the bill was $92, food was good, but for 2 hours eating (mostly waiting) and not getting what we wanted......meh......

Lesson here. Just go to the lunch buffet. It's $10 and includes basically everything we ordered and you don't have to wait and you get what you want. If you are wanting dinner, try somewhere else. For the buffet its a steal."}
{"text":"There is a lot of great things to say about this place. The owner/staff are super nice and on top of there game. I have tried the chicken biryani , butter chicken , chicken vindaloo , and the tandoori chicken.. They all were amazing to be honest. Flavorful , spicy ( to your liking ) and delicious. The rice was cooked perfect! The garlic Naan goes great with everything. Defiantly give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had an amazing treat today as I got to taste a variety of dishes from Angara's buffet. I love that they offer it along with a full  menu to give people options.  Everything I ate was packed with flavors that hit every palate leaving me wanting to lick my plate lol. My 1 year old infant, a picky eater, loved everything on my plate to! I also loved the ambiance as well. It's a family owned restaurant and I definitely tasted the love! I'm coming back this Friday and Saturday to treat my mom in law and sister in law to this Indian delight!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for dinner thinking it served the buffet style too but it didn't.  So we ordered a la carte from the menu and we liked it a lot.   We chose the right degree of spice although I could have gone higher.  We'll have to try the lunch buffet one of these days."}
{"text":"Really good authentic food. Liked the biryani lamb. My wife loved their lentil soup. Bread is tasty
Will come back again"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Southern California and found this restaurant by luck. The food is indescribably good. My husband is of Indian heritage and we have had Indian food in nearly every city we have been to and this one ranks at the very top. We had the brunch. The curries were flavorful and some slightly spicy. The rice and bread also very good. The gulab jamin (desert dumplings) were the best I have ever tasted. Needless to say, this will be one of the first places we go to on our next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really amazing Indian food. Great buffet. Approx $12 per person. Best Indian food I have had so far. Great spices and freshness. Great atmosphere and very clean.
Very nice and friendly staff. Ample open parking. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Best Indian restaurant around.  Wife and I enjoyed Lamb Mutter and Malai Kofta, respectively.  We both went on and on how good it was that we tried each others dish.  I was floored by how good it was and I'm not a fan of lamb.  We had veggie  samosa and an interesting desert, Gulab Jamun.   Incredible.  BEST EVER"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was great aswell. Good buffet and open late for late night indulgences!"}
{"text":"Despite high price, rice not included with the entrees...very frustrating on a delivery...it wasn't clearly marked on menu.  Portions were ok and sauces were average but Lamb was tough, chicken tika had an inedible consistency...soft almost fish like on the thinner pieces and rubbery/crunchy on the thicker ones.  Mint chicken was ok.  Vegetable Korma was good.  There are better options at the price point."}
{"text":"What an amazing surprise this little place is! The food was so good!!

A friend suggesting trying somewhere new, so we agreed on Angara.
The minute I walked in I was met with a smile, and escorted to a cozy little booth.
My friend showed up a few minutes later.

We poured over the menu, and finally decided on...
Mango Curry - ($12.99) Slightly sweet and spicy. This dish had fabulous flavor but overwhelmed with too much \"heat\". It was perfect.

Chicken Tiki Marsala - ($14.99) This one had a little more heat, but not too spicy at all. It was rich, creamy and flavorful! A great rendition of one of my favorite Indian dishes

Aloo Gobi - ($11.99) Cauliflower and potatoes. This was a nice dish as well. 

Garlic Nan - ($2.99) YUM. You can't go wrong with a great nan!

And a side of Riata - ($3.99) A creamy yogurt and cucumber sauce.

We loved EVERYTHING!!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian place is Las Vegas! So yummy and enjoyable! The garlic naan is to die for! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery, everything was great! Had the chicken vindaloo, with rice and garlic nann. Medium spice popped, but wasn't overwhelming to the point of being overly spicy. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great Buffett options.  Big samosas and wait staff very happy.  Was a little dead so hopefully they last.  The goat curry could if been more tender but tasty."}
{"text":"Qty is good...But Flavors are average ..If your familiar with  dal makgani...paneeer butter masala type if recipes..Then you wouldn't be very much impressed with the Flavors...1 ..Max 2 times try...I would recommend it for at least 1 time eat"}
{"text":"I'm updating for their lunch buffet, which is amazing! First off, the variety of food, including the samosa, goat curry, and their infamous tamarind and mint chutneys are delicious. I loved everything at the buffet especially the goat curry and Saag. For $12 per person, you cannot go wrong! Oh, and get this -- galib jamun is INCLUDED AND endless up at the buffet! 

Their food is outstanding and it is, and to provide a buffet of the greatest hits is the best thing ever."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants in summerlin. The ambiance is a bit dated and tired, but the food is on point. The vegetarian entrees are very good, especially the daal makhani. Also the butter chicken, korma and handi chicken were very good. The garlic nana was also delicious as well as the complimentary chutney. Next time will try the tandoori."}
{"text":"Love this place! A week ago, we ordered chicken vindaloo, chicken korma & lamb briyani for dinner at home. It was exceptional! We went for the lunch buffet yesterday. Buffet price was reasonable & food that they served was scrumptious. Great Customer service by Moorthi! Chef Jaipal was awesome and the Boss Dev came out to say hi too. We will be back soon. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Our entire family enjoyed a delicious lunch today. The food selection was broad and the flavors were right on point. The restaurant was spotless and had two flat screens to display Bollywood movies. The garlic naan was sublime. Our boys raved about the desserts. Very reasonable at $10.99 per person for the lunch buffet. Everyone's favorite was the chicken korma, but it was all very flavorful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I eat from here whether it is take out, dine in/ buffet or delivery. The food from here is consistently delicious. The staff is always so friendly. I recommend this restaurant whole heartedly."}
{"text":"Being from England I'm always worried about ordering Indian food. I grew up eating amazing Indian, and haven't found anything close since I left back in '81. Lamb vindaloo is my favorite and usually a good indication of how the food's going to be. Well, it was amazing, as good as anything I ever ate growing up!  Perfect spices, right amount of potatoes and lamb that melts in your mouth. So happy to have finally find excellent Indian cuisine. Compliments to the chef! Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Rohan gave us great service! The Lamb Byrani was seasoned well...even the Meat Samosas were on point...my pallet is very happy! Thanks for the wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had their lunch buffet twice and really enjoyed it.  The variety of foods was good, and the descriptions were clear and understandable.  The garlic naan is delicious and you can get refills on it.  The gentleman who served us was very attentive, courteous, and answered any questions we had.  

We will be going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I tried both lunch and dinner here. Their buffet style lunch is limited, but for me it is enough selections of curry sauce and salad for lunch. When I had a dinner there the other day, I got confused when I was looking their menu. However the server nicely described their menu, and he recommend one of the appetizers and beef curry. It was really tasty, well balanced, and good customer service."}
{"text":"First time here.  Visited for buffet lunch.  Great selection for the $11.99 price.  Friendly attentive service.  Garlic naan served hot from the kitchen.  I loved everything I had, was on the spicier spectrum which I love.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time and their lunch buffet had all of my favorite dishes! Very nice staff and delicious food for very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I believe this is my very first yelp
I just had to comment
I was supposed to go out for Italian and then I thought this gem Tucked Away by the LVAC gym
If you have ever wanted fresh Indian cuisine this is the place to come
I went for the buffet with a friend and I savored every bite
The address is 4165 S. Grand Canyon Dr. Suite 105
The phone number 702-876-0050
Today with the luckiest day i've had in the definition of great food in a fast and fine manner
Come here and thank me later

{"text":"So good! Came here for lunch and enjoyed the buffet! We have been going to another Indian restaurant in Henderson for years and find it hard to find comparable curry. Found out the same chef is here and are so excited! Highly recommend! Service and food is on point!"}
{"text":"Had the Paneer masala and garlic naan, both were excellent. I think the buffet would be the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ordered to go through the yelp app and order was ready by the time I walked in.

Rice is separate so don't forget to include that in your order! One side of it is enough for 2 people.

AYCE lunch for around $11/12 

Food tasted great. We had 

Paneer Makhani 
Chicken Vindaloo
Garlic Naan
1 side of rice

Plennnnnnty of food which became lunch the next day. Careful with the spice levels! I got an 8 and my mouth was on fire!

Overall great experience, easy ordering, very friendly staff at pickup (who invited us to come back and dine in), and all of our food tasted amazing! Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that there are some new, tasty Indian spots here in the Southwest side of town!  (This spot and also check out Curry Leaf!)

Came here on a Monday evening and the place was empty which worried me, but I trust Yelp reviews so I stayed lol.  The server was obviously new because she didn't know much about the menu but I appreciated she was willing to help and probably ran back to the kitchen 3-4 times to ask questions for me (I can be a pain lol). She got some training out of the way though! Lol

We ordered the meal for two option that included 4-5 entree tastings, rice, naan, yogurt sauce and some desert. I haven't seen this at an Indian place before and I would suggest this option to try the menu!  The butter chicken and the ginger chicken were very good! 

They offer a buffet daily which I am planning on coming back to check out :)"}
{"text":"New favorite!  

It's only been open for several weeks.  The Indian Buffet was outstanding. The value of $10.99 with as much rice and naan as you want was a huge surprise.

The service was friendly and prompt.  The food....  I had everything and everything was phenomenal.  

Can't wait to go again next week!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. I've had much better Indian food. I was SHOCKED that their entrees don't come with rice, especially since they are higher than average prices(~15). I ordered butter chicken and garlic naan through uber eats and it was $24.45. A little steep for the quality and absence of rice... won't return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian places in the Summerlin area. $11 buffet is great, especially since they have everything I would order anyway (vindaloo, korma, tikka masala). Naan and rice is included so it's totally worth the price. 

Heads up, the curries for the buffet do rotate every day so it's not always the same, and if you have anything left over (even a few pieces of naan) you're not allowed to take it with you. That's only for the buffet though, if you're there for dinner, they give you foil and to-go boxes. 

It hasn't been super packed the last few times I've been here, but service has been efficient. The waiter (it's always been the same guy) is great about refilling water and bringing naan when you're running low. 

Overall, the place is clean and cozy, with awesome food. Definitely recommend Angara if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food, spicy, tasteful and fresh ingredients.  Professionally packed for a take away, I was truly amazed at the quantities and flavor.  The lamb biryani was absolutely phenomenal and I have eaten this dish at quite a few Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't had Indian food since moving to Vegas a 1 1/2 years ago, so I've been craving it for somtime. I had been searching for an Indian buffet nearby  thank you to whomever added Angara as a business for ending my search.

Angara is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds, next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. 

Buffets is available only during lunch and is only $10.99/person. If you have never had Indian food, this is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact, I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish, they are more than happy to answer your questions.

As you are seated, you are offered two types of naan, plain or garlic. I chose plain as I had to return to the office, and I wanted to be sure I could taste the flavors of the other dishes.

At the beginning of the buffet, they have large sized samosas (my all time favorite, Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas),  followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer (my all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish, creamy spinach with cheese cubes),  lentil and eggplant dishes. I'm not a hot/spicy dish person. In the past, I have known saan paneer as a mild dish, but Angara makes it spicy that I had to eat it with the naan instead of the rice. 

Unfortunately, because I filled up on the samosa, vegetarian dishes, rice and naan, the only meat dish I could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time, I'll have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry. One dish I wish they had is fried fish bites.

At the end of the buffet were desserts that I'm unfamiliar with, but will try in a future visit, and  regular house salad which baffles me with all the vegetarian dishes available, but to each his/her own."}
{"text":"I would give it 2.5. Is it just me or was everything just meh. I feel like something was lacking in taste and I couldn't figure out what it was. I will say, the garlic naan was delicious and the samosa was good. Everything else was just... Meh. The chicken was really dry, wasn't impressed at all. The mango lassi was an utter fail. It tasted like milk smoothie. Let me clarify, it was delicious as a smoothie, but if you were wanting the mango lassi, it just wasn't there. The food wasn't as warm as I would have liked it, but the real question is, would I come back? I would use this place as an emergency Indian buffet. If I woke up at 2:15p and I had no time to drive for my usual Indian buffet, I would come here to get my fix to hold me over (scratches neck)"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch buffet!  Lots of veggies, meats, and sweets! Wonderful service. Nice ambience with plenty of light. I'll be here once a week!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, though the prices a bit high, but the waiters are very friendly, this was my second time there and I enjoyed every moment of it."}
{"text":"I love the ability to get vegan Indian food here and it is delicious. Unfortunately, they use styrofoam and plastic tubs for the to go orders. Not only is it terrible for the environment, but the chemicals in both styrofoam and plastic then leach into the food inside the containers.  I will not be a customer anymore of restaurants that 1) do not care about the health of its customers and 2) do not care about the environment. There are plenty of paper products for take out that they could and should use. Until you care about all, I will not be able to give you my business. I will wait until the masses wake up to this and you will not have any choice but to change how you pack your to go orders."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot if I'm craving Indian food. I've been coming to this restaurant for almost 2 years now. Me and my boyfriend love it! Food is very tasty and the buffet is so worth it!!! The employees are super nice and very welcoming."}
{"text":"The saag paneer was possibly the best I've had, and since it's my favorite, I've tried my share!   For our entrees we ordered chicken curry and lamb vindaloo.  They were both amazing!   Portions are huge (yay- leftovers!).  The staff was fun, engaging, sweet, helpful and attentive.   My new favorite Indian restaurant.   Go there.  Often!"}
{"text":"one of the best Indian Food in Vegas! 
I was here with my family 6 months ago for dinner and had a nice experience.

I came here today to try the buffet. The buffet is a bargain at $10.99. I was happy to see they have goat curry. The garlic naam was crisp, and tender.  Some of the items they have on the buffet are Tandoori Chicken, chicken korma, bhindi masala, saag paneer, chicken tikka masala. The dessert  was Gulab gamun. They really meet the challenge of maintaining such an good selection of dishes at the buffet. 

Overall every dishes were savory with fresh ingredients. I absolutely love the decor. The place were elegant, clean and peaceful and the service was excellent. 

Definitely going to make this place a regular stop if not once a week, every two weeks."}
{"text":"I must have ordered on an off night. Must admit my bar is high when it comes to Indian food, having spent time there. My order was placed through a delivery service. They called to tell me the desert I ordered was unavailable. This was early in the evening. Also ordered were vegetable pakoras and vegetable samosas. I was craving curry and a little heat. I got none. This food was bland and flavorless. Very disappointing, probably will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm totally blown away... usually the selection of buffet items at other restaurants is menial at best, these guys deliver in selection, taste and service. Class A place to eat! Love it so much I left this review while still here!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and the food was very very okay. Definitely not worth the money. The Mahi Mahi was completely tasteless and it seemed that instead of marinating the fish for flavorful taste it seemed the spices were superficially coated making for a very expensive entree which is tasteless. We ordered two entrees them and could not finish more than half. The vegetarian food was a hair better than meat / chicken / seafood items. We landed up spending ~$300 for a big takeout order and this was the most expensive just about enough edible Indian food i have tasted. 

We found Curry Pot at the food court at the  Venetian, which is where you need to go to get a true taste of Indian food. Please avoid Angara with a 100 foot pole."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to try the lunch buffet. The cost is $11.99 and includes all the favorites including goat dishes, chicken tikka Masala, and a chutney bar. It was very tasty. They have fresh naan made to order with the buffet: plain or garlic. We would come again."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm good! I was going through Yelp reviews yesterday looking for a good Indian restaurant and today a Groupon for Angara popped up. Decided with the 4 out of 5 star rating and great Groupon deal that I had to check it out. 

First off I absolutely love the decor. Elegant, clean and peaceful. Secondly the l service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, kind and knowledgable. And the food? Delicious. Been missing good Indian food since I moved out to Vegas. 

I had never heard of Handi Chicken before but I'm glad we gave it a try. Fresh onions, bell peppers and chicken mixed with a delicious ginger garlic sauce. Just yummy. We also had to get the staple Chicken Tikka Masala and it was exactly how I like it. Not too sweet like I've had at some places. The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfectly creamy. Combined with the Garlic Naan and basmati rice I was simply in heaven. Oh and the hubby got a glass of the mango lassi that I ended up drinking half of because it was too good to stop. Lol sharing is caring. 

I absolutely loved the food and can't wait to try out their lunch buffet. I hear the selection of food at their buffet is not something to pass up."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get takeout frequently from here and I am never disappointed. The Mango Chicken is the best I have ever had. The service is always tops. The food is well packaged and doesn't leak or spill. The portions are large enough for two or two meals for you. The image is plated at my home, I don't like to eat out of containers"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch. The food is excellent and service was excellent. The had a small but well done lunch buffet. All the dishes were well done. Slightly spicy for my wife, perfect for me.

We both tried a little bit of everything and were pleased with all the dishes. The goat was not my favorite, even so, it was well done.

The place was clean, played nice relaxing music with some interesting artwork.

We look forward to coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet, it was just Ok. We actually get way better Indian food in Japan, sad to say. And that's not for this place, every Indian restaurant in Vegas is under par to what we have in Japan and England from what I hear. (Rhyming was not intended ;)"}
{"text":"We dine out often and love Indian cuisine.  This is a great find as we tried the Non Vegetarian dinner for 2.  It was so good. Enough food to take home for our son.  The Naan bread, butter chicken, rice pudding, etc. are fabulous.   I highly recommend.   The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch before heading over to Kohl's for some shopping because the girlfriend simply loves it more than anything else, well, perhaps not as much as coffee.  
The lunch price was $10.99 p/p and that part I like.  I wanted a King Fisher beer to go with my lunch, but alas, they don't have the bloody liquor license yet.  The jolly owner says they will soon.  
The food was good.  The presentation was nice and the place was clean and bright.  And thank god Bollywood was not playing on the TV"}
{"text":"I just had probably the best dahl I have ever had - and I have had a lot! I asked for 5/10 spicy which was PERFECT!!! Holy moly it was yummy! I liked it best with naan-dipped in it, rather than with the Biryani rice. I had a glass of Prosecco wine - pretty good. My brother had the shrimp Biryani- he said it was VERY GOOD (and he's picky). He ordered 7/10 spicy.  

We WILL be back! I couldn't finish the whole serving, so this will be my very delicious lunch for tomorrow.

Try it!! Really! Very reasonable prices for Summerlin, as well."}
{"text":"I got the chicken tikka masala via UberEATS and it came and I could feel how hot it was through the takeout container, which I loved. However, when I actually started eating I was waiting for the flavor to kick in and it never did. The flavor was rather underwhelming and I was quite disappointed. It had a nice spice level but the dimensions of flavor were really just not there. Maybe I got a bad batch but I would rather not order from here again. They also didn't include any utensils or napkins so that was inconvenient for me. The food wasn't horrible at all, but I'm not coming here again, sorry."}
{"text":"This was the best vegetable korma I've had. At every bite, when the creamy spicy sauce was touching my taste buds, it was sending a message to my brain to moan and say out loud \"Oh my god, this is soooo goooood!\". Same with the chickpeas and the Chicken Tikka Masala too."}
{"text":"Incredible food, so warm and flavorful.  The spices are awesome.  The variety in the menu is vast.  The service great.  Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here! Best food I've had in a long time!! Their pre-fixed menu for two is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Angara is the place to go if you are looking for fresh, fast, delicious food!  The restaurant is nestled in the southwest side of town by Target on Grand Canyon, and is definitely a gem. The restaurant is always clean, the service is great-our water glasses were always full, and naan was of abundance! Their lunch buffet won't disappoint either. They have a wide variety of he well-known, popular Indian dishes, desserts, and  chutneys to choose from. I look forward to visiting Angara whenever possible, and leave full and happy!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food we've had! Everything was fresh and full of flavor. Our waiter,Rohan, couldn't have been better. Even helped us pick out some new dishes we wouldn't normally have tried. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I grew up around Indian food in the Middle East, so we like to think we know a little about it. This is the place to be if you want authentic and great Indian food. Butter chicken is amazing, the bread is fresh and awesome (all of it) and we also had the sizzling chicken tikka, and veggie samosas and the lentil soup.  The service was also outstanding. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is great. Lunch buffet is amazing. A lot of vegan options. And it's right next door to Cinnaholic which has amazing cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Eat24 however they said the restaurant was responsible for the late delivery and incomplete order so I am including that in my review though the food itself was 3 stars. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic naan, basmati rice, and can of Coke. The order showed up cold 45 minutes late with no rice and Pepsi instead of Coke. The butter chicken had a lot of cartilage and some bones which was off putting though the sauce had a good taste. The chicken in the tikka masala was dry and the sauce was very thin and did not have as good of flavor. My order was $55. I wouldn't order food from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered take out with delivery last week. The service was friendly and prompt! The food was delicious so we decided to come and try their buffet today! We were not disappointed! The food was fresh and they had a variety of dishes. The ambiance is relaxing and the servers are friendly! The only suggestion I have is that they add some beef or lamb to their buffet since not everyone eats goat otherwise you are left with several chicken choices only! We will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Great service and average indian food. i am giving this place to 4 stars because of the good service. i don't know they will change the flavor of the food little bit in future or keep the same way and make people to go somewhere else. Biriani was little dry and Vindaloo need more meet beside lots of gravi. Naan bread is really good and Parata need more buttery flavor. hope they get better by the day."}
{"text":"I stopped here Sunday about 1 PM for their lunch buffet.  It's $`10.99 and it's a good price and well worth it.

I was told to sit anywhere I wanted--all the tables are for four people so I had a large table to myself.  Rani came and cleared the extra place settings and asked me for my preference of naan.  In addition, he asked me about drink other than water and I ordered and iced tea.

My first plate was a small plate with one large samosa, palak paneer, and some chana masala.  The palak paneer and chana masala had a nice zing to them but it wasn't too spicy that someone would not enjoy them.  The samosa was filled with potato and some peas.  It was very tasty and the crust was flaky.

For my second plate, I got some chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and basmati rice.  You'll notice no photo for this dish.  I enjoyed the first one so much that I just started eating and no photo.  The chicken was good.  I especially liked the chicken korma so when I went back for a third, smaller plate, I got more chicken korma along with goat curry and some sautéed cabbage because that seemed so different for an Indian restaurant.  All was good.  I made a final trip to have some gulab jamun to end on a sweet note.  

The restaurant is not very large but it's very pleasant.  The food is good.  I'm glad we have another option for Indian food on this side of town.  Service was very good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tonight we dined here, after a friend recommended this restaurant. 
We ordered the standard Lamb Kebab, Panner tikka and Chicken curry with a couple of rotis.
Food quantity  is small. compared to the price. So if you have a average eating appetite then these servings are small. You will need more, which means the bill goes up - items are really pricy - lamb kebab were $17.99 for 8 small pieces of lamb, Chicken curry was $14.99 less then 16 ounce of curry - oh also there is no rice included, this is a pricy menu 

The taste, was OK, nothing that would stand out. Maybe to new Indian cuisine diner it maybe a great, but for Indians this is an outright average north indian flavor. 
Service,was great, that is why I give it three stars, otherwise it would be lower. There was only one employee, on duty, and he was the server + busser + matre-de all in one. He was prompt, respectful and efficient. 

Overall I would rate this a pretty avg, clean local north Indian restaurant with similar menu items as all other north indian restaurants."}
{"text":"It was 3rd time I visited this Indian restaurant 
Lunch buffet was just okay . Great food but not many selections to choose 
And tonight I tried for dinner 
Food was good almost same like lunch 
My husband asked its come with rice or not . Server said yes so we order garlic naan and rice so we can share 
The end ...they changed 2 rice and 1 naan
2 rice for $8???? What??? 
I'm sorry I'm not gonna go back. I better go curry leaf."}
{"text":"I'm so excited! It's my first time at a Indian restaurant everyone is so nice !! Some Yummy food , I tried the chicken tikkamasala, they ask you how spicy you want it - garlic nan is superrr yummy and there rice is one of a kind everyone is so friendly beautiful restaurant nice for a date with and to go with friends:)"}
{"text":"After reading positive Yelp reviews I finally sought out this place and tried the lunch buffet.  It was worth the trip.  All the flavors are spot on.  The selection is better than most of the local lunch buffets.  The naan bread was so fresh it was too hot to touch.  I especially liked seeing  papadum on the buffet.  The palak paneer was great.  The tandoori chicken was tasty.  The chicken tikka masala, the kheer, the curry, the raita,...  The chutney selection was really nice.

Service was friendly and quick.  We never had to wait for anything.  The place is very clean and in a very nice newish neighborhood.  Freeway access is close.  Plenty of parking.  Next time I drive to Flamingo & 215 at lunchtime I am going there again for sure."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal. Veggie biryani, naan, chicken korma and lamb tandoori which was too much food for 3 people. So so good!"}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet in town for Indian food. Over cooked rice, sauces have no flavor, whoever rates this 4.5 stars obviously doesn't know good food , way over priced too. Mt. Everest Indian restaurant is the best! This place is -5 stars, apparently I have to pick a star to complete my review, HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"So damn good! 

I LOVE Indian food and have tried a few restaurants recently, but this place, small authentic, is absolutely excellent! 

We took the vegetarian dishes for two and everything was excellent. Like many other Indian restaurants though, beware that even if you'll ask for \"none spicy\" you'll get some measure or spiciness... other than that - absolutely great!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner today. Ordered aloo tikki, samosa, goat karahi,chana masla. Bhautra and naan. Everything on point, they truley deserve five stars. Service is very good too. I will back at Angara very soon"}
{"text":"It's far from my home but after reading reviews thought of trying it it was not that busy at lunch time food was good variety was good both vege and non veg good for me was not hot at all spice level was 5 mean below than medium I didn't try non veg because I was not sure their meat was halal or not as I only eat halal. Highlights of buffet was garlic nan, achar , chutness, mango pickle, papad, zeera rice , samosa and saag. Good choice for ppl who like low to medium spice level."}
{"text":"First had an obnoxious delivery driver at my door delivering the food. Then when I check my order it looked tossed around and was missing things from my order. When I called the restaurant they said I had already paid for it and any changes to the delivery would cost me the price of the missing items and delivery cost again. So to sum this up this place sucks (insert preferred profanity word here)."}
{"text":"I saw the rating on yelp and thought to try this place and just loved the simplicity of the food. Good food super friendly staff and very beautiful interior. I would recommend this place for every tourist in vegas who wants to eat Indian food."}
{"text":"The lamb that I ordered was so dry that I had to ask for some oil or something but, he suggested to use a sauce that was on the table. Didn't help at all. Left little disappointed. Won't go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have been there many times for the buffet. Love it. There are a lot of choices. The owner and workers are really nice people. Love their garlic naan, the chicken tikka masala, and probably one of the best rice pudding."}
{"text":"Oh boy! Awesome food. You have to try the mutton curry, it's simply awesome and the garlic naan melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious! One of the few Indian restaurants in the South Summerlin neighborhood. The daily lunch buffet is definitely worth the ~$12. Very filling and food is good. The tandoori chicken was great! As was their garlic naan! Their samosas are some of the best I've had-- huge and filled! My favorite is the dessert- the usual fried cheese dough with honey syrup-- tasted better than I've ever had before. For an entree order, the portions are pretty big. Keep in mind their \"hotness\" scale is from an Indian 1-10. I was told that a \"4\" is good enough. 

I wonder if they do the buffet to go? That would be nice-- especially for me, since I'm the only one in my family who is fond of Indian food. Otherwise I did see that they do have food delivery available.

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been only a year in Las Vegas and have been looking for a great Indian eatery. Went to Angara last night and it was phenomenal!  I highly recommend!  Their Basil/Garlic Naan is fantastic."}
{"text":"The food had the right spice and flavored.  The masalas were s bit on the salty side.   Aside from that everything was wonderful.  There yogurt sauce was one of the best.  The nan bread was very tasty and fresh.  Overall a great place to visit is you are in the mood for Indian.  There is a buffet, but we went for dinner and was not available."}
{"text":"I've had a chance to taste a lot of Indian food food and this was truely sdome of the the best. Now I only ordered the shrimp paneer but it said a lot.  First the paneer was not total paste and there was a great use of cardamom.  You couldn't tell there was oil used at all which makes me think they use ghee and yay if they do.  Really simple dish done really well.  I can't wait till I'm back again to try a lamb dish."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday night......Very authentic and colorful dishes with a lot of flavor.....Chicken Tikka Masala was very tasty and rich(the way it should be)....Naan and Peas Pilau(Yellow Rice) were both perfect....Owner was very nice and attentive....This place is a much needed addition to the Vegas Indian food scene."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight seemed like it was going to be a little rocky. But by the time we left, we were fans.

We eat late, as do many Indians, so we were a bit surprised that an hour before closing, the only two occupied tables were preparing to leave. We thought it wasn't a good sign, but the dinner experience turned out to be wonderful.

Service improved as time went on. The two TVs had Bollywood playing, and I noticed that the subtitles were in transliterated Hindi. Our waiter, Norain (sp?), cheerfully explained that Indians now use English characters instead of the Hindi ones when typing on their cellphones. He also helped me with pronunciation. As a language freak, I was thrilled to be enjoying a great dinner and learning something at the same time!

All the wines are Cupcake, a common brand that was unfamiliar to me, and I enjoyed my Riesling.

We like to order thalis, which lets us sample a variety of the foods offered. Not ever Indian restaurant offers them, but they were on the menu, vegetarian and non-. We had an Entertainment book coupon, and many Indian restaurants have allowed us to apply the value of the coupon to a thali, but not here. We were a bit miffed, especially when we discovered that rice was not included with the entrees, and was $4 extra. But the dishes we ordered, the Coconut Curry Chicken and Lamb Buna, were ample, and the rice was also a large portion. We also had Garlic Naan, which was perfectly prepared. The two entrees were delicious, and the lamb was incredibly tender and had virtually no fat.

The background music - which didn't match the Bollywood on the TVs - was very pleasant, and the ambience is relaxing.

Angara is a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is outstanding, and we'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian paradise! We arrived for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and the set up was nice; buffet, ample seating, and cozy atmosphere. The gentleman did ask which naan we preferred, and I immediately requested garlic and we were not disappointed. I was not sure what to expect and I hate to waste food, so I started off with one vegetable samosa, one spoonful of navratan korma, one spoonful of aloo gobi, and one spoonful of saag paneer, and bismati rice. My mouth was happier than Mary Poppins with a new umbrella! 

The samosa was my favorite, especially dipped in the chutney and I definitely went back for another. The runner up was the aloo gobi as I am normally a huge saag fan and not big on cauliflower. 

Angara is a good value and a quick choice if you come for the lunch buffet. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and flavorful food is what you'll find here. Lunch buffet is a great deal at $10.99. Everything was good and spiced perfectly for the general palette. Good service. Went early so there were only a few of us in the restaurant. Tandoori and tikka masala were not overcooked at all.  The restaurant is clean and well lit. Definitely coming back another time!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is fantastic. Fresh naans made to order. I love Indian food as I'm an ex Brit. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, I frequent this establishment once or twice a week for the lunch buffet. The food is always wonderful, and they have a good variety for a very good price. Plus they have vegetarian options! Today I had the veggie cakes or fritters with rice in a cream and onion sauce, a new menu item and very delicious. The restaurant is clean and the staff is always very welcoming and friendly. Overall great establishment!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant has this high rating.
The review is for Thursday lunch buffet. This place has good ambiance and service but when it comes to food, it's pretty ordinary. I didn't enjoy the food at all and probably won't be coming back again.  
Food-2.5
Ambiance-4.5
Service-4.5"}
{"text":"We discovered Himalayan/Indian Cusine in San Francisco several months back.  Although I am definitely not an expert in this Cusine I know I love great food.  Angara is our go to restaurant near home.  They have a wonderful lunch buffet that has many choices from tiki masala to curry.  The staff are very friendly and on top of everything.  Make sure you get there for the buffet before 2pm because it's the culture to close for the afternoon for a siesta before reopening for dinner at 5.  Love this place!! Check it out"}
{"text":"Excellent food. My favorite is the chicken korma and the naan is delicious!  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I'm glad Angara is officially open! My SO and I have driven by this spot numerous times hoping to finally try out another new Indian restaurant. Not to mention, it's taken the place of Custom Built, a build-your-own-pizza place that we used to love and frequent, so this location had some large shoes to fill... And I'm glad to say that it didn't disappoint! We thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience here!

Our dinner started off well with some complimentary samosas! Who wouldn't want that? The outside was crisp and flaky, the inside--a rich flavor, packed with potato and peas, and it had a good amount of heat! If you're not too into spicy food, they're really nice about toning it down for ya. Our table had the garlic naan, saag paneer, tikka masala, vegetable rice, and mango lassi.

The garlic naan was just as expected! Light in texture, but flavorful. The saag paneer was probably my least favorite, but the tikka masala made up for that. The paneer was a little bit harder than I was used to, though it was great in flavor nonetheless. I would definitely order it again! The vegetable rice went perfectly with everything we had ordered, and the mango lassi was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness!

The space is clean, well decorated, and customer service is great. Our waters were always refilled, and specific requests didn't seem to be too troubling. For lunch, they serve buffet style from 11 to 3, and dinner is restaurant style from 5 to 10. We are happy to have Angara in the neighborhood! And we will definitely come back to try out the lunch!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best butter chicken and samosas I've ever had! I love this place and for lunch it's a steel, but they don't have the butter chicken in the buffet. This place is just so good I'm so glad it's super close"}
{"text":"Yummy Indian food. I guess reading from precious reviews that this place just opened. Anyways, we will be coming back forsure."}
{"text":"Indian Lunch buffet, excellent, try it"}
{"text":"Today I went to Angara for their lunch buffet.  Indian food is probably in my top three favorite types of food, but Indian lunch buffets are a funny thing.  Even top-notch Indian restaurants can have lame buffets.  Many use lower quality meats, naan or simply have a scant selection.  An Angara, neither of those things are true.  

It's set up into three sections:  Vegetarian, Meat and Salad.  Each section had plenty to choose from and everything was high quality.  

One of things that stands out is that they bring you fresh naan with your choice of either plain or garlic.  Many Indian buffets will keep a lower quality naan on the line, but here they bring the real thing.  

They had a wonderful selection of chicken: Tikka Masala, Korma and Tandori.  The vegetarian section has super tasty Lentil, Chickpea and other veggie selections that were dynamite.  Oh, and the veggie samosas were awesome. 

You really can't go wrong for the price and now I'm looking forward to going for a dinner."}
{"text":"So super good. The man at the counter was on top of the refills and bringing out fresh hot naan. At $10.99 it is seriously the best price for an Indian buffet. 

I wish I had a second stomach for the deliciousness at this place! Everything was fresh, trays were full, temperatures on the hot foods were perfect. 

A++++"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for their lunch buffet since I moved to Vegas and this food is excellent. Almost as good as my mom's cooking. Service is excellent and very friendly. You can't go wrong here. The goat curry is amazing! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Small selection. Tandoori chicken was not dry. Honestly this was the only thing I thought worth mentioning. I am not convinced that bringing a bloodhound would've helped me detect the garlic in the garlic naan. The goat meat must've been grass fed because it was mostly bony. I honestly don't remember eating anything there that I could think of. It was a mish mash of flavors. The rice dessert which most Indian restaurants do well is not done too well here. Too much noodle. Stick with Everest if you live in Summersville. And yes, they finally refilled our glasses of water after we paid the bill. My friend paid for lunch but I probably would've added Abe Lincoln to the coinage. Not paper Abe but copper Abe. 

I was looking forward to this place after seeing the high Yelp reviews. I guess anything is ranked better than nothing when there's slim pickings. I'm siding with slim on this one."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great service and this place is clean. Lots of parking spaces, and has reasonable price."}
{"text":"I wanted try Indian food for the first time and this place was fabulous!  Food was so tasty and the portions were a good size.  Service was very pleasant.  I definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Located right next to Tropical Smoothie.

The air is aromatic of Indian spices.  The complimentary plate of crackers and sauces were great.  Our meals did take some time to prepare even though we were the only table.

Spice scale is 1-10 here.  I though 4 was good as I enjoy heat but like to keep my stomach lining.

Fish curry: a bit bland
Handi Lamb: salty. I cut it by mixing the fish curry in and it was perfect
Eggplant vegetarian dish: we took a few bites but left it mostly untouched.

Overall, the dinner menu prices were fair ($15 per plate), servers were nice, and the food was ok.  For Summerlin, any authentic sauces and dishes are wonderful.  However, if we had more time for a drive, Saino Indian- Nepali Kitchen (by Decatur and Desert Inn) would be our pick."}
{"text":"Mmmm the best tandoori chicken my favorite part is that it's not dry but instead it's juicy savory  in every bite?"}
{"text":"This restaurant actually has really great Indian food-- but it is HOT!!! Like super atomic spicy (no matter how you order it). I've ordered from this restaurant at least 10x and every time I order the food is spicier than the last. 

The last time I ordered I put in the comments on Grubhub \"MILD PLEASE MILD\"... and it arrived so, so spicy. So spicy I actually called and complained (but didn't ask for a refund).

This time, I ordered the same exact order and put \"MILD PLEASE MILD\" -- and called the restaurant immediately after placing the order to confirm I wanted the saag and masala MILD. The manager assured me they got the note.

Alas, the food arrived and it is SPICY AF. I'm guessing they probably make large quantities of each entree and can't or won't make custom orders. 

As a person the eats Sriracha by the tub-fulls, and Tabasco as a sweet treat, I can honestly say the spice of this place is on fleek if that's your jam. However, these people are clearly incapable of making anything mild, so if you have a husband/boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/kids that are sensitive to spicy food this is definitely not for you."}
{"text":"Spice level in all items is low, which would appeal to folks who prefer mildly spiced food. For Indian taste buds, definitely a no. All vegetarian items were lacking flavor and very average - Chana masala, mix veg, navratan korma etc. No paneer item. Everything was very oily. Chicken and mutton gravy were good. Gulab jamun was the best thing on the menu and was exactly as I like - warm, soft and perfect sweet level. Kheer was average."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out. And it was well worth it! $10.99 for the buffet and all the dishes were delicious! The garlic Naan was brought fresh to the table and was extremely good. Definitely coming here again for my Indian food craving."}
{"text":"Convenient location.  Open the door and the aroma of deliciousness fills sweeps over you!  Clean facility.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Lunch buffet every day starting at 11 am!  Although I would like a greater selection on the buffet (not as many as others I've tried), there is still many dishes to choose from.  The price for the buffet is reasonable.  Will definitely be going back at least monthly if not more."}
{"text":"Very delicious, aromatic Indian food.  A bit pricey as rice and naan must be ordered separately, but the ambiance and service make up for it.  Party of two - we ordered Peshawari Naan, Baigan Bharta, Chicken Coconut Curry and Vegetable Rice. Plenty for two and took some home.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This newly discovered gem has moved up to become my favorite Indian buffet! (Sorry Mint Indian Bistro.) I am addicted to this place as the food just keeps on delivering the goods. The tandoori chicken is so flavorful and juicy, The side dishes are heavenly. Their sauteed cabbage is soooo good, the potato and peas samosas and the chicken tikka masala sauce are spot on!  Their sweet donut balls (gulab jamun) are the best I've ever had! Their garlic naan is excellent too. Another thing I like is they don't jack up the price on the weekends or holidays like some other places do.(BTW Make sure to get their buy 6 get your 7th buffet free card!) The service is still top notch. A class act all the way at this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good the service was excellent...wish I can give you that last star but...food was good....missing something.....but maybe I can come back for lunch buffet...I felt like the oven baked chicken needed a little more...I'll be back tho try it and hopefully give you guys that last star"}
{"text":"Finally a good Indian restaurant on the south west side of town and what do you know? I'm moving. Anyway, this place really was excellent and I hope the owner and management read this review. Right now you're doing everything great do not change things. As time goes by and you get more successful it will be tempting to change the quality of the meat to save some money or maybe start using different samosas and I'm telling you that will be a mistake. I had the lamb korma and it was great. Samosas appeared and tasted homemade. That would be a first in any Indian restaurant I have ever been to in the Las Vegas Valley. Great job guys. The serving size was ample and filling and the naan bread tasty and not chewy. We stopped by and picked it up to go but the atmosphere of the place looked very welcoming. The only criticism that we have is they were too many tomatoes in the chicken tikka masala my love ordered, other than that it was a very good meal."}
{"text":"Went here with a few colleagues for the lunch buffet. I'm very familiar with Indian food (recently traveled there!) and the flavor of the food was very authentic. There was a great selection for the buffet, and the staff were very nice. I would definitely go back for lunch - my only regret was not stopping here sooner! :) They have a great selection of items that can be vegan/vegetarian and they are very happy to answer any questions."}
{"text":"This is a good place to sample good Indian food.  The all you can eat lunch buffet offers a varied selection of a taste of India.  My daughter ordered from the menu the chicken coconut curry which was also very good.  The service was good.  The samosas were huge and tasty.  The service was good and the restrooms were very clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Indian restaurants often but when I do, I go to Angara Indian Spice Grill. The chicken tikka masala over rice is insanely delicious, and the wait-staff are always pleasant. In all, I've been there about a dozen times and each time has been the same experience... consistently good!"}
{"text":"What a great place!
service was great
Food was great and fresh, they bake the bread to order.
And the place is clean.
They serve lunch buffet from 11-15, we will be back!
10.99 for lunch buffet"}
{"text":"I ordered on Yelp was sooo easy..... Delivery was super fast and food ..... OMG the best everything is so yummy I ordered the butter chicken its amazing! This is my new favorite place 5 stars !!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the food is consistent.   Great choices for the lunch buffer. Can't go wrong with the price"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times with my family for the buffet and are never disappointed.  Everything on the line is fresh and well prepared.  They typically have plenty of curries and dishes without meat and several chicken and goat dishes as well. Naan is prepared fresh and severed to the table.  All of this is included in the buffet.  We've never ordered off the menu here since the variety at the buffet line is what we come here for.  Service is very attentive and friendly. Come alone or with a group and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed. Ordered delivery. The food arrived fairly quickly and still nice and hot. The vegetable samosa was delicious however the chicken tikka masala, although flavorful, the chicken I got was over-cooked and felt like rubber biting into it. A lot of the pieces were also inedible because it was mostly cartilage. Maybe just a bad batch?"}
{"text":"Excellent.  I had the chicken tikka masala at a 3 with rice.  I like a little kick but not something that burns.  I also had the basil onion naan.  The naan was perfect.  They also let me know that 7 days a week they have a buffet from 11 am to 3pm.  Great way to be able to try some new stuff!  So happy to find such a great Indian place in my neighborhood.  It was reasonably priced and the service was fantastic.  It was about $35, but the portions are good.  That's two meals for me.  I even heard the guys at the table beside me saying how good their dinner was.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated since its inception, Dev Bhagat and his brother arriving in Las Vegas like so many others by way of California, it was with prior experience in the Restaurant industry that the duo opened Angara India Spice Grill in hopes of sharing the food of their homeland and doing what they love while additionally filling a market void when comparing the West side of town to East. 

First noticed after a disappointing visit to Cinnaholic, but occupying the shopping center at 4165 South Grand Canyon Drive since late 2015, it was based on positive words from trusted palates that the Lunch Buffet at Angara was explored on Saturday, a well-culled selection of traditional Indian dishes all showing well and service on par with other like concepts.

Cleanly designed and smaller than the likes of Everest or Delhi, the main dining area lined with tables and booths arranged beneath colorful murals and textured wallpaper, it was minutes past 11:00am that Suite 105 was found empty save for two others, the space quick to fill afterward and also apparently quite popular for takeout based on five orders over the course of an hour including at least one sent out via Bite Squad.

Playing regionally appropriate music at low volume, the Bollywood-style Videos always a source of amusement for those unfamiliar, it was after requesting Butter Naan over Garlic that the line-up of dishes was explored, a total of three section presenting just fifteen dishes along with an equal number of Vegetables, Chutneys, Dips and Condiments.

Not wasting time in getting started, plates in two sizes plus bowls available to avoid mixing, it was just as warm Bread arrived that a plate containing Spinach Saag plus Warm Okra with Potatoes and Onions was obtained, the former boldly-spiced but mellowed by Cream while the later found its primary constituent cooked snappy, the blend of spices pleasant and all aspects of the dish superior to American-South versions that often come across bland or soggy.

Enjoying Papadam with housemade Chutney as a sort of palate cleanser between plates, the Tamarind a bit overpowering but complex and chunky Mango quite refreshing, it was marveling at the first of three crispy Samosas that Water was refilled without having to ask, a matter of good timing as plate two featured moist Tandoori Chicken and mild Tikka Masala alongside Goat Curry almost entirely devoid of Bones but full of supple Meat plus robust spicing heavy in Coriander, Cloves and Scotch Bonnet Chiles.

Alternating between Meat and Vegetarian options, the fact that Rice dishes make up 20% of Angara's Buffet no doubt part of its low cost of just $11.99 per diner, it was shrugging off clearly frozen Peas that the Pulao came across pleasantly herbal alongside Vegetable Korma thick with Paneer and Nuts, each bite as creamy and comforting as it was delicious while the cooked Cabbage and Chickpeas heavily perfumed by Ginger were unremarkable but not necessarily bad.

Wrapping up savories with Chicken Curry, the flavor profile virtually identical to Angara  India Spice Grill's Goat version, it was after more Papadam and Samosa that two Desserts were enjoyed, the Kheer a bit thinner than versions served elsewhere while the Gulab Jamun were soft and spongy in their floral and sweet bath.

*** Too limited to rank among Las Vegas' best Indian Buffets Angara India Spice Grill nonetheless presents their spread well and at a fair price, the limitations in quantity largely offset by quality but the lack of more than four Meat choices - three of them Chicken and one virtually identical to the Goat dish - probably not enough to bring many guests back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. If you're a bit of a spice wimp like I am just make sure you ask them for really low amounts of heat!"}
{"text":"Dinner at the Angara Indian Spice Grill was fantastic.   The service was good and the prices are very reasonable.   The Lamb Vindaloo was some of the best I have had and just spicy enough to make the eyes water just a bit.   Their version of Butter Chicken was tender and delicious and, along with the Garlic and Keema Naan was a excellent meal."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Friendly service. Well priced lunch buffet (available on weekends). Good food. 

Lunch buffet is $11. Expect the standard offers in the lunch buffet. Garlic and plain naan bread options (included in buffet price). 

I recommend the mango lassi (not included in buffet) as a sweet dessert."}
{"text":"We were impressed with the service, ambience and of course-food! The lamb was fresh, the onion kulcha was incredible and their chicken was to die for. Even the sauces on the table were fresh.It is nice having Indian cuisine so fresh and close to home. Don't fear vegetarians, there's a menu just for you. The owner told us they are very close to obtaining a liquor license, even better! Can't wait to dine here again! Cheers."}
{"text":"Yeah! Happy to find this Indian restaurant in Summerlin! I was hesitant at first but after trying their buffet and mango lassi I'm relieved and happy. The atmosphere and employees are very nice and friendly. Clean, organized and the buffet is always restocked with food. I will definitely be back. Oh and the parking lot is not to bad too. I'll definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great place, amazing every time. The staff is so nice, always checks on us to make sure our order is ok. Love it here"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Attentive waiters who are very friendly. Samosas were very hot and fresh.  Overall great quality."}
{"text":"Horrid naan. I think they use frozen spinach in the saag dish. 

They actually used baby carrots (like the artificially shaped finger carrots kids have as a snack) in the vegetable korma.

The meat was not a great quality, and we just ordered chicken. 

I can't find a single halfway decent Indian restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin...We had been here before and the first time around the food was amazing! Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how we had requested so we were excited to be back. We live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. We walked into this restaurant around 9pm for dinner with my parents and grandparents. We ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani, Chicken tikka masala, Tandoori chicken, a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It's really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so we always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived it was bland, and I mean like completely bland to the point where we were drowning it in mint chutney. We asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. It was bland! We asked the server whether he had changed the spice level in the kitchen and we didn't quite get a clear answer. My grandmother tasted the Dal and she almost spit it back out on her plate and stated that it tasted old like it had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and it was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and my dad told him that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the dal and make it spicier. We quietly finished our \"dinner\" and made it very clear to the server that we wouldn't be back he didn't seem to care. My grandfather hated it so much that he actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would've been a better dinner. Needless to say I wouldn't return to this place ever again. If you're looking for good, fresh Indian food I suggest Taj Palace on Eastern and Richmar."}
{"text":"Best Indian in SW Vegas. Deliveries available through grub hub/yelp24, eating in has fast service and larger portions it seems like. Chicken Tikka Marsala and garlic pan is amazing."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for an early lunch and had the buffet. There were at least 5 different vegetarian options and that suited is just fine. We were also asked what kind of naan we wanted and they made it fresh for you - came with the buffet. The only unfortunate thing is that it's all very mild and both my husband and I are avid spice lovers."}
{"text":"I and my husband really like this place, it's very close to our home, they have awesome vegetarian food. The owner and the wait staff USA very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review regards delivery service and the food I received. I have not yet visited Angara Indian Spice Grill in person.

I had issues with the actual delivery. That's not the restaurant's fault, nor is it Eat24's nor Yelp's. I've dealt with the issue through Eat24's excellent customer support. Thanks, Suckie and Josh!

This is the second time I've ordered Indian Delivery, and the second restaurant I've ordered delivery from. I had the Chicken Korma, the Chicken Tikka, plain naan, and those funny little fried doodles that I can never remember the name of.

This is why I withheld one star: Can't ANY Indian restaurant in Las Vegas make a curry mild when the  menu SAYS \"mild\" and even offers you options for spiciness? All the food was very flavorful; not one dish (except the naan, of course) was \"mild.\" I like spicy food, but my tolerance for it has weakened as I grow older (don't tell me this hasn't happened to you or someone you know!).

Okay.
The fried thingies: oddly bland, even though the batter was SPICY.
Chicken tikka: Surprisingly moist and tender! Beautiful color. SPICY.
Chicken Korma: Subtle blend of flavors, noted as MILD on the menu, but guess what? It was SPICY!
Naan: a bit dry, missing that buttery caress. This was the only thing that was NOT spicy. 

Even the tamarind sauce was SPICY!

Bottom line: I will order from here again, but only when I'm in the mood for a mouth-searing meal. The flavors were excellent, and I could eat the Chicken Tikka every night for a week, and even make sandwiches from it (think cucumber slices and raita on a folded naan or in a pita). But I'll continue my search for an Indian restaurant that is more in line with my perception of \"mild,\" \"medium,\" and \"SPICY!\"

So
5 stars minus 1, because you pretty much want something mild when you order something that's described, in the menu, as mild!"}
{"text":"A much welcomed addition to the Indian buffet scene on the west side. This buffet was every bit as good as our favorite places, Tamba and India Palace. You get the usual choices in the buffet: tandoori, tikka masala, saag, veggie korma. The chicken korma was a new one. Piping hot naan and lots of ice in the glass of water which was refilled without having to ask. Never understand why some Indian places serve luke warm water with no ice. Best part is you can have both kheer and gulab jamen for dessert and they were great. Only negative was the TV that was blasting some Bollywood version of Sabado Gigante (idiocy). Anyway, thoroughly enjoyed this food and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I just HAD to get my tikka masala fix, so I took my mom out on a brunch date here. We had no idea what to expect since it was both our first time checking out this place, but we were certainly NOT disappointed.

First and foremost, they had a very clean and welcoming environment. The buffet section had a good amount of dishes ranging from a small salad bar to the main entrees. We got to meet the chef William, who was very friendly and made a point to chat with every customer that was in the restaurant. He told us that Monday's are he best days to come for the buffet since the selections often change every day. I got to try nearly every dish (except for the goat curry) and of course my favorite was the masala. Every dish was seasoned and cooked perfectly! You can really taste the spiciness without it overpowering the actual dish. When it came to dessert, I had the gulab jamun (which is essentially a milk-based fried ball in syrup) and the tamarind chutney. Both super delicious, although I do not recommend eating them together since both flavors are profoundly on opposite spectrums. 

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves or wants to try Indian food. & by the way, the buffet was only $10.99. Very good deal!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten Indian food at in Las Vegas and they have a lunch buffet!!! Came in to try this place after passing by so many times and let me tell you, they are legit! Very clean/nice restaurant, the customer service was 5 stars and the food. These are just a couple of my faves."}
{"text":"We were so fortunate to stumble upon this place. We arrived just as the lunch buffet started. The atmosphere is stunning. It gives you a fine dining feel when you walk in. I tried the chicken curry first and it was delicious! Then I tried just about everything else and was equally impressed. Angara is also reasonably priced. Great service! Great food!"}
{"text":"It pains me to write a negative review of this place, having had some good experiences here in the beginning but after several VERY disappointing meals delivered both by bitesquad and taken to go, I felt the need to share my experience in the hopes the owners/chef make some changes. I will add, I am relatively new to Indian food so I don't proclaim to be an expert. Our first visit was very good, I thought the Naan bread was a little thin and overdone, but improved on the second batch and later visits. Butter chicken was initially good, but after the second or third visits, then ordering take out and delivery on two occasions the quality dropped significantly. This last order, I was really craving butter chicken and begged my husband to give them another shot - hoping this would be the turnaround meal. We ordered the garlic shrimp, butter chicken, jasmine rice (because the last time we ordered the peas pilau we actually got vegetable rice instead.) The garlic shrimp was not what we expected, full of bell pepper, onions and no hint of garlic - but being newer to Indian cuisine I'm sure that error was based on our expectation versus the reality of this dish. On the flip side the menu didn't describe the dish in any way, so that's really what my review is based on. The real reason for my poor review though is based on the butter chicken. The pieces of chicken are pathetically small and sparse. On top of that, there was gristle and cartilage in this last batch, and the consistency is seasoning has been very all over the place. Going from almost too hot to eat at a spice level of 2 to bland and no heat at a 1. I was initially excited about this place and the people that work/own the place are really nice and sweet. But IMO there's no excuse for charging $14.99 for a dish with barely any chicken and with some seriously poor quality control."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  Lunch buffet was awesome.  There were a few different meat dishes, vegetable samosa, etched, etc..  The flavor of everything was great with just the right kick.  I really really enjoyed the chicken tiki marsala.  Oh and after 3 plates I was even asked if I would like a box to go.  Wow, great service!  ...but I declined having already stuffed myself.  Do yourself a favor and go there...now!"}
{"text":"Great Indian buffet.  Clean restaurant, staff is friendly and  quick.  The food was really well prepared.  Had just the right spice.  The goat was tender and the chicken as well.  I find that if you cube chicken in a dish and cook it becomes tough and over cooked.  Not in this case very tender.  Overall I give this a 5 star rating and from me that hard to earn.  Amhara keep up the good work and excellent standards."}
{"text":"Very good food and away from the strip!!  Everything is delicious and staff is very friendly.  Sorry no alcohol yet."}
{"text":"I hope this place is here to stay!
It's new, cozy, and not too loud. The server was very attentive, and the food came out hot and quick. We were here for dinner so I didn't get to try the lunch buffet. 

The spicy level is 1-10 so if you think there's not enough flavor, that's on you. Mine was just right! 
There's cool Indian music videos playing on TV screens. They don't have their beer/wine license yet, but they said they are getting it soon."}
{"text":"Great food, Excellence service! We just moved to Las Vegas and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant. We heard great things about this place until we came. Love the goat curry and the garlic naan."}
{"text":"My wife and I were celebrating out 16th wedding anniversary yesterday and wanted to try something different, so we decided to try out an Indian Restaurant in Summerlin. It was my first time eating at an Indian Restaurant and the experience was great from the start! Upon entering, we were greeted by a couple of the staff members and immediately ushered to a booth. One of the waiters brought out a thin bread and chutney and a tamarind sauce, kind of like chips and salsa. Drinks and entrees were ordered by way of a recommendation by our waiter. I had the Chicken Tikki Masala and my wife had the Spicy Coconut Curry, which was excellent with the Basmati rice. I'm not an expert in Indian cuisine, but I did enjoy the flavors of both dishes. The portions were more than adequate, so we took home some leftovers. 

Aside from the food, the restaurant was clean and the entire staff was friendly and very accommodating. The prices were reasonable and we definitely will be visiting this fine establishment again to try out their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Great service & great food. Lunch buffet is $10.99 from 11AM-3PM Monday through Sunday, glad it's so close to my home."}
{"text":"Excellent dishes and very good delivery service. We ordered a few items and shared them, Chicken Tika, Lamb Vindaloo and Lamb Kebab. Very relish!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've ever had. 
I was greeted by Ric & he was warm and pleasant gentlemen . I enjoy chicken curry & tandoori , chicken tikka Masala 
Navratan korma & Basmati rice. Thank you for the wonderful kind service"}
{"text":"Won't be returning here - spice levels were way off, food not worth $. The entrees were way over-spiced (details below) while the Garlic Naan was flavorless. Normally I like spicy food (and so does my eldest son) but since we wanted to share with my youngest and my wife we only asked for a spice level of 3 (on the 1-10 scale the waiter told us) - but both the Lamb Curry and Shrimp Saag were too spicy to eat! I can't recall paying $14.99 for a small entrée and then leaving 80% on the plate (and no one wanted a to-go container on it). My youngest ordered Chicken Biryani with the least spice possible (1 on a 1-10 scale) and it was too spicy for 3 of 4 diners to eat. The waiter was good - and he put in the orders correctly, as the receipt reflects the correct spice levels - but the cook made every entrée radically spicy. If they said up front \"every meal is super spicy\" that would be one thing, but to pretend that you can tailor the spice level and then serve the spiciest rice I have ever had (when the customer ordered the lowest) doesn't work. Also a bit pricy - $15 entrée does not include even steamed rice (extra $4). So in the end it was more expensive than other Indian food here in Las Vegas, and less edible. Would suggest you instead try Mount Everest, India Oven, or Curry Leaf (my favorite)."}
{"text":"I really wish I could come here for lunch. I love it when you can eat Indian food with a little bit of this and that. It is not at all busy at dinner time. The prices range from $12-$18 for main entrees. We ordered chicken korma and some lamb. I don't remember the name of the dish but if you look in the menu it is the first menu item on the lamb/goat section. We also ordered some garlic naan and a house salad. 

The food portions are a bit small but very flavorful. I liked both of the meat dishes that we ordered. Again, I wish that they would just have the buffet all day. The salad was okay. It did not come with any dressing just lemons. We ordered raita for the salad. 

Service was up to par! Our water was always refilled before it ever ran out, so that's always nice especially when you are eating spicy foods. 

I suggest coming here for lunch when the buffet is up."}
{"text":"I must say I was surprised by Angara India Spice Grill tonight. I arrived around 8:15p and there was only 1 couple sitting in the restaurant. Unsure if I wanted take out or dine in, I took a few moments to browse the menu and look around. The restaurant lights were low, however it was clean and tidy with table dressings. So far so good, I'm thinking in my head. I finally decided to dine in, and in glad I did! Water was offered immediately, along with the flat bread and spices and menu. I must add that it did take roughly 5-7 mins. to be seated due to there only being 1 server doing it all...taking phone orders and servicing the dining area, but later turned into two servers. Let me fast forward, after ordering around 8:30p the food took 15-20 mins to prepare and was served nice and hot. I enjoyed the level 5 spice from 1-10, and it wasn't spicy at all. This could have been a plus because, I was able to enjoy the flavors and freshness of the chicken Tikka Masala & garlic naan breard with a side of rice. Yes, I had plenty of carbs tonight, and all for under $25.00 with a 20% tip ;-) If, you were to ask would I return, I'd have to say YES, with family and friends. BTW, portions are a nice size and can be shared by two easily!

Sorry pic is dark, my camera battery was giving out on me. Enjoy if you plan on going!"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Indian food I've had in a loooooooong time! We had the chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma entrees. Both were juicy, flavorful and the perfect spice settings for what we ordered (spicy and mild). We also had the naan and samosas- delicious! 

We also had everything delivered with bite squad. They were super fast and we are definitely going to be regulars here!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant find for 2017!  The samosas are amazing!  My wife loves the chicken curry & the lamb rogan josh is excellent.  Their service is great too!  We will definitely be back often."}
