{"text":"Stopped by and had a slice of pizza. Pizza was good and the girls at the counter were very friendly. They even threw in a couple garlic knots. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Phone number is not accurate. When I asked if this was NY Pizzeria, was told it was not."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time because we got a flier at our door saying \"now open!\" Yet when I calles to order boneless chicken wings they said they were out. Who opens without all of their menu items in stock? But, whatever. I frantically flipped through their menu before deciding I'd just do the regular wings, and an order of garlic knots for delivery.
I got a call from them a while later saying *I* must have given them the wrong address because the delivery guy cant find it. I think I know my own address, but okay, I give it to them again. Delivery guy shows up and asks if Ive paid already. I realize after being distracted by going through the menu i plum forgot, and I didnt have cash nor did the lady i had ordered from asked me for a credit card. So i call them back to ask if they can take the credit card now. She says in this snarky tone; \"i just assumed it was cash, next time you really need to say if its not!\" Pretty sure most places just ask! But she took my information and i got my food. 
Wish I hadnt. The wings were seriously terrible. The box was dripping sauce everywhere and the sauce itself was nasty. I ate one before I threw the whole box away. It came with bottled ranch. The garlic knots were really just bread knots. No garlic at all, and the marinara was plain and sad. 
To top it off, when I looked at my recepit my address was on it, the correct numbers except she left off the last two. So i had definitly given it to her correctly. 
All in all it was a terrible experience. I ended ip eating a pizza lunchable for dinner because yeah, those wings were that bad."}
