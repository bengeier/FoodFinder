{"text":"We're kinda new to northern chinese cuisine.  the dining area wasn't super full when we visited, this is our 2nd visit as of this writing.

Yuan Yuan took the space in the plaza where Spicy Garden used to be.

Service is typical chinese service - kinda rude, so nothing new there

As for the food : we ordered braised pork burger, scallion pancakes, soft tofu soup, potatoes and garlic & seafood noodles.

braised pork burger : ok meat to fat ratio, not enough sauce, good ratio of amount of pork filling to the bun, bun was crispy on the outside, but the bottom half of the bun was kinda thick.

scallion pancakes : nice and crispy but barely any scallions

soft tofu soup : both myself and the wife enjoyed this, kinda like dessert tofu with a lightly sweet soup, down side was we only ordered the small size :)

potatoes and garlic : first time trying this, has some hot oil, not super spicy at all, would order again.

seafood noodles : nothing super fancy about these noodles, lightly sauced a bit on the oily side.  Likely not to order this one again.  Note : their noodle selection is very few.

Likely to visit again to try other dishes.

This resto accepts cash & debit, uncertain as of this writing on credit card"}
{"text":"Yuan Yuan is pretty good. It's certainly unexceptional, but I'd definitely consider going there again if I'm ever in the area.

The restaurant was pretty empty when my friends and I walked in for dinner at 7:00pm. That's usually a bad sign, but my friends who live in the area sang high praises of it. The restaurant filled up eventually as we began eating.

For $10 to $15, you can have A LOT of food. I'm talking a plate of fried rice (easily enough for two people to have their fill) for $7. Unlike a lot of similar Chinese restaurants that I've been to, they actually take debit cards.

As for recommendations, I'd give the soft tofu soup, the Young Chow fried rice, and the dumplings a go. They were the highlights of my meal."}
{"text":"Yuan Yuan is a simple Chinese restaurant with decent dishes and great price. 

The best way I can describe this place is everything taste homemade. As in, it tastes great but it's not what you're used to eating at a restaurant, it's similar but something is different. 

Anyways, for the price, it's definitely worth your time. I'd recommend trying this place when you have the chance."}
{"text":"When my friend told me there is a new restaurant call Yuan Yuan, just opens up in Richlane, of course I need to give it a try.

This is the 2nd location of Yuan Yuan in Scarborough which is known for their Tian Jian cuisine.

The restaurant is a lot nicer and spacious than the one in original location. The new owner kept the deco and the setup of the previous restaurant and basically just change the business name in the storefront. 

Steamed Chives and Pork Dumplings ($4.99) freshly prepares when order took around 20 minute. Dumplings were bite size, savory and filled with soup!!!

Sesame Pancake ($2.99) was decent as a filler. So hot and fresh!!

No Lunch Special but at this price point everything here is a bargain: Scarborough pricing in Richmond Hill.

You can watch the lady preparing dumplings right in front of the restaurant. 

Cash Only."}
{"text":"I don't know where the exceedingly negative opinion on the food came from, but from my one and only one visit to Yuan Yuan, the food was decent and the services, though slow, was friendly.

We came for dinner and ordered a Jellyfish Salad appetizer ($7), a Fish Filet Cooked with Sour Pickled Chinese Vegetable ($12) and a Mixed Vegetables Stir Fry ($9).  All three dishes were quite well made.  The jellyfish was thick and fresh and the sauce was a nice mix of sesame oil, vinegar and chili.  The Fish Filet Cooked in Sour Pickled Chinese Vegetable was very tasty (sour) but not overwhelming. It was not spicy.  It may not be sour enough for some, but to this Cantonese native, it was delicious.  The Mixed Vegetables Stir Fry was steaming hot.  It tasted delicate, or bland if you prefer it salty.  However, for this particular meal, the blandness was refreshing against the sourness of the fish filet dish.

What really stood out was that the ingredients of all 3 dishes were impressively fresh.  It was impressive because I expected less from the humble appearance of the restaurant.  Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise."}
