{"text":"Got the combo plate, which was fun and delicious! Service was very friendly and attentive. Don't miss the coffee! Also, don't be deterred by the appearance from the outside, or it's location in a semi-strip mall of liquor and pizza joints - it's great!"}
{"text":"I loved this place for following reasons:

Great service, as it is run by the family - they treat every customer like 'family'.  Truly that is so missing in most places that come across customer-servicing but not really authentic. I love this guys, they are amazing!

The food - OMG it tastes amazing! also it's so close to Indian in spices and appearance, may be I am a bit biased but never-the-less they make it yummy tasting!

Ambiance - obviously you won't find it materialistic rich but it speaks Ethiopian, their culture and simplicity. 

I will go back again and again....:)

Note: Don't be fooled by the not-so-good-looking shops or neighborhood. This place really needs to be checked out once and you'll not complain!"}
{"text":"Our agency has ordered delivery from this restaurant several times.  The food is always delicious and healthy. We love this place and will keep ordering from there!"}
{"text":"We go here pretty regularly so obviously our opinion is positive.  The service is friendly if not hyper efficient or attendant. The food is consistently good quality w veg dishes generally stronger than meat."}
{"text":"OK ... My first comment/question has nothing to do with this restaurant, per se; but maybe someone can help me out:  I've been to four different Ethiopian restaurants in PHX so far and three of the four have clear, plastic tablecloths on the tables.  Is there something I'm missing?  Is my grandmother driving to Ethiopian restaurants and covering their tables with plastic?  If they had couches, would those be covered in plastic, too?

Elderly-grandmother decorating aside -- and in a hot place like PHX, plastic tablecloths can actually be an uncomfortable decoration to have -- it's true, as one reviewer wrote, that decoration is basic.  And ceiling fans would probably make a big difference to making the place feel a little less hot and claustrophobic, too.  I also read a few people's comments about it taking 45 minutes for the food to come out.  Perhaps because there were only a very few people when we arrived our food only took 15 minutes to come out, but I saw no sign of foot dragging here.

We had the combo meat and veggie platter, as we have at every Ethiopian restaurant we go to.  It's gotten to a point, where we've convinced ourselves, that true Ethiopian food only comes in mixed platters.  

How did this platter stack up?  Well, as far as it being good for two, as they claim on the menu, I would say, that unless you are very healthy eaters (\"healthy\" as in \"gluttonous\"), the claim is justified.  But you won't be bursting at the seams when you're done (and, here's a hint:  you're not supposed to when you eat in a healthy manner).  Still, if you DO like to eat, two people splitting this might not work.

One reviewer wrote, that for $11.99 for two people (the cost of the platter), you couldn't beat the price.  That's true.  However, to be fair, I should point out, that for $2.00 more, the same platter is much larger at Gojo, has more items, more bread and is much tastier.  That is NOT to say, that this platter is not worth every penny of the $11.99.  Let's just say, if you're REALLY hungry, you'll want to order this at Gojo and pay the extra $2.00.

The owners are quite friendly and always ready to give advice, converse and do Ethiopian food justice (though they're not Ethiopian ... ask them where they're from and let's see how geographically savvy you are!).

We decided, that this place is well worth the hype it gets.  We still like Gojo better for several reasons.  But if aliens dropped down from one of Saturn's moons and kidnapped the cook at Gojo, we would definitely pick this as an alternate place instead of slitting our wrists in despair.

Well done.

OH!  One VERY important postscript:  this place has a dinner buffet for a very reasonable price on Friday nights.  Considering the only evening buffets I've ever seen in the Valley at nights were Chinese  (most other places I've run into have buffets for lunch only), the buffet is probably a fantastic deal.  (Though I'm not sure I have any stretch-pants left in the closet to risk it)."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise!  Do not be deterred by the location or looks! While the restaurant was quite empty on a Sunday night at 730, we were greeted like friends and ate an amazing vegetarian meal. We ordered the vegetarian combo plate and it was more than enough for my boyfriend and me.  It was full of flavor and perfect combinations of spice, sweetness and a touch of sour to dip with excellent injera. we were treated to a taste of Ethiopian coffee (very sweetened) and they had just pan-roasted it, bringing the beans out to us to smell before making the coffee!  We will definitely be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This place truly has blown my mind.  It is definitely the best.  The lady who served us was super sweet and hospitable.  I truly loved it.  I will definitely return.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is ethnic, and interesting.  It feels like your in another country; the customs are different and everyone is different from you and doin their own thang.  I liked it for that aspect.  However, the service takes a long time, so make sure you have the at least two hours to kill.  Also make sure you go with a few people, the cuisine is like chinese where you share all the dishes.  Also you might want to bring a bottle of water, they don't serve you your drinks until they serve your food. 

While I appreciate ethnic food, this was my first time trying Ethiopian.  There are many more meet dishes than I expected.  I have to admit there were left overs from our party of three, and I didn't eat mine, and neither did my friend who is an ardent believer in not wasting anything and an African from Tazania??

The coffee is good by the way.  They serve it at the end as well in a little tiny tea cup, but very flavorful rich tasting coffee, that even I who drink my coffee black, needed to add a itsy bitsy teespoon of sugar."}
{"text":"Great value. Delicious food. Friendly staff.

I totally passed by it while driving though, since it wasn't well lit. Maybe the sign was off, or there was no lit sign. Either way, I'm glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is very authentic. The ginger coffee was delicious. The owner was very kind to my girlfriend and me. She told us that she buys coffee directly from Ethiopian farmers. This makes it so her coffee is more authentic and it provides more money to the farmers themselves. I strongly recommend visiting this place!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went for a leisurely mid-afternoon lunch and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Solid Ethiopian food and friendly folks.  Not the place to go if you're on limited time, but make it a destination with some friends and you'll love it.  

If you're new to Ethiopian food, it's served communally on injeera, a crepe-like bread made from teff grain (an addiction of mine, I have to admit).  The dishes, meat and/or vegetable, are thickly stewed and heaped on the injeera; you tear off a piece and use it to scoop up the food.  My friends asked for forks to help, but I just dug in--hope you will, too, as it's half the fun of the experience.  Portions are generous (we had three substantial servings plus four more from our leftovers of one meat and one vegetable dish).  I won't go into the individual dishes, you just can't go wrong here.

And don't, by any means, skip the Ethiopian coffee service at the end of your meal.  Beans are roasted and ground on the spot (love the smell), then brewed over an open flame and poured into lovely demitasse cups.  Add some sugar, and . . . dessert!

BTW, the New Times mini-review said the restaurant is \"in the back of a convenience store.\"  That info will help you figure out how to get into it (there's no \"front,\" just a door), but it doesn't do justice to the Ethiopian market out front, which covers everything Ethiopian from colorful headscarves to cooking pots.  Be sure to stop on the way out for a tub of halawa (similar to halvah, which you may be more familiar with).  The sesame candy will keep you happy until your next visit."}
{"text":"Cheaper than Lalibela and perhaps even more delicious! The food is amazing. I shared #5, the beef and lamb combination, with a friend, and we had some left over (and I eat a lot). 

We stayed for the traditional coffee, and it was SO great. It takes some time, so don't order the traditional coffee if you're in a rush. My friend, who spent time in Ethiopia, was so happy to have this experience again; it brought back all the memories.

You can munch on fresh popcorn and smell burning incense while the green coffee beans are roasting. They're roasted DARK! Then, the beans ground and freshly brewed in a beautiful pot. Served in tiny cups with or without sugar.

I can't wait to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan.  This place has great Ethiopian food.  I prefer their flavors better than Lalibella and Blue Nile.  Their prices are also comparable.  The service, however, is a bit lacking.  We ordered hot teas and were never once asked for a refill.  We also purchased bottle water because we were not sure if they offered regular tap water on ice.  But this restaurant has only been open for about four weeks.  So, hopefully they can improve on the service issues.  
We tried a variety of  meat dishes.  They were all really good.  Very flavorful and each dish had its own distinct flavor. Next time we will get less meet and some veggies."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth visiting.  The food, and the eating experience are unique and enjoyable.  Service is great."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Ethiopian Famous Restaurant & Coffee. Abebech, the warm, friendly proprietor, welcomed us into her restaurant and provided excellent service and a memorable experience. My husband and I also enjoyed a coffee ceremony, and Abebech spent some time with us and answered our many questions about the service, the roasting process, and the ritual. She also cooks amazing vegetarian food! Don't miss out on this very rare and special gem!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the lamb combo which is suppose to consists of 2 sides of your choosing. Unfortunately several items that were listed on the menu were unavailable. My friend said this was the second time it has happened to her here. If the rating was for food alone, I would give them 4 stars as the spice in the dishes was just right for me. Also we were the only table there, but we had to wait a while before we got our check. Overall the place has pretty good food."}
{"text":"A must for anyone with a taste for international cuisine.

My wife and I shared the meat combo and vegetarian combo... Both were amazing, even our eight month old was eating the lentil dish.

They brought lightly sugared popcorn out after dinner and we polished off a pot of Ethiopian coffee (it's similar to Turkish coffee and is best without sugar). 

Definitely worth the trip and worthy of a repeat visit."}
{"text":"We love this place so much that we celebrated my nephews bday here. I love the owner... Sorry I don't know her name.     :( but she and he family are so welcoming and always remembers us. 
Today we also requested the coffee ceremony. It was lovely! We will continue coming.
Don't come here if you are in a hurry, eating is a social event and you want to enjoy the food and the time there. You will find yourself socializing with those in your table and the people in the restaurant too.
If you are in a hurry, call in to place your order."}
{"text":"Vegetarian number three is delicious, and more than enough for two people.  First time here, we ordered the coffee.  Hand roasted for you while you wait. So be patient.  It's only a hour and its well worth it.  It feels like I'm in someones house, and I love that homey relaxed feeling!  The prices are cheaper than Lali Bela, and the flavorful food and tentative service is what will bring me back. Cannot wait until next time! Really great experience."}
{"text":"Hey--it's an Ethiopian restaurant in Phx!!  What it lacks in decor, it makes up in the fact that it is prepared to order in the small kitchen in the back.  Definitely feels like you've stepped into another country, however, the food takes FOREVER to come out...be prepared to spend a good 45 min to an hour waiting for it.

I got a vegetarian dish and was not impressed.  Definitely not as good as other spots in the valley (like Lalibela).  So, if you're veggie, skip this place or don't expect to be as satisfied as the carnivores."}
{"text":"Fifteen of us came to this Ethiopian restaurant to celebrate a dear friend's birthday and the Ethiopian New Year. It was a momentous occasion, we were pleased to find the interior spaciously arranged with a family friendly atmosphere. We were seated at the long rectangular table in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by colorful cultural artifacts. There was also a designated area for their well-documented coffee ceremony. 

The food took a long time to simmer, but it was worth the wait once the three giant platters reached our table. The bed of thick fluffy injera was stacked with Beyaynetu Combination. The meat combination included Beef Kaywot, Alicha, Doro Wot, Minchetabesh, and vegetables. Unfortunately, the beef cubes were slightly dry. Otherwise, everything from the chicken leg, minced beef, and the saucy seasonings was robust and noteworthy. The differentiation between savory, garlicky, and spicy flavors was distinct and extensive. On this occasion, I especially enjoyed the Doro Wot, the hard-boiled eggs, and the Minchetabesh.

The platter also included the Ye-strom Beyaynetu that came with Miser Kik, Alicha Kik, Green Lentil, and three portions of vegetables. The different types of lentils were spectacular. The seasonings were robust with noticeable textures here and there. Equally impressive was the Collard Greens that added contrast to the sweet White Cabbage made with onion, garlic, and turmeric sauce. Some of the items could be spicier, but I'm glad we kept it safe for the younger members of the dinner party.

We also ordered the Key Tibs that came with sautéed beef with butter, seasoned onions, green peppers, and rosemary. More importantly, this marks the first time that I tried Kitfo, a prime beef dish that is often served raw. I must say, the Kitfo was absolutely delicious. The mix of spiced butter, mimita, and homemade cottage cheese made this dish worth getting. 

The owner of the restaurant was so kind to offer us complimentary Coffee Ceremony. The abbreviated version of the ceremony consisted of roasting of coffee beans with cinnamon that filled the room with a rich aroma. The coffee was then served and passed around the table as a finisher. 

Even though parking was plentiful in the strip mall, the corner liquor store was quick to call the tow truck on cars that were parked in front. In all, the meal cost each person $20 with tax and gratuity. The injera was plentiful, and service was attentive, accommodating, and friendly. As we were finishing our coffee the server distributed Ethiopian candies and popcorn to the little ones. The only two limitations that interested diners should be aware of are 1) the wait time for food, 2) the food is on the greasy side compared to others I have been to. Otherwise, many of us at the table believe this was the best Ethiopian restaurant in the area. In the end, we had plenty of leftovers to take home. I'd love to eventually return to try their lamb dishes and breakfast items."}
{"text":"So I have only ordered the food take-out but it is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I have had Ethiopian food several times back East and was not expecting much from Phoenix fare, but this food blew my mind. The injera is the tastiest I have ever had - I usually dislike it due to blandness but not this time. I started eating it without toppings even! Their lentil dishes are perfectly seasoned and just a tad spicy. They make everything fresh and the food definitely reflects their care and love for their culture and cuisine. Not greasy or too oily at all. Tons of variety and prices are cheap!  Two people combo for only $11.99 - can't beat that.

The restaurant transferred ownership around May 2013 to two delightful young women who now make all the food and run the place. I will be going this weekend with the boyfriend to have food and coffee in the restaurant and will review after that \"dine-in\" experience. 
Here's to more cultural and diverse eating in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We ordered the meat and veggie combos for the table and everything was excellent. The dinner was topped off with the fresh roasted coffee and a tasty bread. 

The staff was very friendly and we had a good time talking about the food and the coffee. Make time to make this place a habit and keep them in the neighborhood. 

Parking in front and plenty of parking in the back. They also have takeout but it was such a delightful experience that I would hate to miss the time in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had an incredible experience tonight. Delicious food and a unique coffee ceremony. Freshly roasted beans!! The coffee was so excellent I bought the traditional ceramic coffee pot. A truly fabulous experience!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"meh\" - everything seemed lacking here --- lackluster service, bland food -- it just wasn't a hit (and at $20 for two for lunch it was a definite \"not again\")

Atmosphere was dreary

Lamb (yebeg kilkil) was a bit dreary -- a mixture of ground lamb and lamb chunks -- very watery sauce --- wicked sweet

Yellow beans were good --- nothing amazing

Injera bread = OK --- a little more dense than I like

But definitely dreary atmosphere --- went at 12:30 on a Friday --- no one but a few Ethiopian regulars eating alone, dark, plastic tablecloth, grimy feel

Still looking for that nice \"go-to\" Ethiopian restaurant in Phoenix --- need one, this not it"}
{"text":"Ethiopian Famous Restaurant and Coffee on E McDowell is unexpectedly located in a petite corner mall at 41 Street and McDowell.  Thankfully there is a large sign out front so I didn't miss it.

This was my third visit to an Ethiopian restaurant. I prefer eating food that looks whole, but for some reason I really get down with the how-many-dollops-of-food-can-we-fit-atop-this-­injera-round that Ehiopian cuisine is known for.
(Oh no, I just ended a sentence with a preposition.)

I showed up at the crack of lunchtime to grab some grub on a combination platter.  Unfortunately they were out of a lot of ingredients, so I resorted to what the cook could feed me.  Ye-misir wot (red lentils), kik alicha (yellow peas), gomen (collard greens), tikle gomen (cabbage and carrot) without the carrot, and a couple of other veggie things - can't remember the names.  Flavor and jalapenos were prevalent and tickled my tongue but I couldn't stop eating.  

Food was good.
It went in good
and came out even better the next day.
Ahhhh.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Beware of this place! I drove 20 mins to this place on monday around 5PM and place had a closed sign. Walked inside and was told that they were closed. What a waste of time!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Combo meal, and it was very appetizing! Ethiopian coffee was amazing, strong fresh floral to the taste.  Highly recommend this place if you are looking for new healthy delicious meals."}
{"text":"insanely good. I have brought several groups and have never been disappointed. the large shared meals come on a round tray, about the size of a pizza tray. great mix of flavors & spices. if you've never had Ethiopian, it's similar to Indian and very unique. the owners & staff are all Ethiopian and it is super authentic."}
{"text":"Ethipoian food is my favorite cuisine and perfect for vegetarians out there.  This particular Ethiopian resturant has the best injera compared to other Ethiopian restaurants in Phoenix-really flavorful!  The owner told me it's because they use 100% teff flour and other places cut their injera with wheat flour.  I used to go here exclusively for to-go food because the ambience of the place was dreary.  Recently, however; they reinvested some money into sprucing the place up and now I don't mind dining in.  They added a bar and improved the lightening and it is more inviting now.  I would recommend getting the veggie combo and letting the chef choose your sides.  They will give you what's fresh and available that day."}
{"text":"Who would have thought eating without utensils could be so enjoyable?

The first time I ate here, I had no idea what to expect. My only other experience with Ethiopian food wasn't favorable, but I'm always willing to give food another chance. And I'm glad I did!

Ethiopian Famous Restaurant is an experience of its own. Tucked away in the back room of an African grocery store, it's unpretentious and very basic by all appearances. The food, however, stands out. I prefer the meat dishes over the vegetarian options, but that's not to suggest the latter isn't flavorful and fulfilling. I just really like meat.

Everyone I've taken here is initially skeptical--will they serve me dirty water and boiled rice?; am I going to get shot in that neighborhood? But upon eating here, they have all agreed that Ethiopian Famous is truly a remarkable restaurant."}
