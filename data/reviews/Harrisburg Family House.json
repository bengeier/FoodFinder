{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is that too many people like it, and it gets too crowded."}
{"text":"Food very tasty, very clean, service is very good and quick. I had country ham breakfast with hash brows , cooked perfectly. I highly recommend this resteraunt."}
{"text":"Our first visit.  The parking lot is always full.  But the wait time was short.  Had breakfast waffle with fresh strawberries.  The biscuits were also good.  Service and price was good.  Will be back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and reasonably priced. Go for the breakfast special, it can't be beat! All around good experience"}
{"text":"Nice large portions.  Decent price.  Good decent meals.  Nothing bad or outstanding comes to mind."}
{"text":"Food and service also great! 
Very friendly waitresses with a pleasant atmosphere! Clean and always a good sanitation rating. Very crowded on the weekends -"}
{"text":"Been here on few occasions. Place is always packed. Its an average place with decent food. I'm assuming in a land of francise fast food on every corner a place the actually cooks food gets rave reviews. I had an elastic in my spinach pie once. I'm brave though, I ordered it again another time! It was ok but somewhat soggy. You can't reheat spinach pie in a microwave so endure the wait and ask for the oven. Nothing special just a place to eat."}
{"text":"My inlaws took me here for dinner right now and I was actually a little surprised by how much I enjoyed it here!

We had onion rings for an appetizer and they were crispy and had just enough onion flavour to be perfect in my eyes, and I ordered the Athens beef strips with fried squash and sweet potatoes as my sides. Honestly, as somebody who ate rice growing up like, every day I wasn't thrilled with the instant rice it came with, but the beef was tender and flavourful, and the fried squash was fresh and hot. I'm probably weird in that I save my sweet potatoes for dessert but I'm glad I did. Dessert in the case looked really good but I didn't have room."}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here very often. They have great basic breakfast, no frills, just good food!"}
{"text":"I will never understand why people are so crazy about this place. It's definitely nothing special. We finally went for breakfast because we've heard people going on and on about it. It was a huge disappointment. The grits were flavorless and The eggs were a joke. How do you mess up eggs?? We should have just gone to Louis's instead!"}
{"text":"food is always on point!!!!! besides the hill billies and nc state troopers givin ya the evil eye you will enjoy the food!!!! and the livermush is fire!!!! customer service is amazing!!!! cakes on fire too"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here regularly. The food is very good and they have a nice variety. The Italian.selections are fantastic. Especially the baked ziti. Also, great service!"}
{"text":"Well, we've been living in Harrisburg now for 9 years and have never thought of giving this place a try.  Then the hubby and I decided to go out for breakfast and didn't want to go too far and this place seemed like the perfect spot.  Now on to the experience...

The outside of the restaurant and even the decor on the inside has a nice old time country feel. Nice and cozy.  The wait time was about 10 minutes on a Friday morning, not too bad but when we sat down I don't think the waitress knew we were there because we sat there almost another 10 minutes and saw her tend to a couple that came in after us.  Anyway, a busser realized it and must have said something to someone because then she came over to us and took care us.  Hey, it happens sometimes at least she came over promptly afterwards.  Now the food....

We ordered the Strawberry Waffle Combo, Pancake Combo and a side order of French Toast.  I must say they are VERY GENEROUS with their portions.  The food didn't taste pre-frozen, pre-made or out of a can.  It taste like it was cooked to order.  The food was pretty good and cheap.  Why go to IHOP when you can get a better breakfast meal here."}
{"text":"So after my terrible experience at Dish, I went to UNCC for class then was really hungry! A friend of mine in class was like \"you should try this place it is really good.\" So I did. And it was! I drove over from campus and was immediately seated even though lunch was in full swing. I looked at the menu, saw the daily specials and decided on the Famous Beef Tips over rice with mashed potatoes and fried okra. I also saw they had a big dessert case and tried the peanut butter chocolate cake with really good dark chocolate icing on top. The potatoes were not fresh but tasted really well with the beef gravy on top, and the fried okra was frozen but was not greasy so that was a plus. The beef tips were pretty good though, and the rice was cooked well, and the peppers and onions were awesome! The cake itself was just okay but the peanut utter icing was the bomb. As was that fancy chocolate icing on top of the peanut butter icing. The waitress answered my questions very well and was knowledgeable about just about everything. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My family used to go here all the time. We always noticed the staff wasn't too friendly, but we liked them so much, we ignored it. One day we placed a pretty decent sized pickup order. We noticed that about 80% of it was wrong. We didn't make a big deal, just went back and wanted then to make it the way we ordered it.. They refused. They wouldn't correct our order. They were beyond disrespectful and when we just said we are going to return it (since they refused to correct it) they yelled at us. We finally had to threaten to leave the food their and dispute the charges. They finally gave in and refunded us. 

If they would have just corrected it when we brought it to their attention, they would still have  the 8 of us as regulars. 
Just some advise to the staff, a good attitude will go a long way...."}
{"text":"Recently went back while in the area to Harrisburg family.???  This used to be the best place in Harrisburg to get a good meal. Service was terrible, the California omellete was nothing but a bunch of canned mushrooms thrown on a plate with some eggs over it. Horrible! Really sad to see a good local place give up and not care about the quality of service or food. Won't be back"}
{"text":"3 stikes and you are out.  First time out, was okay nothing to grand but wasn't bad. Second time I got the roast beef dinner and it was like eating shoe leather smothered in brown gravy.  Third time.... well we did breakfast.  Wasn't horrible.  Eggs were a bit under cooked for scrabbled.  My husbands omelet has only about half cooked.  The worst was when  I found a LONG reddish brown hair in my grits.  Needless to say GROSS and won't come back."}
{"text":"Just passing thru town when we happened upon this great find! All 4 of our group ordered different meals: beef tips, shrimp scampi, spaghetti, veggie plate, yet everyone raved about their selection. We were seated quickly even though it is a busy Saturday night. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this on behalf of my Mom, Teena.

I have been a regular at Harrisburg Family House for years.  However, my experience last week will make it my last.  I ordered the Baked Chicken with 2 sides.  The side items were fine.  But the Baked Chicken was undercooked.  It was pink on the inside.  I ate a couple bites, and it was obviously not \"setting well\" with me.  I am not one to complain, so I just paid the bill and left.  Upon getting home, I became very sick (stomach-wise), and upon the advice of my son, I called Nick (the owner) to give feedback.  

(My son told me \"if they don't know it, they can't fix it)

My conversation with Nick was highly insulting as a patron.  He insisted my stomach issues were not from the chicken as he has NEVER under-cooked chicken.  He made no effort to \"make it right.\"  I politely thanked him for his time and hung up the phone.

There are too many other restaurants in the Harrisburg/Concord area for Nick's casual approach to not have adverse effects on his business.  I hope Nick reads this and will re-consider his approach to other less than desirable experiences had by other patrons in the future.

{"text":"Good food and good price. The flounder is perfectly battered and fried and if served with their squash, is a perfect combination. The atmosphere is generally for families or older couples."}
{"text":"Very good southern food and surprisingly affordable. Waitress was super nice and attentive. I would come by again. Subtracting one star only for the long line waiting for a table and paying - hey but people keeping flooding in means something!"}
{"text":"Great good old family style restaurant a fare.  The regular \"meat and 3\"  Always packed, but usually not a long wait during busy times.  Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Good desert selection. These folks used to own the Athens restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went there today, for lunch. Was sorely disappointed. I got the lasagna, tasted like it was frozen, salad had freezerburn lettuce in it.

Never again."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often as the food is always good and the service is usually pretty stellar too. They have daily lunch and dinner specials where you get to choose two sides with it. You get a ton of food and the price is reasonable for just about everything. They also have a good breakfast selection. This is pretty much a diner style type place so if you enjoy food at places like that then you will love it here. It can be crowded on weekends and sometimes there is a wait. Definitely recommend this place all around."}
{"text":"Every Saturday after 4pm when baked potatoes available, I enjoy lemonade and sirloin tips tender with onions and green peppers over rice with gravy, baked potato, sliced tomatoes and one roll and one cornbread.  And always get large free lemonade to go."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Harrisburg Family House Restaurant, a family owned restaurant serving healthy home cooked favorites in Harrisburg, NC. This diner-meets-restaurant, offers a wide variety of choices including salads, steaks, BBQ, and seafood just to name a few, and I didn't mention a full range of breakfast treats.

Dora here. Or desserts!! How could you leave off this goodie case, Ernie? lol. Parked right by the waiting area. Yeah, try walking by this without drooling. Those chocolate bears behind that red cake called my name.

Actually, we were headed to another restaurant in the area, but that was a bust because they were closed. With the help of our foodie apps like Yelp and Zomato we found this gem a short ride away. And when we walked in and spotted the fire truck photo, BONUS! Has to be good, right? lol

I chose the Boneless Pork Chops with turnip greens and a garden salad. This plate came with two large lean pork chops, oozing juice and with an amazing grilled flavor. The turnip greens were good and served with pepper sauce and the salad was a great start to the meal.

Dora here. Normally the Steak Tips dish is laden with onions, rice and gravy, but since hubby and I are trying to eat a little less carb heavy lately, I opted for just the steak and peppers, which were tender and well seasoned. If the green beans weren't fresh, they were a fantastic replica, not mushy but not al dente, either. Overall, a happy dance in my mouth.

Considering the crowd, our food came out lightning quick. Great value and flavors, healthy options, and giant portions. If not for the close proximity of tables, the loud chatter, and the curtness of the server, we might have stretched our rating to five. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"It was good \"diner\" style breakfast. Tons of varieties of things from all kinds of omelets,  to waffles, pancakes,  french toast,  etc. Servers were nice, prompt and pleasant. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the coffee was absolutely awful. Other than that, there is really nothing negative to say about the place. Cost was good too. Breakfast for 8 was only $65 and we ate like Champs. I'd go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"The Red, White, and Blue Waffles are AMAZING!!!  Loaded with fresh fruit!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek-style restaurant with your typically huge menu. Everything that I have had has been decent. From breakfast to pork chops, it's a good local place where everyone can get what they want. Most items are made in house so all of their \"regular\" food has some flavor. It  doesn't seem to taste overly processed like many of these places do. 

The chicken parm has to be the best thing that I have had there. It is better than Olive Garden and is only $9. The Marinara sauce is a little paste heavy. Asked the waitress what was the best thing on the menu, and even inquired about a review on the wall, but unfortunately she did the thing I detest, and just read the menu to me. 

We also tried, this time, the chicken pot pie. It had good flavor, even the gelatinous goo holding it together tasted like chicken. Unfortunately, they covered the pastry (the pie part, no crust) with sauce, so became soggy. 

Everyone in there is always really nice and the service is good. My sister and I eat together all of the time and people assume that we are a couple. The lady at the register had us pegged as siblings in no time, she's the first!

{"text":"We came here for breakfast the other day and i loved it. I couldn't stop looking at the cake up front from the moment we walked in to the moment we sat down. The service was okay but the food made up for it. I had the western omelette with hash browns and it was awesome! Can't wait to try the other breakfast items and the cake up front!"}
{"text":"If Harrisburg has a gem then this it it. Always busy, if not flat out packed....for a reason. Really good food, huge portions, and great prices. Owned by the same family who owned the now defunct Athens restaurant in Charlotte. Really that was not one of my favorite places to eat, but this place is. Very laid back, family friendly....just like Harrisburg. The staff is great and make you feel right at home. Been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner many times....every time a winner. During peak times you can expect to wait for a seat, but it is worth it. Bottom line....if you are in the area do yourself a favor and stop in and enjoy."}
{"text":"The service was fast. The spaghetti and lasagna leave a LOT To be desired. I'll go back and try something else, but I'm not sure I'd suggest the restaurant to anyone else just yet."}
{"text":"Putrid, absolutely sucked! The Italian items are awful! The fish was super greasy, and the country style steak was very tough. We spent way too much money for the crappy dinner we were served. The veggies were out of a can and heated to serve....  Fa-Get It, we'll eat elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Harrisburg Family House is reopen! The fire they had earlier in the year shut down this Harrisburg favorite, but it's open and as busy as ever. There was a few minutes wait at lunch in this Wednesday,  but table turnover was happening quickly. 

I had the chicken pita sandwich, which is one of my favs for sure and it was overflowing with big pieces of chicken, purple onion, lettuce and tzatziki sauce served with fries. I am not sure if the sauce is made in house, but it's delicious even if not.

Hubby chose the chicken tips lunch special and enjoyed it  we opted not to choose from the dessert case today, but it sure was tempting!  Next time for sure!

Our waitress was attentive and friendly even during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times.  The service is always terrible.  Breakfast is terrible, lunch and dinner are ok.    In particular we went for breakfast on July 4th morning before the town parade.  It was busy like it normally is when we go however this morning was the worst experience we have ever had.  The hostess was a complete jerk, very unfriendly.  The waitress was ok however it took forever to get anything from her, drinks, food, refills, etc.  The cashier was terrible.  We had 4 meals that we were paying for and she just punched in a ton of number and gave us a total that seemed much highter than what we should have been paying.  After questioning what we were being charged for she developed even more of an attitude and ran down a list on menu in about 10 seconds.  I am still almost certain we were over charged but she didn't want to take the time to explain it and it was busy so i just let it go.  If they don't like working when it's busy then maybe they should just close the place....I will not be visiting this place again.  Terrible service, below average food and they over charge you."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's your classic Greek family style diner with Southern flare.  They have an extensive menu that everyone can find something to eat.  I've sampled the chicken pot pie, Calabash Shrimp, Crispy Chicken Salad and Stuffed Shells.  They were all very delicious and filling. The food isn't gourmet or really outstanding but it's good and sometimes that's just what you need. 
  The service is great and for some reason we always get out of there under 15 bucks with a tip.  You can't beat that."}
{"text":"I would be in serious trouble if I lived in Charlotte.  This place is fantastic and good for another 20 lbs on a local yokel.  I had the marinated steak for dinner and a standard breakfast for, well, breakfast.  Everything was excellent.  There are not many restaurants where you must stand in line to get out, but you do here."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Front desk counter woman was a real jerk.  Didn't greet with a smile, ask how I was, ask how my meal was or say thank you for my business. 

I would never go back here again."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Harrisburg. Food's quick taste like a home cook meal. Never seen it empty"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great if you get the right waitresses.  Background music a little loud making conversation hard at times. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Food and desserts were amazing. I had the shrimp, my friend had chicken pot pie and my husband have beef tips and rice.  Everything was great. Family style kind of food.  The big downer was how rude the wait staff was. No one as friendly in fact they all looked mad to be there. When my husband went to pay he told the person twice our desserts weren't on the ticket. She got an attitude and said that the ticket was correct.  So thanks for the free cheesecake because you couldn't be bothered to listen. But it doesn't make up for the attitude problem. Also the bathrooms are Ina horrible location. Right beside kitchen exit door in a small space. With a potty training toddler this was no fun to dodge trays on the way. Please have some customer service classes."}
{"text":"Harrisburg Family house is awesome.  Great place to get some good food in Harrisburg.  This place is very simple, by no means culinary excellence, but they do have a very broad array of menu items- and the ones that I've tried have been very good.  

Super affordable prices, specials everyday of the week.  Service is always very good.  The place does have a strange smell sometimes which I've not quite been able to identify, and is very small in size.  I would imagine that there is a wait during peak times.  The parking lot is completely full every morning during the weekday when I drive-by."}
{"text":"Always busy. Great food, great menu full of choices for everyone. Watch out for the dessert case at the front door with all the amazing desserts. Gets us everytime. If they have a Mouse (Chocolate covered cheesecake) - GET IT!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant for many years and always had really good service. However. . .not lately. the last few times we ate here, the waitress seemed to forget us, lose our order or forget to bring our order to us. The prices went up about 20% after the fire, too. This is too bad and I hate to have to write a negative review, but when I sit and wait 20 minutes while others are being served, eat their meal and leave, I think that is unacceptable. Maybe they manage will correct this, but I am taking a leave of absence from this place for a while. There are too many other restaurants in this area where I can sit down and be served the right way."}
{"text":"I always pass this place going through Harrisburg and decided to give it a shot. My sister was visiting from Pinehurst and we decided to try a new spot for breakfast. When we pulled up, the parking lot was packed. We figured this was a good sign. There was a wait since it was around 9:30 on a Sunday morning. We waited on a comfy bench, however the wait wasn't long at all. We were seated in under 10 minutes. The food was excellent. There are only two complaints I have. One would be that the grits I ordered were not in a separate bowl and mixed with my scrambled eggs. In the scheme of things, not a big deal. The second complaint would be the friendliness of our waitress. She wasn't exactly rude, however, she wasn't very friendly either and acted as if she was in a hurry or had something better to do, which is why I'm only giving this place only four stars. However, like I said earlier to food is wonderful and leaves you feeling completely satisfied, and the prices are very reasonable. You definitely get your money's worth here. I will definitely be coming back and highly recommend this place for breakfast. It's now a new favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Harrisburg Family House is a wonderful diner to visit that truly gives you the feeling of southern hospitality. This place has a true small town charm and it is extremely popular around lunch time. Their menu is extensive, from fried seafood favorites such as catfish to unique salads, this place truly has it all. I have only had the chance to swing by here during lunch however I can't wait to try their breakfast some day! Their baby kale salad is a must have if you are looking for a healthy but filling lunch option. I was starving prior to eating it but since it was loaded with grilled chicken, walnuts and cranberries it completely satisfied my taste and appetite. Next time you head through Harrisburg stop here and enjoy the food and hospitality."}
{"text":"HFH is your basic small town, southern restaurant firing on all cylinders: not your hole in the wall diner or dive.  Classic.  Everytime I drive by the parking lot is full and the restaurant brimming with folk.  And that is part of the charm.  Hearty meals for everyday people who enjoy food cooked the way Mom used to do, or something close enough.

My one recommendation is that they serve breakfast all day.  For now it ends at 11 AM, M-F.  Bummer.  Specials rotate daily and you'll be called \"sweety\" or \"honey\" by your waitress.  Normally, I dislike that , , , but here, well, it's somewhat expected.  No harm.  Warm my coffee, please, doll!"}
{"text":"My out of state family and I love this place! We come here for breakfast all the time and have always been pleased with their meals. The staff are very friendly and always prompt with our requests! Serving size of meals is very generous!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loves this place! Awesome prices...service was amazing, and the menu..so many things to decide on, breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  There was I believe 4-5 different kinds of fish on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was not appetizing at all!! And our server wasnt all that great either. Definitely wont be coming back."}
{"text":"I am never scared to try a Greek Meat and Three (as Bill B. put it). There are always a few dishes that you can rely on. Well, there have been a few times that I have stepped outside of the box and tried a few dishes that I usually wouldn't try when strapped for cash (when I usually eat here), and I have rarely been disappointed.

I never would have ordered steak tips for fear that they would have been dry. Well, they were a little dry, but still good. The pork chops, on the other hand, are beautifully cooked. My friend almost lost a finger when he tried to take his fork back from me. The fried squash and grits are great choices as side dishes. The waffles are evenly cooked, but I found the pancakes a  bit greasy. This is the case for most of the menu. You will never be mad that you spent your money on a certain dish, but there are definitely those dishes that made you wish you had a magically refillable plate. 

I recommended Harrisburg Family House to a couple passing through town last summer and I would recommend it to anyone else. It won't knock your socks off, but it's a good, safe bet."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get lunch at with my family, I definitely recommend this place to all ! I couldn't believe how cheap and how great the food is here. 10/10 ! The restaurant looks clean and the waiters are very very nice here. Definitely a family friendly restaurant. The food takes about 20-30min normally."}
{"text":"15 - 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning. Great food! Only a couple of issues, it was almost a 30 min wait for the food and there is not an adequate children's menu. (Only one option)"}
{"text":"Our son is a huge fan of the rice, gravy and beef tips. It's good older fashioned food and service. Only compliant is the waiting area. It is a mess getting in and out, paying, etc., especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Only one word cab describe this place; Amazing. The is the model of what a family style restaurant should be. When you walk in you'll notice that the resturant is always packed full of people but the wait is never long at all especially for groups of 3 or 4. 

There are a list of specials every day that are always great to choose from. Even the place is extremely busy the service is incredibly fast and the waitresses seem to be attentive. Come hungry because food portions are generally huge on most entrees I always leave with a to go box. The desserts are better than any family restaurant I've seen. The Baklava cheese cake and red velvet cheese cake are my favorite. 

If you need good food and not a lot of hoopla try this place very rarely is anyone I've ever brought here disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. Gets crowded so go early. I have tried allot of the menu items and all are excellent."}
{"text":"Have loved this place for years! It serves up tasty Greek, Italian and southern comfort food and does it all well. I have a hard time not ordering the chicken parm every time. The serving size is huge, sauce is delicious and chicken is tender. It's absolutely laden with cheese and for $10.95 comes with a side salad, spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic toast. If you don't go for that there are a dozen or more alternatives.

The comfort food choices change daily and include such southern staples as meatloaf, fried chicken and pot roast. Favorite sides included fried squash, which is lightly battered and not greasy, collard greens and mashed potatoes.

Service is fast and friendly the restaurant is always clean. Like most Greek places it is well-managed. Desserts are showcased as you enter but are better elsewhere and are extremely overpriced.

Breakfast is excellent and is served all day. 

Overall this place is a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"Out doing some shopping for the grandsons in preparations for next weekends trip to Marietta, GA. 

Been to the Harrisburg Family House several time but the last time we tried to go, they were closed for repairs following a fire.

Open again and like before, it was crowded for both breakfast and lunch traffic. That said, they manage things well and we were seated in just a couple of minutes.

Excellent menu with a combination of Southern, Italian and some Greek cusines.

I order the two boneless Pork Chops with Okra and Potato Salad.  The two Pork Chops were nice and thick and very juicy and great taste. Okra was nice and hot. As for the Potato Salad, it was good but not great. Little contract in texture.

My wife ordered the Meatloaf with a Sides of Okra and Buttered Corn (not on the cob).  She loves Meatloaf and according to her, this was delicious.

Service is very good and efficient. This restaurant is very well managed and you can tell from the crowd, a local favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant several times - the service is always good.  Food quality is very consistent.  
I was disappointed the last time I went with how rude the hostess was.  She told me flat out she was mad because the other hostess left her to seat people.  Not one to hold back when being treated poorly I asked if she was upset with me - it took her back and she did \"try\" to apologize.  
Our waitress was fantastic and the food was good!"}
{"text":"I love a \"meat and two veg\" diner - and this place fits the bill.   I had one of the lunch specials - two fried pork chops, mashed potatoes, fried squash and corn bread.  All were served hot and tasted good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live nearby and tried this place one night in 2012 shortly after moving to Charlotte. We loved it then and have been almost weekly regulars over 3 years later. It never disappoints. We have also since shared it with friends and family from out of town and they liked it as well. For a good home-cooking southern style meal THIS is the closest thing I've found in/near Charlotte.

My only criticism is that they need to get a better way to pay. The cash register line is ALWAYS backed up and way too long. They are under-going some renovations on the outside of the building currently so maybe they will fix that too."}
{"text":"Never again. Waitress...slow. Beef...off. Potato...rotten. Apology...non existent. Took dessert home...it was dry. No thank you."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a cozy breakfast date with friends. The hashbrowns and sausage are amazing and the service is friendly. Fair prices as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am very happy with HFH.  We eat there regularly when we need a quick bite on the way to or from somewhere.  Consistent quality and friendly service.  I won't say it's going to be the best food you've ever had, but it'll be as expected from a family owned restaurant with a large customer base.  I have had problems with take-out.  Make sure you check your order before leaving!"}
{"text":"Hometown favorite for sure. Overall, the food is consistent and comforting, the atmosphere and decor are simple and accessible, and the service is decent. Its just a great place to eat some simple, homestyle food. 

The place gets BUSY during lunch as a heads up."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance!  We hardly have any restaurants in Harrisburg- so I was happy to put this in our rotation after the remodel after the fire.

As you will see in an old post- I was very pleased with the update of the interior!  And I felt like in a whole that the whole restaurant was much cleaner- which was my worry in my first review.

I am basing this update on a specific experience- but I had been there a few time before this happened.  I visited with my husband and son- and ordered a Reuben.  He had the beef tips and was pleased.  I ate half of my Reuben- and then started eating the other side.  I felt a hair in my mouth- (barf-ewwwwww just reflecting on this!) and pulled out a dark hair out of my mouth.  (For the record I am blonde and my husband is bald haha!). I was sooooooo grossed out and that will be my last visit.  I know this can happen anywhere but on a place I was already scared of- this finished my interest on this place.

Not trying to down the place because I support local- and the parking lot is always packed so this won't matter much- but ewwwww."}
{"text":"Yep, they reopened. And people who settle for anything just pack the place. Veggies dumped from a can and heated, meat items dumped from a Sysco bag and heated, and people with no pride in quality eat it up. Go for it, I'll pass."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of things that get this South Charlotte gal to North Charlotte but this establishment is something special. There is always a wait on the weekends but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. The service is very efficient and I love how they give you your ticket when they bring your food. Everything I've ordered here, whether breakfast or lunch, has been phenomenal. If you are in the area and need awesome and incredibly cheap diner food, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with this place. I took my grandmother on a Sunday morning for breakfast which of course was extremely busy, but not at all the issue as this was expected. The food is definitely only mediocre. They served my grandmother a gigantic slab of Ham which was very salty and I think I scratched up the plate trying to cut up for her because it was so tough. I had an omelette (Which was also very salty) , served with grits. they  put my grits and omelette on the same plate so that the grits overtook the omelette. we asked for wheat toast, however, the basket contained seemingly a variety of breads and they were all rock hard as if they had been recycled. 

All the staff seemed aloof, especially the waitress who we had to tell, as she took our orders, to get her tip from the previous patrons off our table. After bringing the food she disappeared. A little while later a woman who barely spoke English  walked up and asked if she could take our plates. At this time my grandmother had a plate (and mouth) full of food plus the fork in her hand. I responded \"she is still eating but you can take mine\". The woman just walked off and didn't take my plate. The waitress retuned shortly before we left and simply said \"have a good day ladies, you can put the tip on your card\". 

Maybe it was residual effects from full moon from the previous night or perhaps just an off day, but I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"First, Server was in the weeds so bad that it was absolutely evident. Still, she was quick as she could be. 

Ordered the California omelette and it was basically scrambled eggs with chunks of avocado just tossed in there. Not well cooked and missing the bacon that's a staple of California omelettes. 

Hash browns tasted frozen and not fresh. Blech. 

Coffee was also kinda burnt. 

Wish I had a good review. They were super nice but the food leaves little to be desired. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here.  The food is always great, the service is on point, and the prices are good too.  Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this family styled restaurant.  The quality of food is great!  The spinach salad topped with Salmon is fabulous and the price is reasonable.  You could easily make this hearty salad into two meals.  FYI- the dressing is Devine!
It is a noisy, bustle family restaurant so be ready. But everyone can find something homemade and yummy!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how these people like this food. The best I can say is most times you can eat the food. I was there when it first opened and the food was close to inedible and the service was poor. A  fly landed on a pasta dish then on the salt shaker and was stuck there. The waitress took the salt shaker when we pointed it out and then she returned the SAME salt shaker stating she had wiped it off. I said I would never return. 
   I have been back 2 times and the food has not improved as far as I could tell but the waitress was very nice and did apologize for the policy of no substitutions, do not go here if you do low carb,  Hell, do not eat here even if you don't.
    My husband does eat here and sometimes takes (forces) one of the kids with him, he likes the food, but he will eat most anything.
  If you like good food for your money look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good prices for the amount of food they give you. It's always packed here anyday or time you go, so don't be surprised if there is a wait. The chicken tips are always a favorite amongst myself, family, and friends - and you can't go wrong with fried okra!"}
{"text":"Harrisburg Family House Restaurant has the best homecooking of anybody!  First of all the breakfast menu is to die for.  There are so many selections that it is hard to decide, but rest assure you will be happy when you get it. Lunch and Dinner are fantastic as well.  The best fried squash and okra.  The country style steak is so tender you can cut it with your forK!  I have never ordered anything that was not delicious!!  If you leave hungry there is something wrong with you and not the food.  Also,  the prices are very reasonable and the service is great!   I always leave with a carryout box.  
Please try it you will love it like my husband and I do.

{"text":"Great food and at low prices with large portions!  I enjoy eating here when I don't feel like cooking or getting dressed up to go somewhere.  Not sure that I've ever gotten an Italian dish here... I enjoy the bbq and seafood dishes!  Will continue to eat here in the future!"}
{"text":"Harrisburg Family is always a solid option for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You really can't go wrong when it comes to this family owned and operated establishment. It is a gem to the locals who have been here a time or two. It is obvious the owner, Nick, cares about his customers and works hard to keep them coming back. 

With an incredibly friendly family atmosphere you can expect great service upon arrival. There is always a smiling hostess waiting to greet you. With dozens of homestyle meals to choose from as well as classic Greek dishes, there really is no bad choice here. I really enjoy the salads, but be sure to choose the small-trust me it is plenty. The large is enough to feed two.  

P.s: Don't take a look inside the dessert glass if you're dieting or counting calories!"}
{"text":"If you like Beef Steak, as much as I do, then you'll have to try their Athen's Famous Beef Strips. As a Daily Special, they cost slightly north of $10 and you'll receive four strips. However, with paying north of $13, you'll receive six strips. Nonetheless, either way, 'your choice', it's one of the least expensive steak specials around and boy is it good and flavorful; as well as surprisingly tender.
Their Breakfast is also great. You'll have to try their Steak & Eggs. 
To be completely honest, their entire menu is extremely good and their price-point is extremely appealing."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre prices were decent. The main reason for one star is service is not very good. Waited a while for order to be taken while waitress talked in corner. Numerous times drinks were empty for a considerable amount of time and had to ask another waitress for refills. Was not impressed at all and will not come back."}
{"text":"We'll I'm here, there was a long line to be seated but we didn't have to wait long.  The staff are quick and fast not much time to talk to you but that's okay. I had the breakfast (omlett, grits, saugage) and it was good. Only problem, the place is to small for this busy place.  I hope they look into expanding.  I will return."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here 3-4 times since they've opened up. I read through the reviews before deciding to finally write my own. Yes it is owned by a Greek family. Yes they mix Greek and southern cuisines, but the food is just not good. It is cheap though, and it is greasy, and that HAS to be the reason why the restaurant is almost always packed in this down economy. I think over the years I've had the cheeseburger, dry with little to no flavor which belies the greasy footprint it left on my plate. The beef tips were served with rice that was cooked to mush and the tips themselves were over seasoned (Greek seasoning to boot) and over cooked.  The Philly cheese steak sandwich was not much better. The only reason we have been here so many times is because of out of town visitors wanting to try the place and family members wanting to meet here. If you want a more accurate description of what the review SHOULD be for this place, scroll to the bottom of the page and enter the filtered review section, there is a bit more honesty there in my opinion."}
{"text":"The place was busting at the seams, even the car park was full. Pretty busy on weekends with a huge menu selection ranging from subs to greek and italian. The chicken wings were just ordinary but the chicken soup with rice was perfect! Don't miss the Famous Athens Marinated Beef Tips, they're really wonderful! The country style steak was different topped with homemade gravy. The restaurant is neat and very nice. And the price is cheap! Where can you get that? Good food that's light on the pocket! Recommended! Highly!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. This restaurant is what family food restaurants should be. It's unfortunate that a fire has it closed down temporarily."}
{"text":"Visit here as often as I can and never been disappointed. One of my personal favorites is the Turkey and stuffing (think they only have it in certain nights). Gets pretty busy, especially on weekends and Sunday lunch. Good home cooking, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is terrific, dinner is OK. Prices are reasonable and service is good. One of the better places in Harrisburg."}
{"text":"Decided to have brunch here on a recommendation from a good friend. There were four of us seated. All four orders got messed up one way or another. Service was slow and no manager in site to check up on customers, which would have solved the problem. Very disappointed and we will most likely will never return. Also, there seemed to be a lack of staff which could have had a major impact."}
{"text":"So thankful to find a GOOD place open on Sunday. Busy and full parking lot but table readily available. Erica very friendly and attentive. Food delivery a little slow but expected for this crowd. The chef's special and the Arizona omelette were our choices and both were good."}
{"text":"We took our family of 7 here and were very dissatisfied with the food and service. We ordered omelets, pancakes, burgers, beef tips, club and Philly cheesesteak. We all left our plates half full. We ordered fried pickles for appetizer and the plates they brought for them were dirty. The waitress seemed uninterested in serving and we had to ask for refills. As someone else delivered our food she came over to ask if we wanted refills, hmmm why would she ask this since we hadn't even begun to eat, and not once did she ask if everything looked ok or if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Attention families with children: do not go here, they will turn you away. Upon arrival, my mom went in to see if they could accommodate a double stroller and was told that wouldn't be a problem and the wait would be 20-25 minutes. My mom spoke to the 2 hostesses and clearly  explained the size of their stroller three times with her hands, since we have twin boys and their stroller is larger.  Our babies are too little for a high chair, so always stay in their car seat in the stroller that pushes up to tables. We have eaten at a number of fine restaurants, and all have accommodated us, never have we had an issue. We've eaten at Ruth Chris with them, to small diners like this restaurant, never a problem. Until today. After waiting 20 minutes in the waiting room, the manager told the hostess that we were not allowed to bring the stroller in. He did this through a windowed door in the back of the restaurant. Never once coming to talk with us. I saw 2 tables that would perfectly fit the stroller and was told no. One was for a larger party and he refused for us to sit there and at another table that would've worked perfectly that was a smaller table. A number of customers were appalled at how we were treated, refused service, after taking all the right steps to enjoy a nice lunch after going to a nearby pumpkin patch. One lovely lady in a wheelchair said, \"This is not right. What they're doing to you isn't right!\" Another couple said, \"I just can't believe this! I'm so sorry for you guys.\" It is a lot of work bringing a baby out, let alone 2 babies. We were discriminated against at Harrisburg 'FAMILY' House for bringing our family to their restaurant and refused service. The older manager should be fired, and the staff should be better trained to talk to customers. My mother and I were embarrassed, angry, and in complete disbelief. And my babies were hungry, as we were going to give them their bottle while we waited. The inadequate communication and level of discrimination was abhorrent and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Not sure if they were having a bad day or if this is the new norm....breakfast was NOT good!  Way salty bacon, hash browns tasted stale and the biscuit was hard.  Not what i have experienced here in previous visits."}
{"text":"Perhaps not the best choice on a weekend morning - this place was packed! Luckily the wait was not long - just a few minutes and we had one of the booths to watch the insanity unfold around us. Much better than an IHOP or somewhere else that will have you standing for what seems like hours.

Once seated, the staff was friendly and we were served quickly too - though there is really nothing terribly surprising here, the food is good and everything makes the place certainly worth a visit (though if you are not a fan of crowds, you may not want to watch when you come!)."}
{"text":"Probably will not be going back there again. The food is good but I don't understand how they forget something on my order every time I eat there and it's frustrating having to always ask for something that I'm not getting every time."}
{"text":"Always a wait, no matter what the wait is they will tell you its 15 minutes, great pricing, GREAT  mac n cheese, but dont go there for good service... always a waitress with no manners and little to no urgency with what you need including drinks. . Owners (or managers, not sure) are always at register and are soooo unfriendly! same lady at register everytime and she is so unfriendly and rude!! But the cheap prices make it worth it occasionally. Waiting for a new diner type restaurant to open so we can go somewhtere else!! We have had good and bad experiences here but im over it, need somewhere new to frequent! !"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. This restaurant is consistently poor in quality for food, service, and cleanliness.  We used to visit the restaurant because we lived in the area and luckily we won't ever need to go back.  The food is classic diner - heavy on the salt and grease. That's what some folks like - I get it.   But the grease could at least arrive hot like it should.  At our last visit, we advised the lady at the front desk (frequently rushed and can't be bothered to give a smile) about dirt on their wall.  When we went back months later, the dirt and grime was still there.  Service is often shaky..don't be surprised if you must ask 4 times for napkins or new silverware.  Lady at front desk will argue with you if your ticket is incorrect. Harrisburg deserves better than this - when some decent restaurants appear they may have a tough time.  Wish I could give a better review but sorry, H'burg Fam.  The truth hurts."}
{"text":"A Harrisburg icon by far! This restaurant was been around for years and yet draws a large crowd nearly everyday. The staff is always super friendly and attentive to whatever you need. The whole atmosphere really gives off that friendly southern charm vibe that I love so much about being back to my hometown to visit family. 

This place does get very busy on weekends of be prepared to wait for a table. Your wait will be well rewarded with a diverse menu of awesome options. I really enjoy their salads here and they are all full of fresh ingredients with your choice of dressing. They also have many different sandwiches, seafood, and even steaks! I haven't been here around breakfast time but I hear they have good options as well. Come here for the excellent service and diner style food!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those reliable, dependable, \"meat and three\" Greek-run family restaurants you can find all over the greater Charlotte area. It's only a few miles from my house, so we get over there a few times a year. 

If you like Italian dishes, seafood, fish, Greek dishes, salads, and sandwiches, served in a family atmosphere by folks who deliver correctly what you order, give them a try. 

This place is VERY popular on weekends. We got one of the last tables available at 6:20 on a Saturday. Come to think of it, we have never been in this place when it wasn't hopping. It's inexpensive and the food is consistently tasty.

I had a salmon steak, green beans, beets. The meal came with cornbread, garlic bread, rolls, hushpuppies, and some minor salad greenery. 

My wife had a beef tips dinner that looked wonderful. It was enough for two, or in her case, tomorrow's lunch. It came with greens and squash.

One of my twins had a stuffed pasta shell dish that was enough food for triplets. The other had spaghetti with meat sauce and meat balls, children's portion, big enough for two kids. My daughter is a vegetarian, so she just ordered veggies... They don't have any great vegetarian choices for protein, other than a Vegetarian Hoagie.

I'd go early if I were you."}
{"text":"Generally, I do not like the \"wait for seating\"arrangment of no-reservation restaurants. Committing to have Sunday breakfast at 11am at this family oriented restaurant was counter-intuitive. Realistically we may have waited 30 minutes, but I had a good time talking to other people waiting, interacting with cute kids, and chatting w my friend so the time went quickly. 
At that time we had a choice to go with lunch, but both of us chose breakfast. 
The coffee left a little to be desired for my tastes. I like rich, medium or dark roast, and this was more old-school that likely plays better to the crowd. 
The menu had lots of great choices. I ordered a California omelette but asked that they make it into a scramble instead. My friend ordered the meat lovers omelette.
My eggs came out great; the avocado and the fresh tomato was just the right ripeness and it was seasoned well, salt-wise. There was an enormous portion of grits, and my rye toast was served dry as I asked. As the scramble was three eggs, the plate was a small mountain of food, and all of it very good. 
My friend liked his eggs also.
Our server was pleasant enough. That she made sure I got the eggs and toast as I asked was appreciated considering how busy she was. My coffee was refilled at just the right times. 
It got loud there a couple times with a semi-trained toddler acting up at the next booth and 2 large family tables near us, but it wasn't unbearable. 
I liked this place, and look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"In the past year or two,  the quality of food has decreased at the Harrisburg Family House. I'm not sure what it is, but as of late I find myself getting just sandwiches and maybe occasional breakfast because it's affordable. I try to get something different everytime I go and either the flavor isn't there, it's too salty, or it tastes like it was frozen.  I still like going here because it's local and the service is good, but I wish they would stay consistent with their food."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I had breakfast there a couple of weeks ago and all the food was undercooked. And the owner looks like a fraud. Do not come here. It's absolutely horrible there."}
{"text":"Do you have a microwave dinner in your freezer? That's basically what you are signing up for at this fine establishment. I'm not sure where the rest of these reviewers buy their drugs, but please feel free to share. You must be intoxicated to believe this place passes for a restaurant."}
{"text":"We will do breakfast here once in a while they have an amazing breakfast steak and their hashbrowns are delicious. The lunches are pretty good too.  The wait staff is always nice even when in a hurry but during a rush they can get overwhelmed and seems like they need more people there at certain times.  The only other thing I would suggest is bringing tip money in cash, if you don't the lady checking you out will ask loudly if you want to leave a tip and how much, maybe just me but I kind of think that is a little crass."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in Saturday morning. I had been scoping this restaurant out for quite a while because I am looking for a good go-to breakfast place that isn't a chain. I ordered the California Omelet without the tomatoes, grits, and biscuit. My wife ordered the Pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon.

My meal tasted great. The avocado, mushrooms, and cheese flowed really well in the omelet. Usually omelets are too dry for me, but these fillers definitely helped the taste. The grits were awesome, especially with a little cheese added. 

My wife did not enjoy her meal as much. Originally, she requested that I find a restaurant for breakfast because she was craving a good pancake. Having chose this place, I assumed that she would love it, I was wrong. She thought the pancake had an off flavor, almost like it came from boxed mix. She said it didn't have that buttery \"griddle\" taste. After having a bite, I could see what she meant. To me it wasn't terrible, but definitely not the best I've ever had either. 

Her bacon was extremely greasy. She could barely take a bite or two from it. However,she really enjoyed her eggs with cheddar. But since her main purpose for visiting today was for a good pancake, this did not help their case. After the meal, she felt very disappointed. 

As for the positives, our server was awesome. She was very personable and attentive. We were given refills consistently and our orders were accurate. Apparently we beat the morning rush (barely) and were able to get seated right away. All in all, I liked this place, but I don't think I'll add it to my rotation."}
{"text":"We eat here every Friday morning. Service is good and food is good. Huge variety to choose from, and I've never had anything bad.  It's like the Greek version of down-home cooking, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

People are friendly and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Since the Harrisburg Family House reopen, We are pleased that it is even better than before. All of the old wait staff is back and they are even better. The interior is completely redone and it is bright and cheery. The food is excellent! Glad Harrisburg had this restaurant back open."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went looking for a local restaurant that had late breakfast and was lucky to find this place. The biscuits and gravy were delicious, corn beef hash was mouthwatering, and the sage sausage hit the spot. The portions were generous and the price was unbelievably cheap. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously good food! My husband ordered the Greek spinach pie which was phyllo dough stuffed with chopped spinach, onion, feta cheese, under a golden brown crispy crust.  It came with a large Greek salad loaded with fresh lettuce, bell peppers, red onion, carrot, tomatoes, olives, and cucumber.  I ordered the chicken soup which tasted like \"Mom made it\" delicious. It had chunks of real chicken, carrots, and rice in a long lovely rich broth.  Absolutely perfect!  Service was excellent and the noise level was tolerable, background music was low enough conversation was possible...and during our conversation we decided we're coming back again!  We drove here from Greenville, SC, two hours away, and won't need an excuse...just a desire for more really good food."}
{"text":"I'm guessing the only reason this place stays packed is because it's really the only restaurant here in Harrisburg and they are fast. I've been here several times, ordered off the breakfast, lunch and dinner menus and have been underwhelmed each and everytime. Infact, the food has been pretty tasteless to me. I don't get what the hype is however, evidently I am in the minority here.  But from now on i'll get my lazy butt in the kitchen and make my own food cause it certainly tastes better than here."}
{"text":"Owned by the original owners of Athens in Charlotte, they kept the success rolling. Great staff and great food. One of my favorite places in Harrisburg."}
{"text":"Love the chicken Parmesan! My second favorite is the chicken tips.  The wait staff is always friendly and prompt.  If you go on Sunday, be prepared for at least a 20 min wait. It is well worth it though. I have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Sometimes we all take people, places and circumstances for granted until, one day, they are not there anymore.  Such was the case with Harrisburg House last July when it burned one night.  We were lost without our regular dinner spot and spent the last 5 months searching for a decent place to eat.  We have always appreciated the good food, fresh wild-caught fish and farmers market vegetables all offered at very reasonable prices.  Suddenly, we were faced with more expensive, smaller-portioned dinners at chain restaurants.

Thankfully, Harrisburg House is open again in an even bigger and better way.  The restaurant has been redesigned inside and out into a bright and cheery dining environment.  Most of the staff has returned and the food is as wonderful as ever.  Owners Niko and Bill demand quality, good service and customer satisfaction.  

We are so very happy to have this restaurant open again!"}
{"text":"Thoughts and prayers for the staff of HFH for speedy repairs after the fire. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy Harrisburg Family Restaurant! The service is always good and the food is hot & fresh. I come for breakfast but I've seen the lunch plates go by to their table destination. I'm in love with the Toast Combo with a side of hash browns."}
{"text":"If you walk in there 5 minutes before closing expect them to make you wait while they stare at you until 9 and then rudely tell you the kitchen is closed! Nothing special about the place. Food just ok.. Will never be going back. Guess they can afford to to turn away paying customers."}
{"text":"This is a great little diner. My favorite is the gyro pita sandwich. The meat tastes great and is cooked well. It is always tender. They also have great French fries.  Other friends that I have gone here with have gotten some of their specials and they always look good. They give you big portions.  You won't leave hungry! 

It always amazes me that this place is just a 5-10 minute drive outside of the Charlotte city limit and how \"country\" it is in comparison. The wait staff never seems to be in any kind of hurry. It may take a while to be greeted after being seated. For me the place always seems a little dirty. The diet coke is flat.  I'd go back for the good diner style food and cheap prices."}
{"text":"I normally let things roll off my back but I left that restaurant so disgusted I had to write a review. When we sat down, Savannah didn't even greet us! She was super loud asking us what we wanted to drink. My little 7yr old nephew innocently asked for more drink and again she was rude saying give me one minute. Another thing and final straw that made me livid was when she finally bright the food out. She gave the wrong plate to my brother in law who along with my sister ordered a vegetable plate. He kindly told Savannah what he ordered with the hope of getting it corrected. She then says everything that you all ordered is here you just have to figure out what goes to who. At that point I had to speak up. I told her I've been trying my best to be patient with you Savannah but you've been rude since we got here. She then begin to talk over me and tried to act as if I wasn't even talking to her. I said I need to see a manager. She had the audacity to say he's right over there. I went to him and explained what was going on and requested a new waitress. Neither he or Savannah apologized but he did send a new totally opposite and awesome waitress named Caroline and he offered my Mom a free dessert since it was her birthday. Yes we (family) took my Mom there to celebrate her birthday, needless to say it wasn't so happy . The food was good but because I received such terrible service from Savannah I'm giving them 2 stars. Maybe Savannah's family owns the restaurant and she felt entitled to act a fool but it was totally unacceptable no matter who you are! I will go back because the food is good and the other staff was nice."}
{"text":"One of my go-tos for whenever. The food is  casual home-cooked style but their variety is crazy! So much to choose from! Their portions are large and I haven't had any main entrées here that I didn't like. One of my faves is the Spaghetti with meat sauce and the country steak over rice.  The only downside are their cakes. I had one. While their portions are huge the cake is tasteless and in something in an attempt to keep the cake moist. They are no good. I thought about trying some of the cheesecake or something else but decided not to. Other than the cakes...I love this place! Breakfasts are awesome as well!!'"}
