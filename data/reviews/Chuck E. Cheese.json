{"text":"This location is terribly ran and managed. You're lucky if you can ever find an employee to help with prizes, checking you in or servicing machines. A good amount of their games do NOT work or they're out of tickets. We played a basketball game and no matter how many shots you made, your score is always 0. If you play skee ball, make sure there are balls because about half of them don't have any. If you try to play the alien invasion game, beware, it doesn't register when you throw a ball into correct spots to get points. If you want to ride the little fire truck, please know it won't work. You'll scan your card and after it takes your money the computer software will wig out and start showing only coding which renders it useless. One of the other alien games states you'll get 5 balls to try to get them into a 1,000 point white bucket but it only has 3 balls and won't give you some of them back to play a total of 5. Their jungle gym with a slide is so disgusting inside you will not slide down. Your butt just sticks the filth of the slide every inch of the way. If you can find a game that works, you'll work hard for maybe 1-2 tickets. But good luck trying to put them into the ticket machine because most of them are jammed and won't work. Also be careful with extracting tickets from games because the one you get is so hard to pull out it tears. When you try to find an employee to claim for prizes, you'll see the cheapest redemption is 10 tickets. And it's basically just a sheet of 4 stickers. For 50 tickets, you can get a box of nerds! Wohoo! They also don't maintain their beverages well. Most of the soda isn't filled regularly so you'll get just carbonated water. When we went, the soda machine was stuck and just pouring soda out for 20 minutes until we finally yelled (literally) towards the kitchen to find an employee. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because honestly pizza taste isn't that bad. (I'm sure I don't want to know how it's prepared because that may change my opinion). Thankfully my kids are young enough to where they can play a game that doesn't work and they don't know the difference. If you want to have a good outing with fun, operable games that give sufficient tickets I highly recommend King Putt off Stephanie in Henderson. May be pricier but trust me it's worth it."}
{"text":"Short of staff. Looks too dirty. Too many machines out of order. some had the sign but some did not, and lost money in those. Yes it is a kids place but that should be one of the many reasons it should be clean."}
{"text":"The food is good but they are ALWAYS under staffed! I come to this location since it's the closest to my house yet I always end up regretting it. It takes forever to get your food and even longer (over 30 minutes ) to cash in tickets:("}
{"text":"The salad and pizza were good however just a lot of games not working. I would say 6 of the games didnt work. I got tired of telling the guy well maybe better luck next time"}
{"text":"Disgusting hate this nasty dirty location. Disgusting bathrooms dirty ass windows smells like ass ghetto as hell. Never enough employees they act like incompetent idiots. No customer service at all. Cashier deals with money card constantly and touches ur cups and plates with her nasty hands. They just need to close this down. !  Ghetto as hoodrats showing there big as belly horrible behaved as kids just dirty !"}
{"text":"Wait time to order 15 minutes understandable. Our pizza was left in the window for over 15 minutes getting cold, finally got tired of waiting went to go get it ourselves. Purchased an all you can eat salad and was never given a clean plate (asked but was ignored, pretty sure SNHD would not approve) when we informed an employee of us getting our own pizza he looked at us shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Wait time to redeem tickets ridiculous to say the least! The restaurant itself was disgusting (please see photos). But my favorite part was the manager on break enjoying a hot meal while ours was not and his staff and restaurant were sinking (what a great leader!). I'll post a resolution if I ever get one, definitely NEVER returning!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party and I was losing my mind with all the kids. I know its a kids place, but I dont want to spend time with someone elses kids. Kids where walking around without parents and they seem lost. I will never go back there unless I really have to."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst place I've ever been. Under staffed, dirty tables, dirty bathrooms, dirty floors and I'm pretty sure their games are not sanitized every day after closing. Their games wasn't functioning properly, i swiped my card 5 times at their train kids ride, never worked . I tried at other games the Chuck E. Cheese bike, never work but I loose 2 credits. Don't waste your time here. Better yet take your kids to kids quest at boulder station casinos. $10/hr unlimited games and they watched your kids. I also went to Chuck E. Cheese's henderson and they are very friendly and clean place. All machines worked properly."}
{"text":"This place was really nice when it first opened up. Now it seems like every other game is always broken. And now that they've bypassed the token system it's a lot harder to get a refund so most people just end up losing their money. If you have wheels to go somewhere else it would probably be your best choice , I'll give it a 3 stars because the food isn't too bad."}
