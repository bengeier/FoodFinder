{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the lamb sandwich with fries. Was shocked by how expensive everything was and so was expecting my meal to be incredibly delicious and worth the money. Sandwich was ok but nothing I would ever crave again. Fries were horrible. Limp and tasted like they'd been frozen and heated. Only bothered to eat a few. So disappointing. Would never recommend this place. So many other options and places to try."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Beautiful place. Pete, the bartender is outstanding and worth going back just for his impeccable service. 
Lobster bites are unbelievably good! 
Shrimp cocktail one of the best I've had. Great drinks!"}
{"text":"We went on a warm winter night and they gave us the option of eating indoors or outdoors.  We had a 7:30 reservation.  We chose inside and were given a cozy booth.  Our waiter was knowledgable and attentive, and not too attentive.  She ordered a French, made perfectly, not too sweet and froth on the top.  I ordered a classic and there were tiny ice chips on top.  Perfect.  
Oysters as our appetizers were chilled and tasty.  She ordered the sea bass.  It was excellent.  I ordered the pork chop medium.  The outside was very good, the inside was cold and absolutely raw.  Not pink.  It was uncooked.  This upset my date and she asked that I take it back.  Sometimes you just want an evening to go without incident and so I didn't make a fuss.  I left half of the pork chop and it was clear that it was uncooked.  The waiter took no notice.  Unfortunate, but the rest of the meal was so good and I definitely was not hungry, we still gave it an 8.5/10.  We ordered carrot cake to go.  It was a sizable portion and still good when we ate it at home.  

For the price, things could gave been better, but with so few fine dining choices close to our home we will give this place another chance to cook their food more thoroughly."}
{"text":"Met some friends from work for cocktails and shared 6-7 plates, all of which were on point, great beer and wine list and service was as good as it gets. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. I got the chicken and waffle. It wasn't my favorite but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand these less than stellar reviews.  I have been twice, so far, and both times were absolutely great!  The fried lobster bites are awesome, so was the house smoked salmon.  My husband thought the filet may be the best steak he has ever had, and he has eaten plenty.  The duck breast special was delicious.  Everything was just perfect, including the temperature of the red wine.  It was the perfect temperature, a little warmer than cellar temp, but not  a too warm 70+ room temp. Dining outdoors was delightful.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great for lunch and dinner.  FYI they also have brunches on Saturday and Sunday and it rocks"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the food and service has been excellent. I've had lunch, brunch, and dinner here and enjoyed each visit.  We recently celebrated a special occasion and our group was somewhat larger than expected, but the management and servers took everything in stride and made our evening perfect."}
{"text":"Been here twice-Once for dinner and once for lunch. Not sure which was more disappointing. Lunch of salad with grilled salmon included microscopic piece of overcooked salmon wilted salad and flavorless dressing. Dinner slightly better but I wouldn't rush to try this place. Also, seems way overpriced for what you get..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last night. We had a fantastic meal. The service was spot on as well. My wife had the crab cakes and I had the prime rib both were excellent. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a plain-jane unimaginative and very forgettable, yet very expensive, restaurant experience look no further. Our group was looking for a special restaurant for a Christmas gathering, but we were frustrated and ended up getting salads at the table. We ate quickly and decided to move on."}
{"text":"If you're of color do not got to this restaurant. I was told there was an hour and a half wait when there was at least 5-6 tables open.  I would give zero if it was an option."}
{"text":"I'll give this stop a solid 4. We really enjoyed our specialty drinks and time socializing at the bar before moving into dinner.  Dinner was delicious starting with the seafood tower, onto a beet salad and we each ordered separate dishes to sample and share; sea bass, filet and the shrimp gnocchi, rounding out the night with the chocolate cake!  The sea bass was the star of the evening.  Our server was great, but there was a little too much time from our drink orders and time to table.  I think that may have just been side effects of a crowded bar with live music no less on PGA tourney week.  All in all a really nice night!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, if they seated me any further away, I would have been in the parking lot. burger was well done, asked for medium. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Four of us went to SouthPark Grill at 6:45 on a Wednesday night. When we walked in, we noticed that the restaurant was not crowded.  The young hostess walked us to a back room, with no windows, and tried to seat us in the last booth in the room. We asked her if we could sit out front where the windows were, and she said all the booths were reserved for parties of six. The funny thing was, the booth we were standing by, while she checked with her manager, had only four women.  Not a good start...
After finally being seated in the front room, we had a very nice male waiter.  He had a great personality and was very informative and courteous. He was training a new waitress, and she was also very courteous and personable. 
Now to the food...I ordered a salad with grilled shrimp. It was ok, but basically all lettuce.  It had very light toppings and only three shrimp.  We ordered oysters Rockefeller which were a highlight. My friend ordered a rare cheeseburger, and it was medium at best.  Also ordered was a French dip sandwich, and it had very little meat and too much bread.  The French onion soup was good as were the grilled scallops.  The wine and service were both good. 
So, with the seating problem, and the so-so food, we will definitely not return.  There are too many restaurants in Charlotte to come back to the SouthPark Grill."}
{"text":"I've been a couple times. Once for lunch and another time for happy hour. At lunch I had crab cakes and an appetizer that I can't remember. The crab cakes were good.  They were priced at $30+ though. Especially at lunch just thought too expensive for crab cakes and fries. Awesome service from the waitstaff though. 

Happy hour ordered an old fashioned and it was essentially a Shirley Temple with a dash of bourbon added for color.  Easily the worst drink I've ever had served to me at a bar that didn't smell like stale beer. Got a bourbon on the rocks after that and called it a night. 

With Village Tavern right across the street serving a broader menu at lower prices with a better bar I'd just go there.  Not sure how this place will differentiate itself and stay in business with those prices."}
{"text":"Update: Decided since it has been awhile we would give SG another try. The service was worse the second time around. Our waiter seemed annoyed that we were there. The timing of food was terrible. They brought apps without plates,  brought out our entrees before salad and when we told them our waiter acted annoyed and said he'd bring them. We didn't want them after getting our entrees. After, the food was bland and uninteresting. Even the manager tried to argue with us about the service and food quality. WHAT? Well, when the check arrived they took of our entrees off the bill so the evening out didn't hurt as bad as it could have. We will pass on SG going forward. 

We went last night for our anniversary and were so disappointed. We started with an appetizer and asked for the oysters rockefeller plain and they came warm. After, our salads were fine BUT the charred ceasar is a kale ceasar that is not charred. Our entrees were the worst...my husband ordered the filet and it was so tiny and bland served with basic fries. It was NOT comparable to any filets that you can get for almost the same price else where. My chicken was ok but served with greasy rice and overcooked broccolini. As for dessert we passed and didn't even get a Happy Anniversary from our waiter. Luckily the night was saved by stopping by DelFrisco's after where they treated us to dessert & an amazing port!"}
{"text":"Friendly & quick service! Good recommendations on wine. Food was good, but nothing noteworthy. I would say its a classic 90s upscale grill- nothing modern about it. Menu is extremely limited."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Best salmon I have ever had!!!   so good.  
The black rice, awesome.  The bok choy was not good. Very stringy. Could not cut it or chew it. I got it stuck in my throat.   
Squeezing 6 people in the booth was a little to close for comfort."}
{"text":"This place is PRIMO! We loved everything about this restaurant. The hubs and I went in for our anniversary and were very happy. The service was on point, the food was great, even the owner can by and spoke with us. He made us feel like we were sitting at his dining room table. Not too invasive, but put such a personal touch on our evening. I defiantly recommend trying this place. 10 out of 5 stars!!!!!!! (Get the lobster bites and hand cut ribeye!!!)"}
{"text":"Great location. Nice outside seating. Nice restroom area. Great bar. Drinks were made perfectly. I had the French dip sandwich it was amazing. The beet salad was plain and lacked flavor. The chocolate cake was good, but nothing to really write home about. Good service. Nice place for an evening out with friends & family. Would be great for date. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Had to downgrade my prior 5-star review after last night's experience. If 3.5 stars were an option, I would have rated it that, but didn't have the heart to do 3 stars due to management being nice and receptive. My main issue last night was our server. Myself, husband and another couple friend went to Southpark Grill and after being seated, it took a bit of time for our server to come over. When he did, we all felt he was rushing us and that we were kind of a bother to him. Not friendly at all. From there, it was just mistake after mistake. While the management and other staff that were helping to bring out food and such were very nice and apologetic, our server was not until the very end when it was time for the checks. Drinks were slow/wrong, salad wasn't brought before entree and then when it finally was, had the wrong dressing, one of the two med-rare filets was very rare, and it was frustrating that our server's attitude was crappy. One line of his was particularly annoying when while my friend was ordering her drink, he said \"Can you hand me that dirty fork?\" and then she had to repeat her drink order because he wasn't listening. French onion soup was still amazing, charcuterie board, oysters, bone-in ribeye and filet were great, but my husband's NY strip was a bit tough. Overall, the service left a bad taste in our mouths. Probably will try again, but likely not anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. I cannot say enough good things. The setting is nice, they have a great patio, the service is always top notch, the management is awesome, and the food is great. They have the best salad I have literally ever had in my life. The Park Salad is phenomenal and that is an understatement. Everything about it rocks. I always get it with the Fried Oysters and they are incredible. The dressing is a honey vinaigrette that  I desperately want the recipe for. They also put goat cheese and pecan brittle in there as well. The pecan brittle will change your life. Not kidding. Try it!"}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars...it would be less if it was not for Marybeth and the valet...

We arrived...
Pulled up, a young man opened the door for my wife... polite as could be...

Walked in...
Told the hostess of or reservation, she proceeded to walk us to the rear of the room...as I told her I would like to sit closer to the windows...she slapped her hand down on the table grabbed the menus and started walking toward the area I requested. When we got there she began to sit us in front of the wait station and again I said I want closer to the windows (it was still light out and we wanted to enjoy the dusk)...she again slapped her hand on the table to grab the menus, sat us where I suggested and walked away in a huff (a note for the management - she is the blonde in need of an attitude adjustment that was working this evening).

The service...
Our server, Marybeth was excellent...knowledge of the wine list and menu, attentive, perfect timing...

The wine list...
Adequate.

The food...
Prime rib...very tough!
NY Strip...tough!
But the potatoes, broccoli and asparagus...perfect.

Our exit...
Again...it is all about the service...the valet was polite, he asked the right questions, he was all about \"the service\"!!!

Our desert to go...
Chocolate cake...best part of the meal!!!

I will give them the benefit of the doubt...they are new...hopefully they will work through the growing pains, hire the right staff and perfect the menu. 

WE WISH THEM THE BEST OF LUCK."}
{"text":"Had a birthday celebration with family and friends at the South Park Grill. It was out first visit and we had a good time...

The cocktails were delicious - the South Park Old Fashioned was essentially a basic old fashioned but with rye and brown sugar... The Basil Smash was bright and not too sweet. Good wine list and a the bar area was lively. The main dining room was pretty loud but fun.

The lobster bites appetizer was disappointing - overcooked to the point if being chewy. The prime rib was really nice, whipped potatoes were cold when brought to the table but tasty. Had a taste of the gnocchi and the filet, both really nice.

Highly recommend sharing the chocolate cake.

Service was prompt and professional but you could definitely tell it was the last service on what had been a busy weekend evening.

I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Now HERE is a restaurant in a HOT part of town that is hitting on ALL cylinders!   From the contemporary atmosphere that makes you feel warm all over, to the service that makes you feel totally taken care of     (i.e. Joe), this restaurant is a happening place!   LOVELY bar area that was not particularly busy on a Tuesday night, but I can envision it bustling on a weekend. The food was simply amazing. I started with the beet salad that had some citrus and cheese in it. That is when the WOW WOW WOW started!  And then I moved on to the Rotisserie chicken.  It came with mashed potatoes and broccolini and was unlike other rotisserie chickens I have had.  The presentation was magnificent.  It was so moist and delicious and I could easily go back and have this over and over.  My friends, Arlene and Sid and John, had pork chops, salmon, and salads and they all raved.   I kept hearing about the brussel sprouts that came with their meals, but I was not offered even a taste.  / Excited that a piano bar is coming here in the next week or two. I can imagine that it will done in a very high class style.  Live piano music will enhance the ambiance even further.  For sure, I will be back to enjoy more of the casual decadence of this restaurant.  Soon!  Hurray for the SouthPark Grill. Two thumps up and then some."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight. They have a parking garage behind the place or you can valet your car. This place was quiet and had a decent sized crowd. We had a reservation and when we entered we were greeted and then seated. The waiter was rude and didn't listen at all.  He was horrible. My sister ordered the crab bisque and when it arrived I commented it looked good so he has the manager being one for me..... that I ended up paying for. I didn't ask for it. Food came out and he never checked on us. He went over specials and had no eye contact and looked disinterested in even working. He seemed disinterested in serving us overall I had to ask manager for a box to pack up food or basic water. The crab bisque was missing something and lacked flavor. The Rossi's were chicken was a big portion but the chicken was bland and the broccoli was over cooked. The mashed potatoes were okay. My sister didn't finish her fish sandwich and thought it lacked flavor. So we didn't order dessert or try the drinks. It wasn't a good experience at all. The location is nice, but food isn't good at all. They have some work to do and I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve at the Southpark Grille was fabulous! It's located behind Piedmont Row, tucked away and was alittle difficult to find. Classy, high end restaurant with a pleasantly tranquil environment. 
I had the Chilean Sea Bass with truffle dusted fingering potatoes. It was a thick, perfectly cooked 6oz. piece with a nicely seared outside and moist on the inside. It came with a couscous side but I changed it out for the potatoes, which were beautifully seasoned. ($40) And my dirty martini was spot on, too!
One friend had the NY strip and it was a big, thick cut cooked perfectly to her requested medium temp. It pared well w.their garlic mashed. She arrived early & had lobster bites and said they were out of this world....and she's a picky foodie.
Another friend had some pasta and shrimp dish, which he loved. I could see the shrimp were a good size, too!
We split their chocolate cake for dessert, which we found to be tasty (chambourd & chocolate) but it was dry. So, I didn't care for the texture.
Even tho we had to ask for bread they were attentive about refilling the basket. I rate service as excellent.
My rating is 5.
In addition to the dining areas there is a very nice sized, beautiful wood carved bar.
I will definately be going back! Can't wait to try their oyster rockerfellers!"}
{"text":"First time, went here with wife. Parking was easy, we were sat kinda of sat in the back which was definitely quieter. Started with the French onion soup, very good. server recommended the Chilean sea bass, now I'm a huge fan of this. There's was bland, it came over a bed of couscous which I wasn't a fan of but that again was bland. Portion size was about half that of say Ruth's Chris but within $4 of RC price. Scale of 1-10, 10 being great, 5-5.5. Chef really needs to experiment with pairings for this because it could have been much better. Wife had the filet. They butterflied it and the weird thing about this was one side was they way she wanted it (well), the other medium rare. We also had the broccolini which was underdone and once again, bland. We will try it again as we would any place because they could have just had a bad night but like this again and they won't be seeing us or the $400 dollars we spent, Stopped by the bar as well, bar scene wasn't bad but they need more than one cognac in the place. Oh, at bar we had the Charcuterie Board which was decent. Need a better selection of cheeses at least have goat cheese or some brie."}
{"text":"I have been to South Park Grill three times.  The first time I sat at the bar and had a Lobster Roll.  I thought twice about ordering a $22 Lobster Roll but figured at a high end restaurant like this it had to be wonderful...Surprise, it was fair.  The Lobster had no flavor, no seasoning and was cold, right out of the refrigerator.  The next time I came in for Sunday Brunch.  My son ordered shrimp and grits which was not tasty.  My son has a big appetite and he would not eat them.  We ordered the jalapeño cheddar biscuits which were nothing special.  I could not even taste the jalapeños or cheddar cheese and they were not  even warm.  The other dish we ordered was avocado toast with shrimp and I really loved it.  In fact the next time I went I ordered it at the bar and it was not nearly as good and I will not pay $20.00 for that dish again.

The bartenders are friendly and efficient.  The Manager is present and attentive but the food is marginal and I will just go for the expensive drinks at the bar from now on.  It's a beautiful place but they need to work on the food."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great ambience, enjoyed sitting outside listening to Frank Sinatra era music. Our server was good. 

The food was unexpectedly poor. We ordered shrimp cocktail and beet salad as starters. The shrimp smelled fishy, the ends looked dirty and the veins were only partially removed. The beets had no flavor and the kale left a bad taste in your mouth.  Entrees were not great. My husband ordered the pork chop medium rare, it was overlooked, dry and flavorless. My prime rib was good but the whipped potatoes were bland. The worst thing we ordered was the chocolate cake.  It's was hard and had very little flavor. We sent it back.  That was our first visit and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Saturday date night-  I had prime rib and wife had the salmon.   Both were delicious.  Her beet salad was awesome--to the extent that she let me taste it!  Service from our waiter Brian was flawless.  This was our first visit, but we will return."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here last night with friends our server Joe gave us excellent service. The oysters Rockefeller was so fresh and welled prepared. I got the chicken entree and the chicken  was well executed by the chef and kitchen staff the chef made me a sauce they didn't have on the menu and I appreciate that kind of service I will be returning back soon. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Ok you can tell that they would like to be awesome. Lots of friendly servers. Went on a Saturday night. Wasn't very busy despite having few reservations available on open table. Good wine options. I had a solid prime rib sandwich. Sides all very good. Good but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"May want to ignore the negative reviews here.  Great food, great atmosphere, good service.  Prime Rib was fanastic, Gnocchi was fanatastic, cocktails were solid. It's a huge space with a great layout...outdoor patio...large bar area.  Classy without being pretentious.  Will return."}
{"text":"Just had a great anniversary dinner there! Julia a very sweet hostess sat us at a great booth. Our waiter Mathew did a very great job making our night special. 
We had the Lobster bites to start, excellent little morsels coated just right.
My wife had the large beet salad for dinner, the beets were pickled just right and the salad had a great balance. I had the thick cut pork chop, chef cooked it perfect to my order, the chop was juicy and flavorful. The reduction had a hint of peppercorn and was great to swab each bite. 
Apple Cobbler to finish a great night.
Thanks to the staff for a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband made a reservation here on Sat night. We arrived about 15 min before our allotted time. The restaurant was beautiful and the decor was amazing. The food was pretty delicious. I had the pork chops, creamy mash potatoes and asparagus. A table of 6 were right next to us and they were loud, drunk and belligerent seemingly. That was pretty annoying because the area we were seated in was pretty small. The waiters were not friendly AT ALL! Almost seemed as if they did not want to be bothered. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"The whole meal from start to finish was impeccable. Our server Matthew was very knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommend the carrot cake! We will be returning."}
{"text":"Been here twice which is 1 time too many. Matt, the waiter is a definite asset to this restaurant.
Food is marginal at best, the facility is aesthetically pleasing. The manager was void of personality & the owner is worse!"}
{"text":"My friend held a brunch here so we were in a private room. The restaurant just walking through was nice and the room we were in was big enough to seat a good 30+ ppl. I ordered the Prime Rib Hash with a fried egg on top which was recommended by our waiter and it was so delicious! I also had a Bellini that was very good, I wanted another but for $11 one would do. The staff was great and checked on us often enough not to interrupt what we were doing but enough to make sure we were always good and didn't need anything. Everyone liked their food for the most part, just the chicken and waffles has a maple chili glaze on it (which it states on the menu) and a couple of the ladies weren't to fond of it so my suggest is just get it in the side if you want to try it. As far as parking, there's a parking garage that is connected that's free."}
{"text":"I took some friends here for dinner and wanted to give this place a try since I am in the area fairly often. We were looking forward to a nice dinner with drinks and conversation with some ambiance. This place fell short, especially on the service. The facilities were pleasant and comfortable, the menu was typical standard fare, the food quality was average, and the service was poor. The server (Scott) did not seem to want our business - unfriendly while we were ordering, didn't bring our drink order - we had to ask someone else to follow up long after our food had been served, and then a while when he finally later he brought out drinks, he forgot one of the four we had ordered nearly a half hour before. After that he never came back to check on so refills. When he finally came by he groaned a single one surly word: Dessert? We had hoped to have a casual dinner with a couple of drinks or wine; but by the end with the unfriendly vibe from the waiter, we were happy to just pay the bill and leave. This place is not on the repeat list for me."}
{"text":"Great place. I had the pork chop special and my girlfriend had a salad with salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The pork chop was awesome!. Very tender with wonderful flavor. Nice size portion. Great South Park location but off the beaten path. Very nice outdoor dining area. The service was great."}
