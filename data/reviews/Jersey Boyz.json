{"text":"Last two veal sandwiches: really good. Tonight's: unrecognizable. No tomato sauce. Veal chopped up in a roll, not a kaiser. Pasta with a trace of tomato sauce. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get a veal or chicken sandwich in the city. The meat is tender and the sauce is the best. After having one you will want to take home another sandwich for later. The servers were very friendly and customer service oriented. Highly recommend Jersey Boyz for your next veal sandwich craving."}
{"text":"I've eaten the veal sandwich from here several times and each time they haven't disappointed. The sandwich is so tasty! The ingredients they use are very fresh and you can tell they're using high quality stuff. All things combined make the best veal sandwich I've ever had. And the sandwich is huge!  Such a great deal for what you pay. They provide good service as well."}
{"text":"So a new restaurant has arrived to the corner of Bloor & Islington, and it's not bad at all. Okay, well, truth be told their printed flyer made me want to poke my eyes out (design 101: balance your font sizes, look for typos, don't use 2 different shades of red right beside each other), but design aesthetics and ridiculous flyer typos aside (Stick & Cheese? Dried Sausage and Bun? Spice Marinate Olive?) lets get down to what you can expect if you actually show up in person.   The restaurant took over the short lived MAS Mediterranean restaurant that was here in 2015. The storefront is bright and well lit, being a corner building with floor to ceiling windows. The room was clean including the seated area of tables and chairs. The menu is basically Italian fare of different forms, including sandwiches, pizza, soup and salads.   I had one of their Veal Sandwiches. Now when it comes to veal sandwiches, there is one to-remain-unnamed American state named sandwich shop across Toronto that sets the standards. And truth be told, this one wasn't quite as good but was pretty close in its enjoyability. The veal was tender and nicely breaded, the bun was large and soft, and then you've got the ability of adding cheese, peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc at about $1 per topping.   Sandwiches are $7.50 before toppings, so an average sandwich will run you about $10-$12 depending on how many toppings you choose, but it is a filling meal that won't require a side dish. Bonus points for the fact that the operators working were really friendly."}
{"text":"The owner is someone who is old school and takes pride in his food with fresh ingredients. The salad sucked but it was a dumb idea of me to even get one. This is a mom and pop shop come here for the traditional favs not salad. the eggplant Parmesan was a dream. Will surely. Be back"}
{"text":"Big fan of their sandwiches. The owner is a real nice guy and does a good job. I should get over here for lunch more often!"}
{"text":"Tried their chicken sandwich and enjoyed every bite. Ingredients were very fresh and tasty. Very friendly service. They also sell my childhood favorite drinks from The Pop shop."}
