{"text":"I had lunch there today with a co-worker. I was buying so I told him to get what ever he wanted.  Free chips and salsa - not bad, chips are large and best of all - free, get all you want Salsa - good mix of chili's with typical salsa ingredients Two taco plate lunch special - ground beef was boring and bland, taco shells not so good Rice - Did not eat - not appetizing to me Beans - Not bad, had yellow cheese on them, edible   Service was first rate - Amy is a rock star.  So So lunch. I would not order the two taco lunch again. I do like their Albondigas soup and ordered a side of soup to go. Thanks"}
{"text":"It's two stars thanks to our server's brutal honesty. He let us know that half the menu wasn't worth ordering. He also disappeared for long stretches of time.   I tried to order the chicken soup, thinking it was chicken tortilla soup. Nope. Our server let me know it's $3.75 for a cup of Campbell's chicken noodle soup.   I got the chicken enchilada and tamale plate. The enchilada was good enough and the tamale had no filling. Our margaritas tasted like straight citric acid, but they got the job done.   All in all, nope."}
{"text":"Tee Pee used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city, but upon recently revisiting, they're no longer a stand out. Expect traditional, Sonoran-style Mexican food that's good but not great. If you're in the area craving some Mex, I wouldn't tell you to avoid it, but I won't be rushing back here any time soon...they're not much better than some Mexican restaurant chains."}
{"text":"This place is not even mediocre. Upon entering we were sat immediately, seeing as the restaurant wasn't all that busy. We were greeted at our seat pretty quickly and the server was friendly, and that is why I am giving this place two stars...it is definitely not for the food. Actually I take that partially back, the chips and salsa were good. The salsa was nice and spicy. I ordered the Mexican Pizza. It came on a thin tortilla with cheese, ground beef, onion, and a slice of green chili on each slice (I enjoyed the chili). I expect a Mexican Pizza to be thick and crunchy; however, this was flimsy and greasy. I couldn't even pick up a slice without it completely falling apart. In addition, I must have went through ten napkins trying to sop the grease from my hands. It was a little better when I piled salsa on top of each bite, but it was not something I would ever consider ordering again. My mom ordered the lunch special of two tacos with rice and beans. Now I cannot discuss the taste of her meal, because I didn't try it; however, the taco shells were just plain, out of the box hard corn taco shells. I've never understood why a Mexican restaurant wouldn't spend more time on the things that make Mexican restaurants great. Tortillas are amazing. I love them, and I think the majority of people feel the same way. This is why I cannot stand to see a boxed taco shell in a Mexican restaurant. I've made homemade taco shells at home in the past, and it is not hard. This one little thing would improve this place immensely. The service here was pretty good, but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I meet my sister here for lunch sometimes, one of the reasons is simply because they have their own parking lot!  The food isn't the best Mexican I have ever had, but it is pretty decent.  The service at lunch is always really efficient, they get you in and fed in about 30 minutes...perfect for lunch!  They give you two different salsas, and neither are for the faint of heart, both pack quite a bit of heat.  They usually have 3 lunch specials, which run around $7.  They do a good job with their version of Green Chile Beef and the beans are pretty good.  Overall, a good place when trying to meet someone downtown...consistent food and easy, free parking!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible all around.  Food tasteless, salsa weak, margs weak and watery.  Atmosphere very loud, ( game night) and still only about half full.  Restaurant very warm ( temp wise) waitress had sweat dripping.  Yum!  Only redeeming quality was patron  shots.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Its great that it's located by the stadium downtown. I can eat and leave my car while i watch a game. Ordered the beef fajitas. Best beans I've had in ages! Great bar selection and the bartender was friendly and attentive, seemed like he took pride in his work"}
{"text":"When it comes to my margaritas, I'm very, very picky.  Not too many restaurants/bars pass my margarita test.  Many claim to have the best margaritas in town only to come up short after drinking just one. But I have to give it up to the Tee Pee Tap Room. Anthony (the bartender) tried to convince me that his Blue Citrus jalapeño margarita was the bomb.  Well people I have to tell you;  he wasn't wrong.  In fact his margarita just made my top three spots in Phoenix to have a margarita.  The happy hour margarita is only $3.00!  Yes only $3.00   I highly recommended you try margarita.  Ask for Anthony and tell him Steve sent you.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Very good quality meat and perfect spices. I am surprised they don't have more 5 star ratings."}
{"text":"Sick after eating here... Don't recommend..."}
{"text":"Very good salsa. Cops from fresh tortillas.  Food was tasty.  Service was friendly.  Prices very reasonable.  Not much of a wine selection but hey what do you expect."}
{"text":"Ride the light rail from Tempe. Go to Monster Jam early to use Pit Pass. Take a break and walk to Tee Pee Tap Room for dinner. Return to Chase Field for Monster Jam Show.  Convenience alone, I'd give Tee Pee Tap Room 5 stars. Walking distance from Chase Field it's a great place to go that's off the beaten path and not quite as loud and chaotic as some of the other places surrounding the ballpark.  It's definitely not my favorite place for mexican food, but at a recent Monster Truck Jam with the 5 year old nephew and family we were able to break away and grab some food with the kids in a relaxed environment.   They have Negra Modelo, enough said. I can separate the foodie critic in me and appreciate the food service (which was excellent) and being able to enjoy a post-pit, pre-show dinner with a table for 8 even if it is just OK food."}
{"text":"Usually very pleased with Tee Pee, especially before a DBacks game. But tonight two really disappointing things happened. First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people. Most disappointing, though, was that my grandfather forgot his jacket in the booth when we left for the game. I called 20 min later from inside the ballpark and was told it couldn't be found. After the game my mom scoured the place and it was still MIA. Very sad to think it was taken."}
{"text":"Service - 1  Food - 1 Price - 3 Overall - rounded to a two, probably deserves less  Had a group of 7 on a Sunday morning.  The place is absolutely a ghost town except some drunks at the bar.  The guy sits us in an empty room and never comes back.  After a few birthdays he returns with two small salsas and a bowl of chips.  Looked at the tiny bit of chips and salsa and how many people we had and asked him to go get us more.  Three New Years later he comes back.  We put in our order.  Another year later our food comes out.  It was awful.  I ordered some chimichanga special he recommended.  Couldnt finish it.  Not because the size but because it was no good.  Looked around at everyone elses food.  Looked bad...real bad.  Even tried a bite of the wifes to confirm.  Yep.  Awful.  Will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Margaritas are delicious!!  Great Happy Hour also!! The bartender Anthony is very attentive and mixes great drinks!"}
{"text":"We had a little extra time before a Diamond Backs game and decided to stop in here for a couple beers.  The guy behind the bar was a total D-bag.  We ordered 2 pints and he didnt even fill our glasses up all the way.  After the game we stopped again, same thing.  Then we ordered 2 Jager bombs.  Instead of having separate glasses for the shot and red bull, he mixed them.  And he knew that wasn't the way youre supposed to make it because he made a comment about it.  The guy made several rude comments and seemed to be trying to get us out of there...and it's only 8:45. For the prices they charge here, i want my shots made the right way, my beer filled up and with a little less douchebaggery!  Only reason they get 2 stars is for the extremely convenient location and 3 flat screens in the bar area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The food and drinks were all terrible. The beer was stale, the meat in the tacos had no flavor at all. I ordered my daughter the chicken soup, it was literally a Campbell's soup with added chicken. The taco shells lacked flavor and were most likely store bought. Food was served on hot plates but was not hot itself. Worst money ever spent, I would have been better off eating fast food."}
{"text":"Tee Pee has been a family favorite of ours for 20+ years. It tends to be our meet-up spot on the weekends to sit at the bar, watch sports, and enjoy some authentic Mexican food! My dad and I love meeting up here for some quality father/daughter time! It has a dive-bar, cozy feel (which I love)! The service is always great and the food is always satisfying. I AM a creature of habit and always order the Albondigas soup (Mexican meatball soup) + rice inside and a small cheese crisp with green chilis and guacamole! Their house-made chips, hot sauce, and salsa are the bomb.com. I have been known to eat a whole bowl of chips and salsa to myself. Shh, don't tell. ;) If you're looking for a neighborhood favorite, authentic Mexican food joint, this is your place."}
{"text":"I was always skeptical of this place, but was pleasantly surprised today.  We checked it out for lunch and ate at the bar, so we could watch college football.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the service and food were great!  Our server was very friendly and extremely efficient.  The food was actually very good.  I enjoyed enchiladas with beans and rice and was very pleased with my choice."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews might mislead you.  Tee Pee is not great, but it is good.  Located right across the street from Chase Field, Tee Pee is convenient for a pre-Diamondbacks game meal or a beer, and offers reasonably priced parking if you are going to the game.    Food was surprisingly good.  I read the reviews and wasn't expecting much.  What I got was decent home-made salsa with good enough chips, and main courses that were plain good.  Prices are a fraction of what you'll find at the ball game.  Service was fast enough, though not exactly friendly.  I didn't mind.  Tee Pee exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I love the food.  It is old time Texmex Mexican food.  I have been eating at the TEE PEE on Indian School for 40 years and it is the gold standard Texmex.  Food is the same here.  Good spot before Dbacks game but have your Tum's reddy.  The place is special for me."}
{"text":"Omg! The food is horrible! I don't cook and I could have made better food! The Pitcher of Margaritas was so watered down that we had the Bartender (no where to be found) add more liqueur ( no we are not Alcoholics) Red and Green chili Burrito was absolutely Gross! It was so bad the Waitress asked us why we didn't finish our food?! I didn't want to be mean and tell her, Taco Bell taste better! I still tipped 20% but when she asked, if we wanted to take it home I had to laugh! Sorry but it just came out! When your date says: These beans taste funny?! You know everything else sucks too! And it did! Btw the bill was $71 and I still tipped! So here's another tip! Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"This is an oddly located Mexican dive walking distance from Chase Field. Don't be dissuaded by the 3 stars: It's a great place to satisfy a craving for Mexican food, beers et al before the game. I love the salsa. I'm just annoyed by its unpredictable hours, which are basically tied to game events.   It's got a festive atmosphere inside. Definitely more on the divey side than on the sterile touristy side. Entrees are cheap and chips and salsa are, as mandated by Arizona law, free.  NOTE: There are two Tee Pee Tap Rooms. (Try saying that 5 times in a row real fast). This isn't the more famous one, where President Bush ate a few years ago during a visit to Phoenix. I have no idea if the two restaurants are owned by the same family."}
{"text":"Just not a lot of flavor in my tacos. Not much fast at all. The chips they brought out were good but the rest was missing something.  Good service"}
{"text":"Divey place but very close to Chase field and the Diamondbacks baseball. Ordered the guacamole dip which was average at best. Ordered the bean and cheese dip which gained taste when added in the great salsa which came with tortilla chips immediately when we were seated. Fur lunch I ordered one fish taco which was ok. Overall, good service, but average food."}
{"text":"Been here a few of times for lunch.  The lunch specials are a good deal.  I agree with Jenn E., the food is not the best Mexican food around but it pretty good.    I also get the chicken chimi..."}
{"text":"We have ate her twice in the last 4  months, both times were prior to a D back and Suns game. It is a great spot to stop and satisy your hunger with thier mexican food. Food is good and portions are fair. On both separate occasions, I have to say that their service was extra fast. Both times, we only had enough time to go to the restroom and when we returned, food was at our table. It was the quickest service, which is a huge plus when your trying to get to a game!"}
{"text":"I think Tee Pee is getting a bit of a bad rap.  I come here frequently for lunch and haven't had any problems with the service outside of waiting a bit too long for drink refills (understandable during a busy lunch rush).  It's utility Sonoran style Mexican food and it does the job."}
{"text":"Came here before the Diamondbacks game last night & it wasn't bad. Paid $5 to park for dinner then the game. We sat in the bar area and was helped immediately. They do not have happy hour which is a bit of a bummer for me #HappyHourSnob.   Any who, we ordered a cheese crisp and it never came, but probably for the best, we were stuffed after our meals. I got the carne asada tacos & my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito. **Side note: there is a spicy symbol next to the carne asada items -- I asked how spicy and she said its the pico de gallo. I asked for it on the side and thank god I did, it was essentially minced jalapenos, sooooo spicy. I also should have gotten no lettuce on my tacos because they were covered, but that's just my personal preference.   Overall, food was A-OK, I would come back, but im not going to be craving it or anything. Total for 2 people -- 1 pitcher of bud light,  carne asada tacos (3), carne asada burrito, & 2 sides of sour cream = $36"}
{"text":"Solid place to hit up before a baseball game."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  I used to live by the original Indian School location and I remember those amazing margaritas!  However, this was a work-related lunch, so just ice tea for me today.   I loved their menu and specials.  I ordered a beef taco and chees enchilada.  They were fabulous!  Everyone loved their food - some felt the carnitas were a little spicy, but very flavorful.   Great variety of food and beverages.  Lots of fun baseball/sports décor.  Great place to come after the game."}
{"text":"The service here was so incredible. We came in before a game and sat in the bar area. The bartender was nice, kept checking in, and was also walking around making sure everyone was good on drinks. The $5 parking was also a plus. Great job."}
{"text":"One of the older Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, it definitely has that divey feel nailed down. Service was spectacular, the ambiance so-so, and the food above average. For example, I loved the various unusual tacos (both soft shell and hard shell) that you won't find in your run-of-the-mill TexMex place, but did not care for the salsa at all, with almost a bell-pepper taste. The margaritas were great and all-around, 3 of us finished a pitcher of margaritas shared an appetizer and ate meals that filled us to the gills, for $100 including a generous tip because our waiter was so attentive and pleasant. I'd recommend if you are looking for a no-frills place with good food. The outside patio has a smoking area that did drift over into the non-smoking area, so depending on whether you're a smoker or not, that may or may not be a benefit or detriment. Also: Bring cash! No credit cards are accepted!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times over several years and I have always liked this place. Although very out of the way for me, my wife and I were down in the area one evening and decided to eat here. Surprisingly, the parking lot was very empty and that's not a good sign in my book. Maybe things have changed since coming here a few years ago. Anyway, inside there was maybe a total of seven people. My wife wanted to leave. We did stay and sat in the dining room. There was only one other couple in there at 7:30 in the evening...not a good sign. Waiter service was a little slow, but he was friendly. The wife had a chicken burrito and said it was okay, I have the pork burrito and loved it. Hot chips and salsa were good. The only thing that really sucked was the iced tea. It just didn't have any flavor to it. It seemed pretty watered down."}
{"text":"Came here with 200+ Dodgers fans and they were well prepared. I ordered the Tee Pee Tap Special and it was great. Not a fan of lettuce so ordered it without it but it was definitely worth the $8.75. Nice Divey Mexican style restaurant to enjoy some food and drinks before the game. Atmosphere was basically provided by us since there was no other fan besides Dodgers Fans in the building. Over all great food and great experience."}
{"text":"2 stars for the service and speed, but don't expect inteligent cuisine. Quick and easy, not good and cheap."}
{"text":"Looks like I went to the wrong place. . .  I was hoping to go to the same Tee Pee Tap Room where the American Progressive band Cartoon first planned their compositions.  Apparently that was the OTHER Tee Pee Tap Room.  How was the food here?  Well, lets just say that we all know what The Great Cornholio does with \"tee pee\".  I ordered a two enchilada plate.  The refried beans tasted really fresh. . .from the can.  That was pretty much how the whole of the meal was.  It was edible, but not enjoyable.  I was hoping to have a decent meal in a place with some history, and instead I have a meal in the wrong restaurant that was on the bad side of mediocre.  There are many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The Tee Pee Tap Room (at least this place) is not one of them."}
{"text":"Talk about bad Mexican food.  Stale grocery store taco shells, boiled shredded beef, and the blandest refried beans you've ever had.  The salsa is decent, but that's about it.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Walking distance to Chase Field makes this a popular destination.   The Mexican food is very good, the drinks are cheap, they have a huge outdoor patio, a large bar area, and you can wobble over to the ballgame when you're finished.  If you get here early enough you can park in their own private lot for free."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was ok.  The service staff was friendly but didn't keep drinks flowing well.  How ever the flavors and food portions were nice. I would give them a solid 3"}
{"text":"Waited at our table for 25 minutes before we were helped, we were served cold food, and the waitress told us we couldn't split our checks between 2 people... Hmmm id say it was definitely not a good experience."}
{"text":"The fish tacos aren't miss leading. Best Fish Tacos!!! I've ever had. These are not your run of the mill deep fried rubbery fish tacos. They use well seasoned fish fillet not fried and not little bits and pieces. Big and fresh. I highly recommend them and that's coming from picky of an eater. Another big plus it's right next to chase field parking is free if you dine in during events."}
{"text":"This place isn't particularly bad. It's not particularly good either. I had the chicken enchiladas, the were fine but certainly not anything to write home about. It's not all that cheap either. Long story short, if you are in Phoenix looking for some really good Mexican food, you can certainly do better."}
{"text":"I have read several reviews of this place its good food ... i have read that its food is not good or not authentic but this is not taco bell or garcias this food that our nana and moms make real rice and beans salsa is ok but the carne asada tacos great ! i"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in last week for a quick bite. Great chips and salsa, fresh chips and the salsa is house-made; with good heat. Machaca was very good, and ground beef tacos good too. It's very clean and the Mexican food is Sonoran/AZ style. Predictable, tasty, good but not awesome.  Lots of free parking and close to Chase Field!"}
