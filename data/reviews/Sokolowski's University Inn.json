{"text":"Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere. The cafeteria-style line is different but it made the experience unique. The piano player was a nice touch. My only complaint is the price tag - they have no servers but the final cost is a bit high for what you get, almost as if they've added in a gratuity anyway. 15% cheaper fare would get 5-stars from me."}
{"text":"very interesting place, special polish dishes, great experence"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's University Inn epitomizes the reason so many Mid-westerners are fat.  I'm not sure this place could exist in my home-state of California, but I'm sure glad it's here in Cleveland.

According to the sign outside, Sokolowski's was established in 1923, but I didn't find it until 2008.  We went here with a group of about 15 grad students from Case Western, and all of us were newbies to this purveyor of Polish fare.  As we entered, we were a little surprised to find that they serve food cafeteria-style.  This was a little disappointing at first, because we had come here in the hopes of having a semi-fancy meal, before heading off to a gala.  However, the Slavic victuals soon put any disappointment out of my head.

The menu is hand written daily and photo copied on a few dozen pieces of paper that are strewn throughout the restaurant for you to peruse as you move toward the serving area, where you'll get your oversized cafeteria tray and utensils.  Over the course of nearly a dozen dinner-time visits, I have found that you often have to endure a queue that snakes through one of the dining rooms, through the bar and finally to the serving area, with its stainless steel steam trays and chilled desserts.

The entree offerings change fairly regularly, but there are a few staples it seems, including Polish staples like kielbasa and stuffed cabbage - As one who eschews meat of the porcine variety, I haven't tried a the sausages, but the stuffed cabbage is rather tasty with a tangy tomato sauce, very similar to the one made by my own Jewish grandmother. I have tried a hand full of different dishes there, including Wienerschnitzel, Chicken Paprikash, Prime Rib, Rib Eye Steak, Fried Perch, and a few others.  I always found them quite tasty, but the atmosphere adds to the experience to make the food even more pleasurable than it would be on its own, say if you were to eat the same thing at home.  The walls are a collection of Cleveland and Sokolowski family memorabilia, and the two often overlap.  There are old newspaper clippings and photos, signs and posters, and other assorted stuff that you wouldn't ever think to put on the walls of your own eatery, but here they seem perfectly in order.

My absolute favorite item there, by far, however, is one of their staple side dishes ... the pierogi.  You will see this repeated by many of my peers throughout the many reviews of Sokolowski's, and deservedly so.  They let you choose two sides with your entree, and more often than not, I get pierogi for both. Every great eatery - from those with Michelin stars to those that serve from a street cart - has to have something that sets them apart, and for Sokolowski's it's the pierogi. They are delicious, tender potato filled pasta that are smothered in sauteed onions and butter.  They are no friend to your arteries, but with each bite they give your tongue a little hug that makes it nearly impossible not to smile like a besotted middle-schooler as you eat them.

They have other side dishes too, including noodles with cabbage, mashed potatoes, vegetables and others I barely notice.  There's also a salad bar that is included with your meal.  It has rudimentary salad fixings, including a large bowl of chopped lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, etc.  But what I like best about the it is the selection of Eastern European \"salads,\" including thick potato salad, macaroni salad, cucumbers with dill and sour cream, and the pickled beets.  You could make a meal of these and a side of pierogi, and still your arteries would howl with indignance ... I'd still ignore their screams, because it's just that tasty.

Why only four stars when I like this place so much?  There are a few aspects that detract from the experience: the queuing up & waiting is not the most entertaining way to spend your pre-meal time. Another biggie is their hours of operation.  They aren't open for dinner on weekdays, and on weekends, they close at 9p, which means a dinnertime craving of pierogi on a Wednesday evening must go unmet.

Nevertheless, this place wouldn't have been around for almost 90 years if there wasn't something special about it.  Go, eat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome. A must-go if you're new to Cleveland. On some days, they'll have a piano player in there. Tip him and ask him to play \"As Time Goes By\" for me."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great view of the city. I have to go back to try their stuffed cabbages."}
{"text":"Firs time eating at Sokolowski's pork chops are wonderful cuts with a butter knife mashed potatoes real mashed potatoes green beans to dye for"}
{"text":"Step back into yesterday when home cooking was the food everyone ate and thrived on, when choosing what visually pleased you was more enticing than any menu list to read, when the aromas were captivating, the atmosphere was inviting and smacked of warm hugs and laughter.  Absolutely a gem all its own and if you haven't been to the University Inn, you haven't 'felt' the pulse of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum... Was just there the other day.  We were lucky because we got there around 2:30 and no line!!! (They close at 3:00) The food was as good as it gets. The music in the bar was great too.  The owner Mike was very nice and we had a long and very enjoyable conversation with him.  Great place and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Sokolowski's was amazing! The portions were huge and all of the food is all comfort food and makes you feel like you are enjoying a good old fashioned home cooked meal like grandmother used to make!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Sokolowskis because it's a Cleveland institution. I loved the atmosphere, the beer list, the history, the view, and the service was fantastic. However, there was no excuse for the food. The mac n cheese was over boiled, mushy, and didn't taste like much. The veggies were just boiled frozen veggies. The sauerkraut was hands down the worst I've ever had; it was mushy, brown, watery and only tasted of malt vinegar. The pierogis were ok, but they were essentially given to us in butter soup. I understand that Sokolowskis specializes in comfort food, but lard and butter shouldn't replace flavor."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sokolowski's for years and have never been disappointed.  This is a family-owned business and the Bernie the owner is one great guy who likes to give back to the community.  The food is exceptional and priced very reasonably.  If I met someone visiting Cleveland who asked me where is a good place to go for dinner, Sokolowski's would most certainly be one of my recommendations (unlike Sterle's which has been on a decline since it changed ownership).  People should call for business hours before going since they only serve dinner on weekends and close early during the week."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Sokolowski's. I had seen the restaurant on a food channel show and wanted to try take a trip to Cleveland just to eat there. I finally got my chance on a weekend trip with wife. I was not disappointed, the portions of food that you receive are more than enough for the biggest appetite. The only the reason I did not give 5 stars, was due to some of the food being a little under seasoned. I had the 2 pork chop dinner and my wife had the stuffed cabbage. The stuffed cabbage was the biggest one I had ever seen, we both got the cabbage and noodles as well as peroggies, the peroggies were the best I have ever tasted. If you in the Cleveland area, you must put the place on your list"}
{"text":"I'm a nice half-Polish girl and I wanted to try something different when I headed to Cleveland this past weekend.  I had tickets to the Indian's game and wanted a nice meal with local flavor before the game.  

I used my Yelp! resources and my 3G as my friend drove us across the state.  I bookmarked Sokolowski's and then pulled up their website.  I started watching the clips from 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate' and 'No Reservations'.  We mapped the route and counted down the time until we would arrive.  Then I started reading the Yelp! reviews...

I started getting anxiety about the 150 people in line snaking around the building, wondering about parking, worried that I wouldn't know what to order and that i'd hold up the line...worried because I didn't bring any Pepcid with me.

So we got there around 5:30 on Saturday and we scored a parking spot right out front.  (cool view of Cleveland downtown BTW).  Several large families were coming out as we were going in and I worried, \"Why is everyone leaving?\" - but they were leaving with smiling faces, full bellies, and take out boxes.  As we wound our way around the bar and saw the stack of trays, then the display of desserts, I knew we were in the right place.  All of my anxiety evaporated.

I grabbed a piece of probable Turtle Cheesecake (chocolate mousse-like cake with cashews dipped in caramel as the topping) and my friend grabbed a slice of carrot cake (lots of nuts, raisins, etc inside).  Moving down the line I liked the look of a breaded meat (it was pork) so I went with the Chicken Paprikash (sides of green beans and mashed potatoes), my friend went with the cabbage roll (sides of dumplings and pierogies).  We chose a Russian and a Polish beer (Baltika and Stawski) in nice big bottles.  On top of the entree station there was a basket of rolls and the sign told us we were entitled to one each.

At the cashier we were offered beer glasses, butter, water, and plates for the salad bar??  - the bill was $49 - we paid and a nice boy escorted us to our table.  There were very few people there so we had a few different seating options. All areas are plastered with Polish artifacts  - our area was ripe with Pope John Paul II tsotske (am i going to hell for saying that?).

The food was good.  I really liked the Chicken Paprikash.  The chicken was tender and it was drenched in a sweet and savory sauce.  The mashed potatoes were delicious - i think they were potatoes and butter.  Pierogies also, yummy and butter laden.  The beer was potent.  The roll was amazing - fresh, doughy, and rolled in garlic salt.  We never touched our salad bowls.  The scouting mission to the salad bar found 3 types of pudding, several condiments, some beets, lettuce and a few other veggies.  

I had a great evening once my anxiety wore off.  I'd probably head here again someday but if I were local it may be only a yearly pilgrimage.  It was an experience.  It is cool.  It is different.  The food is good and filling.  All in all it is a great time.  I may have run screaming if there really was a line of 150 people in front of me."}
{"text":"Polish food at its finest, my family and I love this restaurant!  The few times we have been there, it was very crowded, but worth the wait!  Their pierogies are to die for - oh, so good!  Their polish sausage is excellent too, along with their other sides.  It is cafeteria style, which isn't the norm these days, but the line goes quickly.  YUM!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in you smell the good cooking being done. They have so many choices to choose from I had the salisbury steak and mashed potatoes and the red cabbage fantastic.  My wife had the breaded pork chop, mashed potatoes and a side order of noodles string beans and beets. The pork chop was very tender easy to cut with a knife and fork.
For dinner time at the hotel we picked up a dozen of their famous pierogies and yes they are fantastic!!!!
Come early, this place is busy, WE'LL WORTH IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a heart attack ready to happen.  It's so good, but not so good for you.  The ultimate comfort food restaurant.  The portions are huge and tasty."}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading reviews on Yelp, and thank God I did. It is not only an awesomely quaint restaurant with eclectic decor, but it has the BEST Polish food I've ever had in a restaurant. The pierogi melts in your mouth, the stuffed cabbage (golombki) tastes like my Babcia made it, and even the side dish of green beans were amazing. 
If you find yourself within 50 miles of Cleveland, go eat at Sokolowski's!"}
{"text":"Pierogies are everything everyone says.  Everything else was tasty as well.  We did wait in line a bit but it was worth it, for sure.  Fair pricing, plenty of seating.  Great first visit of many, I am sure!"}
{"text":"It was good but I was somewhat disappointed because of all the hype it gets. It has strange hours and it pretty basic food. The portion sizes are phenomenal and it  is traditional polish home cooked food. Definitely worth a try especially since it is a staple in Cleveland but I'm in no hurry to make it back."}
{"text":"Excellent Polish food in a totally unique house/cafeteria line setting. I had the meatloaf with pierogies and loved it. Also had a really good quality salad bar and friendly service. Just such a quaint homely atmosphere: I'd highly recommend it if you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome!

Cafeteria style ordering which was a bit of surprise. But have no fear, awesome service and awesome food. Visited with some family from California which somehow got mentioned to the cashier and she happily piled up a plate of free pierogies for traveling so far. 

Your plate may not looked as filled as you would like but trust me that you'll feel plenty full when you are done eating. The pierogis are wonderful and I'd highly suggest at least getting a side of them if not for your main dish. Heck I'd consider getting pierogis as the main dish and both sides if I went again."}
{"text":"I visited Sokolowski's in mid-November, 2010. I had heard it reviewed on the NPR show \"The Splendid Table.\"  Link: goo.gl/EPqW5
I was not disappointed! My  was excellent, as was everything my friends had. The portions were generous, but not overwhelming. The staff was friendly and prompt--not pushy. 
Thanks for a great introduction to the many cuisines of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Best Polish food around. The family has had this business in Cleveland for decades and is a favorite to the area. The pierogi dish is second to none and the best I have ever had. Get there on time because the line will wrap around the building."}
{"text":"If you are in the need of some comfort food this is a great place. Freshly made, close to authentic, wholesome Polish food accompanied by a friendly family atmosphere. The portions are very large so if you get a full dinner you will probably be taking home tomorrow's lunch, or you may just loosen your belt buckle a notch. I also highly recommend finishing off the \"waist line? why bother\" experience with desserts.Trust me, you want the desserts. They are fantastic and remind me of something my grandma might have baked for a church fundraiser. The only complaint that I have, and the reason I did not give 5 stars, is the limited opening hours and the sometimes long line in order to get food and I wish drinks were easier to refill."}
{"text":"I have only been to Sokolowski's once but it felt like I was eating with family. Very friendly, GREAT FOOD, huge portions, and priced very reasonable. Keep up the good work Sokolowski's!!!"}
{"text":"The food was only ok, but I'm bumping from 2 stars to 3 because of the great old-school cafeteria ambience and the man playing Christmas carols on the piano.

I got the pierogi lunch (5 pierogi, 2 sides, and a roll, for less than $10).  I was really looking forward to the pierogi, given the reviews here, but I found them pretty unremarkable, not memorably tender or tasty (the potato cheese filling was pretty bland).  I've had many better pierogi in my life.

For sides, I got a potato pancake and sauerkraut.  The potato pancake had some sort of creamy binder that I found slightly unpleasant, and the was no crispiness to the pancake.  The sauerkraut was on the bland side.

The food certainly wasn't terrible, but it really didn't meet my Polish comfort food expectations."}
{"text":"The food was yummy - the pierogies were our favorite. I just think the price is a little steep - we paid over $40 for 2 people and the restaurant itself is not that nice. We got there early enough that the wait was not long. But when we left, the line was insane. I don't think I would ever wait that long for this place...."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is one of the fantastic Cleveland places I wax poetic about now that I live in San Francisco.  

This family-owned, old world Polish cafeteria wrote the book on comfort food:  huge, buttery portions of pierogies, kielbasy, sauerkraut, and the like in a cozy atmosphere that feels like a cross between your babka's basement and your favorite neighborhood tavern.  

The restrooms are tucked into odd corners, and the walls are covered in newspaper clippings and photos of famous diners.  There is good, live piano/accordian music some nights.  

While the heavy food may make you want to skip dessert, don't!  Take one of the rich, European chocolate tortes or perfect apple streudel to go.  

Sokolowski's is a real slice of Cleveland, making it a great place to take adventurous out of town guests.  Go on a snowy night, and you'll leave warmed through and through."}
{"text":"Don't get confused if you walk in and see a sea of old (really old) people in line at Sokolowski's University Inn. No, you are not in the Geriatrics unit at St. Luke's. It reminded me of a morning run at Hardee's. I was a little scared for what was about to happen.

But have no fear. The food was excellent. It was homey and nice. Authentic Polish and Eastern European cuisine. Just one advice: Be sure to prep before visiting. Don't eat the day of because you will want to taste all the amazing food that they offer. I know I did.

During our visit, I had the pierogies & stuffed cabbage accompanied by Corsendonk abbey brown ale. Pierogies were excellent. The stuffed cabbage on the other hand was good but it was a little sweeter than the usual stuffed cabbage that the Lover's mom makes for us. I didn't like it as much. I was sooo stuffed but still wanted to finish my plate. 

I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of parking spaces."}
{"text":"Awesome! Out of all the Polish/northern European restaurant's,this is by far the best. Food is fresh well prepared,and generously given. Lots of choices when it comes to imported and domestic beers.
Arrive early as parking is at a premium. Also the line gets longer as the night goes on. This is a Cafeteria style restaurant. Check out website for details about menu and nightly specials.
  This is my first choice when asked where do you want to go eat!"}
{"text":"A Treemont institution, it requires your attention. Cafeteria style so expect a line (but it goes fast and is worth it). They have a wide range of Polish, comfort food staples..always very good. A good place for groups as it's deceptively large inside. They offer a wide selection of drinks as well, including old fashioned soda."}
{"text":"This was a complete disappointment.  I sought out an old Cleveland restaurant and the positive reviews led me here.  I've been to Polish restaurants before and this was awful.   Reheated tasteless cafeteria food.  They need to put some care and quality control into their cooking instead of mass producing."}
{"text":"after living in downtown cleveland since 2008, this is my favorite restaurant.  the amount and quality of food you get for the price cannot be beat.  it is a casual atmosphere (food served cafeteria style) yet can still allow for a quaint \"inn -like\" scene for a date or gathering of friends and family.  They have a piano player on the weekends. I had my rehearsal dinner here! I may be biased because I am 1/4 polish, but i love everything.  my favorite BY far are the pierogies with sour cream.  I have never had any better than here and I grew up with them.  next fav is chicken paprikash.  but the stuffed cabbage, breaded porkchops, baked scrod, and everything else is great.  portion sizes are HUGE.  still my favorite restaurant in cleveland after 6+ years.  I may go tonight now that I am thinking of it!"}
{"text":"For years this place was only a legend to me; a rumored fairy tale house of pierogi that appeared only if you wanted it badly enough and went at PRECISELY the right time. Behold, one day I was in Cleveland and it wasn't close enough to a holiday for them to be closed - oh yes, I dashed across the proverbial moat and jumped in line doing a little dance.

I'm a Polish girl who grew up on homemade Polish food, so I can be a bit elitist about places like this and what they do. Let me tell you: hands down, this place is INCREDIBLE.

The pierogi was soft and sinfully savory, and the cheesy mashed potato filling tasted like the tears of St. Stanis?aw. The chicken paprikash was tender with a perfect sauce. I would totally go back and get the pierogi dinner with a side of pierogi and regret nothing.

We showed up right at 4pm on Saturday and yes, we waited in line about 45 minutes, but it was worth it I tell you. On our way out, we ran into Mr. Sokolowski himself. I hugged him and told him \"dziekuje\", and I may have let out a SQUEE when he sweetly responded, \"dobrze\".

Go forth to Sokolowski's and all your pierogi dreams shall come true."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants. And easily the best pierogies I've ever had. Huge portions and a great view of downtown from where you'll park."}
{"text":"Best home-cooked food you will find! Perfect spot and an awesome view of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"An old fashioned Polish cafeteria style restaurant.  Great selection of food: pierogies, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa.  Great dessert and beer.  Fun experience."}
{"text":"This is down-home cooking - exactly what Cleveland is all about.  Polish and Eastern European dishes that are full size and exemplify this style of eating.  The cabbage rolls are HUGE! We also got the pirogues, pork schnitzel and chicken paprikash. Oh and a Polish lager too.  All were delicious.  Don't let the line keep you away. People line up because its that good and..the line moves fast.  Lots of seating. Friendly folks. Don't miss it. And when you leave, there's one of the best views of the Cleveland skyline just outside the front door!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place.  Sits up above the river, which is nice.  Good food, very authentic Polish, but a bit pricey for cafeteria style.  Very good food, and decent portions."}
{"text":"Great Polish food served cafeteria line style.  Pierogis were fantastic!  Everyone behind the counter and in the restaurant were super nice and friendly!  It was easy to maneuver using the trays and ordering like the assembly line style, especially if you are not familiar with the place or type of food.  I didn't particularly care for the cabbage today, but not enough to ever keep me away. This place is a must with such special ambiance! Glad we came."}
{"text":"This Chicago girl dreams of returning. Best Polish food - tastes like it came from my grandma's kitchen. Weird weekend hours so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great home cooked meals at a great price. Great atmosphere and cafeteria-style So no waiting."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good homestyle meal... Sokolowski's is the place to dine at!  It's got an amazing value for really delicious food.  This is definetly not a place if you are on a diet, so bring your appetite!!

Their salisbury steak, pierogis, mashed potatoes, dumplings... i could go on and on... are just fantastic!  Oh and the desserts.... the coconut cream pie is AMAZING!!!  

I will admit that this place does get a bit crowded, so get there early! My only other beef with this place is that they are only open during lunch on the weekdays and dinner ONLY on Saturdays.  I wish they were open more frequently, but it's probably good that it's not because i'd probably 400 pounds if they were.  

 Wear your stretchy pants and enjoy one of Cleveland's treasures!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for low-key, no frills home cooking, this is your place!!! We come here about twice a year and it's exactly how we remember it. They even gotten better with their \"seat yourself\" eating area. We usually have about 10 of us in our group and the last time we were there, they had people who carried out trays to a table for all of us. Win!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant out. Parking was a challenge, but I  didn't mind because crowds usually mean something is worth the wait. Apparently we came in on the back side of the restaurant. There is not a hostess or a sign so it was difficult to figure out where to go. A patron was kind enough to direct us while staff ignored us. We made our way to the cafeteria line and were excited to try some of the many interesting items. We choose pierogis, cabbage and noodles, and chicken paparkash. There was some confusion again because we didn't know the food came with sides and bread - and then again, were we supposed to seat ourselves?  It would have been helpful to have someone explain the process. The food was decent, but not quite to the quality I expected.  There was a lot of oil with the pierogis and I wasn't crazy about the cabbage dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've had better. Not quite what I expected."}
{"text":"Let's just say this, if I were on death row and was asked to decide on a final meal, I would say \"Chicken Paprikash and Pierogi's from Sokolowski's\"."}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland, this is a must visit!! The stuffed cabbage and pierogis are two of the best things I've ever eaten. I've even tried to recreate them at home, with limited success. The line will be wrapped around the building, but it's worth the wait. Just grab a drink at the bar and check out all the cool decor!"}
{"text":"The place is an absolute joke, the pierogi are really thick like out of a frozen pierogi box they are drenched in grease and definitely nothing special. The owner is a clown and overall this just isn't a good Polish food place if you want authentic Polish food. Unfortunately there really are no authentic Polish food places in Cleveland Ohio if you want some authentic Polish food you have to get to know a hard working Polish person who really knows how to cook it which is definitely not the owner or Sokolowski's. Trust me I know what I am talking about and the best Polish food that I ever ate came from my mothers and grandmothers cooking. Ps. Even Seven Roses has better food than this pile of mess.

THIS IS NOT REAL POLISH FOOD ESPECIALLY THAT IT IS DRENCHED IN SO MUCH 
GREASE EVEN IN THE PICTURES YOU CAN SEE HOW DISGUSTING SOME OF THE
FOOD LOOKS."}
{"text":"I'm a Cleveland native and a huge fan of all Michael Symons restaurants, so when seeing this place on the food network how could I not try it. 
First off, it's very confusing when you walk into the place. There are no signs or greeters telling you where to sit, how the restaurant works, how/where you order. If I didn't know the concept of how things work already I would have been completely lost instead of mildly confused. Finally stumbled upon the lunch line, yes I said lunch line. Get your tray and utensils and line up! I can see the draw to this way of serving, especially for people that need a quick meal on their lunch hour, but others may not like the pre made food.     
The food, we ordered perogies, potato pancakes, Mac and cheese, and Salisbury steak. Not much filling in the perogies and I prefer them fried and crispy. The potato pancakes were just alright. I honestly think I make better perogies and potato pancakes myself. The Mac and cheese needed salt and wasn't anything special. The Salisbury steak was the highlight I thought and I almost didn't order it but I needed something other than pure starch. Huge piece of meat with gravy, mushrooms and onions.
Over all it was a cool experience but I probably wouldn't go back. Cleveland has way too many awesome restaurants to try. I can see the comfort food draw that this place presents."}
{"text":"I'm from DC and grew up in Minnesota, and came here based on a recommendation from work. Food is fantastic! Where I'm from/currently live my access to Polish food is limited. The portions are huge and very reasonable in price. The decor is very much so a farmhouse and has the feel of a hometown sit down type place. You get your food almost immediately and it's hot and delicious!! I'm only in town for two days but would love to come here again!


The stuffed cabbage rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"Dear Cleveland, I love you and I love Sokolowski's!  Great neighborhood and really great food.  I love bringing guests from out of town here.  Cheap and cheerful and great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed with the food.  Pierogis were good but they're good lots of other places too.  Overly greasy food in my opinion.  Very poor service.  Was forced to change tables in the middle of our meal, with a toddler in tow.  Apparently the staff sat us at a reserved table.  Management apologized after we complained, but it didn't make up for the poor experience, especially at their prices.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Very over priced for bland greasy food. I got 6 perogies, asparagus,dumplings and a slice of pie... boyfriend got veal, cabbage,and 2 perogies and slice of pie...$48. way too expensive for bland food. Atmosphere was nice though.."}
{"text":"I can feel my arteries clogging and my waistline expanding, right now, as we speak.  I'm certain that I will not need to eat again, for at least a week.

This place is a cafeteria style, east European mainstay.  If you like pierogies, kielbasa, stuffed peppers, sour cream, and anything that floats in butter, you'll love Sokolowki's.    It's best on one of those dreary, snowy, grey wintery Cleveland days, when you can sit in front of the fireplace and want to eat comfort food."}
{"text":"A Cleveland institution! Polka, pierogi, pies and sausage. They'll try to draw you in with huge pieces of pie and cake at the beginning of the cafeteria line. That's because once they load you up with food, you'd never consider taking a piece! 

Your first question might be, \"what university? I don't see any university around here...\" Why, Cleveland University, of course. You know the place has been around for a while if it's named after a school that flopped in 1852 after graduating only 11 people. (The restaurant opened in 1923, so it's probably just named after the street... but still!)

Tony Bourdain, Michael Symon and Bill Clinton haven't gone wrong. The meat, pierogi, cabbage and noodles - all delicious.

The walls are covered in photos from Cleveland's past.

Note the limited hours - they're open only for lunch on weekdays (11-3) and dinner Friday (5-9) and Saturday (4-9).

No one leaves hungry - they'll force two sides and a roll to go alongside your ample main course. Almost everything on the menu is $7.25, including all of the above.

Be sure to bring an extra $15 for the most street-cred-worthy graphic T in 216."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter to Sokolowski's this past Friday.  It was the first time for both of us.  Loved the traditional \"old time\" decor and the staff was very helpful.  I ordered the Stuffed Cabbage with a side of Pierogies.  It was a really large portion, especially for lunch, but it was very good!  I wish they were open more hours - only lunch hours during the week and the Friday and Saturday evenings.  I live about an hour away so it's hard to get here very often with the limited hours.  That said, we'll be sure to get back here as often as we can.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"my dad has been raving about this place for the longest time, and i went in there the for the first time really trying hard not to like it, just so i didn't have to give him the satisfaction of being right, but ill be damned if this place wasn't awesome, really a Cleveland institution. The first time I dined here i was probably 15 fresh off my stellar rookie season of 8th grade football. They had a dick butkiss jersey hanging behind the register and I mentioned to the owner I was number 51 as well. This man decided to give me the feast on the house and insisted I try everything, my parents had to roll me out of there as i felt, and probably looked like Augustus gloop. that free meal was the best business move that man ever made because I have returned countless times, brining new people everytime. I only have one thing to say about the food, it is delicious ethnic polish food and anything but light, weight watcher need not apply.

PS the piano man on saturday night is great."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place - the food, the staff, the drinks, the building, the decor. Perfection."}
{"text":"Best taste of Cleveland.  Pierogies and Salisbury steak is to die for!  Kitschy Cleveland memorabilia along with a Papal shrine make it a one of a kind can't miss spot to see and experience in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this funky, unsuspecting place. Even if there's a long line, once you get food there is always a table for you. I love that it's cafeteria-style- very unique and homey. But don't come here if you're trying to avoid carbs- that's what they do best! Chicken paprikash is excellent- esp served on top of mashed potatoes! This is the place to load up on piergies and stuffed cabbage. Salad bar is pretty decent. Desserts have all been tasty too, if you've left enough room for them. We always end up taking home enough food for a second meal. Such a gem of a restaurant- definitely worth bringing your out of town friends/family."}
{"text":"Holy butter! Definitely comfort food. The cabbage roll was perfect. Tender, flavorful, and perfect. Mac n cheese was soggy and not that great. Cabbage and noodles was alright after adding some salt and pepper. Loved the dinner roll. Saving the best for last: the pierogies!! It was delicious after removing it from the butter that it was drowned in. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Missing your grandmother? Come here. Sokolowski's will be the best grandmother you ever had. The grandmother of your wildest dreams. Serving endless helpings of slow cooked homey buttery goodness with a side of extra love. This place is full of the most adorable tchotchkes that the coolest grandma would collect. And filled with pictures of the family.....if your family was chockfull of presidents, singers, actors and general all around badasses.

Rules of engagement: Sokolowski's is a different breed of eating establishment. Be sure to check any of your pretensions at the door, and perhaps be ready to wear a bib to dive headfirst into a pool of pierogi. This restaurant is basically only open for lunch, and for limited hours. The food is Polish mixed with Midwest comfort classics. It almost always has a line. It's a cafeteria style ordering system: you first get your plastic tray, then you load it up with goodies (desserts first!), and then one of the Sokolowski brothers rings you up at the end before you sit down with your tray. Prices are very reasonable for the quantities served. It almost always is playing polka music, or has a great older gentleman tickling the ivories in one of the many rooms. You've doing it right if you're too full to polka for a week after you roll yourself out of here. 

You can't go wrong with any of the food. I'm especially enamored with the homemade chocolate cream pie and the Salisbury steak. You also cannot avoid the butter avalanche, so just embrace it with open arms. Heck, ask for extra ladles of delicious butter sauce pooling over the hearty pierogis. After all, this meal will probably last you for the next three days if you want it to."}
{"text":"Had a fun experience here! I really felt like I was at home here, surrounded by good people and wonderful food. We were a little worried about the line that went out the door but it moved fairly quickly and there were tables available once we had our food. Sokolowski's has the best perogi's Cleveland has to offer and they also have an enjoyable environment to eat to them in!"}
{"text":"The best polish food I've ever had....and I've lived all over the US!  Favorites include their stuffed cabbage, smoked kielbasa and perogies to die for!  Desserts are awesome as well.  The line is long (especially weekends) but well worth the wait...and we usually visit w people in line with us which is nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant did not disappoint! Met some ladies in line.... cafeteria style... who raved about the food.  We took their recommendations and ordered the pork chops and stuffed cabbage.... delicious! Fulfilling portions. We had enough food left to take home for the next day.  Couldn't leave without trying a perogies... we weren't disappointed.  Although there was a line thday wrapped around the restaurant it moved very quickly. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely visit this restaurant again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Saw this place featured on WKYC 3 in Cleveland. Can't say it enough awesome awesome awesome.......I had cabbage roll (size of a softball)and pierogies and Jim had pork chop (2) dinner
Both came with salad bar and 2 sides. 
Food was great!!! Atmosphere very good. We had a piano player in our room, added to the atmosphere .
Went early for Saturday night dinner and only had to wait about 10 min to get in. Food was well displayed and the staff was sooo nice. 
So much food in the meals we took home leftovers 
We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh holy pierogies. So good. 

I ate there for the first time last night and I'm already ready to go back. It's probably a good thing they're only open for lunch on weekdays. 

I feel the need to hit the gym just thinking about wanting more of their food."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fabulous. I got the meatloaf with 2 pierogies mac and cheese and steamed veggies, my mother got the stuffed cabbage, and my dad got the bbq ribs. I tried a little from everyone and was very impressed at how delicious everything was. My favorite by far was my meatloaf. Im pretty sure they use fennel in it which gives it a really nice flavor. Next was the pierogies. Although Im a fan of my pierogies being nice and crispy they were still very good. They also had a very good macaroni salad at the salad bar. If you come here come hungry because the portions are HUGE. I can understand some peoples gripe about the temperature of the food but the pure quality and flavor of everything surpasses that by a long shot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you are seriously hungry and ready to chow down on heavy, buttery, delicious food from your grandma's old country. The pierogis are swimming in clarified butter. The cabbage rolls are massive, and while no cabbage roll will ever be as good as my mom's, the tanginess of the tomato sauce and perfect texture of the boiled cabbage were impressive. The staff was friendly and ready to make recommendations (like skip your second veggie option and just do double pierogis) that we found very helpful. Will visit again when next in Cleveland."}
{"text":"dear sokolowski's,
god bless you and your perogis.  best meal i had while i was home. the judges gave it 4.5, 5, and 5.  the only reason that first judge gave it a 4.5 was because she didn't get to you sooner.  if she would have, there would have been more trips.  unfortunately, the judge waited until the second to last day she was home to visit you and your culinary godliness.

she won't make that mistake again.

you can do no wrong, sokolowski's.  no wrong at all."}
{"text":"Um, I cannot say enough good things about Sokolowski's. I went here with my mom (who is 50% Polish) yesterday for the first time. It has been on my Cleveland bucket list for food for a few years now, and boy, it did not disappoint. I was a little surprised by the \"cafeteria style\" ordering, but it was super easy to order food and the lunch line went very quickly. I got the periogi meal (6 of them plus 2 sides and a roll), and they were absolutely to die for! My mom got the steamed kielbasa sandwich, and she loved it. Thank you for creating such authentic Polish dishes - it takes me back to my grandma's cooking when I was growing up. I can't wait to take more of my family there to eat."}
{"text":"I made my first ever visit to Sokolowski's last week for a late lunch.  The view and the ambiance are the reasons for 4 stars.  The food was probably in the 2.5-3 star range.   Having just recently eaten at Olesia's Place in North Royalton, I was sorely disappointed by the pierogies and potato pancakes here.  The pierogies are served with some kind of vegetable (cabbage?  onion?  both?), but they were completely mush and had lost all flavor so I couldn't even tell what they were.  If you love butter, you'll like the pierogies here, because you can taste nothing else when eating them.   Also, I'd skip the salad bar; I sampled just about everything on it and couldn't find one thing worth paying an extra $1 for, let alone $3.  
My best recommendation is to go on a weekday for a late lunch. There were very few other people there, so we felt comfortable walking around and checking out all the photos and memorabilia on the walls.  It also helped not to feel rushed in the line when choosing my foods.  Obviously this is difficult for people to do, which is why it's taken me more than a decade of living in the Cleveland area to actually get here.  For the parents out there:  there is a changing table in the women's restroom, but not the men's.  We opted not to use it though because there didn't seem to be any heat in the women's room.

While we loved the smell and crackling of the fireplace, and the staff were exceptionally helpful and welcoming, I can't see myself coming back here anytime soon (due both to the hours and the lackluster food).  Maybe just to have a beer and enjoy the atmosphere, but I imagine the bar feels pretty claustrophobic when people are lined up for food.  I would highly recommend that everyone check it out once though."}
{"text":"I consider it a huge accomplishment that I left Sokolowski's and was not completely stuffed. It wasn't easy. But, reading other reviews and knowing the reputation, I was afraid of getting in over my head. So I planned to issue restraint. 

The line was very long, but it wasn't too bad because it gave me a chance to figure out what I wanted. There was also stuff (memorabilia lining the walls; interesting conversations to eavesdrop on) to distract me. In this way, the waiting experience was not unlike that of a wait for a Disneyland ride: people keep standing on tiptoes, craning their necks and peeking at what's around the bend. 

I immediately grabbed some chocolate cake. Well, duh! Since all \"dinners\" come with two sides, a roll, and the salad bar, we de decided that we'd only get one full meal, and the other would just order a dozen pierogies. Ha! \"Just\" a dozen. Anyway, it worked out great. My husband got the chicken paprikash, with mashed potatoes and corn. We decided not to get the roll - why bother? We shared a salad with great picked beets and greens. Everything was delicious!! We pulled the plug when we had four pierogies and half of the chicken left (we finished the sides). We also took the cake home. 

We were so proud of ourselves! We had a great meal and didn't feel like death afterwards. Oh, and the dining room is really cozy, with a pianist playing standards. We left with a great feeling. There's a sign in the place that says something like, \"Enter as strangers, leave as friends.\" i definitely like the sentiment."}
{"text":"After you wait in line that wraps around the entire restaurant dont waste any time with the salad. Pirogi submerged in a pool of butter and onions, go for the potato pancakes and sausage. So good i ordered a second full dinner to go... It never made it in the door, i ate it before i was out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure.  I think my father (from the Ukraine) teared up a little when he bit into the stuffed cabbage....

If you like authentic eastern European food, stop on in and enjoy"}
{"text":"Can you say, \"Tastes like Cleveland\"?  

After this wonderfully authentic experience of the eyes, ears and stomach, you will get a taste of Cleveland in all it's starchy - but yummy - glory!

Do not be intimidated by the very nice lady saying stuff to you as you approach your hot meal section of the cafeteria styled restaruant.  Grab your dessert, salad and drink and just smile, point and nod. 

Smile, point and nod.  That's all you need to know.

You will not go wrong with the Pirogies.  Yes, it is a fried starch pocket filled with more starch - potato in this case - but combine that with the mashed potatoes, gravy and sour cream and you pretty much have an Atkins dieter nightmare.  But oh so good.  Oh so good.

Go now."}
{"text":"A great place for old-fashioned comfort food. 

I was looking for a good place to eat fish during Lent and decided to go to Sokolowski's to try the perch. It was delicious!!  I had it with a side of Mac and Cheese and steamed veggies. The portion was satisfying and just right.

I had the pork chops on my first visit here and they were moist and delicious as well. Huge portions!

This restaurant offers a large variety of entrees complete with salad bar and desserts. The cheesecake with fresh strawberries was divine. And I like the Old World European charm of this place. It's very comfortable and welcoming. If you like food, you'll like it here!

I'll be back again to try the Salisbury Steak, Prime Rib and Chicken Paprikash. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here on a Saturday evening. Parking was was not abundant. There was a small bar as soon as you enter with a pleasant and helpful bartender to give directions if you haven't been there before. It's cafeteria style dining. Casual atmosphere. 
There were so many items to choose from! Mostly ethnic dishes. We had stuffed cabbage and chicken paprikash. Both were fantastic. Dinners include salad bar which was unnecessary, and unimpressive. 
Everyone was helpful and friendly. If it weren't for the parking and salad bar, I'd give 5 stars. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is so comforting! Heaping plates of mashed potatoes, tender chicken paprikash, and more. Their green beans, meats, pies, cakes, you name it really take the cake. You'll have to stand in line for at least 40 minutes on a weekend in this large buffet line that snakes around the restaurant, but it's worth it, and you'll be able to partially pass the time looking out their huge panoramic window sporting views of the city. A must visit if you're in Cleveland and looking for authentic Polish food! :)"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about this place. Beyond true. The food was amazing. I had the smoked kielbasa, mashed potatoes, green beans and some pierogies. You can taste the love. I had to get some to go for my mom. The portions are huge. You get a real value. No wonder this place is such a Cleveland treasure. The people who work there are wonderful. They are so helpful. You feel like part of the family. The decor is amazing. I even took pics. I liked the piano player as well. I can't wait to go back. Tip: Get there early."}
{"text":"Sokolowkski's is iconic, but I haven't been a fan of the food when I've gone.  It's family style dishes (meatloaf, cabbage rolls, pierogies, etc.) that I think speaks to a lot of people's nostalgia, so most people really enjoy it though. If you're in the area and have the chance, give it a try but I wouldn't go too far out of your way."}
{"text":"Traditional Polish comfort food + served in a cafeteria-like style operating since the 1920's = delicious food coma and a fully belly.

A group of co-workers and I made our monthly foodie adventure and the place we chose was unexpectedly closed, que a trip to Sokolowski's in its place...what a rock star move!  I had not been here in ages and most of the rest of the group had never been there, so we were all in for a treat.

So many good things to choose from.  As you pass through the cafeteria line you grad your tray, cup, silverware, etc. and start with...what else...desserts!  Home made pies, rice pudding, you name it.  Then it is on to the main dishes (one choice for your plate) and sides (two for your plate)...there is an assortment of each so there is probably something for every taste out there.  I choose the breaded pork chop (smothered in a brown onion gravy, mashed potatoes and corn.  You can also have a dinner role if you choose.  One of my buddies ordered the chicken paprikash and we split both meals.

The pork chop was boneless and huge, but not overly breaded or super-heavy.  Add in some mashed potatoes and gravy to the same bite...heaven.

The chicken paprikash and huge pieces of white meat chicken and spaetzle covered with that distinctly orange gravy, truly delicious.

I finished off my meal with a slice of cherry pie, and I was done for the day.  Fun, nostalgic atmosphere and great comfort food...man I love this place!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town (TEXAS). Wow. We loved every single bite! Standing in line to wait for this amazing food was no big deal! The food was well worth the wait!!  Ant wait to come back"}
{"text":"That dude Bruce is right on, this is what taking a bite out of Cleveland would taste like minus the arson and holding the homeless population. 

Man, peirogis are awesome and when you cover that shit in sauerkraut it's even better. This is the place to load up on all of that amazing food from immigrant countries. The sausage is a good way to get fat and stay happy while the decor is mix between your grandparent's basement and Drew Carey's den. 

A place to visit if you live in Cleveland or if you're passing through (and if you are, you should probably just consider staying for good)."}
{"text":"Never had anything here that wouldn't try again great food great atmosphere for great prices and the gentleman playing the piano puts the icing on the cake very family oriented"}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place less than a 5 star review is out of their mind! Staff is SUPER friendly! Food is sooooo delicious and the portions are HUGE! The line moves fairly quickly and goes right by the bar so you can grab a drink while you wait. The night we were there the bartender put out pretzel rods, popcorn, and the FRESHEST pork rinds I've ever had.  Don't eat too much of the snacks or you will have a hard time finishing your dinner. I got the chicken paprikash with dumplings and Brussel sprouts. My husband got the stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes and corn with a side of peirogie. Every thing was delicious and homemade!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Truly a legend to any Polish Cleveland native. My favorite meal here has to be the Salsbury Steak. Everything is great but IT is  to die for."}
{"text":"The ambience reminds me of a friendly neighborhood basement, in a good way. 
The food.....very yummy.  The fried fish batter was just the right level of crispyness.  The meatloaf was filling without being heavy.  And the peirogis, very excellent."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland Landmark restaurant since the 1920s. Old world Polish food served cafeteria style. Pierogi every day. All the food is home made right there. Arrive early for lunch, they fill up fast. 

If you are watching your weight, go somewhere else! If your cold or you need great comfort food, get your ass under the bridge and stop in for an old home style meal."}
{"text":"Sokolowskis is true ethnic cuisine. This cafeteria style family restaurant stays true to its history. Take a look at the menu offerings for the day, grab your cafeteria tray and make your way down the cafeteria line picking out your entrees and sides. 

Make sure you come with an appetite because this place does not skip on the portions. I was raised on my mother's chicken paprikash and this is the first place to surpass mom's home cooking. The paprikash was in itself more then enough but came with two sides. I opted for pierogies and cabbage. 

The dining room has not changed much over time and give a nostalgic feel that pairs well with all of the historic photos and memorabilia that cover its walls. This is a true taste of Cleveland's polish community."}
{"text":"University Inn gets my vote for BEST PLACE TO EAVESDROP ON ANOTHER TABLE'S CONVERSATION.  You will overhear some classic male-female older couple grumbling.  Funny stuff.  Plan to wear your elastic waistband pants to this Cleveland institution of a restaurant.  When you open the door to the place you are instantly greeted by the smell of:  comfort food.  This is a cafeteria-style restaurant that serves up some of the heaviest, butteriest, and tastiest food you've had in a long time.  The walls are lined with pictures from local superheroes and longtime friends of University Inn.  We went for dinner around 7pm and it wasn't that crowded.  All in all, a very good value.  I had the baked scrod and it came with two sides (I chose pierogis and yellow/green wax beans).  And of course the salad bar is included.  I think I heard my arteries slam shut while cutting into my bathed-in-butter baked scrod.  This by no means is a place to go if you are watching your weight but the food seriously is the best comfort food I've had in years.  The only challenge I have with this place is they'll serve food that's not featured on the menu.  So be sure to check out the food that is being served before you look at the menu.  I get sideways when I get down to the end of the food line and discover sweet potatoes and potato pancakes when I already chose two other side dishes!  Sheesh!  And good luck getting the chalkboard menu to be consistent with the paper menu.  They are never consistent!  But then again, that's the charm of University Inn..."}
{"text":"Heaven!!! Huge portions, absolutely delicious food! And an awesome atmosphere. Definitely a five star place."}
{"text":"Ate here during a Friday lunch while I was in town for a basketball game. Found the website and glowing reviews online prior to my trip, and was not disappointed in the least bit. Showed up about 20 minutes after they opened for lunch, so there was no wait at all!! If there was a line, I'll admit, it may have gotten 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4, but the damn good food may have compensated for this east coast girl's dislike for waiting. 

Had the baked fish (scrod?) and my boyfriend got the Salisbury steak, we both got mac and cheese and infamous pierogies to accompany it. The food was excellent, the mac and cheese a little less so than the rest (If I had thought about choosing pierogies for both of my sides I would have-DO IT). The prices were awesome in my opinion (especially compared to the DC prices of late), and the portions were HUGE. This meal acted as our breakfast and lunch, and we were not hungry for dinner until after 7. 
I obviously would not recommend eating like this every day, but an occasional indulgence never hurt anybody."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food.  Pierogies and stuffed cabbage were delicious.  Stuffed cabbage was the size of a softball.  Chicken Paprikash was good but lacked some seasoning.  Beer battered Cod lightly breaded and enjoyable.  Large portions and reasonably priced.  Very nice and friendly staff slinging the cafeteria style Polish fare."}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland, you need to go here. It's actual home-style cooking with insanely generous portions. Try the pierogis. They're the absolute best. Just had the chicken paprikash and it was to die for. Plus the staff treats you like family. Also, the Mac n cheese is great. Everything there is."}
{"text":"Probably the best and biggest portion of chicken paprakash I've ever had. great flavor, massive portion and best of all no mushrooms. Served with 2 side dishes- I had corn and mashed potatoes which were also good. Paprakash was fresh and authentic. Recommend going early so you don't have to wait in line!!"}
{"text":"Edible.  I grew up in a Polish neighborhood and do not understand why people stand in line to eat under-seasoned, incredibly average food served by bored cafeteria workers.  After watching Sokolowski's on PBS for years, I was really looking forward to eating there. I left underwhelmed and disappointed.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"A cleveland landmark with so may comfort food options to choose from.  All taste like grandma made them.  Super fast and casual dining room perfect for impressing friends with a down to earth Cleveland classic."}
{"text":"I grew up in a big-eating Polish family, and struck by a bit of nostalgia, I decided to try Sokolowski's.  In the past I might have given this place 4 or 5 stars, but I just don't eat like this anymore.  I've finally stopped contributing to the obesity epidemic by eating fresh, healthy, flavorful foods in reasonable quantities.  You will find none of the above there.  I knew it would be a bit of a splurge going in, but some splurges are worth it.  This is most definitely NOT worth it.  

You will wait in a ridiculous line for an enormous pile of food, and no matter what it is it will be swimming in grease.  I've never had Polish food that is *that* disgustingly rich.  I'm sorry folks, but grease is not a substitute for flavor.  You get a lot but pay a lot too, so for a more reasonable price and portion, plan on sharing.  You will also have to elbow your way through crowded dining rooms to hopefully have a chance at getting a seat.  I'll do you all a favor on that front, because I won't be back."}
{"text":"Overall: Cleveland staple and classic. Lots of good food for a reasonable price. You've got to try this place!

Food: Food tastes and looks homemade; not too fancy or heavily seasoned.  My fave entrees here are the stuffed cabbage and pierogies.  Chicken paprikash is also good.  Lower on the list is the veal schnitzel.  All of their sides are solid -- the brown gravy used on the mashed potatoes is superb.  Everything is earthy and filling. There is also a salad bar included.

Atmosphere: The food is served cafeteria style.  Grab your tray and tell the servers what you want.  Seat yourself wherever.  There is always live music.

Misc: They have limited hours so check the website before making the trip."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is so good and crave worthy. When we arrived, there was a line wrapped in the restaurant waiting to eat (but went fast). All the food is served cafeteria style, and there are different specials each day. There are several signs posted all around the restaurant so you know what new drinks, specials are available and events they are hosting. You get a tray and silverware and make your way down the line. SEVERAL desserts including pies and carrot cake. Pop, tea, and other beverages are available. The hot dishes today including beef stroganoff, stuffed cabbage, pierogi, mac n cheese, kielbasa, and some others. Sides include corn, green beans and some others as well. Each meal gets as many rolls as you want. The price is moderate and the portion sizes are HUGE and you can easily get one or two meals from left overs. Our trays were kindly carried by one of the workers to our table, and there was live piano music in the sitting area we were in! Parking can be hard at this spot and I recommend carpooling if meeting people and also calling a reserving a table if you have a big party."}
{"text":"Wow what a place, this place features many central and eastern european classic dishes, and its simple cafeteria style service allows you to see all the options before picking so you know what your going to get, the interior is like being home, very cozy and quaint. My favorite dishes are is the chicken paprika, and one of the few places that has rice pudding whisch if your a fan will appreciate."}
{"text":"stopped for lunch at Sokolowski's yesterday. it was my first time and i gotta say I liked it a lot. Danielle, not so much. 

i got a cabbage roll, mashed potatoes and corn. D got the baked scrod, mashed potatoes and rice pudding. i think she liked the pudding but she'd never had scrod before and didn't realize it's prepared with a lot of butter. she didn't care for the potatoes for some reason at all. 

my lunch was great. all of it. i had no problem with the taters and my cabbage roll was delicious and huge. 

i'd gladly go back again. the only issue i had was it was hard to understand the lady who was preparing our plates due to her accent but you'll have that, i guess."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant because we waited around an hour to get our food and it was rather overpriced. However, the service wasn't great and the food (except for the pierogies) was disappointing.

Like I mentioned, we waited around an hour to get our food. This was not because the kitchen was slow. Around 80% of the tables were empty, but the line was just moving very, very slowly. The layout of the restaurant was not designed for long lines, so I felt like I was in other people's way while we were waiting.

The employees who were serving us were also very unhelpful. I ordered the chicken paprikash with pierogies as both of my sides. I assumed that the chicken would come with dumplings or egg noodles. I was wrong, so I had to pay extra to get dumplings on the side (which I regret, because the dumplings were mushy and not that great). The signs were also not updated. They ran out of cabbage and noodles, but didn't notify the customers until they ordered. The chicken paprikash was just a single chicken breast with not much sauce. It was pretty dry so it would have been nice to have more than a couple tablespoons of sauce. The dumplings came in the same sauce, but again, not much sauce was provided.

The pierogies were delicious, 5/5 by themselves. However, it came in a pool of oil. I had to transfer my piergies to a different plate because I couldn't eat the pierogies without covering them in grease. It was also on the same plate as my chicken paprikash, so the oil mixed with the sauce of the paprikash, making the little sauce that was there inedible. Whoever was dishing out the pierogies was not very consistent, because my boyfriend's pierogies came with just a little bit of oil. 

The bread was decent and I did not try the salad bar or the desserts. The grease-filled plate kind of killed my appetite. For two people, I paid $35. Considering I only enjoyed the 4 pierogies and diet Coke I got, I don't consider that a very good deal. My boyfriend got the stuffed cabbage and finished it off, but he agreed that the pierogies were better.

If we were to go again, we would just get a dozen pierogies each and grab an extra plate to avoid eating an extra 1/2 cup of oil."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style ethnic food.  A great place to get some authentic eastern European \"stick-to-your-ribs\" meals.  They put the dessert at the front of the line and salad bar after while all the good stuff is in-between.  They also have a full bar if you'd like a beer to wash it all down.  They clean the table, you bring your appetite.  
It's a fun place to bring an out-of-town guest for part of the \"Cleveland experience.\""}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is one of my very favorite restaurants on the whole planet. Really, the only problem here is the line. No matter when you go, prepare to wait. The line will be at the door if not outside. However, my deep distain for lines can never snub my giddy spirit when the time comes to chow down on some delectable cuisine. As you can imagine, it can be pretty hard to find a table as well. that's never a problem since their friendly staff always manages to find one more table just big enough for your group. I love going for their clam bake when they have it. You'll get what seems like enough food to feed an entire state for an extremely reasonable price. I also really enjoy the Pierogis, corned beef sandwiches, and chicken paprikash. All this amazing food, and they have Vernors to drink! I can't wait to come back and try some of their other delicious offerings!"}
{"text":"Comfort food done well in a cafeteria setting. It's a unique experience and worth the trip."}
{"text":"First of all, it will take you almost an hour to get here, especially if you take Euclid. It's worth it though. There's so much substance and culture just in my baby toe. I believe the same remains true here at Sokolowskis.

I saw a photograph with Jim Thome and only inches away another photograph with the owner of the restaurant . This kinda stuff makes your head spin. My favorite part of the lunch is when I couldn't pronounce perogie and all the gals in line laughed in my face.

There's a very nice value on the bread served with the plate as well as the rest of the butter. Relaxed environment."}
{"text":"It is a lot of pressure to only come here once - I would like to try everything!

We split 3 plates and I don't exactly remember - but I know I loved the schnitzel and the pierogies.

A table next to us got some kind of beef stew that looked incredible.

James Beard award winner - or so says the t-Shirt. I bought a t-shirt - but wish they had a better selection of colors and sizes, I wanted black long sleeve - but they only had red long-sleeve in my size - come on management - get it together! :)"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Don't think about it, just come here. When visiting Cleveland, I definitely wanted to get some authentic eastern European food and I don't think I could have made a better choice. Be careful of the hours because it's a lunch spot on the weekdays and a dinner spot on the weekends. We came for lunch, and it was a fun cafeteria style set-up. We definitely over-indulged by splitting chicken paprikash and stuffed cabbage, both of which come with sides. But then we added 12 pierogis. It was excess, but #NoRegrets. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it all was. Just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been wanted to check this place out for about 5 years but have never quite been able to convince The Wife to come with me.  I went the other day with my little girl.  It is not hard to find and there is an awesome view of the industrial side of the city right near the parking lot.

I ordered the stuffed cabbage (a dish we love to try whenever we can get it) with mashed potatoes and cabbage noodles.  The stuffed cabbage was huge, but surprisingly bland.  The tomato sauce which covered it and the mashed potatoes was really mild tasting.  I had to add salt to it which I literally NEVER do when I'm in a restaurant.  My daughter loved it.  Really think that the mashed potatoes should have been topped with gravy.  Cabbage noodles were ok- a little bit greasy but satisfying.

Brought pierogies home and they were delicious.  Probably the best pierogies I've had in a while.  If I ever go back, I'll just get the pierogies."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and so are the people who work there. Coming from a polish family this place made my grandma and I feel right at home. Stuffed cabbage, pirogies and much more! Yum yum"}
{"text":"I'd known about and been wanting to visit Sokolowski's for months, and dreams finally came true last weekend. We got there after 8pm on a Saturday night -- less than an hour from the dining room's closing time -- and there was absolutely no line, so perhaps arriving late is the way to avoid the crowds. I love the down-to-earth, cafeteria-style setup -- that you can mix-and-match and get exactly what you want on your plate. We got a plate of stuffed cabbages and pirogis to share, with a beer, and it was just right. Dinner for two for under 20 bucks in a cozy, unpretentious dining room packed with old paraphernalia and happy chatting patrons -- you can't really go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland institution - kitschy at its finest.  Come hungry, leave happy.   Going through the cafeteria line, be sure to try the pierogies as a side dish.  When ordering an entree, you get two sides and they will allow you to pick pierogies for both.  My favorite entree is the chicken Paprikash.  It's hard to go wrong, though."}
{"text":"PIEROGI HEAVEN!  

This Polish restaurant is top notch!  I am a sucker for the stuffed cabbage and mashed potatoes and of course pierogies. The portions are huge and nothing short of amazing. The family who owns and runs this restaurant are some of the most thoughtful and fun people you will ever have the chance to meet.  

This place is without a doubt one of my favorite places to go when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place was good but I wouldn't say it's the \"best place I ever ate\" there is always a line and food is served lunch line style. Chicken paprikcash was pretty good. Have to try it in Cleveland but not somewhere I would go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We had pierogis, cabbage and the bradwurst, all were fabulous.
The door line is a bit confusing if you are going for the first time, since you have to pick your food first before taking a seat."}
{"text":"I've previously knocked them down a star for having crappy hours but every time I've eaten here it has been wonderful... The chicken paprikash, the stuffed cabbage, the meatloaf... It's all delicious. Oh, and the dessert... Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was truly impressive. My father told me I had to try it and since we were in the area we decided to go. I got there early on a Friday afternoon about 25 minutes before they opened. Shortly after arriving the line became huge (My father and I were the second group). They serve the food almost like a school cafeteria. I figured I had to try the pierogies and kielbasi which came with sides. The portions were generous and the food was absolutely delicious. The kielbasi was soft, tender, and full of flavor. 

If you are in the Cleveland area and you don't mind large crowds, then you must make time to go here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the portions are huge! Pierogues are to die for! Definitely a place to visit when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What an experience! Finding a place like this is so hard nowadays. The wait in line can be long but it is so worth it!  Love the food and dessert!  Been there several times and always have the chicken paprikash.  Don't miss out on this place, if you have a chance to go."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's weird walking through the lunch line like grade school but the food was really good. I really enjoyed the pierogies and liked that I was able to see the food and pick out what I wanted when I came up to it. There was a ridiculous line when I went at 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday but you can drink in line so that made it fun. I really enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"With Cleveland being such an up and coming, trendy, foodie town, Sokolowski's provides a delicious glimpse into a rich polish heritage. 

Established in 1923, it's one of Cleveland's oldest family run restaurants (Sokolowki family). The University Inn is a favorite of locals as well as the many famous customers they've had through the years, including a few POTUS. My first time there I thought the pictures, nicknacks and polish music were a little tacky, but by the time I left, I really appreciated the tradition that is celebrated here. 

... and the food. WOW!
Served cafeteria style, I wish I had a word beyond delicious. Everything is homemade with no concern for calories or cholesterol. Stuffed Cabbage that was seasoned perfectly, mashed potatoes with a thin, onion/cabbage gravy, and a side of cheese pierogi (2), was the perfect lunch today. 

On the edge of the revitalized and trendy Tremont neighborhood, when in Cleveland you really have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a break from chain restaurants and all their plastic cheerfulness, try Sokolowski's - which is authentic as it gets.  

It serves cafeteria food - but don't let that dissuade you, because if your middle school served what Sokolowski's did, you'd put on a hoodie and try to sneak back even now.  Every item of food on the line is handmade (right down to the root beer and the cream pies), served in a place that's comfortingly dark without being dank.  

This is THE place for comfort food.  Get your tray and wander down the line, folks.  

It looks, as others have noted, like your grandparents' basement, complete with an abundance of sports memorabilia on the walls, hand-drawn pictures from relatives, and portraits of the owners.  The heavy wooden tables are scarred but infinitely comfortable.  

The folks there are unfailingly friendly - I've been twice but they greeted me with a please hello every time, giving me suggestions and handing me free pierogies when they discovered it was my first time.   

The food?  Well, it's pure starch and meat.  The potatoes are hand-made, the corn is great, and every day they have honkin' meaty specials from salisbury steak to a rich, moist Yankee pot roast.  They have sausages of all sorts, and damn good sauerkraut.  I wouldn't trust the green beans, which looked overcooked to the point of being soggy.... But you're not here to eat healthy, goddammit.  

The food is what they call stick-to-your-ribs meals, and you'll like it if you're in the mood.   For that, it's five stars.  If you're in the mood for lighter fare, or you have a vegetarian in your party, you're out of luck.  

But you know, then you shouldn't be eating there."}
{"text":"Decided to try Polish food for the first time and really loved this place! I had my first pierogis here and it was DELISH! Also had the kielbasa which was great as well. I am used to sour sauerkraut so I wasn't prepared for how bland this style was, but it was kind of nice considering everything else was packed with flavor.

We went in for lunch around 11:45 and it was pretty empty, but by the time we left there was a long line. Don't be put off by the \"cafeteria\" aspect of this place - it was much nicer than a cafeteria! The seating and interior was much nicer  than we expected and there was a guy playing piano music... I kind of felt a little fancy even? TBH completely out of the realm of what I expected out of this casual joint! It's a super cute place with good cheap food and huge portions - how can I say no?"}
{"text":"I LOVE Sokolowski's. I moved to Cleveland 2 years ago and it is the best restaurant I've been to. Luckily I went with someone who has been there before so we knew to get there early even before it opens. I keep wanting to take people that visit me there but the timing never works out.  You really get a family feel and I liked the cafeteria style setup so you can see the food you're getting. The pierogies are amazing and you get a lot of food for your money. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I am obviously very homesick, but when I think of Cleveland, Sokolowski's is one of the first places that I think of when I think of home. Ironically, I didn't actually eat at this place until 2011, after my mom tried to convince me that I had in fact been here (I hadn't). The three times that I have been here, we (my mother, grandma, husband and myself) arrive before the doors open and for good reason! The pierogies are to die for, and I can't find anything that even comes close to them in North Carolina. Truly a Cleveland gem that I suggest everyone try!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. It is one of my grandmas favorites so my family took her and my grandpa here for her birthday. I called a few weeks ahead to get a reservation and asked for a table in the \"piano room\" per my grandmas request. 

It is cafeteria style when you first arrive, as you go through a line and choose your entree and sides as well as dessert, then you head with your tray to your table. We were seated against the back wall at a nice long bench-style table to accommodate our larger group. There was a gentleman playing the piano and he seemed to remember my grandparents, as he started playing my grandmas favorite song, \"New York, New York,\" which she requests every time they're there. I know she enjoyed that. 

As for the food, the servings are huge and the food is very authentic and delicious. Make sure to get dessert as it was amazing as well!

Definitely a different dining experience than what I'm used to but would return."}
{"text":"The food here is so good!! I love the perogies. The fish fry is the best in Cleveland. Don't even get me started on the dessert. The restaurant is so cool! Definitely old school. Try it and you'll thank me. You'll say next time can I gave another!"}
{"text":"We first learned of it by watching Anthony Bourdain on TV eat there. We knew we had to try it.  Amazing food. Such a classic place. Authentic Polish meals that are just delicious.  They post the menu up front. Then you walk to a counter and select what you want. For entrees they plate it for you. Don't forget to grab a fresh roll at the end. They will even help carry it to your table if you need it.  Open for lunch during week and select evenings for dinner (check ahead but I think it is Fri and Sat only). Check out the interesting assortment of nostalgia pictures on the wall."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is a Cleveland institution and a must visit for any out of towner wanting to get a feel for the kind of food and people Cleveland was built on. I love bringing visiting friends and family here, and they in turn love me for brining to enjoy all this awesome home-style food! 

The restaurant is cafeteria-style and newcomers might be a little overwhelmed by all the delicious sights and smells. Pierogi are a must-have, but otherwise my favorites are the paprikash and schnitzel. That being said, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose! A friend recently ordered the perch dinner and said it was some of the best she's ever had. All meals also come with roll and salad bar, and beer is available for those who want it. 

If you're looking for good, authentic Polish food and are in the area, Sokolowski's should be your first stop!"}
{"text":"So, believe it or not, after being a Clevelander for many years, until today, I'd NOT been to Sokolowski's...

Thank God and Luck that I did, cause now I'm a fan:)

My wife and I won some free gift certificates to Sokolowski's University Inn from a raffle (Thank you Lottery League:), and we stopped by for lunch. 

Sokolowski's is not so much located as stashed on University Road in Tremont. The amusing thing was that, on our trip, the directions were off but AMPLE road signage helped us wend our way to this little gem of a place. 

Firstly, and obviously, the food; plentiful, not too expensive, traditional hand-made polish/american cuisine. Awesome pierogies, pulled pork sandwiches, kraut, Kielbasa, desserts aplenty, with old fashioned sides like corn, beans, etc. It's all served cafeteria style. You get a tray and start (happily) with desserts, and then move your way to where you can be served a variety of great food. They also have a large, well stocked bar for libations, and their food line serves many fountain and bottled drinks. 


The atmosphere; the place is FULL of history. Autographed pics of celebrities, both local and national, sports heroes and various pieces of memorabilia cover the walls. You will not lack for anything interesting to look at. They even have a room reminiscent of an old Catskills resort complete with a very fine gent playing piano!  


Also, have to say, the people were really nice. We were taken care of quickly and pleasantly, even though they were BUSY. 

One odd point is their hours; they're only open Monday thru Friday, 11-3 pm, and their dinner hours are Friday, 5 to 9 pm, Saturday, 4 to 9pm. Their parking is decent, but I've heard it fills up quick, (I can see why:)

So, if you need a break from chains, but don't want to break your wallet and you're REALLY hungry for both food and pleasant atmosphere, Sokolowski's is a hidden treasure worth searching for..."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is a true Cleveland institution-and my family and I enjoy going whenever possible. The portions are nicely sized, beer selection is varied, and the atmosphere friendly. I love that the piano player greets us each time by playing my grandma's favorite song. I must go back soon for a dessert with my meal-those are so attractive at the start of the line!"}
{"text":"Major food coma alert! Good price for the amount of food they give you. The food is so hearty and rich it gives you the happiest food baby and puts you to sleep right away. Definitely agree on the other reviews, get the pierogies! I think this is the best pierogies I've ever had. 

I am a history nerd so I really loved the old-school decor of the place. The walls are full of old photos of Cleveland, the family history of the restaurant, and other old school collections that makes the place cozy, and they make waiting in line so much more fun."}
{"text":"We had an incredible meal at Sokolowski's. The entire staff was so helpful and the pride they take in their food (which is aaaaammmmmaaaazing) really shows. The selection of food is great, just make sure you get some pierogies.  The person behind us ordered the Pierogie dinner with two sides of pierogies. : )  We were stuffed beyond belief. Portions are very generous. This will ALWAYS be a stop for us when we are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First time at a Polish restaurant. The atmosphere here is great and you pick your food cafeteria style. Everyone in my party was happy with their meal. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style. Here's the bad: there was no bartender almost the whole time we sat at the bar. The positive:  the view is kinda awesome ( bridge and city skyline), the beer was cold and delicious. The Salisbury steak and perogies were phenomenonal. Wow!  Would go back here in a heart beat. Btw, talked to the locals at the bar for an hour what a blast."}
{"text":"I'm a Phoenix local and when in Cleveland.... you have to stop in this authentic Polish restaurant!!! The pierogis are like nothing you've ever had. All the food is incredible, actually. Good ol' comfort food. And the atmosphere is undeniably unique. Homey feel, live music, and tons of sports and celebrity memorabilia. Not to mention the staff was incredibly polite, patient, and friendly!! \"Midwest nice\" is real! Don't miss out on Sokolowski's!!!"}
{"text":"They have good hearty food but the selections are limited.  Very crowded.  Parking is limited you will need to use street parking."}
{"text":"SPECIAL NOTE: DO NOT EAT DINNER, BREAKFAST OR ANY OTHER MEAL BEFORE ENTERING THIS FOOD ESTABLISHMENT. ALSO- DO NOT BOTHER TO BUY FOOD FOR ANY MEAL AFTERWARDS (for atleast a few days). 

You will never, in your ENTIRE LIFE, feel as full as when you leave this cafe style Inn.  You will feel stomach in places that you didn't even know STOMACH exsited.  But its not a bad feeling. Its the feeling of home and GOOD REAL cooking. They don't cut back on anything. 

My boss took me here my first week of work to welcome me to a new city and a new job. He is 100% polish and so are all of the family workers that have ever worked here. They have run it for GENERATIONS and use the exact same recipes that the polacks used when they first came to america. They have a good reader on their website about the history/food:
http://www.sokolowskis.com/

The best food in the world, but only when you have the capasity to hold it. mashed potatoes, perogies, fried fish, stuffed cabbage, and more. All the exact, traditional food of Poland. Its amazing. I lived in pittsburgh, near polish hill, and they have some amzing perogies here in cleveland, and THIS is the PLACE to get them. And the gravy. AMAZING. AMAZING. the fish- AMAZING. there is NO bad choice. 

The only downside: they are only open for lunch on weekdays (no dinners), Only open for dinner on friday and saturday. So either go for lunch (early) or take a date. Just plan ahead because MOST of cleveland knows its here and its busy by 12 noon (LONG WAIT). So go early. I mean that. 

More Upside: The environment of the rest. is amazing. lots of old photos, the LARGEST BOBBLE HEAD collection i have EVER seen, and so much to look at. And they have a live piano player there all the time.  

THIS PLACE IS AN INDULGENCE ALL in itself. Its one of my absolute favorites here in cleveland."}
{"text":"This may have been one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Every single person we interested with was incredibly, genuinely kind. Our food was absolutely everything I was hoping for. So delicious. The prices we're unbelievable. The bar was wonderful. The staff was what really did it for me. Mike and Kevin where so welcoming and engaging. I left feeling full, happy, and enthusiastic to visit them over and over again."}
{"text":"What can I say about fall apart deliciousness of stuffed cabbage, macaroni & cheese and true old fashioned rice pudding...thank god I came with someone as I needed \"help\" trying to eat it all! Delish! Will definitely be back. 

Cute decor, focus and attention on the food & Sprecher Root Beer - I can see why this is a Cleveland favorite."}
{"text":"Yum, comfort food.

I went with some friends for dinner here. I got the kielbasa with sides of pierogies (50c extra) and corn on the cob. It comes with a garlic roll and unlimited trips to the salad bar.Well worth the $11-something I spent here.

I loved the kielbasa! I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I had fresh, homemade kielbasa but it was appropriately salty (compared to the packaged ones at the store which are almost always too salty for me), had a nice bite to the outside and was moist. My corn on the cob was actually a whole corn! A lot of places cheap out by giving you canned/frozen corn or half a corn on the cob, but this one was the whole thing. And it was moist and flavorful. The garlic roll was fluffy, and the pasta and potato salads were tasty as well.

My only criticisms were that one of my pierogies may have been sitting out for a while and developed a bit of a crust on the bottom so it was not as pleasant to chew on, and the lettuce was too \"wet\" so my dressing didn't quite hold on my salad. I mean, I guess if anything, this means they wash their produce?

My friends got heavier dishes (or they just don't eat as much) so they took a lot home. I'm a little jealous they get to eat more later by reheating at home while I actually have to drive there for more.

Will come back."}
{"text":"One of the guys from our plant here in Cleveland took me for lunch here. Wow, what a meal. Not overly great food but real good and LOTS of it. My best friend when I was in High School was Polish. That's one thing I remember about eating at his Grammas house, you could never see the plate under all the food. I had the liver and onions, I really enjoyed it. Someone above mentioned the piano man. He was good but if you want to talk to your dining partner, then don't sit too close to the piano. Cause he plays loud. I am delighted to find this little gem of a place. Its within a couple minutes of our plant. I will eat here every time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand why this is a Cleveland institution. There is just so much history to this place. Coming here is definitely both about the food and the ambience. Waiting in line (it was a huge line, so be prepared to stand for a while), you could see all the signatures and pictures of famous people that have visited (Bill Clinton!!). It takes a while to get to the front of the line but I felt it was well worth the wait. 

I read the warnings from previous yelpers about the hazard of getting too much food, but my boyfriend and I both got desserts, an entree and the salad. It was definitely more food than I thought I should be able to consume. We spent almost 40 dollars on our food, but given the quantity, I think it was an okay price.

The perogies were super delicious, but if you're on a diet, be careful. They're literally swimming in a pool of butter. The dough though is perfect with a slight chew. I got a dozen and still had half left to take home. The stuffed cabage was also really good. The meat and rice were well seasoned, but the sauce did come off a little sweet for my taste. 

Overall, great dining experience. If you've never been, you should definitely at least give yourself a taste of this Cleveland institution. It'll be something you won't regret."}
{"text":"The chicken paprikash is one of my favorite meals of all time. I dream about it the night before I go to Sokolowski's, and I'm salivating just thinking about it right now. No-frills cafeteria-style restaurant, but the food is amazing and the people who work there are always nice. One of my favorite spots to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portion sizes are maybe too much (though I don't think anyone minds). Me and my two friends went here on a Saturday night one hour until close, the line was long but it was worth it. They have many desserts to choose from and I suggest to try at least one, hey there's always room for dessert. We then decided to get two entrees and an appetizer to split. We wanted to do the meatloaf and stuffed cabbage for our entrees but they were out of cabbage. Instead after seeing how big the meatloaf was I decided to get 5 pierogies which ended up coming with two sides. In all I tried the: meatloaf, pierogies, saurkrat, green beans, potato pancake, mussels, rolls, and carrot cake. Everything and I mean everything was incredible. My friend is Polish and his grandmother used to cook for him and his family when they were younger, but he even agreed that this was better than his grandma's cooking. With every entree you get two sides, a roll, and the salad bar. The workers and people are very nice and the atmosphere is very unique. You get a great view of the city as well. It was one of the most memorable meals I've had and I recommend it to anyone in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"You just cannot go wrong with this Cleveland icon.  Sometimes the lines are insane at lunch time but it's worth the wait.  Salisbury Steak better than you mom ever made!!!"}
{"text":"How did this place only have one review?  If you're a Clevelander and you haven't been here, you have no idea what you're doing.  It's just a part of our history, it feels like Cleveland when you're here.  Tim knows what's up... good review.  Heavy food that tastes like it's from grandma's kitchen, you'll leave stuffed.  Plan on waiting in line on the weekend for dinner."}
{"text":"Ahhh...the Cleveland landmark restaurant everyone always raves about and is notorious for its long lines, huge portions, and cafeteria style eat and seat in what looks like a \"Stada Baba's\" (as my polish Grandmother would say) house. 

I've been here twice, and it's usually by request of others' plans that I'm dragged along to this place. It's not that I hate the place, but I just don't find any pleasurable dinner starting off with a 50 minute (yes, I timed it) wait in a compact line most likely starving, then pay an outrageous price for an outrageous portion of bland European/American food. Yes, it's hearty. Yes, it's comfort food. Yes, some of it is pretty good.

Perogies are good, but not extraordinary. Lasagna was delicious with plenty of ricotta and beef. 
Every review about the sauerkraut being salty, bland slop is true. It lacked the bite that I usually crave in this dish.
Meatloaf and Ribs according to BF were a good choice. 
Coconut cream pie was fantastic. 

Tips: Don't come with extremely high expectations, have a tall polish beer to help lessen the blow of waiting in line, come hungry and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been travelling near Cleveland to see family for almost 25 years now.  I'm so sad it took me this long to learn about Sokolowski's.   I love restaurants that offer their own culture.  Sokolowski's has history, culture, nostalgia and walls filled with signed pics of many famous people that have travelled there just to experience it all.  And then, there's also the most amazing food.  You will not leave hungry.  Comfort food.  This time, they didn't have the Chicken Paprikash (which I absolutely LOVED last time!) so went for schnitzel. It was very good, but  I wish I'd asked for gravy.  Didn't want to fight the huge line to go back and get it.   I don't even like perogies elsewhere, but can't get enough of theirs, which are  bathed in onion/butter sauce.   Don't come here to cut calories!  Hubby had a huge cabbage roll.  They also have bit sandwich selection that look popular amongst other diners, but I can't get away from ordering the home-cooked entrees!     Will recommend it to all my friends too.  For St. Louis fans, I think this is the Ted Drewe's of Cleveland.   Once you've had it, you gotta go back anytime you're back in town.   It's an experience in itself that you can only get there!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I want to take a nap afterwards.

The food is so deliciously rich and comforting. It's a Cleveland staple, the decor is complete with old school photos and knickknacks on the wall. Of the food, I think my favorite has to be the pierogies! The meat isn't so bad either, but the pierogies are what keeps me coming back. 

Go during the peak times for hotter food."}
{"text":"If you have never been to Sokolowski's before and you're around Cleveland, you need to give it a try. Given that you like polish food of course. The best thing about this restaurant is the different style the food is served. Once you go in, there's no seating but rather you lineup, cafeteria style, and pick the different things you want.

We went on a Friday when they have a mussel special which was like the best deal ever. It was what seemed to be about a pound and half of mussels for around $8. Their other polish fare is also pretty appetizing but the thing that stands out is that you wont have to spend much money for a full to very full stomach.

The inside decor is a little bland, but at least on that Friday they had a pianist and the atmosphere is fun. Will definitely go again when I'm craving some sausage or kielbasa."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! Love the place! Polish food dosen't get any better unless it's your mom's!"}
{"text":"Went Tonite because I was craving. I've been going there my whole life. Today, I was very disappointed in my visit. 

First, the food was cold. My mixed veggies weren't warmed all the way through. My pierogies were sitting in fake bright yellow \"butter\" that tasted like oil. My chicken paprekash was ok but the spaetzels we're mushy. They seemed packaged. 

Then my bill was wrong. The girl charged me 16.97 for a 13.49 meal. When I questioned it, she dismissed me.

Also the bus boy took my tray before I was done paying. I don't want my food disappearing on me. Not cool. I want to see my food and don't want it sitting at a table unattended. 

Also I had specifically said I did not want to sit by a bathroom.  Guess where he put us anyways!!! Also not cool. 

When we were done, my friend needed a to go box.  The guy who brought it took her tray before she was even done packing it up.  And he shoved a plastic bag in her lap!!!!

Because I love the place and it's so nostalgic for me I will give it another chance sometime in the future.  But I certainly hope that the management works on fixing the customer service that was seen today."}
{"text":"Although born & raised in Cleveland somehow my 1st visit to this landmark occurred 26 years after I moved out of state. 
What a truly great & classic place to represent the delicious offerings of my hometown. 
I gravitate towards family run businesses not only to support them financially but because of their great charm & character.  Sokolowski's is loaded on both. It's a pretty big place yet frequently has a line out the door so be prepared. It's also a cafeteria style set up - a throwback for sure - but a great way to see the awesome choices you have. There's a variety of choices of Eastern European comfort foods - amazing periogis, cabbage & noodles, various meats & sides to choose from.   Additionally there's an old fashion salad bar with dinner. (That might just be there to make you think you have something healthy in your tray!) 
The charm is as palatable as the food with the walls covered in old photos of people from back in the 30's & 40's through modern times. 
Next time I'm hoping to go on a Friday as I'm sure it's a great fish fry spot. 
Go hungry & enjoy the food coma afterwards!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for lunch or dinner!  The line can be long but it does move quickly.  My favorite dish is a Salisbury steak with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.  My husband loves the kielbasi and we also like the chicken paprikash.  The soups are usually delicious and you can always get a side (or a full order!) of pierogies.  There are a ton of desserts to choose from but I've never tried any because I know I'd be too full after my meal!  The only dish we've tried that we don't like are the crab cakes but I think we should have known not to order something like that.  There is usually someone playing piano in one of the room and, in the winter, they have a roaring fire going in the massive fireplace in the other room.  A definite stop for any Cleveland visitor!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo much fun for me! It's cute, historic, charming...definitely a great place to go. 

It's cafeteria style, so you grab a plastic lunch tray and channel back to your inner elementary school self to stand in line and pick your goodies! 

I tried their Salisbury steak, which was amazing. A huge ball of meat served with two sides, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut... the meat was perfect , tender and full of flavor. The mashed potatoes were red potatoes which are my favorite, the sauerkraut was a bit watery for my taste but wasn't completely horrible. Paired my meal with a nice fountain soda and I was good to go. The other awesome thing is you can just leave your tray and keep it moving. 

My only gripe is the staff was a little confusing when it came to ordering, but they were super friendly and helpful. 

I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"When I think about this establishment, \"Cleveland Rocks!\" is playing in my head. I guess this place makes me think of somewhere Drew Carey would have gone in the Drew Carey show. Or maybe he has been to Sokolowski. Pretty sure he has. I hope he has.

So this place just feels like home-like Cleveland. The Cleveland I think of when I think of my hometown. Nothing fancy. Comfort food and nice friendly people. 

My boyfriend and I were visiting the area and I wanted to take him somewhere that had food of the area. To me, polish food and perogies makes me think of the area. Too bad Parma perogies doesn't exist anymore. When I yelped Polish food, this is one of the recommendations that came up. 

We came mid day and there were a lot of older people eating. Cleveland sports paraphernalia was everywhere. Go tribe and dawg pound. Yep, that's Cleveland. The loyal sports fans.

It was very chilly that day so the warm inside of that restaurant combined with the comfort food was perfect. While waiting in line, there was a couple behind us- Cleveland locals who were giving us recommendations of what to order. They also pointed out buildings as we looked out the window. Their friendliest just added to the great experience.

The paper menu didn't list everything that was actually in the cafeteria style line, so it was alittle confusing going up to order but the lady serving us was nice.  We ordered chicken Paprikash and Stuffed Cabbage.  For sides we got macaroni and cheese, green beans, perogies and mashed potatoes. The food was really good. Not overly salty or overcooked. Sitting in hotel pans, I thought it could get overcooked, but it seems like the food goes fast.

One of the employees saw us taking pictures of the food. Think we stood out as yelpers? He was very sweet and took our picture. We were so stuffed at the end of the meal. So don't expect this to be a light fare.

A great meal. If you are looking for Polish food and an authentic Cleveland experience, come here!"}
{"text":"This was high on our list of places to visit on our trip to Cleveland - I'm so glad we made the trip to check it out.

We had Saturday dinner but arrived very late so they were out of things.  We still had a few choices so I picked the pork chops and my friend had the lasagna.  Make sure you bring your appetite!  Both those items came with sides and salad bar as well.  We had a TON of food, some of which we took home.

Food quality was great and large portions - all the food tasted homemade.  Service was excellent as well, they were very friendly despite being busy.  They were also interested in our trip and very helpful with suggestions on visiting Cleveland.

Overall, I'm happy we got to experience this place.  It's a Cleveland institution - been operating for ages and very much worth a visit."}
{"text":"LEGIT COMFORT FOOD. would highly recommend this place if you just need that extra something from your food. menu is kind of confusing but it's diner style with all kinds of traditional polish food. legit pierogies!"}
{"text":"Used to go there a lot when I was a Kid...then moved in 1977 to no Ridgeville...well, I decided to go for the memories and boy did I get them, not much has chainged and that is awesome...a Cleveland landmark!... but disappointed as the Pierogies were blah and the canned corn had no spice or butter like, someone dumped a can of corn into a bowl and microwaved it...BUT MY WIFE got a Ruban and gave me half as it was HUGE....And very good so..maybe just a bad day..will try again soon!.."}
{"text":"This place truly lived up to its reputation.Wife & I went Monday after a doctor appointment. The place is cafeteria style and I didn't kno what to order so I settled on the stuffed cabbage it was the best best best I ever had and the silky mashed potatoes & rich Brown gravy, fantastic I also got 3 perogies. My wife ordered Salisbury steak with mac and cheese fantastic all for 24$ with 2 drinks. It was our 1st but won't be our last. Do yourself a favor and check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. We went right when they opened (well 20 min before) so we could be in front of the line. The food was excellent. The pierogis and meat loaf are everything-- and I don't even like meat loaf!

Come hungry so you don't miss the excellent desserts as well. A must stop for anyone visiting the Cleve. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that my green beans were cold, otherwise everything was perfect. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just excellent. The atmosphere. The ease of ordering. We came in with a bunch of folks from work and they gave us a couple free plates of pierogi's. Old fashion guy playing Sinatra on the piano. 

Get the stuffed cabbage... I know I know.. never try and sell a place with anything cabbage, but saying. It is good. It was the size of a soft ball but it was more like a meat cloud. Not heavy at all. Just an all around great place."}
{"text":"I don't know what else I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. This place is a Cleveland institution and rightfully so.  You feel like you're eating in your grandma's house.  I went with my mom and sister and we each got something different to try and share--salisbury steak, beef stroganoff, and stuffed cabbage with mac and cheese, a ridiculous amout of pierogi, green beans, and cabbage and noodles. They each got a piece of pie that they stated was delicious.

Everything is freshly made and is true home cooking.  The service is friendly and what you get for the price is more than reasonable. It's a must try..althought I've heard that lines can be out the door at peak times."}
{"text":"Got to the resteraunt right before the end of lunch. They were hands down the best pierogies . They melted in my mouth .This was well worth the trip from North Carolina to stop there."}
{"text":"So I was foursquare mayor of Soke's for a few days. *Overly triumphant cheer!* This is a regular pitstop for the guys at work after we finish a meeting etc. 

Think polish. Think family. Think cafeteria. Think the largest lunch you can get in Cleveland. 

The line can wrap around the entire restaurant during a busy lunch hour. But I've managed to stop in a few times where the food-counter line was completely empty. Food is homestyle american, eastern european favorites, and oozing with flavor. *Read Paulius' review below for a good overview of Soke's offerings. And as Rachel said below, it is a struggle to not stuff your face to the point of shedding buttery sweat bullets and slowly making your way to sit in the car and let things settle for a half hour or so. 

My go to meal at Soke's -- Cottage cheese salad or cuke salad, bread pudding, ginger ale, salisbury steak, corn, and potato pancakes. 

Yes. I put all of that inside of me. And you should to. Don't be afraid to load up your tray with the favorites of home and beyond. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really great pierogies. The dough is perfect. If I lived in Cleveland I'd be a regular. The portion sizes for the meals are huge and includes a salad bar. Prices are pretty good, about $12-15 per meal. In addition to the pierogies, our party had the Salisbury steak (really tender and tasty and the gravy was great), the stuffed cabbage (tasted like it was covered in marinara sauce), smoked kielbasa (pretty good but not the amazing), and the fried cod (it was ok but it was really greasy). As for sides, the mixed veggies, mashed potatoes, and Mac and cheese were really good. The cheese cake was spectacular (fluffy texture and not too rich). 

We got there at 7 and waited about 35-40 min in line but it was worth it since we didn't have anywhere to go. They have to-go plates if you can't finish the massive meals. 

Must try in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"First time here recently. Homey atmosphere. Large portions. Price very reasonable. Basic comfort food, like you mom or grandmother made. Good quality"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but will definitely be back. The stuffed cabbage is ENORMOUS, which is awesome because it's delicious. Plenty of seating. Not a lot of parking spots."}
{"text":"Before you go to Sokolowski's make sure you're hungry... actually, make sure you're starving. Fat and starving. 

I really love the cafeteria style thing they have going on. It's not like your high school cafeteria though because the food is actually good and you'll want to come back. They have a decent selection and you see everything... so you want everything. It's hard to choose. 

The portions are made for Andre the Giant. We had a table of four and it was tough to squeeze all of our plates onto the table. 

The pierogi are pretty much to die for. They have some really good sauerkraut as well. The stuffed cabbage was okay. I thought it was too big with too much meat but that's just me. We also ordered the steamed mussels as an appetizer. I'm not sure why you need appetizers at Sokolowski's. They were really good though. 

And because I'm extra tubby, I grabbed a piece of carrot cake for all of us to share. It was the best carrot cake ever. The four of us could not finish it because of the huge amount of food we had already eaten. 

On Friday and Saturday nights the piano man is there. We sat directly next to the piano. 

I'm already thinking about what I'll get on my next visit."}
{"text":"My wife had seen this restaurant showcased on Food Network and with a trip to Cleveland planned, we knew we had to try it. I'm so glad we did. I've heard of people talk about food that is prepared with love and that you can actually taste the difference. I thought I knew what that tasted like, but I was wrong until eating here. One bite of Sokolowski's and I felt like I was eating real food from a chef who wasn't preparing food for pretentious critics, but for their loved ones. I felt nurtured. I felt like someone was taking care of me. I felt like I was home and my mom (who has never cooked Polish food) had prepared this for me. I know it might be hard to believe, but you can actually taste the love in every bite. 

Here's what we had and why I now envy the people of Cleveland:

Pierogis. You won't regret this. Eat them. Love them. Then take some home cause you will crave them two hours later. 

Stuffed cabbage.  Large portion and undeniably good. Go ahead, unbuckle your pants. It's worth it. 

Pork chops. I never eat pork chops. They are dry and often just not prepared right. These however were THE BEST I have ever eaten. Moist, delicious, and unbelievably good. It had me asking my wife if these really were pork chops, cause I've never tasted them prepared this amazing before. 

Cleveland, you are some lucky, lucky people. If I were you I would easily be a regular here."}
{"text":"I waited 45 minutes in line on a Saturday night just as they opened at 400pm. The line must have been over an hour long by 500pm.  Food is good but not fantastic.

Not sure if I would wait in this line if I had a family and had anything else to do."}
{"text":"Okay it is a Polish Cafeteria ... okay but this is the Cleves ... so lighten up because it maybe, no it is, the best food since your Mother last cooked for you.  Bernie and his siblings make an extremely tasty spread of great old fashioned favorites like Stuffed Cabbage, Breaded Pork Chops, Meatloaf and a whole host of Mom's favorites ... along with the best Pierogi and Noodles and Cabbage in town.  Hearty, you bet, but you wouldn't leave hungry and you will come back.  Oh yes, the best part, homemade desserts of all kinds ... Apple Pie is amazing, Coconut Cream pie great ... you get the picture.  Classic Cleveland ... absolutely great."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place I had to try it. I've been here twice and both times received the worst customer service EVER. I don't care how amazing the food is, I've given it one too many chances.  I will never spend another dime at this establishment."}
{"text":"After hearing how fabulous the pierogi's were here, I had to make my way to try them for myself.  I was going with my parents, and they have very limited hours, only open lunch during the week and certain dinner hours on Friday and Saturday, so we got there just in time to make my parents happy that we are eating dinner early but they were open, but guess what... 5:15 PM on a Friday and they still weren't open.  A line started to form outside which was a bit obnoxious but I can let that slide. 

I was so surprised that when I walk in you actually order your food like you are at a cafeteria, grab a try, pick up dessert should you please, then tell the women what you want and she plates it for you.  

I ordered the stuffed cabbage with mac n cheese and pierogi's as my side (yes I'm a fatty), let me tell you their serving sides are huge!! I barely ate half my meal, but they do give you boxes to bring the rest home.  My stuffed cabbage was delicious, the meat was a little dry, but I wasn't disappointed and the mac n cheese was good.  But, as everyone said the pirogi's are life changing, fresh and delicious.  I would suggest making that your meal no matter what.  

Some of my other families got meatloaf, fried shrimp, cabbage and noodles, and the only thing they said they wouldn't order again was the meatloaf so be warned.  

I would totally go back again to eat for lunch, or grab something quick, but you just have to be prepared for the setting and know this is not right for every occasion."}
{"text":"We were visiting from San Diego and we love this place!! The service was excellent, we sat in the piano room. Very cool environment and the food was great. Especially the pierogies and the pastrami sandwich!!"}
{"text":"This is as close to homemade polish food that you can get in a restaurant. We went for my birthday dinner and I chose this place knowing my parents would enjoy it. It is served cafeteria style and the portions are hefty. The prices are great. They serve soft drinks, beer and have a bar. The flavor of the food is spot on and you will be full in no time. I highly recommend this restaurant. The only down side is that their serving hours are fairly short so try to get there early. There is ample parking across the street which is great for Tremont!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. the workers and owner I a gem. It's a cafeteria style. from stuffed cabbage, pork chops, and pierogis. Seriously the best food I had. awesome prices as well for the amount of you get."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Great selection cafeteria style.Generous portions of well prepared items.. The place is usually mobbed.Can highly recommend. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good.  Took a group of clients here for lunch and everyone loved the food!  The little old ladies behind the counter serving you are an added bonus. This is a great comfort food restaurant and I will definitely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's was just ok for me.  I do think that as a native Clevelander, you have to visit this place at least once in your life, which I've done.  I was in the area on a Friday afternoon, and decided to stop here.  As others have mentioned its more of a no-nonsense, self service type of place.  Didn't quite know where to park or enter, but figured it out.  Same thing once I entered the building...do I go left/right etc.  I found my way to the line for food and grabbed a tray, the silverware was somewhat hidden, so I missed it, the first time and had to pardon my way back thru the line to retrieve.  Anyway, I bypassed the desserts, which are displayed first.  I then proceeded to the soft drink station for an iced tea.  Now to the actual food.  I opted for the stuffed cabbage which was not visible on the steam table, I saw the person in front of me order it and the server produced it from behind the counter.   On a side note, couldn't find a menu nor pricing, so had no idea what was being offered and how much it cost.   The server mentioned that I get 2 sides.  I opted for corn and vegetable medley.  I just couldn't will myself to get mashed potatoes or pierogis with the massive cabbage roll.  I was given a plate for the salad bar.  Another side note....had no idea where the salad bar was located.  Also grabbed a roll from the shelf above the steam table.  I proceeded to check-out and my total was $17+, which I thought was a little bit pricey, but oh well, too late.  I lifted my tray and proceeded to find a seat.  In looking for a seat, I did see the salad bar, not much to choose from, so I just got some mixed fruit, which was a combination of fresh and canned fruit.  Once I was finally seated, I proceeded to taste the food.  The cabbage roll was big, but wasn't hot in the middle, of the roll.  The veggies were ok.   Overall, I'm glad that I finally had a chance to try this restaurant, but not sure that I would return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place my dad brings me here whenever he can. The perogies are to die for."}
{"text":"I normally write really long reviews. But plain and simple, this is the best place on earth."}
{"text":"One of a kind! This curious intersection of American and Polish history is bound to confuse any first-timer. At first glance, it looks like the parking lot is only adequate for about 10 cars, two of those being handicapped spaces. But around the back, there's another large parking area. First obstacle - done. 

The people eating quietly on the covered patio kept their mouths tightly shut and gave away no secrets as to what we were in store for as they chewed. Suddenly, a large circular T-shirt cart enters your peripheral vision and you wonder if you're in the right place. People squeeze by with trays of food and finally you notice the long cafeteria-style counter. There are old sepia photos and knick-knacks everywhere. Where am I? Can I get a map?

An employee notices you look lost and cheerily offers to help. Take out or eat in, one entrees and two sides (the standard order, at least). Literally EVERYTHING was new to me so it was a struggle to decide (obstacle #2), but the Chicken Paprikash had \"tomato cream sauce, tender boneless chicken, spaetzle\" with a wonderful mix of spices and I was sold. The side order of Pierogies is two pieces, and a not-so-little bowl of Sweet (Mashed) Potatoes came with some white crust on top that I later discovered to be roasted marshmallow. My dad followed up with the ENORMOUS Stuffed Cabbage, more Pierogies, and Mac n' Cheese. Our total, including one pint glass of Polish beer, came out to be around $35. I do wish that the prices for entrees were delineated a little more clearly since we didn't realize they all had different prices. 

We grabbed some bread rolls, butter and sour cream, and after paying a waiter whisked away my tray to a table. This is where my second point of contention comes in, because the waiter seated us right next to the door to the women's bathroom - my chair was barraged intermittently by people scurrying to the toilet. In a restaurant with so many seating options (in many, many rooms), is it really so hard to find a better spot for two people? (Note: we went relatively early on a Friday evening, with no wait and plenty of open seats left.)

I don't know why they even bother with the salad bar since the portions are so large, but it's a nice counter-balance to the heaviness (do not come while attempting to diet) of the food, and hey, it's free! The selection includes fruit, potato, and macaroni salads, as well as the traditional customizable options with an array of dressings. 

We finished everything. Yes, everything - because it would be a crime not to. We tried to take our time, but it just wasn't happening. Except for the Mac n' Cheese, this food was winning. We were both hugely satisfied with our entree choices, I loved the Pierogies (although my dad was confused as to why these dumpling-cousins seemed hollow; they actually have a simple potato and cheese filling), and I forced down the Sweet Potato even when it became too sweet to bear (obstacle #3). We had reached our limit when my dad decided to take a bite of the roll just for the heck of it, exclaimed \"It's good!\" in surprise, and the next thing I knew I was downing that crisp, onion-y bread also. Probably the most evil, conniving roll in existence for looking so plain but tasting so good. 

So of course I had to see what was so great about this place that women kept banging into my chair to reach. The offending door actually leads into another corridor with piles of stuff heaped around, then another door that contains the real prize. I was half afraid the woman shaking the door while I was using the toilet was going to break it open, but miraculously the flimsy lock held. My stomach wasn't completely ready for the culture shock I put it through at Sokolowski's, but I have no regrets and would relive the experience (minus the awkward table) over again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you think might let you down, mostly because it's on the \"to do\" list in CLE, and then doesn't.  Sokolowski's (University Inn) serves up both Polish food and American food featuring both a Polish and comfort food spin.  It is the first Polish restaurant that comes to people's minds here, while there are a few others that aren't as well known.  Not only that, it is the oldest family owned and operated restaurant in this city, now being operated by the third generation.

Sokolowski's is the furthest thing from fine dining.  It's more like a cafeteria.  You might need those behind the counter to identify some things for you, mostly to be sure, and they are glad to do so as they are very down to earth.  The restaurant is fairly large, having different rooms that people can rent out for parties or similar functions.  Most of it is dimly lit except for the bar, which has large windows that look back to downtown from atop a bluff next to the Cuyahoga River.

I had a small Polish themed Salisbury steak, potatoes with an excellent sauce, and some pierogies on the side.  Everything was very good and, since they are a unique item that one doesn't run into very often, the pierogies were the thing I remember most.  It's a good thing that it's a cafeteria and not a buffet because, had it been a buffet, I would have gone back for a \"few\" more of their pierogies.  If you don't believe me, check out their food photos on their website and then remember to pull your tongue back into your mouth.

The prices at Sokolowki's are reasonable.  The noise level is somewhat lower in the restaurant while higher in the bar, where you'd think it's sort of a \"Cheers\" type of place with its regulars.  There is parking both on site and on the street.  One can also take the RTA Red Line to the Ohio City station and walk here if they wanted to, though that could be a slight schlep.  There are a few other things to note.  First, while pierogies are shown on the menu as a main, they can also be had as a side item, meaning you'll get fewer of them.  Then, the menu changes, with Friday and Saturday having slightly different offerings and possibly even different hours than Monday through Thursday, while they are altogether closed on Sunday.  Lastly, the Tremont area, along with Ohio City, is across the winding river from downtown and is being gentrified, though most of the hipsters and trendy types will be closer to Ohio City and the West Side Market.  Let them stay there because, while change is inevitable, Sokolowski's is one of those places you don't want to see change."}
{"text":"This was a good Bourdain tip - line out the door when we showed up at 8PM Friday, one hour before close. We were a little worried about getting food, but the line wrapping throughout the spacious tavern moved fairly quickly. I think we made it to the cafeteria counter in about 45 minutes? So many hearty Polish-American options, big slices of cake, and a salad bar. I got the stuffed cabbage, an enormous ball of seasoned succulent ground meat wrapped in leaves. Side order of pierogi is a little extra but worth it. I'm salivating just thinking about my big plate of food covered in red and brown gravy. They also do warm garlic rolls with every dinner and have lots of affordable drink options, alcoholic and non. A clear and delicious Cleveland institution!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been before and don't know what's going on its a little weird.  Its a cafeteria style restaurant where you choose your own seating.

The food was very good and the setting was interesting with cool stuff and the walls and a solid piano player."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday with my girlfriend. Food was terrible. place was loud and dark. I had Schnitzel and Pierogis. Nobody uses salt and pepper in kitchen. Schnitzel was dry, flavorless. Pierogis were steamed and tossed in butter. 

My girlfriend had Chix Papp, potato pancakes, pierogis. All was flavorless. I thought food was a rip off for the price. wont be back."}
{"text":"Came with friends from out of town who had this on their list of places to go. Having lived here for 5 years, I'd still never been, so we all tried it out together.

We waited in line for about 35 minutes, getting to know our line mates, who were happy to explain how everything worked. When we got to the food, the servers were also happy to answer our newbie questions, so everyone got exactly what they wanted. And the nice gentlemen at the register carried our trays to our table, so no one dropped any of our enormous servings of pierogie, galumki, cabbage & noodles and everything else we piled on our plates. 

There was live music in the dining room, great service at the bar and just a homey, 'dinner in our church hall' atmosphere that I really enjoyed. Our friends had a ball and I may just wander back when I need satisfy my galumpki fix."}
{"text":"Be sure to wear elastic waisted pants. And take time out for a nap after wards.

Being of Polish heritage, I am familiar with the gut-busting nature of Eastern European food. Not exactly the kind of place you would eat at before a night of drinking and partying ;)

That being said, Sokolowski's is solidly a great place for Polish comfort food.  The kielbasa, pierogies, kraut, salisbury steak, breaded pork chops and fried fish fillets are great. They've got real mashed potatoes and homemade gravy. Veggies are generally of the canned variety, but tasty nonetheless. The salad bar is a bit sparse, but they have creamed cucumbers, so it's all good in my book.

On my recent visit, I grabbed a slice of carrot cake to go. Oh my....soooo good.

Now if only I had a wheelbarrow for my gut."}
{"text":"4-stars for the service.
2-stars for the food.
avg--3-stars.

Sorry Sokolowski's, I went in with such high expectations based on all the hype.  Quite honestly, if it weren't for the hype, I wouldn't have tried it.

Found the selection to be so/so.  The food offerings were slaughtered with garlic and onions.  I'd love for chefs to take the challenge of flavor without onions one day, and really try to push their cooking talents to the next level.

My brother tried asking the first person behind the line how it works as this was our first visit.  Sadly, the music was so loud we could barely hear her.

The guy checking us out was in all the photos, he was super cool.  I asked how much a second roll was and he said just take it, later I came back for a refill and he said take that one too.  Of course, for $12, and cafeteria style, it should all be included.

I enjoyed my experience, food not so much, probably won't return.  But now at least I've been there."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place on our way out of town last Friday for lunch.  What hit me immediately was the smell when you walk in.  I'm half Polish and this place smelled EXACTLY like my grandmothers house when I was growing up.  It's all cafeteria style with the desserts up first.  Our group couldn't resist grabbing a piece of chocolate cream and coconut cream pie.  Between all of us we had the golobki, roast beef and pierogis with noodles and cabbage.  All of the food was tremendous and the portions are ridiculously huge.  We took over half our lunch home.  Simply put.....this place is pure AWESOME!   Stop by sometime and grab a bit....you won't leave hungry or leave disappointed."}
{"text":"You gotta want it - the lines are long!  Pierogis are divine but seriously - don't miss the rolls!  They look like nothing but taste like heaven!"}
{"text":"Okay, so full disclosure: I'm an actual Polish Girl *cue Neon Indian*... so that being said, there's potential for bias.

Alright, then.
 I loved the vibe of this place-- totally babcia's basement-chic with old yellowing photographs and memorabilia posted up on the walls. It's very old-Cleveland. This is the homey-feel that chains like TGIF's try to fabricate so garishly. 
We went on a Saturday evening and grabbed a beer from the bar and assumed our position in the sprawling line that wrapped around the restaurant. An older couple in front of us eagerly waited in line commenting they had driven all the way from Virginia to eat here.  Don't expect to get in-and-out of here quickly during peak hours-- it's all part of the experience. It's cafeteria style dining in the best way possible.  20 minutes later when I made my way to the smorgasbord I settled on pierogis and chicken paprikash... although I'm kicking myself now I didn't get a side of dumplings. I also tried some of my dining partner's red cabbage which was seriously so good and I think I would pick that over sauerkraut next time.  Also be sure to try the cucumber side at the salad bar.  The staff was friendly and accommodating but it's also pretty clear they run a tight ship.

So come here when you're looking for really good comfort food, some Cleveland nostalgia and aren't cutting for a bodybuilding competition.
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not only is this the oldest family owned and operated restaurant in Cleveland, but it is also one of the best, if not THE best. If you don't believe me, go to the restaurant and see all of the pictures of various famous chefs and celebrities who tout this place as THE place for traditional, delicious Polish food. Michael Symon, Jimmy Fallon, Anthony Bordain, Tyler Florence, Bill Clinton and many others agree with me. I must admit that when I walked into this restaurant for the first time, I was a little skeptical. After all, the setup is cafeteria style. So all the food is already prepared and you walk through a line and point at what you would like to eat. I wondered how good the food could be if everything is already prepared and sitting on a steam table. Well, shame on me for doubting this 92 year old establishment. I have tried the cabbage and noodles, pork schnitzel and last, but not least, their a-maz-ing pierogies. Everything that I've tried is phenomenal. I could sing praises about those pierogies for days. Don't be discouraged by ridiculously long lines in the winter. This place seats a LOT of people and by the time you get to the front of the line, a table will be available. Obviously, this restaurant knows exactly what they're doing. They've been around for decades and the extra long lines in the winter prove that this is the place to eat when you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Of course this place is a Cleveland institution, and yes, it's good, and yes, it's fun, and yes, I hope it's always here, and yes, it's in Tremont, and yes, it's right next to the cold storage facility, and yes, it's cool in that white socks with dress pants kinda way...BUT...I can't give it five stars because it's just not that great a value for your money. I'm not saying it's expensive--it's not. But every time I leave this place (usually so full I can't walk or think straight), I feel like I spent too much for what I got."}
{"text":"Best Polish restaurant I've ever been to. The counter service can be a bit confusing but the staff is friendly and can help answer any questions. Honestly there is nothing I've ordered that I wasn't pleased with. Even the non-Polish options are delicious. I wish I didn't live 5 hours away because I'd be here frequently, once a year will have to do!"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's University Inn is another of the many treasures in Cleveland. This is Old World Comfort Food at its finest."}
{"text":"Good homemade food. Large portions, enough to share. Liked the cafeteria style with no waiting when you go early."}
{"text":"Well what can you really say.  I'm sitting here, listening to beautiful piano being played 15 feet from me.  As I round 3rd base and lop up the rest of this very large meal, I can only assume I will be sitting here for a while to digest both my food and the wonderful ambience.

The meal; Weiner Schnitzel (veal), mashed potatoes (red), perogis, and stuffed cabbage w red sauce.

I got the veal and potatoes covered in a Salisbury gravy, each complimented each other: savory, hearty, and cooked to perfection. The perogis were perogis done right, with the perfect filling to noodle ratio, and that butter glaze that's missing when you try to make them yourself.  The stuffed cabbage was just  too much food, but what a mistake if I would have passed it up.  The red sauce was marvelous and authentic as you can get.

I'll leave this perfectly tuned opus of food, amosphere, and authenticity in a moment...full and happy.  But just one more song from that piano before I go.."}
{"text":"This was such a cute, down home place to sit down with family and have a great meal. I've only been here once when I came home to visit my cousin who lives in Tremont. He always takes us to some local place that is unique and good.


This place just made you feel like you were at a family members house. There was a little wait in line (which is always a hint that it's a good place to eat right??).  It was served Cafeteria style,and our food was very, very delicious. 

We all  had a great time and I would love to go back next time I'm home for a visit to Ohio. That's one thing I miss down here in Texas, is that good home cooked meal that isn't franchised. 

I'm a BIG fan of Mom & Pop places!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Cleveland, and you have not been to Sokolowskis, you had better turn around and go back.  This place is just awesome.

Not only do they serve traditional Polish faire in an atmosphere that shrieks local flavor, but the clientele is also local flavor!  There may be a line to get to the food, but you can count on having a nice conversation with the folks in front or behind you!

The cafeteria style seems a bit daunting, but they have very helpful servers who will help you find a table quickly once you arrive at the register.  The two times I have been, it seems like they have all their moms and pops behind the counter serving you with polite jabs about not eating enough, or some such.  I went with my wife and son both times, and I really enjoyed how their faces lit up when they found out he's named after a popular Polish Pope from the 20th century ;-).

Menu items for which I can vouch:
Pierogies
Potato pancakes
Kielbasa
Cabbage and Noodles
Green Beans
Sauer Kraut
Stuffed Cabbage
Black Cherry Cola"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know. A native Clevelander and I'm not slapping down five stars for Sokolowski's. How could I? I should be drawn and quartered, I should be run out of town on a rail. OK, before you pick up the pitchforks and lighting the torches, lemme get it all out.

First, if I were to rate the place on overall kitsch and Clevelandness I'd give the place four stars. Sokolowski's is an institution. It's more an experience than it is a just a restaurant. If you've never been here before you probably need a guide. There are no instructions, there are no clear signs telling you where to go. No hand-holding. You've gotta figure out which door to use to enter the place, you've gotta figure out that it's lunch lady land and you've gotta figure out what you want before you get up to the ladles and smiling ladies. Oh yeah, and you've gotta pick your dessert first. That I like.

The atmosphere is pure grandma's house. There's a little bar up front, pictures of celebrities both local and distant adorn the walls, religious edifices smattered about, plenty of Popes for everyone, and the picture just behind the piano player (yeah, a live piano player) is bazaar - it's an image of the restaurant surrounded by flying pterodactyls and a couple of cavemen. WTF? We sat in the back by the music man with twinkling sounds of old standards clinking from the keys and old dark wood furniture. Is that a floating door by the restrooms? I thought someone had slipped me mushrooms. Maybe it was the piano player. He reminded me of Abe Vigoda. The small salad bar was unkempt and nothing was labeled. Be adventurous, the potato salad is pretty tasty.

The food is exactly as everyone else has described. It's heavy on the Polish and produced en masse. There are plenty of ethnic standards like Hungarian goulash, chicken paprikash, kielbasa, cabbage and noodles, pierogi, along with some cafeteria staples like mashed potatoes, green beans, white fluff bread rolls and  salisbury steak. It's chaffing dish heaven without the hairnets. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Maybe that's how they did it in the old country.

I had the chicken paprikash and it was just OK. I found it to be way underseasoned, there weren't nearly enough spaetzel and the chicken, while plentiful, was tough and dry. I've had much better at Stampers and Der Braumeister. I think unsalted is the rule of this place because even the mashed potatoes were bland. The saving graces were the coconut cream pie and the pint of Acadia IPA I had to wash it all down.

I get it. Sokolowski's is a Cleveland icon. It's got character oozing out of every pore and it's even garnered some national attention (Bourdain liked it? Really?). But the food, meh. I used to eat lunch here quite a bit when I worked down on Scranton Rd back in the late 90s and it was just OK back then. I bet it hasn't changed since the place opened back in the 20s. It's cafeteria-style ethnic comfort food served in vintage Cleveland clothing. Big Chuck and Lil John would be proud. The portions are big but it's not that cheap. For my wife and I it was just under $40."}
{"text":"We sampled a little bit of everything from the pierogies (Very good) to the cabbage and noodles (bland), to salsbury steak (solid). Food is super homey, nothing that's going to impress the food snobs but comforting nonetheless. Great community vibe. They'll be around forever."}
{"text":"The carrot cake is heaven! Live piano player! Best fried fish I have ever eaten. Yes please!"}
{"text":"Large portions of Polish comfort food at a reasonable price. The staff knows how to wrangle the large crowd so the cafeteria style line moves at a good pace. I will return the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm Scotch/Irish, so I'm used to food that is as pasty white as we are and boiled until you can suck it through a straw. I never experienced the culinary orgasm that is Polish cuisine until I moved in with Russian/Polish room mates. 

It is best to show up before they open, even then there are people already waiting in their cars, salivating in anticipation. Some people line up outside the door despite the snow and wind. They got the shakes, they're Paprikash junkies. There is always a crowd but don't worry, being cafeteria style the line moves fast. They usually let you in early though if you want to sit at the bar (which has an AMAZING view of downtown) where you can drink yourself stupid with Great Lakes beer before binging on the starchy cheese drenched goodies that await you.

The decor is 1970's rec room. Plaid, wood paneling, bobble heads, and pictures of the pope are everywhere. Elvis Presley music is on rotate. If you grew up in Cleveland it is probably like eating in your own home only cleaner and everyone is wearing pants. 

This is not for the health conscience! Everything served is gooey, starchy, cheesy, potato stuffed, noodle laden, rare meat filled flavor explosions. The feeding line starts with desserts. That's right, the first actual food you see is a variety of pie slices. Each one is bigger than the elephant mans face. The mood at the salad bar is much the same. It starts with a glorious, mountainous, teetering pile of Parmesan cheese followed by a pint sized container of pesky lettuce. This is food done right. It is completely unapologetic. This unsafe level of butter and cheese is a Paula Deen fever induced wet dream. 

Sokolowski's is food heaven where each morbidly obese angel lounges on a cheesy warm Pierogi instead of a fluffy white cloud. You'll eat yourself into a diabetic coma. You'll eat until you hate yourself. You'll eat until you look and feel horribly disfigured. When $11 buys you a huge dinner, two sides, a roll, a drink, dessert, and a salad bar you can afford to."}
{"text":"The best!! Food,service,atmosphere..... all amazing. Always a great time and everyone always in a friendly mood. Been coming here for years to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, family gatherings or just dining with family or friends. Delicious assortment of foods and a full service bar to get a drink while waiting in the chow line. Truly a unique award-winning Cleveland landmark. None better. Try it!!"}
{"text":"I found this place a few years ago while looking for good eats in the Cleveland area. Upon arriving, I was surprised to see that this is a \"cafeteria\" styled restaurant. You arrive (usually there's a long line) and pick up a tray and fill it up as you go through the food line. Their selection varies weekly, but their staple meals such as meat loaf, stuff cabbage, brats, and perogies are always served. They sometimes have specials featuring catches from Lake Erie. The food line starts with dessert, but beware that you might order too much food if this is your first time. In addition, to the meal, you get 2 sides such as corn, green beans, mashed potatoes, etc, you also get a plate for unlimited salad at the salad bar (there's also fruit) and a dinner roll. Typically if I do get dessert, I end up packing my dinner home! There's also a good selection of beer at the bar. There is a small selection along the food line. The food line is quite nostalgic as it takes me back to the elementary school days. 

If you haven't tried polish food, I would recommend going with the basics like stuff cabbage and a side of perogies (you can get 2 perogies as your side for additional $0.50 towards any dinner). The portion of the stuff cabbage varies, but its more than enough. The rice and meats in the cabbage is cooked to perfection. It's very tender and basically melts in your mouth! The sauce has a good balance of flavor; both sweet and sour. Be sure to smother the stuff cabbage with the sauce. The perogies are very good as well, after all, it is one of Michael Symon's \"best thing I ever ate\". They are cooked in a butter sauce with a bits of onions for flavor. They can be served with sour cream if you chooses.

This is usually the place I bring visiting friends because of its uniqueness and the quality of the food. They all leave happy and would come back if they are in town again."}
{"text":"Love the cabbage rolls and cheese and potato pierogi.  You order at the counter and push a tray, which had me panicked the whole time - but the nice people who take your money have someone carry your tray for you.  The line moves pretty slow, but that is understandable, since everything looks so good, it's hard to choose.  Salisbury steak is good, but the homemade gravy on it absolutely makes that dish."}
{"text":"Cleveland Staple. Great place to try if you haven't. An old school experience. Great food, huge portions and nice people.  You have to try."}
{"text":"I have heard about Sokolowskis from a friend and saw it on the Foodnetwork, now I can finally say, it's amazing!!! I went on a Friday for lunch and had the Chicken Paprikash with pierogis and potato pancakes! Washed it down with a tasty IPA at the bar and finished the meal with a giant slice of German chocolate cake.  I live in Michigan and already want to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pierogies. Next time, I going for the prime rib with a side of pierogies. Their portions are enormous. Save room for their delicious pies."}
{"text":"There's good reason this place has so many reviews and it's nearly a 5 star restaurant. Most of the food is superb. It's an easy, quick moving line. It's fun and casual and an old time favorite of Cleveland. I'm only sorry I didn't grow up going here and just recently learned what a true treasure we have for great, ethnic food."}
{"text":"Fantastic hearty Polish eats with a great atmosphere to match.

On Friday and Saturday  nights a surprising joyful line greats you as you enter an unapologetic celebration of Poland and Cleveland. The line mercifully snakes by a full bar where Polish beers Stawski and OK are on draft. The walls are filled with chotskies that chronical Cleveland history and celebrity. The reason for the celebration is the food; pefectly fried porogies with butter carmalized onions, homemade mac and cheese, crispy fried fresh fish, mothers meatloaf, chicken paprikash, kielbasa, sauerkraut, and more. Come hungry because the portions are meant for two."}
{"text":"I have walked along the beach in Waikiki but I prefer walking the cafeteria line at Sokolowski's. I had tea at the British Embassy in Washington, DC but I prefer a table at Sokolowski's. This restaurant is like a never ending Polish wedding. Friends and relatives of all ages come here. While waiting in line people talk with you and the wait time flies by. 

This is just a happy place. There is food and music and laughter. Make no mistake this is not nostalgic, or retro, or a place of memories. Sokolowski's lives in the now serving food that has always been the norm in Cleveland not a thing of the past. And to all of you who say it reminds you of your grandmother's basement, I envy you. My granny never had a president in her basement nor had she earned any recognitions nor been on national television. 

The food as many reviewers stated is the food of our city. Sokolowski's happens to do it larger than anyplace else. You know exactly what everything is. No need for a paragraph description for each item. The stuffed cabbage is bigger than your fist, the pierogies swim in a lake of butter and onions, and the sausages scream of garlic and smoke. The salad bar has beets and horse radish and cucumbers in sour cream. As good as any wedding where the aunts bring platters of their particular specialties. Better than going to a wedding because you get off a lot cheaper than a wedding gift costs. 

The last time I was there one of my friends had a house guest from London who joined us for dinner. He took so much food a busboy had to carry a second tray. When we left he said he felt like he was leaving a party and no place in London compares for food and price and fun. That said a lot as Londoners are like those from San Francisco. They think everything about their cities is the best and never stop telling you. 

I have seen the Sokolowski family on television. They take great pride in what they do. Some cooks say they cook with love to them I say you can improve greatly if you follow the Sokolowskis and cook with skill and pride."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of cafeteria-style comfort food.  Their chicken paprikash is delicious!  Their desserts - including the carrot cake and the coconut cake - are divine.  Their food selection, in addition to their beverage selection, is great!  And if you get a seat in the piano room when the piano player is in, you'll have a wonderful accompaniment to down-home food."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times for dinner, but I can't get enough of this Polish goodness! Don't be intimidated by the long lines - the line moves fast with the cafeteria style service, and you'll get your food by about the same time if you had sat down and ordered at another restaurant. All entrees come with two sides, a roll, and an unlimited salad bar plate, so you're guaranteed to be happily stuffed by the end of your meal.

Some of my favorites include their prieogies, chicken paprikash, and stuffed cabbage. The honey glazed meatloaf (which is offered every now and then) is also delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Dinner Spot in Town!! Pierogies are amazing. Best Salisbury Steak and Meatloaf. Salad bar isn't the best but it complimentary with a meal. Bring a jacket, they keep the air on full blast in the summer."}
{"text":"Delightfully tacky decor featuring all kinds of Cleveland-centric memorabilia.  Typically a 30-45 minute wait in line.  Dinner here is a delicious, stick to your ribs retro-style meal.  Pierogies, fried Walleye, schnizel & dumplings will never pass Mrs. Obama's test, but they sure are good, and Sokolowski's does them all very well.  Some of the best comfort food you could get."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! As a kid, my grandmother used to love taking my cousins and I here. 
Admittedly I didn't like it back then, but now this is one of my favorites in Cleveland! 
The portions are GIANT, and I mean Giant!!! It is cafeteria style, so you walk through the line and pick what you want. Most dinners come with 2 side dishes, and the salad bar. Most things cost $12-$16 but there is quite a range of options. Last time I was here, I got the pork chops. I could cut them with my fork, they were so tender! 
I just love this place. Check their hours before you go, though, as they are usually not open for dinner during the week."}
{"text":"Um wow. The food here was amazing. It is cafeteria style. We were not expecting such a long line for 4:30-5:00, but there was and it wrapped around the entire restaurant. We did not want to wait on the line so we instead got it to go which was far more faster than waiting on the regular line. The pierogies were amazing."}
{"text":"I am Polish and am a huge fan of Polish food especially homemade.  When I first heard about Sokolowski's Inn I knew I had to try it.  I tried the Stuffed Cabbage, Mashed Potatoes and Cabbage and Noodles.

PROS: The Stuffed Cabbage was HUGE! I even had leftovers to take home! The stuffed cabbage was sweet and just added salt to it.  The mashed potatoes were so good! A bit chunky and had chunks of potatoes which usually I dislike but the way they did it worked for them! The cabbage and noodles was okay but there could've been more noodles and less cabbage. Staff is friendly and helpful.

CONS: If you go for dinner try to go right when they open!  They get busy and the lines are very long! Once you get towards the bar the line does move faster.  The prices are a little high but it's worth it.  Maybe they should include drink with a dinner instead of separate?

Overall an amazing restaurant with great food and good staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am actually SHOCKED that Sokolowski's continues to get even passing ratings.  

I have been to Sokolowski's any number of times, and I really used to enjoy it.   Although I wouldn't call their pierogis the best, or even close to the best, the used to be decent.   The last 3 or 4 times we have been there, we have been horribley disappointed.   Yep, 3 or 4 times of bad food.   We were just sure that the kitchen was just having an off day, or maybe their supplier had given them subpar food.   The last time we were there, everything had a sort of chemical taste to it.   None of the table of 4 adults that I was with was able to eat even half of our food, and we left and went elsewhere to eat.   We had a veriety of foods that day and everything was bad.  Kielbasa was dried out, stuffed cabbage was bland, pierogi was swimming in grease, and again flavorless.   There was a time when Sokolowski's was the flagship of Eastern European foods, and even my grandmother would have approved.   Sadly that ship has sailed.   We will never return."}
{"text":"Hard to find a downside. Nice for us non-Clevelanders if it opened for lunch on Saturday, I guess.  Great food, great selection, love the old school atmosphere. Be prepared to wait in line  our party enjoyed pierogis, sausage, porkchops, a variety of beers, sauerkraut, cheesecake , great sides. All good.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The Kielbasa mushroom barley soup are so good you'll die. This is one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners. It is really unique and they do a phenomenal job."}
{"text":"Wow - you can't help but smile the moment you walk into this place.  It's in the middle of an industrial section of Cleveland.  You eventually wind your way there and this little cozy pub/inn style building looks very inviting.  You get inside and the specials board has a homey feel to it. 

I love pierogis, so I went for the pierogi meal.  I couldn't stop there though, I had the carrot cake, brat, and root beer.  The food didn't quite rock my world but it was all very good.  The pierogis were boiled and pan fried.  I prefer them just boiled.  They had a healthy amount of butter and onion on them which I loved.  I had kraut and beans on the sides.  They were both well done and everything mixed together very well.  I often scooped up portions of everything on my plate at once.  The Brat was a little disappointing.  It was flavorful, but a little dry.  Again, it mixed well with the other food, but it didn't hold up well on its own.  The carrot cake was amazing.  I love carrot cake and this did not disappoint.  Big chunks of nuts and fruit in the cake.  Yummy icing.  If only I had room in my stomach to eat more than a few bites.

I would definitely recommend this place for the overall warm feeling and full tummy that it leaves you with.  I definitely left there feeling like a I had experienced a gem of Cleveland.  Here's to many more years of great business for the University Inn.  Oh - and bring a friend.  Because I guarantee you're going to want to try more than you can possibly eat.  I would have been much better off splitting my food with someone else and ordering just 1 more side."}
{"text":"This place will forever hold a special place in my heart for this is where I met the sweetest Clevelanders to date.  It's cafeteria style Polish cuisine and a Cleveland establishment. This was featured on Food Network. Memorabilia from sports stars to rock stars, including autographed photos and mementos from famous diners, cover the walls.  When you first walk in, you pick up a tray, silverware, napkins and go through the line picking what you want.  Dessert comes first, then drinks, then you can pick between a combination of foods depending on the meal you pick. I had a main dish with two sides.  I was a little iffy on the proper way to do it, so I asked a woman in line next to me. Before I knew it I was sitting at their table, singing happy birthday to her mom and learning all about Cleveland!  

I haven't had a lot of polish food and because of the many who immigrated here years ago, Polish food is a tradition in Cleveland. Named one of Cleveland's best restaurants by Gourmet magazine, it has been featured on several network food spots. I had pierogis (SO good), Chicken Paprikash (very delicious) and stuffed cabbage. The meal also comes with a salad bar. Oh, and live music!  If a gentlemen asks to carry your tray to your table, let him.  There were a few guys standing near the cashier waiting to do just that.  I had a great visit to the University Inn!  Great memories!"}
{"text":"What a line; what a meal. When we arrived, the line was out the door, but within 5 minutes we were inside. The rooms were warm and inviting and covered with famous faces and Cleveland history.  If the line is long and you're thirsty, you can send one of your party to grab beer from the bar. At the end of the line, you finally reach food service. There, you start with desserts (the berry pie's good, especially the crust) and then order your food in A cafeteria style line. The potato and cheese pierogis are delicious, the sauerkraut not overly pungent, and the stuffed cabbage immense and chock full of a meaty mix.  Don't skip the garlicky rolls, but the salad really isn't necessary. There is plenty of food, so help yourself to a to go box at the register.  Overall, it's a Cleveland tradition for a reason!"}
{"text":"This has been a family destination for dinner even before I was born. The Penney family loves Sokolowkis!!"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is a pretty easy place to rate.

On history, ambience, and character, it gets five stars easily.  I'd never been to Cleveland before and we sailed off the interstate and up 14th toward Sokolowski's as soon as we rolled into town.  For an outsider, even the restaurant's setting signifies pure rust-belt Cleveland:  It's perched above a scuzzy industrial section of the Cuyahoga River, facing downtown.  Inside is a rabbit warren of different old rooms, mostly brick-walled and claustrophobic, that will take you back a few decades.  Food is served is via a cafeteria line that looks like it hasn't been redone since about 1961.  Very friendly servers on the other side were quite helpful with us first-timers.  We carried our food into what looked like one of the larger of the rooms, which, with its standards-playing piano player, felt like an old-time cocktail lounge:  Great atmosphere, especially for lunch time.

As for the food, I found it to be quite overrated and just a little above average, at least on this occasion.  Between seeing Michael Symon and others on television and folks on the Internet raving about the pierogis, you'd think they were perfectly puffy little pillows packed with TNT morsels of flavor.  But even if they were buttery and the potato stuffing was pretty bold and satisfying, they were actually served kinda lukewarm and were a little leaden from sitting out for too long.  The sides--green beans, mac and cheese, and a Polish noodle-and-cabbage concoction--were a bit bland.  Portions for the money, though, were pretty huge.  Go hungry.

An assortment of bottled beers, including what looked like several Polish and Eastern European selections, was available.  

For me, the entire experience averaged out to an even four stars.  If you're from out of town, you should check it out, but don't expect the food to be superb as it's hyped up to be."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a treasure. It's one of the last of a certain kind of Polish supper club that my grandparents loved back in the day. 

Everything is cafeteria-style. The first time I ate here there was an hour and a half line almost out the door for dinner, but the second time I came close enough to closing time that there was no line at all. So come late for quick service. 

Pirogues are enormous, al dente, and delicious. They're basically just huge ravioli filled with mashed potato and soaked in butter. Sauerkraut is actually sour and, big surprise, soaked in butter. Excellent. But the big item, if you ask me, is the stuffed cabbage (filled with meat and rice). No one knows how to do this dish right anymore spare a few grandmas, and their rendition is classic. I wouldn't change anything about it, including their homemade tomato sauce/gravy. 

The big surprise was their 'house' brand grape soda, which we bought ironically and ended up greedily drinking."}
{"text":"A true Cleveland experience. Old school cafeteria style serving with a buffet of can't miss selections. I recommend the meatloaf, stuffed cabbage, pork chops, and pierogies first and foremost. Truly anything is great, but those stand as something truly special even for a city that is filled with polish cuisine. Don't worry about the wait, the line moves fast even when its out the door, and you can always get a beer or drink while you anxiously wait. 

Whatever you do, do not go in here with expectations. Let the food and atmosphere speak for itself. Great experience with exceptionally good comfort food"}
{"text":"Truly a Cleveland landmark restaurant that must be experienced! Great food too."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot.  Big portions. Pretty good food. Like going to Mamma's at home.  No ambiance, just a bunch of tables bunched together, brown plastic paneling on the walls, combo carpet and vinyl tile with drop ceiling."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food.  Friendly staff.  Price was ok, maybe on the high side for dive lunch spot.  $17 with tip for 1 person.  But while in Rome..."}
{"text":"This place opened for workers of yore building the bridges CLE is known for. Thank you so much for not closing once the bridges were built. What a great institution of Cleveland culture. It's cafeteria style in your grandparent's-from-Croatia/Poland/Hungary/Germany house. There is a long line during peak hours but there is plenty to look at while you wait. You should go to Sokolowski's just to say you've been there. Jimmy Fallon made a point to go there last year, and so should you!"}
{"text":"This place is a proper institution. It should be considered a historical landmark, if it's not already. This is usually a stop for friends and family who visit Cleveland. The food portions are good and HUGE."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to say that I've lived in Cleveland for 7 years, and just tried this place last week.  Yum Yum Yum ALERT!  This was an amazing lunch - just be warned that your lunch comes with a free nap after.  Food Coma! 

As recommended, we sampled the Pierogies.  These are a little piece of heaven.  Each bite I kept saying, \"Oh my goodness, these are amazing!\" - and it was true, each time. 

On the side, I sampled the sweet potatoes and green beans.  Both were great, as expected, but didn't even stand a chance in outshining the main event. 

This is a piece of Cleveland History and you feel the Cleveland pride with each bite. I'm a huge Hall and Oates fan, so their signed photo on the wall was the perfect hilarious icing on the Sokolowski's cake!"}
{"text":"So yum.  We waited in line for awhile but so worth the wait......I highly recommend eating here of u get the chance."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of years ago and I remember the food being really good. You order it cafeteria style and the place has a homey vibe to it. We got...

Breaded pork chops, chicken marsala, pierogies, chocolate cake, and strawberry cheese cake. All yummy."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland!!!  I remember when their peirogies were twice the size they are now, but hey they're hand made and I'm sure making them smaller is less burden.

Whats better than butter, I ask you?  when there is actually stuff floating in it!  Like pierogi, saurkraut, fish, sausage, stuffed peppers/cabbage, salisbury steak, chicken cordon bleu, dumplings, did I mention pierogies...

This place will always hold a place in my heart, and not just from clogging my arteries, the first time back there while visiting from Denver(I'm from Cleve) i told Bernie that I loved this place and its always the first meal I eat when I'm in town.  After eating I asked for some pierogie and saurkraut to go for a friend and he handed me a massive to go box jammed full and didn't even charge me, now thats loyalty my friends.

Cafetreia style service allows you to pick from 3 or 4 main dishes and plenty of starchy sides, seriously if you don't like butter, I would stay very far away from this place.  You may think you have too much food on your plate but don't forget the roll(don't worry, they'll remind you) to soak up that velvety yellow goodness.

Oh, not to be too gross but don't plan any fancy events after because it takes an avg of about 30-40mins for your meal to slide through.

The decor is classic with alot of Cleveland history, try and sit where Bill Clinton ate.  I almost asked the Sokolowski daughter to marry me on the spot so I could be apart of this great tradition for years to come."}
{"text":"We went here entirely based upon the strength of other Yelper's suggestions, which I'm increasingly finding to be what I should listen to in regard to where to eat, where to stay, where to play, etc. when I visit other cities.  We weren't disappointed.

The breakdown: cafeteria-style Polish and European food, the kind that leaves you gibbering with delight while promising to equal a gut-punch later on - in short, loads of starch, carbs, and other wonders.  All housed in a veritable warren of rooms crammed with photos of the famous who've eaten there and the normal folks, many of whom one could tell made this restaurant a regular experience.  Definitely an overall family vibe, as in \"Welcome home - sit yourself down and gorge on this delicious meal.  Laugh a bit while you're at it, and enjoy a good brew, too.\"

Rule of thumb: follow the line, and you'll be okay.  We skipped the desserts, displayed initially, but each opted for a Sokolowski's bottled fizzy beverage (she got green apple and didn't enjoy it too much, but my root beer was fine) and water.  The main specials for the day are listed on the wall, so definitely get a feel for what's coming from that.  I ordered the baked meatloaf with mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and the salad bar.  She ordered perogies (which she obsesses over anyway), mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and the salad bar.  In addition, we each snagged one of the fresh-baked rolls from a basket on the counter.  When it was all said and done, we ended up paying around $27.00 for everything.  Not crushing on the wallet, but not particularly ridiculously affordable, either (hence the ol' 4-star rating).

The stuffed cabbage looked dang good, but I was pleased that I chose the baked meatloaf - oh, most humble and unassuming of meals that it can be.  This wasn't, featuring bursts of different flavors and rendering the already delicious mashed potatoes near-heavenly when  eaten together.  She was thrilled about her perogies, and we both raved about the hot, fresh rolls.  They were SO good - possibly one of my favorite parts of the meal, as silly as that sounds.  While the salad bar was okay, it wasn't anything spectacular, and I ended up feeling as though it had been made available simply to tack a few bucks onto the bill.  Honestly, we hardly touched our salads, but we're weird that way - we always eat those last.

Delicious, homey, decidedly ethnic, and, I'm sure, murder on any sort of diet plan you're attempting to implement.  Wonderful comfort food, however.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food in the city.  Table got stuffed cabbage, perogies, meatloaf, and pork chops.  I mean everything was amazing and the perogies are to die for, unreal."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We loved this place on a recent visit to Cleveland.  It is old school to the max and I mean that in a great way.  The food was excellent and I only wish I had two stomachs.  If you leave here still hungry, you have a serious problem.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Despite living in Cleveland for most of my life (and in Tremont for at least six months), I have never, until recently, made the trip to Sokolowski's. In addition to the local hype this place gets, it was recently profiled in Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation program, which only augmented my desire to head over and check it out. 

So, I walk in and I immediately enjoy the lay out and atmosphere. I liked the interior decor with the old, rustic antique ambiance glittered with Polish paraphernalia. The Polka music playing in the background complemented the whole scene.

Sokolowski's has a cafeteria style set up. Just grab a tray, wait in line, take what your eyes desire, place it on the tray, pay, grab a seat and enjoy. 

I ordered a Kielbasi with Perogies and Sauerkraut. The Kielbasi was pretty good, the Perogies were amazing, and the Sauerkraut was really strong! If you really like strong, pungent sauerkraut, then you'd love it. I'm used to the more mild variety offered at hot dog stands. The meal went really well with the Russian pilsner beer from some St. Petersburg Brewery. I'll admit; I couldn't finish my meal. I was stuffed, and there was no way I could handle dessert after eating that meal and drinking the pilsner--although I'll admit that the desert options looked really tempting."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed! The quality, staff and atmosphere is great! 

You don't need to order anything special - the food that is prepared is already so good! Kraut and pierogies are spot on!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bring your elastic pants! 
Simple comfort food that will leave you full and satisfied.   As I was in line waiting to select my dish, I kept changing my mind as I watched the other plates being filled in front of me.  They all looked amazing.  I was in the mood for some old world grub, so I opted for the Kielbasa and Sauerkraut, with a side of Pierogi's and Noodles.  Come here hungry, you'll need all of your appetite."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is a Cleveland institution that really needs to be experienced by everyone, so when I friend who used to live here was back visiting I had to take him.  Located in the shadow of the new Innerbelt bridge in a corner of Tremont you will get one of the best views of the Cleveland skyline.  Parking can be had in the small lot or find a place on the street; even on a very busy lunch in the week between Christmas and New Year we found a space nearby.  

Serving lunch all week and dinner on Friday and Saturday, you will usually encounter a line, but it moves at a decent rate; the good news is that you have a chance to look at all the pictures and memorabilia that is crammed into the dining areas and bar.  Sports, Cleveland History and just about everything else is represented here in the dim rooms creating a old school atmosphere that is hard to match.  Just before the cafeteria line you will go through the bar area with a major bobble-head collection and a window showing the skyline.  

The cafeteria line starts with salads and desserts wrapped in plastic wrap; old school all the way.  Next is a selection of beverages and finally the main courses.  You can choose a huge sandwich or a hot entree, most of which are Eastern European influenced.  I selected the eggplant ptarmigan which was a huge brick of fried eggplant slices, tomato sauce and cheese, with a side of pierogies for $.50 more I had more food than I ever expected.  The eggplant was very good in a nostalgic way and the pierogies were delicious pillows of potato filling inside melt in your mouth pasta.  The food here is very straightforward and well prepared, you will not be surprised, but you will get huge portions of well prepared staples.   Entrees available when we were there included Kielbasi, Goulash and Chicken Paprikash.  Most of the portions were so large that they were giving you the sides on extra plates.  

Going to Sokolowski's will not be a transcendent culinary experience, but you will get huge portions of very good food in an atmosphere that everyone who visits Cleveland should try; amazingly many local residents still have not given it a try, but this is a living part of C-Towns history - go try it."}
{"text":"One of my huge guilty pleasures.  My nana took me here so many times when I was a kid and the memories are part of the allure here.  The place is a part of Cleveland history.  Cafeteria style of amazing comfort food.  A Cleveland must try to anyone from out of town...Sokolowski's has been here since 1923 and you still hear people just going here for the first time.  The neighborhood around is sure changing but this place remains a constant.  Thank goodness they charge by item and not by weight because you get a TON of food.  The Salisbury Steak is literally the size of a softball and stuffed peppers are equally huge.  Try the street chicken too. The pierogies are wonderful and buttery evilness.   Come here for lunch on a Friday or near holidays and be prepared to wait in line.  I'd try a little earlier and before noon.  Always a hit and one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Other than the homemade food my Polish grandparents made, this is the best Polish food you will ever eat (but of course I'm biased towards my grandparents recipes). The kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, pierogi, and sauerkraut are just perfect here. Great selection of beers just tops it off, including Great Lakes and Polish beer. I need to get back here ASAP."}
{"text":"Great Polish food, I grew up eating most of these dishes and they are authenitc and awesome. There will almost always be a wait, so come prepared to stand for at least 10 minutes. They serve you cafe style, meaning the food is on the line and you tell them what you want, don't worry it is FRESH and quality.

The decor is awesome since it is an old inn that they kept pretty much in tact, love the atmosphere, the location of the restaurant is a little out of the way, but the fact that they have such great food drives people from all over to try."}
{"text":"With out a doubt the finest example of good old fassioned, just like mom would make,  real comfort food. If you have any trace of Polish or Eastern Euro blood flowing through your body, then this is the place for you. The cafetira style of serving, location and ambiance all balance well with the food. Everything that is made at Sokolowski's is genuine, no BS real food for real people. You must try the stuffed cabbage WONDERFUL.. The salisbury steak is spot on! The pierogi best in the mid west. I highly endorse the value of this TRUE Cleveland dining experiance! Get there and enjoy.

{"text":"Phenomenal lunch.
Line at 1245...by 120 line was gone. I imagine it's packed at noon.
I'd suggest going OFF PEAK.
The sirloin steak was one of the best lunches, ever."}
{"text":"I went to Sokolowski's because I knew I had to have bratwurst and pierogies before leaving Cleveland.  I had a mission.

One of the first things I noticed about Sokolowski's, while standing in the slow-moving line (don't come here absolutely starving, you'll be in pain by the time you get your food) was that it's a sausage-fest both literally and figuratively.  The line was about 85% male, 100% of them middle-aged.  I can't explain this.

I got to the front of the line and the first thing you get to is dessert.  You pick your dessert first.  Seriously.  But I was on a mission, so I restrained myself from picking up one of the many delicious-looking varieties of cake and proceeded to the real food.

Service, once you get to the point where you're interacting with people, was actually pretty friendly.  I expected it to be rushed and gruff, but the guy at the counter took the time to explain what everything was to the guy behind me in line, and the cashier lady offered me water when she saw I wasn't getting a drink.  I got a bratwurst, which comes with two sides.  For me, 2 pierogies and green beans.  Plus a roll.  Total: a little over $8.  Awesome.

The food was great.  It was one of those meals that just made me really, really happy.  I can't say I know what an authentic Polish pierogi is supposed to taste like, but these were delicious.  I kind of wished I'd just gotten pierogies.  Not that the bratwurst wasn't good--I mean it was pretty tasty, but a tiny bit too gristly and didn't come close to the pierogies.  The roll was very good.  The green beans tasted like green beans.  They were really only there to counterbalance the heaviness of the brat and pierogies.  My biggest complaint is that nothing was really hot enough.  I know it's served cafeteria-style, so keeping things hot is tricky, but I don't like my food lukewarm.

Sokolowski's was my final real meal in Cleveland, and it was definitely a good way to round off my trip.  If I ever find myself back in northeast Ohio, there's no doubt that I'll be making another stop."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Sokolowski's?  Realize it's a cafeteria type setting but the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Super cool place. Haven't been a buffet style place like this before. Had a ton of cool pictures on the walls with the famous people that have eaten there. Food was kinda disappointing tho. Kielbasa was over cooked and dry, and the perogies didn't have a ton of flavor like I thought they would've. Buddy of mine got the Salisbury steak and I tried a bite and it was really good. Overall I would say a pretty experience just didn't hit my buttons on taste."}
{"text":"Eastern European comfort food....cafeteria style.  Chicken paprikas is awesome as are the cabbage rolls and meat loaf.  I grew up making perogies so I'm a bit spoiled and I don't care for theirs.  They're very efficient and the line moves quickly.  Lots and lots of choices...including a full salad bar.  Full bar too!  Get there early...that line gets long before the doors open!"}
{"text":"The sad thing is, if Sokolowski's wasn't SO hyped up, I might've given it a better rating. But after reading Yelp, I was expecting the BEST homemade polish food EVER. and... the food was great, but not the best.

I love the cozy-ness of the restaurant, the friendliness of the staff, and the cafeteria-style of it. It definitely made me feel like I was back in the dorms.. with my cafeteria tray, utensils, and picking/choosing the food I want-- I LOVE IT! I love that it brings back college memories.

Now for the food.. here's everything I tried: Chicken Paprikash, green beans, corn on the cob, steamed clams, bread roll, perogies, and meatloaf.

Deliciousness: Chicken Paprikash, Perogies, and Meatloaf. Needless to say, it's always good when the best food a restaurant makes are its ENTREE food. The chicken was sooo tender, the perogies was cooked to perfect (and it was homemade), and the meatloaf was just as good. 

Mediocre: Corn on the cob. Well, it's pretty hard to mess up on corn on the cob...it tasted like a regular good cob.


MEHs..: Green beans, steamed clams. The green beans didn't have enough flavors and the clams were very small (and expensive!!!). It was 12 small clams... so wasn't what I was expecting.

However, I love the atmosphere of Sokolowski's AND I love the portions they give! You will definitely be full at this place. THe only thing that was pricey was the clams (maybe not though, if it was bigger!)


PS- the roll was sooooo good. If you love butter as much as i do, TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is comfort food, plain and simple. While some parts of this place gross me out (the dusty CLE memorabilia on the shelves, the open salad bar, etc.) there's no denying that the food is good. And although Polish food isn't necessarily my favorite, good food is good food. I'd recommend the clam bakes that take place during the fall and include a dozen clams, a half chicken, sides & salad. Sokolowski's is Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of people. Great spot for a group.

The lay out is a bit confusing if you have never been here. This was my 1st time so I popped that cherry.

The lines can long especially if it's lent. Speaking  about lent they had several kinds of fish prepared numerous styles.  Salmon, Chilean Sea bass, cod, walleye to name a few. I was going to have fish but being my 1st time I wanted the full experience.
Our group sat in the Pope room,  he was watching me very closely, if  you have been there you what I'm talking about Willis.

Chicken paprikash was really good, large chunk of bird i a super savory sauce. Really, really good. Beer is sold at a reasonable price and the servers are super friendly despite the chaos. Yeah this place lives up to the hype, as Flava Flav does not say \"belive the hype\""}
{"text":"First time trying out Polish food!
Their perogies are phenomenal, and so is this unique style of dining.
Brought me back to my old memories of eating at a cafeteria - with lunch trays and picking out/ordering what I would like to eat.
Except for this time, the quality and the excellency of food surpasses that of our old cafeteria food.

On top of their awesome perogies, I got their chicken paprikash, and oh man - they are wonderful.

Definitely get one meal + two sides deal."}
{"text":"It pains me to say this but my last visit a week ago was very disappointing. I'm hoping it was just an off night. I got the stuffed cabbage again, and the cabbage was burnt. The filling tasted kind of funky, too, and the tomato sauce slapped on top of my cabbage and mashed potatoes tasted kind of---bitter? It was weird. I ended up unable to finish my meal, which if you know me NEVER happens. My boyfriend's kielbasa was pretty good, though. The sauerkraut was a tad too mushy. The mac-n-cheese was strictly okay. 

The pierogis, on the other hand, were a saving grace to a very lackluster meal. Yes, they are pretty much soaked in butter but if you wipe them off a tad and dip those bad boys in sour cream, just wow. They tasted just as good the next day, too.  

I brought two lovely friends here as they had never been and we were all very excited to stuff ourselves with Polish comfort food. The ambience is wonderfully jolly and overall we had a great time. The food just wasn't on point and we left with some sadness in our heart."}
{"text":"In Heaven they may not serve beer, but I am almost certain they will serve Sokolowski's!

If I were able to pick my last meal. It would be something from Sokolowski's menu. You just can't lose. I have eaten there like 100 times and I still haven't even had anything mediocre. It is always awesome and I always leave stuffed. I love the meatloaf the various chicken dishes, and don't forget to rock your belly to sleep with Pierogies. I am telling you I didn't even like Pierogies until I broke down and tries one at Sokolowski's. The first time I ate at this place was like the first time I heard Black by Pearl Jam. I nearly cried. Get it.

You certainly owe it to yourself if you have not been here to try it. I would say a first timer has to try the Cabbage Rolls, meatloaf, pierogies, mashed potatoes, or any combination of such. Long live sokolowski's"}
{"text":"This IS Cleveland.  This place is in my bones.  It's down home, stick to your ribs comfort food done to perfection.  Nothing pretentious here at all.  I have eaten here so many times and have come here for so many gatherings that this place is like family to me.  In fact, take a look around at all the photos and you will feel like you're in a museum of Cleveland's Soul.  Everything I had is just so damned delicious.  Salisbury steak, chicken paprikash, schnitzel, pork chops, stuffed cabbage, PRIME RIB!!!!, trout, perch, walleye, dumplings and the PIEROGIES!  Just great food.  If you need a break from all the trendy new places and want to get back to your roots then you must come here.  Come here and have a drink at the bar while having one the most amazing views of Downtown."}
{"text":"Cleveland classic. Reminds me of my Baba. You can skip all the fancy stuff down the street and get the best dinner in town here. Everyone here makes you feel like part of the family"}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday 4/29/16. As usual the food was amazing! But the best part of our visit was the bartender Rick. He was truly awesome! My drink was always filled and you can tell he loves what he does. He made this polish weekend celebration one of the best!"}
{"text":"Awsome as always.  Friendly staff, great food.  A true Cleveland classic.  Pierogis are a must have!!!   Be sure to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I've only eaten lunch here and although it's been crowded each time I've come, there's never been a problem with long lines.  My wait time is usually about 15 minutes.  I've never been for dinner but I've heard it can get a little crazy.
The food is ridiculous.  It's usually the only meal I'll eat the whole day.  I agree that the perogies are good, but nothing too exceptional.  However, the cabbage and noodles, weinerschnitzel, stuffed cabbage and pretty much everything they have is amazing.  The portions are huge and it's deceiving that they put the desserts first.  Good marketing tactic.  They look so tempting you grab one and don't realize there's no way you're gonna finish it until you get to the end of the line.  
Everyone working is friendly and personable and makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"If I could pick just one place in America to go to dinner every day for the rest of my life I cannot imagine a better choice. Old school supper club meets lunch buffet.
And the family and staff here? Salt of the earth midwestern polish Americans that work hard and hit it out of the park everyday. This is it!"}
{"text":"My polish grandmother is weeping from heaven.
Wanted to try Sokolowski's ever since I saw it profiled on \"No Reservations\" so it was our first stop on our trip to Cleveland to visit the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame from DC.
Super long line (Indians game just let out) but still went by pretty quickly considering. Everything looked amazing (and frighteningly large) but had my heart set on the stuffed cabbage, a dish I hadn't had since my grandmother passed away 10 years ago....
Wow. Just wow.
Lighter than it looks, tender, amazing. Blows my dear, departed grandma's out of the water...sorry grandma.
Husband had Kielbasa...smokey porkey goodness. The piggy that gave his life for this should be practically sainted.
Pierogi are everything everyone says they are...in a word, AMAZING. Worth the 6 hour trip alone. Seriously.
Go. Fly, drive, swim...whatever. Just go. Now."}
{"text":"If you want food that will make you sleepy and happy for days, this is it! Pierogies, stuffed cabbage, and don't forget dessert! Absolutely a national treasure you must try at least once."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's has such a cozy ambiance to it. It's a great restaurant to have a nice get together with family and friends. If you go for dinner there might be a wait, but if you go during the week when they open for lunch you most likely won't have to wait long at all. 

If you can't find a parking spot in front of the building, there is a lot across the street off Abbey Ave. Also, there is a great view of the Cleveland skyline!

The food is amazing. The Pierogies are buttery and delicate. I always get the Chicken Paprikash, it's my favorite meal. I've tried the Mac and Cheese side dish and that is very cheesy and done well. 

The staff is nice and someone usually carries my tray to the table which is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Cafeteria-style restaurant. There was no problem finding a spot because the staff places you and your party at a table while you are at the check out.

Food was really good.

Only negative bit is I felt rushed to order, which made me feel a little awkward.

I would come here again and recommend this place to other people for good food with good company."}
{"text":"Great for old world cooking.....got the meatloaf and the pierogis...all were good.....interesting place just outside of downtown...."}
{"text":"This is definitely a Cleveland institution to visit.  The perogis were delicious, the Salisbury steak was good (it was more like a Salisbury meatball), and the rest of the dishes were passable.  The salad bar was a disgrace.  The staff was above and beyond helpful and nice and made it a great experience.  Prices were great."}
{"text":"I will say in all of my 32 years of living in Cleveland, I have always heard of this place, but had not sampled it until recently.  I was amazed to find it as a cafeteria style restaurant with a plethora of Cleveland memorabilia decorating the halls.  Really a cool concept.  The menu as I am sure you have heard is comfort food.  Yep. Perfect summary. Comfort food.  Health does not belong here and my doctor had a heart attacking knowing I was going here.  This business supports the Cleveland Clinic.  For all I know the clinic supports it.  Food like this tastes great.  Lots to try.  I'm a polish boy myself.  I had city chicken here for the first time unseasoned.  Not how my momma made it, but man it did taste good.  Left me full and wishing I was still a meat eater yet again."}
{"text":"I went here years ago. I can't give a fully accurate review, but I'll say it was okay. I remember the food that I ordered being a little greasy, but that's Polish food for ya'."}
{"text":"Good luck finding better Polska/Hungarian style food anywhere else in the Midwest. I am Polish and have grown up with the taste. For a restaurant that serves everything en masse buffet-style, the food quality is fantastic. Everyone who goes here has something else as their favorite thing to get. I would suggest making multiple visits and trying different things each time because getting too many different things at the same time really kinda overfills your stomach and dries up the wallet. If you get there and the line is out the door, suck it up and get in line. It's worth every second!"}
{"text":"A must in Cleveland! Good ethnic food"}
{"text":"At first glance, you wouldn't think the food would be delicious, but, oh my word, the red cabbage is amazing, the pierogis are like oniony heaven (don't forget the sour cream, you'll need it), and the pork schnitzel is pretty dang good. All in all a great experience and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"***Travelers - super surprised no one recommended this place when I asked for favorite Cleveland eats. This experience should be at the top of your list!***

HISTORY: 
Located in the heart of Tremont, Sokolowski's University Inn has been serving Polish and Eastern European cuisine since 1923. It is Cleveland's oldest owned and family operated restaurant. It is now owned by three of the grandchildren of the original owners that established the place in 1923 and is also a James Beard Foundation \"American Classics\" Award-winning restaurant. 

They specialize in comfort food, with a traditional Polish and American menu. Find dishes like: chicken paprikash, stuffed cabbage, and of course, their pierogis! 

KNOW BEFORE YOU GO: 
There will be a line, a BIG ONE. We didn't really read the reviews before coming and the experience of entering this place was hysterical. We always joke - where there is a line, there is a good reason. When we are in a new city and see a line, we always jump in it! And so far we have never been disappointed. This place was no different. We stood there wondering - if we are just ordering the  do we still stand in this line? YES.

Pro-tip there is a bar about halfway down the giant line, send someone from your group to buy a round and bring them back. While you wait in this stunning line that wraps in and around this historic restaurant you will see family heirlooms and celebrities lining the walls. 

WHAT TO ORDER:
There are TONS of these white paper signs taped up around the restaurant with specials. My advice is to know what you want before you get up to the cafeteria style line. Yes, it is cafeteria style. I don't know that I have ever seen a restaurant still operating like this. You choose your pie, whatever you want to drink - they even have beer in line (HA)! Then you pick from the spread there. We opted for a dozen pierogis to split. THIS WAS THE WRONG CHOICE! These things were MASSIVE and so heavy/comforting. I could only eat two before I was full - seriously. I would order a sampler of things and get two pierogis as a side, they offer them for $1.25 for two. 

Overall I thought the entire experience of this place was hilarious and really made our trip memorable. The pierogis were insanely delicious and comforting for sure. I will admit I was a little disappointed they weren't seared as much as I would've liked since they were just sitting in the bin with the others when they fished them out. But the flavor was there and the sour cream was the perfect compliment. 

These pierogis are now on my list of \"things I had to have in other city's and now I'm pissed because I will never have them again.\" 

Kudos to the family for keeping this place alive. It's obvious that what you are doing brings smiles to so many people's faces from locals to travelers alike."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Polish food, pirogies, schnitzel, stuffed cabbage, Salisbury Steak, so many homemade options along with dessert. A must try!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"No frills cafeteria style DAMN GOOD home style cooking.    Awesome Kielbasa and homemade pierogi's!!!"}
{"text":"Home run. Everything about it. Owners were there working late Friday night. We did family style with party of 9 and everything was tremendous. Waiting in line to get food was a plus - makes you more hungry and you take in the whole atmosphere. 

Go see all the pictures on the wall before you leave, lots of famous people have been through the line here."}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland and decided that Pirogi sounded good.  So we Yelped and saw all the nice reviews of Sokolowski's and decided that it would be good choice for real Polish food.

Well first of all the food was pretty good.  But what we didn't know until we got there is that Sokolowski's is really not a restaurant.  It is more a cafeteria that serves Polish fare exclusively.  That is not a bad thing.  It's just a fact.

On the night we arrived, right around dinner time, a large athletic group of about 80 kids had descended on the place.  So as soon as we walked in the door, we saw a long line of these kids and maybe another two hundred or more people lined up from the steam table counters, past the front door, wrapping around corners and ending up at the back door of the restaurant.  We were considering just giving up, but we figured that this place must be really great to have line like this.  So we decided to stick it out.

We chatted with the other loyal patrons and found out that most had been here before and that they really liked the place.  After waiting about an hour to get to the food, we selected as typical Polish fare as we could order.  They do have items like Prime rib, grilled Tilapia and New York Strip on the menu.  But instead of ordering generic menu items, we selected things like Pirogis, Sauerkraut, Kielbasa, Stuffed Cabbage, dumplings and the like.

The food, although served a bit cold, was generally tasty and plentiful.  The Freshly baked roils were really nice with a saltiness that made them a bit special. We had also opted for the Sokolowski branded bottled beverages over the fountain drinks and these were pretty good too.  A beer or two, which they do serve, would have gone well with the food, but since we were driving, we passed on that.

There was a basic salad bar with the usual choices of dressings and topping.  IT was nothing particularly special and salad was included with our dinners.

Some nice deserts were in evidence, but we passed on those too because we were driving.

All in all, this was a nice family style and inexpensive meal experience.  It was not fine-dining and we had to wait a long time for food that could have been served a bit warmer.  We did get our pirogi fix satisfied nicely and the Kielbasi, stuffed cabbage and Kraut, etc.  hit the spot.

I would go back again, but I would not wait an hour for a meal here again.  It was pretty good, but less than spectacular."}
{"text":"Love this place, wish I could go more often. I only ever get Salisbury Steak, mashed potatoes, and pierogies, maybe a piece of pie. It's great, if you havent tried it, you should. Just check to see when it's open before you go, it has weird hours."}
{"text":"We chose to stop at Sokolowski's after a visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame due to the excellent reviews and were not disappointed.  They have excellent Polish/American comfort food, served Cafeteria-line style.  I had the Pierogies (5 of them) with mashed potatoes (excellent) and green beans (boring but okay).  My girlfriend had the Salisbury steak which was also fantastic.  They have great beer and wine specials, with reasonable prices.  
The walls are covered with signed sports memorabilia and pictures of famous Clevelanders, which combined with the dark wood surfaces and comfortable lighting gives the place a welcoming, homey feel. The help was very pleasant and eager to give suggestions and help you choose something you'll like. 
We got there early for dinner and it was very quiet, but on the way out the line was out the door.  I'd recommend getting there early.  On July 15, 2011 University Ave was under construction and closed from the north side of town, and from the looks of it, it will be out of commission for quite a while.  There are parallel streets that make it easy to get around the closure."}
{"text":"Pierogis and Paprikash cafeteria style is a thing of beauty. People know. We came on New Year's Day observed holiday Monday and the line was obscene. Spectacular views and a bar worth sitting at, although, I wonder if anyone does? I love this place. Really need to come more often. Open for dinner until 9 on Fri & Sat."}
{"text":"I so loved this place.  efficient delicious friendly.  chicken paprika she and perogies where on point.   I flew into Cleveland and on TV was show about Cleveland food scene.    go here try and and love it.   you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Five stars, and I've never actually been here. Happened upon the booth at the Taste of Tremont. Holy cow the pierogis are AMAZING! So so so so good. I also had the chicken paprikash (chicken in that orange sauce) I believe that's what it's called, also amazing and super delicious! My friends had the stuffed cabbage and they all were raving about how good it was. Will def be coming to the restaurant for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Always great portions.  I have been there for lunch and dinner.  Atmosphere is unique."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, in my tummy. Sokolowskis did not disappoint! Boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Monday. We arrived a few minutes after they opened and there was already a line. We both ordered the chicken paprikash. Mmmmm it was so tasty. The restaurant also had a great family atmosphere, cool decor, and ample seating for large or small groups. Can't wait to go again! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Flavor flavor flavor!!!
So many people told me I had to go here while I was in Cleveland so of course it was on my list. But to be honest I wasn't super excited. I looked on Yelp and it didn't come across as super appealing to me. Man was I wrong!!! The perogi's were to die for! Mac and Cheese. Fried fish. Blackberry pie. Everything we had was absolutely DELICIOUS! The pictures don't do it justice. The flavor of everything was beyond my expectations. 
On top of how delicious the food was I cannot say enough for the family! When they learned we were from out of town the daughter (Mary?) took time to write down tons of recommendations. We spent quite a bit of time chatting with her, her brothers and their children. I don't exaggerate when I say they made us feel like family. It was such a wonderful experience. If you're in the area don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy a meal and great company here. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This place is like going to your grandma's house and all your aunts are cooking beside her. Not the prettiest of places but neither was my grandma's and I love it! Cafeteria style, ridiculously good food that will leave you so full it's comical. Or in danger of a coma if you're diabetic. Pierogies, kielbasa, meatloaf, potatoes, mac'n'cheese, adorable little slices of cakes...seriously, now I miss my grandma. 
Great place - a must do!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  Loved loved the homey feel of this Cleveland landmark.

We hit this place during the lunch rush, but the line was fast and we only had to wait for about twenty minutes.  

The food was delicious: tender chicken marsala, wonderfully flavorful steak, and buttery mashed potatoes.  Even the \"canned quality\" green beans were really good, and so were the homestyle rolls.  Something about the piping hot food, scooped onto your plate that made Sokolowski's pierce through my heart.

The perogies were life changing.  There's not much better than taking a starch, filling it with more starch, and then basting it in fried onions and butter.  It's even better the next day, when the butter has completely soaked in.

It's so refreshing to eat food made with a lot of love.  When life doesn't treat you well, eat Sokolowski's and you'll realize the beauty of love and simplicity.  It's one of the only restaurants (out of the many) that has left me with a sense of longing, a sense of tender love, even nearly a month later."}
{"text":"This place is a legend. It's a 5-star in it's category, which is casual down-home food. We went with a group of 12 at 5:30 on a Saturday; we were able to call ahead and get a few tables set aside for our large group. We waited about 45 minutes in a long and winding line before making it up to the cafeteria-style counter. They had all sorts of deliciousness, and I ate far more food than I needed. I had the pork chops and pierogi which were tasty and heavy. It's worth the wait even once to check this place off your list."}
{"text":"So before I start writing this, I would like the reader know my background. I am from Chicago and my parents are from Poland. The Chicago Metropolitan area, which has 9 million people living there, has over 1 million Polish Speaking people. On every block you will see a Polish Deli and many Polish restaurants in the city and the area. Meanwhile, Cleveland has over 3,000 Polish speaking people. This is important for tourists for which I will explain later. Sokolowski is not really an authentic Polish restaurant, but they try and I will give them so much respect for that.

When I first moved here from Chicago, I wanted that good Polish food with Polish people and Polish language. I went onto this beautiful website called yelp and I found out about this place. Just like me giving this place 5 starts, everyone else has as well. I really wanted to come here and I am so glad I did. The food was very good. The peirogies (take note...they do not roll their r like Polish Speaking people do. I have a little Polish accent still and they didn't understand peirogies when you roll the r...the American lady didn't know what I was asking) were very good. They had a great selection of food there as well. I had the pierogies, mash potatoes, green beans, and salad. All for 11 something dollars. Not a bad deal at all. It was very filling and again, the pierogies are awesome. There are many cool pics of Cleveland especially baseaball and football stuff (this is an americanized joint...so don't expect Poland's number one sport...soccer...to be on the walls).

Now with all that said, I would like to talk about my first paragraph. For ethnic Poles coming in from places from Chicago, New York, or even Poland itself. This is NOT a Polish ethnic restaurant. This is not Krystinas, U Gazdy, or EJ's Pierogies in the Chicago area. This is an Americanized joint serving some really good Polish food. The bartender and people behind the counter are not Polish. Cleveland is not like Chicago and they don't have a high Polish population and many have assimilated. HOWEVER....you need to check this place out. The sautéed Pierogies are amazing and and the food was awesome. They do serve kielbasa and guompki (they don't know what that is so just call it stuffed cabbage). And it's good. Sorry....no Zywiec here, but they do serve Okocim and one other Polish beer. I believe Stawski (?).  

If u want to go watch Poland during the Euro Championships and hang with Polish fans then don't come here. It's Americanized so baseball and football is huge here. 

One thing I was suprised about the Pierogies. They only had one flavor. So no meat Pierogies, farm cheese Pierogies, and stuff like that.

The history of the place is very cool though with the place growing when the bridge was being built and the workers wanted a place to eat. 

Great view of the bridge and city!"}
{"text":"Legend has it that some years ago, a long black limo pulled up to the restaurant, the driver opened the door and Martha Stewart stepped out.  She filled up on delicious food, then took various \"to go\" orders with her so that she could break down the ingredients and copy the dishes.  Don't know if it's so but we've been eating here for many years and it is the Best Damn Polish Food Place around.  We love it."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe I've lived in Cleveland for almost 13 years (yikes) and have never been to this place before. Came here with my mom earlier on a Saturday. It took a little getting used to standing in a long-ass line for what looked to be cafeteria-style food, but my lord did I have no idea of the food heaven that was awaiting me. Pork chops, pierogies, chicken paprikash, meatloaf, schnitzel ... I am currently staring at my screen and salivating, waiting for the next time I can go back. You're seated after you get your food, so no worries there about getting a seat on an extremely crowded day. And bonus points for us being sat in the piano room -- oh yeah, live lounge music while you devour some of the finest comfort food known to man? How could you go wrong? I'm considering maxxing out a bank loan to buy one of the now-insanely-expensive houses around there so I can just get drunk and walk here."}
{"text":"This place is such a Cleveland institution and if you haven't been there, you should go.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait in line for close to an hour.  It's cool though.  Grab a beer or two at the bar and drink it in line.  This place is not the healthiest place in Cleveland, but the food is great, the portions are huge and the atmosphere is fun.  They have a patio in the summer and the fireplace going in the winter.  It's one of my favorite places to go in the winter because it has a warm, homey feeling."}
{"text":"Buffet style food has never been so good. Selected the Salisbury steak, at recommendation of the server. Also had potatoes and pierogi. Very filling and large portions."}
{"text":"Come hungry.  I used to live right across the street from here and came more than I should of.  I miss the days when there wasnt a 20 minute wait for salsbury steak..  Food Network has ruined Sokolowskis, the Market and Melt for me..oh well, double edged sword..  This place has a pretty good beer selection and the cucumber/dill side is AWESOME!  Im glad to see they carry GLBC beers..some places in Tremont dont support the brewery right down the road.  Parking can be a pain, but I just walk down 11th.  Great in cold winter months...thats why I eat it AFTER thong season is over for me!!  ;)"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in on a random weekday afternoon. I think with the popularity of this place, that was the proper choice. 

The staff is personable and sort of reminded me of family just dishing out Sunday dinner. You grab a tray and load it up, then find yourself a table amongst the photos that line each wall, or near the fireplace in the back room. 

The pierogies were spot on, but I almost died after eating the golabki (stuffed cabbage.) It was so tender and delicious, and the tomato sauce was perfect, tangy and rich. It made me miss my grandmother. 

I love this place, and will make it a point to visit every time I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was in a mood for pierogis, so I searched for pierogies on Yelp and found this location. Given its incredibly high average rating with a concomitantly high number of reviews for Cleveland, I decided I would give this place a shot.

One thing that jumped out at me right away, was how unique this restaurant's location and ambience was. Sokolowski's is not a typical restaurant - it's almost like a small house on its own, tucked away in its own corner of Tremont. Inside, there are multiple rooms, each containing its own set of eclectic trinkets. The place I sat at was right next to a piano, complete with pianist. The food is ordered in a cafeteria style, though do not let that fool you - the quality of the food is far greater than any cafeteria I've been to.

One thing that surprised me, was just how big the portion was. I ordered the stuffed cabbage, with pierogies and green beans as my sides. The order also comes with a dinner roll and complimentary salad bar. If I had not skipped lunch, I highly doubt I would have been able to finish my meal. The pierogies were by far my favorite meal item, but the stuffed cabbage was excellent as well. A very good deal for the price I paid.

With the unique ambience, the background music, and the literal inn like location, I was strongly considering giving Sokolowski's a 5/5. However, for me, at the end of the day, the quality of the food is what I use to determine a restaurant's rating above anything else. Don't get me wrong - Sokolowski's food is excellent. However, it was not to such a high level that I felt I couldn't get this food anywhere else in the state, so I gave this place a 4 star rating. Don't let that deter you from giving this restaurant a try, though."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this great Cleveland family owned restaurant! The food and people are always amazing! Thank you"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices and nice atmosphere.Family owned which is important to me, don't like chain restaurants."}
{"text":"QUICK & DIRTY: 
If you're craving a hearty straight shot of excellent Polish cuisine served cafeteria-style with a side of Cleveland Polish history and culture, there's no better place to be.

PROS: 
Fun, cozy, historically and culturally rich ambiance.  Read: your Polish grandma's house meets meets Heorot Hall meets your junior high cafeteria.  If your junior high cafeteria also had a bar to furnish you with drinks while you waited in a line that wrapped around half the school.  Sweet kitschy-bordering-on-but-gently-skirting-creepy Polish knicknacks peek out of every corner in what basically looks like the inside of a viking mead hall.  A nice array of Polish beers!  And of course, Polish cuisine that'll leave you dreaming of it till your next visit.

CONS:
Super limited hours!  4 hour lunch on weekdays?  4 hour dinners on the weekends?  Polski, please.  Sokolowski's got a good thing going and boy do they know how to pump it into elite and exclusive territory.  The reservation and seating process is chaotic, at best, and with the amount of space you have to get around while you're inching your way up the cafeteria line wrapping around half the restaurant, is minimal.   I've seen Hollywood nightclubs with more standing room.  And with the limited hours, you ask, when is there downtime and possibly more space?  Probably never (note, pure but educated conjecture). 

TO DIE FOR: 
Sauerkraut - euphoric blend of pure savory and piquant tartness.  Who knew cabbage could taste this damn good?  First time I encountered savory sauerkraut and I don't think I could have it any other way anymore.

Pierogies - because, duh, you're in Cleveland.

Schnitzel - oh lordy, I never thought fried and breaded pork could melt in your mouth but I stand corrected. Dare I say, for the lack of a better analogy--pork that reaches the tenderness and exquisite flavor of a superb filet mignon?"}
{"text":"Lovely Polish restaurant tucked away in Cleveland. Servings the size of your face. Pierogis to die for. Salisbury steak was great too. Real mashed potatoes with the skin and amazing gravy. Great sauerkraut as well. A must stop if you're passing by."}
{"text":"I don't eat nearly enough Polish food but after dining at Sokolowski's, I am definitely all about pierogis now.

The restaurant looks like a little house on the outside but inside seems like your typical cafeteria. You start at the end of the line with your tray and pick the foods you want. Everything is mouthwateringly tempting so good luck trying to keep it all on one tray.

I ordered an entree of the salisbury steak with a side of the cabbage pasta and pierogis. The side of pierogis cost a bit extra but are SO worth it. The lady also threw in an extra pierogi for me. The salisbury steak was extremely flavorful as well. The cabbage pasta was a little bland but given the heaviness of the salisbury steak, they complemented each other very well.

There's a reason this little hole in the wall has the approval of Jimmy Fallon, Bill Clinton, and Anthony Bourdain. It sits right on the outskirts of downtown in a cute neighborhood called Tremont but is well worth the short trip out there."}
{"text":"Can't believe there are not more reviews.  As others have said this is a Cleveland institution.  Excellent and abundant dishes that you don't find everywhere, certainly not in SF."}
{"text":"Something about a true family-owned restaurant makes my heart smile. The workers can be heard chatting in Polish and the walls are covered with old family memorabilia. Not to mention the staff is ridiculously polite. It's so charming. (And also deceivingly large inside!)

Once you get passed the drinks there's a menu on the glass and the top right tells you the entrees for the day and they come with two sides. 

I'm rather petite and after filling up my plate and getting an extra side the woman behind the counter exclaimed- \"Good for you! I thought you were just going to get two perogies!\" Old Eastern European charm, I tell you! 

I'm not sure what they do to their sauerkraut but it was delicious. More creamy than vinegary but amazing, none the less. I ordered the chicken paprikash and it came as one big chicken breast covered in sauce and dumplings. The green beans were fairly standards but I felt like I needed a vegetable to combat my butter and starches. I also got to try the breaded pork and mashed potatoes- both were great! 


If you're looking for some Polish comfort food, look no further! Alas, even with lactaid, the copious amounts of butter, cheese, and sour cream put an unpleasant end to my lunch- but was it worth it? 100%"}

{"text":"Stopped in Cleveland during vacation, nothing of major interest to visit so we decided to checkout the food scene instead. Found this place on tvfoodmaps.com and decided to give it a go. You will not be disappointed! Served cafeteria style- The cabbage roll serving was HUGE and unbelievably delicious! My husband had the Salisbury steak, I was allowed to taste it, just as amazing! My daughter came for mashed potatoes and sauerkraut! My only regret was I didn't have enough room for pierogies! The staff are super kind and helped us get our trays to the table. This is a must try if coming to Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place.
Prepare to indulge in some polish comfort food. 
Everything is prepared well and always delicious.

{"text":"Please walk at least a mile after eating here. But they have the BEST pierogies I have ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"Take a look underneath the Freeway. SURPRISE! No homeless man, it's Sokolowski's University Inn!

Sokolowski's makes you feel like your in the basement of an old rich Polish families home. There's a mix n' match furniture setup, inconsistent lighting, a bunch of random family/cultural/patronage type stuff on the walls, and I recall the ceiling being pretty low. The service is very friendly and they treat about every customer like their a regular, so you can only imagine how fun it's gotta be to actually be a regular.

The food is served in cafeteria fashion. Which I like. They have a large selection, so it's great that you can dibble and dabble your way through their vast amount of choices. Of course, stick with some of the classics like pierogi's, anything pork, and get some cabbage based options. The rest is all up to you. 

Sokolowski's is a fun place to experience and you can see why they have established a lineage of followers."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Quaint old decor. Wonderful pianist. Large portions. Reasonable price. Old fashioned Polish food served cafeteria style, which makes their otherwise great food suffer a bit from from having been over steam a bit too long, but all the good points compensate for that. Very helpful staff, on the serving line and offering to carry my wife's tray for her."}
{"text":"Good food. Not as good as mom's. chicken paprikosh needs more paprika. Fun atmosphere and good bar."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait for this  classic cleveland eatery. Cafeteria style authentic polish delights. Super friendly wait staff, hot delish food, live piano player, fully stocked bar, best carrot cake ever...just like the sign says...come in as strangers, leave as friends."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's offers some of the best food you'll ever eat in Cleveland or anywhere else for that matter. In an age where many chefs are attempting to push the gustatory envelope with all manner of hideous delights (bone marrow pudding, anyone?), the fine folks at this old school Tremont haunt are just fine with the traditional Polish fare they've spent the last ninety years perfecting. Anyone visiting the Cleveland area would do well to stop in to sample the nostalgia but get there early as there is often a lengthy line. 

Food:

A grand and mouth-watering offering of virtually every comfort food under the sun. The pierogies are a must: served piping hot and perfectly cooked in a rich and heavy butter sauce. They are soft pillows of love, heavy enough to sate even the most peckish palate, but constructed of the finest ingredients so they don't give you that wretched 'food baby' feeling afterwards, no matter how heartily you indulge. The Chicken Paprikash is also exquisite and overflowing with flavor. You can't go wrong with any of the sides. The first bite of sweet potatoes reduced one diner to tears as he remarked, \"This is like munching down on Grandma's Soul, in the best possible way of course!\" All the dishes are perfectly seasoned and the portions are mighty, particularly with only a $10 price tag on average. It's all served Cafeteria style, as other reviewers have dutifully noted, so expect to wait in line. 

Decor:

An Old World Polish wonderland. You step in through the back door and are immediately introduced to the microcosm by way of the Polka music streaming down over the food line. It's rampant, upbeat stuff that will make your time in line feel like a fever dream wedding from 1925. Take a moment to put away your concerns of modern civilization (Honestly, I felt very strange even taking my phone from my pocket inside) and scope out each and every bit of magic this place has to offer by way of transportive, intricate decor. There are the requisite celeb portraits (and at least one oil painting of the owner with bees skirting mindlessly through his ears), as well as many adorable accent pieces, and more wood paneled walls than you could count if you had all day to devote to it. This place screams authenticity in its very bones. Slaves to modernity will surely be disappointed.

Service:

Excellent. You can tell these folks have to deal with more than a few geriatrics (soft food calls them like moths to a flame) so they are pretty okay with repeating the list of daily offerings, though there are ample menus scattered around as you walk in. They load your plate efficiently and even if you drop a roll into the gravy (as happened to one unlucky diner), they're apt to laugh it off as a beginner's mistake, and even hand over said roll with a special set of tongs seemingly allocated for the purpose. Elsewhere, a waiter with a fifty six tooth grin grabbed my lover's plate as he whisked us across the dim but not quite gloomy dining room (windows do not abound in the Polish Wonderland, though one is not in want of them) to a 'reserved' table right by the piano player. \"This is Tom,\" the waiter remarked, \"He's been here forever and he'll play whatever you want.\" Service indeed! Tom was an imposing, grinning, soft-eyed muse whose renditions of classics such as \"New York, New York\" left many diners clapping frantically. Tom's a lost vestige from another world content to finger the keys in the corner as he works his way through his nightly beer with mannered and leisurely aplomb. What a life, we kept thinking, what a world and what a life.

Closing: 

Here is a remnant kept lovingly alive from another world, a world few will ever see. Take a few hours to transport your mind and your belly. This place is vital. It pulses with history, life, and love."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this Cleveland icon is that they have chairs just like my Grandma used to have in her kitchen. Green Naugahyde with big brass rivets!  The food is just like what your grandmother made too if you hail from Northern Europe. Hearty, tasty and home made; they don't skimp on servings. It's a cafeteria line style place and then you eat in the dining room. Extra feature...great neighborhood bar to hang out at, even if you're not having dinner.  Any self respecting Clevelander needs to have been at least once"}
{"text":"My friends suggested that I try Sokolowski's for delicious and hearty stick to your ribs meal.   So far I have been here twice and will continue to be a patron of this nice family restaurant.

The food is served cafeteria style.  You get in line and grab your tray and utensils.  You will see a nice lineup of steam trays with yummy main courses and sides to choose from. 

On this visit I had the stuffed cabbage, pierogi and green beans. The stuffed cabbage was the best I ever had.  The red sauce marries perfect with it.  The portion was generous and I somehow was able to finish it.  The pierogis were wonderful as they are served in a butter and onion sauce. Yum! I had the side of green beans to make myself feel better.

Give Sokolowski's a try.  In addition to the stuffed cabbage I also recommend the Salisbury steak.  I would suggest the arriving at 11:30 AM for lunch to avoid the long line and easier parking."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and im never disappointed. The serving sizes are huge (they leave the to go containers right next to the register) but to be honest it's so good, it's hard to take home anyway! 

The stuffed cabbage is some of the best I've ever tried! Don't miss this gem, as it's usually not one of the dishes you can \"see\" but just about always available. 

Also, do yourself a favor, get the pierogis. You can get the pierogis as a side and if you looking to carb out then pick that over the mashed potatoes. If anything the potatoes are the weakest thing on the menu. 

It's well worth the wait and the atmosphere is wonderful too! Hang out for a while and get that 2nd helping of pierogis!"}
{"text":"Hate leaving a bad review but I agree. I was SO let down at this place and I don't care who or what famous people came walkin thru this door. You can't serve this kind of food and call it James Beard worthy, I'm sorry. 

Over cooked to no end egg noodles swimming in disgusting fat. Big and fat pierogis swimming in more fat. Would it kill you to give out some pickles to cut the fat? I felt like I needed hot sauce, or somethin so I don't puke trying to down all that butter."}
{"text":"You will feel like you're at home. Bring a large group and grub-great for a winter activity because the food is hearty. You need to get some pierogies and stuffed cabbage. I think you can skip the desserts and just load up on everything else. The fried walleye and perch are great too."}

{"text":"Cafeteria style food line...red tray, build your own utensil/napkin roll, slide down the line, fill your own soda, select your food and then seat yourself. Dining room is dimly lit and dated. Walls covered in sports and cultural memorabilia. All of it adds to the charm of this place, including the great location in Tremont. You can taste the blue collar Polish-American history that is defines parts of Cleveland. Unfortunately the food is just ok. I had Salisbury Steak, mashed with gravy, three pierogi and a soda all in for about $15. The Salisbury Steak resembled a softball sized clump of meatloaf and pierogi were middle road. Nothing else worth mentioning. Go for the history and check the box on this historical Cleveland spot. Don't expect a lot in the way of memorable food."}
{"text":"I love family owned community restaurants that have anchored a place forever.  This place really makes me miss the Polish restaurants I used to go to in Chicago.  I liked the vibe and decor a lot and was happy to stand in line and wait for my food.  Here's where the lack of a star comes in for me with this place.  They need to ditch the cafeteria line.  It isn't working.  The last several steps to the cash register were a nightmare for me as I watched my food become stone cold.  Credit cards and to go orders and last minute additions to people's tray are the hang up to this process and it's just not ok to make me eat cold pierogies as delicious as they are.  I would probably have been stoned by the patrons if I had suggested it there but why not table service!  Order what you want and have it delivered hot and fresh!  Short of that they should at least ban credit cards or get a runner for emergency needs because that cash lady had to do too much stuff.

I had breaded pork chops, corn, pierogie and a piece of banana cheesecake that I thought was going to be cake (more reason to skip the cafeteria line).  The pork chops had great flavor but were cold and dry.  Crazy because I saw them bring out a tray of them a couple minutes before I placed my order and that's why I picked them.  The corn was good for being held but was cold and the pierogies were excellent but tepid and really should be hot.  I didn't want cheesecake, I wanted cake so it was really pretty good but I was already disappointed.  I deserve better than this.  They have a great staff so why not put them to good use and find a way to serve me food that is hot and fresh?

I love Melman's Cafeteria in Ohio and have never had cold food there.  I don't have a problem with cafeteria food but you have to meet the challenges of running one and these folks aren't concerned enough with getting people to their tables once they've received their food."}

Get the kielbasa dinner with an old fashioned black cherry cola. Buy yourself a shirt. Bring your family, girlfriends, and boyfriends. Tip the employees well, because they work hard just to serve you authentic Polish-American meals. 

I highly suggest buying some pepcid for the aftermath. Just sayin'."}

{"text":"3 generations of Polaks came into this place and left full and quite satisfied. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, it's cafeteria-styled with polish homemade food. 

I throughly enjoyed the stuffed cabbage: one large roll, the sauce, thin in consistency, is much more oily than others that I have had [red chimney, and any of them made by someone in the family ]. However, it was a large portion and still tasty. It also came with 2 sides, I chose the mashed potatoes, tasted exactly like my dad's [neither a compliment nor an insult to them]. They're not very creamy or have any specific flavor, but they're homemade and authentic; I would order them again next time. 

The dinners come with 2 side dishes [which included during my visit, mixed beans, mashed sweet potatoes with a marshmallow topping, mashed white Idaho Potatoes, diced red potatoes, and a couple others], a roll, and the salad bar. The salad bar was self-service and 3-4 salads including cold beet salad ['just like Babka's !', my dad said], potato salad, and a green salad with iceberg, mixed greens, and romaine, and cole slaw. In addition to the traditional polish entrees featured in the Dinners, Grandpa enjoyed his Lake Erie Perch. 

I also ordered a side of 2 pirogies for $2. They were excellent [and the recipe is on their website: cool!] They weren't doughy, and were cooked perfectly with slight grill marks. They were filled with American Cheese and the amount of cheese was perfect for me, neither overwhelming nor gooey.

In addition to the restaurant, there's also a small rectangular bar with a few domestic drafts [LaBatt and the High Life] and bottled craft beers [a couple German and Polish Beers, Indigo Imp and Sierra Nevada; they are also available in the cafeteria line in an iced bucket] [I daydreamed that there would be a POC, Pride of Cleveland, in that beer bucket] . 

For dessert, we split a slice of carrot cake. It's $5, but it's very large, rich, buttery frosting with the crushed nuts on top, I found it delicious. 

Yeah, their hours aren't the most convenient [it doesn't really bother me], but I came before 6 PM for dinner and waited no more than 10 minutes. 

A group of 4 dinners and non-alcoholic drinks, along with the dessert came out to ~$60. 

What pushed it to a 5: the service. Although the place was slightly hectic, the busboys were helping those unable to carry their trays and all of the staff was quiet friendly."}
{"text":"polka lunch buffet! 
a big fat polish goodness 
-cafeteria. 

If you only want to eat one meal a day, this is the place. I think it is the ideal big lunch. Nobody leaves hungry, but the portions are not sooo huge that you get gardening tools to eat with instead of silverware like you do at a big box steakhouse. The menu is a combination of old school American standards such as Salisbury steak, pork chops, and mashed potatoes/gravy and eastern european heart stoppers such as kielbasi, perogies swimming in butter, cabbage and noodles, and kraut. Don't miss the soup if it is a cold wintry day. A pretty cool old gypsy pianist plays during the lunch hour. He reminds me of someone who specialized in \"collection of donations\" from an old mob flick, but his light touch on the piano add yet another blast from the (way far) past feel to the place. The crowd runs the gamut from blue hair to factory worker to exec to hipster. If you are entertaining someone from the west coast (coast, not side) they will think they walked onto a movie set. The line moves fast, so don't worry if a bus just let out.

Definitive Cleveland experience. 
The Sokolowski family rocks it.

Carry on."}
{"text":"This is the best home-cooked comfort in Cleveland! Family-owned restaurant with old-world Polish courses that taste better than mom ever made them (but don't tell her that!). 

Sokolowski's University Inn is an old gem at the north end of Cleveland's Tremont district that serves food in a cafeteria style restaurant. The whole place is a bit eccentric. Decor is certainly dated, but I wouldn't change a thing. I've often found my lunch party being treated to beautiful music from a pianist, but the atmosphere isn't formal at all. Once you walk in, go straight forward and pick up a tray. To your left, you'll see the specials on a chalk board. You'll have a chance to get drinks, desserts and salads ala carte before heading down to the serving area. 

Regular entrees are the salisbury steak, which is a softball-sized piece of seasoned hamburger with gravy and onions; the stuffed cabbage; pierogies; fish; and chicken paprikash. Everything I've ever tried here is delicious. I wish I could find some criticism, but I'm drawing a blank. Maybe less glutinous? If you're here on a diet eating one of the salads, I give you my deepest sympathies. 

Enjoy this restaurant, as these types of family restaurants become less and less common!"}
{"text":"A Cleveland staple.  I have never had anything that wasn't great.  Today the meatloaf was the best.  The pierogies are a must.  Cafeteria style lynch that does not dissappoint."}
{"text":"I have heard rave reviews about this establishment, so was itching to experience Sokolowski's University Inn. Unbeknownst to us, it is a \"cafeteria style\" restaurant- stand in line with tray, and point out what you want, pay the cashier, and find a seat in a casual dining room. There were about 60 people in line in front of us, a  \"church youth group\" from Connecticut- they were polite an urged us to cut in front of them- a very nice gesture, in my opinion!  I ordered the cabbage roll (after negotiating between that and the Salisbury steak) which came with 2 sides of your choice, a salad, and a buttered roll- I chose macaroni and cheese, and potato pierogi.  The cabbage roll's are \"monstrous\" in size and according to one of the employees is made with veal, pork, and ground beef.  I personally found the cabbage roll to be too savory for my liking-almost as if it is over-seasoned, and lacks the sweetness that I have come to enjoy from my grandmother's cabbage roll.  The macaroni and cheese was too bland, dry, and could have been creamier.  The pierogi was excellent- buttery, fried, and upon a bed of chopped sweet onions (served with a side of sour cream, of course! I ordered a slice of cheesecake, which really rounded out my meal- classic new york cheesecake recipe, complete with a lemon laced sour cream topping- very delicious!  My sister ordered the homemade bratwurst, and it is out of this world! 

The staff is efficient, friendly, and a man named \"Bernie\" (owner?) makes all of the stuffed cabbage daily. The lady tending the salad bar went out of her way to bring me blue cheese dressing which was not available at the salad bar.  Busboys are stationed at the cashier area to carry ladies' trays to their table, if needed.  I gave this review 3 out of the 5 stars because it was not the \"best\" polish food I have ever had- try Babushka's in Brecksville, Ohio; but it was pretty good. I will try this place again to taste the other entrees available."}
{"text":"My grandfather used to take me here as a young child after we would go to the west side market. Its alot of great food. The lunchline always offers great choices and there is a wide variety of old world alcohol and beer. I still go for the memories and the great food, cant wait to bring my polish girlfriend."}
{"text":"The line was long but friendly wholesome patient and a tradition.  Fantastic food that'll stick to your ribs for a day or two!  The stuffed cabbage was perfect and the pierogis just as good. We were really impressed with the attention to all the details by everyone on the staff and how well behaved the children were."}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times and have ordered almost everything off the menu.  There is never a disappointment in the food.  So glad we have this restaurant in Cleveland.  Authentic and a fun place to eat at."}
{"text":"I crave this place! Talk about Cleveland cooking....this typifies it. The oldest restaurant in Cleveland for a reason. My favorite is the Chicken Paprikash!!"}
{"text":"Not particularly good, which is a huge disappointment. I really love Polish cuisine."}
{"text":"Best food at good price. Cafeteria style so you get your food fast. I recommend  the stuffed cabbage"}
{"text":"We were in town after going to the Akron spring football game and decided to find Polish food.  We have ate Polish in Chicago, Hamtramack (Detroit) two different locations Bay City and Petoskey (Michigan).  We thought we ate the end all of Polish until we found this place.   

It is cafeteria style service and we all looked like deer in headlights when we walked in.  The bartender explained what to do and how it all worked.  We made our way to the food line and wow where we surprised.  

They offered cabbage rolls, meat loaf, Salisbury steak, pork chops, veal and maybe one or two more.  You get two sides that consist of a ton of choices, I picked mashed potatoes and green beans.  My wife picked chops, mashed and pirogies.  I also orders a dozen of pirogies as a side.    

There was 6 total people in our part and we had a huge variety of food.

We will always come back here when visiting Akron.  Cleveland and the University Inn will be a stop for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love this place. I gave it four stars because I want people to come here and support a place that takes a person back in time. I'm of Lithuanian heritage and my buddy that I was eating with was born in Poland. We know our Slavic food!  Everything was excellent and well spiced. Blandness is a common complaint about the cuisine... not a problem here. But honestly there are some flaws. If it weren't for the history and the atmosphere of a bygone era I would knock off a star. The food is terrific, don't get me wrong.  The weakness is in the very limited menu.  No fresh kielbasa? No sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi? I know I'm in the midwest... and the Bratwurst was terrific... but I'm a fresh kielbasa kind of guy.  No mustard on the tables?! No horseradish for my kielbasa?!  Again I love this place, I'm just nitpicking."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING FOOD!!!! There is no wonder this treasure has been in the same spot servicing home made good food for 92 years!! Had the Chicken Paprikash and the Pierogies WOW WOW WOW!!  Nothing fancy here... just good food!!!"}
{"text":"Took a bunch of out of towners here for a Cleveland experience for dinner last night. This restaurant couldn't have been more accommodating and Rob was super helpful. Everything we ate was excellent and my family enjoyed it immensely. All the reviews say it all from the perogies, chicken paprikash , and stuffed cabbage. It made my daughter's graduation weekend special and appreciate everything they did. A must dining place if you're ever in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good solid food for everyday folks. It's not as good as Grandma made it, but then again it is a cafeteria. The food ranges from average to very good. Nothing bad and nothing excellent. But if you like Polish-American food its worth the trip to the edge of Tremont. Fried fish, pierogi, sauerkraut, and all the usual suspects are featured, plus imported and domestic beer and piano music on certain days. The dining room looks like a real restaurant, but you must stand in line at the long counter to order you food and pay before you sit down to eat. Its friendly and the owners are local celebrities of sorts."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pierogis  I have ever had.  All of the food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. I would go out of my way to go here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Omg the food is amazing!!! Servings are huge and the atmosphere is really cool.  The only thing that I think needs to change is the music in the place. It's a Polish restaurant that tries to give you that Polish atmosphere but they play American pop/rock music in the dining area. They should play Polish music is in the background to give you that full affect. Besides this, the place is great!!! A definite stop if your in from out of town like we were!!! Pierogis!! Pierogis!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I am a dyed in the wool Cleveland Hts dude and me and my friends eat in every new/old/trendy restaurant in town...so let me tell you this Sokolowski's is so near and dear to all of our hearts! From it's location in the Tremont neighborhood on a bluff overlooking the Cuyahoga river, the Flats & downtown...across one bridge and underneath another...It is just so quintessentially Cleveland if you can't appreciate just the trip over here & the location...then get outta here! 
The food is exactly what you would expect from a ca. 1920 Polish cafeteria style old school family restaurant...food is 4.85 the atmosphere is 5.00.
BTW why hasn't anyone mentioned the cod? So what I get is the baked cod swimming in so much butter it tastes like lobster, 2 sauerkraut pierogis, a kielbasa, some Polish beer & the free salad bar...I mean who could want for more happiness?
So since you are there please check out the really cool Tremont and or Ohio City / W 25th St neighborhoods for some culture & fun!
Nothing is perfect, just be open and smile and live a little! We have a good quality of life here in Cleveland and this is one of the reasons!"}
{"text":"Fast service
Good food
Great service
So much food
Don't come here if you are on a diet. 
We must have arrived early because there wasn't much of a line, when we left the line was wrapped around the restaurant... this was at lunch time. 
It is cafeteria style, we walked right past the beautiful salads and straight for the perogies, 5 of use shared the big plate and then each had our own meals. With drinks and beer it was under $60. 
The food was amazing, and we all had leftovers. 
Check it out if you are in the area. 
Bonus is you can walk over to the big Cleveland sign and get your picture with the city scape behind you, maybe before you gorge on the delicious food."}
{"text":"They call this the place that Clevelanders eat.  It's legit.  Go there.

Sokolowski's is uniquely fantastic.  People line up around the bar to grab a tray, some sides (I had the pickled beets and cucumber salad), a beer or soda and then are introduced to the daily menu consisting of Eastern European food.  You tell the server what main dish you want.  I had the Golabki - stuffed cabbage.  My cousin had the Chicken Haluski.  You could also get salisbury steak, sausage or Kielbasi, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, a variety of vegetables, and/or (of course) Perogies.

This food is terrifically home made and as you eat you can't help but close your eyes and feel like your mother is Polish and just served you dinner at home."}
{"text":"I've been here around five times now and it has always been stellar. All food is served cafeteria style, they usually have around a dozen different choices. My favorite thing that I have had has been the pork chops, they are so tender that you can cut them with a fork!

Come on the weekends for free salad bar with entree!"}
{"text":"Such a glorious and fantastic place. I'm 100% Polish and feel right at home here. The food is amazing, generous portions, and love the cafeteria-style delivery. The chicken paprikash is drool-worthy and every single type of pie is amazing. Make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"Delicious Lunch for two under $20with enough leftover for dinner? Count me in!

We came here Saturday night for a quick dinner... Or so we thought. The line went throughout the whole restaurant and was easily 150 people deep. We left discouraged, but dying to come back at a better time. We tried again today for lunch and walked right in with no wait hurray!

You walk in and get your tray and silverware very old school cafeteria style. The nice lady behind the counter explained to us that you pick one entree and two sides. I went with the potato pierogis with cabbage & noodles and green beans. My boyfriend got the stuffed cabbage. 

The cabbage and noodles I could eat everyday if calories meant nothing, but they do. They tasted a tad on the sweeter side, as did everything. But sweet in a good way! The Pierogis were great and the cabbage was the size of my head, seriously.

This was one of those meals where everything taste so good that you barely say two words to your dining partner. But I do remember him saying \"oh wow, even the corn is great. It pops in your mouth!\" This made me laugh."}
{"text":"Food is great perogies are amazing. Reminds me of highschool cafeteria style dinner. Place gets packed"}
{"text":"This place gets two stars only because it has a cool atmosphere in a faded from former glory kind of way. They are also I guess honest when they say it is food like your grandma cooked, that is if your grandma worked in a prison cafeteria. I appreciate Polish food, have eaten in many Polish places, and Polish does not mean it needs to be greasy, overboiled and taste like punishment for causing a fight in the prison yard. Everything here was bland as wallpaper paste and the place just seemed like a place that could be a great spot if they actually cared and we're not resting on their long faded laurels..."}
{"text":"This was a very delightful stop on a recent trip to Cleveland.  I had a cabbage roll, noodles, and perogies.  I liked the perogies most of all.  The prices were a little high for cafeteria style, but the portions were huge.  I recommend splitting an entrée and purchasing an additional side or two."}
{"text":"Sorry y'all. So apparently this place is a 'Cleveland institution,' but I was sadly unimpressed. My mom and I came on a Saturday evening and we were ridiculously excited, there was a nice couple behind us who kept telling us how great everything was during our hour wait. We couldn't believe an hour wait had already formed when we got there 5 minutes before they opened, which actually added to our excitement. So we finally got through the line, and we decided on the breaded pork chops and the chicken paprikash (we were going to get pierogies but the paprikash looked ah-may-zing!) and my sides were pierogies and cabbage and noodles. The pierogies were very good, the cabbage and noodles was bad- it was buttered noodles with a rare bite of flavor- and the pork chop was a bit crusty on the bottom from sitting in the pan and soggy on top from the steam. The chicken paprikash was the saddest of them all though- because it had no flavor!!!!!! Seriously, if you had blindfolded me and had me taste it I could not have told you what it was! We split a slice of cake for dessert which was super good, but for a $35 dinner, I didn't think it was worth it, even though I was really hoping for a great dinner. The food was flavorless and really, regardless of the cool, dingy decor, isn't that what's most important?"}
{"text":"I think I showed up at closing time.  I had the chicken papadash which was bland.  The perogies were good.  There was another couple there and they were very annoying so I boxed my meal up and left.

I am glad I tried it but wouldnt rush back."}
{"text":"I came upon this place in an unusual way, as well - I was taking a Diversity in America class a couple of years ago and in addition to visiting Cleveland's Ukrainian Museum and heading to lovely Little Italy, we came as a class to Sokowlowski's University Inn in Tremont.

The cafeteria-style buffet line is a happy trap, because you see everything and want to eat pretty much everything.  From the pierogis, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa & brats to the lengthy lineup of delicious desserts (I had a piece of creamy cheesecake, YUM), the selection is overwhelming, and the mouthwatering smells mingling in the air are enough to inflate even the tiniest appetite.  The seating setup is fun, with some smaller tables and some large multi-seaters.  There are photos all around the room of famous people who have come to dine on their famous Polish cuisine, and rightfully so - they do a great job here of providing an incredible dining experience.  I mean, I was technically in class, but it didn't feel like it at all - who cares about an upcoming final when you're stuffing stuffed cabbage in your mouth?  Delish.

As a side note, Sokolowski's was recently featured on the Travel Channel's No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain; though I feel Bourdain could have chosen some better Cleveland companions than Skyline Chili (WTF?) Sokolowski's definitely deserved their moment in the sun."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style restaurant that serves generic desserts first but don't let that fool you! The real meal begins after the soda fountain and their perogies are amazing!! I also had their stuffed cabbage which was surprisingly good too! Was able to eat family style and you definitely get your money's worth... doesn't look like a lot but you get full fast!"}
{"text":"OMG...the Pork Schnitzel is out of this world good! I usually have gotten the Salisbury steak. Glad I tried something different. Have had the meat loaf there before and that was super tasty.
Took an out-of-town friend there as well, and she couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit so I know Eastern European food. I've never had any better than this place. I also really enjoyed the local character.

The line at 4pm on a Saturday was formable, but worth it. I really enjoyed the kielbasa, and pierogi but the red cabbage and apple pie were off the charts.

I only wish I had the stomach capacity to also try the stuffed cabbage and wiener schnitzel - they looked terrific."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland staple and come on you, have to try it. You go through a cafeteria line to get your food and there is tons of home cooked food. I order the pierogi and they were good, but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I am so into Polish food, like I might actually be an Eastern European peasant at heart. For example, I've never really been into dumplings, the food of my people (my actual people, the Chinese), but pierogis? Chewy, doughy, filled with things that are not ginger/scallions-related. Pierogis are a revelation. 

The line was almost out the door when we arrived here on a Saturday around 5pm, but it went by quickly due to the cafeteria-style efficiency. I got the stuffed cabbage, which was basically meatloaf, wrapped in a cabbage leaf. I know that sounds not so appetizing, but it was so soft and tender (is tender really the appropriate word here), that I didn't have to chew. 

Which will be perfect for when I fully (d)evolve into peasanthood and lose all my teeth."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having authentic Polish food, and I have fallen in love. The stuffed cabbage is a MUST HAVE. The pierogis are AMAZING. The wait is long, but it is so worth it. Cafeteria-style eatery. This place is great! If you're ever in the Cleveland area, you have to stop in and try it out!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ethnic food you can get in a restaurant!  The pierogi were almost as good as my own home made.  The stuffed cabbage was terrific, as are their Stuffed Peppers and they are both huge.  The atmosphere is so neat with all of their photos, and I just loved the cafeteria style service.  The staff is all wonderful, friendly and very helpful.  I heard about them on \"No Reservations\" and they really live up to their reputation.  Maybe I'll share my potato filling recipe with the.  NAH, no one should make Pierogi like mom ;)"}
{"text":"I most recently ate at Sokolowski's on Friday, October 19, 2012.  I was there with a group of about ten people.  The line moved quickly, the service was fantastic, and the food was perfect for a rainy night in Cleveland.  

I had the kielbasi, with sauerkraut, and two pierogies.  I skipped the salad bar, and roll.  Each item was cooked to perfection.  My only complaint would be that the portion of sour cream provided (at a surcharge of $0.50) was not nearly enough for my taste.  For dessert I had a slice of coconut cake.  It was incredibly fluffy, but the frosting was the satin variety (the type that has that Cool-Whip taste to it), of which I am not a fan.  

The busboys/servers were very attentive, helping carry heavy trays to the table, and bringing us boxes and bags for leftovers.  They also had a very pleasant demeanor, which is so important in the service industry.

I see the Chicken Paprikash and Carrot Cake on the horizon."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sokolowski's for the last fews years as an undergraduate student. Overall, this is a very casual and fun atmosphere that provides commendable service all at affordable prices ($12-$19). 

As for food, it is cafeteria style where you select you fresh entrée directly from the line. Each dinner includes two sides, a salad bar and dinner roll. If you come, you must try their homemade pierogi as either a side or by the dozen (hands down my favorite item here). For an entrée, their Chilean grilled fish, chicken paprikash, or their breaded pork chops are all excellent choices. For desert, I highly recommend their carrot cake, which is filled with a cream cheese icing on the inside."}
{"text":"A buddy and I went here as I was showing him the best of Cleveland. We explored the Tremont area and dropped by for a mid afternoon lunch. 

A few things you should know... There is little parking directly next to the restaurant, but you can park along the streets nearby. Most of the people don't speak English very well, but it won't make it any harder to get a great lunch. There won't be anyone up front to show you to a seat. Just walk all the way to the back and go to the cafeteria style food area. That's exactly what it is. Pick out your desserts first, snag a drink, and then pick out a main dish and two entrees. It comes out a little pricey, but you get A LOT of food, and most of it tastes like home. You better get some perogies. I had some tastey pork, but it was a little dry. 

The place is very casual and a large number of the people eating there are regulars. It's definitely an older crowd, but that's probably because the whole place is run by the same family. The walls are covered floor to ceiling with anything and everything from pictures to stuffed ducks. Everything about Sokolowski's says \"comfort\". The food, the people, the decorations... I'll be down here again to try some of the cakes. Definitely worth checking out on a day to Tremont!"}
{"text":"An hour wait in line for very average food. We finished eating in 10 minutes. Now we're uncomfortably full, like a belly full of lead. I had potato pancakes, pierogis and carrot cake. Just meh. I don't see what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Wear your stretch pants lol! I can't control myself--I'll take one of everything! It taste like going to my grandmothers house for dinner as a child. Such a Cleveland staple and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Sokolowski's is my go to when people come to visit from out of town. Nothing says Cleveland more than Eastern European food served cafeteria style. My suggestion is to go early as 1. the line gets very long and 2. they often run out of the specials, ESPECIALLY during the winter. You will know you are somewhere amazing when you see all the photos of famous people who have stopped in over the years. The portions are huge, the atmosphere is really quaint and old fashioned (including a piano player in the corner that has been playing there for years). If you have not been here, please make sure you take a trip to this special Cleveland staple. I guarantee you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I will tell you truthfully, Sokolowski's is really not that good. The actual food, I mean if you lined it up for a taste test, would not take home any prizes if you stripped it over all the butter, and all the ambiance and history that comes with this dining experience."}
{"text":"My only complaints about Sokolowski's are that the line was absurdly long which, I suppose, is a testament to how good this place is, and that the food was a mite greasy, the pierogies especially.

Other than that, though, this place serves up some mighty delicious Polish comfort food. I was able to try the kielbasa, beef stroganoff, and some sort of baked fish, all of which were top notch. The pierogies were also tasty, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was essentially inhaling grease while eating them. We capped off our meal with blueberry pie and red velvet cake, both of which were very good.

Sokolowski's is an enjoyable dining experience if you have the time to wait in line. The decor and atmosphere are very, shall we say, authentic in their kitschiness and overall Polishness. A great choice for natives and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people are so crazy about this place. Maybe I was just not able to comprehend the complexity of polish food, but really, I don't see what's so special about it. All the food were in those trays that were warmed by hot water underneath them, meaning they are not cook to orders. The sour cabbage I ordered tasted just like some water boiled cabbage with some sour flavor. The sausage was good, but I don't get why I can't get a similar one just from a super market. The food serving process was also like a dining hall where you wait in line, and they will dump the food you pick on their plate then pass the plate to you. Then you pay, sit down, then get some salad from a salad bar, which only has some lettuce and tomatoes and some random dressings. I'm not sure how fresh those salad was either. The atmosphere of the restaurant is interesting. Very interesting decoration, but the whole set up and dining experience just seem too cheap to me. Nothing really struck my eyes.

In fact, I just talked to a polish dude today, and he's been there too. He said he didn't like it either because the food is very americanized and too oily. And i was like: psh please i saw no oil. it's all boiled. I guess that's the difference between asian and polish huh."}
{"text":"Amazing food, worth the wait in line. Heard about this place for years from my fiancée who is from Cleveland and was finally able to go last year. I'll be visiting Cleveland again for business and will definitely be stopping by for dinner!"}
{"text":"Really great bratwurst! Mostly cafeteria like, but food for a quick authentic polish eat in tremont"}
{"text":"First let me say I made reservations to University Inn a month before my wife's birthday. The tables had reserved on them however our table was in use and not marked reserved like some others were. We arrived close to 6PM on Saturday May 19th. Holding presents for my wife's birthday. One of the employees had us go to a reserved table only to remove us from that table for a party that showed up after 6PM. Finally we get a table not until 7 PM. Strike 1. My wife wanted Salmon and asparagus for her birthday dinner all out sorry may you order something else as she stood in line strike 2. I stood in line wanting the mussels in a boel served with bread all out of that can you order something else the staff says. STRIKE 3. Needless to say I couldn't post there food because of these problems what restauraunt runs out of this much food. Don't recommend this restauraunt stay away. Will not be going back there ever.  Being nice by giving one star. Because only I do like the Tremont area. Just won't be eating at University Inn period."}
{"text":"Don't let the weird, old look of the place or the cafeteria style serving fool you. This place is a gem! It's difficult to find good pierogi's. Theirs are delish! I also love their Chicken Paprikash. Once they even had a paprikash gravy for mashed potatoes! SO good. Don't bother with the cucumber salad or the other cold sides. They're not very good. The star is the hot, polish food. I'd highly recommend this place! Super Yum!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Sokolowski's so I had to come and try it out. Came here twice. First time I had the Chicken Paprikash with a side of Pierogi's. I thought everything was amazing, despite the price being a little steep. Second time I ordered the stuffed cabbage while my friend ordered the meatloaf. Was not a fan of either. Thought the stuffed cabbage meat was a bit bland for my liking. Sampled my friend's meatloaf and it was the same. 

I'm not a huge fan of Polish food, but I did enjoy the Chicken Paprikash and Pierogi's. Also I felt a bit claustrophobic in the house like restaurant. I'll probably come back one more time to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Sokolowski's will make you fat with its delicious delicious pierogies and huge portions. The food is tasty and you will overstuff yourself, so try to have self control. 

We arrived about 5 minutes before opening by accident without realizing, but it was the best mistake we made. Several other cars were also parked waiting for this place to open, and the line got long very quick.  This didn't slow them down too much, though, since it is cafeteria line style service.  As you are in line, it was very tempting to grab everything they had. I am sad that I didn't get to try everything while in Cleveland. If I could do my trip to Cleveland again, I would eat all my meals here so I could try everything.

We had the dozen pierogies (I was only able to eat 6, so I packed the rest and ate them a few hours later, and they were still delicious). It comes with a side, so I chose the potato pancakes, which I was less a fan of.  While it was savory and tasted like potatoes, it didn't punch enough flavor for me to eat when everythign else was so amazing.  My fiancee ordered the fried fish (cod) and IT WAS THE BEST FRIED FISH i have ever had. The better was light and fluffy, but so perfectly crispy. I think it was the special that day, and I saw a schedule on their wall, so I would check to see if they have it that day if you are craving fish and chips. 

The two large plates of food, multiple sides, and 2 sodas came out to about 20 bucks, which we thought was a great deal for the quality of food and the amount of food we got. Sokolowski's deserves its reputation for serving great food."}
{"text":"With Cleveland's strong Polish immigrant heritage, I think this or another great Polish restaurant is the place to eat when visiting the city. The pierogies were some of the best I've had (I would say the best, but I ate some from a mind-blowing food truck in Indy recently). Also had some potatoes and mac n cheese, which weren't bad, but the pierogies are what you go to Sokolowski's for. The portion sizes were huge, so I was stuffed to bursting by the end of the meal. My mom and I split a piece of cheesecake (also quite good), but if I'd realized how much food the rest of the meal would be, I probably would've just stuck with the pierogies!

I also love the old-fashioned decor inside - the walls are covered in articles, sports memorabilia, and trinkets, which makes the restaurant feel very homey."}
{"text":"Ok, 1st things 1st, you want to eat at a certain time, show up at least half an hour to an hour earlier. They do take reservations for groups of 8 or more. 

Now, about the food; it's cafeteria style, and dinners get 2 (small-ish, depending) sides, otherwise everything is à la carte. My hubby and I each always get a dessert, a soft drink, and entrees. We get out for about $50. That's more than what we ordinarily spend for one meal, but the food is outstanding. Handmade, in house recipes just like grandma (if she's of eastern or cereal European decent) used to make! 
My faves: pierogi and Salisbury steak. Be sure to check out the stuff on the walls; lots of local history and hometown celebrities depicted and photographed there."}
{"text":"Great, authentic, Polish comfort food served by very friendly staff cafeteria-style amidst great ambience reminding me of ethnic Grandma's house. This is primarily a lunch place.  Make sure they are open before you venture over here.  Also, parking may be tight (or make nearby arrangements, given the size of the restaurant and the crowd)."}
{"text":"Starch+Potato+Cheese+BUTTER = the best Perogies 

Sokolowski's is not a place to eat if you are on a diet. But the perogies are just amazing. 

Old school \"cafeteria\" style. Hearty food that no one will feel hungry just like what eating suppose to be? 

Beer on tap or in bottles either Polish or from local breweries.

Anthony Bourdain would have agree with \"No Reservations\" that this is what me and Michael Symon consider as \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\"!"}
{"text":"Let me describe every experience I've ever had at Sokolowski's, as the same thing happens every single time:

I'm standing in line with my dining companion(s), eagerly awaiting my turn when it happens: I spot ONE piece of chocolate silk pie on the dessert shelf. I quickly count how many people are ahead of me in the cafeteria line and start mentally calculating the odds of one of the other, less deserving, people in line taking it. 

Amazingly, person after person passes up that last slice of chocolate pie, opting instead for fluffy coconut cream pie, carrot cake or, insanely, Jello. Dummies! 

I start to get anxious and excited the closer I get... Only three more competitors and I'll be in the home stretch... Two more and the pie is mine!! By the time I grab a tray and silverware, I'm pretty much in a full-on fatty panic. 

It's almost my turn! OMG! I'm going to finally get that delicious creamy, chocolately, fluffy goodness, it's all mine, it's all mine!!! And then...

The motherf*cker in front of me snatches it. 

EVERY SINGLE TIME. 

Dejected, I'll end up consoling myself with a mountain-high plate of starchy, buttery goodness like pierogies or mac and cheese. And, every single time, after I'm barely able to make a dent in it but still so full that I'm about to burst through my clothes like the Incredible Hulk, I am relieved that I \"passed\" on dessert."}
{"text":"Great home style Polish and German cuisine.  Cafeteria style restaurant. Very economical and great service. The perogi were good and the pork schnitzel was delis and tender. Visiting from California and would come back when I make it back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"All old world food cooked home made style -no shortcuts! Chicken Paprikash served over dumplings ( not bread or noodles or spaetzle). The real thing. Flat Iron steak - tender and not over-seasoned. Real mashed potatoes.  Salad and vegetables served as well. Most restaurants do not have anything green back in the kitchen.

Anything I have ever had here is delicious. All servers and order takers were super nice. 
Food is served thru a cafateria like line. But everything is fresh and hot.  

We had to wait about an hour in line, before we actually sat down to enjoy our meal.  It is well
worth it.  There is plenty to see - pictures on the wall. All wooden walls that had a house/cabin feel. A warm feeling. An excellent view of the city once you reach the bar area!
Full bar with some good regular beer taps.  No lite this or that or quadruple IPAs.  Just real beer...Polish, Labats.

The price is right for the quaity, value and service.  Please leave a tip- they deserve it!"}
{"text":"The stuff that road trips are made of.  I say that because, if I lived here and ate here more often, I'd die, either of joy or massive, sudden arterial cloture, or both.
It's not like a Chicago Polish buffet -- it's cafeteria style, you get an entree and sides.  I got the to-die-for pierogies, which seem to be braised or browned or -- whatever, they're huge and juicy -- and vegetables and kraut.  And then I just had to get more kraut, and the rice pudding, which was huge and had probably been fried in lard, I thought this might be my last meal but it was so delicious I would die very, very happy.
Never been in a place like this before -- built in 1923, it's modeled on a Polish hunting lodge or something -- dark, cypress-like wood -- and overlooks the Mordor-like Industrial Valley (see separate review).  The place is covered in Cleveland memorabilia, some of it wonderful (like the Browns teams of the '50s) and some of it not so wonderful (like pictures of Father Coughlin speaking).  In the cafeteria line, you can get various drinks that will kill you, from their special Green Apple Soda (which is greener than Green River) to Baltika 9 beer (If you've ever been to Russia you know that shit will FUCK YOU UP).  On the way out, they have really cool Sokolowski's T-shirts which they of course gave us a discount for and thanked us earnestly for buying (Why is everybody in Cleveland -- shoot, everybody in Northern Ohio -- SO NICE?)"}
{"text":"I'm polish, Hungarian, and german so I have mixed opinions of this place. I prefer the Hungarian way of making some of their dishes but if you want a legit experience of eastern European cuisine this is the place to go. Its awesome that you can try so many different dishes and desserts as well. I recommend the fish and the perogis if they have them."}
{"text":"Wow..just WOW!! Absolutely delicious!!! So happy we found this place!! You definitely need to eat here. Make sure you have a pierogi and a slice of chocolate pie!! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the place is amazing. It has that old time charm and warmth that only comes from a place that has been well loved and maintained over many years. The staff is very friendly, if a little brisk. They are willing to help you make a decision but really, just get whatever they have on special that day because its sure to be delicious. The inside is a little maze like but its easy to figure out once you look around once or twice.

The main entrance door is next to the road near the river. it has an awning and few steps up to the door. There is a back entrance but that makes finding the line rather confusing. However, if you are in a wheelchair, use the back door because its more accessible. Be warned, the tables are rather close together so it may be a little tricky to navigate.

My family of 5 went here at around 4pm on a Saturday. There was a line back by the bar but that's par for the course. The line moves super fast due to the competent and efficient staff behind the cafeteria style counter. We ended up all getting the Chicken Paprikash, Mac 'n' Cheese, and Pierogis. We also shared one piece of lemon and one piece of apple pie. All of it was absolutely divine. I try chicken paprikash every chance I get from every restaurant I can and this place hit the ball out of the park. By far the best Polish food I've ever tasted.

I think a lot of the charm and quality comes from the owner himself. We saw him as we were eating. He seems to be a constant in the kitchen and out front. His snowflake pants and crocs convinced me he is in fact a true chef/cook. I've never seen a cook in pajama pants who didn't know his way around a kitchen. Seriously, watch 'No Reservations' and you'll know what I'm talking about. But really, he seemed like a great down to earth guy and his food is out of this world."}
{"text":"I like it automatically because of my Polish heritage. My Grandma is a pretty bad cook. She would have dirty, weathered hands, sometimes with dirt under her nails from working out in her garden. She would always grab food with those hands and slop some food on your plate and make you eat it. If not, you would be ridiculed, called fussy, and be compared to your good cousins who would eat anything thrown in front of them. Her golumpki (stuffed cabbage) was way better than Sokolowski's. I would eat that golumpki from her gnarled hands any day of the week over here. Also, you can't go here any day of the week because the hours are so limited. The pierogies are also just decent. If you are not from a Polish family, go to Sokolowski's, it will be the closest thing to having an authentic meal. I like the picture of Pope John Paul because there are tons of pictures of him all over my Grandma's place. She has a bunch of little statuettes of him and other saints strategically placed throughout the house. I should Yelp on her house because that is what this review turned into. I love you Grandma. Rest in peace."}
{"text":"Except for the line, which you just have to deal with and anticipate, this place did not disappoint on any level. The food, portions, atmosphere, and staff were great. Not to be missed on a visit to Cleveland, as are the pierogies and chicken paprikash."}
{"text":"Even if you aren't a huge fan of Polish food, go for the experience. You won't find many places like this. Cafeteria style with any option of food to view and choose from, count me in. This is not only a yummy restaurant but a landmark for the City of Cleveland. If you are on a diet, maybe sit this one out but if you are hungry and love food get in line!"}
{"text":"Really love the old school feel to this place. Old people with foreign accents serving you way too much food gives you a \"Sunday at grandma's\" feel.  Wood interior is awesome...makes you feel like your at a ski resort. And the view of Cleveland from the back parking lot is actually better than you think."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me. I lived in Tremont for 25 years. The best people who create the best food. I'm honored to taste anything they make. Pierogi, mashed potatoes, fish choices are amazing on Fridays. Lunch on a winter day by the fire. You can never go wrong by eating here. Now I'm starving."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the atmosphere top-notch. We often meet extended family here for dinner: being a cafeteria, it is easy for various subgroups to run a separate tab, even come and go as they please. They handle large groups with aplomb. It is like the anti-chain, anti-hipster destination. Nice array of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I'm a healthy-eating vegetarian so of course I wasn't crazy about the food, BUT my grandma WAS. She is Hungarian/Ukranian and she was in her glory. I loved the decor.... soooo backwards.... reminded me of York Steak House which use to be out in Southland. The staff seemed bothered rather than welcoming. Strange."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland landmark. The cafeteria style, the food, and the ambiance is absolutely amazing! So much history in the restaurant that looks like a little house under a bridge. The hours are sometimes a little inconvenient, however when they are open, everything is on point!"}
{"text":"Was traveling to Cleveland and heard this was a place to try! 

The good: the potato pancakes and pirogies (maybe the best I have ever had) were great! 

The chicken prapeikash was good, sauce excellent but the chicken was a little dry. 

Had a bite of my husband's carrot cake and it tasted good! 

All in all a fun place to try out!"}
{"text":"Loved the old world charm and old world dishes.  Proud to be Polish.  Great selection in a family style atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! I had the Salisbury steak soo good!! Looking forward to trying everything else!! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great pierogis!!"}
{"text":"This is most definitely a family oriented restaurant. The place is actually huge, which was deceiving to us cause we didn't see the additional dining room in the back.

Between the two of us, we tried: chicken paprikash - great. Baked beans - great. Slaw - great. Salad bar - pretty standard fare. Crab cakes - great. And can't forget the pirogies - also great. Only thing not great were the green beans - soggy and obviously canned.

Prices were pretty reasonable, what I'd expect for a dinner of that size. Main thing we didn't like - the line. It was suuuuper slow to move and the line was HUGE. We were in line for probably 40 mins. Granted, it was a Saturday evening and it seemed like half the place was packed for this one lady's 90th birthday."}
{"text":"Can I say this place is a little bizarre without offending???  Reminds me of going to my grandma's house, maybe her basement, if she lived in Cleveland and was Polish. 
First, it seems like it's a bit off the beaten path, but I'm not too familiar with the metro Cleveland area.  I pull up and was thinking there was going to be a line out the door for lunch.  There wasn't... but it took about 15 minutes on the inside to make it through to the register in the cafeteria style fashion.  
There's nostalgic \"no frills\" decor on the inside replete with stadium seats and pics of music stars with the owners.  Plenty of food, but about 4 major meal choices once inside (short of the sausages).
I had the salisbury steak, kraut and perogies.  Steak was great, lots of gravy, kraut was tasty, perogies were just average at best.  But what a pile of food.  The steak was softball sized.  For some reason, i thought I should have some pie... blueberry.  I rolled out of there.
This is homestyle and good at that.  
Strangest moment.... there's a guy playing piano in the back room where I sat.  Didn't seem to go with the whole vibe... but what do I know."}
{"text":"First off, it's cafeteria style and you select your dessert first.  Secondly, the decor may remind you of your grandparents basement.  I may be severely biased as my grandparents were both Czech/Bohemian and from Cleveland - but, the whole thing is perfect.  Summary:  generous portions, great pirogies, a hodge-podge selection of good and great beer, families of all ages filling the place."}
{"text":"I find myself unusually nervous about reviewing Sokolowski's University Inn.  It just seems to be so venerated and beloved by so many.  But I'll be honest as my experience wasn't the best.  My husband and I visited recently on a cross country trip and we were excited to try a Polish restaurant while in Cleveland.  We did read some reviews beforehand, so we understood it was cafeteria style and there might be a long line and other minor eccentricities.  No problem, we thought.  When we arrived, there was no line at all, but we were confused by the dessert section coming first, so we attempted to enter from the other direction and were met by a confused and somewhat angry dishwasher who had difficulty communicating to us that we were heading in the wrong direction.  While that was certainly not his fault, it was disconcerting as a first impression.  We went back the original way and fell into line with our trays.  

The food items were not marked and there was no posted menu.  There were a few sheets of copy paper taped in various sections, either printed out from a Word program or written on with pen, to indicate pricing and menu items available.  My husband was most excited to try the scrod and they told us they hadn't had it in months.  By that time, there was a line forming and we made some quick picks and had to ask what everything was, so we tried to just go with whatever looked good.  We got kielbasa, chicken paprikash, pierogies, and green beans.  Overall, the taste was okay but not mind blowing.  My chicken seemed undercooked (pink center I could not eat), which was the worst offense here, but it was too busy by then to make any changes and to be honest I felt a little intimidated.  The sauce was good, at least.  

When I used the ladies restroom, an employee of Sokolowski's was on her way out and she screamed that I'd scared her.  I apologized twice and she kept repeating \"you scared me\" very angrily.  It was crazy, especially from an employee who was coming out as I was about to enter? I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome here. 

We were shocked to find that these authentic pierogies tasted, to both of us anyway, exactly like Mrs. T's from the supermarket freezer.  I'm sure they are far better quality but I expected to taste a marked difference.  Also, the green beans were 2/3 bright green and 1/3 brown. I don't even know what else to say.  Two stars for my experience here, and hoping it was just an off day all around for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! Remember all the carb-a-licious meals you babushka used to make? Yeah. They have all those and then some. Great atmosphere with many photos capturing Cleveland's history. Feels just like home!"}
{"text":"This place is Polish food heaven. 

Pierogies! Sauerkraut! Kielbasa! Meatloaf?!  Yes, meatloaf.

Sokolowski's has been on my Cleveland restaurant list for a while now and I finally got to try them out during my last trip here. We came on a Friday night after 7:00 and I read how the lines could be out the door, but we must have arrived at a good time cause the lines were pretty short and everything moved quickly. I was so excited to try their pierogies, so I went with the pierogi dinner with sauerkraut and green beans for my sides. The pierogies were everything I thought they could be. Nom nom.

So while I went with the pierogies, most of my friends (and my husband) ended up going with the meatloaf. I had a few bites from my husband's plate... and oh my god! I think their meatloaf deserves just as much recognition as their pierogies. It was really just as good as my mom's. 

Their beer and soda selections were a plus too!

Basically if you love pierogies (and meatloaf!), Sokolowski's should definitely be on your Cleveland bucket list."}
{"text":"The absolute best!!! I have never had a bad meal here. The staff are the friendliest. The food is served cafeteria style. They have desserts and drinks on the line then you get to the good stuff. They always have a few of the staple foods (breaded pork chops, Salisbury steak, stuffed cabbage, chicken paprikash) but they also have food they make to order like lamb chops and steaks. There's always pierogies (although they charge extra if you pick pierogies as one of your sides) and other sides. If you are here for dinner you also get the salad bar. There's a piano player during dinner. There are always long lines here. They are only open for lunch Mon-Fri and only for dinner Fri and Sat."}
{"text":"We had read about this restaurant before we came to Cleveland and knew we had to make time to eat here.  It is not easy to find, but well worth the trip.  I'm just sorry I couldn't taste everything, the owners were so friendly.  I highly recommend this restaurant and hope anyone travelling through this city will stop by."}
{"text":"A Cleveland institution.

I've been eating here for over 20 years.  Probably had most everything on the menu.  Not every single thing.  But all the highlights.

Had dinner here tonight with family.  It's important to note they are only open for lunch during the week.  And on Friday and Saturday night.  It doesn't matter when you go plan on waiting in line.  But it moves fast.  When it's your turn you grab a cafeteria tray with silverware.  And you move down the line grabbing dessert first, then a drink, then you tell the nice lady behind the counter what you want for dinner (or lunch).  All dinners are served with 2 sides.  And you get the salad bar at dinner (not at lunch).  You pay at the end of the line.

People line up and wait because the food is exactly the same every time you go.  It's very consistent.  And this time of year (winter) it's comfort food at its finest.  Once we finished paying at the end of the line someone helped us find a seat and carry my kids trays as they got heavy as we went down the line.  We got a table this evening in the dining room with the fire place.  Someone stoked the fire and put more logs on the fire while we ate dinner.  It all adds to the ambience.  My mom sat where a former President sat.  A plaque said so on the wall.

Speaking of ambiance.  This place looks and feels like a place you would have eaten at 50 years ago.  Along with 50 years of memorabilia hanging on all the walls.  You can inspect the wares as you wait in line and check out a menu along the way.  As you turn the line you can see the skyline of downtown in the background outside.  This place is about as Cleveland as it gets.

Portions here are huge.  Tonight I ordered stuffed cabbage with saurkraut and green beans.  I also grabbed a small side salad from the salad bar and cucumber salad.  I got one stuffed cabbage roll.  And it filled half the plate by itself.  Tender, perfectly cooked meat.  Tender and perfectly cooked cabbage.  With a homemade sauce on top.  Sauerkraut here is very tart.  If you don't like the very tart kind I'd skip it.  Other sides like corn or green beans are just ok.  I'm watching my carb intake.  Otherwise, I'd have gotten the homemade mashed potatoes or pierogies.  Both are perfect.  Side salad was standard.  Cucumber salad was the creamy kind and is delicious.

This restaurant is not just about the food or the location.  It really is an institution.  A destination.  Check it out."}
{"text":"What to do on a frigid, snowy, blustery weekend in Cleveland? Thankfully, my boyfriend, a Cleveland native, had the answer: Eat. A lot. 

Sokolowski's was high on my list of places to visit after seeing the buttery bounty on \"No Reservations.\" On the day of our visit, I also watched Michael Symon's mouth-watering tribute to Sokolowski's pierogies on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" Symon lauded the Sokolowski pierogie for being an \"unapologetic\" combination of starch and starch drenched in butter, and that made it a no-brainer. 

Sokolowski's ordering process rushes you through a line that begins with desserts, but my hosts encouraged me to skip the assortment of sweets and save room for the main event. Thankfully, I listened. I chose chicken paprikash for my entree instead of a dozen pierogies, since a duo of pieorgies were available as a side. For my other side, I got tasty stewed green beans.

My chicken was fine but I was struck with entree envy when I tasted a dining companion's wiener schnitzel. The deliciousness of that thin, crisp, fried piece of veal far surpassed the taste of my chicken. Of course, that didn't stop me from eating most of my chicken, both of my pierogies, and a good helping of my man's stuffed cabbage.  Next time I will talk him into splitting two entrees: a dozen pirogies and the wiener schnitzel. And if you're in Cleveland, I recommend you do the same. (Just not with my man. Find someone else to share with.)

A salad bar comes with every meal, and I filled up quite a plate of veggies before we sat down to the table. The salad is a nice counterbalance to an otherwise incredibly heavy meal, but I shouldn't have let my eyes for greens be bigger than the area of my stomach I was willing to dedicate to them. That's an easy mistake to make with the embarrassment of riches that ends up on every Sokolowski's tray. 

Service is cafeteria style, but very polite and helpful with suggestions. Once you reach the register, you can order a drink to be delivered from the bar, but that just adds a step to the process. Next time I will stop by the bar on my way into the restaurant and carry my beer through the food line, taking sips of liquid courage for the feast ahead of me."}
{"text":"Caveat fudium.   (Let the foodie beware.) 

If you've never been here, don't let this review stop you from trying the Inn's fare.

Sure.  ALL restaurants---even exclusive, uptown, celebrity-chef-owned---have off-days, and the occasional off-entree, too.  If their patrons have deep enough pockets, that won't stop them from continuing to dine there.  And even more affordably-priced restaurants have their loyal, forgiving customers.  I happen to be one of them.  And haven't most of us had one or two home-prepared culinary disasters ourselves?  Were we forced to throw in the kitchen towel and toss out the stove because family members adamantly refused to continue eating in?  

On arriving, 30 or so feet from the entry was an outdoor spit billowing smoke and filling the air with a wonderfully intoxicating aroma. The attendant, busy basting a whole pig, touted it as a favorite choice that was slow roasted for a minimum of 10 hours.  I'd made dozens of pork butts that never took more than 3 or 4 oven-hours, and each resulted in flavorful, succulent tenderness every time. This was, after all, the whole pig, so everything being equal, I supposed it WOULD require an especially longer cooking time.  This popular spit-roasted pork would be my entree choice for sure.    

Inside, walking along the cafeteria-style stretch of varied side dishes I spotted their renowned potato pancakes.  These---of course---would make the perfect accompaniment.  I'd eaten lightly that day in anticipation for this visit and was ready to chow down.  Based on written reviews, word-of-mouth, WVIZ cookbook segments that featured this restaurant, and the Inn's own self-promoting print advertising, I was CERTAIN that I'd have a deliciously memorable experience.  

It couldn't have been worse.  Either my two choices were strokes of extraordinarily bad luck OR all the adoring fans haven't a clue as to what good food should taste like OR I have the most exacting, elevated, finely-tuned palate since Escoffier.  

The pork's texture was as close as pork can get to that of sopping wet, stringy floor mop.  It had no true form or shape---just a soft mush-like mound.  (That didn't stop the server from plopping the limp mass onto my plate, however, which of course I wasn't aware of until I took the first bite.)  As far as any discernable flavor there was none to speak of.   It was as if after roasting, it was placed into a pot of plain tap water and left to soak for days.  And the potato pancakes?  I'm a better than average scratch cook and am very familiar with thoughtful food preparation and how these foods should taste.  Not even CLOSE to being freshly made.  In flavor?  What I'd expect an ancient tree root to taste like. They were d-a-a-a-y-s old---maybe even a week or more.  If previously frozen, they were unmarked and had remained long forgotten in some freezer (by-passing customary date rotation), were just recently discovered, and I was served from that thawed and reheated batch that may have gone as far back as the Reagan era.  

Except for a few nibbles from the ordinary-yet-at-least-edible salad, this meal (actually just 2 bites of each to confirm my disbelief) was one of the two worst meals I've ever had---and I've had thousands in my lifetime.  Most were VERY good, plus many excellent.  Had the roast pork and potato pancakes been new additions to their menu I might never have considered writing this, but they weren't.  This was a case of culinary criminality, and I'd been a taste bud/eye witness to felony food abuse.

Instead of taking that plate straight back to the cafeteria line, rather than disrupting the enjoyable, upbeat conversations we were all having at the table, I kept my unexpected disappointment to myself---especially since two continued eating their pork and I didn't want them feeling uncomfortable.  My once-ravenous appetite had abruptly shut down and the thought of explaining these issues to an employee might make me feel worse.  For the first time ever, I was experiencing F.F.T.H., (pronounced f-f-t-h), which stands for Fell For The Hype.  I had no desire to eat ANYTHING else they prepared.  If these two customer favorites were this unappetizing why on earth would I ever consider something the customers liked less.  At the very least, I should have requested a refund, but I didn't.  And, in all fairness, I'm sure I would have received it.  

I'm just a nice, honest person who looked forward to an outstanding meal, but instead, was served something inedible.  They're probably really good people here at the Inn, and maybe all their key players were off that day.  But when you're going through the line, do yourself a favor.  Before they put the stuff on the plate, point to it first, look them straight in the eye, and ask them if Gramma's recipe and handling instructions were followed word for word.  If yes---cross your fingers---and hope for the best . . . that they're so well-known for."}
{"text":"Cleveland Landmark. Cafeteria dining at its best. Nothing fancy here but delicious food."}
{"text":"So good. Just watch out, if you go on an empty stomach you're going to grab too much food. This place had the BEST meatloaf I've ever had....hands down! Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, especially for a place that's supposed to be a Cleveland institution. Chicken paprikash was light on flavor. Pierogis seemed like they had been sitting for a long time and the butter and onions wasn't good. Potato pancakes were limp and almost soggy. And I know it's cafeteria style but all the food seemed like it had been sitting a long time and was lukewarm. The only good thing I have to say was that the portions were huge, but the food didn't make you want to fill up. Still looking for a great chicken paprikash in town."}
{"text":"I have lived with a Polish family before and this food was just like getting home cooking there.

The food was so good and great portions.  The place does get very busy very quickly so I recommend that you get there as soon as they open.  

I had the stuffed cabbage and the pierogi as a side and I did not regret my choice one bit.

This is a must place to stop if you are in the Cleveland area and you love Polish food."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner last Saturday, which was probably a mistake with 2 year old twins as the line was longer than I have experienced in past visits.   We noticed by 5:15 it had thinned down and so would suggest not getting there when it opens at 4PM. 

This is old school cafeteria style. The desserts are first thing you view, but truthfully I don't know how anyone could have room for dessert after eating the healthy portions of the comfort food entrees. The entrees are all accompanied by two sides and a salad bar. The pork chops are huge and you get two. Stuffed cabbage is the biggest I have seen. And you can never go wrong with the chicken paprikash. Sides are varied and include dumplings, sauerkraut, cabbage and noodles and fresh veggie of the day. I am not a fan of the sauerkraut (it has a weird creaminess to it) but any other side I have had is spot on. 

This place is Cleveland so everyone who lives here needs to experience it and any out-of-towners  that want to see what Cleveland is all about should stop here during their stay."}
{"text":"The best Polish restaurant in the area. The portions are large and delicious, it's cafeteria style, it has great historical pieces, and it's cozy."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better cafeteria style restaurants that I've been to. Lake perch was good but not the best I've had. The perogies were really good. Great service, love the restaurant itself. We look forward to going back next time we're in Cleveland. Maybe try a steak- they looked really good- or maybe one of the huge cabbage rolls that everyone loves so much."}
{"text":"You definitely don't want to miss an opportunity to eat at this, Cleveland's oldest family-owned restaurant. Go hungry, because the portions are huge. They have specials every day, but I went with the 5 pierogie plate with two sides. The desserts are homemade, too. This place has lots of character (and characters). Enjoy a beer and listen to the locals."}
{"text":"Authentic Polish food in downtown Cleveland. Oh so good! I love the cafeteria style restaurants that serve good, home-cooked food. Everything here is good, so I recommend coming with a large group of people and having each person order something different so that everyone at the table can sample Sokolowski's delectable eats."}
{"text":"If your family is Polish, this place will make you feel nostalgic, but you'll notice immediately that it's not particularly good. I know that sounds mean to be reproach a Cleveland standby, but it's true. The food here just really isn't that good. I came here once a long time ago and didn't think much of it then decided to give it another try. The food is bland as well as very heavy and greasy. Now Eastern European food is generally known to be heavy, but certainly it's acceptable if it is equally rich and flavorful which this isn't. Again, if your family is Polish you have at least one family member that can make food far better than this. 

The weird thing is that I continue to recommend this place to people... because it does represent a lot of what Cleveland is. The inside is reminiscent of your family's basement with wood paneling, decades old furniture and family photos everywhere. These are good things... this is what makes this restaurant so comforting and nostalgic to people. Therefore I do continue to tell visitors to come here, but I always add the disclaimer that the food is simple and nothing more. I don't recommend coming here for the quality of food, but rather for the experience of coming to a nearly 100 year old restaurant in Cleveland."}
