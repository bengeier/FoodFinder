{"text":"I had lunch at this charming, rustic little bookstore café and discovered what all the regulars already knew: the food here is good. You can relax at a table and browse through a few books as you enjoy soup & sandwiches, baked goods or coffee or tea. I had a turkey sandwich made the way I like it and a pretty darn good latté. The service was a little slow (they were busy), but well worth the wait. This is a great place to meet a friend for coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent Coffee, great quiet and small shop atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic place -  Great coffee, nice freshly made sandwiches and muffins. lovely staff, set in a unique & cosy atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning. The sun is shining. Nothing on the agenda this morning other than a nice sleep in. Annnnd then, my dogs start barking. And barking. And barking. And even some time in the back yard won't quiet them. Fine, we're off for a walk!! Luckily for my dogs (and my husband!), my morning grouch was calmed when we came across Bell's Bookstore Cafe, a delightful little coffee shop / bookstore only blocks away from our house. 

We were greeted by rows of books, a few little trinkets for sale and the smell of fresh baking. This place has it all. Friendly staff, great coffee and a surprisingly large selection of homemade treats (including gluten-free options!).  Who can be unhappy any longer?! They also have a water dish and place to tie up your puppies just outside the door.  These guys are even true to their posted operating hours - we arrived just after 8 and they were already open. Not always true with small businesses and early mornings. 

The surroundings are not super posh, but it is comfortable and you can tell it is loved by its owners and customers alike. I get the feeling that Bell's is fiercely supported by the local community, and I think that is great. Sure, the Starbucks and Phil & Sebastian's down the road have figured out how to perfect the same americano time after time. But this place feels like home, they make a damn good coffee and delicious home made treats. But most importantly: I love supporting local business. So next time my dogs wake me up at 7am on a Sunday morning, I'll treat them with a little walk over to Bell's Bookstore Cafe.

{"text":"Thank you BELL! 
You found a book no other book store I searched could find. 
You are now my permanent book store!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighbourhood coffee place ... with lots of wood, sugary standard fair, and weak coffee.
If I'm paying $3 for a coffee - it's gotta be current & cool.  
Otherwise I prefer coffee at home or at your house."}
{"text":"So disappointed. l called the day before I went to ensure that they would trade books with me.  When I got there, the 2 women were very impersonal and informed me that they don't trade anymore and will be getting rid of the books.  I said I just spoke with a lady the day before about trading.  They asked who I spoke with.  Whoever was working the afternoon shift the day before.  That's who.  Stupid women.  No customer service at all.  Very indifferent and no apology for the change in less than 24 hours.  I will not go back there and they should change the name as it is misleading."}
{"text":"Bell's Bookstore and Cafe is a delight! I've been a regular here for years, what with a monthly book club meeting to keep me coming back. But it's also a lovely spot to stop on a warm afternoon to hang out on the patio and sip a cup Red Cappucino--that's a cap made with red rooibos tea rather than espresso. Delish! They've recently reorganized a bit, getting rid of at least 50% of their books, but the staff are warm and friendly, the sausage rolls are warm and flaky, and this quaint little corner on the outskirts of Marda Loop is one of my absolute favorite coffee shop destinations."}
{"text":"Best Rubarb Muffins EVER!  Great little spot thats known by the locals. Good people and good homemade treats."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful fall day and so I decided to check out more of my neighborhood coffee places. I had to drive by twice to get parking, however, once my car was nestled along the roadway, I coasted on in to this little coffee shop.  The ladies were super friendly and lots of laughing and joking around. They have about 12 small tables that are perfect for intimate conversations and chillin'.  As I was by myself, I would of loved to see a cozy couch or arm chair to snuggle into to read my book. Oh! Books!  They have walls of books to read if you forget yours. The lighting is bright without being harsh. I can totally see coming here as a regular just to sit back and drink delicious brews.  Good job!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent a bookstore/cafe a lot, but it's been closed for a couple years now so you can imagine my delight when I happened by Bell's Cafe & Bookstore.  There's something about the combination of a bookstore and cafe that is extremely inviting and intriguing.  I guess it's just nice to know that you can sit down and enjoy your coffee without staring at the wall.

There are a few tables to enjoy your time at, some nestled right in the back beside all the books.  There's also shelves and shelves of different books to choose from, so you can probably find something worth a read.  Books aside, they also have some gifts for sale.  You can buy mugs and cups, and teapots and steepes.  If the books aren't enough to satisfy your boredom, they also have wireless internet and a newly opened art studio in the basement.

They have a large selection of baked goods like carrot cake, muffins, cookies, cheesecake, etc., all for a pretty decent price.  The coffees come in four different sizes and are serve-yourself.  They're pretty trusting in there since someone could buy a small, but take and fill a large cup.  I guess they trust their patrons.

The ladies working there were extremely cute and super nice.  They didn't seem annoyed that I was a newb and didn't quite know what I was doing.  In fact, they laughed with me when I finally realized I could serve my own coffee.

A cafe and bookstore is just such a good idea in my mind, and this place definitely hits the spot.  It's so quaint and adorable I think anyone would love it!"}
