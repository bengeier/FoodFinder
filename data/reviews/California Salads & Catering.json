{"text":"New \"enterprise\"for catering queen \"Aunt Elaine\", California Salads moved to 3201 Enterprise Parkway in Beachwood, lower level of Lakepoint Building. Great place for eat-in or carry-out - breakfast or lunch. Open 8a.m.-2p.m. M-F. Freshly cooked or prepared foods, friendly service. Catering for residential and business parties and meetings. We called ahead for \"famous\" California salads. Ate outside on attractive patio adjacent to facility- beautiful day. Very cool!!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Beachwood location several times in the past and was hugely disappointed in just about everything the Rockside Rd location had to offer. The service was horrible!! Ordered one salad and one sandwich and it took 35 minutes!! We were the only people in the place! Will never go back to this place again. It was one older lady making a girl on her first day make all the orders!"}
{"text":"This location went out of business. They can do some delivery from the independence location. Here's the website  http://californiasalads.com/inout2.html"}
{"text":"Very creative and fresh. The owner is very hands on and involved. She evidently had a catering business before this and it shows- when we've worked with her, she has been exceedingly nice and accommodating and the food is just great. Plus she comes up with new ideas all the time. Nice to support a local business."}
{"text":"Hard to find- can't see it from Chagrin- you actually have to enter from Green.  Once you enter, you won't be impressed.  It is very outdated- like an old Embassey Suites with the pink & green interior colors.  I had the Newport Beach salad and it was OK. Mushrooms were past their time. Salmon was good & dressing was good, too.  My friend had the Waldorf salad, which looked better than mine.  It was loaded up with fruit and served with fat free raspberry vinigairette.  Funny, though, she thought mine looked better.  Either way, their portions are huge!  Split a salad!  The pretzel bagel they serve with the salad is yummy!"}
{"text":"Food is Fantastic. When you can get it... Very misleading with the delivery option.  Their menu states the following: California Salads Hours  of  Operation   Open  from  8:00  a.m.  to  2:30  p.m.  Monday  thru  Friday   Catering  &  Delivery  Anytime    Notice that it says anytime for delivery? Yet when you call they tell you they rarely every deliver for just 1 item. The woman that takes your order has some of the coldest phone etiquette ever."}
