{"text":"My favourite sandwich! The staff are so kind and make everyone feel like a regular. I love taking my friends here. Great place to go when you're hungry! Good prices, too."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when this place opened but I am less thrilled now that I have tried the place.  First issue: We grabbed a table and \"set it\" with a napkin and their crappy plastic utensils (even for dine in!). The AC was blowing so hard that the napkins kept blowing off the table. We had to either hold them or have them pinned under the salt shaker.   Second Issue: We ordered matzo ball soup. The 1/2 full cardboard container (again for dine in!) arrived at the table only slightly warmer than gazpacho. The matzo ball was room temperature and the carrots were crunchier than al dente.  The re-heated soup was returned to us without even a \"sorry about that\".   Third Issue: We ordered a turkey club to split. There were no choices of bread, there was no pickle wedge with it (what kind of deli is this?) and it was served in this miniscule basket that was lined with a piece of paper that popped out every time the sandwich was removed. The sandwich itself was not bad.   This is such a pity. We live just a few minutes away and we would probably be regulars if the place had been halfway decent. I think $27 for 2 small soups and 1 sandwich is quite pricey even when everything is done well, but we probably would have still paid the price.  I think we will have to continue to walk across the street to Sunterra for less expensive and better fare."}
{"text":"I will not return to a place I'm unwelcome to frequent.   From almost the moment our Meetup group sat down (after ordering a first round of drinks and pastries, mind you) we were given the cold shoulder. Then the lady came over and requested we move to make space for the lunch crowd.  This was at 10:45. Lunch????? But okay - we are nothing if not obliging of a business's wishes, however I was left baffled by the third person reference - who was \"I\" if not PART OF this esteemed \"lunch crowd,\" and I was already actually there. First come first serve, right?!  Strike one.   I proceeded to order my drink and pastry.   Attituuuude.   Strike two.   We decide to distribute ourselves throughout the space with some of us sitting and some standing - others waiting for a chair or another table....only 20 of us in the space, which was a comfortable fit. An hour and a half into our coffee Meetup chatter and we are briskly interrupted by the (manager I presume) with a sad attempt at an apologetic request to vacate so there would be space for some kind of lunch crowd - which still had yet to make itself known. Those that had graced the space we're already seated enjoying their food. Perhaps they didn't know they too would experience a quick and hasty shooing to make space for a mysterious dinner crowd.   Strike three.   I had already made my mind up on the first strike that I wouldn't get a refill or anything further this morning, and by the third strike she had successfully put my desire to remain silent and forget about the whole affair to rest. Not only do I refuse to return but to now I'm compelled to alert unwary travellers to the unprofessional and unwelcoming spirit that dwells within that space.  It's really rather too bad, because I rather liked that cheesecake. C'mon though - even McDonald's provides a more hospitable service than this.   Dine alone and at your own risk. They might not see you as a viable customer but as something taking up valuable space for that lunch crowd whose surely still on their way."}
{"text":"Finally got to Grumans on Elbow Drive.  A real disappointment. I've been to Jewish deli's in New York and Palm Springs and there is no comparison.  Gruman's is sad, over toasted bread, no sauce on the Rueben and a tiny scoop of potato salad. Also plastic cutlery REALLY, how not classy. Real deli prices and not quality deli food"}
{"text":"Stopped in several times for a Montreal Smoked Beef sandwich and chips, ended up with more that that. Great deli, great sandwich, overall just great!"}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting the menu that is presented at the downtown location.  I don't mind the design of the place as it is bright and it takes advantage of natural light.  The fact that paper plates and paper cutlery as well as a lack of glasses for stay in fare is a bit disappointing.   The service was ok.  Not sure I'll be breaking my fast at this location anytime in the future.   Maybe I'll lunch it there so I can enjoy a Reuben Sammy.  I'll report back when I do so."}
{"text":"I am so pleased that Gruman's has opened a new location close to home! The Reuben and Latkes are delicious and well worth the price. You can taste the value of the ingredients in the sandwich, compared to other deli's in the city. HIGHLY recommend.   I think a couple of the reviews on here are from customers who don't necessarily understand the concept of the new Gruman's location. This location is meant to be a delicatessen, not a restaurant. So if you're expecting table service- the downtown location is more your pace. However, the employees at Britannia are super accommodating for dine in and are always cleaning up tables for the next customers.   If you're expecting fabulous food for take out, or to have a casual \"no frills\" lunch- the Britannia location is a great location with quality prepared meals and sandwiches, soups, etc.   I have been greeted warmly and professionally by the employees and owner of the establishment, every time I have been in - I have never had issue with any \"attitude\" that has been described in past reviews (rants)."}
