{"text":"I'd been searching for a waxer for about a month and no esthetician felt right to me until I came across Star, who a friend highly recommended to me. I am soooo glad I waited and didn't settle for less than amazingness with my brazilian! Star is so kind and funny and professional and truly passionate about what she does. She's the perfect mix between comforting and efficient. She was so thorough with her work and I didn't feel like I was being pushed out the door like I felt at my previous place. In fact, she spent some time at the end tidying everything up. She's really knowledgable about the products that she uses and at the end gave me some really helpful after-wax maintenance tips, as well as a loofah scrubber/exfoliator as a gift :) My lady bits and I are in total gratitude! Thanks again Star."}
{"text":"Star is amazing and very professional! Went to her studio for my first ever waxing and it wasn't nearly as scary or painful as I expected! She explains everything she's doing and is very gentle and thorough!! :)  She even has two locations (Goleta and Downtown SB) so it's convenient and fairly priced for everyone!

Also...she had already closed for the day when I called, but she stayed later than her normal hours to accommodate me!!!! She obviously values her customers' needs!!
A+++
5 Stars for Star!!!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for ages -- Star is hands down the best waxing/sugaring practitioner I've ever met.  She is the most friendly, GENTLE, and skilled woman on the planet.  Getting a brazilian sugar or wax with her is less than half as painful as anywhere else I've tried (and it's cheaper, too!)  I can't recommend her enough, she is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Star was GREAT!! She did my eyebrows exactly how I wanted them done anddd she even filled them in for me afterward so I didn't have to go outside lookin all ratchet :p  She was so friendly and understanding of my suggestions! The studio was so cute and comfortable! The lights were PERFECT for seeing every little hair/detail.  Also, she uses hard wax...which is way better than strips! Doesn't leave any mess or wax on your face and is almost painless! I am graduating in 3 days but I would deff recommend her to any of my friends and anyone who looks on yelp! :)"}
{"text":"Star was by far the best waxer I have been to.  Tried the sugaring method for the first time- loved it! She is experienced and fast- two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been getting waxed for a few years now and have tried a lot of places as I am always moving. Star offers, hands down, the best waxing experience I have ever had. She is professional, consistent, and I feel that she really cares about her work. She is fantastic. I will be moving again soon and will start my search for another Star!"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting a wax and I bought it through living social. I had thought about it and always chickened out because I thought it would be painful. Star was really professional, and made the process easy. It was not as painful, embarrassing, and awkward like I thought it might be. She made the process almost painless and suggested taking some Tylenol if I wanted too, though it was so painless I didn't need it. But everyone handles pain differently. Honestly Star made the process easy for a first timer. Definitely suggest going to her!"}
{"text":"Just used my Living Social deal here today and had an amazing experience. It was comfortable, friendly, and very thorough. This was the best wax job I have ever had: relatively painless (considering you're ripping hair out) quick, and clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Star is so great. I found her on yelp and am so happy I did! She is professional, clean, and kind. I showed her a picture of what I wanted my eyebrows to look like and she's the first person who's actually been able to make it happen for me (everyone else I've been with gave me a thousand reasons why I couldn't do my brows that way, without offering other styles or shapes, etc.) She even taught me about eyebrow makeup and how to fill them in correctly, which in my opinion, is invaluable. I'm currently using some topical face creams that contain retinol, so my skin tore a little during the waxing (I already knew it would happen and warned Star, who was still very cautious). She sent me home with a lot of coconut oil to help with the healing process, which I thought was extremely thoughtful. She texted me a few days after my session to check in on my tear and to ask how my brows were working out. Normally I would have found a check-up text to be annoying, but she was sincere and professional. 

I love Star and will always come back. She's an awesome teacher (of techniques, styles, etc.), an overall kind person, and does beautiful work. Thank you, Star!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Star (aka Phoenix Wax Studio)! I went to her for my first bikini wax and loved how gentle, thorough, and nice she was. I didn't feel uncomfortable, she walked me through each and every step, and she checked in with me periodically as she waxed, to make sure everything was just as I wanted. She still does each time I see her.
I saw Star for a few months, but when I had to leave town for two months I was forced to try waxing elsewhere. After having experienced waxing by other \"professionals\", it put in perspective just how valuable she really is! I have continued to see her on a regular basis for both a bikini and underarm wax. It's true! It gets easier each time you go!

Last note: the wax she uses is phenomenal! Quality hard wax and her own sugaring formula. I LOVE them both and as another critic stated, \"she makes the process, ALMOST, painless,\" considering hair is being ripped out (but quickly and cleanly).

As for the studio itself, it is very clean/hygienic, professional, and comfortable. I love the decor! Walking through the tanning salon and into her studio only adds to the beauty of it all. European Sun is just as clean and its staff are just as friendly. European Sun is a great reflection of Star as well.

I do not know what I'm going to do when I have to move out of the area! I would take her with me if I could!"}
{"text":"Star is amazing! I was looking for a place that was located close to where I live & I called about 4 places before I got in contact with star & at first there was a small miscommunication between yelps address & where she is currently located but I was able to book an appointment for the same day only a couple hours after we spoke (first star). She is such a sweet woman & was very friendly & professional over the phone as well as upon arriving (2nd star). If you've ever gotten a Brazilian wax then you know that time is of the essence in a sense as in if you don't have a person who waxed quickly & efficiently it will be the most painful experience.. with that being said star did cover large areas at a time which made the session not as painful as I've had in the past (3rd star). She talked me through the process of the type of wax she was using & every step she was going through which made me more comfortable with the large areas she did at a time.(4 star). The 5th star is mostly for the great customer service she has & that she did sugaring at the end & also gave some oil which both added to the fact that I wasn't all sticky from the wax & I didn't have to rush home to take another shower to get all of the wax off. Having someone who gives you a treatment they would want for themselves is top of the list for great business owners! I have definitely found the only person I will be going  to for Brazilian wax & it's even better that I would rather put my hard earned money towards a wonderful small business owner such as star!! I highly recommend her services & she is very well priced but you'll definitely want to give her more considering how bomb she is!!"}
{"text":"I just realized I've never wrote a review about Star!!! I absolutely LOVE her! I remember feeling very nervous as I'm walking into my first Brazilian appointment with her.. To start off, she scheduled an additional 15 minutes with me to talk me through things. This calmed my nerves sooooo much. I've been with her for over a year now. She's loving, careful, and very friendly! She always has such a warm sincere smile on. I love her and would recommend her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to get my first Brazilian with Star today. I was super nervous coming into it but Star makes you feel extremely comfortable about the process. It was quicker and far more painless than I thought! She's extremely personable so that made everything a lot less awkward. She knows what she's doing and recommended a few things regarding ingrown hairs. Also extremely sweet and told me I could text her if I had any questions or any issues! 
She's more expensive than some places around here but I definitely think she's worth it. I will be returning back regularly!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Santa Barbara for four years and can't believe I just found out about Star. She's absolutely amazing.

I called her on a Tuesday, she answered my call and fit me in for a Thursday at a time that was most convenient for me. When she brought me in her room was well decorated and very clean. The chair she had me lay on was the comfiest I've ever laid on while getting a wax!

She's also great at what she does. She is patient and tells you exactly what she is doing and when she is doing it. Also, she's great at talking to you and not making it awkward, which I appreciate. I felt very comfortable with her, moreso than others. She uses hard wax, which is so much better for your skin! When she was done she took some sugar and took off remaining wax bits, and she said we could try sugaring next time.

I highly recommend Star to everyone in the are! She is professional, clean and knows what she's doing."}
{"text":"First time getting a Brazilian wax from Star & let me just say she was by far a super star!! She made me feel comfortable, walked me through everything & I left feeling happy with my outcome! Happy I found her! Definitely going back! :)"}
{"text":"Star is FANTASTIC. I started going to her because of the livingsocial deal she posted and I couldn't be more happy I did. I've had very bad waxing experiences in the past with people who were extremely unhygienic. Star is quite the opposite--very clean, meticulous, and sooo friendly! She uses the sugaring technique and hard wax when necessary which are worlds better than normal wax. I've gone to her 3 times in a row and my hair growth has significantly diminished. This is my first Yelp review ever... that's how good she is! I highly recommend her!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great for guys. Been coming to star to keep my fuzzy back beach friendly for summer and it's so much better than wax."}
{"text":"First time here. Star is awesome!

She made my waxing appointment the highlight of my week and an overall positive experience.

This is by far one of the most pleasant Brazilian wax experiences I've had and now my go to in SB.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Star welcomed me very nicely and i felt this bond with her as if i knew her my whole life. she used hard wax and i didnt even feel a thing, i am a regular client of hers. not to mention her room is so unique and calm. good vibes from that room and from her. i love you star"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews on Star, I called her to set up my first wax. I was pretty nervous but she made everything SO easy and accessible. I am really glad to have found her! I was pleasantly surprised at how little the wax (a Brazilian) hurt and she made me feel very comfortable the whole time. Already booked my follow-up appointment!"}
