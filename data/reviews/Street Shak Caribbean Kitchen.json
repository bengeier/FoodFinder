{"text":"Amazing and unforgettable beef patty.  The jerk chicken, coconut rice & beans and spinach & kale was equally so.    My gf and I shared the above meal And we were pleasantly full by the end (we were hungry!)  The food was worth the unexpected long wait time (like 20 minutes - unsure if this is The norm)!  We ate in the restaurant.  Staff was very friendly and courteous and they offer unlimited tap water - just ask.  They had an array of Caribbean style Hot sauces to choose from and wise patois sayings translated to English splashed on the wall which was very cooool.  Excellent food!  Great service!  Poor wait time (hopefully this is not the norm.  If it is, just inform the customer prior, to avoid surprises :)"}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken plate with the homemade hot sauce.  Easily some the best chicken I've ever had.  And as a hot sauce enthusiast, their hot sauce was legit good.  One of those places where if I lived close by I'd visit often.  Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. My wife is Trini, so we eat West Indian food quite a bit. We ordered fish cakes and bake, jerk chicken with curry potatoes,  macaroni pie, chow mein, and wings. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. The only thing that would make this place even better is if the had some proper crispy doubles!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, bland overcooked food. My chicken was tough, and rice and beans flavourless."}
{"text":"Street Shak is wonderful.  Staff are friendly - loved the decor with the West Indian sayings!  Food is excellent ..we tried patties, bakes and codfish cakes, jerk wings, Roti..Red Stripe and wine .  Tony ...you kept us entertained and very, very well fed!  You have a great place and I will definitely be back.  Highly recommend Street Shak!!"}
{"text":"AMAZEBALLS!!! Not for the faint of heart. Only downside is it's so good you don't want to stop, AND the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Really good west Indian roti. Only wished they used dal puri bread as their current wrap is somewhat bland. Filling is on point though"}
{"text":"So, I came across this place while it was going through renovations last month. I am really happy that they reopened. The food can be considered \" a little pricey\" in terms of portions, but it  is good, fresh and filling. I also like the ambiance and the fact that it is a welcoming environment.... oh yes, and the bathroom was clean!!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Street Shak randomly one day after a long shopping day on Queen St. The only con about this place is that you will end up craving it for the next 2 weeks. Their Jerk Chicken Sandwich is SO good. my mouth water just thinking about it.. not too spicy, super juicy, and the side of fries were delicious and crispy! My friend order the jerk chicken plate and received a large enough amount to eat the next day for lunch. Also, the guy who served us (forgot his name but he is originally from Barbados!!) was super friendly and welcoming! he made us feel right at home! 10/10 would eat here again - you should try it !"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken sandwich I've had so far in the city.  Great service both for dine in and take out.  Not to be missed during your next craving for some Caribbean flavors."}
{"text":"i ordered from street shak via uber eats and got the seared fish sandwich. best decision i've made all week! the sandwich was excellent- the fish seasoned and grilled to perfection, and flavorful. very excited to try their other items!"}
{"text":"YUM! Best beef patty I ever had! I got the oxtail with rice & beans and chickpeas. It is so filling and so worth it. Me friends and I came here after being in the Caribana parade. We were exhausted and that food hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Hello, please franchise to Denver. Quick-serve delicious Caribbean would kill it here.  Stopped into the Shak for lunch while visiting some friends in Toronto. I couldn't resist getting jerk chicken, and I'm sure glad I did. Perhaps spicy food wasn't the best play while already sweating from the heat outside, but it sure was delicious. Cooked perfectly, still moist and tender, the jerk spice was perfect. They give you extra so you can drown your fries/sides in the same jerk magic. I also got a house-made hot sauce (some variation of carrots, citrus, and habaneros) to dip my fries / chicken in.   Stopped in at the tail end of the lunch rush, and the staff was friendly and took great care of us. I'm tremendously sad that quick, affordable Jamaican is so far away."}
{"text":"Great food at a great cost! Split the vegetable roti and the fish cakes and bake with a friend and the meal was amazing and very filling! Highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service ...but i wasnt pleased about the food at t'all. First - who puts potato in oxtail? Second the noodles were REALLY hot (tobasco hot and not necessarily spicy).... and oily. I personally would NOT be going back....."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the quality of this place. The ingredients used are top notch and the recipes are not overloaded with salt (like most places). I have been 3 times, and I will only go here for Caribbean food - its simply the best! The owner, Tony is really down to earth and knows what customer service is. Thank you for bringing a quality Caribbean establishment to downtown Toronto - we needed it! Btw, the fried chicken is amazing and the portions are very solid!! ::)"}
{"text":"The lunch special, $8 jerk chicken chow mein, may be the most flavor/dollar I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Super good. The staff is friendly and the food tastes super homemade. I loved the jerk chicken and the plantains are amazing."}
{"text":"Staying late at work one night I decided to order this for the office as there were a few of us staying that night. I've heard of this place and ordered off UberEats to have it delivered to the office. We ordered 2 jerk chicken salads and 1 oxtail plate, I must say the food was underwhelming. The sauce was drenched all over the oxtail and rice and felt almost like a soup. The salads came with a vinegar-type dressing that didn't mix well with the jerk flavoring. To say I enjoyed it would be lying, I had to throw it in the garbage towards the end as it was just soggy and just sauce as I ate. I feel like I got a bad meal and they're better than this, so I'll leave it at 2 stars for future purposes of improvement."}
{"text":"Cool and hip queen west store design. Chicken is perfectly marinated and tastes great!! However, no oxtail sauce, small portions on paper plates with a scoop of plain brown rice and few veggie sides... $15 for a 2 piece jerk meal is on the upside. Needs some work on plate presentation and I will be back for sure! Maybe some colselaw on side??"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  My gf and I stumbled upon this place over the weekend.  The atmosphere of this place is great. Love the space and the decor.   We wanted to order the Oxtail but we were told they ran out of it. So I ordered the Chicken Curry Roti and the Bajan Mac n' Cheese and my gf ordered the Jerk Chicken, Rice and Veggies.   The portions were surprisingly tiny for what we paid for. The food wasn't good and wasn't bad either, it was just okay. Wishing the dishes had a little bit more flavour, spice, and portions definitely bigger!"}
{"text":"** OK **  So I'm a big fan of fusion food, especially when it's Caribbean & Asian inspired. I immediately went in when I saw that one of their special's of the day was Jerk Chicken Chow Mein for $8 outside on their sandwich board. Two of my favourite foods. How can you go wrong? Unfortunately it went very wrong. I was trying so hard to enjoy it but the noodles were over cooked and drenched in so much of either oyster/hoisin & soya sauce - it was EXTREMELY salty. I needed to wash my mouth from the amount of sodium that was in the food so I went back and got a coconut water which was almost $5! But that's besides the point. The point is my meal sounded like it was going to be good in theory, but in practice it was unfortunately not what I expected. I want to give it another chance and maybe just get a regular jerk chicken meal but what drew me was the fusion of the foods. If I want a regular jerk chicken meal I'd go down the street to Parkdale.   Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food here is heavenly! Went on a whim and will definitely be back!!  The jerk chicken main is so tasty. Excellent portion size: a filling dish for a great price, especially for Queen West. The jerk dry rub was delicious and had some kick. A+++. Chicken was perfectly cooked, and quality meat.   Rice and peas are on point- there was even a tiny bit of fresh ginger in it, which I'm told is the secret key to good rice and peas. Get the chicken gravy for your rice for extra flavour.   The mixed veggies had a hint of garlic and were hearty and FRESH.   If you're looking for libations, they even have Red Stripe stubbies.  Considering how delicious all parts of our meal was, I can't wait to go back to try more.   Plus, really nice staff. Perfect level of attentiveness."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Queen West life. Crunchy Chinese Salad was delicious and the Mahi sandwich was just the right mix of spice and crunchy fresh veggies. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delivery review!  We ordered a couple of jerk chicken dinners as our mains. Each dinner is $13.50 + tax and is about a 1/4 chicken, as it comes with half a chicken breast and either a drumstick or a thigh. So in our case we received 2 halved chicken breasts, a thigh and a drumstick collectively between our 2 orders. Then you get to choose your \"base\" between Brown rice / Vegetable fried rice / Curried potatoes / Coconut Rice. And then you top it off with a veg choice between Sauteed mix vegetables / Curried chick peas / Steamed vegetables / Coleslaw.  The chicken was juicy but the jerk seasoning was a bit disappointing as it was pretty bland and lacking in any actual spice. The curried potatoes were pretty good, and the sauteed vegetables were decent, but the curried chickpea was the weak link in side dishes. Additionally, we ordered the Bajan Macaroni Pie which was pretty good but nothing special.  Here's the admitted problem (aside from spiceless jerk and lackluster chickpeas)... Their takeout packages are terrible, They are the paper-ish ones that don't actually close. So when our food arrived not only was everything completely cold, but some of the sauces had dripped out and saturating the paper Foodora bag. making it a gross mess. I'm not even sure where that much sauce could've came from given what we were eating, but it was a mess.  In the end, it was only $40 for our meals delivered and we were happy with the portions. But I can't help but feel that perhaps eating in, where I can assume they offer hot sauce and the food will be the right temperature, would have made this a 4 star. And perhaps, if they switch to better takeout/delivery containers they'd get that 4th star as well. Unfortunately, since there are better jerk chicken places, I'm not sure I'll ever find out."}
{"text":"My company ordered a catered lunch from Street Shak.  The owners are absolutely lovely people.  They were early, kind and helpful for the setup.  The food was perfectly portioned, and delicious.  Everyone was very happy with the amount of food they had, and came back for seconds.  I'd recommend using Street Shak for catering to anyone."}
{"text":"Just ordered & ate my Uber Eats dinner from Street Shak. I had the spicy Tamirand & coconut curry tofu, the jerk spice fries (which were still crispy upon arrival), and tried the jerk chicken. I was so pleased with my food. Arrived hot, & was delicious. The Spicy Tamirand was, indeed spicy, but I could handle it. The jerk chicken was so delicious, but even spicier, and too much for me. That being said, I was raised  on bland British food."}
{"text":"Decided to come in after realizing the drool I left on my keyboard was from reading the Shak's review on the blogto site - and wasn't disappointed.    Fish cakes and bakes were delicious - those little fritterry donutty (c'mon spell check, 2 those two are definitely words..) things throughout the dish should be packaged and sold by the pound - I won't sacrifice my arteries for just anything - this is an exception.    The fish sandwich was to die for and was just a mouthful of awesomeness with every bite.    Only downsides - a tad pricey, and the diet cola had (shudder) sucralose - I don't know how people can stomach that stuff - all sweeteners are questionable, but sucralose just tastes wrong.  I shall be back."}
{"text":"The $8 specials are great. My food was delicious. I got the BBQ chicken special . Will definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"If you like your roti gentrified, this is the place to go.  The food tasted like someone was trying to imitate roti as opposed to authentic family cooking. The interior was also over-designed and geared towards a completely different crowd than other roti shops around town. The \"real\" plates and silverware really turned me off.  When I went, they were out of a few menu items, so I had to skip my goat fix and settle for chicken. And I was very disappointed. While the roti skin was very good and fresh, the chicken had no depth of flavor, and there didn't seem to be any vegetables inside, not even potatoes. The vegetable roti was better, but still not what I was hoping for.   I guess other people like this place, but it really wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Place pretty good.  I was sceptical thinking it might be another main stream restaurant.  I was welcomed by some maxwell playing on the background which is pretty awesome.  Customer service was on point.  Really nice staff members and they take good care of you.  Even the staff at the back cooking were asking how's the food and how we're doing etc.  The food was pretty good.  I ordered oxtail and side of barbecue chicken and my girlfriend had jerk chicken.  All of the food we ordered was enjoyable.  It's a bit costly compare to my normal Jamaican food joints.  But I can't complain with the portions and the taste of the food.  Would go back again to try something different."}
{"text":"First time here. So disappointed at the jerk chicken. Extremely dry. I was excited to order from this place after seeing a four star review on yelp. People were saying how great the jerk chicken tastes here. I have had some best jerk chicken near bloor and Bathurst, so was hoping this would at least be as good. Super disappointed that the chicken is dry and the sauce of the chicken also dried out. So sad."}
{"text":"@STREETSHAK #QUEENSTREETWEST #BBQ #CARIBBEAN  I popped in here for lunch one day - sudden unplanned plans, and no regrets. As a person who can't handle spice, walking into a Caribbean place was actually scary. But they had an $8 special for barbecue chicken and rice that I confirmed several times over was not spicy. And it sure wasn't. The chicken and rice were full of taste. The only thing spicy on the plate was the cold slaw.   For a lunch spot (especially if you're not ordering a special), Street Shak can be a tad pricey. It's worth one try atleast, however. Glad I tried the place - may be back for the bbq chicken special."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Street Shak Caribbean Kitchen.  I've walked by it many many times and and have been wanting to check it out.  I love love love chicken rotis and ordered one.  I usually head to Island Foods when I'm craving a roti.  This was a different style than theirs in taste and the filling but it was delicious.  I'll be back again for a chicken roti and I'd love to try their jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Had BBQ chicken and curried peas with brown rice. Very good meal. Staff very polite and friendly. I took note how clean the place was......very clean. With I had jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with a decent size menu that isn't too overwhelming. Most items are priced around $10-15 bucks after taxes. Since I didn't want something as heavy as a roti, I decided to get a jerk chicken sandwich with coldslaw. The sandwich was made fresh and brought over to my table in about 5-10 minutes. I wasn't sure what to expect but the sandwich looked much more stacked than I expected (bonus). Fortunately it was as delicious as it looked and more spicy than I thought it would be (which is a plus for me). What won me over was how juicy he meat was. Despite being just a sandwich I was full after so the portion size was fair.  Other details: There is a good amount of seating but not ideal for large groups. The vibe is what you would expect from a Caribbean place with soca music in the background. The walls are decorated in entertaining catch phrases which I read through while eating my sandwich. Finally the staff were very friendly.   Overall if you are feeling Caribbean food, I don't think you can go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Love the place itself - clean, good decor and welcoming ambiance. Staff also amazing - food took longer than their usual I guess and the counter girl walked around apologizing to each guest and offering water while we waited. They bring the food to your table. Looks like a family business. Lots of Jamaican people and other Carribbean people eating here which is a sign! They have Bajan Mac n cheese, jerk, oxtail, roti, and BEER!!! Bonus.  Left one star out because I think portions are a bit small for the price. But it's queen w - rent must be expensive."}
{"text":"Street Shak has a cool environment and friendly service. Unfortunately, the time I arrived they had no oxtail so I ended up choosing the jerk chicken with curried chick peas and coconut rice and peas. The jerk chicken wasn't great but it wasn't bad either...it was just okay. I was told the curried chick peas weren't that spicy but they kinda were. The coconut rice and peas were the best out of my whole dish, it was the only thing I cleared off my plate. Although I felt it was mostly just rice and lacking peas, it did taste good though.   Next time I'll get the oxtail and not the jerk chicken nor the curried chick peas."}
{"text":"Cute spot, clean with a nice entertaining wall for folks unfamiliar with caribbean phrases and vibes. I question the authenticity of the food. Service was poor, wait time took long even though I was the only person there. Ordered the fish with vegetable fried rice, bajan fish cakes with bake and their mac pie. Mac pie was good, wasnt really in the pie format that I expected... More like mac puddle, but still tasty! The fish was meh - although size of the fish was worth the price, the fried rice was DRENCHED in soy sauce beyond palatable. Fish cakes and bake were okay too, the bake tasted old. I wouldn't consider this to be an authentic spot, and would likely not return."}
{"text":"The staff is really helpful. I never leave a tip but I probably should but I'm kind of broke half the time because I eat out so much. It's not my fault. It's because of good restaurants like Street Shak.  This place has some real food and by \"real\", I mean all of the dishes feel just right. I think I don't just judge the restaurants I go to by the way the food tastes but the way the food makes you feel after you've had it.  I usually order the feature specials (Jerk Chicken or BBQ Chicken or Chow Mein) which are ridiculously cheap and value for money along with a beef patty. I don't really need the patty but they're just so good.  Check it out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food, and it's so great to have Street Shak on Queen West. Their lunch specials are the best deals on Queen Street. You have a choice of a Jerk Chicken, BBQ pork, or their unique Jerk Chicken chow mein meals for only $8. The Jerk Chicken (my favorite as it is tender with the right amount of spice and char) and BBQ pork lunch comes with excellent sides of rice and coleslaw. Be sure to order it with their tasty gravy -- it's even worth to get it on the side, it's that good! I really like the staff there, they are so friendly and they bring your meal to your table and check in to see if everything was to our liking. Wash it all down with a bottle of Ting or Jamaican Ginger Beer, you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Finally found my way here and glad I did.  Though I really wanted to try the fish sandwich, I was in the mood for roti.  I ordered the boneless goat and was not disappointed.  Plenty of fillings and the right ratio of sauce to meat, potato etc.  Great complex flavours, perfect roti, and washed down with a Carib.  Service was fast and friendly and I look forward to returning and working my way through their menu."}
