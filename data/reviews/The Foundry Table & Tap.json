{"text":"Went in on a Thursday night place was nearly empty should have been our first inclination.  Way overpriced, tiny portions, weak drinks.  2 people bill was $100.00 and we were starving when we left.  Ridiculous.  The only positives were it was well decorated and spacious, the service was ok.  Friendly waitress.  Place won't be there very long."}
{"text":"Holy smokes is all i have to say! I wanted to try some new places around town so I did some searching around and decided to go with The Foundry in the northshore. I had no idea about the place so i asked my waitress, Maegan, what she recommended on the food menu and for dinner. Maegan recommended the foundry burger which was right in my wheel house. Nailed it! Very good! Not only was the food awesome but the service was even better! Making sure my experience was a great one and the recommendations were on point! Thanks again and i will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Cold beer and an awesome burger - hard to top!!! Really cool place, bar in the back is great to hang around at. Look forward to doing a company event in the back room!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this has Ritz crackers served with pickles, onions and some dip. There happy hour is okay from 4-6."}
{"text":"Ok place , I wouldn't go there again, food is horrible and beer is overpriced. We ordered a baby burger and it was burned."}
{"text":"Went here for a private event. Tim was our bartender and was amazing. We had smoked salmon, pork bellies, duck & the best pierogies, they were absolutely AMAZING! I would come back just for the pierogies."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great! I had the Spring Vegetable Pho and is was light and refreshing! The fresh herbs really accentuated the broth...I didn't even miss the meat. The Buffalo Pork Rinds were ok. The Shishito Peppers were delicious. They could have a little bit of salt and it would've been perfect. My husband and I shared the Homemade Parpadelle and it was fantastic! The texture of the noodles were chewy and flavorful. You could tell the noodles were fresh and home made! I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here after the Steelers game to avoid traffic. Even with a reservation we had to wait and then our server, Amy, was very inattentive and did not know the menu. Was expecting a more quality restaurant for needing a reservation. Food was just mediocre. Finally, upon leaving used the ladies room and it was disgusting. Toilet paper all over the floor, sanitary napkins and wrappers thrown all over the bathroom stall and every stall was out of toilet paper. Notified the manager at the front Justin Morgan and he just chuckled and stated \"it's after a Steelers game, what do you expect?\" Will never return."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful night at the Foundry after the Pitt game.  Everyone was top notch.  Early for our reservation? No problem and our table was set and waiting for us.  Our server Reina was friendly and warm and did not get a single order wrong despite our group of eleven.  She even accommodated separate checks which is no small feat.  The food was excellent.  Simple sandwiches and salads and soup with a tasty twist!  We ordered pierogies for a starter -  best ones I have had in Pittsburgh!  Slightly crispy on the outside and soft fluffy potatoes on the inside with a burst of flavor on some bites.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it came with a pickled slaw and was delicious.  Butternut Squash soup for others was a delight on a cold rainy day.  The beer selection was quite good and service was great!  Next time hope to sit outside on the lovely patio!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today which is Saturday. To our surprise they were serving the Brunch menu as they do every Saturday and Sunday unless there is a game then they serve from the Game day Menu. This was a nice surprise as the Brunch menu had some unique items from which to choose. Really awesome. I had the Toad in the hole,
What consists of a grilled cheese sandwich , they cut a hole in the center and fry an egg in there. I have never tasted anything like it. It was very tasty. It came with fries which were also very tasty as they have a unique seasoning on them. My husband ordered the cap't eggs Benedict which was also very tasty. Now if you don't want brunch items, the  menu also included some regular lunch items such as the Foundry Burger, Steak, Salads, Pierogis etc. We only had water to drink however they do have a lot of interesting beers on draft and very unique cocktails. The staff is friendly and courteous. We were seated promptly and our food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. The atmosphere is awesome. Lots of barn wood and metal  makes for a very unique decor. We will definitely go back and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"The good? The service was great, the back bar had a great view and the happy hour half-price drinks were appreciated. The bad? The food. We were dining with another couple who had picked the place so we could hardly make a scene, but the Flatiron steak was fatty and the pulled pork was dry, cold and overcooked (tasted like leftovers). The fries were salty and the German potato salad was from some other country. In short, if you want to drink this place is OK, but if you want good food then go somewhere else. Since we were the only table dining at the restaurant on this weeknight, it appears that many are doing so."}
{"text":"Awesome decor. Great staff. Ask for Amanda. Patio view is beautiful. Drink menu is excellent. Food is outstanding! Definitely will be BACK! Spread the word. We need good places like this in the burgh!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to have a leisurely early dinner before a concert. When we first arrived, I was concerned as the front the the restaurant was empty...just like the several other times I passed by. We led into the back area, along the river walk, to be seated. Although it, too, was empty, it quickly filled up.

The meal was very good with duck fried nuts (you have to be careful how you say that) and pulled pork mac and cheese to start. My grilled cheese and bacon was excellent and I know my dining companion enjoyed her burger.

The best was that the server did not try to rush us and even encouraged us to take our time. Our goal of having a leisurely, and tasty, dinner was accomplished."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in after a Buccos game. It is nice to have a place a bit more upscale than some of the other North Shore choices. They have a very nice beer selection as well as lots of cocktails. We order the Charcuterie plate, wings and the pho. Pho was spot on on flavor and nicely presented as a bowl with all the Vietnamese herbs and noodles rather than how it is served a a traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  The wings were very good, crunchy and right amount of heat. The Korean red sauce on them was different enough but not so different that I would still consider them Buffalo type wings. Charcuterie plate was just ok, fairly small and would have like to have a explanation as to what was on the place. It was very busy with little blobs of this and that but with no idea of what anything was. Service was very good and look forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"I've been to the Foundry several times & it's never been anything but amazing! 

From the minute i walked in the door, i loved everything about this place! The ambiance & decor are perfect! When being sat, I love that there are multiple different settings to choose from. On a nice day the best is being able to enjoy the awesome city and river views from the outdoor patio in the back! The bar area in the front was a great spot to meet up with friends & watch the game. Afterwards we went the the back to get some food. 

Every time i've gone, we always split a bunch of things with the table because we couldn't decide on just one thing. Every dish we ordered was amazing! We all especially loved the pierogis, pickle brined fried chicken sandwich & the grilled cheese sandwich!! SO GOOD! We ate until we were all stuffed and couldn't believe how inexpensive our bill was, especially for such quality food! They'll be changing the menu regularly to match what is seasonally available and best so i can't wait to come back again & see what they come up with next! This place is exactly what the North Shore needed! It's not just another chain or mediocre bar food, it's locally owned and has a more upscale feel without going overboard! I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been. Food has been good. I ordered a chicken sandwich this time. I asked for grilled but received the other option. I didn't complain. 

Cool atmosphere. Front bar is misleading because the back bar is larger and that's really where most of the restaurant is located, along with a larger bar. 

I had average service the first time (sitting on back patio), and very poor service second time around. I sat at the bar and it was pretty slow. I had to grab my own silverware. I wasn't offered a second drink and my glass sat there on the bar empty for about a half hour. I finally was able to order a water after I ate.  I normally speak up but when the service is very poor at an establishment I become conflicted about giving the place more of my business.  

It was one of those experiences where the bartenders and servers were hanging out and mostly ignoring the patrons. 

Overall, good food and bad service kind of even out.  I'd go back but wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Our waitress was pretty bad which is a big reason I dropped the number of stars I gave. We sat in the nice outdoor patio area, but it took a while to be greeted and then 20 mins after that to receive our first beers. The next time we ordered beers it took forever to get those as well. I'm not sure what the hold up was because it didn't seem super busy. The food we ordered was pretty good - Meat plate, perogies, and grilled cheese. These were tasty, but I was impressed by the selection on the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place for dinner....all-in-all it was pretty good. They had a great beer list and the kale Caesar salad was very good. My husband got the cod which was tasty but not filling. The only real side to it was bok choy and he only got two small bulbs. The other side it was paired with was segmented, marinated grapefruit. Should have been a garnish but there was enough of it and nothing else that it was a side. I mean this isn't an a la carte establishment. The dish would have had more value for the price if it was paired with something...anything else! Rice, perhaps? I let my husband share my salad and fries as that dish was just not enough for a fairly hungry adult male. I'd like to say I'd be back but now just not sure if we can trust the other entrees...in that they will be just as small with odd pairings. We'll see how the restaurant progresses...as North Side dwellers we are in dire need of a decent yet affordable restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Foundry last Sunday for brunch and had a great time.  Good food,  2 large bars with plenty of seating and areas to hang out.  Great outside area on a nice day and dog friendly.  The kale caesar is a must, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I found the Foundry on yelp. I was looking for a place that was different yet still had some items that a picky eater could enjoy. First off, I love that it was located in the North Shore, the atmosphere down there is always nice especially with the other new restaurants that have been added down there. Now, getting to the restaurant...The foundry had an industrial feel. It was spacious, when we went it wasn't super busy at all..however, if it was busier, you wouldn't feel crowded with other guests around you. The service was pretty good and the servers and other employers there were friendly. The menu didn't have a ton of choices to choose from which was nice because when a menu has too many choices it can be overwhelming. They have a side of mac and cheese which was great. One of my favorite parts of my meal. We also got pierogies as a starter which were incredible. This is a place everyone needs to try if you're looking for a different place to eat and not just a chain!"}
{"text":"I came into Pittsburgh for the night for the annual Ohio University Christmas Party last November, and it was being hosted here. When I first got there, I thought that there was only one room in the front, but boy was I wrong - the place is freaking huge and super nice/new. We were situated in the back room with a long table right by the bar (perfect for OU Bobcats). The wait staff was super attentive and nice, considering there were about 30 of us who steadily got more and more drunk as the night progressed. They kept a constant variety of appetizers out for us to munch on, including a great meat/cheese tray and some delicious pumpkin pierogies. Thanks for the great service and the great night!"}
{"text":"Delicious food decen1t atmosphere with 2 bars! One quiet and one loud. My husband talks about this place all the time glad I finally got to try it ouy"}
{"text":"Excited to try The Foundry..   Friday night happy hour..  wasnt too crowded but figured the crowd probably ranges with whatever is happening in the north shore. I was glad it wasnt packed. I love the feel of Foundry.. really like the wood and urban feel.  You dont realize how big the establishment is walking in ..  theres a bar in the front area.. very cozy feel but walking down the hall to the back area..  complete dining space with plenty of seating and nice size bar.   Sat a the bar was greeted by the bartender \"Keith\" . .. want to give a shout out for great service and being so great with answering all my questions.  


FOOD:  I was surprised at the menu size and selection. I thought there would be a lot more options but not dis-crediting the menu.  Its just more typical to have more options but sometimes \"less is more\".  I had a feeling the prices would be above average and they were. 

Roasted pumpkin pierogis:   very different and good. Its not a dish I would get again. The portion is very small.  

I loved the grilled cheese.  This was impressive.. the cheese on it really made my taste buds sing.   The fries were good and definitely unforgettable.

There are some unique items on the menu such as a meat and cheese board! I love that.  

I really wanted to try the Korean fried wings but wish they weren't the whole wing.To drain i had the the VoodooBrewing - \"GranMet\" - Belgian Tripel -oh it was so tasty. 

PARKING: I parked in the lot behind Burgatory and for about three hours it was $7.00 not too bad.  

It was a great first experience at The Foundry Table and Tap.  This place is so ideal for a group gathering or happy hour.  I see another visit in the future."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the North Shore that is far from the mostly sports bar that are in this area.  We went on a Saturday night before a concert at Stage AE and it was not super crowded so we were seated right away.  They had a great draft list and some awesome cocktails. I was super excited to try the pumpkin sangria and disappointed that they were out.  I then went with the Victory Sour Monkey which is one of my favorite sour beers. The dinner menu was a bit limited but they have some good options of burgers, dinner entrees, apps, and salads.  I went with the burger which came with fresh greens, an orange marmalade, some sort of cheese all on a fresh bun.  I love that you have your choice of fries or a side salad. I went with the fresh greens and picked the blue cheese dressing which was one of the best salad dressing I have had in a while-def. homemade. My friend ordered the wings which are huge and messy! She also got the mac and cheese which is highly recommended. Our waitress was fantastic and even took us an added table when our waitress was busy with a large party.  Another thing I love about this place is the décor which is very rustic and has such a cozy feeling."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch and sat in the outdoor patio section. It was a cool spot along the river walk. I think there was a limited lunch menu (at least that's what it looked like). The choices weren't all that intriguing to me, but I was drawn to the burger. 

Cooked perfectly and the fries were really really good. Everyone at the table was happy with their meal and the cocktails were also very good. I thought it was a little pricey for lunch, but we were in the city. Definitely interested in checking out the full menu or dinner menu- if nothing else I'd go back for \"The Porch\" cocktail alone."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere with a great view of the water. A little loud, but we were there on a Friday night so that can be expected. Our party ordered the Foundry burger, pulled pork sandwich, roasted chicken, black cod, and grilled cheese - all of which were great! Our waitress was prompt and polite. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Foundry is a trendy restaurant located on the North Shore. My friends and I met here on a Sunday evening. It wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away. I started with the House Ale, which was a pale ale - just what I like! The table shared the pimento cheese dip. I actually liked this a lot. It was served with pickled vegetables and crackers! For my meal, I had the fried chicken breast sandwich. It was huge! But so delicious. The fries that were paired with my sandwich were also really good. I liked my meal and the atmosphere, but the rest of the menu were things I'm not crazy about ordering."}
{"text":"I have been twice, once in October for brunch/lunch, and once in September for dinner before a Cubs game. It was excellent food each time. At brunch I got their French toast, which was soaked in maple syrup and topped with a cheesecake sauce. Simple delicious. In September I got their pierogies and pulled pork. Again, delicious. The food is worth the price and they are a great find on the North Side."}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve at 6. Overall the experience was just ok. The food is too expensive for the quality. Our server was nice but never came around and we had dirty plates on our table the entire 2 hour experience. Never offered refills. Some of the food was warm at best. Do not order the bone marrow. It is tiny. The cheese board has some decent items but not worth 15 dollars. Our dessert was 9 dollars and not worth it. Overall the food was decent but our experience was worse."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I've been a few times. The food is good overall (except for the popcorn, skip that!). But the service has been consistently poor and was particularly bad at this visit. We had a 7:15 reservation for dinner and plans to be at an event from 9-10 a few blocks away. Service was so slow we ended up not making it to our event! We had to flag down the server for any attention and she was next to impossible to find. I don't know where she was hiding. We had the manager come over to answer a question about a promotional deal we got (a free drink/snack coupon from a prior visit that I got due to bad service at that visit) and, while he honored the coupon, he didn't even acknowledge our poor experience. This was the third strike, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"First time here. Love the decor, very industrial/farm style. The burger was excellent and service was great too. I also ordered the Regal drink, tasted like a Carmel Apple and it was pretty good. Everyone I came with enjoyed everything they ordered. Lots of outdoor space, we will be back when the weather warms up!"}
{"text":"Beer selection predictable. Like pilsner, so ended up drinking Stella. I had the burger, not the worst, but not the best.  Had fried cauliflower, greasy without breading or flavor. S.o.had chicken sandwich, OK, not good or bad. All in ok,wish I had made reservations elsewhere."}
{"text":"This review is for the front bar only and for Nicki, the bartender. Came in on a Friday night and it was dead, and it's because it was only 9 days old when we visited, not because it's terrible. Folks, check this place out!

From the outside, it looks like a tiny bar, but there are plenty of tables and another bar in the back. It's actually quite large and spacious, and well-decorated. 

The drinks were awesome!! The bartender was awesome!! She created several drinks off the menu that were absolutely perfect. On top of being a great mixologist, she had a great personality and talked to us like we've all been long time friends. 

Such a positive experience at the bar that I can't wait to come back to try the food!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a whim when walking through the North Shore - I was looking for a cool place with outdoor seating and a view of the river. The Foundry checks all of those boxes. The inside decor is very trendy cool with an industrial vibe. There was a bar in the front of the restaurant with some seating, and a huge dining area with a second larger bar in the back. I feel like there might have even been more space than that - it was seriously so big. 

The outdoor patio is your standard Pittsburgh patio, but the view of the river is a nice, and their chairs are comfy. They do have umbrellas, but if its too windy they will blow away so they are weather depending. 

They have a lot of beer to chose from, and a list of signature cocktails that could satisfy anyone's cravings, and they have a decent wine selection as well but I didn't pay attention to that side of it. I got the whippet mixed drink, and I was so happy with it I got a second one. The food menu was sadly very small, and it was tough to chose something I wanted that wasn't like $30 for lunch. I went with the fried chicken sandwich. I was so happy that I did. I got the jalepeno slaw on the side because I am a sissy when it comes to spice, but it was SO good. It was on a poppy seed bun, which was a nice touch and the side salad I got with it was good too. Just basic greens with some edible flowers. Nothing too crazy. 

All in all, this was a 4 star experience - in addition to me thoroughly enjoying my food, the service was great too. I will say, it was a little pricier than I would have expected, but we were close to Heinz Field, Stage AE, PNC park  and near the river so I'm not complaining too much."}
{"text":"This place is a little confusing. Some stuff is really really good, but then other stuff, it is like why am i paying so much money for so little food. 

We had the salad, a chicken sandwich, brussel sprouts, smores dessert and fried cauliflower:

the salad was a joke. It was like 4 pieces of lettuce. 
the chicken sandwich was HUGE definitely worth it
the sprouts and cauliflower were great too.
the smores dessert was like 2 oz of paste and a burnt marshmallow.... ummm just no

Maybe they aren't done figuring out their menu?"}
{"text":"Hit this place up after a Steelers Game! Although it was packed, we were greeted right away. The food was delicious and the drinks good as well Service was great!"}
{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint. The Foundry has a great atmosphere and a friendly staff. There was a good draft selection as this is listed as a tap room. The food was also excellent and arrived to the table with ingredients that were obviously farm to table. Best of all when I received my  bill I was pleasantly surprised. If you want a good drink selection and good fresh food, then this is your place."}
{"text":"It was fine.  I had the market salad and a beer - both were good, but not amazing, and definitely not $20 worth. 

I did really like the cheese in the salad, but wish there was a crouton of some sort, because it needed a crunch element. 

I do really appreciate how great the service was -  very quick (and they were hosting my running group, so about 30-40 people) - very fun ambiance with outdoor as well as indoor seating.  It looked like there was a nice area for groups inside as well."}
{"text":"Not bad not amazing and a little pricy; over ok experience would go back but would not run back"}
{"text":"Not bad. Not amazing. Went during the summer so maybe winter would be more reasonable/less busy? Good tap list. Tasty cocktail. The menu was somewhat2d. The service was a bit forgetful and absent. F'd up my order. Wasn't heartbroken. Just not raging to return."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Food was extremely overpriced. Paid $24 for a cut of steak that is $3.99 at Giant Eagle. It was served with \"caramelized\" Brussels sprouts that were hardly cooked, I've made them ten times better at home. We also got an order of fries that were served cold. I had high hopes for this place, but definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome venue! Messaged the manager ahead of time to see if they could accommodate a large party for my sister's birthday-they responded quickly and enthusiastically. Really impressed with their flexibility too; I had to call on three separate occasions to change the time for my ridiculously indecisive family members. :p This kindness extended into our dining experience: our server was the absolute best! She was very personable and acutely sensitive to a family member's special needs. Unfortunately, her name escapes me-otherwise I would shower her with compliments in this review. Regardless, I hope the management can use this as encouragement for their servers in the ongoing battle of customer service. :) All in all, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was chill. Ill def be back."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Foundry before the Pitt home opener. The place is gorgeous. Small bar upfront with a rustic/industrial feel. Follow the hallway down and The Foundry just keeps revealing more of its awesome atmosphere. For such a large place, it feels quite intimate. Rotating beers on tap, wine and cocktail menu. 
I ordered a Bloody Mary** which was mixed very well and my friend ordered a glass of wine. Nice selections to choose on the menu. 
We opted for three small plates so we could maximize what we were trying. The roasted tomato pierogis were delicious. I never would have paired tomato in a pierogi. The sauerkraut side with it was a nice touch. I think adding two more pierogis to the dish for the price would be optimal. 
The duck fried nuts...oh my. Totally decadent. A real treat! The thyme was a nice compliment. A little sea salt added to the dish would make that really pop!
The pork belly bites. Let me tell you this...when there is pork (especially the belly) on a menu, I'm ordering it. These were definitely my favorite. The crispy edges topped with the fresh jalapeño made the perfect marriage!
We sat at the bar and our service was excellent and I think the prices are somewhat fair. 

Not bad at all for only being open a week! Can't wait to try more on the menu. If you're looking for great food and drink that's not going to break the bank in the North Shore, get here! 

**The Bloody Mary was really good, but I think needs a signature garnish. Topping one of those with a lemon/lime, jalapeño, pork belly bite and either hot, pickled green bean or okra would really knock it out of the park!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever ... Mandy the bartender was not friendly in anyway clueless of everyone around her I came in with a group of six people and was treated very badly. She should not  be a Bartender horrible customer service. They vibe of this bar was very strange and like I started the service was awful we had a table and was never served so we had to go up to the bar and then stood there for 10-15 mins and still didn't get any attention or even a hi while serving other guest it wasn't until  we r about to walk out the door that she finally got ready to serve us so we left! don't go here there are lot of other friendly bars better then this pretentious place"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were seated quick when we came on a weekend, they were busy though. We ordered drinks & food. The beer was good, and I got a burger. It was my favorite burger I have had in a very long time. Can't wait to go back. It was cooked perfectly. I like pink in my burger. Couldn't be happier. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a few of my friends because where we wanted to go was an hour wait for a table. The drink menu is bigger than the food menu, not much of a selection. The menu was very creative but not too much of a selection. Our server seemed like it was her first weekend after training, tried to give her benefit of the doubt. 
We decided we were going to be adventurous and try some things off the menu. My Caesar salad was great! My friends pickled chicken sandwich was good, her bf ordered a medium burger and it came out well done with a flag on it that said \"medium\" and missing the bacon he ordered. My bf got a grilled cheese that was awful. It was burnt, minimal cheese, covered in butter and burnt bacon. Somewhat disappointed in the food for having such a unique menu. Wouldn't recommend for food, but the decor is beautiful. We only had beer, so I can't comment on cocktails. Hope this helps"}
{"text":"I hope this place does well because I loved it. We went this past Friday night around 8:30-9 and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Needless to say the service was fantastic. The atmosphere was great too. We ordered the pork belly bites which were pretty bland in my opinion. The texture was good and they had spice from the jalapeños but heat doesn't always equal flavor. Maybe a touch of salt? Anyway I ordered the grilled cheese and fries and it was amazing! Cheesy from the cheddar, creamy from the boursin, and cooked to perfection. We probably would have stayed longer for a few drinks but like I said, it wasn't too lively for a Friday night. Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends on Friday evening for dinner & drinks. The beverage list had a nice mix of cocktails, wine & craft beers. We also ordered several food items. I definitely would suggest the Brussels Sprouts. The cheese board was also very good. Other's in the party ordered wings & grilled cheese and said they were okay. The interior of restaurant is very warm and inviting with reclaimed barn wood tables and seating. We actually liked it so much we planned a brunch at the end of the month for brunch. I hope they can establish a nice customer base. It is not crazy busy as of yet. Maybe just need to get word out!!!"}
{"text":"I love farm to table restaurants so I was excited to try this one. Pretty disappointing. My wife is dairy free which limited her choices but typically works out okay. The chef adapted the fried chicken sandwich to be dairy free, while very nice was dry and lacked flavor. It did have an unusual spice on it, maybe cardamom, which was interesting but not enough to make it good. The fries, which people rave about in other reviews, were pretty tasty but still just French fries. Pork belly bites are good and even better, when paired with the brisket hash, although both needed salt to bring out the flavors. The highlight of my wife's meal was the drink She had, The Monroe. Light and refreshing. Go for drinks not for food."}
{"text":"A great marriage between modern and western, this place knows how to prepare a delectable dish. I had the beet salad and fries, a friend got the pork belly, and someone else had the Brussels sprouts, which I wish I would have had. SO. GOOD. I will say, not a lot of vegan/veg options, so come ready to try new things. The goat cheese in my salad was he perfect accent and although I didn't try the pork belly, my friend said she enjoyed it but it was a little spicy for her liking. My husband and I each got fries, without realizing they were $4 each...they were good, but I've had large baskets of fries cheaper than that, so I thought it to be a tad expensive. 

Service was just ok- a little confusion in the end with checks, and didn't have as many beers as some places nearby,  but it's extremely spacious inside and plenty of TVs to catch a game or just hang with friends. Loved the purse hooks under the bar, and it looked like a divider would be able to close if someone were to schedule a private party off the side room. Something to keep in mind for the future."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at the Foundry with a group of 12 on a Saturday evening. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Service was inconsistent, sometimes the server was quite attentive while other times she disappeared for a half hour at a time. The beer selection was not vast but the choices were all interesting and high quality. The food was good however the portions were on the small side considering this is a gastropub. Many were disappointed by the limited meat and cheese platter - definitely not a good value. The burgers were good but not especially unique considering the norm these days."}
{"text":"The Foundry is an excellent little lunch place on the North Shore. I stopped in with 3 co-workers for lunch on a dead-as-disco Friday afternoon. There was no games and the state of the dining room reflected that, with only a few occupied tables. The waitress brought us waters, and then proceeded to disappear for quite a while. This would become an unfortunate trend. Once we finally ordered, I got the chicken sandwich with fries, my coworkers got the pierogis, pulled pork sandwich and side salads. What followed was a very, very long wait for our food. So much so that we had to flag down the bar tender to ask what the deal was. Someone followed up and told us it would be out in 5 minutes and sure enough, there was the food 5 minutes later. It was, however for another table. After another round of waiting, our food came out with an apology that they \"are still getting their food times right.\" 

Here is the catch, the food was ABSOLUTELY fantastic. The chicken sandwich, while a little messy, was the perfect blend of flavors. The pickles, dressing and breading all positively sung in harmony with the chicken and the bun. The perogis received very favorable reviews as well, and the pulled pork was an uncontested hit. The best thing on the table, however, were the frites. Crispy on the outside, warm and perfect inside, these taters were the stars of the show. They're lightly salted and seasoned and oh so damn good. I shared my order with the table and we all agreed they were top notch.

The waitstaff brought us our checks quickly thereafter. It's also worth mentioning that the prices here are very reasonable, especially when stacked up against Asiagos and Bar Louie, where dollar amount doesn't necessarily equal quality. 

I highly recommend The Foundry. Once they get their kitchen sorted, this will be one of the best places on the North Shore to eat."}
{"text":"We came to Foundry's for brunch a couple of Sundays ago.  I made reservations but it wasn't necessary.  The restaurant is very large and can accommodate big groups easily.  This particular day I believe there was a private party in the room next to the bar, as I saw the Steeler's game being projected onto the wall and several people.

We opted to sit at the huge bar in the back.  Note there are two bars.  The inside of the place is very clean, sleek, and modern.  Our bartender/waitress was very pleasant and made us aware of their bloody Mary bar that they offer on the weekends.  The bar had a decent amount of selections to doll up your bevvy, though I missed the additional hot sauce.  After I made my Bloody the bartender walked by with a tray of bacon and offered me my fill since it was supposed to be on the bar.  I don't usually eat bacon, but when I do it's at brunch with a bloody.  Such a nice salty compliment to a spicy acidic drink.

For my meal we opted to share an order of the pumpkin pierogis, and for my entrée I chose Cap \"N\" Benedict.  The benny stated it came with hash browns and I inquired if they were deep fried since I don't like deep fried food.  She said they were pan fried which depending can be acceptable.  Upon delivery I felt not only the hash browns were terribly hard and tasteless and added nothing to the dish.  One bite of them and I pushed them to the side.  Not good.  The rest of the dish was pretty tasty but the portion was small for $12.00 especially since the triangle hash browns were terrible.  I was very happy we ordered the pierogis, which were different but good, otherwise I would have still been very hungry.

We spent the better part of the afternoon watching the game and indulging in a few brunch beverages.  Our check was steep, but we did have a good time.  I would like to come back especially since the place is in a great location in regards to the stadiums and it's a nice open clean space.  The food was good, but it could use some tweaking with some ingredients, portions, or price.  Service on the other hand was very good."}
{"text":"Drinks were good for me but a little too strong for my girlfriend's liking. Service was terrible. Took forever to get the waitresses attention and our drinks took about 20 minutes to get. I got their grouper (I think it was the grouper because the waitress told me here's your cod and when I told her I got the grouper she said oh yeah whatever it's fish). The grouper was good full of flavor. They had some good specials on happy hour so I might be back to drink at the bar but I wouldn't recommended sitting down here to eat"}
{"text":"This new restaurant in AMAZING.  I wish I could give it ten stars. The food is the star of this place. This is NOT sports bar food, The food is fresh, high quality and very creative.  We went  the first weekend they were open for my wife's  birthday.  We ordered 
2 cocktails which were excellently crafted. The tomato pierogies were unique and light. The small plate duck fried spiced nuts were delicious. We loved the macaroni and cheese with pork BBQ. Hands down the best I have ever had. The BBQ was slightly sweet, which added to the Mac and Cheese. My wife loved the grilled cheese with 3 or 4 cheeses in it. I had the Black Cod. This is just outstanding, prepared with oranges and coconut and tamarind glaze. As good as any high end seafood restaurant preparation, if not better!  I had fresh baked corn that clearly was cut from the cob. Fresh and tasty.  For dessert we had Smores.....kind of a deconstructed version.....phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great meal. I imagine during a sporting event it might be loud, but we were there during a very pleasant early evening.  If they are this good their first week, I can't imagine how they will be in a couple months. Cannot  wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good beer list and great food. The service was a little slow, but we figured they are still figuring things out.

Everything we tasted was creative and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich, which is their most popular entree.  Fries were excellent and so were the pumpkin Pierogies.

We were hoping to drink the Space Dust on tap, but it was out when we arrived. 

In all, an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Don't eat at the Foundry on the North Side.  The food was spoiled and moldy, and the service was mediocre.  

We saw 90% of the people who sat down get up and leave due to lack of service.  When someone finally took (and wrote down) our order, they had to come back some time afterwards to ask for it again.  They were out of menu items, and yet still charged for them just because you asked about them.  Even the utensils came out after the food.  At that point, you're so hungry you don't notice the state of the food until you've already eaten some.  And yes, I did feel sick afterwards.  

Just don't go.  I don't know how this place is still in business, and hasn't been investigated by the Health Department."}
{"text":"First time ever at The Foundry.... probably my last. Took my daughter there for a quick bite and a drink before a concert at Stage AE.  We left plenty of time and quite honestly, didn't care about the opening band. Daughter ordered perogies (three of them) and I ordered a side of Brussels sprouts. After considerable waiting, it was apparent to our waiter that this taking way too long as he volunteered to comp our food. He did indicate the food was on its way out. Twenty minutes later, we bailed out as the headliner for the show was beginning. This place was not that busy that it took over 90 minutes (and still waiting...) to get two sides.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I may have to give this place a try another time because I did not enjoy the food as much as many other reviewers have. Our waitress was great! She was friendly and personable, she was attentive, and she was quite enthusiastic about several menu items. Perhaps I just took the wrong suggestions from her.  

I had the Foundry Burger, which came with the choice of a salad on the side (among other choices). I will say that the ranch dressing on the salad tasted homemade. It was delicious and unlike other \"traditional\" ranch dressings you get when you order a basic side salad at most other places. I ordered my burger medium and it came that way, but something about the mixture of ingredients did not taste great to me. It could have been the mushrooms mixed with the type of cheese, or the caramelized onions mixed with the flavor of the mushrooms.... I ate all of it because i was quite hungry and it wasn't terrible by any means. It just was not something I would order again. All in all, it was an okay dinner experience."}
{"text":"Three of us went here on a Saturday evening when there was no pirate game. There were plenty of seats available. We sat in the inside area although they have a very pleasant outside dining area. The dining room contains more televisions than you could shake a stick at. This is not necessarily a good thing. The chairs at the tables for were little bit uncomfortable. We were welcomed by our server pretty quickly. We started with the pimento cheese appetizer. It is served with pickled vegetables and a few Rittz crackers. Although the dip is served cold, it is served in ac skillet.  The pi- Mento cheese was tasty and the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to that. It was nothing special but it was good. The restaurant bills itself as a farm to table venue. Menu is reasonably diverse. They have risotto and lamb and fish and sandwiches. In that sense, we didn't really give it a fair shake, because we all ordered grilled cheese sandwiches. We had seen reviews that said they were very good. We also got macaroni and cheese and deep fried brussels sprouts. The deep fried brussels sprouts were delicious they were in kind of a hot - Asian inspired sauce and had some peanuts sprinkled over them. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and average.  Some at our table thought it tasted like Kraft macaroni and cheese and for some people that's a really good thing. The french fries that accompanied the grilled cheese were very very good not coated or anything. The grill cheese sandwichesThemselves suffer from a lack of flavor. They are made from Boursin and cheddar cheeses and somehow that does not amount to much in a grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was really good and they were cooked very well. Our server was very attentive. Although it's not a fair sampling of the menu, we all agreed that we would not go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"Limited menu, a bit overpriced for what you're getting. My food was never brought out with the rest of the party, and I received my meal once everyone was finished. They did comp my dinner. The pork shoulder sandwich was just not good.  The burger was good once I got it.  Really nice cocktail selection - very tasty options.  Overall, I won't return. There are better options on the North Shore."}
{"text":"A reliable brunch spot that offers something on the menu to please everyone in the group. Good for a family meal, meeting up with friends, or a casual outing with colleagues. Highlights include solid brunch fare, Bloody Mary bar, ample room, friendly service, industrial decor, and plenty of TV sports coverage. The location features river views, seasonal outdoor seating, and easy walking to stadiums, Carnegie Science Center, and Stage AE. Parking is challenging, as it is for most North Shore destinations."}
{"text":"The Foundry has an industrial feel. There are two bars which is nice and the back bar has TVs surrounding it which makes it a great place to catch a game. The dining area is large and well kept. They even have a nice little patio overlooking the river. The pork belly bites are a must try. The meat is packed with flavor and he bourbon glaze really gives it that something extra. The grilled cheese is also worth having, with bacon, of course. The Lancaster cheddar really sets it apart and the bread is toasted just enough. The pierogis are also very well done. I had the Yukon potato pierogis that has an excellent mustard crème fraiche and the caramelized onions were also very flavorful. I'm usually not a huge fan of sauerkraut but their crispy sauerkraut was a welcome addition to the already excellent pierogis."}
{"text":"This place was great. Was walking along the river and found some outdoor seating here. It took a little while for someone to find us outside but once they did our waitress was great, super friendly. They have a decent draft list. I needed a snack and the Brussel sprouts really hit the spot,  they have peanuts on them. Checked out the inside, this place is fairly big inside. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Nice place but service is horrible. The keep coming up with why things are slow and the issues they have, new bartender, short in the kitchen...., but that should not be customer facing. Still a neat place and a good location but I would think twice before I came back. If they get it together they have the potential to a great place but time will tell."}
{"text":"Ditto most of the previous review. The place has potential and the prices are good. I can't give any of the food superlatives, but it was better than many of the federal street places near PNC Park. Definitely looking for a different crowd than Asiago. We did have problems with the wait time. We didn't expect 1.5 hours for lunch, especially burgers and chicken sandwiches. Only real food fail were 2 burgers ordered medium well that came rare even after the long wait.I can't give two thumbs to the fries as they were broken pieces in a tin cup. They were cute but not worth getting out the thesaurus to describe their deliciousness.  Being perfectly fair the manager apologized and took the burger meals off the check, which was the right way to treat a customer, and appreciated. 
They have only been open 5 days so I expect they need and deserve some time to work out the kitchen kinks. I'll try them again."}
{"text":"This place seems to be a big step up from the other chain restaurants surrounding the stadiums on the North Shore.  The Korean Fried Chicken was my personal favorite- the flavor was fantastic although I could see why some would say the prices are high for the portions. But when a place calls itself a gastropub I don't think that should be a surprise. The pickle-brined chicken was awesome (but definitely not enough chicken on that huge bun) and the french fries were some of the best around.

The beer selection was great from a visitor's perspective with quite a few local beers but a lot of the taps are full of the typical big breweries masquerading as craft brew. The major downside was that service took forever when we came in on a Monday at 1:30 and didn't get out of there until 3... I would hate to see what it would be like on a game day or any typical dining period."}
{"text":"Okay. Stick with me.... Upon entrance, nobody greeted us. Even when someone did come to seat the two people in front of us, they did not acknowledge us, no \"hello we will be right with you\".  We waited in the entryway for at least 10 minutes. Bartender even walked by and did not say hello. Finally hostess sat us. We went to the back of the Restaurant.... It's overlooking the river. There's a very huge bar and it is a very huge establishment. It also has outdoor seating. Our server greeted us and we ordered the cheese spread with pickled onions, pickled cauliflower and pickles, served with Ritz crackers. Pretty damn tasty. I ordered the short ribs, a huge piece of meat, too much for me to eat, but it is currently all in my belly. My fabulous sexy husband ordered the tagliatelle pasta dish with the sage, walnuts and butternut squash. It was topped with breadcrumbs or Ritz crackers. It was OK, it was way way too salty. For cocktails I had a cahpirhinia, yay! Bartender actually knew how to make one. Sexy Husband had a Brazilian mule, made with Casacha. Server took away our appetizer and I didn't know until I looked for it . But I want you to know the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. We made our way up to the bar to watch the hockey game. I will come back again and can't wait for summer to sit outside and have a delicious cahpirinia and some more food. I love discovering new places in the city. We have only been here for six years and we have found fabulous places to eat... Rock on..."}
{"text":"Our bartender, Jordan was extremely friendly and nice. I'm so happy I took my parents to this place because their beer selection is fantastic and Jordan made our visit very special by not only helping us to find the best beers but also by entertaining us. Definitely recommend every beer lover to stop by!"}
{"text":"Quite a lackluster experience that I'll chalk up to growing pains. Hopefully they will get their game together relatively soon.

I came here for dinner with a friend. We sat on the outside patio on a nice October day. The first problem was no hostess being there when we first walked in. So we walked back toward the bar and were confused. At that point, they had us walk all the way back to find a hostess and then walk forward again. I wish they would have been able to seat us instead of going through this dance.

Ordered the pork belly bites for the appetizer. These were alright. Quite dry, despite the nice oil at the bottom and the bits of jalapenos. The appetizer was A-OK. I ordered a burger from my entree with a side of cauliflower bites, while my friend ordered The Grouper.

My burger was fine. It was cooked medium rare, which was awesome, but the amount of meat was underwhelming. The burger was mostly bread. The buns were nice and toasted, but as you bit into the burger: the overwhelming flavor was the bun. Way too much bread and too little beef. The fries were delicious and the cauliflower bites was the highlight of the meal.

My friend ordered the Grouper. He was severely disappointed. I was even disappointed for him. They gave him like a 3oz piece of it. It was so small and the most expensive item on their menu! Such a ridiculously small portion. It was almost insulting. If they are going to serve such small portions, they should definitely either say how many oz's are going to be served on the menu or have the waiter/waitress warn you.

The side salad he asked for never came. He was under the impression it would be a side as the Grouper came on a bed of greens, but didn't really have any sides. When the side salad came, it was a bunch of measly lettuce and a few grape tomatoes with a heaping of dressing. And they charged us $5 for it. Ouch.

The coffee I asked for, the waitress spilt on our table. No big deal at all. However, the coffee was lukewarm. Which was probably a good thing because otherwise there would have been some injuries. The waitress apologized for spilling coffee and overall was pleasant, but never asked us how our meal was. We didn't bother contesting the $5 salad charge because we were in a hurry to get out of there.

Overall, I could see this place being nice once they get the kinks worked out, but my feedback would be:

1) Have a better system in place in case customers miss the hostess, especially with such a large area.

2) Uh, please fix your portion sizes, especially for your higher priced items. You're not a fine dining restaurant that serves 3oz pieces of fish for $26. Makes no sense. Even for your burger, if you're not going to increase the size of the beef -- decrease the size of the buns.

What you're doing right:

1) Burger was cooked medium rare. The beef tasted as it was fresh and high quality. Yay! Fries and cauliflower bites are delicious!

I hope this feedback is helpful. I haven't necessarily crossed this place off my list next time I visit, but I'd definitely be careful about ordering expensive plates of fish if I were you without double checking that they would feed a moderately hungry person."}
{"text":"THIS IS THAT REVIEW! I wish I had stars for different things- stopped in after the Steeler/Bengals game- Everywhere else was PACKED- Hostess gets a 10 - we asked about the wait - she said 30 minutes but encouraged us to come in to the bar which was crowded but we could move- actually found seats for 5 - NOTE TO OWNERS Bartender needs help - GREAT guy working his butt off both behind the bar and in front- we ended up with a table unless than 15 minutes- Great Table! Lots of tables about half full so busy but not slammed. However OWNERS YOU NEED MORE SERVERS! No service for well over 15-20 minutes- we finally got up and asked for a server and a very nice BUSY young man finally took our order! That was bad, we were so hungry and got really cranky! And then in less than 10 minutes our food arrived ALL at once hot and Delicious - One of our best meals in Pitt. We had the oysters, the pulled pork and I had the grilled cheese with bacon.  Everything was Great!  Once fed I began watching the flow - we had only 2 waiters for about 20 tables - not all full but really NOT enough staff- our waiter never returned to bring our check (because he was sooooo busy getting guests fed!) that we had to go find our check - we gave him a great tip because he really was doing all he could do - so staff 10 stars Food 10+ Stars Staffing person 1 Star - note to Owners - I know your new but STAFF UP!! It's better to have to pay a few extra employees while working out the kinks than have paying guests leave because of understaffing - Your wine list is better than most - Your Beer choices are good - I love the water bottles on the table and (although I had to go to the bar to get more water) I was very happy to receive 2 pre filled, cold bottles - your FOOD is AMAZING and so nice to have several waiters deliver the entire table hot food all at once.  The Foundry is welcome option to the North side - we will defiantly be back and hope your staffing issues are fixed."}
{"text":"Great place in the north shore. Decent beer list... smaller menu but everything I've had so far has been absolutely terrific.  The fancy corn is great! The burger is one of the best I've had recently.  All around a great place to stop for a beer and some food!"}
{"text":"The Foundry atmosphere is really unique.  The cocktails were exceptional.  It was obvious they were made with good alcohol and fresh ingredients.  We tried the wings which literally fell off the bones and were very tasty.  Our table had salad and sandwiches and everyone enjoyed their food.  I would recommend it and I will be stopping there again prior to games for a another Harlow cocktail."}
{"text":"Do you like locally sourced food? Do you like atmosphere? Then the answer is simple: come here immediately.  Just show up. 

I took no photos because I was too busy eating it. The food was DELICIOUS. Our server was a delight. We came for brunch and she brought over the dinner menu and told us all of her favorite things. 

I have decided to make a punch card for myself and literally cross off what I've had so I can be sure to try it all! 

I cannot wait to come for dinner. Who's in!?"}
{"text":"The North Shore has picked up its social scene quite a bit these past few years by adding more and more bars and restaurants. One place I have been itching to try, and haven't, is The Foundry. I've heard great things about it, so I wanted to experience it myself. 

I ended up meeting a friend there for some drinks after work. I was pleasantly surprised with the modern/barnyard aesthetic that the place had to offer upon entry. It's very industrial looking and plays towards the \"now\" type of look, which is good in my opinion. The place has two bars and a large dining area. it also has an outdoor patio on the river, which will be ideal for the spring and summer months. 

We got to the bar right before happy hour ended at 6pm. I got a beer for around $4. The bar had a $6 happy hour apps menu. However, their apps aren't your typical bar food. They have things like duck-fried nuts and pork belly bites. I opted for their duck confit haluski. Yes, there was duck in it! Tasted just like pulled pork. It was even topped with a fried egg. My buddy got the grilled cheese, which looked amazing. He then ended up getting their mac n' cheese, which I tried a bite of. Pure heaven. 

The bartender was super nice and suggested some great drink choices. They had a sweeter strawberry ale, but I thought it was too sweet to drink alone, so the bartender recommended for me to get half of that mixed with half of a hefeweizen-type beer. It was dynamite. I even got the chance to talk with the owner who was super chill. He told me about their Saturday and Sunday brunches that have a bloody mary bar! 

I definitely had an enjoyable experience and plan on going back soon whether that's for happy hour, dinner, or brunch. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 5 stars but our waitress ruined that... My boyfriend and I stopped here last weekend for lunch but it was during a Pitt game and the brunch menu was so limiting. So we stopped back this past Saturday night for dinner. I absolutely LOVE the decor and everything they've done to the inside - the walls, the lighting, the tables, the ceiling, everything. Our waitress brought us over waters and asked if we wanted anything else to drink but didn't have much time to look at the drink menu so she said she'd come back.... It took her about 10 minutes to come back to us. I asked for a White Lightening and again, she came back in about 10 minutes to say they were out of it and asked if wanted something else. Her excuse for taking so long is that she had a \"large party\" to take care of.... I picked a different beer and she came back much quicker. She offered to take the beer off the bill because it took so long to get... which, we came out to buy dinner and spend money so that wasn't a thought that crossed our minds, we just wanted quicker service at that point. We ordered the pork belly bites - AMAZING. We could have ordered 5 more bowls. Those came out fairly quick as someone from the kitchen brought them to us. I got the BBQ pork mac & cheese - delicious! Just the right amount of everything. My boyfriend ordered the pickle-brined fried chicken - awesome! They are spot on with all of the food. After we were done eating, we sat for what felt like 20 minutes before we had to get up and ask someone else for our check. The manager brought us our check and apologized but gave the excuse they were \"understaffed\". I understand if you don't have enough people working but it should be a priority not to ignore you guests Our waitress didn't even apologize - which isn't a huge deal but come on.... The table of 2 next to us sat after us, got their food before us, and paid/left before us as well. 

I would go again but not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Good draft selection. Burger and Fried Chicken Sandwich were both really good.  The menu is different than what you'll find at other places on the north shore. Great place!"}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews, and unfortunately this time it's because we had a horrible experience.  

It started well with us being asked to move outside because it was unseasonably warm for October and they accommodated us.  After that though, it was all downhill.  It took us a half hour to get our drinks.  The beer menu is average for what's on tap.  No sours on tap, but whatever, I ordered a grapefruit beer that they were out of.  We ordered apps that we waited and waited for. We asked where they were and got a \"let me check\" like we were bothering our waitress.  Not 30 seconds later our entrees came out.  No one was crazy about their food.  My fish was way sweeter than the menu let on.  Another thought the chicken sandwich was overdone, my wife said the steak was just okay.  Also \"okay\" brussel sprouts. My wife thought the cauliflower was good, I thought it was just average. We thought the pork belly bites, beet salad, and meat and cheese platters were good. Not one of us loved their entree. They did comp us for the apps because they came out after the entrees so we appreciated that.  Service was below average.  Food was below average.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for game day. 
We recently went here before the Penn St at Pitt football game. 
For a noon kickoff, they opened at 8:30 am. 
We were sitting for breakfast( no breakfast food here but the full menu was available) by 8:45 with drinks and ESPN in the TVs. 

It was crowed around the bar but the dining tables were available and we were not rushed to vacate the table. The food was good. The Tot-chos were good. Nachos with a tater tot base. 

Also good was the mac n cheese and the burgers. 

Try this place for Pitt or Steelers games as well as Pirates games or if you are just in the area"}
{"text":"We had to wait a while at the empty hostess stand before being seated, but it was worth it. The restaurant has a great atmosphere (industrial chic) and is bigger than it seems. The wait staff was excellent, and so was our food. 

Definitely get the duck-fried nuts!"}
{"text":"Excellent grub right on the waterfront.  Highly recommend this new joint.  Ask for Amanda.  She was excellent!  Fast service and awesome cocktails.  Ate on the patio and had a rockin burger.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"We had our Engagement party (in lieu of a bridal shower) at the Foundry last June. From the menu planning to setting up the day of, the staff at the Foundry were incredible. Andrew was the primary contact for us. He helped us pick our menu selection (the salmon and creamed cauliflower were a hit with all who attended), as well as coordinate the open bar (the foundry offers a few bar set ups, including cash bar, drink tickets, and limits). Don't hesitate to consider them for an event for 50+ attendees. We had 55 for a sit down event and there was plenty of room for more."}
{"text":"Great food and pleasant service! The Founders Burger was juicy and cooked just right and the side garden salad was made of a mix of various lettuces, sprouts, and flowers that looked as though they were just picked. The beer selection was good but a little pricy in my opinion. I'm not from the area but I feel like $8-9 dollars is a lot. Still, for a hungry traveler just looking for a bite to eat and a light summer beer to sip on by the river, this definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a Pirates game for drinks and snacks. The beer/wine/whiskey  menu is very extensive, and they have a ton of different cocktails to choose from. 

We decided on the heirloom popcorn and the duck-fried nuts to munch on. I have to say, I wasn't crazy about either one. We didn't taste anything on the popcorn except chipotle dust (though the menu ingredients also listed lime, salt, and cotija cheese); the popcorn was very dry and there wasn't much of it! The nut mix had almonds, cashews, peanuts, and a few walnuts, and they just tasted greasy. No flavor at all was distinguishable, not even salt, though again we were supposed to be able to taste thyme, salt, garlic, and chili flakes. 

We didn't try any of the entrees as we had eaten earlier in the day but I have to say I am not even eager to try the entrees, unfortunately. Aside from the beautiful rustic decor and very attentive waitress, there wasn't much about this place that got me excited or eager to eat, especially after the disappointing snacks. There were not a ton of people there (even though neighboring places were packed with baseball fans) and a small menu. I think I'll just move on to the long list of other establishments in the area that I haven't yet tried! I had to give a couple stars for the beautiful decor & our waitress was also awesome!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is really rustic and its exciting to see this kind of pub come to Pittsburgh. It reminds me of Denver bars a lot. I had the pork mac n' cheese as well as the grilled cheese with bacon during my visits and I highly recommend both. There cocktail menu is diverse and well priced ( I recommend the Whippet!). This will be my new spot for Steeler games and brunches for sure!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the North Shore restaurant and bar scene!  Located across from Stage AE The Foundry is a beautifully designed and decorated space that is convenient to Heinz Field and PNC Park.  

I was here over a holiday weekend mid-day so I will be interested to see the place hopping before a sporting event.  The entrance is unique in that there is a small bar at the entrance of the restaurant.   Have a drink while you wait to be seated and then you'll walk down a long hallway and into the main dining area that holds a huge central bar and abundant dining space.  Additionally they have a huge sliding barn door that opens to extra seating that could also could be used for private events.  There is also ample seating available on the patio overlooking the river.  Beautiful view of downtown!  

There is a nice selection of beers on tap and being an IPA lover I was NOT disappointed.  Nice West Coast (Green Flash!) selection and also one of my faves from the mid-west, Goose Island.  There is also a lengthy list of cocktails, and I tasted my sister in law's drink, The Harlow, which was very smooth and sweet.

For an appetizer we shared the duck-fried nuts - which was tasty and plentiful for the three of us.  This is a great accompaniment to your cocktail.  For my main dish I had the pulled pork, which was served on my preferred bun - pretzel, and also had a nice garnish of red cabbage.  Very tasty and a really good sized portion.  Service was friendly and quick.  

The food and drinks were great but the real hero here is the space!  The entire place is lined with reclaimed barn wood and large exposed beams with contemporary lighting.  The bar has a concrete top and the ceilings are lined with cool accent tile.  I'll be back soon for a private party and look forward to enjoying the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"The Foundry was the destination for my two girl friends and I several weeks ago for my first night out post-pregnancy/delivery! Though I was really looking forward to getting out and giving myself a break, I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant. However, I was delightfully surprised.

The beer selection was good and unique. I had two different, delicious beers, one a saison and the other a strongly banana flavored hefeweizen (unfortunately, I cannot remember their names). Now to the food -- everything ranged from good all the way to incredible! I tried the Pimento cheese dip, grilled cheese, pomme frites, and mac and cheese. The clear winner was the grilled cheese, which my friends even deemed \"the best griled cheese they'd ever had.\" Yes, the beer may have been talking a little bit, but it was really, really good."}
{"text":"I always like trying new places. I never have off on a Saturday and finally did, so my boyfriend and I wanted to check out all of the new places in the North Shore, this being one of them. It was around 10 o'clock on Saturday when we walked in. There was not too many people there which is fine, we walked right to the bar to grab a beer. They have the beer listed on a chalk board to the left of the bar which is awesome so you can see what you want before even talking to a bartender. Once we both figured out what we wanted we ordered. The bartender did not seem to know what he was doing. My boyfriend ordered a Bell's Two Hearted which he poured. I ordered the 2x IPA from Southern Tier. He looked at me and said he had to go to the back to get it, but then kept staring at me. So I then proceed to tell him I will just have a Two Hearted as well. Without hesitation he poured me a Two Hearted. 
1. Do not have a beer list in the front if your bartenders do not want to get the beer for their customers, regardless of the location.
2. We had no idea about the FULL BACK BAR until the bartender in the front bar said so. 

Overall it was okay and laid back atmosphere, we will probably not be back. The front bar is totally unnecessary if you have a full back bar that is pretty much hidden. It was just a little weird. 
We did not try the food, however, just because of the service unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to post this because I don't want people to ruin this. I came here for lunch because we saw it was dog friendly. The pork belly app is a must.. we had 2. Our dogs had the best time. The cauliflower side... get it. Just don't think. You'll never regret spending $4 on it. I had the burger medium which literally melts in your mouth and my husband had chicken sandwich with the pickles. I don't know the official names of anything but just do as I'm saying. And get the fries. Just get the fries. If you let your dogs eat table food (yolo) let them eat the meat of the burger and the pork belly. Clay (our dog) was literally IN HEAVEN. We were too.

I think that's all. I had 2 don Carlos' and I too, am in heaven.

Update ***** Made me sad to update my review on this place. I went on March 19 with my family from Texas, took an eternity to get waited on, the waiter had no knowledge on the beer on taps, on top of the beers being severely picked over. A girl at a table a couple of tables next to us puked all over herself and even then, the wait staff didn't help clean, and her poor friends had to clean it up themselves. The food was still okay, but the portions of the appetizer and quality have definitely declined. My husband wanted to go back and give them another shot but it's hard to spend money on a place which has broken my heart! I feel like a bitter ex girlfriend."}
{"text":"Food, service, and prices are all good here. Both times I've been in, however, the front is empty--it's just a tough layout and no one knows what they're getting into until a hostess leads them to the back. Solution:  please convert this space to a coffee shop format similar to Starbucks with breakfast and lunch sandwiches made fast.  I work nearby on north shore drive, along with hundreds, if not a thousand other people who have no options for coffee and quick bites. All of the venues here, save for maybe burgatory, are geared toward the event crowd.  SAP just announced 242 new jobs coming to North Shore drive. Beat Starbucks to the punch and help us find a reasonably priced meal that doesn't require sit down service, crossing a river, or a delivery from jimmy johns.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best on the North Shore!  Forget about Hyde Park and Jerome Bettis' Grille 36.  Not only would this place be great before an event but it's great for any occasion. Went there for my birthday and the food is fabulous. The decor is open with plenty of tables nicely spaced.  There is outside seating also. But if you're a foodie, you will not be disappointed! My husband and I had the Duck-fried nuts appetizer and the tomato pierogies and  bbq pork Mac n cheese as small plates.  Exceptional flavor!  My husband loved the cod.  Don't scoff but I had the grilled cheese sandwich  -  it melted in my mouth!  The deconstructed Smores dessert is a chocolate lovers delight!  We definitely make this our North Shore favorite!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here before a killer show at Stage AE last night. We chose this place because we weren't really interested in any of the others that are in that immediate area.

Atmosphere: It was about 6:00 and we were worried there might be a wait, but to our surprise the place looked empty when we walked in. Not a single person in the small dining and bar area, aside from the hostess. It was a little off putting at first, I'm not going to lie. While I don't like to wait long for a table, I also don't want to eat at a ghost town. We got seated right away, though, and the hostess led us back a hallway to the main seating area. There were a handful of other parties in the back, which was nice to see. The aesthetic of the place is rustic/industrial, which I like, even if it is over done at this point. They did some cool stuff I haven't seen before with it too, so I enjoyed peeping at those details. Pretty good tunes playing over the speakers as well. Could have done without the TV's on the wall next to my table, but I get it. Being so close to the stadiums, I'm sure they get a decent crowd of fans in there on game days. They have a really nice outdoor patio that overlooks the river, but it was cold and rainy when we were there, so maybe next time.

Food: The menu is on the smaller side, but I'm okay with that because they had several options I would have eaten, and I've  The read in other reviews that they change their offerings somewhat frequently. I ended up getting the Pickle-brined Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries and their homemade ranch (I'm assuming it was homemade because it wasn't typical and was very tasty). The sandwich was a good size, and if I wasn't going to the show directly, I probably would have only eaten half at the time, but I gorged myself instead. The chicken thick and super crispy which I dug. I was expecting more of a pickle taste, but it really wasn't there. Though, I suppose I'd rather it be too little than too much when it comes to pickle chicken. The sandwich had actual pickle chips on it and I think that's really where all the pickle flavor came from, not the \"pickle-brined chicken\". The fries we also good. Just a little too salty for me, but dipping them in that wonderful ranch helped with that. My wife got the Grilled Cheese with Bacon. I had a bite and the cheeses they used had great flavor together. 

Drinks: Pretty good draft list. And they broke it all down by style, which is always super helpful to me. I got the Destihl Gose because why wouldn't I pair a sour beer with pickle chicken. Hind sight, it may have been a bit much, but since the pickle chicken wasn't all that pickly, it all worked out. They also had a large bottle selection, wine, and cocktails. 

Overall, we had a good experience, and I'd probably go back again. Pricing was reasonable (totaled $31.xx plus tip) and the food was good. Hoping to check out that patio on a nice summer's eve."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a Pirate game. Wasn't too crowded-don't know why. Best chicken sandwich I ever ate - awesome grilled cheese and Mac and cheese!  My son loved the pierogis, Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a 21+ event at the Carnegie Science Center. The bartender and general manager were so nice that we made reservations for the next day to be able to try the food! They were clearly really passionate about their jobs, and they made great drinks.

The general manager had spoken about the farm to table concept, and we were very excited to try it. We all ordered a bunch of different plates--we tried the pimento cheese dip, the spring veggie pho, the duck confit haluski egg noodles, the octopus appetizer, and I believe that we ordered the Foundry Burger, as well as the fried chicken sandwich. 

Overall, The Foundry was a hit with everyone. The atmosphere is great, and the space is large. The food was not bad--I think that it's a more bit more experimental than most new American restaurants, so some of the dishes can be hit or miss. For example, the pho wasn't my favorite--it tasted more like traditional Asian medicinal broth, but the duck confit haluski was hands down amazing, and I would go back just for that. Everybody else loved everything else they ordered, and the service was great. 

We will definitely be back for the duck confit noodles, and to also try some of the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, beer/drink selection are awesome. Really feels like a nice place. The food however is not. Ordered Mac and cheese and the foundry burger and it was terrible. The food was not hot and really had no flavor. We were in a large party and half the party got and ate their food before the other half. 
I would come back for a drink but not the food. Drinks are pricy too!"}
{"text":"Just really, really good.  The scallops and beef rib were both outstanding. I didn't try my son's burger, but the fries I snuck were deadly. 

Kudos to the bar: my wife's bourbon martini was a good concoction, and anyone who is willing to make a caipirinha, let alone a GOOD one, is all right in my book."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese with bacon was amazing. Best grilled cheese I have ever had. The fries were okay. The beer and drink list was large with many different options but a little pricer than I like to spend. My IPA was $8 and most of the mixed drinks were $10+."}
{"text":"A really cool building with a bar in the front and back and outdoor seating. I think the drafts were a little pricy. I had the grilled cheese with bacon. It was creamy and plenty cheesy. The bacon was decently thick slices crunchy but not so cooked that they shattered when you bit into the sandwich. The fries were perfectly seasoned. The foundry burger with a fried egg is a must. The beef blend was cooked perfectly to medium, juicy and flavorful. I would be interested in trying out their entrees and bar snacks too. A must stop if you're on the North Shore and want locally sourced food and not garbage from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Just got drinks but the food menu looked great, just opened, inside was awesome, the outside looked great on the river as well. Will for sure be going back to try food and more great craft brews!!!"}
{"text":"After a particularly long bike ride, this place hit the spot. Yes, yes, I was beyond hungry so maybe any food would have been received with total pleasure but I stand by my taste buds and stomach's total satisfaction.  I ordered a burger and fries and, seriously, this was in the top echelon of burgers -- cooked to perfection and moist.  And the fries were seasoned perfectly.

I will say I cannot believe they advertise the burger with American cheese as the only option.  That seems a bit sub-par (more than sup-bar, actually).  I was bold enough to ask for cheddar, thank goodness, so I'd ask you to do the same!

Oh, and I also had a bloody mary.  It was spicy enough to my liking.  The only sad-face part -- no celery available upon my request.  Sigh....

All in all, a nice restaurant/bar, especially if you want to watch a game on TV.  (The Steelers had just finished their game prior to our arrival which was good in a way -- the place was cleared out of patrons so no wait and our choice of tables!)"}
{"text":"Sat down and asked the bartender, several members of staff about greeting for food/drinks... nobody answered for several moments/rotations until went and escalated to management staff. Manager wasn't helpful, rude, impolite, non-promotional for business. Visiting from Cleveland and was not a pleasant experience. Hope things get better, has lots of potential just management issues just not what was expected for experience within the city.

{"text":"What a find! The North Side has really been amping up their bar/restaurant options and The Foundry is a great addition to the area. The space is huge with lots of table and bar seating. There's an industrial warehouse meets barn look going on and that pleases my Pinterest loving soul. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by my first experience here. 

I started off with a Mediterranean Mule ($10). This was made with some delicious fig vodka. The drink was fairly sweet, so it went down easy. Very yummy. 

For my meal I chose the Pickle Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich ($13). This was extremely tasty. Subtle pickle flavor and the challah bun rocked my world. I got a side of caramelized brussel sprouts (subbed them in instead of the standard fries) and they were perfect. 

My heart really wanted some Mac & Cheese, but they were OUT OF Mac & Cheese! Boo! Hiss! I only got through half of my sandwich so I guess the lack of Mac & Cheese wasn't the end of the world. 

Service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy, so I can forgive that."}
{"text":"Great spot to go after the Steelers game. Looks like there's a nice outdoor area for sitting by the river. Nice beer selection and yummy food. It was a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"This was a great spot that we happened upon for the evening. They have a wonderful happy hour and the service was great. Even though the menu didn't look too different from any other menu, the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Really nice open atmosphere and conveniently located right beside all of the baseball and football stadiums! I took a large group here for a work event and the restaurant very easily ensured a table for us large enough to accommodate our group even though it was also an evening of a local sports event. Really nice drink menu! Nice touch on American cuisine, will definitely venture back and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite newer restaurants in the city. I was looking for a place for my birthday to accommodate 20 people for a nice dinner without having to book a room. The manager, Andrew was very easy to work with and accommodating. We did get there before the Pirate game let out to avoid the crowds but the whole experience was great from the specialty drinks and all the food! I had the Pheasant over yukon gold potatoes and it did not disappoint-very tender and tasty. Our server was very attentive with all our drinks and different timing of food with some people coming late. She was also very patient separating checks and so forth. It gets a bit loud due to the acoustics when it's a full house but it's a definite place to visit."}
{"text":"My friend was in town for a conference and was staying down the street at the Hilton. I met her for a late dinner/drinks and we didn't know where to go. As we walked down the street a few of the places called to us but we have already hit them up before and wanted to try out something new, maybe something exciting. The Foundry was where we decided to go. It was pretty empty for the time of night so we got seated outside really fast. 

The first bad experience was something that maybe they had no control over but was irritating none the less. We sat outside and when I sat down there was a crack in the table and when the table moved all of the rain water that was just chilling there from the day or day before spilled all over my pants. Ok, not cool, but not terrible. Until it continued to happen every time the table was bumped. My own fault we should have moved but I honestly thought every time that it happened would be the last. 

I was hungry and asked the waitress what would be here suggestion. I was between items on the menu and needed her assistance. With her assistance I went with the Bahn Mi sandwich and a side of fries. 

ROAST PORK BÁNH MÌ: cucumber, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeno, baguette. This is where I went wrong. This sandwich was awful. There were little to no picked veggies,  little to no jalapenos, a ton of cilantro. The bread was WAY to thick and dry for the sandwich and it felt like it was taking all of the moisture out of my mouth. I ripped the bread in half and still felt like choking on it. I ended up just taking the meat off the bun and eating it with no bread. Ugh. The roast pork is not roasted pork as one would think it was pulled pork with a bbq like sweet sauce. Nothing like regular bahn mi's meat is usually made. It was just blah. The fries though were on point. They were garlicky and delish. I enjoyed them a lot. That sandwich though was the worst. Blah, that is a good word to describe it,

I do not know if I would come back just based upon that terrible sandwich. I mean, I always want to give places another shot but that and the fact that my pants were soaked by the end of the dinner just gave me this bad impression. 

I wish that I had a better time. The location and the views were beautiful, I just need a good reason to come here."}
{"text":"Had the burger and fries. Very very tasty. The reasoning behind the 4 stars is due to the pace of service. It was a weeknight and the dining area was barely a quarter full. I waited about 5-10 mins for each glass of wine. Very weird considering the table was 15 feet from the bar, there were 2 bartenders and also 2 servers all in my eyesight. Perhaps this restaurant excels when then are very busy. 

This had the farm to table ambiance, where the menu is changed frequently and it is also not to excessive, which I also feel gives the kitchen the ability to truly excel with the menu. Worth your time, I'd go back again if in town."}
{"text":"For the first time I've been here I would rate this establishment 5 stars. The food came out quickly, it was fresh and well prepared. The coffee was very good, the woman even put it in a to go cup for me! She also warmed it up and added a little more before I left. We were sharing plates and the food runner brought us more plates and was very pleasant. 

Tonight we walked in with a party of seven, the hostess basically said we cannot seat you tonight. That is all she said, we asked if we were allowed to go to the back bar and her reply was \"yeah, I guess\". I was just disappointed, I thought she would have presented us with options as like splitting up our party and so forth. But she did not. We went to the back back and it was totally empty, which was great! We all sat down and the man bartending was super nice, friendly, had great recommendations and never left us with an empty drink. He even split the checks for us and didn't blink an eye when we asked. Tonight the food did not come out as perfect as the first time, I understand it was wayyyy busier than the first time but it was still good. The one girl who joined us for dinner said it was the best grilled cheese she ever had. I had pumpkin pierogies, and the market salad. My fiancé had the pulled pork, he loved it as well!  I was surprised a 16 oz blue moon was $7.00, quite honestly the most I've ever seen blue moon be charged. 

I understand we were in a high traffic area and they were busy, but the servers were running in front of guests and basically pushing them aside. I found that quite rude. 

Definitely worth a try and I will look forward to coming back to give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We visited the Foundry for brunch and loved it! 

Our table shared a few brunch appetizers, including the pork belly bites, duck confit haluski, and the scotch egg. Everything was so delicious, I would have been happy to keep sampling appetizers. Entree orders varied around the table, with a little bit of everything. I personally had the huevos rancheros, which was among the best I've had since living in the southwest. Our son had chicken fingers and fries but there were a few other options for kids as well - so this is a great brunch option for the whole family. 

A few of us did the bloody mary bar, which featured, among other additions, giant perfect slabs of pepper bacon. The other drink options are widely varied, providing something for everyone.

The decor is very clean and contemporary; and, the service was excellent. Add in the location on the North Shore, with plenty of good views and walking paths, and The Foundry is an ideal location for brunch. 

We absolutely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"The beer and liquor list is extensive and up to date with current t trends.  We are here before a game and wanted to try a variety of appetizers.  The pork belly was the hit.  It has a nice spicy balance to the greasy pork with the jalapeños.  Next was the pimento cheese dip.  I expected it to be warm but it was not.  It was good but not amazing.  The pickled onions on the side did kick it up a notch but not enough to order again.  Last was the clams.  These were under whelming and had an overpowering pork taste.  It was so strong you could not taste anything else.  We also tried the deserts.  We had the ricotta cheese cake and the chocolate tart.  Both fell flat and lacked flavor and did not deliver on  the sweet that o crave after a meal.  The service was fine as to be expected.  A plus was the space.  This is a large place with nice outside seating."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great beer selection and super friendly server, Shayna. Loved the Korean BBQ wings and the grilled cheese. Definitely interested in trying some of the other items on the menu. I really like that you have the option to sit outside. I would imagine this is a fun place for some day drinking!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave reviews but I decided to this time.

A.  It is very overpriced for what you get.

I ordered the soup and a slice of hazelnut torte.  Total was close to 30 dollars.  I had high hopes they would be good.

B.  It isn't good.

The crust on the torte was relatively flavorless and bland and much too thick.  I was sad about this.  The filling and the drizzle was fairly bitter and very coffee tasting.  But a bitter kind of coffee.  The crunchy bits were tasty.  The hazelnut brittle tasted a little too burnt.  I was sad.

The soup...... well...   small.  Very, very, very small.  Hardly any noodle at all.  Like perhaps two spoons worth.  Just a lot of greens.  Too much greens.  Like way too much cilantro and parsley and leaves.  I like greens but this was like greens overkill and tasted much like I was eating leaves from a tree in a beef broth.  I was totally disappointed and I do not think I will give this place another go."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot on North Shore. Completely redone interior with lots of reclaimed barn wood, two bars (one with a copper top, one with a concrete too), awesome outdoor patio space, sweet mural of PGH skyline. 

And don't miss the food and drinks. Burger, pulled pork, handmade roasted tomato pierogies, pork Mac n Chz, hanger steak, crispy pork belly bites, etc. ..... Great draft list. Lots of local beers. I could go on and on. Just go already!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice space to hit before or after a game downtown. We stopped in before a Pitt game. The space is pretty nice. We noticed that while it seemed pretty rustic (think Industry Public House if you've ever been) but it doesn't all flow together. Their benches kind of look like they got them from an old Ponderosa- but they are paired with nice wooden tables and chairs. Weird.

Service was nice. We were actually greeted at the door when we arrived with a \"thanks for coming in\" and the same when we left. Very pleasant. Quick, attentive. Would have been nice if we were in a hurry.

The food, to me, was just ... meh. I got really excited about the pumpkin pierogies- and they were simply not good. Grilled cheese was better, but it seems like they tried too hard to make it look special and it was just okay. Beer selections are good. If I came back in, I'd get munchies and a beer, dinner somewhere else. It's new. I'll give it a try again sometime once the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for brunch on a early Sunday afternoon so that we could eat, drink, and watch the Steelers game.  I wanted to try out this place mostly because it looked like a really nice atmosphere to watch some football!

     On our brunch dates we usually have no idea if the place is going to be packed or not.  So we made reservations here the day before just to make sure.  Well we didn't need to make them because there was barely anybody here at first.  

     We walked in and were greeted by the hostess.  There was a small bar to the right of us but I knew that there was more to this restaurant.  I told the hostess that this was the first time that we were here so she directed us to go back to their main bar and dinning area.  After getting through the long hallway we got to the bar and it was a nice layout.  They have a big bar with TV's everywhere, spacious, and very new looking.

     We were really hungry so we started looking at the menu. My wife got their Bloody Mary bar to start out.  I started with a beermosa.  We ordered their roasted pumpkin pierogis to start.  They were really good and a good start to our brunch.  

     I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for brunch but I ended up ordering their Pickle-Brined Fried Chicken.  I usually don't order a fried chicken sandwich like this but I was in the mood for it.  I thought it was ok.  It kind of reminded me of a Chick Fila Sandwich but at a restaurant.  It was ok but I kind of wished I ordered something else.  

     During the game we switched over to drinking beer for the rest of the Steeler game.  Overall the brunch food was ok and the Pumpkin Pierogis were really good.  Our bartender was great and we did enjoy watching the football game here.  I think we would come back to watch a sporting event here and try out their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"The kale ceaser salad is amazing. I got mine with grilled chicken. The dressing is perfect and they have they fried asiago Chicopee things in place of croutons that are so good. 
I also enjoyed the oysters. Would recommend  checking this place out. 
Excellent service, enjoyed the music, and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Hey shitheads, wanna update your hours on yelp so that people don't come in for nothing?"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot...a few kinks with the service during the first week, but food and cocktails have been on point. I've been a few more times, and everything has come together nicely. Definitely recommend. I love the duck-fried nuts and the seared scallops. The wings were tasty too. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Great locally sourced spot to feel right in the middle of things in Pittsburgh with outdoor seating and an awesome bar with a menu that has something for everyone and great selection of beers! 

Food: This place has things on their menu varying from peirogis and haluski and pho and ban mi. All of which you can taste how fresh and they source locally! My husband got the ban mi and although there was a ton of pork in it, it was shredded not sliced. My grilled cheese was simple but delicious and not overly filling. The sides of garlic fries were delicious and their side salads include kale and edible flowers making me want to order a whole salad next time! 

Drinks: We sat outside, but I want to come back for happy hour just to see at their awesome bar. Their happy hour is 1/2 drafts and is truthfully the only time I would come back considering the beers are pretty steep for Pittsburgh.

Atmosphere: Huge place right on North Shore with a large rustic inside with the a huge wrap around bar with plenty of TVs to watch games. There is ample outdoor seating right on the river walk for a good view and central location!

Value: They have daily specials (find on their website) and a good happy hour. But normally beers run around $8 with average food prices."}
{"text":"Figured I would try out this new restaurant on the North Shore. We got the olives for appetizer which consisted of just a bowl of olives (no bread or anything to go with it). I got the steak frites which was just a small 6-8oz steak with french fries (no other sides). I was really disappointed with the amount of food I got for a $24 dish. The steak was okay at best. A little overcooked but the biggest turn off was the overpowering liquid smoke flavoring that was added to the steak. 

It seemed like the restaurant was very understaffed with the waitress being forced to make our drinks instead of the bartender. All in all it took about 45 minutes for them to make our food. We did get a dessert for our troubles which was the banana bread dish. The dessert was pretty good but once again, to charge $7 for three small pieces of banana, a few pieces of bread, and dressing is a bit excessive.

Probably won't be coming back unless I'm in the area for a concert or sporting event but in that case I'll probably stick to drinks."}
{"text":"Hi, My husband and I went to The Foundry this past Friday. We were greeted after seated by the most beautiful girl. Her name was Lisa. First she started telling us that it was her first weekend night that she was working. She made it a point to tell us if there was anything wrong to tell her immediately. We appreciated that since so many places that we use to frequent have gone down hill in the service category. Now the food. My husband and I both got the same thing. The Foundry Burger with the works. We both added bacon. He ordered his mooing and I ordered mine medium. All and all it was a pleasurable night out. We will definitely be back and certainly recommend to all of our friends."}
{"text":"This is their $12 beet salad. Barely a side salad. Would've been nice to know before we ordered two to go and got home to this. We actually laughed when we opened the boxes thinking they messed up our order. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is maybe a cup. We called them and they offered a refund on one of the salads. Hilarious."}
{"text":"So... Positives - place looks great, food is pretty good, drink list is pretty good... Overall a nice spot. HOWEVER, I'm here for the Pitt vs Penn St game and this place is HORRIBLY mismanaged. There is one poor bartender at a bar of about 300 customers. The crowd is way, way past Fire Marshall capacity! Like 'if something happens people will die' past capacity. It's ridiculous. We got here early enough to get a table and ordered food and drinks. The waitress said she couldn't get our second round because of the crowd, and doesn't see that changing anytime soon. It's been 30 mins... It's unfortunate to say, but places run this poorly never stay in business. Idk who spent all the money to open this place just to throw it away with mismanagement, but they did. Epic fail! Terrible."}
