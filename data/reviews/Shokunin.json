{"text":"I decided to try this new restaurant out last week as it had a lot of good reviews. The food and service were excellent. The ramen was very good. My only regret was that I came too lunch and the yakitori was not available yet (after 3:00 pm, I think). I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nothing like it in Calgary.   The decor gives it a tokyo vibe that adds to the ambiance. The food and drinks were spectacular and the service was great.   Once you grasp the concept of small plates you'll notice the quality of ingredients and the thought process put into the food.  Great job Darren! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"It's pretty amazing and worth the price for the Chicken Karaage alone. Great service and cool vibes all around, Prefer the ever changing dinner menu versus going for lunch. Always the first place on my mind when I have guests from out of town visiting."}
{"text":"I almost gave you guys 1 star, but I went for 2 because I don't want you to think I'm tearing you down.   I read the reviews on this place, but I honestly don't ever want to be that person that lets the bad reviews stop me from coming in -- so I went anyway. I will say that I was totally looking forward to coming to this place...so much that I wanted it to be my first meal when I landed in Calgary. My girlfriend and I were pretty excited to try the food here, especially after looking over the menu online...but it was no good.  It's been a month since our experience there, and I was hoping that somehow my recollection of Shokunin would be different, but it's not. I am not a food snob at all, but damn -- no flavor or presentation even. I mean, have all you guys that work there tasted the food? Is it one person in charge of the taste, or is it a collective effort? Either way, all you guys are lying to each other because your food has no taste. Are all you guys homies? I don't know. Like, if I was about to open a restaurant, and all my homies let me open this spot where all the food tasted below \"Shokunin\" standards, I would question the depth of my friendships. I promise you that if food has even a little something about it, I will say what it is...but I just can't with this place. lol I still feel so disappointed in Shokunin :( I really, REALLY wanted to like you guys, but I cannot help to think that people are writing good reviews about you guys because they don't want to feel salty at how much money they spent on what I am sure was an underwhelming experience. Or maybe this was their first time experiencing this flavor and they have nothing else to compare it to. I honestly don't know.   Looking back at it, we pretty much just paid for their awesome sound system and vibey ambience. I will say that the music selection was on hit though. Oh, and the eggplant dish had nice cuts, but that's it.   To say that we will never be back might be a little hasty, but we will not be back any time soon. We'll come back when your kitchen has honestly re-evaluated your menu and when ya'll stop lying to each other.   Lastly, if you're going to be selling premium quality sake, you better be damn sure you're selling premium quality food.    Truly hoping you change for the better,  AM"}
{"text":"Ok this place is catching it's stride! I would say right now typing this is sour grapes. If you come check out lunch I might have to wait, if not maybe they decide lunch crowd to small. So let me tell you it is well worth the trip cross the river from all the other good ramen places. To find a no line up authentic bowl of hand made noodles! That is like finding yourself a freaking Unicorn. Not that I want a line but I sure as hell do not want the best chicken style ramen to become late night only. Some #noodleheads one and all come your slurp on"}
{"text":"For being the only resturant with this kind of food and atmosphere combined with our great experience how could I give any less than 5 stars!?!?  Since we were not sure about the menu we decided on the chefs menu. We got great seats right at the chefs bar where we could watch all the action and have great conversations with the chef. The food came out at a great pace where we could enjoy it but still have really good conversation between foods. Everything that we tried was amazing. Great flavours in the drinks and food and we discovered that not all Sake tastes like gasoline and we actually liked it.  Overall a great experience and we will be back to try more of their options.  I suggest going on a less busy day either during the week or on a Sunday night to really have a chance to chat with the chef and get the whole experience."}
{"text":"I was excited about a new Japanese place in town but left disappointed. Upon seeing the menu I was skeptical of the price to quality. We wanted shishito peppers but they were out. We wanted draft beer but they were out....annoyed I just ordered Kirin and one appetizer.   I tried the braised daikon raddish ($10) just to test the waters and was utterly disappointed. The dashi broth was good but the pork tasted like fried ground pork breakfast sausage. There were two tiny pieces of daikon in broth. For $10!?!? The other menu items seem grossly overpriced and Im glad I left after one dish.   The waitress was wearing horribly strong perfume and I could smell her the entire meal. You should keep the perfume situation under control as no one wants to smell sweet teenager perfume while trying to eat. Perfume aroma affects taste of food.  By the way, if you write a negative review about this restaurant, expect a message from the chef/owner being defensive about his overpriced low quality \"Japanese food.\""}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews but had to mention the great experience that I had at Shokunin on April 7th. We went there for dinner with a few friends and had an amazing knowledgeable waiter who was able to make some great recommendations. Our favorites were the Scallop, the Sashimi bowl and the chef's special sashimi lobster. We ordered a few cocktails which were not great, but as the chef/owner overheard us he was most kind to get them remade as per how they were intended (plus a few extra) and they were fantastic (notably their black tea old fashioned with Nikka whiskey) and also brought us a delicious sake for the table. The entire experience was fantastic and I highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a fun night out with friends or an intimate date."}
{"text":"We went here to eat ramen. But they only serve it 10pm-1am. So we tried their dinner menu instead. But omg! The foods are soooo yummy!  especially that gyoza and chicken karage!  the chef is also so nice to give us free potato sweet thingy. Will surely go back here to taste their ramen.  i think i found my favorite resto here in yyc"}
{"text":"Food was great. We waited a long time for food (we were one of two tables) and the wait was approx. 40mins. And the order was wrong. Their customer service was great.  They apologized profusely."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive for the price you pay. Their signiture dishes were bad. Got four sips of tea in a cup for $7. Better off spending that money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Used Calgary's Big Taste festival as an excuse to try out this restaurant as I had heard great things. On Saturday night the place was lively and busy but still very comfortable. The menu offers a wide selection of dishes; a great change from other Japanese restaurants in town that focus primarily on sushi or ramen. Each of our six courses was absolutely delicious and was introduced with enthusiasm by their attentive wait staff. The carefully selected ingredients are top quality - the homemade wasabi was a clear cut above what I'm used to, and the broths and sauces were all amazing. The chef even treated us to a taste of their amazing Wagyu beef; a special offering brought in from Japan only once a month, if you happen to be there when they are serving it don't miss it. The manager Colin and his staff were welcoming, professional, and friendly. The meal was outstanding and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Cool dining concept but missed the mark sorely on delivery and service.  We ate here as a group of four. The food overall was OK, but the lacklustre experience really hindered our enjoyment of it all.  First of all, we requested waters all around in addition to the beverages that were ordered. The beverages and *some* water came, so we again requested waters all around. We requested this at least 3 times, via different servers who stopped by even, and only got the additional waters towards the end of our meal. One of the servers bringing out food dropped off a plate of \"chicken ass skewers\" that we DIDNT order and when we protested, he had to take a closer look and try to \"guess\" as to what it might be. Umm, if you work here, I sure as heck HOPE you know whether you are serving me EXACTLY what I ordered. The server went back to the kitchen, and came back with the same plate and declared them chicken thighs and dropped them off. We had also ordered some appetizers and skewers that simply never came. Upon checking with our server, they finally did come out and the appetizer was on the house.  Overall, as I said, as interesting dining concept - not unlike tapas, but the quality of service could really be improved. It wasn't even crazy busy when we went -  so it was overall somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place. Service was excellent. Fried chicken thighs and duck tataki were amazing. Ramen was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chef Darren is doing an amazing job at Shokunin... I have always been a huge fan of his food but this is next level stuff everyone. I was there again last night and had the most amazing Ramen of my life... The menu is creative and all the dishes I have had are delicious and beautifully presented. The space is super high energy with amazing service from caring and authentic people. So happy this is in our city!"}
{"text":"The mushroom skewers and the bbq chicken hearts were amazing. Also very good cocktails."}
{"text":"I tried Shokunin for the first time last night and absolutely loved it. The Omakase was diverse and thoughtful with an outstanding sake paring. A restaurant like this, one that pushes peoples' culinary comfort zones while churning out stellar food amidst a super cool vibe, is long overdue in this city. In summary, go to Shokunin, order one of the dangerously tasty and strong cocktails, bob your head to your favorite 90's hip hop jams, eat your heart out (including the literal chicken heart) and have a memorable dinner out that is both decadent and yet incredibly approachable."}
{"text":"Yakitori was pretty good but everything was a bit too salty. Way over prized and for how little you get. If you want to spend lots of money but not get full, this is the place for you.  We left hungry but spent $90+.  Very sad  The extra star was just for the good service cause out server was very genuine"}
{"text":"Every dish we had here was very good, especially their chicken. The waiter highly recommended the calamari, which was good but nothing special, I would try their other dishes over the calamari. The chicken wings were spectacular, and the chef sent over some complimentary ones because the ones we got weren't up to his standards (they looked and tasted good to us). Definitely will go back to try their other dishes and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner yesterday and my first impression of this place was good. Nice and cozy looking with a tokyo feel too it. When we first came in it didn't seem like they were sure we had a reservation but the place was quite empty anyways. The waitress seemed very nice, good service but I think may need a little more info on some of the menu items.  Also she made a statement that they had the largest selection of sake in north america. I am an avid fan of sake and I highly doubt the statement is true as I have been to other establishment with a lot more selection. Although I would say they may have a few other unique ones I have not see in this city. Overall the food was very good with the exception of a few dry yakitori's and dessert was not my cup of tea. Sounded good but did not taste very appealing.  Overall service was excellent as the food came out fast.  Price point of this place is a bit expensive if your looking to get your tummy filled. If your here for casual drinks I would recommend sticking with beer or cocktails.  The sake is worth it if your willing to dish out some cash for a bigger bottle.  Even an upper scale japanese restaurant serving sake by the glass would be around 3 to 5 ounces for around the $10 - $15 but we had a chinese teacup bit over 3/4 full for $10 dollar is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Our first time there was lovely, everything was good. Not great but good. Second time was an abomination! Rude service, obnoxious managment and terrible food. Although they were out of a good portion of the menu we wanted to order one the first occasion, there was nothing to complainabout. The second visit was not the same.   I do not like complaining, but when you are paying good money for food and it is inedible it is much better to give the restaurant a second chance to pick up their game rather than hold a negative impression of the place. Our skewers were beyond charred and when we were brought new ones they were equally as terrible. It was the attitude of the front of house and dealing with the problem that merits a poor review. The skewers on our first visit were quite nicely cooked, but burnt the second time. I felt uncomfortable to be told that, that is how they are supposed to be when I have had them at shokunin before and been to some great yakitori spots in japan.  I have had many things happen at many restautants; an entire tray of drinks spilled on me, late for meetings beacuse of errors or delays, mix ups with order taking, poor quality etc. Never have i felt so put down for mentioning my opinion to a server, i thought the customers is always right (even when they are wrong). Not at shokunin. Often a mistake can be turned into a positive, not the case on this occasion. I will give it one more chance since i love ramen and have not yet been there when it is available  .  Drinks are expensive but good  ."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out with the hype, went there couple weeks after it was opened. was very disappointed, even though i really wanted to like it. I have been to izakayas in Japan and all over north america..this place takes what was meant to be bar snacks you have with drinks, reduced it by 1/3rd of the average portion and charged premium prices. I do not mind paying high prices for quality..it just fell really short for me.Food was mediocre. nothing was memorable.   14 dollars for 3 pieces of gyoza ..another table had 4 pieces. maybe someone failed count that night. I realize Oxtail isn't cheap and takes time to break it down to make it tender.. but 5 dollar per gyoza?! 12 dollars for couple pieces of daikon.. which is literally a root vegetable (potatoes).   Felt like the chef went to Japan on a spur of a moment day trip and came back claiming to know 'japanese' cuisine and along came with it ;  extremely big ego to be pricing dishes like that.   Other than that, drinks and ambiance were good. Would come here for drinks..., after having dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wandering around Mission, a girlfriend suggested we stop in at Shokunin for drinks as the patio was beckoning us.   For drinks, the shiso colada intrigued me the most - a refreshing coconut milk infused drink on a hot summer day? Yes please! It *almost* made me feel like I was on a beach vacay lol  Quickly glancing over the menu and now reading all the reviews, I'll definitely have to head back to try all the delish food they have!"}
{"text":"The service is great and so is the atmosphere. The dishes are reasonably priced for the yakitori style and allows you to try so much more! Also the kale salad is delicious."}
{"text":"Hard to top my dinner companion's review - I think he said it all.   Absolutely memorable evening for the tastebuds! At the suggestion of Brodie we ordered the omakase and were treated to potato salad, chicken skins, sashimi (and I would have enjoyed three more servings of this!), flank steak, veggies, rice, skewers of chicken yakitori. Sublime cocktails and the good humour of Brodie and his colleague kept the evening light. Every employee we met helped make our soiree memorable - can't wait to return as we look forward to trying the ramen!"}
{"text":"In summary: a busy place with very loud music but loosing some hearing is a small price to pay to get at their offerings! Not everyone will think binchotan is \"special\" but Shokunin's flavours are bold and amazing! Some of their reworked classics *cough* Octopus Fritters *cough* are the best I've ever had; in Calgary and Japan! It might cost a bit more (especially if you like cocktails with dinner) but it's worth saving up for!  In detail: I've been here twice now and I've loved it both times! The food is the main draw for me but the service is also fantastic! Loved the hot towel they give you right away! Nice authentic touch, but also just a nice touch in general.  Best of what I've sampled so far: #1 Octopus Fritters: if you've had takoyaki before and liked it, then you have to try this! It blows ALL other takoyaki out of the water! Also if you're hungry get this, you'll leave full on deliciousness and love for the world!!   #2 Skewers (especially chicken heart!) Wanna save some cash? Order the skewers! Avoid the common stuff like chicken breast, thigh and the veg. Go for the lesser knowns like liver, heart or skin. $2 each, get 10 that's $20, not bad for dinner!  #3 try the Okami Kasu: their specialty beer, a collaboration with Big Rock Brewery. Made with rice, no other beer tastes like this! Not everyone will like it but it's worth trying.  Note: watch yourself with that brew! Okami Kasu is 8% (16oz) and it really doesn't seem like it going down!  Honourable mentions: Braised Daikon: umami and salty goodness. Another perfectly perfected classic! Eggplant: that sauce will make your day! Such luscious sesame goodness! Duck Tataki: I really don't like ginger but the ponzu-y vinegary sauce made the grated ginger palatable, even delicious! Anything that makes ginger delicious for me has my approval and reverence!  Cons:  Sometimes the music is way too loud, like shout at the person right beside you level! You're not running a club here people!  It's unfortunate that not everyone can sit at the counter, those are the best seats! However since this place is likely to be busy often, that's a matter of luck, party size and connections!  Lastly, not sure if they've made it onto open table or not but they were using bookenda for reservations before and I'm not really a fan of having to get another app just for them (even though I did.)  TL,DR: Go to Shokunin, order Octopus fritters, skewers: Chicken Heart, Skin and the feature, drink the Okami Kasu beer. If you like cocktails or whisky with dinner don't except a cheap night! Leave full of goodness and love!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and had a great experience both times. Last time, my wife and I sat at the \"chefs bar\" and chatted with Darren most of the night, was a great experience and really cool to gain some insight to a very fast moving little kitchen with a focus on quality and consistency. Saw more than a few dishes not make the pass as Darren inspected every dish before handing over to ensure it was absolutely perfect. Food was ridiculous good, drinks also very good although I would maybe like to see one more rotating local tap. Prices are not cheap, but quality is top notch and I certainly left feeling that I got all of my moneys worth.    For god sake folks please don't ask for soy sauce with the sushi, its all pre-dressed, this isn't Kinjo.   Will definitely go back (can't wait)."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable if not exceptional experience with Darren. Great atmosphere, amazing Sake selection. A must visit whilst in Calgary."}
{"text":"The place has a unique decoration (anime, drawings, figures) mix with modern design. The quality and speed of service and food was the right amount.   Although the food we ordered like the chicken karaage was too salty for me (as is), use lemon and/or mayo sauce to mask it. Both Miso & Tonkatsu ramen was just average and pricey; the portion size was big, but the broth for the Miso is too oily while the Tonkatsu broth had a mild taste. The noodles & the egg are great in texture and taste. The pork doesn't melt in my mouth and had to remove excess fat, but offered a decent portion size.  I believe this restaurant really does well with Izakaya, deserts, and cocktail items as the name suggest. Overall, for me, it is pricey (you get your worth for the quality ingredients), heavy (Ramen) and too salty (Chicken Karaage)."}
{"text":"I only tried Shokunin once, so I think it's due for another go. When I did check it out it was during lunch with some colleagues.  We were all not very hungry so we decided just to share a few things. The chicken skewers were pretty good but some pieces were all fat... I know men seem to like this but me.. not so much.   it's cute inside and out server was fast and helpful. I heard their ramen is amazing so maybe i'll have to try that sometime, too."}
{"text":"The old school hiphop music lured me into this restaurant.   All I can say is that the food, ambiance and service were superb.  Will surely comeback for their late night ramen."}
{"text":"I have to come to shokunin at least a few times a year for their amazing service and tasteful food. Their menu change by the season so I make sure to visit every time they have a new menu and it has never disappointed me. Some staples they have at the restaurant such as the skewers and the scallop is there all year round. The head chef Darren really cares about the quality of each item that comes out of his kitchen. If you ever get the chance, you should sit at the bar facing the kitchen so you can watch Darren and his kitchen team cook your food right in front of you for the full experience."}
{"text":"Total let down. I had such high hope for this place before coming here. When I got there, I didn't know what to order from their 2 pages menu. Food is way too overpriced for the quality and quantity you get. $12 for chicken karage aka in their version was just overpriced boneless chicken wings. $16 fong style sashimi was 7 pieces paper thin sashimi that taste nothing special. There was nothing exceptional about the taste of the food. Way too overpriced for what you get. I have had better Japanese food elsewhere with fraction of what it would cost me to get full here. Go somewhere else if you don't want to waste your money."}
{"text":"This place is terrible the food is low quality and the service sucks. The waitress have poor manners and do not seem to care. I am a business owner and I know if my employees showed lack of care towards my business or customers they would be fired.   This place will not last in Calgary at this rate."}
{"text":"Everything that we ate here was very good! Chicken thighs, ass and neck, hamachi maki, squid tempura, beef tongue gyoza and plum sake. Service was great! They play R&B and hip hop which was unexpected. Very cool spot!"}
{"text":"Shokunin, wow.  Darren the owner, wow.  This place made my Calgary visit even in the -20 degree weather.  I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Shokunin makes a delicious late night ramen, bright and flavourful sashimi dishes with ethically sources seafood and crave worthy meats grilled over binchotan charcoal. The soundtrack is on point and room has a fun vibe to it"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must for your visit to Calgary! The Chef cares so much about his restaurant that he's curated an amazing menu and can also be seen clearing tables and checking in on his customers. The food is a fun exploration of flavours, textures and of course amazing smells. For the curious foodie like me looking for something new and interesting; this is by far my favourite restaurant in Calgary!"}
{"text":"On a whim, I ended up at Shokunin with a date.  We ordered the Omakase (... a bewildering cavalcade of mystery foods...), most of which was totally outside my sphere of experience. I unexpectedly quite enjoyed a few dishes (e.g. Heart Yakitori); others I'll pass on when I next visit (e.g. Chicken Skin Chips)... likes and dislikes were really a matter of personal taste \"so don't take my word for it\".  Try each and every dish on that menu yourself.  This place is definitely worthy of further exploration.  I never heard from my date again.  Pretty sure it had nothing to do with the food ... (sad trombone sound)..."}
{"text":"New resto in Calgary, open one month when we came in. They were pretty organized and on the ball for only being open one month, impressive! The inside is nice, more modern bar like. We sat at the bar over looking the kitchen and had the most amazing experience!! He chef often came over, explained the food and sake to us and even gave us a few extra tasters, bonus!  We had the Octopus fritters and Yakitori! Our faves: chicken knee (perfect amount of meat, fat and crunch), chicken ass (so crispy and delicious!!!!), beef tongue (not on the menu but served front he chef, soooooo tasty), and chicken thighs. Must get the Egg Yolk Soy dip!  Then we had the late night Miso ramen topped with Sous Vide Char Sui, along with a soft boiled egg. Noodles were chewy, and broth was rich in flavour and perfectly fatty.  If you like Sake, you'll love this place! The chef chose them all himself in Japan.  Will definitely be back! I must try the Unagi style fish."}
{"text":"You can tell that they put a lot of thought and creativity into their food. They have a lot of unique food on the menu. My party of 8 came here and tried out about 20 dishes. We definitely ate more than we should have. Our server was great as well as the ambiance. Everyone at the table loved the food. I loved their sashimi, and choice of fish they offered. However, I felt that the flavour in the cooked food's we ordered was 2 dimensional, for the majority of dishes we tried. I've been here two times, and both times I've been very disappointed in their ramen, our second time the ramen was so salty (coming from someone whose tried a lot of ramen across Calgary and Toronto). I think this place is a fusion restaurant and not authentic Japanese, which is most likely why I'am not a fan."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a spot that does excellent yakitori, serves quality sake and opens late for when a steaming bowl of ramen would hit the spot.  Shokunin is a welcome addition to the Calgary food scene. Led by Darren Maclean, formerly of downtownfood, the scene is pretty inviting with an open kitchen and bar up front to watch the techniques used in cooking up your food.  Highlights on a soft opening night included octopus fritters, succulent chicken thigh and heart skewers and a \"unagi\" style pickerel don which was a surprisingly delicious adaptation in support of the sustainable approach to the menu.  Looking forward to slurping on the ramen in the future. Will be coming back many times for drinks and skewers of meat."}
{"text":"Awesome yakitori! Chicken thigh and breast, spicy pork are my recommendations. The beef gyoza and sweet corn and shrimp dumplings are also very tasty. The sashimi options have been very fresh as well.  This place is great and music is on point. Always delicious and service has been perfect every time I have been. Quickly has become one of my favourite places in the city."}
{"text":"The first few times I went , around the time Shokunin opened, I was impressed by their yakitori and selection of Japanese whiskey. It was my go to place if I have some extra money to spend on a nice experience. However, the last few times, it's been pretty bad. The noodles in the ramen aren't very good, and the broth is bland (especially for the high price). In fact, a few weeks ago, there was a clump of undercooked noodles in my ramen.   After that, I vowed to never eat their ramen anymore, but I decided to give it one last shot a few nights ago. I called beforehand to make sure they were still serving ramen and hadn't run out, and to ask what kind of ramen they had that night (during the summer they sometimes had different styles). My question was met with a rude \"We only do one kind. Shio.\" Ooookay, sorry for being obviously stupid, buddy. I went there, and the music was way super loud, like club level loud. There was a group of drunk girls literally screaming and laughing at the top of their lungs. They were having a good time, which is great--Nothing against that! I want people to have a great time. But my issue is that Shokunin seems to be ok with having that image of a loud, crazy club-style restaurant/bar??? Whereas before it seemed like they were going for a higher end, chill, lounge vibe, which is what attracted me to them. Oh, and this time, the egg in my ramen was still frozen. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon :("}
{"text":"Had to get a proper Izakaya spot in during my trip to Calgary so it was very important to pick the right one and I'm glad I picked the right place! It's small and cozy and the decor had a nice Japanese fusion twist to it. The owner is very welcoming and sat us to our seats while offering his opinions on what he recommends which is nice to see. I started off with a Park Hyatt in the Mist while my girlfriend ordered a Kiiro. As we wanted to try a little bit of everything, we had some nigiri (sawara and hira aji), chicken skin chips, scallop isoyaki, saba kama and some yakitori (shiitake, beef tongue, chicken ass and chicken oyster). You can't go wrong with any of the stuff we ordered as they were all great. I can see why this place was voted top 50 places in Canada and I would definitely come back! Hopefully we will see chef in Vancouver for one of his collaborations in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Reputation is well deserved. I would happily spend the rest of my life living off chicken skin chips. Also, the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"My review is long overdue. We had a friend B-Day dinner here which mean we were a large party... approx 12 people. Here's what happened that night:  1. Evening started off good... we ordered tons of appetizers to share... I believe every skewer they had. We eventually lost track of what was being brought out.. as well as the waitress. At one point she served us a meat that wasn't correctly named. We only discovered this minor error when another waitress brought out the correct one much later. No big deal.   2. A few of us ordered the ramen (the one with the burnt garlic) I can only describe the broth as extremely burnt and bitter... I'm no ramen expert so I didn't say anything. It was my friend, who is like a ramen connoisseur, that commented that the broth was bitter burnt. When we brought it to the waitress' attention, she explained it's supposed to taste burnt. Refused to acknowledge our complaint. The other members of our party ordered a different ramen soup and did not get the burnt bitter taste. We suspect the chef threw in end-of-the-day burnt garlic unknowingly... but still.. it left a bitter taste in our mouths for the rest of the evening.  3. Our egg/rice ball came extremely late... around the same time as when the bill came (3 hours into our meal). We essentially told the waitress to put it into takeout boxes. What a waste as these are not good the next day.  4. Bill time... we knew the bill was going to be astronomical... which it was. We always double check the bill when we have large parties. One surprise was the extra charge for the sauces that came out with the meat dishes. We never asked for them. The waitress assumed we wanted extra sauce... thanks but no thanks.   5. Last pain point that evening... the majority of our party paid by credit card, with most being couples so it wasn't like the waitress had to keep track of 12 different receipts the machine spit out. Some of us opted out of having a copy of the receipt.... what a mistake. She lost one of the receipts and held us there while she called the debit machine company. Only during this time did the manager come out to talk to us. We told her how our evening went... to which she responded with an apology. Since we had already paid, she said she couldn't do anything for us. Uhhh... we also paid cash. Again thanks for the wonderful hospitality *sarcasm*  Conclusion: I understand that large groups are hard to accommodate while maintaining a certain level of service. The food was mostly excellent (ramen excluded). Overall, I would not recommend this place to large groups as they seem to struggle with big parties."}
{"text":"What can I say? Shokunin has to be one of my favorite dining experiences since I moved to Calgary a few months ago. The atmosphere there was definitely bumpin with throwback hip-hop and R&B blasting all night. My kinda spot to chill, snack and drink with sone good friends.   The food was absolutely top-notch!   To start, my friends and I ordered the chicken skin chips (delectably crispy!), grilled beef tongue (chewy and flavourful)and chicken ass (also crispy good). Great food to go with a bottle (or two... or three) of Kirin or Sapporo. We also got the scallop isoyaki, which is served on a mini-grill cooking right at your table! It doesn't get any fresher than that.   Feeling extra hungry that night, I also got the ramen. Toothy noodles, savoury broth, delicious pork, and a perfectly cooked egg. A very satisfying bowl.  We rounded out the night with more beer and sake bombs, which were off the hook. I could down ten of those if I could! ...but I can't. And wouldn't. Because that would get messy.  Great place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We're two young grads who wanted to check out a higher grade sushi/ izakaya and it was absolutely delicious! We loved the sashimi and squid tempura! It came at a rather hefty price and the waitress was not impressed with our tip. She asked why we didn't tip higher which left us with a bad taste in our mouths. However, before that we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I couldn't pass up on the opportunity of coming here when my friends found out that this place serves ramen until 1am. So I got them to order some random spicy ramen for me 'cause I was gonna be late.  What I had was probably the best ramen I've eaten in Calgary thus far. The noodles were my favorite part of the dish as they were slightly more firm than other places I've tried in town. I think the noodles were slightly thicker than other ramen shops as well. There was one giant slice of pork belly: fatty on the outside with a slight crisp on the inside (meaty section). The broth wasn't salty but flavorful with the right amount of spice. It didn't taste fatty either.  Very detailed in their food but it came at a price (pun intended): $16 for a bowl of ramen and a couple more toonies for extra noodles. That's stepping over my price range for ramen, but I like the atmosphere in here. Good spot for a date so men, bring your lady friends here!"}
{"text":"Every Calgary trip, I try to get in a bowl of ramen. With so many options as of late, it's easy to try a new spot. I came in on a late Thursday evening and the only place that I could think of that serves late night ramen was Shokunin. It's usually only available Friday and Saturday's after 10:00pm.  Their hours are great. Open late till 1:00am except Sunday (10:00pm).  The inside is cool, hip, moody and modern. It was just me so I grabbed a seat at the bar and got lucky; I was seated right at the yakitori grill so I got to see the chefs work their magic all night long.  The decor is chic with an anime mural of a bad ass chick giving off some intense attitude. Did I mention the beats? Old school r&b/hip hop had me in my happy place. Great vibes.  Nice touch that they give you a warm towel to wipe your hands with when you first sit down. Service was excellent and it was nice to see chef/co-owner Darren MacLean educating his staff and controlling the kitchen like a wizard.  - YYC ramen ($16.00) - I recall the waiter telling me that their broth is a mix of chicken and pork. The cha shu starts on the yakitori grill then is transferred and finished off in the oven. The miso cured egg was legit, broth was clean tasting with a nice layer of depth but the noodles could use some work.  I'll be back to try out their specialty charred yakitori skewers. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Shokunin, but unfortunately I left feeling very disappointed and underwhelmed.  I tried a variety of their menu items: the beef tongue gyozas came in a set of 4 and were tiny. I didn't like the texture of it as it tasted mushy. Next up was the Unagi style market fish, and while it was decent, there was nothing special about it. The title of this dish is somewhat misleading as it was essentially a rice bowl topped with the market fish of the day (not actually Unagi), What was \"Unagi\" about it was that the rice bowl was mixed with Kabayaki sauce, which is typically known to accompany Unagi. Of course, I had to try a couple of their skewers seeing as this is Shokunin's specialty, so my friend and I decided on the chicken heart and chicken ass, something that is different and not commonly available at other places. The flavours in both skewers were delivered without debate and probably the highlight of the night. However, the portions were tiny with 3 small bites per skewer, with skewers priced between $2.5-$4 depending on what you order. Last thing we ordered was the ramen bowl. This was probably the worst ramen bowl I tasted in Calgary. The broth was super salty and did not have an appetizing flavour. The toppings were mediocre, with the pork being rather tough and the egg close to being hardboiled.  Service was ehh... We ordered at 9:30pm, half an hour before late night ramen was available. We asked our server if she could ring in our ramen order when available, and was told that we would need to remind her as she will forget. She didn't even put an effort in trying to remember but just straight up told us that she can't do her job?  While the space is hip and trendy, I found the volume in the restaurant to be too loud with music blasting at a level that you would normally hear at a bar. It made it very difficult to hear my friend who was just sitting across from me.   Unfortunately, I'm not so sure I will return. Shokunin has a premium price tag but lacks in quality. Hopefully this is all due to being newly opened and they'll be able to work out the kinks soon enough."}
{"text":"We came here as this place was part of Calgary's 10 day fixed menu Summer Feast event. The place is located on trendy 4th Street, and the place is pretty trendy itself. The decor was cool and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  The fixed menu was a 3 course which allowed us to try one of their sashimi dishes, the tomato salad, and assortment of meats from their Yakitori menu. The dessert was a tasty Miso Yuzu Creme Brûlée.  We were impressed with the flavours and really enjoyed eat dish. I am a bit adventurous, so liked the chicken hearts they served us, although my wife wouldn't try them.  Note: they also have duck liver, chicken necks and beef tongue on their regular menu if you like trying the spare bits.  The service was awesome, they were great for explaining the menu and each dish. They were also very efficient and bringing the dishes and taking away the empty plates.   Since the idea of the summer feast is to attract new people to a restaurant, I was a little disappointed that they were out of certain drink and food choices off their menu. The only other thing was their drink menus were quite ratty, as if they were all ruined from being soaked in water."}
{"text":"Great service! Unique menu! What I didn't like was that I called for reservations and they made it seem like it was impossible to get in. I ended up having to cancel a 7pm reservation (because my husband lost his wallet) and asked if they could get me in a bit later. They said not 'til at least 9:30pm... Instead I booked online for 7:30pm and it worked. I chanced it and showed up. My reservation was valid and they seated us. As we sat there I noticed a lot of open tables so I'm sure we could've just did a walk in and get seated immediately. So besides that strange booking encounter I did end up enjoying the dinner. I'm glad we decided to show up rather than look for another restaurant that could take us instead. The food is definitely unique of great quality. It was easy to over order because everything looked so good! Their Wagyu beef from Japan was great, except we were way too full to enjoy it completely. Next time we'll have to take it easy on the ordering."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I actually love it here.  The restaurant ambiance is right up my alley; they have good music, perfect lighting and not pretentious while still getting good food and excellent service.  I've tried several things on the menu and everything has been delicious. You can't go wrong with whatever the daily sushi/sashimi special is (usually shipped in from Japan) and the yakitori.  We've tried the chicken karaage and the sweet corn kakiage which we both enjoyed. The only item of disappointment was the ramen. It's weird because everything that in the bowl is actually delicious but it's the broth that was bland.  It just need a little bit more soy or dashi and I think it would be perfect.  It's because the ramen comes at the end of the meal so we would have eaten a bunch of dishes that were quite seasoned so the ramen would need to be quite seasoned to not underwhelm the tastebuds. This restaurant is also open late so its one of the few places to get good food that isn't greasy."}
{"text":"The food here is good but its very expensive and the portion is really really small. For two people we ordered 6 dishes and the prices was $113 before tip. I was not like super full here.   I walked in but luckily I got a table quickly. Everyone who walks through the door has a reservation (in my opinion).   So we ordered 6 dishes.  Namerou Tartare ($17) Sashimi - Small ($24) Sweet Corn Kakiage ($10) Kara-age ($14) Short Rib ($27) Broxburn Tomato Salad ($16)  Total $108 plus tax = $113.40  I was not really full full. The food here is very pricy but it was good compared to Calgary Sushi standard.  The tartare was good but the crispy chip got soggy really quickly. The sashimi was fresh and its funny how the plate is so big and there are only 5 pieces of tiny shrimps, 4 pieces of fish. Sweet corn Kakiage is unique and I have to admit this is my first time trying the sweet corn dish. It was good. Kara-age was not bad. I did find it a bit salty. Short Rib was delicious but I did noticed there were a lot of burn parts but I am ok with it. The Broxburn Tomato salad is a bit upsetting. Its basically flavor from the tomato and not any other flavor. Would be nice if there are other things in that dish other then tomato.  Décor was nice. The restaurant is very small.   Right now they are doing a $35 special course dinner. But of course its a small version of what is on the regular menu. Not sure if its a good deal to order this. But to get it everyone at the table has to order.   Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Excellent sashimi, yakitori, and cocktails. Get the Park Hyatt in the Mist cocktail with tea smoke. If you're feeling splurgy get the wagyu beef with bone marrow - it was beyond amazing. I personally loved the beef tataki. My friend was happy to see sparkling sake on the menu, too. Given the quality of the food I thought the prices weren't unreasonable."}
{"text":"Came here Feb 11, 2017 after making a telephone reservation that was handled by Darren (chef and owner) in a humble, amusing way which carried on through to this evening in question. We were greeted right away by an attentive host (female) who in turn invited Darren to meet us (Darren has his finger on the pulse here) and were then led to the chef's table by Brody (one of the best waiters we have ever had the pleasure to meet!) so we could sit (his suggestion) while he cleaned a table for us. We liked the chef's table so much, we asked to stay put and that is where we spent the entire evening, sitting facing the wonderful wall mural! Upon Brody's suggestion, we opted for the omakase and for drinks I tried the home brew beer but ended up sticking with Asahi (I'm a wuss for light beer), and my partner had the Ome Negroni and later, again upon Brody's suggestion, the smoked Oma Negroni (both of which she loved!). The food started arriving and we were treated to the best chicken skin dish ever, perfect potato salad, two kinds of chicken yakitori (we ordered the chicken ass skewers as an additional treat), sashimi, two kinds of rice (not our favourite but definitely had flavour that supported the rest of the food), sous vide beef (flank), three kinds of vegetable, squid - so soft that we didn't realise it was squid at first, and chamame (a variation on edamame). It was all beautifully presented, a delight to the eyes, and tasted better than imagined! Our attentive waiter Brody and his colleagure (sorry didn't get his name but if we had to guess, would say he has a German accent) kept the evening flowing, and despite the business of a Saturday night, never rushed us, and let us stay at least for 2 hours. Brody ended up being better than exceptional, always cheery, smiling and informative - truly an asset to the restaurant! At the end of our meal, Brody was keen to reintroduce us to Darren who was in his element in the kitchen - Darren and Brody were keen to understand that we'd had an extremely memorable evening and had somehow through all this, remembered our names. We walked out of Shokunin on a high! Thanks and we'll be back because we excited to try the ramen!"}
{"text":"We had the good fortune of experiencing the omakase dinner at Shokunin tonight.  This was our second time here-the first was a slightly rocky BigTaste lunch, but after tonight, our image of this restaurant has completely changed, and for the better!  We were treated to a vast array of delicious food, including super fresh sushi and sashimi, flavourful miso broth, tasty skewers, interesting hot dishes, and finishing with luscious desserts.  The most memorable courses were the miso sablefish sushi (so buttery and melt in your mouth-I was thrilled to learn that this will be a regular sushi addition to the menu), the bone marrow and escargot (rich, but it was an interesting alternative to a more common escargot preparation), and the scallops-so beautifully presented on their shells on a small charcoal burner.  A shout out and thank you to chef and owner, Darren, and his team for this memorable meal-we are delighted to consider Shokunin as one of our top go-to Japanese restaurants in town now.  What a great introduction of the omakase experience to this city!    *Regretfully, we did not remember the name of our waitress, but she definitely contributed to our wonderful evening.  She was fantastic-genuine, efficient, friendly, and so good with our one year old!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  Darren the master chef is also a master host. He can be seen floating through the restaurant engaging his clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great experience food wise and atmosphere wise.  The music was hip hop when we got there around 10:30 and it was sick old school beats.   The cocktails were DELICOUS. I liked their bar service and the uniqueness of the drinks they offered. When I heard we were going to a Japenese restaurant I was worried about sake and more sake only. I was very happy to discover not the case AT ALL.   The food selection was incredible. There was a range of food items all over and things I would never have typically tried (Like chicken skin chips) BUT they were to die for.  Thanks for the great experience. I cannot wait to come back and bring some girlfriends out. :D"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences possible in Calgary. This is one of the only restaurants in town with an owner/executive chef that truly cares and walks around his dining room to make sure that the quality is up to the highest standard.   Really recommend the chicken tail skewers and the beef tongue gyoza, out of this world. I'll be back over and over again for the Ramen as well. Try it with butter!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service. Our waiter was very genuine and friendly. The food was very high quality and a lot of details went into it. Everything was flavorful. We got the seared raw buffalo, raw shrimps, ramen, cabbage salad. We were very impressed. The price you pay definitely is worth it for the kind of food and service you get. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place has heart. I came once with a large group of friends and tried just about everything. It's very thoughtful food that's delicious with great flavours and textures. You won't find anything like it in Calgary. The only downside was the waitress made a bit of a flub by adding the bottle of sake to the person's bill who ordered it even though all of us had some. It made things a little awkward. She should have asked how we wanted to pay for it. Overall the evening was excellent. Great ambiance too.   I went back another day for ramen. Words won't do it justice. It was gorgeous, even sensual. I'll definitely be back for more with friends in tow."}
{"text":"I dropped by Shokunin after work for a cocktail and a chicken isaw  before the long walk home and was surprised with a dinner plate complimentary, courtesy of the uber brilliant and mercurial YYC chef Darren who believed that I should not live on cocktails and grilled chicken skins alone (LOL) -- voila! an incredible sablefish delicately grilled with velvety undertones like a prima Donna ballerina on her debut at the MET, technically flawless yet abounding with such sweetness; complete with her entourage of pickled red onions, fried garlic  and tempura beer hop with a citrus dipping sauce - yes, this must be the grand encore of all encores on what had been a long dreary work night when foodie heaven revealed itself and I am happily tripping on sugar coated candy clouds clapping, BRAVO! #shokuninyyc. PS Careful, Chef. I may be compelled to issue you and your menu a sexy citation the next time I come around...."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Overpriced and everything is to share. Be prepared to spend alot and leave hungry.  I would not come back"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try out Shokunin one night after I saw it on the Canada 100 best restaurants list and it did not disappoint. We ordered the gyoza dumplings, chicken skin chips, bison gyu sashi, sashimi, a few of the different yakitori, and the miso creme brulee. The highlights were definitely the bison, gyoza, and chicken skin chips. Unfortunately I've been thinking about these dishes regularly and will have to make another visit to this establishment very soon lol. As for drinks, the plum fashioned was delicious and was the best cocktail we tried. *Visited August/17"}
{"text":"The cost does not justify the food.  $3 for 2 shitake mushrooms, $4 for 3 shisito peppers, everything else is 1 skewer with a couple pieces of meat on it. For something that is just cooked over charcoal fire and is considered street food in Japan... pretty sure you could just do this yourself.    Miso soup for $7? Better be a bowl that feeds 5.   Ramen that doesn't even come with the egg, costs $2 extra.  Butter in your ramen, $2?   3oz butcher cut grass fed beef for $30  I had super high hopes for this place, complete let down. Our bill was ~$65 + tip, barely made a dent in our appetite (2 nikkas, all the grilled items and the duck tataki), went to anejo after, ~$65 as well for 2 3oz chili coconut margaritas and 6 tacos. Stuffed. Value for dollar just isn't there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday, the place was empty, so it was kind of annoying that the host seated us beside the only other 2 people in the restaurant, but whatever.   We decided to order the ramen since I've seen Shokunin's ramen being heavily promoted on various Calgary food and entertainment Instagram pages. They only serve the ramen during lunch and late night, so I was surprised that the place was so dead for lunch. The host later explained that they make the ramen in the only big oven they have to keep the broth warm for longer, hence only serving it at select times during the day.   The ramen was ok, it was good but I kind of expected more due to all the hype yyc_living and other Calgary Instagram accounts gave it. The broth was kind of bland, but... Protip: ask for some hot sauce. Shokunin actually gives you this special hot sauce, not like the typical siracha or anything, it's a hot sauce that's very flavorful with actual garlic at the bottom, so it definitely made the broth better.   We also ordered the karrage chicken, it was so juicy and tender without any bones in it, definitely dreaming about that right now as I'm writing this, so check it out.  Not sure if the servers are usually that friendly or if it's just because the place was dead that they were bored and talked to us so much, but the host and server were both really friendly and knowledgable, so the service was great.   Overall I would come back here again, maybe not exclusively just for the ramen, but curious to try the shittake mushroom and some of their other dishes that was rated as very popular on the menu, but not available at lunch time. Kind of annoying how not everything on the menu is always available, but it seems like they only have 2 chefs so that's understandable! Shokunin was kind of expensive, but I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"5/5 We went back to give Shokunin another shot outside the Big Taste Calgary event and were really impressed with the food and service! First off, thank you to Darren and staff for the fabulous dinner! The service and ambience were both great. We could talk without having to yell and we were well taken care of at the kitchen bar. Darren was kind enough to take us through our meal and through the ingredients and their sourcing.   The course he had set out for us was well balanced and the seasonings were on point. The ingredient quality was also very good, especially by Calgary standards. Ahem... and here comes the slew of delicious food! The courses came as follows:  King crab miso soup - the shells were used in the stock which made a beautiful rich and flavorful soup. If you're here on a cold day, definitely have some miso soup to warm up.   Sashimi - shima aji, hiramasa, albacore tuna, tai, coho salmon and smoked trout roe. The hiramasa and shima aji were my favourites! Good fish quality  Bison tataki - this was beautiful and the flavours were bold! The acidity and citrus from the yuzu pickled onions and the crispy fried garlic bits came together well to match the soft but rich bison which was lean and sliced to a good thinness  Aburi style gindara - I am a total sucker for black cod, also known as sablefish or butterfish. This aburi nigiri was melt in my mouth delicious with a mayo, miso sauce complimenting the buttery flavour of the fish and the delicate texture. If you ever want to woo me with food, this right here is the way to do it!  Grilled cabbage - we love grilling leafy greens at home and this grilled napa cabbage was no exception! It came with kimizu sauce which I learned today is a Japanese sauce similar to a dairy free hollandaise that I must now go dig up a recipe for! This sauce along with the fried garlic, pickled onion, scallions and what tasted like nori powder made for a dish I could have eaten pile of!  Scallop and uni nigiri straight from Hokkaido and never frozen! It's been a while since I've had seafood this good! The last time I had uni this good was IN Hokkaido lol! The scallop was also amazing and I'm wondering how Darren managed to pick all my favourite nigiri choices :P The only thing missing from my top 3 list was ikura with uzura!  Clam fritter - sweet clam fritters made with sweet potato and drizzled with honey. The oil had been drained well so it was nice and crispy without being too heavy. All the flavours melded well and the clam flavour isn't overly prevalent... perhaps a good gateway into shellfish if someone isn't familiar and isn't feeling too adventurous.   Pickled eggplant - this was another fabulous light dish with pickled eggplant in a sweet dashi soy based sauce. Very similar sauce to that used for agadashi tofu which really complimented the pickled eggplant.  Bison gyoza - served with Serrano pepper sauce. I really enjoyed this gyoza and the sauce had an acidic ponzu type base that, along with the spicy kick, cut nicely through the rich bison  Yakitori time! Served with a soy based egg yolk dip. There were chicken hearts, ass, and oysters,  wagyu beef,  and beef tongue. The chicken hearts had good texture and the ass and oysters were tender and rich. Wagyu was tender and done medium rare which was perfect for us. The beef tongue was stellar with the length of the tongue shaved and folded to ensure a wonderful texture that used both the fatty and leaner parts.   Finished with a miso creme brulee. I'm not an expert on brulees  but this tasted great! Also, i can't recommend the Kiiro cocktail enough! Refreshing and a great match for the sashimi and nigiri!  Thank you to Shokunin for a great dinner and I encourage everyone to buy the kitchen a six pack for all their hard work! I would definitely recommend you check this izakaya out! I'll be back to try more, including the ramen!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a updated review! I recently came here with a girlfriend of mine because we're late night snackers and a big bonus of this place is that they're open until 1am 6 out of the 7 days a week! We initially came for ramen and while I've had their ramen before, it unfortunately didn't leave a huge impression for me, but I was definitely willing to give it another try and see maybe I was having an off day.   We were greeted and promptly seated, as we came pretty late on a weekday night. As it was my girlfriend's first time, the server was great in explaining the story behind Shokunin and gave us each a warm towel to freshen up. We got some green tea (that was brought in from Japan) to start and it was perfectly brewed. The owner and chef, Darren, came out and introduced himself and welcomed us to his restaurant. He was incredibly friendly and gave us some personal recommendations from the menu. You can see he was incredibly knowledgable in Japanese cuisine and definitely makes an effort to connect with each of his guests. We decided on getting some of the recommendations which included the sashimi platter (which included fresh fish flown from Japan the previous day), squid tempura, scallop isoyaki, ruri nasu (eggplant) and several different types yakotori. Let me just say, we. we're. blown. away.   All the recommendations that Darren gave to us were INCREDIBLE. The eggplant caught me off guard and I HIGHLY suggest that you get it, even if you don't like eggplant, this is a good dish to introduce yourself to it. You can taste the freshness of the fish from the sashimi and the use of real wasabi (not the horseradish + green food colouring) just makes a world of a difference. The yakotoki were also delicious and full of flavour. My personal favourites were the beef tongue, thigh and mushroom. The dipping sauce that comes with it perfectly complemented the smokiness of the skewers.   The scallops come out cooking over in their own shells on top of their Japanese imported coal that they use, which was super cool! The squid tempura is also so good, especially with that spicy mayo, you can never go wrong with spicy mayo.   I love the atmosphere of this place. It combines two of my favourite things, old school rap with Japanese food. It's slightly on the pricer side, but for the quality of the service and food, it was worth it."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by this restaurant. Good atmosphere, not too loud music. Servers are friendly and professional. When they serve dishes, they gave me explanations what they cooked the meal, like high-end restaurants do. I felt they care food and customers. I tried some kushiyaki which are better than other yakitori places in Calgary. They put some twists to their kushiyaki. I think it worked. I know I shouldn't compare real Japanese kushiyaki, but if they apply basic techniques of bbqing yakitori, meat would be more juicier and smokier. That is only reason, I couldn't give 5 stars. I tried chamame, which is similar to edamame but a little sweeter. It was good company with beer. Also they have a couple of original beer, which are worth trying. Lastly, their ramen was very good considering not from specialized ramen place. Actually, their ramen is more crafted than some ramen places.   I will definitely come back Shokunin. I am hoping they will develop more kinds of kushiyaki."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner and loved the entire experience.  We had a fantastic server who took time to explain the menu, drinks, and specials - throughout the evening he was attentive and easygoing.    We asked him to surprise us with a bunch of food from the menu he thought would be nice - but included a few must haves - he made some excellent choices that we otherwise never would have tried. Some favourites to note:  the eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and drizzled with honey, corn fritters (sounds lame but honesty these were like a heavenly bite of summer), wagyu beef, sashimi, and the bison tataki.    The cocktails here were also incredible - we had three each and every single one was so delicious.  We had an amazing anniversary dinner and can't wait to go back!"}
