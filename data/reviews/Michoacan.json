{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at just because the food is O-so-Delicious. The tortillas is the best tortillas I have ever tried just because it's made fresh.   This time I ordered the chipotle lengua (cow tongue), I know it sounds nasty but hey it taste good. The lengua came with rice and bean's, guacamole. The rice was good, bean's not a bean fan so didn't get it, guacamole was good. For dessert I ordered churros, came with 4 small churros and whipped cream. When I first came here I ordered the steak rancheros, I would recommend trying it.   I would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers. The service is great, food is great, and the place itself is nice and clean."}
{"text":"I love love the food here the only problem is the servers don't speak English that good so at times it's hard to communicate and the bussers almost never do so getting drinks etc can be difficult especially if you cant find your server."}
{"text":"I went there at 2:30 pm on a Saturday. I was surprised to learn that it was Happy Hour on a Saturday!!! The hours are from 2-5pm, Mon-Sat. The food was delicious! I got the carne asada (beef) nachos and Camarones (shrimp) creme! I also had a Cadillac margarita. I will definitely suggest going there for your Mexican food fix. You can count on me being a repeat customer. The service is 5 star. Very nice, humble and professional staff."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mostly just rice and beans. Salsa was watered down. My first time at this location and it will be my last. Bussers run there ass off and servers seem to do nothing. Took forever for are food to get there and when it did it was cold. When I complained to the manager he barely spoke English. Anyways if you looking for great Mexican food look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit here! The staff were extremely nice and accommodating. The food was yummy and the prices were awesome! Our meal was fresh and the chips (served with salsa and beans) along with soup was delicious! Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"I really love this place great food and great place to work i used to be a server assistant and everyone was nice specially mark the owner very nice person thank you for everything mark :)"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Great atmosphere, yummy chip and salsa and every entree I've tried has been great. Don't forget to try a Margarita, they can make any kind you like. Staff is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to try this tonight and it was sooo good!  Service was awesome and the food OMgoodness!  Great atmosphere,  great service, great prices!"}
{"text":"I can not thank Mark, Kyle and his staff enough for making my father-in-laws 90th birthday party one he will never forget. I live in California and was able to reserve their patio area for my 40 guests, they put the King robe, crown and scepter on my father-in-law (which I provided), walked him through the restaurant where we all waited for him to walk into the patio area on his red carpet (I provided) to yell \"surprise\". They allowed me to come an hour and a half early so that I could decorate the patio with my own decorations and even provided me with 2-extra 6 ft. tables to put my collage pictures, cake, and presents on. They even enclosed the patio and set-up portable heaters to keep us warm; due to the cold weather.    The accommodations were amazing!  I was able to choose different options from their menu for our guests to choose from and they made me personalized menus for my guests which kept the cost low to fit my budget. We had chips, salsa, guacamole and nachos as our appetizers and our guests had the choice of: Fajitas for 2, 3 Tacos plate (Carne Asada, Pollo Asado, or Carnitas), Burritos, along with a kids menu and much more. Once our servers took   everyone's individual orders, our food was out hot, fresh and Delicious within 30 minutes. We had family and friends fly in from: California, Arizona, Oklahoma and Colorado and every single one of my guests complemented on the food and service they were provided. They even cut the cake we brought and served it to each of our guests and made sure my father-in-law was served first!!   I have my own Mexican food catering service in California (Baja Style Tacos Catering Service) and I have very high standard and I have to say, I was very impressed with everything they did for me, their food was great and I highly recommend Michoacan!    I can't thank you all enough for taking so much stress off of me while I was trying to put this birthday party together for my father-in-law from California and made it a special day we will all never forget.   Thank you,  Inga Garner"}
{"text":"The food here is always great. Unfortunately, the service is hit or miss. I always get the cheese enchiladas and one beef taco. The taco shells are freshly made and the beef is shredded instead of ground. They also have great albondigas soup.   Three stars because of inconsistent service."}
{"text":"gour*met (grme, gr me)   n.  1. a connoisseur of fine food and drink; epicure. adj. 2. of, characteristic of, or designed for gourmets. 3. of or involving fancy or exotic foods.  They should remove the word \"gourmet\" from the restaurant sign.   The chips were pretty good. The service was lacklustre and ambivalent (would it kill you to smile, mr waiter?). The lighting was too bright. The chile relleno was soggy and swimming in tomato saucey water (whuuuut?). The burrito was huge but also swimming next to the relleno and a bit soggy (I felt guilty for having had an animal live and die just to go into that).   I don't know what the high reviewers see in this place...maybe other reviewers have assessed it rightly that they just don't know good quality food. Maybe the giant portion sizes impress them; for me, it's just more bad food. I actually prefer Taco Bell to this overpriced underwhelming \"gourmet\" restaurant. I was craving Leticia's but they were closed. Next time I'll just wait. This place has Leticia's prices but not even fast food quality.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Vegas as far as authentic Mexican food. Unless you go to SoCal and go to a little taqueria, you won't get better Mexican food! I've had the chiles relleno, carne asada, several different carnitas and steak type dishes and they are all top notch. Good prices for a nice sit down type restaurant. Me and the wife usually both eat for around $40, tip included. The Don Fransisco is my favorite dish, it's a nice size piece of carne asada smothered in melted queso, chiles, and cebollas...YUM! Also the atmosphere is awesome with live marriachi/rancheras music! The service is also top notch, and the waiters are very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu! And as any person who knows comida Mexicana will tell you...try the salsa and the frijoles first...if they are good, then so will the food be. And they are both AWESOME here! 5 STARS all the way! Been here at least 10times, and will continue to go back about once a month or so till I leave Vegas in December!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went there for happy hour. We ordered the tableside guacamole.  It was ok. Nothing special. When we received our bill, they not only tried to charge us full price for our drinks, they tried to charge us for premium liquors we never ordered. We had to call a manager over to fix it. They tried to overcharge us by $30. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  Went here for my birthday; there were seven of us.  Six of us got sick with one going to doctor and being diagnosed with viral hepatitis...that comes from employees who don't wash hands after restroom use and transfers bowel or urine remnant to the foods during prep.  That then resulted in acute pancreatitis.  Missed work for a week and a half.  Most miserable week ever!  Do yourself a favor...DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The manager / co-owner Kyle was not helpful at all. I had order takeout and was giving  the wrong meal. Kyle refused to give me a refund or even replace my food with the correct meal. Pretty much I was told it was my fault for receiving the wrong meal."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places.  We have been coming for years.  The food is good. Maybe not the most earth shattering Mexican food I've ever had,  but good.  We have been coming so long we all have our favorite dishes. My daughters both go crazy for the sopa de fideo.  I love the grilled fish tacos or the ensalada marinera.  My husband loves the carnitas, flautas, and sopitos.   We have recently discovered their brunch buffet and I'm now amiss that we hadn't been going for years prior. Most of their best menu options are available but the best thing is the pan dulce. I don't know if they make it in house or have it brought in but the conchas are to die for.  The biggest reason we have been regular patrons so long and will continue to be is the staff. Some of the servers have literally watched our kids grow up. They're always so kind and effecient."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, the quality gets worse and worse.  We came tonight only out of convenience and won't be returning.  They've always cooked the meats to well done but now it seems like they are pre cooking the meats then cooking again upon ordering to the point of shoe leather toughness.  My husbands carnitas was actually deep fried. It came out hard as a rock and dripping with grease.  Gross"}
{"text":"Good eats. But not too fascinating. Forgetful waiter...on a slow late lunch hour. Monday's children 12yrs and under eats free (children menu) with paying adults.  Overall though, not a terrible place. If I'm being honest, it's not a place I'd feel excited about coming back to. I like Mexican food, but it didn't \"wow\" me.   Wish they offered a good salsa rather than two type of dips with chips.  Frozen margarita was great though."}
{"text":"The Michoican restaurants have always been a favorite of mine.  The quality of the food and the service is exceptional and the variety of dishes is surprising for a mexican restaurant.  I took my mom for lunch and she really loved it!  She was a little apprehensive about the spicy heat factor but they fixed that up for her!"}
{"text":"food was delicious  excellent excellent service.. mariachi was very nice. drinks awesome very very fast   service cups always full. guacamole prepared instantly in your table. impressed with restaurant. thank you."}
{"text":"Always delish & fast! Can get busy on weekends but somehow they manage to seat. Pretty quick. The ONLY complaint is that the entry to wait is so tiny and gets backed up but the outside area is huge and has pillars to sit  to wait and perfect if you have kids to run around. It's not like there are tons of screaming kids and is dark so can be a nice little date place but oerfect for family dinner too. They cater too for events! Btw if you wait outside ,just let the host know so they don't skip you when you're called. They get busy because it's good! LIndo resturaunts have been a well known family owned resturaunt name in town for years. This location is smaller but great service. Their pick up service is super fast and always right and good. Even the sides and extras. My fam has eaten at the original for years (before the original fire even in the 90's) I can remember being a kid watching them make handmade tortillas. All the locations are good but my favs have to be the original location and this centennial location. FYI it's next to Red Robin (it can be hard to see from street but has same parking location). Cute dark place and covered seating outside avail w/ heated lamps in the winter if needed on patio area. Has a great little bar inside too.  Staff is very nice. This place has lots of regulars. Because it's very good and they treat their guests good. We have them cater our Christmas dinner every year and it's so easy and good. I think if the order is over a certain amount they even deliver for catering but I'd check on that. Also the best desserts are the sopapillas! Yumm, this review made me so hungry that I just called to order pick up :0 Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good cadilac margaritas! Owner is super nice and accommodating, making sure his customers are happy. Don't care for the red sauce they use."}
{"text":"Great food but our server Cesar was inattentive and was rude. He had an attitude about him that he brought to all of the tables I saw him wait on"}
{"text":"as a recent resident of Las Vegas it was imperitive that i find an amazing mexican joint.. Lindo is legit.. great salsas, great service.. legit food.. however they charge what you would expect to see on the strip.. if the food were a bit cheaper i would give this place 4 or 5 stars.."}
{"text":"My wife & I frequent this restaurant in NW Las Vegas whenever we go out for Mexican food. The various camarones dishes are my favorite, always good. We've been to many restaurants in LV over the past 20 years - this is one of the best managed places we've been to. I always figure, if the restrooms are spotless, that's probably indicative of the cleanliness of the cooking areas. This owner takes special care in running an establishment where the customer is king. Because he is focused on the customer we often go out of our way to give him our business. I'd highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"We had lunch here with family.  The chips are fine but their salsa is little more than a red pepper sauce, no tomatoes or other ingredients.  I ordered a combination plate with a green verde pork burrito and the green sauce was so over powering that it ruined the dish.  The beef enchilado was o-kay but the chicken taco was dry. My wife had the vegetable fajitas and the vegetable mix was little more than a lot of green peppers and little else... Not returning here....."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5-10 times. The service here is amazing every single time. The food is above average.   On my first visit i had fresh guac made at my table and one of the servers was singing to guests.  On my last visit i took my family there while they were in town (My mom loves the cognac chicken). There were about 7of us including 2toddlers. Everyone was so sweet and patient. The owner or manger even came out and asked how everything was.   Almost every meal has come with a soup. My kids love it.  I love enchiladas, theirs aren't the best. I think it's the sauce.. idk.. My husband gets the burrito bionico. It's huge, he loves it. And I'd say He's a burrito expert.   The complimentary chips are always fresh, they give you yummy Salsa, not too spicy, very tasty. They also give you a bean dip. I'm not a fan of beans but i love their bean dip.   Fresh tortillas  They give you a free warm churro if you can pronounce one of the Mexican countries. That was fun.   Every hostess, server, has been very attentive.  Decor is old school Mexican, very cute."}
{"text":"We heard this was a great place for Mexican food and they were right. We had the enchiladas and tacos the food was very good and the place is every clean. A nice little date place I must say. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I always get GREAT service and good food here.   Plus you can't beat the price.   I haven't had a drink here so I can't rate the bar."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, but it's also not my favorite. The sauces are a little strange., but I think it's because of the region the food is from. I'm just not used to it. I really like the corn tortilla quesadilla that is on the appetizer menu. I tried to order a vegetarian burrito and they brought me a burrito that was just filled with grilled peppers and onions, like the veggies that come with fajitas. It was inedible, but they made up for it with the live music. There is something totally awesome about a Mexican version of Radiohead's \"Creep\". I have to idea why the guy played it but it was hilarious. That alone made it worth the meal."}
{"text":"I tried them out this past Sunday for the brunch buffet thing. I'm not a fan of buffets but I was craving Mexican but had no idea what kind so I figured buffet I would get a little of everything. I was very impressed with the dishes served and the presentation of it. The food was freshly made and was always being checked on and replaced. The 3 different kind of fajitas was my favorite and the eggs omelet station was also pretty good. I was made huevos rancheros right in front of my rather than scoop out of a tray. Great experience here. Staff was very attentive As well"}
{"text":"First time here for Sunday Brunch and either   I'm invisible or they don't like the football jersey that I'm wearing but I can't get any service... 5 different servers keep walking by taking care of everyone else in my section but not one asks me if I need anything or even looks my way... I won't be back here again..."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you love Mexican food you definitely have to try this place out! My favorite is hands down the flour tortilla chicken flautas! This is a great mixture with the complimentary chips salsa and beans that you get before you order! Also they have a Sunday brunch buffet that is always a great deal. From the homemade tortillas to the Mexican favorites for breakfast. Juevos con hamon, chile verde con pollo, bacon! Always got to have bacon! It's just a great atmosphere with live music playing"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This use to be my \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. No more. Prices are outrageous! Beans were without flavor and the green chili was over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"The manager was extremely nice and welcoming. As we were leaving he asked us how we liked the food which is rare to hear. The food was good and the prices reasonable.  If you're craving mexican food then this place will definitely satisfy you.  The authenticity is close, but of course,  not quite there.  The tortillas are handmade however and delicious. The only downsides,  in my opinion,  are the small wait area and the waiter never refilling my water,  which is a must when you have spicy salsa on the table.  Other than that, I left the establishment with a smile.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food but nothing really stands out as being memorable.  The service is good but their is better Mexican to be had up the road on Durango at Leticia's."}
{"text":"Good authentic-like Mexican food. This place was recommended by a good friend of ours.   As soon as you get seated you are given chips/salsa and refried beans. We came in at the beginning of their Happy Hour- good time to come if you want to maximize your dollar. We ordered 2 Mango margaritas along with a cheese quesadilla. The Mango margaritas were okay. They were heavy on the tequila but the mango lacked flavor. Not sure what that was about but it wasn't too bad because we did manage to finish the drink.   We came here because I was craving Mexican food. I specifically wanted Cheese Enchiladas with green sauce. My friends ordered a burrito and a Flautas plate. Their food came as they had ordered it but unfortunately, my enchiladas came in red sauce. I immediately told our waiter and it was quickly fixed.  Food was okay. Not sure if I'd come back here again.  Considering how slow it was (2pm) their service was extremely slow. Even after we received our food the waiter only came once to check up on us. So if you're not in a hurry or have time to wait around come here."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Mexican food. I always get the shrimp enchiladas which is amazing. My wife gets the fajitas which is always too much for her to eat & is the best in town with the tortillas made onsite. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Being Hispanic & knowing what this food should taste like, you have a better chance of getting more authentic at Taco Bell. The food is awful, tastes NOTHING like Mexican food. So tasteless, definitely different from my first visit but that was on the eastside of Vegas so that might be why."}
{"text":"Awful service!!! Our server, Cesar did not serve us well and our he was very rude. He did not refill our chips and salsa at all. He was also very slow at getting our or stuff and made our visit very unpleasant. When we told the another waiter they were very understand and apologized for Cesar's behaviors. The rest of the waiters were very sweet to us. Cesar, however did not apologize for his rudeness and lack of morale:"}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good Mexican dishes with friendly service.  I love that they make their corn tortillas right in front of you and the chips are always fresh and delicious.  Please DO NOT confuse this with the Lindo Michoacán locations as I do NOT like them at all as their quality is significantly less than Michoacan location in Centennial.  Give them a try, worth the drive as excellent food and I have NOT had bad service in all the times that I have been here."}
{"text":"This is a late review, since I ate there last in September, but since my family just went there over the weekend, I feel I can rely on it still being a fantastic place.  One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  It was as high end as it gets for a Mexican restaurant without being stupid.  The handmade tortillas (which you see being produced in the window) are to die for.  The service was very helpful.  My go-to, enchiladas, were fantastic.  Take it from this Southern California Latino, Michoacan is a must-do.  If Michoacan want to come to Long Beach, I'd be happy to help!"}
{"text":"Give me a break this place sucks big time it's over price. I don't mind paying top dollars for good quality food. I order their steak plate it wasn't even close to a real steak it was DIESMILLO which is one of the cheapest meat cuts of the the beef for that price I was expecting at least a beef skirt steak."}
{"text":"good food, good vibe, good music, I live close by there and been going there for over 6yrs, once in a good while with the family.  They been raising there prices more and more it seem every time I go back it gets pricier and pricier but same food same drinks nothing to different just there price change. I do recommend a drink; Micheladas are really good my fav with modelo beer!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone there is so sweet. They always make you feel like a guest at their home. The food is good too."}
{"text":"I love this place been here 100 times! Been some slip ups but always fixed. With a smile always!"}
{"text":"I got the fish tacos and they were outstanding.  My rice and beans were delicious.  The customer service was perfect.  I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. It was ok. Not anything spectacular.  The plan was to go to Olive Garden but the wait was an hour so my husband and I decided to give Michoacan a shot.  We walked in and there was a small empty table right by the server station. The hostess told me it was going to take 30 minutes to an hour with only a large group waiting.  When I looked at the table than looked at the hostess she corrected herself than immediately sat us. We thought we got lucky until I realized she told everyone it was a hour wait but could be 5 minutes then everyone including a table of 11 was quickly seated.  I noticed on both the food and drink menus that there are extra charges for almost everything.  I got flautas and had to pay extra for flour tortillas and any flavor additions to the margaritas cost more and all thru the menu its $1for this or $ 2 for that.  I thought it was a little tacky.   My husband got a shrimp burrito and said it was rubbery.  The flautas were just Ok.  The guacamole was good. My husband actually ate it which is rare for him.    All and all it was edible but if Olive Garden is full again I will drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"2 stars only for the service. The waiter tried so hard to keep us there. Our food took almost 1 1/2 hrs for us to get Friday night 10/21. I ordered a 12oz chicken breast with cognac sauce and  my husband ordered the orange roughy.   My chicken was sooooo over cooked I couldn't even cut it. Beans were dried out and crusted over.  Rice was crunchy. So either they had it done and kept it under the light so it over cooked or the chef really doesn't know when to take food off the grill.  The fish was filled with bones.  I actually left the bones in the bill holder to show them.  I have eaten there before many times and it has never been amazing but it was fine.  Last night was terrible it has made it so I will not go back. The owner knew and something was up.  He kept coming around apologizing to people.  Would have rather gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I've honestly eaten here at least once a month over the last couple of years with different friends and family. Some have loved it and some have not but have never personally had a bad experience until now.  The good: it was a weekday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. The hostess is always friendly as was our waiter this time. Fresh chips, warm bean dip and tortillas being made just a few feet away.  The bad: ordered a chicken enchilada but was served beef. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, he informed me I could find chicken in the other half of the enchilada and then walked away. Really?   The ugly: the sopa tarasca was extra oily. So much so, I could only take a few bites. We asked for the check three times and every time was told \"oh my god I'm so sorry\". 45 minutes later we got our check after our party of four stood up to walk out because we couldn't wait for it anymore.   Three stars because aside from the oily soup, everyone enjoyed their food. Even my beefy chicken enchilada."}
{"text":"I ended up eating here by pure chance. I was headed to Red Robin when I saw this place next door. I decided to eat Mexican food, and I'm glad I did. The staff was friendly and quick with the service. They were making tortillas in plain view of the restaurant behind a plexiglass enclosure. The food was terrific. I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Food is spectacular and the service and atmosphere are very welcoming.  It would have gotten a 5 from us, but it is a little on the pricey side.  Great for a nice night out. Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Good food made fresh. Excellent service, decent price & clean atmosphere is a plus."}
{"text":"Great food, exceptional service and a nice atmosphere. The recipe for a perfect restaurant. Will recommend and will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The enchilada sauce, from a can, had no heart. I ordered the Etole (corn on cob) it was rotten on the end.  The Spanish rice was very dry. Refried beans were bland no flavor, no soul. Service was good. Table side guacamole was good and fresh.  I believe one can always tell how good a Mexican restaurant is by their refried beans. I won't return. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Check in and get 3 free churros!  I got the pork burrito, asked for no pick but they gave it to me anyway, dinged them a star for not doing \"special\" requests such as no onions or no pico. Very friendly and prompt staff, my drink glass was never empty. I found the food to be a little dull, I like spicy food and this had zero heat. The burrito was as big as my head! Portions are very large."}
{"text":"Since our visit a month ago, this restaurant has gone from extraordinary to ordinary.  The shrimp have gone in size from huge to tiny size.  The service was slow and it took forever to get our food.  The sauces are still wonderful but I don't think we will eat here again due to the portion size and the slow service.  By the way this  is Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant, not Lindo Michoacan, but a part of that chain.  The address above is correct but I noticed that many of the reviews are for Lindo Michoacan and not the one on Tropical Pky."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst food I've ever tasted. The beef, chicken, and shrimp in our tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas were super dry and tasteless. The lettuce salad mix they served on my tacos and tostadas looked like it came out of those prepackaged salad mixes. The carrot slaw on my taco was dry, it was white and flaky. The staff was friendly. This is the third time we dined here and we will never return. The food was bad to mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and two daughters. Had a little wait no problem expected, had options to be seated outside under the patio. Ok no problem, got our drinks with in 15 min ok it's busy, no big deal. Orderd our food , had guacamole for a app. Made at the table was great, a little chunky  and under seasoned, I'm ok still staying possitve for a good day, no silverware or napkins at the table, ask the waiter to bring some. Puts a pile of forks spoons and knives in the middle of the table. Ok still staying possitve. Then the wait, 38 min ( yes I was timing)  I asked the waiter about the time and said it was coming. 10 min later food came, everyones food was warm at best. Not a good experience for a specail day. If it's a matter of being busy should have not seated people. This location is closed for me."}
{"text":"Nothing in my meal really stood out.  The carnitas were tender, but had absolutely no flavor and that seemed to be the theme of my meal.  Everything was rather bland and unexciting.  Service was fine, in that chain-restaurant-I'm-reading-from-a-script sort of way. I had been told good things about these restaurants with some people claiming it was quite authentic.  When it comes to Mexican food, I have equal love for authentic and full-on cheese sauce covered American, as long as it's done well.  This wasn't either."}
{"text":"I've this place many times since 2012. Food:Decent. Nothing spectacular.  Happy Hours:Great price and large selection. A little pricey for regular meals. Drinks: Seem diluted.  Server: Its a hit or miss. There are times, my guest and I waited 20 minutes before a server was available to take our order. No biggie.  Overall...food is decent. Service can be 10/10 sometimes or a 2/10. Hit or miss..  Would I return: Sure."}
{"text":"Great service and not too pricey. The food is very authentic and the fried ice cream is to die for. The booths are bit of a tight squeeze but not crazy. Enviroment feels authentic and very homey. Will always go here as long as it is open!"}
{"text":"We tried this place a couple of years ago and weren't impressed.  Thinking perhaps we may have just hit them on an off night, we decided to give them another chance last week.  Sad to say, we should have stayed with our first impression.  After we were seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there and at least get some water.  This was just the beginning of extremely poor service.  When our food arrived, mine was wrong.  I had ordered beef enchiladas and received chicken.  When I pointed it out to our server, he offered to take it back, but being that my spouse had already been served, it didn't seem fair for their food to go cold while waiting for mine, so I just accepted what they served.  As before, the first time we were there, the food itself barely made mediocre.  Mexican cusine is one of my absolute favorites and this one repeatedly falls short.  There is no life in their plates.  The food just sits there begging to be taken away.  It is bland and unimaginative and very unsatisfying.  I understand that this is one of three or four locations Michoacan has in the greater Las Vegas area.  This one has runied the brand for me and I most assuredly will not be returning here or to any of the other locations."}
{"text":"When this place first opened we came and did not enjoy any aspect...this time the food was great.. First they bring you chips and salsa AND an awesome bean dip! I got the chicken flautas which were heaven ... Only issue was getting our check at the end.. Had to flag someone down finally!! But I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here. Waiter was awesome, food was excellent. The beef tongue was so tender and the sauce was perfect."}
{"text":"I remember this place being awesome a few years back. The one in Henderson was always delicious! We went a week or so ago and it was nothing special. The soup was tasteless, I had to throw our salsa in it to add flavor (salsa was delicious!) The chicken taco doesn't stand a chance next to Juan's Flaming Fajitas (Trop and Ft Apache) or Casa Don Juan (Main St). It was pretty mediocre and had yellow cheese on it (yuck!) Our server seemed nice but very dry and not friendly at all. He especially got a little annoyed with me when I told him they added chicken in my soup that I had asked for with no chicken. Our food also took about 30-35 min to come out, with only about 5 tables in the entire restaurant. We'll stick to one of the Juans I previously mentioned to get our Mexican on from now on. This location ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day to get a quick drink and a snack before an appt I had 45 min later. We sat at the bar (which in most places gets the fastest service) to ensure we could get in and out quickly.   We saw a lot of bus boys servicing the tables and booths in the bar area, and the occasional waiter, but the bar? Crickets. There wasn't a bartender in sight. Not one person acknowledged our presence. We waited for 5 min before deciding to walk out.   Ended up going next door to Red Robin, and had both of our drinks and a snack delivered to us within 5 min."}
{"text":"The interior decor is pretty cool, and gives you the feeling the food will probably be good.  Ha...not quite.   I equate the food there to be the same as any Roberto's taco shop.  It lacks flavor, and authenticity.     The service was good though."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out only a few times, so I can only tell you my experience from that. Food is ok not a \"real traditional \" Mexican food restaurant. Ordered a shredded carnitas burrito and it was big and filling but they left huge chunks of pork not cool, so had to leave it to the side to eat later. Then I ordered flautas with cabbage (they had no shredded cabbage) so they gave me shredded lettuce instead. The price point is a bit steep for what you get compared to other places. Overall, it's ok that's why I gave them 3 stars!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here I felt the restaurant had too many lights on it was very bright and took away from the ambience . The music was really good by a live band. Was not too loud I ordered the shrimp Fajitas it was delicious but the shrimp were not jumbo size as it was advertised , lots of onions more than I expected.  The dessert is what I really enjoyed the fried ice cream was on fire , enough for two people. Absolutely delicious. ."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it was not as flavorful as some of the other Mexican places I have tried. Either the food needs to taste more flavorful, or the price needs to be lower."}
{"text":"My brother and I wandered into Michoacán one day for lunch when the wait at the Red Robin right next door was too long. We were seated right away and the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. The chips and bean dip were very good (but if you order a second round, they'll charge you a couple of bucks, fyi). We both ordered carne asada burritos and they were delicious. They were super stuffed with meat and it was super flavorful. Would definitely come back again to try something else!"}
{"text":"If you like good Mexican food and tasty margaritas, then this is the place for you. This place serves some of the most authentic Mexican food in town. Not only do they make fresh corn and flour tortillas, but they also offer dishes not commonly seen in other Mexican restaurants. My personal favorite is their Lengua al Tequila. They also offer table side prepared guacamole with a variety of fixings such as cilantro, jalapeños, lime, and tomatoes. For the most part, the service is highly efficient and the staff is attentive.   The only issue I have with this place is their floor setup. It's like a maze and can get pretty crammed. It can be quite irksome when they seat you at the furthest corner away from the bathroom. If you are claustrophobic, it might bother you. Their waiting area is tiny, which is annoying because if there's extremes of weather, you either cram into the small area or wait outside for a table."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic the steaks are perfect along with the authentic mexican food everything is fresh made daily.  I'm a pretty picky eater but everything was so delicious and the staff are top notch we never had to ask for anything everyone was super kind and friendly. The mole sauce was one of the best I've ever tasted if you  have not found this place yet FIND it you won't regret it.  If there were 10 star rating I would give it a 12. My new best place to eat."}
{"text":"How come when looking at the menu every item says price varies? Really? Tortillas. Price varies? Guacamole? Price varies?  Just trying to get an idea of how much money I need. Now u have run me off. Never going there"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here often. The food is very good but what sends this place over the top for us is the superior service. By now the wait staff know us by name and treat us like old friends. I'm sure the level of service we receive is observed behavior from Mark, the owner who is often wondering the restaurant, striking up friendly conversation with customers. I am happy to say the great habits of the owner, Mark, have rubbed off well to the hired staff. I can honestly say, even on days we dine there and Mark is not there, the waiters, waitresses, services, bartenders all have treated us very well. As far as the food, I have not had a bad meal. The menu is very large and there is a large selection. I personally recommend the seafood selections but if your unsure, I have always received great recommendations from the waiters."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant. Food is great. Atmosphere is nice. Wait time are usually pretty quick. They have an enclosed outdoor patio with heaters if you have a large group."}
{"text":"A delicious meal just like everytime we eat here. I'm not a burrito, taco, enchilada fan so I pass on the combo plates. I prefer the dinner plates where you choose the protein and then the sauce. There's about 5 sauces that I prefer and they never let me down. The staff are very good at matching the flavors between proteins and sauce. If I can't make up my mind,  then I go for the fajitas. Those are the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"We were here with a very large party 30+ and the food was great, the servers were so attentive and the owner made out group feel welcome"}
{"text":"Another great experience. There were seven of us and making a reservation through Yelp made the walk in possible on a Friday night. Service was on point and so where the margaritas"}
{"text":"We went Saturday night. Service by staff was exceptional.  Ordered Nachos which needed some sort of sauce. Steak strips were good. However the only other items where chips, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  Wife order a pork chimichanga it was ok. She didn't finish and we took home the rest. Today for lunch I warmed it up and found a huge piece of bone in it.  For as busy as it was and previous reviews. Hope this visit was an exception."}
{"text":"The rib eye steak was amazing!!! Love this place! Margaritas there are huge and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad!!!  I had tried this place years ago when we had a Vegan Eatz/V Animal Sanctuary dinner and.......I was not impressed.  Hubs and I were craving refried beans, some table side guac...the works.  The table side guac was yummy, I kinda wish I would have asked for more cilantro and some jalapeños (we were afraid it would be too spicy. But know we know.  Just speak up and ask for it exactly the way you want it.  Hubs got the vegan burritos they had grilled and sautéed veggies, beans with optional red sauce on top. It came with a side of refried beans. I tried it and it was very yum.  I wanted to FINALLY try a tamale. I'm not sure if I have really ever eaten a tamale? I'm not a fan of ground mushy maize. (It tastes like a wet dog smells to me for some reason.)  Well, this didn't. And it was vegan. It was full of mushrooms and garlic. You can choose either red or green sauce to go on top. It was yum. And big! One was filling to me. I got a side \"salad\" of tomatoes lettuce and onion with cilantro vinaigrette and it was too much food for me.  I really like their bean dip, salsa and chips! I can really put a hurtin' on them.  Keep in mind this is NOT health food and probably contains more oil than one should eat in a year total, but it's good Americanize Mex!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food:  Below average.  I tried the rib eye steak, lacked seasoning. My wife had the milanesa, it was crispy and slightly above average.  The fresh guacamole was also just average, not great.  The fried icecream was terrible. Nothing like stale soggy cornflakes to ruin good ice cream.  Service: Terrible. After sitting unattend for the first 6 minutes a server brought us chips, salsa, and their bean dip; he left before we could ask for drinks. Five minutes later someone came and took our drink order. About 20 minute in we got our drinks and ordered. They brought my steak without a steak knife and forgot my tortillas, but I didn't notice till the waiter stepped away. Since they were no were to be seen, I mushed through it with a butter knife.  Later in the meal they did refill our waters a few times.  As we were finishing up, they were very quick to clear away our plates.   Overall, the food is far from special.  The service was slow and unattentive. I would not recommend this place to a friend and I would never return."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and over priced. Owner needs to go to charm school. Not worth your hard earned dollars."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Food is always good. The servers are pretty good too. In the last 2 years I've only had one not-so-good experience with takeout. When I went to pick up there were two hostesses that didn't look so thrilled to be there and were a little on the rude side. Which was pretty surprising since I never had any issues before, other than that i recommend this place for anyone wanting some tasty food! :)"}
{"text":"Great food as always! Carlos and Vidal served us tonight, and those guys kept the chips and the dips coming! Mark, promote these guys! You have a great team here: make sure you throw a good Cinco de Mayo party for the team and don't let your good people go! God bless you all and the hungry patrons you serve!  -Jake the film guy"}
{"text":"VERY PLEASED WITH THIS RESTAURANT.  I'm new to L.V. and don't eat out much, but I have been here three times now. The service has been very good every time and I think the food is quite yummy. I LOVE the Fideo soup and the guacamole made table side. I'm a pescetarian, so I have never tried any \"meat\" dishes but I really enjoy the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos). They always have live music and the house margaritas are really tasty!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining here since they opened,it's always been  great up and till the last 3 time we've gone. Is this restaurant  under new owners ? Cause it seem so , last 3 times we ate here the food comes out cold  , dried out , not fresh. It's like they are pre- makeing the food and just reheating it (not made fresh to order) We  went  tonight with friends , food was terrible again. Everyone's food was  dried out and our  faita  steak  burrito was cold and dry.  It's unfortunate that a once really good resturant has gone down hill."}
{"text":"A very nice decent Mexican restaurant with decent food.   You get chips, salsa, and bean dip while you decide what you are ordering, like most Mexican places.   They have several locations around LV. I will be back, but nothing beat the Mexican food you find in Orange County, CA."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot for sure. Love the decor, it looks like little México in there.  We had a delicious chelada and bloody mary. I gotta say i have never had a hard time drinking a bloody mary before until today. Not because it wasn't good.. It was Great!! i loved that u could actually taste the vodka!!  They gave us fruit with a yummy strawberry mouse to start instead of the usual chips and salsa. I had the menudo and my husband had the chilaquiles. Both were delicious and served quick! We were also able to take advantage of the free churro dessert by checking in through yelp. The service was amazing!!! They checked on you often and everyone was very polite.  I am happy we found another great spot for mexican food."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. It was busy but our waiter did take time and get our orders correct"}
{"text":"They have excellent food. Very few Mexican restaurants serve Sol and they have it. I would highly recommend them if you in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant now. I made a reservation, came right in and my table was ready. The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"first time here. great food. we got beans with the chips and salsa. used to just gettng chips & salsa. ordered my fav - albondigas and a carnitas taco. both excellent dishes. good flavor. servers are fast and nice. great place to have dinner."}
{"text":"It has been a while since my last visit, so I am not sure if ownership changed or the cook or both, because food quality is not the same.   We came here in the past on several occasions for their Sunday Brunch and endless margaritas, and mimosas for the great price of $12.95.   However, we recently found out that their special brunch was only going to be served once a month from now on. So we made it a point to not miss this month.  I was  initially bummed that they would only have their brunch once a month but after today's experience, I'm okay if they have it once a year or never.  I mean if you are going to have a once a month brunch, make it count.  The selections were far less than I remembered, and I think they thought they could make up for it by adding 2 seafood dishes, but the seafood was completely overcooked and all the other dishes just seemed to lack flavor and authenticity.  The only dish that was decent enough for me today was their Carnitas a la Coca-Cola and for this dish alone I didn't leave hungry.  I know I always say that I won't torture myself with another makeshift Mexican Restaurant, but seriously, this place was pretty decent some time ago and I actually was looking forward to coming back here again... so disappointed and just glad we did not drag anyone else along for this experience."}
{"text":"The service is always extremely attentive, the food is served fast and is delicious.  Prices are fairly inexpensive for dinner and cheap for lunch.  Chips and salsa are bottomless and fantastic.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the service is always great and food is wonderful..  recently came and don't remember the salsa being so tomato \"pastey.\" Absolutely no chunks of anything. Watery and little taste."}
{"text":"Truly amazing food! I think this is our new favorite Mexican Restaurant (and we've been to dozens.) The service is exemplary. Food authentic. Atmosphere beautiful.  We couldn't have had a more stellar experience. Thank you to our waiter Luis."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere and awesome customer service! The fish tacos are the best!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome very friendly and attentive, always an awesome experience great food. Breakfast buffet is amazing"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time to Vegas and I was getting married. I asked the guy who works at the Men's Warehouse for a good place to eat and he suggested Lindo Michoacan.  All I have to say is, AWESOME. The spicy salsa, the great lunch portions, VERY friendly staff. I would definitely come back to eat when I go to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Again I find myself enjoying lunch at my favorite Mexican restaurant.  You will love this place.  Come for either lunch or dinner.  Will NOT disappoint. .."}
{"text":"I like to think I know good Mexican food having grown up in LA, and living in Mexico for 6 years. The menu had some good looking choices, but when the food came, every dish I tasted had WAY too much salt. Nothing else stood out enough to overcome the salt mine problem."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. They kept checking on us to make sure our drinks were never empty and to make sure the bean dip and chips were replenished. With that being said, I wish I could say the same for the food and comfort. I'm not sure why there are sooo many great reviews on the food here. Maybe I am spoiled from being raised in a Hispanic family and having authentic food? but then again, they are supposed to have \"authentic\" food. My 5 yr old wanted a chicken taco. She loves chicken. I saw her taking the chicken out, and I asked her what was wrong? she said she does not like it. Seeing that this little girl is a meat lover, we found that odd, so my wife tried the chicken and spit it out. She even showed me how it looked. It looked old and like it was microwaved. It was terrible and tasted like poultry without seasoning. My wife and I had the Carne Asada Torta, it was edible but it was nothing to make us return. The steak could have had more flavor The fideo soup had NO flavor at all. None of us finished it. The bean dip was just okay. The rice, I will admit was good. It was the best thing we had there.  Seating is very uncomfortable for a family of 5. They sat is in an area next to the door. There was a wall but it had a decorative window opening in which all the cold air kept coming in, every time the door was opened it did not close because it would get stuck. Our food was freezing cold in a matter of minutes and my kids had to eat with their coat on. ( it is December). Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to Michoacan. We will stick to Leticias."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the shrimp fajitas and they were delish! The margaritas are awesome and they make their tortillas there!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. There is always a wait but it goes quickly. Homemade guacamole is terrific."}
{"text":"Yummmmn! Bottomless margaritas with brunch, omelet station and the BEST bean dip, AMAZON.COM shrimp ceviche and top notch service. My new favorite place on earth!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place. The only problem is the serving size is so large we always have leftovers. Of course, that not really a problem as long as this is your last stop before going home."}
{"text":"Thank you to the best  staff ever! We had so much fun on May 5th! The  staff is so respectful,  family  driven and service is great thank you so much Ana b"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, and service is usually very quick. All the waitstaff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been seeing ads for this place for a long time. So I decided to finally come in. So disappointed!!! Leticia's Mexican Cocina is SO MUCH BETTER!!! The sauce for the chips and salsa that they offer complimentary taste like canned tomato sauce with a jalapeño chopped into it. Disgusting! The chimichanga was so dry. This is the kind of restaurant that makes me realize the importance of cooking at home. The only authentic Mexican print of this place is the music. Save yourself $60 and go elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Another place found by luck. The food is more varied and the flavors more textured than the standard franchise restaurant. Nothing was dry or overcooked, the meats were tender. It can feel crowded at peak dinner hour, so I recommend going early or later. Friday nights can get noisy since the bar is jammed up to the dining area; you can ask to be seated in the rear area."}
{"text":"Small intimate space, authentic cuisine, Full bar, good service and fair prices. My preference is queso fresco not the mild cheddar that was on my enchiladas. Shrimp on my salad was a little on the small side, but very tasty. Spicy ranch dressing was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! Trust me it is so good you will think my mom made it! Not all Michoacán restaurants are the same! This one is the best and I have tried them all! The gringo still owns this one... the quality,service and portions are the best here! I am pretty sure they changed the chips... and if he was here today ... I would have mentioned it to him... but it's still the best Mexican restaurant EVER!!"}
{"text":"We.  Decided to try Michoacán based on the Yelp reviews that we read. We arrived at approximately 7 pm and although they were very busy we managed to be seated by a friendly hostess with just a few minutes.  We started with chips and salsa which came with an incredible bean dip. We also ordered guacamole which was prepared table side. They use 2 guacamole's and quite a bit of pics de gallo and onions which makes for a huge dish of phenomenal guacamole. My friend was full after the chips but I had to try the al Pastor. The al Pastor at Michoacán rates up there with the absolute best that I have ever tasted inside or outside of Mexico! Three tacos packed with al pastor, shredded lettuce and cheese. The tacos were accompanied by the usual Spanish rice and retried beans. Good sides but they can't stand up to the rest of the food that we ate.  Service is very friendly. The establishment is clean and well taken care of. Our food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. You can't ask for more at a local Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great! Try to get a reservation if you can help it. Their tortillas alone are worth a trip. They have a little window where you can see them making it from scratch. Service is good and the atmosphere is great. The bathrooms are OK."}
{"text":"Enjoyed thus place. Delicious authentic Mexican food and great customer service! If you're looking for a great place to dine and a decent price, this is the spot. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Came for the buffet. I have to say I'm dissatisfied. So they are serving quesadillas and taqitos with no sour cream, guac , or dipping sauces. They were extremely dry , so sour cream and guac should be in this buffet for 16 bucks. They should also serve you fresh tortillas because they were very hard out of the metal basket. The beef fajitas I had were very dry and tasteless. The desserts are store bought cheap brownies and generic cookies. I have come here many times for dinner, but this buffet could be so much better if they just added a few things and made slight changes.  I hate waking out of here paying 20 bucks for a dissatisfied meal. The employees are amazing, and I know the management cares about customers complaints. Man, it hurts to write this review , but I have to be honest. Go for the fresh food in the kitchen , stay away from the bland dry food at the buffet. Urghhh... I was so looking forward to this"}
{"text":"Just went today and it was awesome! The moment we sat, the gentlemen came with the chips and dip, followed by our waiter asking what we would like to drink, and mind you the place was packed so they don't use \"the we are busy\" excuse. The food was hot and delicious, but what made this place stand out was the workers. Our drinks were always full, and one worker overheard me tell my mom that I'm full and he right away asked if I needed a to-go box. Awesome place. Oh, if you want dessert, try the fried ice cream. It was sooooo good! :)"}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican restaurant in the Northwest! Great service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a saturday and I was pleased to find it was not very busy. We were seated immediatly and was also given chips with beans and salsa right away. They got our drinks over and took our order with 5 minutes. The service was great throughout the entire visit.   Here is the thing, it wasent that great. It was not bad food at all, it was just really average. The food was comprable to any taqueria but for much more money.  The resteraunt was clean with some cool knick nacks on the wall and they had the had the game on but the table was super wobbly which kind of annoyed me.   If you are intrested in this place then try it. Everyone has different tastes and the great service here warrents at least a try."}
{"text":"I always get their enchiladas with green sauce and it is pretty good.  I also like their salsa and bean dip and it is complimentary =].  What makes me a repeated customer here is the tortillas!  They have a tortilla lady who makes it fresh and you can watch her make it too."}
{"text":"I really like this place, nice restaurant, great food, great people, but this last visit the service was slow.  Good, but slow... What's up??"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service is perhaps the best I have gotten anywhere. The wait staff is very attentive. When I finished my first glass of tea, the glass barely hit the table before someone was picking it up to refill. Same thing when the check was brought to the table."}
{"text":"we have only been here for lunch times, but it has always been delicious, gr8 happy hr specials....good atmosphere, good food, nice staff"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of mexican food.  I grew up in San Diego and mostly just called mexican food, \"food\"  we had it so much.  Im pretty tolerant of different interpretations of it and all that being said this place has bad food.   Heres the thing though it wasn't so much that it wasn't very flavorful (it really was sorta bland) it was the the 4 tablespoons of water on the plate that sogged the taco to where it fell apart when picked up.  It wasn't the coalgluted cheeses on the the chicken enchilada in tomatillo sauce not being melted enough and just pooled on the side of the enchilada like white cement, or the fact the whole plate seemed to have been tossed together in like 3 minutes put under a broiler (not even long enough to melt the cheese).  And then brought out for me to try and eat.  It came with a chile reano that was actually pretty good but the rancho sauce or salsa it was served with was broken.  maybe thats where all the extra water on the plate came from.  Olives and lima beans in the rice?   I know every places rice is different, however this was also dry and crisp indicating it was old and had been sitting out.  The beans were ok.  Service was great and i felt bad telling the waiter i was unhappy when he asked.  I showed him how the water pooled up on the plate (again where did all this water on the plate come from?) and that the shredded beef taco was chicken and a soggy mess with no crispness at all from sitting in the plate water.   it was awful, so soggy I couldn't even pick it up before it exploded on the plate.  Disappointed. As the wife and I had wanted to eat here a long time.  Don't understand how this place has gotten anything in the way of good reviews.  maybe it was an off night.  but the kitchen should have never let that plate go out like that.  that they did indicates to me no one at the pass and it must be the status quo.  I would avoid this place, robertos does a better job.  Seriously..Robertos.  never again."}
{"text":"Super amazing stuff and the food is truly amazing they are pretty funny for a birthday request love it love it love it can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Great brunch good margaritas what else can i ask for!  Fresh food and margaritas"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. I probably won't be back since it's so far North, but the price makes it worth a visit for unlimited margaritas and mimosas. The food was ok, but it was so cramped and hard to get food it became annoying and I didn't bother getting up for another plate. Service was ok, but started slow. We needed more direction to know where buffet was etc. Try to avoid the booths at all costs and you'll have a more comfortable meal."}
{"text":"Boo! Went for the Sunday brunch buffet and for about $15/pp I was.disappointed. Sure they offer unlimited margaritas and mimosas with ur meal but even that couldn't get me to come back. The \"buffet\" was small and had items such as Salad with various dressings Taquitos Beef fajitas Chile Verde Ceviche Guacamole Pozole or menudo (can't remember which) Fruit Sweet bread Whipped cream Bacon Potato hash And a few other items  First nothing was fresh and second nothing was hot. Most things were warm-ish like the taquitos. Who wants a cold taquito? The beef fajitas were swimming in oil..The Chile Verde was decent it wasnt hot but it was warm enough to at least taste ok. I mostly filled up on the chips and salsa they bring to your table when u first sit down. They come with a mild salsa and bean dip which is pretty tasty and I got a big bowl of guacamole from the buffet to dip the chips into as well. I also had some Mexican sweet bread with some whip cream and it was probably the best thing I ate. I did order a mimosa which was standard nothing special buy it was nice that it was included.  The only other thing to mention was the little glass room right in the middle of the restaurant thats attached to the kitchen....an older lady was in there making homemade tortillas and it was pretty cool to watch. At least we know something is fresh there!"}
{"text":"Server we had seemed overwhelmed. Waited 15 minutes for our waiter to greet and take our order. The menu could be more detailed and not figuring out what the hell it is if you don't read spanish. The food itself was ok, but I would go to on the border instead."}
{"text":"LOVE This place great lunch specials ! ! ! ! ! !  The NEW STREET TACOS Are Amazing, Very authentic And I know I lived In MEXICO for 17 years ! ! ! ! ! ! !"}
{"text":"Bad service then the waiters can care less if you came to the restaurant expensive and small portions not even a child would get full."}
{"text":"Great food!! We had our rehearsal dinner here and I was really impressed by how quickly they got our food out to us. With 21 people they got all of the orders right and stayed on top of all of our drinks. I was really happy with how everything turned out."}
{"text":"This is an excellent mexican restaurant!  It's clean and has a great ambiance.  The food is excellent and the service superb.  The only thing I didn't like was their thin house soup but the other people in our party liked it so it was probably just me.  We signed up for their e-mail list and they have done a good job keeping in touch with us.  Letting us know about entertainers that will be there and special brunches etc.  Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and friendly. Bathrooms could be kept up better.  Will be back to eat and stuff my tummy with more of those wonderful NY cut steaks!!!!"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED and the food was NOT GOOD. I'd rather go to Leticia's than this place! Sorry!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. You get a lot so the price is understandable. I wasn't a fan of the seasoning in the fajitas nor the fact that it was tenderized, shredded meat (I prefer chopped carne asada); but that doesn't mean it was bad...I've just had better. The elotes were delicious! Super tiny waiting area; be ready to wait outside in the heat. All in all, a good place to eat, but nothing that stands out enough to give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sad excuse to be called a Mexican restaurant.  Ate lunch there the other day and ordered a torta de carne asada  took forever, no flavor at all, not ever going back.  The chips and dip see the only thing good.  I'm from Chicago and I'm considered a Mexican food expert. And this place is American Mexican food. And not what real Mexican food taste like. Too expensive an not authentic at all."}
{"text":"New to Vegas we heard this was the Best Mexican food in town, we were very disappointed. Atmosphere Excellent, Service Excellent Food....horrible. My parents were in town and wanted to hear some Mariachi's so this is why we went.  We will never go back. Talking to other locals it may just be this location. So if you are doing to try them don't go here!"}
{"text":"If you need a party or big event catered I highly recommend Michoacan Restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious it arrived hot and right on time and there was so much of it!  From the first phone call I was put at ease and was not disappointed.  We had the fajitas and everything came with it the beans and rice and guacamole all of it was fresh and good. We Thank You Michoacan for making our party a success!!!"}
{"text":"Food was average, service was a little dumb, maybe the language barrier, prolly not. trans-freindly: a-ok"}
{"text":"The food at Michoacán is very good. As with any restaurant, the food is made to order. My favorite meal is, Two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans, ummm so good! And pairing the meal with a marijuana, or two, or three, is really good. I'm a regular customer of Michoacán and recommend it as a place for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Experience tonight was mediocre at best. Cadillac margaritas  worse than most house margaritas. Never did get our salsa and beans with dinner. Dried out pork and chicken. Burnt jalapeño poppers. Had to ask for more water and chips. Unsociable waiter as well.  Will not be back to bad was one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is small but you can usually sit on the patio.  Nice servers and yummy margaritas! My husband got a steak with an amazing cilantro sauce - definitely recommend this place.  Bonus: kids eat free Mondays"}
{"text":"just really disappointing. chips are horrible (couldnt eat them) the entrees were barely average. the margaritas tasted like a bottled mix. and the service was super slow. yeah ill give 1 pity star to you"}
{"text":"We went to this place the first day that it opened and were blown away.  With a deep love for great mexican food and having had authentic home cooked mexican, that was saying alot.   2 weeks later, it was like a microwave dinner, and we have not been back.  Horrible turn for the worse."}
{"text":"We decided to finally try what seems to be Vegas' favorite Mexican place on a Friday after work.  Lindo was already hoppin' at 6:30, but we seemed to beat the crowd and only had a 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated at a table in the bar area - between the bar stools and the massive booths they have.  (To be honest the booths look plush and wonderful, but are so large they seem out of scale with this rather small restaurant).  The service was warm and attentive throughout.  Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip? Check.  All were good - the salsa even a bit hotter than what I expected, which made for an auspicious start!  House margaritas on the rocks with salt made with sweet and sour and Sauza were bright, tangy and not overly sweet - yummy.  Wow - their menu is extensive with all kinds of innovative, tasty sounding dishes like Fillet Relleno -  fish fillet stuffed with seafood and then breaded and fried.  I opted for the Enchiladas de Camaron - gulf shrimp in tortillas with red enchilada sauce.  The combination includes fideo soup - although it's just a simple tomato based soup with vermicelli noodles, I'm a big fan of any restaurant that serves it.  Love me some fideo and this one was good.  The entrees arrived and, after such an exciting stellar start, I was surprised they were a little...well...meh.  The shrimp were cooked nicely inside my enchiladas, but the sauce was kind of tasteless.  Rice and beans were fine, pretty much what you would expect to find in any mexican restaurant.  My whole entree was kind of a plate of bland.  That said, I definitely want to go back - I haven't lost faith, maybe I just didn't make the right choice off of their massive menu.  Mole anyone?"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least once a week and tonight they completely messed everything up. We got here at 7pm, waited to be seated and we got seated at 7:30pm. We ordered food and we waited till 8:45 and no food came. All we got was our drinks and chips. I had to ask for the soup because they didn't even bring it to us. So I ask the waiter about where our food was.. He said their thermal printer ran out of paper so they put a new roll in and our food will be out in 5 mins. We couldn't wait any longer because our friend had to go to work. My question is that if the printer was out of paper then why did everyone around us that got there after Us got their food?  If the waiter would've just kept up and realized we haven't gotten our food in 20-30 mins he should've known something was wrong. The problem is, they messed up.. And now they will lose a good customer. Like I said, my husband and I eat there at least once a week. Looks like we will be taking our business elsewhere . We got up and left, after waiting for over an hour for our food. I told the manager and he acted like he didn't even know anything and didn't care. The waiter should've told the manager what happened and the manager could've at least came to our table and apologize. We got nothing.  If I could give this place negative 100 stars right now I could. Not only we left with empty starving stomachs but we also left feeling like this place didn't give two sh*ts about customer service."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in north west las Vegas.... they serve fideo soup prior to your meal which is yummy and the waiters and waitresses are so attentive....."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this place I ordered the Chilaquiles with 2 eggs and a carne asada steak not did they not give me the carne asada steak but they were Gross they  tasted like the red sauce was from a can! Very disappointed... Also in the middle of our meal we had a server asked us if we needed boxes to go I felt rushed after that"}
{"text":"My fav elote in Las Vegas! Good happy hour and even better margaritas :) service is always fantastic and courteous."}
{"text":"This has become my new found place to get fajitas.  Service is out of this world. They are always smiling and helpful. Oh and don't forget fast. The food is on a whole different lvl. Its beyond yummy."}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service!!  The food was delicious. I got the milanesa and my husband got the shrimp fajitas. They never missed a refill, they were quick with little things like asking for hot sauce. The staff knew the menu and were able to recommend. We didn't check it for our free dessert because we were stuffed! But the waiter let us know that we can save it for next time. Our table was always cleaned. There was never a clutter. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Horribly disappointing. The Janitzio was pretty tasteless- The beef taco was burnt and the enchilada was practically empty. Choose your own margaritas were missing triple sec which is a staple for margarita making. The server was short with his interaction and appeared bothered. Is the tequila watered down? Because after consuming two, might I add I choose Anejo tequilas, my buzz was practically non-existent and should've been much stronger. Ugh. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in hoping to have a fresh cold salad on this hot LV day.   On their daily specials menu,SALAD: lettuce, sliced tomato, avocado and cheese with choice of dressing $12.  Are you serious?  Been coming here for years - what a bunch of crap!  Adios! Time for a new MX restaurant."}
{"text":"Searching for good mexican food is Vegas is not easy.  Every place, even the ones that use the word \"authentic\" are just americanized eateries that have the usual mexican dishes.  Lindo Michoacan is no different.  I agree with most of the posts.  The salsa is plain and way too much tomato sauce and no tomatoes, onions or cilantro.  The beans served with the salsa was as you would expect.  The best part was our shrimp dish.  The shrimp tasted like- SHRIMP.  We found that amazing.  Our server was great.  The house margaritas seemed watered down and we had a pitchers worth of them.  This is probably more a personal thing but I found a spelling error in the dessert menu, they used the word CARMEL meaning CARAMEL.  I pointed it out to our server and then tried to reach the overall manager for the chain, Gerardo at the number listed on the website.  He was too busy to take my call so I wrote to them via the supplied email address.  Three days later no email or call.  This indicates a real lack of concern and a lack of customer service that I expect where ever I eat. I would think they would be very appreciative of someone who spotted this mistake so they could correct it.  Now that I see how they ignored me, I am doubting they care or will ever correct it.  Overall the food was average to good.  The service was great, the atmosphere was typical mexican restaurant.  I really wish they would improve the salsa and margaritas and learn how to spell."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place to eat! Love there food and customer service. Very friendly and super attentive. I love there chips with beans and salsa."}
{"text":"My son wanted to go here and it was his turn to pick the restaurant. We have been here before and have enjoyed our meals. This time we were seated right away and the chips and beans and salsa were brought to the table within 30 seconds of sitting. Drink orders were placed and we were looking over the vast menu having a hard time deciding. When my waiter came over I told him I was having trouble deciding and I told him I like pork. He recommended the Carnitas. It was marinated pork in fresh orange juice and spices. It was great. Everyone in the family had a good time with wonderful food. It's just what you want when you go to a restaurant. The waiter service was topnotch. They never let a glass go empty. Very prompt with everything. Far and away the BEST Mexican food in the northwest. Yes I said it!! Go see for yourself, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say we're \"regulars\" here but we are locals and if we decide to go to Lindo Michoacan we come to this location. The food was great as always. The service was fantastic; Jen at the bar was so nice and she always gives top of the line service. The one thing that bothered me right down to the core was the manager on duty the night of 3/20. My boyfriend and I were definitely not the last people on the restaurant. Actually one gentleman and a couple walked in about 15 minutes after us. It was getting close to closing time and we were being mindful of the time because we would never want to keep a business open longer than needed but the manager was telling Jen to have us wrap it up and to have her leave early. We were gambling and the guy next to us JUST got his food; kind of a ridiculous request to me. This was about 40 minutes till close also. Then 10 minutes later he comes back and tells Jen to let us know last call. REALLY????? With 30 minutes, a couple still eating in the dining room bar area and a guy still eating at the bar you're going to say last call and rush us and your bartender out of the restaurant. I was completely offended by his actions. My boyfriend and I are late night eaters and if he's going to be the new manager at night we definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a favorite stop when we visit family in Las Vegas. The food is authentic Mexican cuisine. The fideo soup is a perfect start to a nice dinner that makes you feel right at home. The only issue we have had is the portions are very large. We ordered Ala carte this time which was perfect. We got the two fideo soups, a taco, an enchilada, and guacamole.  With the chips and salsa along with two margaritas we were totally satisfied.   The food, service, and atmosphere make this one of our favorite Resturant's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First, the beans are fresh. Fresh pinto beans are usually soaked in a clay pot. These have that taste to compliment the chips and salsa that had just the right kick.  I had the filete relleno. It is a white fish battered, fried and stuff with seafood like shrimp, octopus, etc. It is topped with a zesty mayo sauce that is flavorful and has a hard, slicy punch. The dish is served with more pinto beans, Spanish rice, and guacamole on top of rice. Everhthing tasted fresh except for the dry Spanish rice. It looked like they had put a can of mixed vegetables in it as well. Who wants peas in their Spanish rice?! Overall, the dish is pricy but worth it.   Their tortillas are authentic and well made. I have been taught how to make tortillas and these exhibit all the necessarily attributes.   For dessert try their churros. The cinnamon sugar, caramel sauce and whip cream are heavenly. Yes, that was the Yelp coupon they offered."}
{"text":"I've been to all of the chains for Lindo and I can honestly say that this has been the worst. The plate that I usually get which is El Gallo al coñac had no flavor at all. I also ordered a margarita which tasted more like a lemonade. I can honestly say that it was a pretty bad experience."}
{"text":"Love this place for Mexican food, the food is very good and authentic.  They bring the best bean dip and salsa for the homemade chips, good stuff, right there!  The service was superior and the staff friendly and welcoming. The manager came around to ask how our meal was and checked on us a couple times.  The fajitas were tender and marinated just right.  The chimichanga was crunchy and very tasty, reminiscent of true Mexico.  I tried both the location in Henderson, that location has a spectacular view of the entire valley, would love to go back at night.  Also the Centennial location, a bit smaller but the food and décor was just a nice.  I'll add this place to my list of favorite Mexican places.  Ole!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Reasonable prices and great service!"}
{"text":"First visit here because one of the other Mexican food spots was closed for the Superbowl. Parking was easy, the interior and the culture of the inside is so beautiful, staff and faculty are quite accommodating, but the prices for the quality of food was not up to par. Because of the buffet special our wee party of three opted for the Sunday Brunch Buffet for $15.95 per adult.  Quality of food was not as warm as we'd hoped, the flour tortillas were burned, and a lot of the food served was pretty dry. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of low quality food, therefore the low quality rating."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Every location is fantastic and the staff is always kind and overwhelmingly accommodating. I come here with my 94 year old grandmother who has a walker - they make sure we are very comfortable. Good food always and they bring complimentary soup and refried beans with chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I had a date at Lindo Michoacan on NYE, even against the warnings of some friends who said the Centennial location isn't as good as the other Michoacan restaurants in town. The way I looked at it, if the date was going well, we probably wouldn't be paying much attention to our meals anyway! We were tended to in a very friendly manner, the entire time. I was señorita'd a handful of times which always makes me giggle on the inside. I'm not a burrito kinda girl but my date's grande burrito looked delicious! &, well, grande. I made sure to be as generic as possible & got the chicken enchiladas combo plate. The rice had alot of potential but it was crunchy, I had a couple bites of the beans which were good, the enchiladas could've been saucier but the chicken was seriously so darn juicy & flavorful, I ended up picking thru most of the tortilla & going straight for the pollo! I so wished I could've eaten the 2nd enchilada. But!, here's what really impressed me... Knowing it was NYE, I called earlier in the day to check how late they'd be open (I saw alot of places were closing at 8 & 9) & was told they'd be closing at 10. My date & I are talking & talking & talking & it hits me that the place is QUIET. We look around & see we are literally the only people left so I check the time... it was 10:40! We thought it was awfully kind that not a single person did so much as hover to indicate it was time to get the hell out... 40 minutes ago! That sort of thing goes a long way for me. Overall, I'd definitely go back (not overstaying my welcome!) & recommend to others."}
{"text":"Been here many times,We  always get great customer service, we had Carlos as a server  twice and he has  always provide great customer service. The busser Vidal was also great,he was refilling our drinks and cleaning our tables great food, great customer service!"}
{"text":"Jade's UYE Sunday Brunch/Game Day was a wonderful opportunity to see the Yelperazzi, some I haven't seen since Nerdy Dancing 2! Due to a prior commitment, I arrived late (and several rounds of Margaritas) into the meal. Somehow I missed that it was a buffet: but I was so happy to be there, phobias did not take over.   Seated next to the lovely Sylvia Q, I quickly grabbed Shrimp Ceviche, Huevos, beans & rice, a homemade tortilla and a bowl of guacamole with fixins and a spoon. I do not kid when saying eating guac with a spoon is normal for me. Our super amazing waiter Kyle kept the drinks flowing: I tried a frozen Mango Margarita, and a sip of Sylvia's Midori but he gladly switched it out for one on the rocks. Our table looked like a Margarita rainbow! The food offerings included menudo and lots of carnivore food that I don't eat, but it looked good. Safe to say pescetarians & vegetarians who eat eggs can leave sated. I'm not a chips and salsa person, but they, too were plentiful.   This was a bargain at $13.95 per person AYCE & AYCD including ALL margarita varities and mimosas. The service was on point even though the back room we were in was shared with a second large party. Water glasses were replenished; they even had a mini mariachi group complete with sombrereo, churros, candles and a large tequilla shot because Kyle overheard it was Jieun's birthday. Now THAT'S lovely. Not too far at all from Summahood to take advantage of good food, atmosphere and service for Sunday brunch (the menu changes weekly)  Many thanks to the always incredible Jade W for hosting and inviting us all to an epic game afternoon at her home later. Great times made better by even greater company.    Yelp 100 Challenge"}
{"text":"I'm here at least twice a month for business lunches. Great atmosphere and the food is excellent. Pollo con rajas y crema, insane!"}
{"text":"Gross food. Extremely long wait. Waited over 40 minutes to get 2 disgusting and cold \"veggie burritos\" with even colder refried beans. Never again will I go back. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Do not order from Lindo online!  The website directs you to their third party provider called \"Chow Now.\"  I made my order which was charged to my credit card. I received an email saying my order was accepted. I then immediately received another email that said my order has been cancelled by Lindo and it will take 3 days to a week to refund my money. We called Lindo and they stated they cancelled the order because they are not accepting online orders! Now I have a $46 dollar debit that may or may not be refunded.  Lindo referred me to their, and I repeat THEIR third party provider for a refund. This practice is extremely unprofessional.  Lindo should cancel the ability to order online if they aren't going to accept online orders!"}
{"text":"Just realizing our disappointment by taking my sister and her family from out of town and spending over $150 on a terrible meal this is not Lindo Michoacan.  We haven't been to this location in a few years, and didn't realize this."}
{"text":"We have been a fan of the Michoacan brand of  restaurants for years.  We have visited all of them at one point or another and many times for a special occasions like birthday's.  I cannot count how many time I have been called ponchito. Everything is fresh and delicious.  I always go for a combination plate because I can never decide on just one thing so I decided to eat three.  The fresh guacamole made table side is a must have.    The service is always top notch. Everyone is very attentive to the guests needs weather it be a refill of water or chips and salsa.  If you cannot decide on what to get ask a server and they will make a recommendation you will not be disappointed with.    These guys are locally owned and operated so be sure to go out and support them.  Sunday they do a brunch with 30 plus items that always look delicious.  I will have to try that one day soon.  Sometimes during the week they have a man playing a piano and singing which can add a nice vibe to your delicious meal."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent prices, and excellent service and ambiance.  I got the vegetarian enchiladas which came with the entree, tortilla chips, beans and rice, little corn flour tortilas, fideo soup, and what was either a spicy sauce or salsa (not too experienced with Mexican food, so I couldn't tell if they forgot to give me salsa or if that was it).    The fideo soup was really good, kind of like a Mexican version of ramen noodles (I mean the real Asian kind, not the stuff college students eat).  I thought the amount of food was good for the price I paid.  I filled up so much on the rice and bean tortillas that I didn't finish the entree in one sitting.   The only complaint I have was the veggies in the veggie enchilada could have been more diverse.  It was mostly carrots and squash.  I would have liked to see some more cheese in it also.    They didn't wow me, but I would come back when I'm in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"This place is way far away but to meet some quality people I made the drive! I love mexican food, I've been to quite a few parties where the families have cooked and its some amazing food.  So I come to this place and after the rave reviews expected a lot.   The atmosphere is quaint and nice, and the service is spectacular.  It also probably helped they weren't that busy.  The chips and salsa were good, not overly salty and as usual addictive.  I ordered the tacos, they only had hard shells and the shell was overly greasy and fell apart immediately.  i ended up eating it like an open faced sandwich.  My friends got burritos and meat dishes and they looked pretty good, and i usually love fajitas so maybe I'll give it a second chance should I be up that way again.   I did like that now they have outdoor seating and there is a lot of other nice places nearby."}
{"text":"Review is based on my first and last online order. I've been coming here for years so I was excited to see they now offered online ordering. It's been over 40 minutes and counting waiting for 2 bowls of soup that should have been ready 30 min ago. Will not order online again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an \"off night\" but the food was not appetizing at all. To start, it took them just about 10 minutes before we even saw our server. I can say that our server was polite and prior to his arrival we received chips and salsa almost immediately but we were dying for drinks. When our food arrived (I ordered the rice with two pork tamales) a sizeable portion of the rice was covered in succotash (which was not good at all) and my wife's burrito also had a large portion of succotash in it. My tamales were crumbly and had little meat inside and pretty bland in taste. We've dined here in the past and had great experiences with our meals so I'm not sure what happened on this last visit. I will say that the staff is very friendly but I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Drinks were great. Food was bland, no spice or heat to anything and over priced for what we ordered. We were shocked because the place was packed."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!  All of the servers are very attentive and remember you when you come in.  They are fast, decor is authentic, not too loud, good food and excellent salsa and bean dip with chips as soon as you sit down.  They're table side guacamole is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Man, I don't know what to tell you. Except this is my most favorite restaurant for mexican food. The restaurant is always clean, customer service is always great and the food is always done right. I have been to so many restaurants and Michoacan is by far the best. My ultimate favorite is embarrassing... it is their chips, salsa and bean dip. Gotta have like 3 refills. Hahaha. There is nothing on their menu that you will be disappointed, I tried EVERYTHING. So I recommend you try this place, if you have a bad experience it's probably because there are having a bad day. Been coming here for over 20 years and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"They serve beef tongue (lengua) and chivas (goat) need I say more!  I love this place.  They lose a star because from the taste and texture; I think they buy their chips instead of make them on site."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are deliciously fresh. Guacamole and cheese are plentiful on tostados and tacos. Everything has excellent flavor!  Wait staff and restaurant are nice."}
{"text":"The food was average to be honest. I saw a few people talk about how good their salsa was... Really? Tomato  Paste salsa????  Little pricey too. I have had worse but I have also had better. Took my family for dinner and had to break the piggy bank. I had something simple like a tostada.. Again nothing to write home about. I saw their Sunday buffet table and was dissapointed.  Service was slow.... I did like the beans and salsa with the chips until I tasted what they called Salsa.. I made better salsa last night at home. Like I said tomato paste has no business in salsa!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been to! I could of made better food in my house with the privilege of not dealing with horrible servers. Our server probably said two words the entire time, otherwise he would just stand there. Our drinks were not refilled. We were never asked how the food was, which was bad! I will not be coming back due to the service, food, and outrages prices."}
{"text":"This place wasn't that bad and the people were really nice. The tortillas with avocado I ordered were a bit soggy so I didn't enjoy that. But everything else was great. Good staff"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food. This is not the same as Lindo Michoacan's although it has many similarities.  Do not go."}
{"text":"My second time here and with the same gaggle o'boys! And I would happily return.   The service here is AMAZING!! The entire staff is so attentive, and enjoyable!  The staff really makes this place above average! The outdoor patio is awesome!  The first time I was here was during the day, and I have to say oddly enough the food was actually much better. Maybe the day chef is more experienced? Or it was slower? Not sure, but we were all in agreement that.  The second time we went was for dinner, and it was busy! The food was still great, but not as perfect as the first time. Everyones dinner was a bit off. Meat cooked a tiny bit too long, some things hot, others only warm. And the $14 drinks was a bit of a shocker! Over all we had a great time.  Taking into account the pros and cons, I would go back."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Las Vegas, the one thing that ALWAYS stands out for me is the Owners take the time and come around and say Hi and check to make sure everything is going well. Makes it feel like they know me. The soup is yummy and all their dishes have been perfectly. Birthdays are also fun for a quick shot if thats your thing. Great place to stop with friends and family."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and can't say I'm blown away.  It's expensive and not up to expectations.  I will say the service is outstanding, I mean they are seriously on it.  I use to live in LA so I know some good mexican and this place doesn't quite cut it.  I probably won't be going back.  Very AVERAGE in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! They even had a car that took us back to our hotel on the strip after dinner!"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican food in the area. Great place with a wonderful atmosphere. I love it here. Beautiful patio and a wonderful Sunday brunch. The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I realize now that I've never had great Mexican food after eating here.  this restaurant is outstanding! Great food and excellent service. We ate here two nights in a rowland didn't scratch the menu's surface. bar available and take out. If you want excellent Mexcian food and not Americanized crap, eat here. It is my new fave!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly, this review receives one star only because the food was very good. That concludes the good. Now with the rest:  After being seated, we did receive our chips and salsa (which the salsa and bean dip were very sparse). After approximately 20 minutes and no server was in sight, we asked the busser if she could locate the server. No water, no drinks, no more chips and salsa. Nada. After 10 more minutes the server finally came and took our order. Fajitas for two and kids chicken fingers for our son, and drink orders finally placed as well. 10 minutes later, the dinner salad came out, but still no drinks. We finally received our drinks several minutes later. Service at this location was awful to say the least.   The server NEVER returned to check on us, refill drinks or anything else. It was as poor service as I have ever experienced. We waited nearly 20 more minutes after we were done with the meal in order to get the check. We asked the busser for to-go boxes, in which she brought one back and literally threw it on the table into the leftovers. That was the final straw. We asked for the manager. When all was explained to him, the manager seemed much less than interested in the issues. He offered no apologies, only dessert.  We asked for the check, and still we waited. Another 5-6 minutes and we had enough. We approached the reception desk and demanded the check at this point.  I can honestly say this will be the last and only visit to this location."}
{"text":"The bomb! Been here multiple times and haven't had a bad experience yet. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place. Me.... meh... A little better than most Mexican food restaurants in Vegas, but nothing really spectacular. I give them 4 stars based on their impressive stash of tequila!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor are fantastic here. Employees are attentive and friendly but can seem a little cocky. Chips are served in a huge bowl and are really hard to stop eating. Salsa and bean dip were tasty. We ordered: bowl of tortilla soup (very good), chipotle caesar salad with grilled shrimp (didn't taste anything caesar or chipotle about it, the shrimp were medium size & although plentiful, they were overcooked and not cleaned well which totally killed it for me), veggie aguacate tacos with rice & beans (only ate one taco & it was good with some help from the salsa). Happy hour was on so we ordered some bottled blue moon and bud light at $2.50 & $3.00 a bottle. Food took over 30 minutes to be served & I've had much better Mexican food for less money and will not be back here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas, been going here since it opened.  Best customer service, even better at night time dining. Been traveling to many places and Lindo has the best salsa/ bean dip with chips.   Customer service is superb, we recently moved out of vegas to Alaska and come back to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was not pleased on this is the fish I had was kind of dry I like the other place they have on Desert Inn."}
{"text":"when I'm craving a chelada, chips and salsa with some fideo soup prior to my meal I pick this place, great service and great food. you can see the ladies making tortillas  through a glass window like in old town san diego. I've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't found a flaw."}
{"text":"Disgrace to Mexican food! Chili relleno was horrid. One of the buss boys brought me soup and spilled it everywhere then dropped all the churros for the party seated behind mine. He must've been under the influence of something, most likely stoned. My waiter was filling my beverage and it seemed like he got more on the table and my seat rather than my cup. Wouldn't recommend this establishment to my worst enemy. 1/5"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just bland and bad.  Between a chicken taco, beef enchilada, and a verde pork n bean burrito I couldn't eat any of it.   Hopefully my free churro makes up for it all, at least I have plenty of room for dessert!"}
{"text":"WOW! What an amazing place! We didn't even know this gem was up here - it was hidden!!   The food, the service and the price were all amazing! Our glasses were never empty and we never felt rushed to finish our appetizers before our soups and meals came out.  Everything was cooked to perfection - and the portions are plenty!!!!  The restaurant is clean and no booth sat full of dirty plates etc for more than a minute.  I am so happy we found this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not a good value at all. We were seated relatively fast and it was packed during Father's Day. The food came quickly enough for us not to worry about it. I ordered a burrito but did not come with a side of anything. The burrito was ok, but I feel like I could have had a better burrito at a local taco shop. For the price we paid it did not feel worth it. Not coming back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the flavors are wonderful; no  Tex-Mex here. Regular menu is awesome, just finish the breakfast buffet and it was Excellent. Food is very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I was recently given a 50$ giftcard for this place and was eager to try it out. I had always seen it when I would visit red robin but never got around to trying it.  Like others have mentioned, the decor is amazing. I came with my girlfriend and upon being seated, I immediately noticed that this place looked very clean and was well embellished.    It's quite small, but still a nice little antiquated Mexican restaurant.   As soon as we were seated we were given chips with salsa and bean dip. The salsa, like many people have stated, was subpar. Tasted like Campbell's tomato soup. However, the bean dip was excellent. For the main course I got the Dijon mustard grilled chicken, which was pretty average. My girlfriend got the combo that came with a chicken enchilada, beef taco, and a tostada, which were all pretty average, except for the enchilada which wasn't that good because the chicken was slightly lukewarm and the flavor was lacking. However, the true masterpiece of this place, is their tortillas. So soft and warm. They are the best tortillas I've ever had in my life! But I can't rate this place on the tortillas alone. So the overall score is 3 out of 5 stars. Because everything was pretty average.  P.S try the horchata, it's really good."}
{"text":"Fun and colorful decor. Friendly and attentive staff. Great handmade tortillas, and the food is pretty tasty too. Has been very busy every time we have been (4 times since moving to the northwest side of town roughly 9 months ago), but the staff are still attentive, and the food is still good."}
{"text":"Ate there twice really good food haven't tried the buffet yet but definitely look forward to eating there again ..."}
{"text":"My favorite!!! The ONLY Mexican restaurant in all of Las Vegas that we love. The food is great but the staff is like no other! Bartenders are always always always consistent. I seriously can't say enough about this place"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  I've been here once before a few years ago and I definitely had the same experience.  Staff was super friendly and helpful with menu suggestions, the live music was cheesy yet awesome, place was clean, service fast, food delicious!  The chips, bean dip and salsa hold you over until you get your food.  I ordered the three chicken tacos and it came with Fideo soup to start, Mexican rice and beans.  My wife ordered the Novillo Al Conac which was steak with a reduced mushroom sauce, Mexican rice, beans and tortilla.  She loved it!  For an appetizer we had some awesome Ceviche Camaron.  Not too wet, not to dry, plenty of shrimp and very tasty.  For dessert, we got the Lindo Flameado (fried ice cream surrounded by banana slices).  They set it on fire right in front of us. It smelled good and tasted even better!  Also the Dulce De Leche was ordered and it was fantastic!  My wife initially didn't want any but ended up eating half of it.   Nice place to have dinner on a night out.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but definitely not the best Mexican food in the area. The fajitas we got were over priced for what they were and we've been to many other places where you get more flavorful fajitas for a smaller price. Also this place doesn't have any queso cheese dip which I think is strange. I had high hopes for this place since it was recommended by multiple people but we thought it was just meh."}
{"text":"Gourmet?! Not hardly.  Stale everything. Next time can I have some avocado with the lime in my guacamole.  Pure disappointment."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst mexican meal ive had.  The albondiga soup was a dark brown mess, meat balls meally and overcooked, rice undercooked in a soup. I dont know how you do that. Chile relleno was passable at best.   My sons asada nachos were a bland fajita meat, cold.  Both my daughters and my sons meal was cold.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great place for families.  This is our go to place for Mexican. We have also hosted a get together with friends in the little room. You can't go wrong with the Fajitas. Margs are great.  This is such a neighborhood family place to go. I don't know where else we'd go at our end of town if this wasn't here. Wheniever I have had a question or we had a bill issue they have always \"dont the  right thing\".  The customer is king here.  We've been going for 3 years now. Have only good things to say about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Average Mexican food. There were Latinos eating here on a Thur night. More than a few, always a good sign. Live one man band as we entered. Margaritas made with sweet and sour instead of real lime juice, points deducted.   I had the skirt steak, my wife had the porterhouse covered in salsa verde.  Both were very good, although the porterhouse was overcooked a bit. My advice is to always order your steaks one level underdone when not in a real steakhouse.   The service was very friendly, attentive, and courteous throughout.   The food is good, but not REALLY GOOD. And certainly not great. I'm Hispanic, it's not that difficult to make tasty rice or beans, but Vegas strikes out once again.   This place is just a couple of blocks away, good food, but I'm good for another year."}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorite restaurant around! It took me a year to discover this wonderful authentic Mexican food..I'm from Atlanta and I missed my old place! This place rocks! Hands down best homemade guacamole! I totally recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid Mexican restaurant. I was very surprised by the lack of decent Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Lindo is consistently excellent and was the best Mexican place I found when I lived in Vegas for two and a half years. The chips and salsa and bean dip are delicious, the soup is good, and every entree I've had has been delicious. A great choice if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best thing there was the guacamole and home made tortillas. Otherwise, NO flavor. Terrible salsa. Bean dip flat. Chips with no salt, no flavor. Three of us had shimp fajitas, chicken burrito and three shredded beef tacos. Where's the flavor?! We went her because the reviews were pretty good over all but blah!   Would NOT recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"decent salsa but chips were crumbly. really good abondegas soup."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here.  My wife and I come here pretty regularly.  As another reviewer stated Mark the owner does his best to greet guests and is often seen helping in the bar or talking with the customers.  We truly feel like family here.  They always greet us with a smile and continue to exceed our expectations. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere!  We also love it when they have live music, truly adds to the experience. The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy eating at this Mexican restaurant! The atmosphere is pleasant, service is excellent, decorations are unique and the food is good. This last time the bartender made me a special drink that wasn't even on the menu, which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying this place and I am a fan!!! Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back and try more food!!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, food and fantastic service.  We come here every time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad.  Getting refills on drinks, chips & salsa was like pulling teeth.  Came in afternoon so they weren't even busy.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here 3 times in the last few months. Ironically we've had the same server, Luis, all three times! He is extremely attentive and polite. He is knowledgeable and always makes recommendations about popular menu items. The food here is delicious. I love the fact that this restaurant allows substitutions (fries instead of beans), for example.   The portion size is beyond expectations. This restaurant offers a free frequent diner card where you can accumulate points in exchange for discounts off other menu items.  I'll be returning here again real soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 cheese enchiladas but thought the mole sauce was too watery. It needed to be thicker. The service was good and we even ordered the table made guacamole for $10. It was great and you could tell them how much tomato, onion, parsley, and jalapeño to be mixed in. I would try this place again but not with the mole sauce."}
{"text":"The moment the waiter brought spaghetti sauce as \"salsa\" to the table, I knew we were doomed. We stayed anyway. I ordered Taco Aquacate which was suppose to be corn tortilla with avocado, cabbages, and cheese. Came out as slices of avocado with three slivers of ice burg lettuce. Has so much potential, but lacks flavor and passion."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is good food great service. My wife and we're in the mood for Mexican food and we always pick this place! Thank you again for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at this location weekly since November 2012. We went in one saturday night for dinner and were hooked on the atmosphere, the food, and the live mariachi band!  We go almost every week now and at the time of this review I seem to be \"The Duke\" of this location here on YELP because I check in every time we dine.  This place is really worth it all around. It is individually owned these days and the quality of everything is superb. Family friendly and always packed on Friday and Saturday nights at dinnertime. Call ahead and they will put your name on the wait list. You can also reserve a table on their web site.  The owner told me the entire interior design and all the items were hand selected from Mexico by himself and brought to the restaurant. It's a great atmosphere and the staff is friendly, quick, and knows how to serve hungry customers.  THE FOOD:  When you are seated you get chips, salsa, and bean dip. Always great!  All of their sauces are made by hand fresh daily. I think they have 7 of them.  We have tried, and LOVE the following dishes:  - Chicken Fajitas  - Carnitas (they serve them with a rib!)  - Chicken Enchiladas (with the green sauce) This one is my favorite. The flavors are delicate, the chicken is shredded and tasty and it has me hooked. I normally ask for a side of shredded lettuce and cheese instead of the usual rice and beans. It's just my preference.  They also have a awesome dessert that consists of a huge ball of fried ice cream surrounded by caramel sauce and sliced plantains (think bananas) that is lit on fire and served to you flaming! Soo good!  I have heard their Sunday Buffet Brunch is pretty awesome, but I normally go on Saturday nights for the LIVE mariachi band so I miss going on Sunday.  I signed up for their loyalty card the second time we went back. They put 5% of the total of your bill each time you dine on a gift card that you can just save up and use towards any meal. How awesome is that? I think I have close to $30 right now saved on it.  The price of the food is very fair for the quality you get. Portion size is more than enough. All in all I can't say anything negative about this place... and no, I wasn't paid to write this. HAHA."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The tableside guac was great. The decor is really nice. The service was fast and friendly. Careful, it's easy to fill up on the chips and salsa and refried beans. This was a good choice in this large strip-mall area."}
{"text":"Over priced for half decent food. I honestly think cafe rio is better but my boyfriend likes their tacos so we still come from time to time. We ordered to-go today. My boyfriend got his usual two chicken tacos with rice and beans and I got a chicken bean burrito. Half way through my boyfriends tacos he bites into a stick. A stick?!?? In his taco?!?... I don't understand. He was so hungry he still took a few more bites but couldn't finish the last one. As always, my burrito was just okay. Tortilla was way too soggy to finish. The only good outcome to this visit was my boyfriend finally agreed to never come back. Finally."}
{"text":"I love eating here! They customize my order with no problem.  I like the \"Shredded Chicken Burrito\" with beans inside the burrito and it has so much flavor! The salsa is tasty and if you request it they will bake and not fry your chips. I usually call ahead if I know I am going to be there and they get them started for me. This last visit the place was packed. They have live music that is cool. It is clean inside. I think if you are in the area you should give it a try! There us currently a weekend lunch buffet that is a great deal.  I like that it is near the super wal-mart because since most of my paycheck goes to wally world I can at least stop by Lindo on the way and have lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"I just got back from a meal that my father and I are still talking about, and the talk is all good! The Mexican restaurant MICHOACAN at Tropical parkway and Centennial. The food, and the people that work there give a Great atmosphere to a very good dining experience. I was so pleased with how all the employees work together to make sure that not only weren't my dad and I left wanting, but from what I observed, neither were our fellow diners. Even though neither my dad and I ordered anything from the bar, I could see that a good number of people were enjoying themselves at the bar while enjoying the Golden Knights power on against Washington. If you want to enjoy a good meal and get stuffed--the portions are so much-- with or without drinks, my opinion, you will be greatly pleased with your outing at MICHOACAN..."}
{"text":"We had great service ! Our waiter Luis was helpful and friendly ! The food was really excellent,we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Michoacan is our all time favorite restaurant.   We go once a week.  the food has always been excellant.  Our favorite server is Cesar, he is always polite and friendly, even when he's swamped.  He stops by to see if everything is ok. He is a humble , hard working man.  He's very restectful to everyone.  He has a great sense of humor.  Those are rare traits in this this day and age."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent customer service, bacon n egg  breakfast borritios are terrific, carne asada nachos are a must. The place is always clean and friendly,"}
{"text":"So this is the second time we have been to Michoacan in the last month and probably the 40th time over the last year.  We came in on Cinco de Mayo and it was just awful.  The salsa was watered down, Fideo soup had no noodles, and the fajitas were dry and lacked any flavor.  Additionally, we had a conversation going on between three people that verged on xrated and spoke of their sex life so that four tables away we could hear them with no issue, and I am no prude.  If I would have had my children I would have left the restaurant and never returned.  Our waiter Efren appeared to have no issue and proceeded to give lackluster service.  Fast forward 20 days to today and we again have the same waiter and we again are disappointed by the food and waiter.  We ordered two burritos and a combo and received no soup and my chile relleno was raw and not cooked.  It is with great sadness that i write this as we have come here for years.  I fortunately refer you now yo our alternate mexican restaurant Viva Mercado in Village Square or any if the numerous Cafe Rio Locations, which to this point have not altered the quality of their food.  I may not come back, I will not come back for Cinco, and i definitely will not refer anyone at this point as it is just disappointing. Quality Quality Quality.  The one positive in all of this was the kick ass work ethic by Phibbs bussing the tables.   Sorry Michoacan but now you are just one of the 100's of mediocre Mexican restaurants.  James Miller"}
{"text":"Always a great time!! Service is great, foods amazing.   We've gone at least 8 times in the last couple of years and it's consistently good.  Even when it's busy you can expect smiling servers and bus people who will get you started on salsa and chips!!   We got desert for the first time & that was    You won't be disappointed that's for sure.  The lunch specials are also a great price!!"}
{"text":"Yet another update...  Brunch is now  $12.95(kids 6-12 $6.95, 5 and under, Gratis...  It's not every Sunday anymore...just every first  Sunday of the month...next one  is on May 3rd, Cinco de Mayo  weekend    DOES NOT include  AYCD Margaritas and  Mimosas like before...that's  now an additional  $7 which still ain't bad I guess...  Menu selections are pretty much the same, but this time no ceviche or Menudo...they rotate some items and the two shrimp dishes this time were rubbery and overcooked...Horchata and Jamaica are from a packaged mix (I make both of these at home, so I can taste the difference). Dessert selections are mostly out of a box or bag. You definitely get what you pay for...ALOHA!   Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu  2.75"}
{"text":"I used online ordering to get some albondigas soup last night. My son picked it up for me and it was wonderful! The broth was that perfect mix of beefy tomatoey goodness. I put some extra lime juice in and felt much better.   It would have been nice though if you could order chips and salsa off the to go menu ala carte."}
{"text":"Love the complimentary chips, beans and salsa that they give you. By the time the main course is brought out, I'm already full"}
{"text":"Came tonight with the family and boy the food was awesome. Great servers and especially Luis who was attentive and knowledgeable on what to recommend. Definitely will be back, no regrets and plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Love Lindo!  Our food was great. I always enjoy authentic Mexican food. To me they are the best. Fresh guacamole is amazing. I had cheese enchiladas. They are a little pricey, minus a star for that. As always my go to for Mexican food. I crave the guacamole and bean dip!"}
{"text":"We love the chips, beans, and salsa! The food has always been delicious. The staff has all been there for years, and they have great service."}
{"text":"I was craving Tacos El Gordo's fried intestine tacos but, since I was in \"butt F Egypt\" aka HELLA FAR...my friend took me to his fave Mexican spot.  They didn't have the fried intestine tacos but, they did have beef tongue tacos. Which are a disgusting BUT-OH-SO-DELICIOUS 2nd best choice! Meat was pretty juicy.  And I'm not big on guacamole but, they surely make it a show but making it at your table. Fresh guac/anything over boring salsa!"}
{"text":"Service was good, the chips are thick and the salsa tasted like spicy ketchup. I had the fajitas half chicken An steak the meal was delicious tasted homemade and the flour tortillas are made in house and so good I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food was fantastic. I ordered the reno and cheese enchilada. Joaquin our servicer was superb."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and brought us whatever we needed right away. They even brought a complimentary soup for our baby to eat - which he liked! My husband and I both ordered a combo meal. Both of them came with plenty of food! My cheese enchilada was tasty with not too much cheese and the red sauce was great! My beef taco was a bit bland, but this has been my experience with most all Mexican places. The complimentary salsa, chips, and bean dip were good as well. We would eat here again!"}
{"text":"The margaritas were amazing. I enjoyed their happy hour street tacos the lengua(beef tounge) were great but the carne Asada was kinda bland needs seasoning. The Tortas are huge! Excellent customer service no problems. I went on their happy hour and still left paying around 50 dollars for 2 and a child. I would come back."}
{"text":"Been patronizing this restaurant since 2010 and the food has been consistently excellent.  Service can be a little slow at times but the quality of the meals more than make up for that shortcoming.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I took my elderly parents to Michoacan Mexican Restaurant on 7870 W. Tropical Pkwy, Las Vegas for a Mothers Day Lunch. Instead it was a huge disappointment. After waiting 40 minutes for our food my Mother received the incorrect dish. We had to ask multiple times to have our waiter come back and he picked up the dish, no apologies for the error. About 25 minutes later after the rest of us had finished our food my Mother did finally receive the correct dish but was sloppily put together. We asked for the Manager several times, which we later found out was the owner, Mark Berry. FInally after a bit the Owner came over and asked what was wrong without introducing himself. My Father asked if he was the Manager and he arrogantly said, \"I can be.\" We explained the situation and his response was, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" My Father told him to fix the problem and the Owners response was, \"You were unhappy the minute you walked in.\" We were mortified by the arrogance and condescending attitude from Mark Berry the Owner!  It ruined the lunch and we left. I went to Mark after my parents walked out and told him his behavior was unacceptable and he should not have spoken to my elderly parents that way especially on Mothers Day. Mark's response, \"Well I am only human, what do you want me to do?\"   Poor service, arrogant and unaccomodating Owner and marginal food. That is what you get at this restaurant. There are so many other wonderful Mexican restaurant choices in town that know how to treat a customer, avoid this place."}
{"text":"First visit here. The person who sat us was super friendly with a big smile. Our drink person, Caesar was helpful and recommended his favorite dish. It was a chicken dish with a cream sauce and peppers. It was very good and had authentic spices. Hubby had the chilie Colorado and liked it a lot. Margaritas were very good and reasonably priced for non-happy hour pricing. Thank you Efren and Caesar. Great service!! The guacamole was great but I would have liked a little more ingredients in the salsa. It was a bit bland. Our son had already eaten but had the deep fried ice cream and loved it. Can't wait to try their brunch. We are transplanted from Southern Cal and wanted a great Mexican restaurant with a friendly staff. We found it!!"}
{"text":"I frequent Lindo every now and again as it is my son's favorite Mexican place.  I will admit that I have never had any dish that was bad. I like the salsa (although they could offer more types) and the bean dip. The chips are usually a little over done and need salt IMO.  I do like the fideo soup..it is a nice change.     The Margaritas are not impressive and I am sure I do better with one eye open missing an arm so that is a letdown as I crave good margaritas and will choose where I go alot of the time on them as sometimes I just want a drink and chips/salsa.   The service here is always amazing I will give them that but this is the only location I go to as I refuse to go the the GV location as it looks like a damn nightclub all the time it is so packed.  So final judgment is not an impressive place and another place that is over-hyped by people with no taste for what quality food should be"}
{"text":"Been many times and the service is usually good.  Food is always excellent.   Typically I don't eat the fideo because it's salty but tonight it was better so I adked for chopped chili's.   I received fresh chopped jalapeno that were spicy, I dropped them in and YUM.  Food was timely, drink was perfect,  family was happy.   Luis and his team were on it tonight."}
{"text":"I have been to the original location for many years and found it to be good however the centennial location is not the same. My daughter ordered a chicken dish and the chicken was over cooked and tough. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Ate here last Sunday for AYCE/D brunch.   The ambiance was nice, the staff attentive and the margaritas and mimosas were flowing for those that wanted them (and they didn't go light on the alcohol in those drinks either)!  I enjoyed the variety and freshness of what they had out for the taking, which not only included some Michoacan flavored Mexican dishes, but a couple main stay brunch items such as bacon and sausage.  The shrimp cerviche stood out as memorable, as did a tender beef dish I do recall the name of. Actually, everything I sampled tasted very good.  If you want any of their freshly made tortillas (corn or flour) you have to ask your waiter / waitress for them. A couple at our table bitched about this, but after I explained that if they left them out at the buffet line they would either end up dried out or soggy, depending on how they were left out, they understood and enjoyed them fresh off the grill.  Although the staff sport their \"gringo\" shirts I was not offended (takes a lot to offend this white boy), but it could others:  gringo  (r)  -- n  , pl -gos  a person from an English-speaking country: used as a derogatory term by Latin Americans     We would eat here again, should any future stay in Vegas accommodate the detour."}
{"text":"In the past we've thought about checking this restaurant out while it was Lindo Michoacan but we never did. Recently one of our favorite Mexican restaurants closed and we were driving by Michoacan's after church Sunday morning and thought we'd finally give it a try.   Upon arrival there were several people outside as well as standing in the doorway and once we got closer we realized why--the entrance and waiting area was tiny. I managed to squeeze myself through to get our name on the list so we had about a 20 minute wait. They were also setting up for their Sunday Brunch Buffet which seemed to account for many of the patrons.   Although the restaurant seems small there is actually quite a bit of seating that wraps around to the bar area and even outside. The décor is what you would expect for a Mexican restaurant with nothing over the top. They have an extensive menu with almost too many options so I had a hard time deciding. But I finally committed to the Campenchana along with an a la carte shrimp enchilada. My Hubby opted for his usual: cheese & shredded beef enchiladas. The meal was very enjoyable. I was happy the black beans were actually blacke beans and not mashed with lard like regular refried beans like so many restaurants seem to do.   Although our server was a little slow we didn't really mind as were relaxing and enjoying everything,   I would certainly go back, as there are other items I'd like to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Good green chile chicken enchiladas!! They forgot to bring me my Fideo with my meal but not a big deal. Good chips and salsa. Great atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today was Father's Day & my Mom's Birthday, so we decided to grab some lunch here.  Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.  I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.  I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.  This place never disappoints!  Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!  ¿Voy a volver? ¡Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)"}
{"text":"Server are fast and efficient food is wonderful and well priced hole family loves this place"}
{"text":"Wow not sure if they are related to the other Michoacán places but this place is terrible my food came looking bad and there was no taste in the food sent the food back and left immediately will never come here. Again!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a wedding reception! Kyle and the staff were very attentive to our needs and provided us a great experience from start to finish. Definitely would recommend, and can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"Michoacan recently hosted us for our company dinner and it was nothing short of amazing! The staff is both friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The private dining room was perfect for our occasion and group of 25. The food is authentic, well prepared, and delicious. These folks very obviously put a lot of pride and love into what they do and it shows in every aspect of the dining experience.  Thank you to the entire staff for providing us with such a fun night!  Aaron Sanchez Clark County Pool & Lawn Inc."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bartender Jose is so knowledgeable and personable. The drinks were amazing. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Left another Mexican restaurant because I received no service. So glad I did. Best margaritas ever and Caesar was the best waiter!! He makes a wonderful rolls Royce margarita."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and what a great restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly. Our waiter Fernando recommended the carne asada plate for our steak request at this restaurant. Excellent choice, the carne asada was so good and tender. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended by an acquaintance. Don't understand the handful of bad reviews. This place has great food and seevice. We reserved a table thru Open Table and got seated as soon as we arrived. I had the veggie burrito...yummy. Jim had the chimichonga and a chorizo taco. All good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with my family on Saturday. We had a reservation for 6 at 6pm. We were seated right away in the back room. Which was great because we had my 3 year old and it was nice and secluded so we didn't have to worry if he was a little antsy since he missed his nap. The menu had a great variety. I was excited when I saw Squirt listed under the sodas. Ordered it. They did not have it. Decided to try a blueberry daiquiri since I saw it on the menu. The waiter came back to inform me they did not have it. For dinner ordered the skirt steak. Which is always one of my favorite cuts off meat in Mexican cuisine. Once AGAIN, the waiter came back and informed me they did not have it. I went with the NY strip instead, which was more expensive. My entire family was served their meal EXCEPT ME! Once I informed the waiter (food runners brought the meal out to my family ), it took almost 10 more minutes to get my food. What I did receive was delicious. But nothing was done or offered for the delay or that everything I ordered they were out of. Not even an offer to buy my dessert, as most places would. Our waiter was very sweet, but I feel the costumer service was lacking because of that. I think the extra kick in the pants is that my family wanted to go to another Mexican restaurant that evening, but I persuaded them to dine here and my experience was not that wonderful."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican cuisines in North Las Vegas that we've tried thus far. The fresh made guacamole is to die for. They serve a soup at the dinner meal that's included in the entries plus chips salsa and bean dip. We've gotten the fajitas multiple times, and they are great.  The lunch menu is reasonable as well, and has a variety of items.   If you are looking for some authentic Mexican food, definitely try this out."}
{"text":"Hands down a great place to get some mexican food. Great service, food and it's fairly cheap!"}
{"text":"I use to love the little Fideo soup they used to give us gratis at the beginning of the meal but sadly that custom has died and gone to Fideo heaven:( unless that's just a dinner thing?    Coming from Phoenix I had never seen Fideo served at a Mexican food restaurant so I knew this place was authentic! In Mexico my tia's use to make Fideo a few times a week.  It's a brothy noodle soup with a few simple ingredients that's so yummy!  Since I had company from out town, they always like to go eat Mexican and compare to restaurants back home.  I have been to this location a few times in the past and have always been a fan. I thought this would be the perfect place to stop by for lunch.  In the back of the restaurant, there's a viewing area to the kitchen where a giant comal is displayed so you can watch someone making homemade tortillas so this was a treat walking by as we were being seated.   Hostess was friendly and sat us at the table I picked-luckily I had that option. Being a control freak I always want the best seat in the house.  The soft guitar music playing provided some great ambiance. Lots of traditional decor including ceramics, paintings and carvings, it looked like you were in a little Mexican village. Our friendly waiter was dressed like a Mariachi!  Clever! I was ready to start requesting a song!  Immediately we were served this wonderful complimentary warm bean dip and salsa. The salsa tasted great with the perfect amount of spice and a bright beautiful red color.  A basket of crispy warm corn chips accompanied with just the right texture and thickness.  Nothing worse than a thin or thick chip.  I ordered off the A la Carte menu and chose the enchilada filled with shredded chicken and beef. The red chile sauce was very good.  The fluffy rice was cooked to perfection and beans were very tasty.  Service was speedy and we had friendly, all around great attentive service.  Plates start at about $10 and go up to $22 plus.  Lots of variety to choose from, overall a great place.  I can't wait to come back to try more dishes! Next time I'll try a churro for dessert and guess what Bobby Flay? Unlike Mesa Grill-they offer churros at lunch time! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Review for Sunday Brunch!  Not to be confused with Lindo Michoacan, this Michoacan is located next to Red Robin and across the street from Sushi Loca in the far North West.  Jade hosted a UYE for Sunday Brunch and this place was packed!  Sunday Brunch is from 10am-3pm.  What a deal!  It's buffet style, a short buffet but my favorite part is the all you can drink house margaritas and champaign mimosas!  I had three plates of fajitas and tons of guacamole since I love avocado but where I killed it was the margaritas!    The server we had was awesome, he was busy as hell so I had to flag down others to help feed me my alcohol.  And how we got a big party is beyond me but the live mariachi was awesome.  They even sang to a birthday girl in our party.    Flavored house margaritas usually run for $5.00 each and the food combined would have cost a lot more than the $14 Sunday Brunch cost.  So this was a killer deal, the foods tasted authentic meaning it doesn't have that added fake flare to it, the tortilla machine was spinning and they were coming out fresh to the buffet line.    $14 Sunday Brunch for all you can drink (and eat too I guess) is not bad at alllll."}
{"text":"Wifey & I went to Lindo one night for a light & late dinner.  Not a bad choice!  Upon seating we were served a big bowl of house made tortilla chips with the Lindo house salsa and bean dip.  Hey, great beginnings!  Chips were still warm, I don't normally like smooth salsa (I like em' chunky LOL) but the flavor was good in Lindo's.  But that bean dip though!  Very tasty!  We were happy to eat all of this up!  No appetizer needed!  Actually, we weren't hungry enough to order entrees for each of us - so we did end up ordering appetizers to share!  **Nachos Monarca's - Corn tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, jalapenos, and carne asada, topped with guacamole & sour cream  **Elotes - Mexican street corn grilled with mayo, cotija cheese, and lime chile powder  Both great choices overall!  The nachos were covered in tender carne asada, and thankfully it's real shredded cheese over EVERY chip!  Not into that cheese whiz stuff on nachos.  The platter was big too!  More than enough for 2 to share.  The elote was good too but was a little light on the lime chile powder.  Gimme sour!  Gimme spicy!  Gimme gimme gimme!  Luckily the extra limes on the side provided an extra kick.  Next time I'm gonna tell them heavy on the chile powder!  I probably ate more carbs than I should have that night - wonder if I was able to stay on KETO?  Service was speedy & friendly - the place was packed on a Friday night.  We'll visit Lindo again, maybe next time for their famous Fajita platters!"}
{"text":"Loved this place - the carnitas are excellent. Tortillas were a bit dry, but according to coworkers I must've hit an off night. I would definitely go back though :)"}
{"text":"I really liked the food. Very authentic too. I am obsessed with the appetizer \"Gorditas de Camarones\". OMGGGGG So fried burrittos filled with shrimp and cheese and sour cream. MMMM YeSSSS. Very friendly service and great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"i've had the cognac chicken, fajitas and enchiladas here. it's not completely authentic, which I think is a good things... or, rather, this pace is more new-age Mexican fusion than your nina's Mexican cooking w/ ingredients they use in their specialties.  The (fresh) tortillas are amazing and-my favorite quality of this joint-the food is always perfectly balance in portions. You'll never leave with puddles of extra-whatever on your plate staring up at you, all alone! Dinner usually runs $15-20ish, sans drinks. Only good mexican i've tasted in vegas."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed an early dinner/happy hour here today. The top shelf margarita was super tasty and they offered some fun happy hour eats. Tried the queso fundito (not on the happy hour menu) and it was a very very very guilty pleasure! The peppers in it were to die for, smokey and sweet. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always a delightful eexperience.  The food is consistent, I love the shrimp ceviche and guacamole, the service always great and the prices reasonable for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"We definitely had the worst experience at this restaurant tonight! It's September 24, 2017 and it's about 6pm. Our waiter Luis Fernando was awful. He messed up my order and then proceeded to give me an attitude when asking me if I wanted him to take it back. After waiting an hour for our food our steak was only rare on one end. The presentation of the food was sloppy and our Milanesa torta was served in chunks on bread that was broken into little pieces. Our waiter is really what killed it for me. He had a stand-offish attitude all night and he just looked annoyed every time he came to our table. He really shouldn't be in this business if he has no customer service."}
{"text":"Food has declined. Service was horrible.  When the server finally did come back to table in was in a cloud of cheep cannabis.  This place is a joke now!"}
{"text":"Had brunch Sunday and the food was great. There was a nice selection and everything was tasty. The chips and salsa were fantastic as usual.   Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I loved it! This will definitely be a regular place for me. The food was great! They dont skimp you on anything. I ordered the Burrito and Taco combo. Both the burrito and taco were stuffed with beef and not overdone with cheese or sauce. My BF got the chicken enchilada verde combo and each of his enchiladas were the size of my one burrito. You definately get what you pay for. Each combo comes with chips and salsa (of course), fideo soup, and then a side of rice and beans. For 3 of us our bill came to $37.66. You definitely cannot beat that, especially compared to many other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food and good sized portions. The regular prices seem a bit high, but the lunch specials are really a good deal. The service is so-so, but everyone seems happy."}
{"text":"What do \"Hotel California\", \"Stairway To Heaven\", easy listening music, and Spanish guitar have in common? Lindo Michoacan. There was a great assortment of reworked classic rock playing softly throughout the restaurant today. It was a nice touch to an already beautiful restaurant. There in no shortage of painting and carved wood at this place. And so the afternoon started well enough.  I began my lunch with the traditional chips and salsa with bean dip thrown in for good measure. So far so good.  Next came the sopa de fideo. Its like Lipton noodle soup only better and perfect on a cold day like today. For my meal I ordered chicken fajitas. They came out quick enough. My respect started waining when I saw only two under cooked tortillas for what looked like a large portion of fajita fixings. It turned out there was just enough chicken, rice and beans to wrap in two tortillas. Yet there was more than enough pepper and onion to go around. I ended up eating those plain with a fork after my chicken and tortillas were gone. The flavor was lacking. I like more citrus flavor in chicken fajitas so I squeezed the lemon from my iced tea over the sizzling skillet for that sour boost of flavor. During this meal I couldn't help but think of giving Michoacan a 3 star rating as much as it pained to do so. Then came dessert.  I ordered flan which, I was told by who appeared to be the manager, was \"heavenly.\" I'll be the judge of that. I've had some good flan at many other restaurants in the past. This better be special. It  was.  It was firm and thick yet velvety soft. Rich. Decadent. Creamy. I don't know how to better describe it. It really was one of the best flans I've had anywhere. And there it was, the boost I so desperately needed to give them a deserved 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. The staff is always nice and take good care of us. Their bean dip is to die for along with their fideo soup. I usually order shrimp cocktail and it never disappoints. What I also like is that they have happy hour. The funniest thing from this restaurant is that they sing to you and put a sombrero on you for your birthday, oh and you get a free churro! Recommended for family fun!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic authentic Mexican food! The chicken michoacan is delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Friday lunch date with our waiter Luis at Michocan. Watch the salt on those chips dear husband."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and fast. The food choices are a large variation of regular Mexican food. I love the fish, the shrimp and octopus dishes.  Their drink menu is also large and creative. Plenty of indoor seating with a huge outdoor space. Can't wait to attend the annual Cinco de Mayo celebration."}
{"text":"Good food, GREAT service!  Everything I've ever eaten here was good and the staff will easily suggest items to your tastes.  Great bar, everyone is attentive and if you go in once or twice more you'll meet the owner who is very friendly and loves his customers."}
{"text":"After I vowed never go to Lindo Michoacan again, my GF's dad's birfday came up and I was screwed...D:  Given, this was a different location than the one I usually go to (DI and eastern,) I was hope full on this other location not sucking. And luckily it wasn't as bad.    Let me get rid of the bad... The food still suxx... I ordered a burrito, yes it was huge. They need to put on the description that it is shredded beef. Me no like shredded beef.   Now the good, the reason this gets 3 stars.   What this place has always had is excellent service, not gonna lie, probably the best anywhere. My gf's dad has a mean old temper and is impatient. Every time it looked like he was about to blow up, the waiter took charge and explained the situation, calmed him down and made it look easy.   This place seemed to accommodate my 2 year old very well! Best service for a 2 year old anywhere. Nice clean black high chair with cushion (Lexus of highchairs,) brought out a special sippy cup with coloring paper and crayons. AND she got her soup fast, so that she wouldn't get impatient while we ordered. Not too bad at all.     Lindo, sorry but your food still super sux."}
{"text":"Bad... Bad... Bad.. They added stuff to my bill I never ordered and then fought me on it.. Not to mention the food was horrible. The girl up front was very mean as well."}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican food place. The food here is great especially the fajitas and the Chile verde guacamole burrito. Very decently priced if you order the fajitas for two and we always end up with left overs. This places definitely gets 5 stars for the service. We were in and out in just over 30 minutes for dinner. Our drink glasses were never empty because they would be refilled before we finished. Chips come with salsa and bean dip and they also refill those without asking!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have to say the food for me is ok.  There have been things I don't like but all in all the food is good and presentation is very beautiful and the customer service is impeccable.....always consistent this place is ran like there a family and it shows everyone cares about the service they are providing.  Luis was our waiter and he was wonderful, funny, and we never had to ask for anything.  We always had refills food or a status in our food.  We love coming here more because the service is so awesome"}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is an intimate Mexican restaurant. They sport the description \"gourmet Mexican cuisine,\" but it's not fusion, like Agave. They have mostly traditional dishes.   The restaurant doesn't seat many parties, but the floor plan separated sections of the restaurant, making for in intimate setting, as do the booths with high backings and shallow seating. There's a bunch of Mexican decor on the walls, not tacky at all.   Our waiter was warm and available. Between he and the buser, my water was always full. They started us off with chips y salsa y bean dip.   I ordered the Filet Relleno ($20), a white fish stuffed with octopus and shrimp, deep fried, and smothered with Sarandeado sauce. The sauce was pretty much a spicy mayo. But mayo and white fish always wins. Wins!   My mf got the Birria de Chivo ($16), goat cooked in a beer broth with chiles and spices, served with chopped raw onions, cilantro, and tortillas. It was really good. The broth is an intimidating magma-red, but it really wasn't that spicy. The goat meat was tender and tasty and very fatty ... but that's where the flava is.   The prices were reasonable.   I'll be back to try more.   * off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"The service and the food were outstanding.  The carnitas were excellent!  Our birthday celebration was fun with singing, dessert and a shot of tequila!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really good drink menu I believe they have an all you can eat brunch buffet on sundays"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken just as fast. We immediately received our chips and salsa. Waiting on our server to take our food order took a while longer. The servers were very friendly and helpful and the food was good. I have a couple dislikes though. My daughter and I went to the restroom and it was very dirty. Paper products were all over the floor and toilets. Second, my daughter ordered a chicken enchilada, she received beef. We informed our server and just decided to share the food I had instead of waiting to remake hers. (She's 6, so there's no time for waiting.) At the end we ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Got home, and what a huge disappointment for $6.50. It'll most likely be a while before I give it another go. I normally bypass this establishment and head to Red Robin."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place.  The chips are a bit overdone and hard but the bean dip and the salsa they bring are good.  The salsa was spicy hot and perfect. Their guacamole is made in front of you at your table and very good too.  I had the shrimp Chimichanga and it was very good.  My husband had the pork carnitas and they were very tasty too. The rice and beans on the plate are bland, typical fare for most mexican restaurants. Their prices are also high, much higher than most mexican restaurants. Lunch for 3 people was $75!  Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"Wish the server could've been more specific and informative about what our option upon ordering food."}
{"text":"Save your time and your money! This was my first time coming here on a whim. Salsa was bland and reminded me of cold tomato soup, beans and chips were OK with added salt. Ordered 3 tacos, carne asada, shrimp, and chicken, all lacked flavor and salt. Rice and beans were bland. $16.95 for a below average meal."}
{"text":"It was far better than I expected. I had the Dr Pepper steak and it was tasty with lots of spices.  Even my picky eater wanted some.  They sever chips with bean dip and salsa which was a hit with the baby.  The table side guac is always a plus."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here since it opened and it has never been on point.  It hasn't been our #1 Mexican restaurant in quite a while.  The consistency is not there.  The rewards program is one of the worst that exist.  It's almost insulting. Mexican food doesn't cost much to make and their pricing is on the high side.  We've traveled farther distances for much better quality at a more reasonable price.  Out of all the Michoacan restaurants, the one on D.I. & Eastern or Craig & I-15 are more consistent and not disappointing."}
{"text":"First time and probably last.  In my opinion, the food is overpriced here. Ordered the Gallo Con Cognac and came out salty more than flavorful. I felt like i was paying for the Cognac more than the food for my belly.  I guess you can say the ambiance was authentic. I thought they had a Latin playlist playing throughout the restaurant but it was actually someone singing their heart out."}
{"text":"Nice Lil Mexican restaurant. Food was really good... service was a little slow but nothing to complain about. I'll visit again soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is totally authentic Mexican food. The servers are VERY attentive and polite. The food is well above average quality and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. I got the grilled fish tacos- delicious! They also can make guacamole fresh beside your table! Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"The place was decorated with photos of Hispanic men and women, potteries and Hispanic arts. Very cozy. Customer service was great. I ordered the Chile releno and my daughter ordered the  bacon and shrimp meal.  The portions are huge. We ended up taking it home. Our server, Luis, was very attentive, clearing our table on time for the next dish."}
{"text":"For a Mexican chain this place is above average. but barely. The chips and salsa are flavorful and there are lots of menu options. Entrees are generous but lack some of the spice that I expect from Mexican food. I found many of the items bland, like the enchiladas and the rice. I may visit again, but probably for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Had dinner here on our way back home from Mt. Charleston. Great food, great staff. They all couldn't have been nicer. Thank you"}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a bite to eat here while we were waiting for our paperwork to be finalized at one of the auto dealerships close by. We were seated right away and were also given chips, salsa, and bean dip to munch on while we looked over the menu. They also gave us some soup which was tasty. We were super dehydrated so we were finishing our drinks left and right but are glasses never went empty.   I decided to order Gorditos de Camaron which is a rolled flour tortilla filled with shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and a bit of jalapenos. It's deep fried and smothered in cheese and served with guacamole on the side. It was so yummy and even though this was an appetizer it was huge! I couldn't finish it all so I took the rest home.   The service here is fantastic and very understanding. While we were waiting on the food we got a call from the car dealership saying to hurry back . My husband had to tell the waiter that as soon as we get the food we need the check right away . They not only did that but knowing we were in a hurry we had like four people from the wait staff checking on us to make sure we were okay. It was really refreshing to have everything go so smoothly amongst all the stress."}
{"text":"What a great experience. My fiancee and I were looking for a place to cater our wedding reception. Not knowing anything about this place as we are from another state, or the food, we chose Michoacan based on how the people on the phone treated us. Mark and his staff were amazing. The food is incredible. Main dishes were outstanding and all the rest was so very fresh and flavorful. they made sure we had everything we needed for our party and even helped with the set up. Delivery to our location was on time and food was hot and ready to serve. Guacamole was first class. The cost was really great for our budget too."}
{"text":"sorry... my least fav of the Michoacan restaurants. Love love love the original one on Desert Inn. The one on Decatur is good, and like the one on Flamingo. This one is not up to par.... it is the closest to my house, but I will drive to another location because this one is just not the same level of food. Service is good, thats why I am giving them the 2 stars, and the chips beans and salsa are good no matter what location you pick. I have eaten here 5 or 6 times, just not the same as the other locations......"}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience is always waiting for you when you dine at Michoacan. Friendly and quick service has always been a hallmark of Michoacan. Every single visit to Michoacan our wait staff has been very good. They are always friendly and quick to refill your drink.   One of my favorite Bean dips is brought to your table before your meal along with chips and a great hot sauce. By the way, save some of the hot sauce to use on your meal. The bean dip is warm and just the perfect consistency.   I have enjoyed the Carne Asada platter on several occasions. The Carne Asada has very good flavor and the meat is tender and juicy.  We dined at Michoacan last week for our 18th wedding anniversary. On that occasion, I tried the Chile Relleno. It was an egg-batter dipped large chili pepper stuff with a wonderfully gooey melty cheese. It was wonderful and I would recommend it highly. The Chile Relleno plate also came with a delicious chicken taco. There was a large amount of chicken stuff into the taco with a crunchy shell along with lettuce and tomato. I used some of the hot sauce I saved from before to place inside the taco.   I would highly recommend visiting Michoacan! You won't be dissapointed !"}
{"text":"This place is our family night go to! Jose in the bar is fantastic. We usually get the enchiladas de camarones and they are delicious! Also, the chile relleno is the best I've ever had! Josue and the older busser, can't remember his name, are always super friendly! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I came in here on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. Our waitress with long curly hair was super nice but then after we placed our order she went home without letting us know she was transferring the ticket.   We also asked her if there were any specials. She stated it was happy hour (the table sign said monday through sat but when we questioned she said it was indeed happy hour and $2 wines) so we ordered HH drinks.   I ordered food a la carte - a shrimp taco and a cheese enchilada. We also shared tableside guacamole which was awsome. The shrimp taco was great, the enchilada was just meh.   SO as I mentioned the waitress went home and no one came up to check on us for the longest time. we finally had to flag down a waiter who brought out the bill. We discovered that we had been charged full price for our drinks plus they added an additioanal wine to the bill which I did not order. We explained what we were told to the new waiter, and he brought out manager Jose. At first he wouldn't budge except to take off the wine then he agreed to honor what the original waitress told us. It was really the principle of the thing, we weren't trying to be cheap or take advantage. Everything was fine except for the drink ordeal whchi was handled accordingly."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend loved coming to this place because of the amazing food the abundance of appetizers they give you and the bottomless mimosa margarita and bloody Mary's (only Sunday) which we would tell all of our friends and coworkers about!,we went today and were told that they removed the bottomless drinks for good now. It's frustrating when you find something awesome that is priced just rite and it gets removed for whatever reason yes we will be retuning but for now Lindos will not be our go to Sunday brunch location...when places take off the reason people go to their restaurant because they think it will save them money only hurts the restaurant in the long run."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Had Mother's Day reservations. Food was horrible and waited for over 40min for the food. Service was extremely slow.... and the restaurant  was not even busy, but kept make Mother's Day as a excuse for the service. NEVER AGAIN and this wasn't the first time. 1 Star is to much."}
{"text":"The freshly made guacamole is my absolute favorite! The staff is very friendly and professional. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing lunch today I ordered a tamale and enchilada and my wife ordered 2  tacos, there was plenty of meat in the tacos but it was very plain and with little flavor, it seemed like it was totally unseasoned, my tamale was extremely dry the corn masa was dried out like it was put in the microwave to be reheated, I had to order sauce to be put over the tamale and the enchilada because of the dryness of both, The enchilada had plenty of chicken in it but absolutely zero seasoning So no flavor plain with nothing inside the enchilada to flavor it and very little sauce on top, for a so called gourmet restaurant this place is a flop i'm sorry but Del taco makes a far better meal than what we had at a much better price."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is the best. Great selection in the buffet and the omelette bar always pleases. Bottomless margaritas, mimosas, and Bloody Mary's. Yum. My first choice for a wasted Sunday."}
{"text":"This establishment receives 2 stars because of the past times I went.  Unfortunately, the last experience was terrible, the food was not hot and I was humiliated in front of coworkers, whom I had bought to dinner.  There were supposed to be 8 of us, 3 were unable to make it, thank goodness.  We arrived at 530, one of the people had to make a 1000 flight, he actually was unable to eat because our food took way way too long, well over an hour after we ordered!  My son actually went to the kitchen looking for it, at which time they brought it out, all steaks, ordered medium.rare, were cooked thru!  I have brought people here for years and never experienced being ignored, bad food and having to remind our waiter to bring drinks.  The servers, all of who incall by name after knowing them years came with all our food at the same time, Luke warm.  Sadly, I will not return.  I tossed my rewards card."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I let my husband talk me into trying this place tonight. We have been on a quest to find a decent Mexican restaurant since we moved here almost 3 years ago. And after eating here the quest continues. The 2 stars instead of 1 is strictly for the service. We were seated immediately and were brought chips and salsa and had our drink order taken by a very friendly bus boy. The waiter was friendly. Otherwise, this place would have gotten 1 star. I am very picky with my food. I hate lettuce. I can't eat anything that lettuce has touched. I can't even handle it on my plate. I ordered a chicken taco with chicken and cheese only and a cheese enchilada with cheese and red sauce only. Of course my food came out covered in lettuce. The waiter brought me a new taco and apologized. But, the chicken was cold and dry. The bus boy took my drink to refill and never returned, but he was working really hard so i assume it was an honest mistake. My husband had the flautas and said they were ok, but not very flavorful. The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal and they were just decent. The beer was $6 for a small glass. We won't be returning considering I was still hungry when we left."}
{"text":"I think the place has deteriorated over time, their menu gets updated but not the food Service was good hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"AVOID this location at all costs! My wife and I always go to the location on Decatur and Twain. This time we decided to give this location a try and it was a huge mistake! It took 29 minutes (I timed it on my Fitbit) just for our server \"Cesar\" to get our order! We ended up not giving him a tip and the jerk actually followed us outside and asked us why! I thought that was very unprofessional. So if you want horrible service, than go eat here."}
{"text":"At $13.95, their AYCE Sunday Brunch is a solid deal. Although the buffet looks small, there are ample offerings and they are mostly good. My favorites today included the Menudo, the Gallo Al Cognac, Shrimp Ceviche, the Huevos dish, and the fantastic Guacamole. The Chile Verde had a tasty sauce to it, but the beef was just too tough.  What puts their Sunday Brunch over the top are the drink-till-you-drop margaritas and mimosas. I didn't try a mimosa, but I had a mango and a strawberry frozen margarita. I also tried the Midori frozen margarita and others in our gathering seemed to enjoy all of the available flavors. You can get a frozen or a classic margarita on the rocks.  I don't venture up these parts often, but I'll keep it in mind the next time I'm looking for a solid Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"It's okay but I would recommend the real deal - their sister restaurant - Viva Zapata's near Craig and I-15. It really is much better. LM is okay - but not even close to the quality at VZ."}
{"text":"I love this place I love their chips and salsa and fajitas and bean dip yummy. The wait staff is the best And so is the owner he is great for Happy hour Margaritas are the best......"}
{"text":"Pretty good my girl loved the guacamole pretty cool they make it fresh and in front of you"}
{"text":"The Details:  -Sunday Brunch 10:00am - 3:00pm -Bottomless flavored margaritas and mimosas -Mimosas use fruit puree, not syrups -AYCE brunch buffet; items seem to mostly stay the same week to week -Fresh tortillas! -Accommodates large parties -No auto gratuity  The food is decent, but you get fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole!  The margaritas may been a bit weaker than you're used to, but they're bottomless!  Service has been great, as the groups I've been with have been known to stay for three hours or longer, and the staff never gives us a hard time.  It's a fun little place to start your Sunday mornings with a little alcohol."}
{"text":"Not so impressed with my visit to this Mexican restaurant. I have to say that the food wasn't the problem, it was the service. It was super slow! We were there almost 2 hours. I had to ask multiple times for a drink as well as a fork. My brother stood holding his son for almost 10 minutes waiting on a highchair. You'd think they would want to take care of something like that right away. They really need to step up their game here. I did enjoy the cheese enchiladas and chili relleno, which is why am giving this place and extra star. The raspberry margarita was also pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here for the Cinco de Mayo celebration.. I almost turned around and went home because I couldn't find a parking spot..then in the very far last row waaaaayyyyy far away opens up a spot. No big deal, it's a special event.. The restaurant is sort of small, but there's also outdoor seating on the side. Check out the window into the kitchen for a peek at tortillas in the making, it's a cool feature.. For the special event there were a bunch of tables set up outside in front of the restaurant with a stage for a mariachi band and a raffle. The tent outside had very limited drink selections - beer and plain margaritas.  I opted to go inside and hit up the full service bar. There was a gal bartender that made an amazing raspberry margarita. $17 for a small margarita and a shot of Don Julio... Back outside, we started getting hungry.. Unfortunately there was no food service outside. I appreciate the whole setup, but you shouldn't have a courtyard full of drinking patrons and not allow some kind of snacks..at least some chips and salsa!  I prefer the Lindo in Summerlin South.. It's larger and seems a tad nicer."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cadillac Margarita, worse ever. Luis took our order , and bring us our bill. nothing else, no follow up at all. you would think he would have asked about the Margarita since it wasn't touched. we just paid for it anyway, and left a less than $2 tip. can't remember ever doing that. avoid this place. we have dined here several times, and same crappy service, this will definitely be our last."}
{"text":"Came for brunch; it was ok. I loved the Jalapeño poppers and bottomless mimosas. The price is really reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend looking for some good Mexican food and we were not disappointed.  Got some Chips and Salsa and they were great.  I am usually into chunky Salsa but even though it was thin it tasted great.  Complimentary soup was great too.  The server said it was a Tomato Soup with Noodles and loved it.  I ordered the Huetamo.  Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Taco and Chicken Tostada with Guacamole.  They gave us so much food and I was almost full halfway through but it tasted so good i almost ate myself sick.  I don't think I can describe how good it tasted better than that, you just have to stop by and see for yourself.    Writing this review made me hungry for it again so I'm headed there now."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we are so blessed to have a 5 star gourmet Mexican restaurant so close to home!  If you want quality food and service this is the place.  We have been fans and customers for 3+ years.  Their entire menu is awesome as is their Sunday brunch.  The service is the best I have ever had including all of the strip restaurants we have frequented.  Like other 5 star restaurants, if you would like something that is not listed on the menu just ask.  They always deliver!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place doesn't have a better overall rating ! We love coming here. The chips and bean dip with salsa is AMAZING! Margaritas are good and the food is always the best. You can't beat the tacos for lunch. Great atmosphere, bar with gaming and TVs, and fantastic service. Only complaint is that the pictures next to the tables could use a deep cleaning. They're pretty dirty."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of this place. Generally eat at this location or the one on Flamingo every two weeks or so. No mas... Went for Fathers Day today and there was one party of three ahead of us. We waited about 15 minutes. At this point, a man and woman walk in and ask for a specific server. He sits in the waiting area. The server comes over and immediately seats him ahead of the two parties that were waiting. Very unprofessional! With so many food options in Vegas, my family and I won't be back."}
{"text":"We visit this place every one or two weeks and the food is great.  I am updating my review for their new menu and we attended Sunday brunch for the first time.  I am not a big fan of the new menu concept of \"protein + sauce\".  We used to get the steak & lobster/shrimp combo every once in a while, and that seems to have disappeared.  Their brunch was quite nice, with the highlight being the omelet station.  The service was outstanding and the price for brunch very reasonable.  We will continue to visit."}
{"text":"As part of our Vegas on a budget, my sisters and I stopped here on Saturday and ended up having the buffet so that we could try the house specialties like the Biria, Chile Colorado, Carnitas and Camerones...that and the $13.95 price tag came with unlimited margaritas. We chose Lindo Michoacan because it has won Best of Vegas for Mexican food for many years in a row. I have a hard time believing this is the best Vegas has to offer. The food was very average. The house-made tortillas were good, the specialties mostly bland, the margaritas were made with Sweet and Sour and were very generic. Their house salsa served with chips is very poor. Our server was very courteous and efficient, but there was little for him to do, since we were mostly serving ourselves."}
{"text":"Very delicious. I'm never unhappy with Michoacán. Their chicken burrito, enchilada style, is one of my favourites- add their salsa and guacamole to it very delicious. The fajitas are also a perfect choice. Great prices for great food."}
{"text":"The portions are large and the food was really good.  The service was amazing, our drinks were always full."}
{"text":"You can not ask for a better dining experience. The food is great, prices are fair, and service is EXCEPTIONAL!!! Our server was Juan Carlos and he is amazing!!! Try the table side guacamole it's really yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I had so much fun here at a recent Paws on the Patio event. The food was well prepared and came very promptly.  I totally enjoyed the chicken tacos   Thanks for having this event a great time was had by all"}
{"text":"My family and I go here regularly.  The food is constantly good.  The service is always pretty good, with exceptions.  If you go here for dinner during peak hours, expect to wait.  There's a line, sometimes up to an hour.  There's a reason the line is there though, it's good food.   This is a slightly different style of Mexican of you're used Cali Mex, and it's nothing like Tex Mex (thank goodness, I'm not a fan of Tex Mex).  I've never had a problem with the taste or quality of the food.  Again, we go here regularly.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"I am not from Vegas, for starters. Finding a gem like this is not typical. I had the street elote' (corn) With the amazingly tasty sopa de Fideo!! Just like my grandmas! I had the table side guacamole which was very tasty, they make it at your table. The best part was it was Happy Hour, my strawberry/Mango Margarita was sooooooo good, I had to come  back for another!! I recommend this place for Mexican food. The service was great as well, friendly wait staff. I will be back for sure when I am in town!!!"}
{"text":"The first location on D.I. was my husband and my favorite Mexican Restaurant.  We would drive down from the Mount Charleston/Centennial Hills area.  We tried this location once and really missed the atmosphere of the other location.  However, in March while on a 14-day Caribbean Princess Cruise we met two of our neighbors on the ship.  When speaking of Mexican food, they highly suggested a new place closer to home called Leticia's.  And we've been hooked ever since. GREAT home cooked food, friendly warm staff, great atmosphere in a quaint location."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Its a bit small in size so you feel crammed and like you're bumping into other tables as you try to maneuver around. The Margaritas are good, the food isn't greasy, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome great food service drinks. I forgot what I had but this is our family fav mexican food place around"}
{"text":"This place was my favorite. In recent months the service and food has gone down hill.  Food take too long of wait and when it arrives there is missing silverware, food was bland and its overall experience is a 3.  I ordered enchiladas dinner plate.  The chicken and beef enchiladas was cold inside. That tells me it's not made fresh and its microwaved. I had to add salt to my meal. It was 6 of us and we all did not like the experience. It used to be our favorite place to have family dinners and drinks but not anymore. Something changed and it's not great anymore. We will not be coming back to this place. Yesterday was the last time.  As for the restroom. It was filthy and it appeared it was dirty for a long time. Just dirt and the smell in the Ladies room was horrible.  I give the restroom a 1 for nastiness. What happen to the management of of this place?"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a lot of lunch special options. The service was horrendous. Had to ask to have our drinks refilled even though we were seated in a row among with other people, with our empty glasses prominently towards the edge of the table. Also had to ask for boxes, and then later on a bag because it wasn't provided. There are plenty of good Mexican places around here, so I think I'll go to the other ones in this area and drive to the original one if I feel like making the drive."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here! This will be our new go to Mexican food spot. The complementary bean did salsa and hot chips that come out are so good. We tried the Mexican corn on the cob. I like it without lime. My husband had one of the combination meals and was really happy. I had a carne Asada chimichanga and loved it! Check in on yelp and get a churro dessert for free!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican cuisine north of the border!  The entire staff is on it with the food and service!  I've never had a complaint about this place nor have I ever heard one from anyone else I know who has been there!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing, my family eats here once every other week and sometimes weekly, they have a variety of options and this restaurant is vegan-friendly. As much as I love most of the staff here, some waiters are not the best and can take a while to get your order. I would recommend to all those looking for traditional Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"I hosted a UYE (unofficial Yelp event) for their sunday brunch and the food and service was awesome. I wrote up a detailed review of my last visit and this one was just as good, possibly better. Consistency and value - they get the 5 stars. I think we will come here for Sunday brunch quite often actually.   There was a smaller back room where we were seated. We got sat right away, even though our whole party wasn't here. We were able to make a reservation for it and our table was ready for us at 11:30am.   I wondered if the menu changed per week and this was slightly different from this week to the last time I went. If you're curious of the offerings, they actually update their website menu for that weeks brunch so you know ahead of time what is in store. They keep staples the same but the soup rotated (last week- caldo de res, this week-menudo) and one signature dish changed (last week- shrimp ranchero, this week- gallo al cognac). The rest were consistent to what I thought of last week but these two new items were very good! The menudo was so tender, almost melty. The gallo al cognac was awesome. It had a yummy mushroom creamy sauce.... I don't know how Mexican this is, but it's something similar to a dish I make at home. They ended up being the favorites, along with a lot of people shoveling shrimp ceviche and guacamole in their faces.   The one difference I found out about this visit was about the drinks. Yes, with the $13.95 buffet drinks come with, including mimosas and margaritas and I knew about that....BUT.... I thought that you can get only the house margarita last week, but found out this week you can also request flavors! They had so many, but the popular ones for the group were mango, strawberry, midori, midori pineapple. If you get flavored, they come blended UNLESS you specify on  the rocks. I prefer on the rocks myself.   Service was very good, considering how big our party was and that the rest of the restaurant was also busy. Kyle was our main server and he was friendly and great on trying to keep up on the consistent beverage orders of the group. We had a few hiccups with drink orders, but I don't think having EXTRA margaritas brought to us was a fault at all. If someone wanted rocks and it came blended, someone in our party would want it. One nice touch was that it was Jieun L.s birthday this week and we were talking about it and wishing her well. Our server overheard us and took it upon himself to gather up some of the staff to play instruments and sing to her Mariachi style! They donned her in a giant sombrero and gifted her with a giant tequila shot and churros! It was a really nice touch and a fun highlight in our meal.   I feel like the more people will catch on to this buffet, there's going to be a line to get seated and a price hike. Until then, the BF and I agreed to come often for the great value brunch. This is one of those places that is in my neighborhood and I feel, why haven't I tried this sooner? Finding out about the brunch was a really happy accident."}
{"text":"We have lived here 3.5 years and having been going here since we we moved here. It is amazing. I always order the steak soft tacos or a taco salad. The service is lovely, we know all the servers and they all smile or wave at us or our boys as they pass by. Our kids LOVE watching the sweet lady make tortillas. Amazing place with amazing folks working there."}
{"text":"Upon walking in I was greeted warmly by staff and was seated immediately. The traditional chips and salsa came pretty quickly and my order was taken pretty quickly as well. So I give customer service 5 stars  The food was pretty good but nothing special. I had steak fajitas and a side of retried bean and rice. Food I give 4 stars.   The place seemed very cramped however, thinking they were looking for that homey feel ( which I think they got but it isn't my cup of tea) so the atmosphere I give 3.5 stars.   Overall pretty good and I'll more than likely be back for sit down Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was OK, I didn't eat much as I met up with a few fellow Yelpers just after 10am and I wasn't all that hungry yet. Only tried a few things and they were all decent. Can't really argue with AYCE Brunch with bottomless mimosas/margaritas for $14. That my friends, is a STEAL.  Service was fairly good, no complaints. I left early compared to the others so I may not have gotten my full $14 worth but I had a few mimosas and a plate of food so I'm not complaining :)"}
{"text":"It was packed, Friday night. Service was good, but the food, to put it nicely, SUCKED.  Chicken fajita for two was filled with chicken pieces that looked like they were scraped from a slaughter room floor. The seasoning made the chicken orange, and several pieces were nothing but connective tissue. Onions were not on the serving plate -- well there was one small piece of onion.   Flan for desert, was an insult to flan everywhere and was soaked in something like pancake syrup.   All in all, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. Never again!"}
{"text":"I'm here at 1120hrs....... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE-  food is so so.  I ordered eggs con manchaca....... got to my table LUKEWARM- my date looooved her meal.  I ordered a blueberry margarita..... no flavor.   It's a local spot that, I'm dying to support and show love - but it's a shoot and miss for me! Grrrrrrrrr!  Get it right!!  I want to support locals in the 89149!"}
{"text":"Giving this place only 2 stars because my food had no flavor. The chicken tasted like it was out of a bag and had zero seasoning. I asked for extra enchilada sauce to see if that would help, and nope, still tasted like cardboard. They have NO wine selection which is understandable, the only Pinot Noir they have is Bogle which is bottom of the tiki pole for me. the service was average. This was a waste of calories to me. No, I doubt I will be back...."}
{"text":"service was terrible and the food portion was small,  the food was meh and over priced I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been going to this chain for 15 years. Been going to this location since they opened. I always request Jesus as my server. Best server ever. Attention to detail makes the experience that much better."}
{"text":"We dine here at least once a week. The service is always excellent. I love that they have a free rewards card where you can earn points towards free appetizers, desserts, and 50% off your bill. What's nice is you can earn double points Monday-Thursdays 2pm-5pm. They have an awesome lunch special menu. Starting as low as $8.50. Which includes your beverage and of course unlimited chips and salsa. My two favorites dishes are the Chicken taco salad and steak ranchero. They make the tortillas fresh as well. A+ in my books!"}
{"text":"AYCE (buffet style) and AYCD (mimosas, champagne, midori, margaritas, horchata, and soft drinks) from 10am-3pm on Sundays.  All for only $13...that's stupid cheap!  And that's all you really need to know LOL.  If that doesn't sound like a deal, I dunno what you want!!  The food is good, but I never expect a buffet-like setup to wow me.  The drinks are pretty weak, but they taste good and are bottomless...so how can I complain?  :P  Service is pretty fast and friendly too.  We were here for 3hrs and never felt rushed.  Just hope you tip a few bucks extra if you hang out and drink as much as I did lol."}
{"text":"So I go here today for the lunch special and they tried to charge me fifty cents extra for each taco because they said I ordered takeout. The menu doesn't state that it's an extra fee for takeout nor did they charge me this fee last week when I purchased lunch. Nor was I told this when I called a few days ago about delivery and was told they no longer deliver but was given delivery sites that I could use who would deliver to me. I asked the gentleman could I get the lunch specials delivered for the same price and he said yes! So they just removed the lunch taco special menu off their site. I will no longer patronize this restaurant as I've never in my life been charged a fee for takeout before at any other restaurant. The menu should've stated eat in only but it didn't."}
{"text":"flour tortillas made in-house... steamy, flaky, & fresh to the table. drools.  been here a handful of times when i lived in the area, never had a bad experience. i like their tortillas & chicken enchiladas verdes."}
{"text":"this place yesterday for lunch hour was horrible  poor service saw my waiter twice my bus person was more helpful then him no refills  no fideo soup was ever served to us no lemon with our food much less our tortillas...come on tortillas missing from a mexican plate smh food took forver to make it to the table had no flavor smh for the price i pay for a nice lunch with my family & the linch was horrible this whole experience messes with my outlook ok the l i ndo michoacan restaurants"}
{"text":"The foods isn't bad, but also not meeting the standards they portray either stating \" gourmet Mexican food\"  for how expensive the menu is I have found better Mexican restaurants with better pricing. I doubt I will return"}
{"text":"Very good nexican restaurant. I was a bit skeptical so i just got 3 street tacos; a chicken, steak, and carnitas. They were delicious but very small. And the hubs got the lunch tamale special and he said it was the best hes had. Just a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My husband decided to take me and my daughter here for dinner tonight and it's one of my fav Mexican restaurants in Vegas so I was ecstatic. My server came to my table all of two times. Our drinks were rarely refilled. We sat there for 45 min just waiting for our food so ofcourse we are eating tons of chips, everytime I had to ask for more the bus boy looked pissed and didn't really bring many. Mind you I'm 8 months pregnant so I can definitely eat!! I didn't appreciate the irritated looks he gave to me when I kindly asked for more. My daughter tried some of my habenero salsa and desperately needed water. He came by 3 times and each time she asked for water he never brought it. I'm so overly disappointed in the service. My daughters enchiladas were cold and tasteless, (server never bothered to ask how our food was at all) my husbands Chile relleno was microwaved and soggy. My food was fine but I'm not picky I'm pregnant and starving all the time! Haha. We never got asked how our food was once, I felt so bad for my husband especially since they were still hungry. We left highly disappointed. I don't think we will ever be back."}
{"text":"Best mex sit down restaurant in Vegas!!!! Love the atmosphere and the tortillas!!!! Never had a bad experience yet"}
{"text":"Great food. Love having the waiter make the guacamole at the table. The portions are very large and could be split. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Gotta knock it down 2 stars, unfortunately.  We went for brunch at 12:30 and they had already ran out of desserts. The food was cold and not much to chose from as there only a few chaffing dishes. Yesterday we went back and the chile colorado was bland. We haven't given up on it yet, but our last 2 visits have been lack luster."}
{"text":"I went here with some crazy Yelpers on a Sunday morning for brunch.  It was AYCE plus bottomless mimosa and champagne from 10am-3pm.  We had a table in the very back of the restaurant and it was a smart move on their part as things got crazier the more mimosas we had... which was to be expected.  Free chips, refried beans and salsa.  The buffet includes shrimp ceviche, chicken taquitos, chile verde,  caldo de pollo, flour tortillas, Michoacan potatoes, bacon, sausage, beef fajitas, chicken fajitas, guacamole, jalapeno poppers, rice, beans, salad, fruits, cookies and pastries.  I made 2 trips to the buffet line (I would've made more trips if I didn't have a food poisoning episode the night before) and filled my plates with beef and chicken fajitas, sausage, taquitos, guac and jalapeno poppers.  Food was tasty!  We had the most profound conversations over champagne, mimosa, Midori, pina colada, etc.  The mimosas kept coming.  There was somebody celebrating their birthday at the next table.  So, the servers sang \"Happy Birthday\", put the sombrero on the person with the birthday and gave him a shot of tequila.  I've had 4 glasses of mimosa at this point and I may have uttered the word \"birthday\" because by my 5th mimosa, the servers came to our table, put a sombrero on my cabeza and started singing!  Jesus was playing the guitar and singing.  It was beautiful like church on Sunday.  But they didn't give me a shot of tequila, what gives? My birthday is not until August though.  We were there for a good 3.5-4 hours  and it was definitely $13+ well-spent! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates on a weeknight. Camarones Sarandeados. Shrimp were cooked perfectly; tender.  Sauce was great! I will order this again!! cant attach a photo. I was too hungry!"}
{"text":"Good food and large portions was my experience. The service was fast and friendly. I have visited this establishment many times, only had one experience with poor service."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, feels very upscale.  I was recently at this location for the Paws on the Patio event.  The service was great.  One of my favorite things that I had was the guacamole. They actually make it fresh right at your table. It's amazing.  They also have a great list of delicious margaritas.  Definitely a must to try."}
{"text":"This place is not worth your time and money. Second visit to this restaurant, first was when they first opened. Friday nite visit, restaurant was crowded, Marachi music being played. Seated quickly, drink order filled promptly and chips, salas,beans brought. Ordered a Chopped salad and chicken fajitias. Plates served hot, but items beans/rice were cold. Rice was tasteless and hard, Beans cold a bit sour, which leads me believe they weren't fresh. This restaurnt is way over-priced for what you get, you;d do much better at some local mexican restaturants close by. Won't be back ever again..."}
{"text":"This place was great. Food made like my grandma makes. The fajitas had an abundance of colorful bell peppers, homemade tortillas. My pollo and nopalitos plate was so tasty, my son had beef tacos dorados. They were like my family recipe. Horchata was refreshing and not too sweet. Rice and beans are decent and the guacamole molcajete was Sooo delicious!!! Service was excellent!  We will be back. Those margaritas are on my hit list!"}
{"text":"This place ALWAYS serves us the Best Mexican Food in Las Vegas.  9 out of 10 time we go to this place it's FANTASTIC. This time the girl who sat us did not pay attention to our YELP RESERVATION. Asked for TABLE IN BAR. She gave us a Booth in the bar. PAY ATTENTION. They really tried to make me happy. But to late. Good food still the best. Could not give my normal 5 stars because of the seating mishap .sorry"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I go here frequently, and even though they are always packed, we're always seated in a timely manner. The bean dip and salsa they serve as you're seated is to die for! Their portions are large (I generally get 2-3 meals out of mine), the atmosphere is nice, and the waiters are always polite. Prices are on the high side, but you get what you pay for- quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Brunch UYE with the gang could almost guarantee any event a five star rating. What made Michoacan a successful venture was the endless margaritas or mimosas, good quality food, and all for $13.95.   The guacamole with cilantro, onions, jalapenos, and limes on the side allows the guest to doctor up the creamy green dip to their specification. All of those sides could also be added into the tripe menudo as well. Those two items would be the highlight of my meal. Other notable items would be the shrimp ceviche, fresh tortillas, and roasted jalapenos. Two plates was my limit, but it was well worth it.    Kyle, our server, was on it. Our table was flooded with margaritas at different points in our meal. There was never a point where we had an empty glass in front of us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever. Wait time is 5 minutes or less, service is always attentive and friendly and fast, their margaritas on the rocks are always perfect just like their soup. Chips, guacamole, and Tacos al Pastor meal is very good."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Mexican restaurant.  They offer the full assortment of menu offerings that we've come to expect from all of the Michoacan restaurants around town.  The food is good, but falls short of recipes at the other restaurants.  It's like there's just a little something missing, and the prices are anywhere from $2-6 higher per dish.    Be patient.  The facility is a fairly small and during dinner time there is often a wait to be seated.    The one area that they really conquer and rule the competition is their Sunday brunch.  None of the other Mexican joints can hang with their brunch.  It's a full buffet bar with freshly made dishes, soup, salad, and desserts.  Their tortilla soup is to die for; they offer fresh ingredients, that include ingredients such as avocado and creme fraiche to fix the soup up yourself.  Sunday brunch is $14, which includes the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food! My husband it's fairly picky when it comes to Mexican food. Our waiter Luis was very friendly and always coming over to check on us! Definitely will be back again! :)"}

{"text":"This may be the first time I've started a review by giving the service staff a 5  rating before describing the food. The entire staff was professional, timely and attentive to our group of seven.   The food was very good, as expected.  They live up to the self described gourmet Mexican food.  It really was gourmet Mexican food!!   Then after checking in on Yelp we won a free Churro they cut into 4 pieces. Who knew?   Almost everyone needed a carry out container.  (No doggie food here. )  Then I ordered pretty good cheese cake to go. They surprised me with two nice slices that filled the \"go box\". More than expected, just like the customer service.   \"More than expected\" pretty much sums up this review. We liked it!"}
{"text":"Seems I always get the shakey table in these joints.  Been here two other times and was satisfied but this time, the tAble just rocked too much for me. Why don't I say anything? Because a class establishment would notice this, that's why. And then apologize and give me another table. Food is kind of dry today as well. Will I ever be back? If you're paying I will"}
{"text":"We went a second time just incase we were wrong the first time.  We were not the beef was right out of a can.  Came home threw up my dinner and will never give Michoacán a dime again."}
{"text":"We come to Michoacan frequently.  The service is always solid - every server is always very polite.  Their menu is extensive - they have a pretty wide range of items.  My husband loves their seafood soup.  I usually stick with my Mexican food standby of enchiladas.  Am giving them a 4 because Their enchilada sauce (red sauce) could use some more spunk.  It's not super flavorful.  We love the cups of Fideo soup they give with each meal.  It's such a simple soup, but we think it's nutritious.  The chips, salsa & bean dip is good.  We also like how the place is decorated."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup. Best thing ever.  The prices here are not cheap, but you get big plates and a ton of food. Plus the tortilla soup. They've redone this place a few times since it opened, and right now it is at its best (they use to have an open area with round tables...horrible) but it is kind of dark, and a little cramped some days.  They have a pretty good menu when it comes to the regular mexican dishes, and the beans and rice are awesome."}
{"text":"The food here is good and at time we have an exellent experience  but twice ee had to ask, \"whay happened to our order\" and in noth csdes we had Cesar as our server. It happened again this morning. Just to let uou know."}
{"text":"Enjoy your experience, food fantastic.Yum yum here. No more Chili s for us. Lovely place.Great people."}
{"text":"Smells good in here!  So, I came here to celebrate Cathy's birthday.  Well, one of the many days she's celebrating it.  I live on the complete opposite side of town, but it was well worth the trip.  I don't know how to gauge distance to time in Vegas.  Needlessly to say, I was early.  But, that's okay, I don't mind being early.  The 8 of us were seated in the back room.  Good move as the language can get a little \"Salty\".  Especially after the all you can drink margaritas and mimosas kick in.  I took advantage of that aspect of the buffet.  Which, by the way, was $13.95, with the drinks included.  The food was good, for the buffet.  I had a huge plate, then focused my attention on the bottomless margaritas.  Our waiter was great and on the ball.  The highlight was the singing of Happy Birthday and Kathy wearing a sombrero.    I think we were there for 3 hours just drinking and cracking wise.  I would make the drive again to hang out with this group.  Good times were had!"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was excellent! Fried ice cream is a must! I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  The portions were huge, but the steak fajitas were bland, and the shredded beef burrito was just a mess.  Service was OK though."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place! You are family the moment you walk through the door.  It's probably the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I love, love the Daddy Caddy Margarita! It was inspired by a regular customer and I have never had another margarita that is as good anywhere. We support locally owned businesses especially in Centennial Hills/NW.   Mark and ALL of his staff are wonderful - we feel special once we walk in.  Make sure you have the table-side guacamole - made with the freshest avocados from Mexico with the warm fresh chips. Everything on the menus is outstanding.  They have Happy Hour for drinks and food! Great deal for the money. Huge portions for happy hour. They are very accommodating for any size party.  Use their on-line reservations and your table is ready. Their Sunday buffets are full of different choices each week, but they ALWAYS have homemade tortillas that are the best. They send out emails telling about their buffets - menu specials and other events that they offer all the time. They also offer outside seating (covered patio area). Great food - service - location - staff, etc.  This is a must TRY restaurant."}
{"text":"New favorite bottomless margarita brunch spot, delicious authentic Mexican food and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding. Everyone was pleasant, friendly and on top of things. Drink refills were quick and fast. The margaritas on the rocks are delicious.   The food was fantastic, the shredded beef in the tacos are moist and flavorful. The garlic chicken was yummy and well worth ordering.  The facilities are clean and decorated very cute and fitting if you were visiting Mexico!!  Carlos was our waiter, he was phenomenal. English isn't his first language but he literally was one of the best waiters we have had around in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio set up, awesome staff with very quick and efficient service and great food!! Very pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"The first time I went, I fell in love with the tableside prepared guacamole.  The margarita has sweet and sour mix, not real limes, so......meh.  The cevice was great.  The 2nd time I went I had guac with the cactus enchilada and got sick at the restaurant.  So, I'm not too sure what to say about that except that I won't return.  Service and patio were great though"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go to this amazing restaurant. My friend ordered me this platter with shrimp that was so delicious I can't wait to go back just to savor the flavor. It has special herbs in oil the flavor was unforgettable. The tortillas are hand made in a window in front of us. To top it off I had a deep fried ice-cream; a ball of white ice cream covered with crushed flakes cereal, flavored syrup on the bottom with liquor and bananas on FIRE!!! It was soooooo good. Clean and unforgettable. Why isn't their one around here?"}
{"text":"Great food! We love the burritos; so authentic.  The bean dip that they serve before your meal comes is so good! Always \"stuffed\"when we leave!"}
{"text":"The worst ever!!! Food sucked, service worse, manager worst of all. When things things are bad it's one thing, but when the manager Alan says, \"You knew what you would get and you knew you would be expected to pay for it no matter how it came out.\" That is just unacceptable! Don't come here.  There are too many places with good food in town to waste your time & money on s place like this!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had in Las Vegas!! Place is great! Service was good too! No complains! Just real authentic Mexican food good prices and good times! Also if u check in you get a free churro! I'll for sure be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 7-26-15 around 12:30 PM.  This restaurant is located next to Red Robin on Tropical & Centennial Center Blvd.   I have been to the location on Desert Inn & the one down in Henderson, and this one's no different.   It's an obligatory mexican restaurant.  Yes, there is crap hanging on the walls, yes they will sing to you on your birthday, yes they have margaritas.  I never liked guacamole until I had it at Lindo Michoacan.  It is phenominal.  They make it tableside. Yeah, it's $8.50 but it's soooo worth it.  I don't like avocados or cilantro but I love their guacamole.  It doesn't even make sense.   On this particular day I decided to try the combination plate #1 which is a chile relleno, chicken enchilada, and beef taco($16.95).  Too expensive and the chile relleno was sooo soggy and watery. It was like somebody fried a chile yesterday, warmed it up today, then dumped sauce on it and microwaved it again.  Yuck.  The beef taco and the enchilada were great.   The service is always crazy good.  Yesterday Luis was our server.  He couldn't have been better!!   One star for Luis, one star for the delicious guac, one star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! Our server Luis was fantastic!! The food was so fresh and delicious! Luis made sure my vegan daughters dietary needs were met and was so sweet about it! Clean friendly environment as well."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The servers are very nice here. If u want tequila, ask for Mark the owner. He knows his stuff"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant In Las Vegas Hands Down!! Great Service & Great Food."}
{"text":"located in North Las Vegas, Centennial area, this Mexican restaurant also seems to provide good quality consistent food. I have noticed this occasion the service was a little slower and since it was the middle of the afternoon, the restaurant wasn't busy so I was a little surprised at this.   Overall the food was pretty good with standard rice and beans servings. I ordered the Lingua (beef tongue) tacos and they were good. Drinks were also served at a slower pace but they were mixed well and tasted good.   While this location is about 25-30 minutes from my house it was still worth the drive and until I feel it drops below 4 stars I will keep returning to some quality taste!"}
{"text":"Once we got in, which was a 45 minute wait, the atmosphere was welcoming, but the wait to get our drinks was over shadowed by the hour and 20 minutes it took to get our food. With rough service throughout, it seemed like there was never a waiter in sight when my glass just happened to be empty. Once  we finally got our food it looked better than it tasted. Very mild flavor and chilled from obviously having it sit out before serving with the rest.   Overall all too expensive, too long of a wait, and subpar \"food.\""}
{"text":"Food is good also the service, the salsas for the tacos need a lot of work, probably they need a new salt shakers"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday afternoon and had the steak fajitas lunch special with an horchata. The steak was very tender and flavorful. The horchata was very sweet but delicious as well.  The service was on point, I went with a group of 7 and our drinks were always topped off and our meal came out fast. Definitely will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Usually come here for some nice mexican food the best in Las Vegas...always get the steak fajitas and the fried ice cream is amazing..happy hour specials for margaritas is the way to go."}
{"text":"I came here with with my wife and a friend. We were greeted and we decided to sit at the bar. When we sat down we were greeted by the owner at the bar. Which was a surprise being owners are never there at their place and businesses suffer because of that. Anyways, it was nice and chips & salsa were given to us. The chips were crunchy and fresh. They were not greasy or flimsy, like chips sometimes can be. The salsa was not too spicy but had really good flavor. We talked and ordered some street tacos some lengua, Al Pastor, and Asada. The lengua was melt in your mouth as well as the others. Cesar was our waiter and he was punctual he never let our drinks go dry or and brought our food out promptly. The drinks were delicious and fresh. We shared a pitcher of Frank Margarita and had the best tequila we have ever tasted it was called Casa Nobel it was in a black bottle $25 a shot but you  only live once. I will be coming back here for the food, the people, and the drinks. Very great experience!"}
{"text":"After getting my swole on at the gym I hit up my broski Milkshake to grab some food. He tells me about this Mexican restaurant called Michoacan. At first I thought he was talking about the new Mexican Transformers movie similar to the Decepticons. Sadly he wasn't and we were headed on our way.   After we parked we started walking towards the restaurant and all of a sudden a young African American urban youth appears on some cheap poverty scooter. I didn't think kids rode those things anymore. The 10 yr old compliments my bro on his legit/10 tats and then asks us for a dollar! His homies were prolly laughin at his broke a$$. So my bro goes \"yo kid, you way too young to begging for money. How about you get a job?\" I started lol'ing and as we walked inside, the urban youth yells \"hobos!\" I was like this cant be real tea.    We walked in and said \"2\". The Latinas were mirin. They knew our status. We sit down and in 2 minutes ordered waters and a beer. After grubbing on dat dere nachos with bean dip we ordered fajitas and a burrito. Chicken burrito.    The bar was starting to get packed with overweight blonde girls with a tattoo on her back that said \"American Girl Bada$$\" or something like that. I lol in my head and continued the conversation with my bro. Server was great and so was the food. There was an older Mexican dude playing the keyboard. Every song sounded the same. Some kind of Mariachi music. It reminded me of the time when I was in SA at the Alamo.    Despite the urban youths running around outside trying to hustle, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one our fave Mexican restaurant. Service is warmth and good is just simplify amazing. Place is cozy and comfortable."}
{"text":"We came here for a wedding after party, the service was beyond amazing! The owner personally came out to check on our party and make sure everything was to everyone's satisfaction, we even let them know that not our full party was going to be able to attend and they said it was no problem the patio was ours, they went above and beyond everyones expectations! Food was amazing and portions were OMG!! Free refills on horchata, what?!?!?! Amazing! Bean dip with the chips and salsa, yea buddy!!!! Yummmmmmmy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious very traditional ,  service is great we love michoacan gourmet restaurant it makes us feel like we are home."}
{"text":"Vegetarians/vegans beware... I ordered vegetable fajitas and they even have a little blurb where you can ask for it to be vegetarian or vegan, and I asked my waiter to make sure my dish was vegan. To me that means there will be no animal products on the plate. There was no sour cream and no cheese which is what I expected, but when my food came out there were two big chunks of steak on it, which together were about the size of my palm, so I asked for a new plate. When the second plate arrived there were two quarter-sized pieces of what looked like ground beef, at which point I stopped digging through it because I didn't feel that I should have to pick through a dish that is advertised as vegetarian to see if there's meat in it. That they specify they can make dishes vegetarian/vegan means they're set up to prepare meatless dishes... right? The waiter was good about it and the manager offered to see that no meat was in the third plate, but I declined it because from what the waiter told me everything is prepared on the same grill. To me that is not at all vegetarian since who knows what other little pieces of meat make it on to \"vegetarian\" orders aside from the big pieces that I saw. I ended up not getting anything else because if it's all made on the same grill and no steps are taken to ensure no cross-contamination happens, that's hardly vegetarian.  That said, everything I did get to eat was pretty good. The guacamole was good and the salsa had a nice heat to it even if it was kind of liquidy. The portions are big although it's a bit expensive. My mother told me her fideo soup was bland but pretty good after she put some of the salsa in. As a vegan, however, I wouldn't feel confident that anything else I got here would be meat-free even though it is advertised as such and I had to write this so other people with my dietary restrictions are aware. At worst I consider it false and deceptive advertising to call a dish vegetarian when it's all made on the same grill with meat and apparently mixed together.   Also at the end of the meal when they brought the check, they had taken my order off but they had also bumped the cost of my mother's meal up by three dollars from what it was on the menu and then taken a weird $4.34 discount off of that total. Overall it was a meh experience, but I am giving two stars because it's a cute little place and if you don't mind random other proteins being on your plate, you may do just fine here."}
{"text":"Overall we had an ok experience. The customer service was on point, my margarita was delicious, and my husband's pork burrito was amazing and was enough for 2 people. No complaints from him. I got a chicken enchilada and pork tamale. I asked for all rice and no beans, but they gave me beans anyways. The server took it back and within 5 minutes I had the correct order. My food however was not as delicious as my husbands. Everything was pretty bland. The enchilada was flavorless, the tamale had very little pork and was mushy, and the rice was plain. We will most likely return, but definitely getting the burrito or tacos."}
{"text":"This place was always consistently good until my last visit which was the end of March. The place wasn't busy and guests who arrived after we did got their food first, the waiter was interested in serving as many cocktails as he could for happy hour instead of waiting on us. The manager who was walking around could also care less. When our food finally came out it was burnt after waiting an hour for it. Very disappointed from a place that was hailed as excellent with great waiters."}
{"text":"We have been several times to this location.   The food is tasteless and bland.  I paid extra for grilled chicken in my chimichanga, what I got was a glob of canned retried beans and a couple pieces of soggy chicken.    Not to be rude, but I can get a better chimichanga from the frozen food freezer at 7-11.   These people don't even try to put out a decent product."}
{"text":"I don't find myself in the area often, but I was in the area visiting with one of my friends who I don't see nearly as often as I should I remember the buzz about the brunch options here.   We arrived around 11 and were seated quickly. The layout of the restaurant is just awkward. The aisles are tight to say the least and the booths were even tighter. As we were sitting the wobbly table bucked up and nearly fell over. Lesson learned, hands off the table. We sat and waited quite some time before anyone approached us for a drink order. This was fine since we were catching up and distracted after not seeing each other for so long.   Eventually a waiter came by to take our drink order but it was hard to get his attention with any more questions since the aisles were so tight as he was talking to other tables. We again sat a while, trying to figure out exactly what to do since no one told us where buffet was and we were tightly crammed in a booth across from a large family that had a child in a high chair that took up most of the aisle. Finally, we headed to the buffet area. It was jam-packed and there was quite a line. We waited patiently, but we were constantly having to move aside to let people pass and vice versa. The line was pretty slow, but we eventually filled our plates and headed back to the table. The food was ok. Nothing amazing, but I did quite enjoy the fresh tortillas and unlimited margaritas and mimosas. I didn't drink too much, but felt I got my money's worth. I think they need to have a better organization process for filling up the buffet as it got pretty sparse with the crowds of people waiting in line. Not sure if they could situate it in a better place in the restaurant but it was definitely in an awkward location since the walkways were narrow and the buffet is also on the way to bathrooms which makes for quite some congestion while people are waiting for their food and while the waitstaff is trying to transport drinks from the bar (which is also in this same small area) to guests.  The food was pretty good and I was happy with the meal. Service was slow to begin with but as we sat there longer the servers finally started coming by with refills more often. I'd come back but maybe a little earlier to avoid the rush and request a table in a more open area of the restaurant, like the bar area, that was easier to get up and down from. I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't try to fill the bar area that is closest to the buffet with those partaking in the brunch and trying to put more a la carte guests in the back harder to get to booths. That's what I would suggest for better flow in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great...all the other positive reviews got it right. Eaten there many, many times and have never had a bad exoerience. Try the carne asada, amazing!"}
