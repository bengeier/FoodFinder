{"text":"Their black beans are to die for! I could live off of them. I recommend just getting take out because the seating area isn't the greatest. It is cafeteria style."}
{"text":"I ate there with a friend, it was just OK. I order the jade chicken and jerk chicken. My friend ordered same thing. The jade chicken was so tough like leather me and him both returned it. The jerk chicken was good but would set your mouth on fire. The watermelon Ice Tea they had was pretty good. I will go back but for my first time I wasn't really impressed but all business have there bad days."}
{"text":"The food is definitely different! It a fusion of Mexican and Asian, and depending on what you get, it's amazing! They also serve beer!"}
{"text":"The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home. 
I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!"}
{"text":"Yum! Chinese/Mexican fusion, who would have thought?!!! Seriously, the jade chicken is amazing... try it :)"}
{"text":"Great food and really good service! You wouldn't think that mexican and chinese food would go together but it does!"}
{"text":"They're the best! Nothing more needs to be said. I will 100% never turn down Chino! Jade red chicken quesadila all the way!!!"}
{"text":"The concept of Chino Bandido sounds just plain wrong with it's mash-up of Chinese, Mexican, and Caribbean fare, but everything just seems to go well together...surprisingly.  I visited CB for lunch on a short weekend trip to Phoenix and ordered up a combination that would please my spice addiction - jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, and jerk chicken quesadilla.  They even give you a cookie for dessert.  Score!  Bold flavor.  Surprisingly not greasy.  I was craving more all weekend.  I can't wait to make another visit to Phoenix and go to Chino Bandido again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. We ate here twice a week... The last two times we went, it was horrible. My jade red quesadilla had less than four piece of chicken in it, my machaca quesadilla was missing cheese, and our fried rice consisted of chunks of white rice smothered in soy sauce... Not just a lot... It was soup like! We were so dissapointed, and since it was takeout, we could not get it replaced easily (are were at home already).

Used to be five stars to us... now just a huge let down."}
{"text":"Modern styles intertwined into a combo of cuisine between two cultures. Do not miss out on the Bandido."}
{"text":"I only put two stars as a gift. The food is greasy, and tasteless. Our Diablo chicken was dry and the jerk chicken was a joke. The black beans are blended with cheese and the fried rice was dry and hard. Don't waste your time, money , or taste buds coming to this place. Big mistake!"}
{"text":"I have to be as honest as possible with this review. It is average at the very most and should really be considered a large hole-in-the-wall type of joint. The place is dirty and would be very surprised if they haven't received sanitary citations in the past. As for the food it is below average Mexican and below average Asian and I don't care how many 4 and 5 star reviews you see listed. Granted that I travel extensively and eat at some of the best restaurants in the world, good food is good food whether you eat in a palace or off of a food truck. If you are going to visit here be sure to keep your expectations in check and within reason and you won't be disappointed by surprise.

Final summary: Visited on 21 February 2015. Dirty with below average Mexican/Asian cuisine. Think of it as a very dirty Panda Express and you'll be right on the money with what to expect."}
{"text":"Affordable & good in taste.
Didn't like that the cookies had sugar sprayed all across that kind of killed them for me."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. This place used to be good.  Not only were the portions a ton smaller than than they used to be but the food tasted terrible.  We took two bites and just walked out not bothering to complain."}
{"text":"excellent food, good customer care, but they need to cleanup the ambience to make more family restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting concept of fusing Chinese and Mexican cuisine. It is an eating experience that you won't forget, and while I have mixed feelings on the experience, overall I think it was a good one. If you're a first timer to Chino, it can be a little overwhelming listening to their 10 minute introduction on how to order and combine the different foods. The lady was very helpful in her explanation, and I ended up telling her to give me whatever she liked best. The food itself was pretty good overall, I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot more than others. I think as you keep eating at Chino, you would eventually hone your choice of combinations down to what you would best enjoy. For a visitor, I left with an experience and some pretty decent food."}
{"text":"Being Chinese and from San Francisco, where there is a loooot of good Chinese food, I was pretty wary of trying Chinese fusion food, especially with Mexican. Came here with my parents during our trip to Arizona and it was surprisingly really good and cheap! 

Service was good and so was the food. I got the jade red chicken with jerk fried rice and black beans. The black beans were too mushy for my taste. The jerk fried rice had kick but good and I absolutely loved the free snickerdoodle that came with it!"}
{"text":"I came here from San Francisco for a baseball Tournament...I honestly think school lunch is better.
The best part about my experience here was that my coach paid for my good.The cookie isn't so bad,if you like day old churros."}
{"text":"Came here again with some friends that came to visit.  Great food as usual.  This time they had this chocolate brownie cookie.  Wow..  It was amazing.
Stuck with my usual of the Jade Red Chicken in a Quesadilla with the Jerk Fried Rice.  I could barely walk out of there after we were done eating."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 16 years and it is fabulous!!!  The Jerk chicken is my favorite and then the Machaca is next.  The best part is that you can 'have it your way'.  Be sure to ask for 'tryouts' on your first visit so that you can taste a lot of what they have.  As a bonus you get a huge cookies with every meal...yum!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand what appears to be popularity here....food is 'fair' at best, ordering method is VERY confusing, and surroundings YUCK.....we now go just a couple of doors down to Goodfellas, a Mediterranean place that makes their own fabulous soups and is a wonderful, clean family restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Wonderful food and very interesting concept to food blending. I've never been dissapointed. I like that they let you sample before you order if you are unsure about a certain item. Wonderful service and amazing food."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place.  It's almost embarrassing how much we eat here.  I'm surprised we don't smell like their black beans, pork fried rice and jade chicken by now (our personal favorite three items to order together.)  Maybe we do, and people just aren't telling us?  

Anyways - this place gets 5 stars from me because of it's uniqueness and deliciousness.  Seriously I can't talk how much I love their black bean, pork fried rice and jade chicken combo.  It's the perfect combination -  a little salty, a little spicy, a little sweet.   

For dessert - we LOVE the volcano cookies - which taste more like a brownie cookie.  They only have them on Sunday's but they are a MUST.  The snickerdoodles are good too, but I'm not a snickerdoodle fan, due to an awful experience with the cookie  in 8th grade home ec. haha but that's a different post for a different time. 

If you're looking for a unique dive in Arizona (and believe me, there aren't many here),  then you have to at least give this place a try.  

Oh - plus they give SAMPLES!  It's like Costco, without the lines of kids.  We take all of our out of town guests here and the Californians always end up loving this place and posting pictures of the totally non-PC logo on their facebook."}
{"text":"Being a newbie to Chino Bandido, I got to take advantage of the free samples and lesson on how to order.  I thought everything individually was delicious, but once everything was together on my plate, I wasn't so sure of the mix of flavors.  I ordered a carne asada burrito, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and refried beans.  I ultimately ate the burrito and beans together and then ate the rice and teriyaki together; otherwise, it was opposing flavors overload.  I will definitely return again if I find myself in the neighborhood, but I may just stick with a rice bowl or a combination that doesn't mix so many different flavors."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix on business and yelp'ed some places around my hotel to see what I could get for a quick bite to eat. Chino Bandido did not disappoint! I had the pork fried rice, Cuban black beans, carnitas quesadilla and the red jade chicken. It's really odd how well pork fried rice and Cuban black beans go together! The black beans are excellent! The salsa is yummy and the complimentary cookie is icing on the cake. I just wish there was a refrigerator in my room so I could save this for tomorrow....I couldn't even eat half of it! Cheap, good eats!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I like being a lazy eater and Chino Bandido definitely helps.

When you walk in, the menu is on the left and you order from one of the register people. You have the option of really customizing everything so don't get too overwhelmed.

I usually order #1, the carnitas, with jerk fried rice. I then pour two containers of their hot sauce over it. I then mix it all together and I have this delicious combination of spicy pork fried rice. Yum!

This will usually keep me full for almost the whole day. 

They also include a very good snicker-doodle cookie with your order that is soft and melts wonderfully in your mouth."}
{"text":"Always awsome. Good creative food thats a blend of Chinese and Mexican.  Fast friendly service. Will even give you a sample before you order."}
{"text":"How the heck do I describe or explain this place? The whole place and menu is as eccentric as the child of Kim Jong Il & Frida Kahlo would be. You see, it's a mix between Chinese and Mexican cuisine and there are a million different ways to order. They actually have an ordering demo on their website so you'll know what you're doing when you get there, which I surely didn't when I stepped foot inside.

This has got to be the most unique restaurant I've ever eaten at. The gist of it is you've got a dozen or so meat options (a couple meatless too) and with those you decide between having it with just rice (white, jerk, pork fried, chicken fried or beef fried), rice & beans (refried or black), or as a combination as a quesadilla or burrito. I know this sounds like too much but that's because it is...oh yeah, it also comes with your choice of cookie (Snickerdoodle or Oatmeal Raisin on Sunday). I would say just visit their website to get a better idea of what you can order and all the options.

Because it is so confusing they actually have a small sampling bar to help you decide and coax you along in your ordering process. I felt like I was getting tested at the doctor's office. The had a nice staff member filling small cups with all the differnt options. After tasting various meats and rices I came to a conclusion. I got the combination plate with the Jade Red Chicken (almost like Orange Chicken) as a quesadilla, the Emerald Chicken (a light ginger and onion sauce) as a burrito with the pork fried rice and both types of beans. For dessert I opted for the Snickerdoodle.

This was quite an experience. You literally could have a different combination each day of the year for many many years. The food was good but I warn you it's not like anything you've had before. The tastes were nice but like I said, a bit eccentric, quite different than anything you've had before.

Unfortunately the rice and beans were overly salty. The Emerald Chicken was outstanding, I like the touch of ginger and the coating had a nice crunch to it. The  Jade Red Chicken was very good, it had a sweetness but not overly so. I enjoyed the burrito style rather than the quesadilla. I would probably get both my meats as a burrito next time of one as a burrito and one plain. The Snickerdoodle was very good, almost had to get another but I was full.

I would say you must stop in here if not for the experience alone, its so different then anything you can get anywhere else. I recommend everyone at least try it once. I really do appreciate places that are unique and doing their own thing and this is probably the best example of this.

I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog."}
{"text":"My comments go as follows:

1.  Say, WHAT?  Mexican food and Chinese?

2. It's not really Mexican, nor Chinese.  It's its own thing.  Don't expect anything in particular.  

3.  It's unique and good.  The black beans are DELISH.

4.  As a vegetarian, there aren't so many options - there is the veggie egg foo young (which is good) and the veggie salad (which is not).  I end up getting a cheese quessadilla and egg foo young -- all in all, very tasty.

5.  The snickerdoodle may be the best part."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D and Had to try it while I was visiting AZ last weekend. The service was super friendly and the staff was very informative and knew the entire menu. They made great suggestions & we ended up getting two great meals. The combination of the asian-mex was very interesting i loved the fusion of flavors.And the cookie was a great treat :).I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area. I have never tried anything here that I didn't like. On top of that, every dish is so unique and flavorful that it's hard to compare to any other place. It sounded odd to me at first, being a fusion of Asian and Mexican cuisine, but I am so glad I tried it and I've never looked back. Amazing food, and I wish it was a little closer to me so I could go there on my lunch breaks at work. Five stars without question!"}
{"text":"It's a pity that there's no pub right next door to this place because they would have a rip-rawking business catching people as they stumbled out looking for something with which they could mop up the Coronas, while oblivious to the fact that Mexican food and Chinese had been combined. Yep, who knew that cheese on top of Chinese actually tasted pretty good. 

\"Yeah...,\" I hear you say, \"you're Scottish and you eat those furry, wee beasties that roam around the mountains in that, there yonder place.\" Touche... But, you know what's in the food here and it actually is unique and tastes completely DELISH! :) What's more, they have a gluten-free menu! Yay! 

Off the top of my head, the following items were GF:
Jade Red Pork/Chicken
Emerald Chicken
Gringo Chicken
Egg Foo Young (minus the pork and gravy)
Pollo Diablo 
Machaca
Carnitas
Rice
Beans


I plumped for the Emerald chicken and Jade Red Chicken with black beans and rice. Soooo good. I don't mind the aluminum food bowls at all, but then I didn't come here with the mistaken impression that I was eating at Chez Froo Froo or having afternoon, high tea at The Ritz.

Anyway, I'll definitely be going back. Chino offers great value for money and the staff are uber-friendly! A big thumbs-up from me. I'll update with five stars when more nutritional info is given for items on the menu."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since we were children. It's still probably my most favorite restaurant ever. The owners know my dad and they are the nicest people ever. I always loved getting the snicker doodles with my meal. My favorite picks would be the jade red chicken, machaca beef, emerald chicken, black beans, jerk fried rice and I love getting the machaca in a quesadilla. But I love how u can mix and match and even make things into a burrito! Such a cool infusion of Mexican and Chinese food. I've tried everything on the menu the only thing I can't eat is he diablo chicken even tho it's delicious lol it just kicks ur butt with the spicyness!!"}
{"text":"I first saw this restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Mexican and Asian Fusion choices on the menu sound strange at first but the combination is undeniable!  The dining room is nothing fancy, but everyone is here for the great food!"}
{"text":"I love the Chinos for lunch.
 I Love it even more for dinner (you see the distinction? I used a capitol \"L\"). There are always wonderful Mexican-Chinese fusion plates, but there are actually available tables to sit at for dinner. To some, this combination may sounds like heaven and to others, a gut-bomb, but no matter.....You must go and try it. It is impossible not to fall in love! I am not sure where \"jerk\" spices originated, but the food is infused with those tasty flavors as well. 

If you have never been to the Chinos before, don't fret. There are samples available of just about everything on the menu. Also, you may want to have the staff walk you through how to order on your first visit, as the process can be a bit confusing. Each meal is topped off with a cookie, usually snicker doodle, but if you are really lucky, you may be blessed with a chocolate lava. Best wishes and go hungry!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido Takee-Outee is a family business that I have eaten at for over 20 years. They have 2 locations, 19th Ave & Greenway in Phoenix and Chandler Rd. & Dobson in Chandler. I grew up near the Phoenix location and was addicted to their version Jerk Chicken and Pollo Diablo from first bite. When their food is fresh & demonstrates the diligent quality control that the owners intend, it is a gem of an experience. 

I was thrilled when they opened Chandler, as I now live there. Eve & Frank (owners) were around often in the beginning and it was just as wonderful as the original. Since the first year, however, the quality has really declined from the flavorful, made-to-order, quirky food that landed them on Food Network's, Diners Drive-Ins & Dives. 

Yesterday we were craving the TJ Veggie Quesadillas. This flat, bland, lettuce quesadilla was a far cry from the salad veggie packed quesadilla with seranno peppers. The Pollo Diablo in its intended form is one if my favorites. It lacked the attention that makes it so good. The garlic tasted burnt and it tasted as if it had also sat. I also ordered the Saturday special, Bean Tostada. While the black beans seem to be an infallible recipe, they loaded my poor 3 inch corn tortilla with a soup bowl of beans. I tried every which way to eat it and could not. I returned it and asked for another, & then understood why the 1st had a pool of beans. The corn tortilla could not be bit, cut, or torn  because it was so tough. My husband wanted to try something new and went for Chili Relleno. The Chili nearly disappeared among the greasy 1/2\" thick cracker crust. His Gringo Chicken was good though. He use to get the Machaca often, however he tried several times in lthe last year and has decided not to anymore because it was often mushy. My son's Teriyaki Chicken was  good. The cookies were wonderful, chocolate volcanoes cooked perfectly soft. The daily cookie is the snickerdoodle, which is fine.

The 2 stars are in recognition that I love their Refried Black Beans & Volcanoes, and the Jerk , Teriyaki & Gringo Chicken are fairly consistent. It lacks the finesse for why they developed a cult-like following to begin with: Quality unique food. 

I will make a trip to the original location soon to see if they have upheld the beautifully simple, yet unique integrity of Eve & Frank's vision. I hope enjoy a perfectly glazed piece of Jade Red Chicken in all it's balanced sweet & spicy glory (rather than the gloppy stagnant stuff Chandler dished out to me a few months ago). I will post the outcome of that visit soon......stay tuned...... I am not giving up on them yet."}
{"text":"Lived up to it's reputation on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  So many choices of meats and they'll let you sample as many as you'd like.  Served in a shiny aluminum take out dish and best served right into your belly!

Lots of food for like $8 or something ridiculous.  Great for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here.. excellent food, took a few attempts to get used with the order form. If you get the right combinations, its very unlikely to go wrong. 

9Q & 7,   W, BLK    is my standard... :)"}
{"text":"Jay Z and Beyoncé, milk and cookies, Chino Bandido, Nutella and virtually anything.... What do all these have in common? Two worlds coming together to create a dynamic duo! Chinese food meets Mexican food! The greatest love story that has never been told! We enjoyed everything we ate, Jerk chicken, red jade chicken, jerk rice, black beans, pork and jerk chicken quesadilla! Don't let the jerk word fool you it has great robust flavor with even better price! I recommend this place on your next outing fo sho."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is amazing. There are never any surprises, you always know what you're getting, and it's always super speedy and super delicious. 

HOWEVER - a caveat to consider: similar to any place where you \"make your own\" entree or combination, a certain amount of the burden of flavor can be said to fall upon you and your choices. Just sayin'!

Chino Bandido is a grungy little hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the \"grunge\" factor comes from age, rather than neglect. Inside, it is brightly lit with sparse but funky decorations...including a big statue of their mascot, an angry-looking panda bear in a sombrero and bullet belt, chopsticks in one hand and a bowl of rice in the other. 

From this brief description of their mascot, I'm sure you've caught on to Chino Bandido's gimmick - Chinese-Mexican fusion. 

There is no need to go into some long and theoretical discussion of whether this is a good idea or not  - make the drive, make an order, and make your stomach smile. The food is inexpensive, tasty, and portioned very generously. 

While it is not complicated to order once you're there and looking at the order form, it would be hard to explain here. Luckily, their website has an awesome, (and very helpful) Menu Demo tool that shows you exactly how the ordering process works, complete with a rough picture representation of what your combo order looks like. This feature on their website alone was enough to impress me into a first visit, and what I found when I arrived was more than convincing enough to keep me coming back. 

Ask to sample something, if you're not sure! They will be happy to oblige you. On my first visit, they even made me go through a whole taste-test thing, where the boy behind the counter had me sample a variety of meats and rices from the menu so I'd have an idea of what I might like. This, however, was at the Chandler location, so I'm not sure if this first-time policy carries over to the Phoenix location. 

Some of my favorite things to order are the Jade Red Chicken (in a quesadilla, especially - I'd say this is a MUST TRY), the Emerald Chicken, and the Jerk Chicken, (also best in a quesadilla). The jerk fried rice is delicious, and the other rice varities are good, too. The only thing I've ever tried there that I didn't love was the Pollo Diablo, which was dry, crusty, and...just didn't taste good. My boyfriend loves the Chile Relleno, and, while i'm normally not into that dish at other restaurants, I've been known to sneak a bite or two of his here. :)

A soft and sweet snickerdoodle cookie is included with every order, and, on the weekends, you can even sub it out for a \"special order\" weekend cookie - I've only tried one of these, and it was a chocolate brownie cookie which was just as good as the phenomenal snickerdoodles. 

So, give it a try. Get it to go. Chances are, you'll love it, and if you don't, you're out less than $10. Take a walk on the wild side; find your inner angry-panda-with-a-sombrero. It's kind of cool, having a fu manchu."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a vacation with my cousin, and I enjoy one of the best burritos I have ever had - either that, or I was really hungry.  We drove about 20 minutes to go to a complete dive.  You wait in line, order at the counter, and enjoy fantastic food. Go with the traditional meats or go wtih the Asian flavors, you just cannot go wrong at Chino Bandido, and definitely order two."}
{"text":"I took my friend from Mexico here and she just laughed at me. \"This is such an American thing to do,\" she said, \"taking the most unhealthy things from different cultures, then smothering them with cheese.\" I didn't hear any complaints in that sentence, really. Chino Bandido is an all-American idea. It's like a bacon and peanut butter sandwich, a deep fried oreo, a Coney Island hot dog eating contest. 

It's just genius. The jade red chicken on it's own is wonderful, but pairing it with black beans or putting it in a gooey cheese quesadilla just enhances the whole experience. And, though my foreign friend laughed, she was happy to box up the leftovers for the next day!

I think the icing on top of this patriotic cake was really the warm snickerdoodle that comes with every meal. My friends have this crazy rule that you smash the cookie with your fist, because it's really fluffy and it makes it bigger if you squish it down a little. There's really no science behind it, but maybe we can start a trend?

This is a true Phoenix essential, and a silly and fun place to take out-of-towners, or just yourself when the mood strikes!"}
{"text":"Yes Chino! The Gods of Chinese, Mexico, and Caribbean fusion have answered my pleas! 

THIS is the chino I know and love, and have frequented since forever. I have in front of me a tin of deliciousness filled to the brim, an extra snickerdoodle, and I'm sporting a gigantic grin that can only be caused by this sort of food euphoria. 

What's more important, the old chino is back on the inside too! And that's what counts right? I was greeted by a friendly girl who offered to help with ordering, and several people were smiling and looked like they were enjoying the bustling Sunday night atmosphere. Speaking of bustling, it was! And it felt great, all sorts of energy in the room and all positive vibes. 

I doubt my previous reviews had anything to do with it, maybe I just got unlucky a few times...but whatever it is, chino is back to its rightful place at the forefront of my mind and heart, and it retakes it's reign as the absolute best and most unique dining experience in Phoenix. 


Here's lookin at you chino, you absolute legend."}
{"text":"Always good food, but I did see a lady serving food picking up trash with gloves on and then serve people food without changing her gloves. Hopefully an isolated incident. First time I've ever had a questionable experience."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to coming here since I knew I was moving to Phoenix, and I finally had a chance today. Usually when I have such high expectations, I get disappointed, but this place is seriously THAT good! 
Don't miss the jerk chicken fried rice, or the special sauce they make that's somewhere between molè and teriyaki sauce. 
The place is really big with large tables. They're very family friendly, and accommodated my toddler with a special kid bowl, a box of big Legos, and a cellophane wrapped high chair for easy clean up. Genius! You place your order by filling out a menu form, then you pay and the food is made fresh to order. They bring it to your table and the rest is magical! I paid about $10 for me and my daughter, with food leftover. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is always very consistent and delicious! We go there all the time and in the many visits we have been there they have only messed up our order once and they went above and beyond to correct it! I would definitely recommend this place to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Talk about quirky.  It's got it all.  The tasting bar is the way to go.  I think the veggie quesadilla is good. I also like the carnitas.  They even have cookies with your meal.  It's a place you have to try.  If you are into a fancy place this is not for you.  I happen to think good food can come fro some hole in the wall places."}
{"text":"Not only is their food consistently phenomenal every time I come, but they have great staff- I left my purse in the restaurant and they grabbed it for me and had it waiting upon my return. Great employees. You also must try the jerk fried rice!"}
{"text":"We couldn't remember if we liked this place the first time so tried it again since its so close to our house. The only reason it gets one star is because of the price. To be blunt, the food was disgusting. We ordered a Jade Red Chicken rice bowl and \"Burrito\". The \"burrito\" is nothing more than the meat soaked in sauce and wrapped in a tortilla, nothing else inside at all. The chicken for both of our meals felt like it was wrapped in plastic, which may have been the case since my wife did in fact find a piece of plastic in her bowl.  Also not a surprise but she's been nauseous since a couple hours after eating. Honestly, it was chewy, stringy, and the sauce was way too sweet. I want this place striken from my memory., Never again."}
{"text":"I'm glad we live close. If you walk in you wouldn't think much. But the food is amazing!!!!!  Well worth checking it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...

I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.  I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... \"Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!\"  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, \"They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss....\"..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....

So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!  

At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix.... I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta - I would be the first customer in the door on opening day, guaranteed...."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month and I love it. Its far from fancy but they have Great Food, fast service, and you get a cookie for free with every meal. Whats not to love about that! ! !"}
{"text":"Never again!
A friend from out of town suggested Chino Bandido, as she saw it on a Food Network TV show.  I was not enthused about the idea, as I know from other reviews and personal experience that the show (Diners & Dives) highlights novel approaches to food, but not exactly food of great quality.  What makes for ratings doesn't make for a great meal in many cases.  First, it is chaotic in the restaurant, you need to know what you want when you get up to the counter, and no one explains the process.  The idea is a fusion of sorts between Chinese and Mexican, and I'd say it was a worst-of-both-worlds approach to dining.  Most of the meat was deep fried (with various sauces), served with refried beans and absolutely no vegetables.  Think tasteless chicken breast, smothered with teriyaki sauce, with a side of refried beans and a bunch of white rice.  The decor of the place didn't help anything--certainly didn't make the experience any better.  Linoleum and uncomfortable decades-old chairs.  The regulars were enthused, and if you looked around you'd see many people who were very overweight (too many servings of refried beans, apparently).  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Chinos has not only the best chile relleno's I have ever had in my life but I think it may very well be the best food in the entire Phoenix area!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I moved here in 2000. As far as the 5 star rating \"as good as it gets\", well, it's as good as it gets for what it is. I think some of the other reviewers just don't \"get it\".  Is it extremely good mexican food? No. Is it extremely good chinese food? No. Are there booths and waiters? No. Does it have good food, for a good price, quick, friendly service, and a good casual atmosphere? Yes!

And to the people who say \"I don't think I want chinese and mexican at the same time\"... Are you stupid? Then just order one! Duh! No one is forcing you to order both. 

And then to the people who say ordering is confusing... have you never ordered off a sushi menu? Very similar. And, the staff will help you order, if you're just way out there and don't understand.

And to the ones who say \"I don't see how a snicker-doodle cookie ties in?\" Dude - you're getting a free cookie! Who cares how it \"ties in\"?

Sorry for the negativity, but I hate it when people don't \"get\" that this is a dive joint, with a concept - one of the best dive joints/concepts in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't know why there aren't more Chinese-Mexican fusion places, maybe because the name conjures up some frightening images.  Vanquish those scary thoughts because this place is great!  My persona favorite is their Emerald Chicken Quesadilla.  And how can you go wrong when you get a snicker doodle cookies with your food?

Steer clear if you're looking for anything even slightly resembling \"authentic\" Chinese or Mexican, but if that's what you were expecting from a place called \"Chino Bandito\" with a Bandito Panda chowing down with a pair of chopsticks you shouldn't be allowed to choose where you eat anyway."}
{"text":"This place gave my friend and I (after asking if it was our first time eating there) EIGHT samples to try!!
They explained the food is named after children-which I didn't really understand, but who cares it was SUPER SUPER TASTY!
I really like their asada, and I think its called chicken jade or something like that..but you can have ANY of the items made into a burrito, a rice bowl, or a quesadilla. 
It's pretty amazing.
I ordered #5 garlic chicken with onions and tomatoes the tomatoes were not really stewed more like they were baked with the chicken, nothing really overpowered anything it was a great balance between all the flavors, and on top of plain rice it was perfect!
Atmosphere is fastfood dining, and they have outdoor seating for smokers like me.  My friend ordered the Carnitas  on top of their version of fried rice, which has meat in it -giving the rice a delicious flavor - just engulfed the plate in a matter of minutes, it was THAT good!
Highly recommend this place, the items on the menu are extremely well thought out, the prices are amazing for the food you get -5.00 for a large plate!! AND you get your choice of cookie for desert..the chocolate one melts in your mouth, its gooey on the inside in some parts of it and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They brought our order TO us outside, which they didnt have to..As far as customer service goes, they are on it.
I would say it's on a gourmet level in a fast food wrapper.
GO!
*right now there is construction that obstructs the front of the place, but doesn't affect parking, which there is plenty of*"}
{"text":"Great service, good food. I don't get to eat here as often as I would like, but I consider it a treat when I do. Not the cleanest place in the world, but i'm not a germ freak like a lot of people so it doesn't bother me. I always get the Jerk Chicken, just the right amount of spice and \"kick\" to it. I have tasted some of the other items on the menu and all have tasted good. Chino Bandido is one of those places that I go too when I have guest from out of town. It's great in the fact that it's unique. The service has been great every time I have been here. If your from somewhere other than the phoenix area ask for help from the employees and try the samples."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at the Phoenix location for many years. My mom introduced my family to this restaurant  over 10 years ago I personally have always loved the food and always thought it was the best combination of my two favorite foods.

Let me start off by saying this place is so hard to find! I went in the evening an it's located in a business park with only one sign and the front of the restaurant is not well lit so forget about patio dining.

With that being said I tried this location since I recently moved to the east valley. I ordered my usual carnitas quesadilla, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and refried beans. Let just start off to say the beans were canned and none of the food was hot maybe a little warm. I was not impressed with the jade red chicken it didn't taste like what I remember it wasn't even red, it was more like a sad version of pandas orange chicken.  The quesadilla had very little cheese and some carnitas which tasted good but was dry from the lack of cheese. Overall the whole meal was a disappointment mostly because I'm so use to the Phoenix location and the quality of food is not the same at all! I will continue to go to the Phoenix location but will never go back the this one."}
{"text":"Great fusion awesome value. Decor is plastic chair casual. few different types of fried rice. I usually get the emerald green chicken in a quesadilla plus one other item in the rice bowl. ask for the sampler if its your first time many great choices with a fresh cookie ending with every meal. don't be a fool get the snickerdoodle."}
{"text":"Went here because I saw the DDD episode and it lived up to my expectations. At first I was really nervous for the mix of asian and mexican but I was happily surprised. I had the red jade and it was a lot like an orange chicken but better. Kind of a little hole in the wall but worth making the trip."}
{"text":"A true hole-in-the-wall spot as the surrounding plaza can seem a bit questionable. However, looking past that, the food is great and the portions are very good given the prices! I like getting the combo platter where you get 2 meats with rice and beans for sides. For the meats, I almost always choose jade red chicken with jerk chicken - which can get a bit spicy (it doesn't hit you immediately but it definitely creeps). Would recommend!"}
{"text":"the best food ever!! GUY is right OMG amazing love them love them love them you have to try them if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Another triple D place. Very unique and pretty good. They let you sample everything before you order. Food is hot and service is quick. Lots of people in line. You need to at least give it a try."}
{"text":"I have to be honest when I first heard about this place I was not very impressed. Chinese/ Mexican fusion cuisine? Do they even know what they are doing?!

I Was Wrong!

The Chinese food they offer had really authentic flavor, and the Mexican food they offer is just delicious. When you combine the two together... I can only say whoever came up with the idea was a GENIUS! 

Price was good, only problem I have, which really shouldn't be a problem, was that the portion was too big. I felt all the beans, rices, meats, and greases may shorten my trying to be healthy life. 

Is it worth it though? Yes! Totally!!"}
{"text":"I can't give 3.5 stars, and 4 is definitely too many...so 3 will have to do.  I live across the street, and never heard of this place until my buddy who lives in Kansas came to visit, and posted about it on FB.  I have to admit, I was intrigued about the concept.

I went in, tried the sampler, and thought it was tasty.  I got Red Jade Chicken and the Pollo Diablo.  Both were tasty.  I got one in a burrito, which was nothing more than them just wrapping the chicken up in a tortilla...no lettuce or beans or tomatoes or sauce...just meat and tortilla. 

The rice (jerk) was really good.  All in all...I may go back.  It was reasonably priced, and  the portion size was good."}
{"text":"this is some great food.Never know it by looking at the location or outside of building.Wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"I love Chino Bandito!  Sometimes when a place tries to combine too many genres of food nothing ends up turning out well but they definitely manage to defy this logic.  

The food is a mix between Jamaican, Mexican, and Chinese.   All of which I love.  The ordering system is a bit confusing but the staff is always extremely helpful, cheerful, and will offer to guide you through Chino \"University\" with samples of some of their top dishes.  

I always get a combo with jamaican black beans, pork fried rice, machaca in a quesadilla, and either the jade red chicken or pollo diablo.  I'm sure the other selections on the menu are also great but this combo has been a winner from day one so I tend not to stray too far from it :-)  I did try the jerk chicken once and wasn't a big fan, although they do claim it is one of their top dishes.  The emerald green chicken was tasty as a sample but I'm not sure I could eat an entire dish.  I believe the jade red chicken is their top seller and I can definitely understand why.

Also, both locations (19th ave and greenway and the Chandler blvd and Dobson) are great.  I prefer the 19th Ave location since it is the original but both locations have the same great food.  I know sometimes people are wary of straying from the original location for fear the quality of the dishes may be compromised.  The owners would be smart to open up a 3rd location near ASU's main campus.  Students would love this place, especially since you get such enormous portions for about $10.  Plus, this is for my own selfish reasons since I would like a location closer to  me :-)

Love it! Check it out people!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews about it.I was never offered any \"free samples\" that everyone keeps taliking about:(.The kid at the counter knew it was our first time there too.He was very nice and helpful though.
I thought the food was pretty good,but did not really like the menu so much.It seems like the only chinese chicken they have is either,ginger,deep fried,or jerk.All of which I'm not a fan of.Oh yeah they do have terryaki chicken,which i ordered.It was pretty good.Also the white rice i got was perfectly cooked.I sampled some of my B.F.'S Jerk chicken and black beans and they were delicious!I usually hate jerk chicken,but Chino Bandido's is awesome.
I thought the food was good,nothing special.I really did not like the ordering process.(fill out a form and hand it in???)weird.Also the decor is dingy,drab,depressing,and dirty.Reminds me of a high school cafeteria.(only not as clean).
The cookie they gave us with our meals was really good too.I think it was a snickerdoodle.
Overall the food was good,but i don't see why everyone acts like it's the best food ever.It's not THAT great.
T he atmosphere is what really turned me off.I'd eat here again,but really gotta be in the mood for it.I know it's fast food,but it got a little annoying when every customer who came in after us decided to sit RIGHT next to us even though there were plenty of empty tables.And they all had loud, whiney kids with them too.(obviously not chino bandido's fault)but still annoying."}
{"text":"A panda with mustache and sombrero... doesn't get much better than that. Loved the carnitas and cuban beans. Volcano cookie all the way!"}
{"text":"This place seriously rocks.  It satisfies basic cravings for Chinese and Mexican, with a quick pass over Jamaica if you're in the mood.  While there really isn't any \"service\" per se (you walk up to the counter and fill out an order form) the folks behind the counter are very friendly and helpful.  The ordering system can even be a bit confusing for a regular, but they'll take your order verbally, which is nice.  There is a sample center for newbies where you can get a spoonful of eight of their offerings, which is also nice.

The menu is simple and complex at the same time.  There are about a dozen protein choices, which is simple enough.  I think there are some vegetarian things on the menu, but I'm not sure, being more of a carnivore.  There are also four choices of rice (fried plain, pork, chicken or jerk) and two choices of beans (black and refried).  Then there are the delivery choices:  rice bowl, burrito, quesadilla or plain.  You can do one item, or a combo of two, with rice and beans.  The number of possible combinations is difficult to calculate, especially for math-anxious me.

The food is very good, and is high quality.  It's not sublime, fine cuisine.  Its ingeniousness does not lie in the ingredients or their preparation, but rather in the strange and wonderful combinations that can be created.  The emerald chicken is memorable:  moist chicken breast with a lovely sauce made from ginger, green onions and salt.  I googled this, found a recipe online and made it at home but mine wasn't nearly as good.  Chinese BBQ pork is just what it should be: five spice-y and sweet.  I'm too much of a wuss to order the jerk chicken (I tried a sample and felt incinerated) but dining companions have raved about it as a rice bowl.  My son adores the carnitas in a burro with chicken fried rice and black beans.  Tonight, I took out a combo:  emerald chicken quesadilla, Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla, pork fried rice, black beans, and a snickerdoodle.  This will be dinner tonight with plenty left over for the dog.  Total bill was under $9.  And the snickerdoodles are GOOD!  They're the same taste as my great-grandmother's were, but they're WAY bigger (a good thing).

Ambience?  There is none.  It's strictly Costco plastic buffet tables with folding chairs and a concrete floor.  But who cares?  If you're taking it out, you've got to create your own ambience, anyway.  If you're eating in, you'll be paying way too much attention to your food (and that of your companions and neighbors) to bother worrying.  I also think the name is just too cool.  I am a huge fan of the politically incorrect, and \"Takee Outee\" rules!

Finally, the location could not be worse - it's hidden in an obscure strip mall behind the Walgreen's on Chandler Boulevard and Dobson.  However, if you want to try it out, FIND it QUICKLY.  A posting on the door advised that Chino Bandito will be featured on Food TV's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on April 7.  When Matt's Big Breakfast was featured last month, the wait times there tripled, so it's likely you'll be fighting crowds by the end of next week.

4/2/08 EDIT:  It turns out that my order from last night was wrong.  WAY wrong.  I called to let them know, and they told me to come in tomorrow and they'll redo the whole thing.  Score!!"}
{"text":"If you Haven't been here, go ASAP. it's a Phoenix staple.
I have been eating here since High School !!! Great local owners and they now have a 2nd Scottsdale location. YAY.
They have a tasting station at the front, so first timers can figure out what they like before committing to something.  Face it there is nothing like it anyplace. Chinese food fused with Mexican food, has proved to be a match in business and in love.
The Phoenix location has had pics of \"chino Kids\" for as long as I can remember and  the pics go back a long way so its a neat retrospective. Love it when somebody in their 20's+ says \"hey that's me \" and points at some kid on the wall.  
Go for the Jade red chicken , you can have it breaded or not. I have mine on salad in place of rice.  The jerk chicken and rice is another don't miss item. You can have anything put on a quesadilla if you would rather have portable food , just ASK ! 
An Awesome Phoenix and now Scottsdale institution"}
{"text":"Self described hole in the wall.  Order at counter, seat yourself, food delivered to your table.

Average Food Cost/person:
$8

Recommend:  
Free Snickerdoodle
Jerk Chicken
Jerk Fried Rice
Salsas

Skip:  Chile Relleno - more like tempura batter
White Rice

Tips:  

1.  Majority of the dishes are fried. Their most popular dish Jade Chicken is essentially sweet and sour with a spicy kick. My Pollo Diablo was extremely oily. 

2.  Ordering process a little confusing.  To the left is the line to sample 6 items before you commit to something. It is separate from the order line to your right. 

3.  They give you a free cookie when they deliver the food."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant every time I am in town. Obsessed with their food, I cannot get enough of it."}
{"text":"Although the prospect of mixing Chinese and Mexican cuisines together may raise some eyebrows in a skeptical fashion, I can honestly say that boldly diving into a two combo plate from this place will NOT leave you disappointed. A decent selection of bottled beers and wine are also available.

Chino Banditos's is an impressively unique place to chow down on your midday lunch hour. The portions of food you get for around 10 bucks will take your hunger and beat it  in the face with a nine iron. However, I wouldn't say that everything on the menu is 100% perfect, but what they do make well, they make phenomenally well. For example, while their re-fried beans may not be anything special, but their black beans are sweet, tangy, and absolutely delicious! I've tried just about everything on the menu and the jen red and hengrenade chicken items are fantastic and bursting with flavor.

Another great feature of the place is how well they guide newcomers through their menu and ordering system; attributing to their fine customer service. Free samples are all available on request for just about everything on the menu, so \"try before you buy\" definitely wins this place some brownie points too since it'll help determine what you might like the most to make that first meal there AWESOME.

All in all, the food, service, and generous portions all contribute to a solid and DELICIOUS work lunch. If your feeling a little adventurous and want something totally different, but just a tad familiar, you can't go wrong with Chino Bandito's."}
{"text":"So this is honestly my first time here and it was good. Walked in and ordered the jade chicken and it was really good. I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the fuss is about the food here is mediocre at best. I got a burrito with jade chicken. The chicken was kind of dry the rice was so so the burrito was good though, mine had pork in it (carnitas). But is this the best Chinese food/Mexican food i have had? no way this place is over hyped in my opinion just your average sub par take out place to me."}
{"text":"Got the combo jerk chicken and rice .....bomb... Everything I had here was great!!! And priced well!!!"}
{"text":"You'll find no fusion wankery here, just a good old fashion blend of two tasty cuisine. If you're visiting Phoenix this is a must do, it's an experience you'll remember and savour. Oh, and everyone gets a free cookie! Beers are pretty cheap too. Try all their in house sauces."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, delicious food, and cheap prices! What more can you ask for? We have taken every out-of-towner to this place to eat, and they all have loved the food, decor, and friendly staff. They are great about giving samples of about 6 different items from the menu, and they help fill out your order card as well. Everything tastes really fresh, and they have a ton of options. They're also great about substituting items as well. Definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"Let's admit it: this place is neither Chinese nor Mexican.  Not that I have a problem with that.  I just see it as another Panda Express or Baja Fresh - good ole American fast food.  I have been here twice and the food has been good both times.  I have now tried: jade red chicken, emerald chicken, machaca, carnitas, cuban black beans, refried beans, and pork fried rice.  My favorites are the jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  On my second visit, the food was a little salty, but again, this is American fast food.  The snickerdoodle cookie is also a nice touch.  I need to be sure to make it one day for their volcano cookie.  Portions are big enough to have leftovers for another meal.  This is granted that I always pick quesadilla for one of my combo choices.  Service has been good on both visits even though all the workers seem a little young.  They were friendly, helped with the menu, and gave samples for first timers.  I have to admit, $10 for a combo + drink is high for a fast food joint, but somehow, I know I will be going back.  Oh yeah, for $10, they can do better than plastic lawn chairs and tables."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The place is ok but not 4 and 5 starts like what's been posted here. Service was good, food was good but not 4-5 stars. It's not a place I've returned too after eating their twice."}
{"text":"Such a guilty pleasure.

I had heard about this strange little fusion eatery long before some friends finally dragged me there.  Now I make up for lost time by spreading the wealth... oh, and returning often.

A unique a-la-carte selection of Chinese, Korean, Mexican, Cuban treats served in almost as many styles.  A machaca rice bowl? Yes.  A sweet & spicy chicken burrito?  Yes.  A jerk chicken quesadilla?  My favorite.  Basically, worldwide Dim Sum on a foil plate.

The ordering process can be quite intimidating to the unintiated.  The staff is more than willing to help and even offers a tutorial with samples, but they're got their hands full during the lunch rush.  Take a repeater with you, or target a slower period for your first time.

Unfortunately Chino has had to raise prices a bit.  I've scaled back some of my orders, but I occassionally cross into that $$ mark.

Oh, yeah.  I'd go for the snickerdoodle any day of the week."}
{"text":"I came here after much hype having seen it on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives and some other top 100 restaurants show on the Travel Chanel. Over hyped. The food was OK and not what they had made it seem to be. The snicker-doodle was good, but no one goes there just for that. The place itself is a little dirty and sketchy with its plastic tables and chairs, this is defenatly a take-out place rather than a sit-down place, or \"takee-outee\" as their sign suggests.  I like the idea of Chinese and Mexican fusion, but here it's not executed well. There's a sit-down restaurant on 15th Ave & Indian School called Red Dragon (formerly Daily Buffet), they too fuse Chinese and Mexican though not the same format as Chino's; here you can order individual items off the menu or pay for the buffet around lunchtime and pick and choose from the Chinese hot table and Mexican hot table...so Chino isn't alone in the fusion idea. For now I'll give Chino Bandido 3 stars and doubt I would be back."}

The food is excellent the customer service is great!  Where can you go and get an excellent meal than be treated to a free cookie for dessert?  Only at Chino Bandido can you get this service!.   They have the perfect twist in combining Mexican and Asian cuisine.  I love the Veggie Quesadilla   We have been going here for over 20 years and the food is delicious.  I am a very picky eater and this food satisfies my pallet every time.   The place is busy all the time, and you can see why, once you try their delicious meals."}
{"text":"I may have liked it if I got the food I ordered! When my husband brought our food home we discovered that both of our orders were wrong. The only item right was the rice, which was good. The pork I got (but didn't order) was good, the chicken was wrong (thankfully that was what hubby wanted) and I wanted refried beans, not black. I couldn't even eat the black beans - I didn't like the taste at all. The chicken he got, neither one of us liked. He also ordered a quesadilla but didn't get it. 
Hubby really likes the place and raved about it but it didn't make a great first impression on me. I had seen it on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and had high hopes. 
I understand when a place is busy that things get mixed up but getting the wrong food order drives me nuts!

It was delicious! The customer service was on point! This friendly girl helped us out with ordering and also let us sample the six most popular items on the menu. Now that really helped me decide.
I ordered the red jade chicken and carnitas combo with the pork fried rice and black beans. It was so good!!!  All of the combination of favors- Asian and mexican is one great combo. I order a quesadilla for my son and they accidentally made it with the wrong meat- the guy let's me choose a whole new order and.... It was on the house!!! So I had ordered the same combo but this time the red jade chicken in a quesadilla.... One of the best quesadillas I've had! And I'm from San Francisco where they've got bomb ass Mexican food!!! 
This place was great, and with each order you get a free cookie. The place is in a tiny strip mall and it's practical but very clean. Customer service was just as good as the food!
When I come back to Phoenix, I'm def hittin this place up again!!"}
{"text":"Just about the most delicious, terrible-for-you food you'll ever eat. The first time I went I fell so in love that I went back the next day for lunch, which did a number on my digestive system, but I digress. A fantastic treat on those days when you need comfort food."}
{"text":"I used to love Chinos. However, the last three or four times we've been here we have been very disappointed. The portion sizes have decreased significantly and some dishes are nothing like they used to be. One example is the Jerk Fried Rice. It used to be spicy and have that jerked seasoning, but now it is almost flavorless. When we asked them what happened and all they said was \"Yep  that's our jerk fried rice\". They didn't care that we we not happy and didn't seem to care about any feedback. Too bad. This was a wonderful unique place and now it isn't anything special anymore. 

On another note I do think that the owners that established this gem have retired and sold Chinos which explains why there are so many changes. Perhaps if there is enough feedback the new owners will bring back the original recipes, anyways I think this place will end up who knows where. We miss you Chinos."}
{"text":"A casual dining experience where the cuisine is a mix of chinese and mexican.  They allow tastings beforehand which was a nice idea and the food is cheap.  The combination of the mexican and chinese food didnt do it for our group."}
{"text":"The most unique place in Phoenix (land of the chain restaurant). A friend tipped me off to this place about a year after I moved here and it is far and away my favorite place in the valley. I can't come up with a single complaint, delicious food, friendly and helpful staff (free samples of items if you're a first timer trying to decide), a huge plate of food for the price and they even sell beer! This is the first place I take anyone who comes to visit and they usually wind up wanting to eat here again before leaving!"}
{"text":"I fully expected to be let down from after reading all the hype online.  I wasn't.  While I still can't really describe all the different types of food, it doesn't matter.  My taste buds were confused...but happy.  Right when we walked in, the dude was really excited to see us.  He gave us samples of what was popular, as well as what he liked.  VERY good service to match the food.  Change up your routine, and give this place a try."}
{"text":"My first trip to Chino's was the night of my Bachelorette party. The Jade Red Chicken changed my life. I believe there were a few police officers eating in the dining room with us - but I could be mistaken. It was a party dedicated to getting me drunk, so who knows. I do know that I have been back many times since and also LOVE the Emerald Chicken in a quesedilla."}
{"text":"When I am in town, this is a must have. Smother me in Cuban black beans and call me Jeff Foxworthy, cause I am getting redneck with it. But seriously, cuban black beans, jerk fried rice, and diablo chicken is all you need to say. Skip the fancy ordering."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chino's since 1988 and, although the food is still good, the place is beyond filthy!  Yes, its casual atmosphere is part of its charm, but really, it's borderline call the Health Department disgusting.  The floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks and you can carve your name in the grease build-up on the tables."}
{"text":"Let me say first & foremost that the food at Chino's is fantastic & that you will be hard-pressed to find more bang for your buck considering the amount of yummy stuff you get for $9 (2 main dishes, sides of rice & beans, & a snickerdoodle cookie). The catch is that you have to keep reminding yourself of how good the food will be while you are waiting in line behind so many people that act like they have never been there before. You would think a bus full of Disneyland tourists just unloaded based how people act when they're trying to figure out what to order. Last night there was a group in front of me with two women, each with a spouse with big ideas on how to change the orders around, and one with a grandmother with a coupon who also wanted to split the tab in two. THIS WAS ALL IN THE SAME GROUP. Another patron in front of me asked the grandmother if they had been there before, and she happily replied, \"yes, but it's been a long time.\" Maybe CB has added a few items recently, but I have coming been here for 5 years & have ordered the same favorites & the menu looks identical to me. I had ordered over the phone (highly recommend doing this), and I could see my order on the shelf with my name on it when I showed up 5 minutes later...that's how fast things can go if the tourists weren't holding everything up! I expected the place to be packed just before closing on a Saturday night, but it was only the troublesome group and one other patron and me in the line. At least when I got home and took a bite I remembered why CB was a good choice despite how confused the other customers get trying to place an order. :)"}
{"text":"This is a fast food place that fuses Mexican and Chinese food. I am not a fan of sweet refried beans. The carnitas had the distinct taste of refrigerator.  The quesadilla filled with the jerk chicken was pretty good.  But overall not something I would return to."}
{"text":"Always been  a huge Chinos fan.  Have been going to the original N. Phx location for years, since the early 1990's.   Have been a regular since the Chandler location opened.  Know the owners personally .. RIP Frank.  have nothing but praise for the concept, the flavors and the service (until recently that is...) 

Unfortunately, the Chandler location seems to have gone through a bit of staff turnover as of late.  They're understaffed at lunchtime, the wait for your food is incredibly long, to the point that it's frustrating.  They're losing their 'mojo' as Warren P. so eloquently put it :(  Makes me sad to see. 

When you can see your order sitting under the heatlamps for 10mins and no one brings it out to you?  frustrating.. 

This has happened previously only at night, or slow times mid-afternoon.... which is somewhat excusable.. but  now at lunch?   

Also had to help another patron with the menu.. no one bothered to give them the free samples and walk them through the menu (first timers used to get this sort of treatment!? hopefully this was also just an oversight??) 

Here's to hoping they read these reviews and correct the problem.  At over $10 for lunch, it needs to be darn fresh, hot and service great to keep me as a regular."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! I highly recommend this place as you can pick and choose a ton of combinations and the flavors are awesome! I recommend the jade red chicken and the machaca.  Great overall place for delicious food."}
{"text":"I went to this place when it was mildly busy and the service was great, they gave us samples and they were kind and served with a smile on their face. The set-up was interesting and the facility wasn't exactly fancy, but didn't really impact my opinion on the experience. Who knew that a Chinese-Mexican fusion would make such a good meal? The food was great. I was a huge fan of the jerk chicken which was excellent in the cheese quesadilla. Tip: if you aren't a spicy type of person put the chicken or pork in the quesadilla. It takes away from the kick but doesn't take away from the flavor. I have never liked the texture of beans in general but the way that Chino prepared them made me a fan. Nice flavor, nice texture. The beef was very tender and very tasty like a roast, I didn't place it in a burrito or quesadilla, it wasn't spicy. The only thing I didn't like was the rice. I got the jerk rice and it was ok, didn't eat any of it. Overall, any traveler should come here when in Arizona or if you are a local and didn't come, it is a real treat, go."}
{"text":"Sounds crazy, but the modt Amazing fusion of my two favorite things. Chinese and mexican food. Dang! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"best chinese style bbq pork I have ever tried rice is awesome"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chinos since I was in elementary school before the Chandler location existed. We would go once a week growing up. Once I moved to Tempe for school, I was having some serious Chinos withdrawals until finally they opened the Chandler location. For a while, it was hit or miss with the food and It seemed that the Chandler location was the red headed step child. The recipes weren't being followed as closely as they should. I made the necessary calls to the Phx location about the questionable jade red chicken that tasted more like a ketchup chicken and after that, the chandler location seemed to get better. Until last week, the staff was rude and the red pens to write down my order disappeared and when I casually asked what happened to the red pens, the 16 year old manning the cash register gave me a dirty look and said 'I dunno?' -which wasn't a big deal, aside from chinos having red pens my entire life. It's just a way of life at chinos. You wrote down your order on the piece of paper with the red pen and then you come up w a funny name for the order. And the whole place kind of smelled like sewer which isn't ideal when you are eating. Anyway, the food didn't taste up to par either. It wasn't bad- it just didn't taste the same as it always has. I love chinos to the moon and back but someone needs to take a closer look at the Chandler location and stop letting it fall too far from the tree."}
{"text":"I use to love this place when my coworkers introduced me to this place in 2004.

Such a neat concept, fusion of Chinese and Mexican food. Who would've thought to combine crazy combinations like Emerald chicken in a quesedilla? Or bbq pork in a burrito with fried rice?

If you have never been here, they offer a sampling station of all the different ingredients they offer. Think of it as a coscto sampling, but all combined in one stop.

After you know what the ingredients are, it's the ordering that's fun.

The menu is on a single piece of paper, different sections: Make your combo, rice bowl, sides, and drinks.

I would highly recommend doing the combo, as it lets you choose 2 ingredients, beans, and rice. Basic art of building your combo is to first choose the meat you want ( you get 2 choices). My favorite is the emerald chicken (its minced ginger/green onino and chicken, very good) and the jade red chicken (Lightly coated, deep-fried chicken glazed with slightly spicy sweet sauce). There's other choices such as jerk fried chicken, carnitas, chile relleno, hengrenade chicken, teriyaki chicken, etc.

After you choose the meat, you choose whether to have it wrapped in a burrito or quesadilla (they use the wok to pan fry it). I usually do one of the meats in a quesadilla and the other by itself.

Then you choose the beans (refried or black beans) and the rice (plain rice is included, fried rice extra $).

That's it! Then you put your drink and the name you want to be known as. I've heard of many folks putting hilarious names, but I haven't had the guts to try that yet.

The taste is very good in my opinion, but tends to be a bit on the greasy side. 

However in the past few years, I noticed their portions are getting smaller and the price increasing. So haven't gone as much as before, hence I'm giving this place a 3 star. It definitely is a neat concept and lunchtimes are always packed with people. Worth a try if you want to try some new crazy fusion Chinese/Mex food.

PS: This was the original Chino Bandido location, so the place looks a  bit more dumpy than the one in Chandler.

{"text":"Innovative food, taste great. 

Down side is this place is horrifically dirty, that in itself makes me reluctant to eat here often."}
{"text":"I love this place. Here are some of the finer points of this establishment. The food is great. Every single entree that i have tried has been fantastic. I am personally a huge fan of their black bean tostadas. Unfortunately, these are only available on the weekends, though. The place itself is VERY casual, but who cares. The food speaks for itself. Also, the staff was always nothing but helpful and friendly when I lived in the area. We were on a first name business for some time. 

A few of the drawbacks for me was the location. It was a bit of a hike for myself, but worth it. Also, I no longer eat chicken, beef or pork, so my options are quite limited. There is not a bountiful selection for vegetarians. However, the beans are fantastic."}
{"text":"The guy taking my order was just terribly rude with no sense of humor, I wasn't impressed with the concept and the crazy hype with the mix of foods, I rather eat both separate and it think that is better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Much beloved Chino Bandido deserves whatever reputation it has. The food is weird, greasy, yet overall wonderful.

Through visits once to twice a month, we have tried about 2/3 of the menu and established a kind of rotation of winners. Some dishes I much prefer to others, but I can also see different people liking the exact opposite dishes.

Our consolidated tips for success: Try a combo with the refried black beans, jerk chicken fried rice, and at least one of your entree choices in a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Simple and inexpensive food that I will certainly make a detour for every time I am in Phoenix.  

I went with a large group of friends and family and tried nearly all of the options (all of which I would recommend).  

Staff were professional. Service was quick. Prices were fair. Would highly recommenced."}
{"text":"We love Chino Bandido! This location is really hard to find if you haven't been there before. We usually get a variation of the jerk chicken in quesadillas or something."}
{"text":"Just visited Phoenix and ate here for the first time. The service and food was so outstanding I knew I had to write a review. My cashier was extremely friendly and helpful. I got the #7 and #1 combo with jerk fried rice. Don't bother getting 5 star restaurant wait times when you could eat here and get better, unique food at an amazing price and casual atmosphere. I plan on eating here all 7 nights of my trip because of the diverse menu."}
{"text":"If you've ever craved a mashup of vaguely Mexican and even more vaguely Chinese foods served in an aluminum to-go bowl with ample grease and a delicious bonus cookie (Like you need even MORE calories at this point! (You do, though.)) then Chino Bandido is your place.  Where else in town can you get Americanized Chinese foods in a quesadilla?  The black beans are magical, and the cookies are always chewy and fresh.  Unfortunately, my favorite emerald chicken quesadilla seems to be the soppiest item on the menu.  I think combining greasy chicken with greasy cheese is probably not the wisest choice.  Tastiest, though.

Lately I've noticed the food seems to be a lot heavier with grease than it used to be, so I think limiting Chino outings to a quarterly or semi-annual affair is probably smart.  My last visit left me a wee bit comatose and with the urge to hit the gym once I'd recovered.  Definitely not healthy fare at all, but if you go to a greasy spoon and order a vegetable/salad type thing, you're kind of an idiot anyway.  This isn't the place for that behavior."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken. Enough said. I like it as a burrito but you can have it your way. Eat love it, go back for more."}
{"text":"We found this place through Food Networks Diners, Drive-In and Dives. We really enjoyed it. The service was fast and friendly during a lunch time crowd. We had Jade Chicken and the Jerk Chicken. The Jerk Chicken was ok but better suited for someone who really likes a strong Jerk seasoning. The Jade Chicken was listed as the Favorite and we agree. The Jade chicken had a great combination of spicy and sweet flavors. The portions were excellent. This place could make a 5 star rating if they could keep the tables clean a little better, fresh coat of paint on the walls and nicer tables. However all of this stuff added to the \"dive\" feeling. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I dont get it. Heres a clue, if you need to have a full instruction page on your website and a clerk to explain how to order, you're trying to hard.

Uh, number 7B, no, 7Q, no, uh um..... Whaaaa?????? Just totally stupid. And I have tried this place 3 times to try and figure out why the hell anyone would want to eat chinese mexican fusion???? I even brought people with me to try to figure out if it is me..... Its not, this place blows on all levels.... That allspice or whatever they put in the jerk chicken that everyone raves about is terrible...... An now its chinese mexican jamaican fusion?????? WTF is this crap? Fried rice and black beans?????? How is this good?

It blows..... it simply blows..... Amazing fusion? really?????"}
{"text":"i love this place. a friend of mine in college turned me onto it and i have been coming here for years now. i always bring out of town guests/new people here. the look of when you tell them \"yeah its chinese/mexican throws them off quite a bit.

the food is great! i always eat too much and leave feeling ridiculously full. the combination of chinese/mexican works amazingly well. the jade red chicken is pretty much their staple item. i normally always get that in some form, and usually their emerald chicken. their snickerdoodle cookies are amazing too. first timers you can sample all the items before making your decision too. their staff is very helpful for new people who have not been there or ordered before.

price is right. not very expensive but you get a ton of food for your money spent. if you come here on a friday night it will most likely be super busy. be prepared to wait a little bit to get your food. other than that i have no complaints."}
{"text":"The black beans are awesome. Also recommend the jerk fried rice. Actually, everything I've had here has been good. Free snickerdoodle with every order. Oh, and the salsa is yummy too."}
{"text":"It's not uncommon in certain areas to see an off combination of foods in the same eating establishment; Chinese restaurants serving BBQ or Mexican restaurants serving Fish & Chips. And, although the concept of combining Mexican & Asian cuisine on the same menu wouldn't be my first choice (I'd honestly pass up the option every time), I can honestly say that I'm glad I tried it.

Pro's:
- Inexpensive
- Food has exceptional flavor
- Free samples of what you want to order if you're a first-timer (every time could be your first)
- Decent amount of food for the amount of money you pay
- Simple enough menu to order from (though there aren't too many items, there's enough to make you want to try everything on the first try....at least it did for me....you don't want to order behind me, you'll be waiting and hungry. LOL)

Con's:
- Chandler location is hidden from traffic (there is absolutely NO signage on Chandler Blvd or Dobson Rd); it would appear that most, if not all, of their business comes from word or mouth and/or return customers
- The eating utensils were EXTREMELY flimsy. And, they only had spoons and chopsticks! Argh! Why no plastic forks? (Insert puzzled look here). Can I get a fork please. Geez! 
- The bathroom door entrances are an accident waiting to happen (it swings open in both directions AND directly across from each other. Man - woman exiting simultaneously...OUCH!)
- The overall feel of the establishment could use a makeover to make it more attractive (it has a cheesy cafeteria vibe going); if NOTHING else, they can stand to step their game up by updating the menu on the wall (tacky)

I'd like to give them 3 1/2 stars but, YELP only offers whole stars. Damn! Lol. Nonetheless, I'd still patronize the establishment.....To-Go please."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well! 

Way to Go!"}
{"text":"Weird mix of foods. Does not seem to mix well. The chicken was dry. Food was luke warm. Not the best enviroment to eat at. Honestly would much rather do taco bell."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SOOOO GOOD. Their food is incredible. I would have never thought Chinese and Mexican food could go together so well. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Jade chicken-Yummy!!!!!!!!! Loved all the food. 
Dining area a bit messy but food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"We flew into Phoenix from Jfk and looked for a place for lunch on our way north.  We were of course looking for something local but simple. 
We used our yelp app and ended up at the Chino Bandido.  The food was great.  It's a fusion of Mexican and Chinese, leaning toward the Mexican.  We walked in and were greeted with an offer for samples.  Each offering was a unique explosion of flavor and spice.   Great food and a really simple atmosphere. 
 You order up front at the counter and then grab your drink and head to a table.  The food is delivered on a tray in a tin pan, but you don't mind because after that first bite you're hooked. 
 It fit the bill and we left stuffed and with a smile on our faces."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that writing this review KILLS ME as I've been coming to Chino Bandido since I started grad school in Glendale in ~1996.  I have loved this place for its quirky menu, its totally casual atmosphere, great service and reasonable prices.  I've brought my young kids here for years and they love it too.

All of that said, I have to say that in the last year and a half the quality has declined DRAMATICALLY.  Specifically there seems to be a total lack of attention to detail.  The last three times we've been there it has been ehhh and tonight it was just flat out bad.  We got in the car and said that if that had been the first time we visited, we'd never come back.  As it is it'll be a long time before we eat here again.

Specifically the food on the last few visits has been cold, and I don't mean warm, I really mean cold like it's just been sitting ready to go and was just thrown in a foil plate and served at room temperature.  On top of being cold I had Jade Red chicken (#7) that was very dry and had very little of the red sauce on it so it just looked like chicken nuggets with a bit of red here and there.  Worse than that though was Hengrenade chicken that was cold, limp and just tasted steamed, not an ounce of browning on it.  In all, the worst meal I've eaten there and my wife's was just as bad.

Kills me to write this as I've written 5 star reviews for Chino and referred MANY people over the years who've universally loved it.  I must stress that the crew that works there couldn't be nicer, they are great kids, polite, helpful and this is not about them, this is about food that isn't a quarter as good as it was 5, 10 or 15 years ago.

I hope that I can go back in a few months and things will be better, if not I'm afraid we're done.  I saw that the owner's husband passed away a couple of years ago and that she has closed the Chandler location which I hope isn't an indication that this place is in a rapid decline leading to a slow painful closing.  I would happily amend this review if things improve and for their sake I hope that they do.  We both commented tonight that for a Friday night at 6:30 things were MUCH slower than normal so I suspect that we're not the only ones feeling this way.

Please, please, please focus on food quality.  I guarantee that no one checked temperature or presentation tonight before the food went out.  We get that this is not fine dining, but that's not an excuse for poor food quality.  Our food bore zero resemblance to the food pics on their Facebook page.   I want my favorite casual restaurant back......."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure whether to give two or three stars.  I read some of the other reviews and many people are spot-on with this place.  It is oddly located, in a small strip mall-type place with limited parking.  It is a large, empty-feeling restaurant with not much to look at.  

I have been here twice.  The first time I was greeted by a friendly girl who, upon learning that it was my first time, offered up samples and directions on how to order.  I found the food to be tasty and interesting but not wonderful.  My friend had the jerk chicken and was rewarded with the worst heartburn he's ever experienced.  He was up most of the night regretting that jerk chicken.  Needless to say we'll never order jerk again.

My second visit was several months ago.  I was \"greeted\" by an unenthusiastic guy who was just ready to take my order but offered no assistance.  I politely said, \"this is my second visit but it was so long ago that I was first here I don't remember how the combinations work...\"  I looked at him hopefully, willing him to explain a little to me.  He looked back at me, I guess hoping I would just order something.  I tried again to ask in a more direct way if he could explain the system to me, since it is complicated and no where does it explain to you exactly how to order.  If you just look at the menu it is confusing and I don't know exactly what I'm looking at.  He seemed annoyed and handed me a paper copy of their menu and sort of quickly explained a couple things.  I was in a hurry and at this point I just decided to order some things and see what happened.  Again, I had some food that was interesting but not wonderful.  It is like the first few bits are quite flavorful and tasty....then after a bit you start feeling like you don't want any more.  At least that is how I felt.  

I may not try it again here."}
{"text":"I love Chino's for the laid back good fast food it is. It isn't a place you go for impressions but to get good food, lots of it at a decent price. The food has always been good when I have been there and on Sat and Sun you get a free cookie with your meal, nice yummy fresh baked cookies!

I generally go for the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken and double Jerk Fried rice, a nice spicy meal for sure! 

They offer free tastes of their more popular items so you can make a good decision before ordering. 

Ordering is super easy, grab a paper and a pen and just fill in the blanks, and heck if you screw it up, no worries they always make sure you get the right stuff."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location for over sixteen years, and I still love Chino Bandidos. The Jade Red Chicken and the Jen Red Pork are my favorite sweeter items while the Jerk Chicken and the El Pollo Diablo are my favorite spicy items.

Their black beans are unlike any other black beans. I think they all them Cuban Black Beans or Caribbean Black Beans, but that is not important. Even if you prefer pinto beans over black beans, you have to try their black beans at least once.

Note that if you are trying to do a low-carb diet, you can strikeout (put a line through) the rice and bean options and write \"veggies\" instead on the combination. That way you get a combo bowl with broccoli, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese instead of the rice and beans. 

Another ordering tip. If you want black beans in your burrito you put two 'B's instead of one. For example if you I wanted a jerk chicken burrito with black beans in it with my combo, you would write 9BB instead of 9B."}
{"text":"Everytime I leave here, I regret it.

Yet in a few days, all I do is crave it.

As long as you aren't afraid of gut-bombing, coma-inducing, delicious Asian-Mexican Fusion, I recommend Chino Bandido with much enthusiasm.  Why is this not a combination more often seen is the question I beg to ask.

The decorum itself is dive-ier than dive, in fact, it resembles a soup kitchen more than a restaurant, but what it lacks in outward appeal, it more than makes up for in tummy-warming, lip-smacking, mmmmhmmmmmm-inducing goodness.

For food, I love the Jade Red Chicken and the Pollo Diablo in a Burrito (ask for black beans + Jerk Fried Rice in the burrito too!).  If you are unsure what you want, there are samples ready to be shared so that you can try out any of the menu's delicious items.  The black beans here must have illicit drugs in them because they are so addictive and the jerk fried rice is a perfect accompaniment.

Highly recommended, love this place, going to head there now!"}
{"text":"I feel pretty comfortable saying that this was the best Chinese-Mexican food that I've ever had.  I opted for the combo bowl and that enabled me to enjoy both the Chinese and Mexican flavors with every bite.  I now know that re-fried black beans and Jade Red Chicken are a natural combination.  The Emerald Chicken was also very good, as was the pork fried rice.  

For those of you who haven't been to the Bandido before, the ordering process isn't too difficult to grasp.  Not only will the employees hold your hand while you order, they're also eager to give you samples of many of the dishes.  This way if you aren't sure if you want an Egg Foo Young in a burrito or Chinese BBQ Pork in a quesadilla, you can make an informed decision.  

The combo was really too much food.  Nevertheless, the complimentary cookie for dessert was a good way to end my Chino Bandido experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for as long as I can remember, since I was a kid. I've always loved it. I moved out of Arizona but whenever I'm in town I always try to make it to chino. Always get the jade red chicken and black beans, and their Snickerdoodles are always big and super soft. 

Can't wait to come back to Phoenix, and back here."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! The chandler location is never crowded... Had a big group of friends with no problem. They let you sample everything, even the cookies. It seems like you can't go wrong with any of the choices ... I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I remembered seeing this restaurant on the food network show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and thought very interesting at the time. Checked it out last night when I got into town and was not disappointed. I had a two meat bowl with JEN RED PORK, chicken fried rice and CHINESE B-B-Q PORK stuffed in a great flour tortilla and a cookie for dessert.  I come to Phoenix for a week every month and would come back again."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before and my co worker brought me, Chinese and Mexican food, I'm in! The ordering was weird and the whole restaurant seemed a bit unkempt and disorganized.   Food was great, I had the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla with Pork fried Rice and black beans, very good!  The snicker doodle at the end was awesome!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! If you haven't been here before just let them know and you can sample their most popular dishes before you order. Quick service and the cookies are to die for"}
{"text":"I loved them when they first opened.  Used to see the owners all the time  Great people, miss seeing them when I go.  When owners where there the quality and flavor was always perfect.  Still great food, just not 5 stars like it used to be, hoot or miss between 4 and 5 stars.  Wonder of the original owners are still involved or passed the business their children etc..."}
{"text":"We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \"wow, thats tasty\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Thought I would give it a try I mean I am a chinese food fan and a mexican fan. So. What's the worst that could happen. 

The place is pretty non descript making me moderately question For a split second the quality of the establishment. But before I could bat an eyelash the service people there were fantastic and nice, just wonderful. Couple that with free samples of amazing food and we have a winner. (The fastest way to a mans heart they say). 

Now the food was in a realm of its own. The chicken was good quality it wasn't that 18lbs of breading crap some chinese restaurants claim to be actual meat. The black beans were also something that reminded me of home. But with a little extra zing. The jerk rice was fantastic with spices of asian flavor with Caribbean yummy ness. 

All things considered I ordered food. And more to go. 

SHOUT OUT TO THE EMERALD CHICKEN IN MY TOGO BOX RIGHT NOW. I'm gonna eat you. And I'm gonna love you.... Don't wince. It's gonna happen.... Nomnomnom"}
{"text":"Jade Red Chicken is great.  Orange Chicken quesadilla is great as well.  That's right.  Asian + Mexican cuisine (I use that loosely) all in one!  Grease for days."}
{"text":"We were visiting from LA, and tried to do a few restaurants featured on DDD.  Since we were close to Chandler, we hit this location rather than the original Phoenix location, but the food and concept was the same so it's all good.

I was actually surprised how much we ended up liking this place.  My wife had the Emerald (Ginger) chicken and egg foo young combo bowl, and I had the Jade chicken and Emerald combo bowl.

It's been written many times before how this place works, so there's not much to add other than the food is actually really really good.  All white meat chicken, the flavors were good, and the Jade chicken was the shizzle.

DDD joints are sometimes hit or miss, but this was a hit.  Nice people, good food.  It was really empty on a Friday evening, though, so I hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Sweet fancy Moses, this place is a dump.  I bought my last wardrobe at a thrift store that had a better aesthetic.  Dumpy tables, dirty walls, and Sweet Lord that bathroom.

$5000 bucks of the Diner Drive-inns and Dives money would completely change the vibe here.

BUT we go to Chino for the grub, and it's crazy tasty.  Emerald chicken, jade chicken, egg foo yummy.

Big bowls of tasty foods with unique flavor profiles, that's the Chino experience.

Just watch the sewage in the parking lot...."}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience! Fabulous Jade Red/Teriyaki combo bowl - unlike anything I've ever tried. Ambience is outstanding, and such a wonderful team. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Definitely try the emerald chicken, jade red chicken, pork fried rice and black beans. The ordering is definitely different, but it's not complicated. What this place lacks in ambience it completely makes up in taste. Looks like they even recently remodeled their bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Sorry we were so looking forward to eating here as we have visited their other location & loved the food, unfortunately after a 40 min wait & still no food we along with other patrons asked for a refund & left. Not sure what's going on here as we watched the kitchen help through the window & they appeared untrained confused & clueless. Not sure if the chef quit & they were trying to improvise but I've never had to leave a restaurant hungry. So sad"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have the best food, their customer service is amazing. I ordered from them through a third party delivery service who messed up my order completely. I called back and spoke to Jimmy who I am assuming is the manager, and he fixed everything and then some even though it wasn't their fault. What more could you want, amazing food and outstanding customer service. It would be impossible for you to eat at this place and be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has such an unique ethnic fusion. I love the carribean jerk rice and the black refried beans. Everything I have ever gotten here was excellent. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Three of us lunched. waitress gave us samples since we were first timers. The meals were prompt, and they were not so expensive. My meal consisting egg foo young w/ red chicken and black bean was so so. I have had much better chinese than this. My friends had red chiken, friend rice, and pulled pork. They said they were ok. Do I go back......maybe one year later."}
{"text":"Eating at Chino Bandido is not just dinner it's an adventure!  When you mention it is your first time dining at Chino Bandido a friendly staff member will give you the \"tour of taste\" allowing you to sample nearly all of there meats.  They will also explain to you all of the different ways that you can order up your meal and if the order sheet is too confusing they will even fill it out for you.

Yes, Chino Bandido is a hole in the wall (One of the reasons it is so cool.). Yes the food is fatty (In a good way, it's Chinese/Mexican for crying out loud). Yes, the name is funny (Chino Bandido takee-Outee).  Yes, my friends and I had to take  a picture with the giant panda in a sombrero but you should too!"}
{"text":"I visted this restaurant several months ago after moving here from los angeles. I had heard good things from residents and from online reviews. Also it was conveniently right down the street from my place. 

I expected a lot because of all the hype but was immediately let down as soon as we walked in the restaurant.  It was dirty and run down. You would think with all the publicity this place get its would tidy up but nope, beedln to cleaner looking restaurants in south central la.

Most importantly the food sucked so bad that I actually made yelp account to let people know that its bad. This is not authentic mexican nor is it Chinese food. The was dry the beans were canned, the carnitas were also dry.  So sad that I cant find good food out hete in phoenix.  To be honest if people like this restaurant then they just have never had authentic mexican or Chinese food in there life. Try for your self but be honest. Dont give it a review based on the hype or because you saw it on the food next work. Don't go on a day your are too hungry though, the disappointment will be greater."}
{"text":"Love this dive place! Get the 10/7 combo (Emerald Chicken and Jade Red chicken) with black beans. To die for! Cookie is a nice touch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Chino never disappoints. The first time my friend told me about how Chino is Mexican and Chinese cuisine together sounded very odd. First time I ate here I had the Jade Red Chicken in a quesadilla, and for eight years have gotten the same thing. The rice and black beans are amazing. The portions are big enough to share. Besides the entree, the cookie they give you is to die for. Every time I bring a friend, they always want to come back. Even though it is on the other side of town, it is worth it."}
{"text":"this is a good dive! chinese mexican fusion cant go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"The mexican-chinese fusion food is delicious. It's unique combinations works well, with the diablo & jerk chicken my favorite. Their own take on quesadillas which are basically cheese crisps filled with meat r total comfort food. Don't forget to get the cookies, good way to finish off a meal here."}
{"text":"I love going to this place! It's the perfect combination of both Mexican and Asian food. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is willing to try something new!"}
{"text":"The first time I head about Chino Bandito I thought to myself \"Mexican and Chinese?  Eww...\"  After eating there, I was blown away with how good the food is and how well they go together.  The food is very full of flavor without being overly spicy...and there are so many combinations that you can create that it never gets boring eating there.  While the place has a kinda 'hole in the wall cafeteria' feel to it...the really cool sculpture of the giant panda and the panda bandit art on the wall makes up for it.  Definitely should be on your list of places you have to visit if you're vacationing in Phoenix...and if you live here...Make it a weekly visit.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of my favorite local local spots. 

Upon arriving, you'll come to the conclusion you might want to turn around. The parking lot is spooky, the restaurant boasts elementary school floor tile and fold-up plastic card tables.

Don't let this fool you. The food here is top dog. The service is hit or miss, really- but the food! The food is like a little Chinese-Mexican warrior came down from space to bless us all with delicious jade red chicken, quesadillas, burritos, nummy rice, mouth-watering cookies (which don't taste half bad dipped into their BLACK BEANS, if your into the savory, sugary thing). 

I couldn't say more good things about Chino's food: what restaurants are all about. I could care less if the bathrooms are tight and smell a little funky. The food is great. That's what we care about. 

It's an original, local staple that has been and will be passed down for generations."}
{"text":"I'm sure there are a lot of lovely people who've eaten at Chino Bandido before, but some of them evidently don't know what awesome tastes like.  Because it tastes like Chino Bandido.  First off, turns out anything in a quesadilla is better than anything outside of a quesadilla.  Spicy stuff, sweet stuff, it doesn't matter.  It's better with cheese.  Second, black refried beans.  Are you kidding me?  And third, why aren't I eating jerk fried rice right now?  Sob.  

If you're on a diet, stop right now.  Head over to Chino and get your grub on."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!"}
{"text":"More proof that the hole in the wall joints are the best. My favorites are the Henegrade Chicken, and Pollo Diablo. Many different options for rice which are quite tasty. Combo platter will also include beans. May not be the prettiest place to eat in the valley, but you will leave with a smile on your face. My only frustration with them is that they won't sell me more snicker doodles (most of the time) to take home. When I worked on Scottsdale Road, a large group of people were willing to travel 8 miles both ways every week to eat there. My favorite place in town to eat. They were featured on the Food network last year if you need more proof."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the food is amazing. It has just the right mix of heat (spice) and flavor. The price is certainly good too."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times.Greatest idea ever! Chinese and Mexican combos,two of my favorite types of food. Choose two chicken and/or pork dishes,then your beans and rice choices,last add quesadilla and/or burrito, all in one plate. Fantastic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have to admit, I've found that this is one of those places that people either love it or not, and I love it. Ordering is a little complicated but the staff will let you sample everything on the menu to make sure you get what you like. Love the carnitas quesadilla and the jade red chicken. The Jerk Fried Rice (JFR) is a must!!! You have to try it to see where you land, love or not. I love it!"}
{"text":"Really great.  I went because it looked good on DDD and it did not disappoint.  They staff was super friendly...\"you've never been here?   Let me give you a bunch of samples to see what you like\".  I recommend the Jade Chicken and the Jerk Fried Rice...awesome."}
{"text":"So I love Chinese food. I love Spanish and Mexican food. But so when I heard about this place needless to say I was excited. When my family and I walked in we were scared to sit down. The very poor sanitary conditions in the waiting area and dining area were only surpassed when my son need to use the rest room. I have been in cleaner 7-11's. Aside from the hard to understand menu and ordering system the wait for food was aweful. Three people in line before me and I wait fifteen minutes to order? Then another thirty minutes to get my food. So finally the food comes out we grab it and head to our home in he area. Less than ten minutes away. It was really bad. The pork in all my dishes was overlooked and dry with a hint of too dry to chew. The rice sides were poor to say the least. My wife and children hated all they got except for the small saving grace for my wife. The jade chicken burrito. That is the only reason that this place even received a second star. Very good flavor on hat one. If you want Chinese do not go here. If you want Mexican do not go here. Actually try to never go here unless you HAVE to have a jade chicken. Bring your own sanitizer. You will need it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I loved the service and the food was comforting! We shared a combination bowl and it filled us well but make sure to ask for help if your visiting for the first time because they will let you sample what they serve."}
{"text":"This is nothing close to Mexican food, I ordered a burrito that was grease and nasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!  The back beans are good enough to die for....seriously, they are that good.  Recommend the emerald chicken or the jerk chicken in a burrito or casa dia.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time yesterday despite having lived in the area for almost a year. My advice? Go. Go there right now. My life has been changed by this place, that's how good it was. No bells and whistles, easy, simple menu, and kind helpful staff. The food was delicious. Plus it's also super affordable (I got a combo meal for under ten bucks). I don't know what I was expecting, but I definitely wasn't expecting it to be that good. If recommend the #7 with white rice and refried beans. So. Good."}
{"text":"I have been going here sense I was a kid! They have the best food that is not comparable to anything else! It is a must try restaurant!! I always leave pleased :)"}
{"text":"Ate here multiple times on a Phoenix vacation. Super super good food, very friendly service helped us navigate the menus. This is probably my favorite restaurant I've ever eaten at, I can't recommend this place enough to get."}
{"text":"Out of all the years I've been coming here I've never been disappointed. Staples of Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken are consistently delicious and are unlike anything you can get anywhere else.  With fresh ingredients and a perfect snickerdoodle cookie to finish off every meal this place should be a definite stop for anyone in the area!!"}
{"text":"What we really liked at this restaurant were their black beans and their snickerdoodle cookies.  Every combo plate comes with a cookie but my family got an extra dozen more.  The food in itself was ok but what made it great was the novelty. Where else can you have combination  plates with Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican food .  From Jerk fried rice to whatever quesedilla, burrito meat and cuisine of your choice; Jade red chicken, carnitas, machaca or teriyaki chicken no problem.  There are so many different combinations you can make your way!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They let you sample a few things before you order and are very helpful with their suggestions. The jade red chicken is awesome with the plain rice with black beans! Also, their cookies are to die for."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but a bit greasy and overly salted. I like the Emerald Chicken the best. You can get a lot of food for not too much cash. My hands get almost slippery trying to hold a emerald chicken quesadilla from all the grease. The sugar cookies than come with all the meals are soft, but strangely salty? The restaurant itself is dirty (for example, when they mop, they miss the corners, so after doing this many times, the corners turn black). Take it to go if you want to try something new and don't mind the oily tortillas. No healthy options here!"}
{"text":"Jade red chicken, jerk chicken quesdilla, black beans, jerk fried rice. Don't question me. JUST. DO. IT. I crave this daily."}
{"text":"If you want bland, boring, tasteless food, head over to the Chino BLANDido, where you can feast on \"Chinese\" BBQ Pork and jerk fried rice that is as exciting as watching paint dry. All things considered I'd rather eat paint. No doubt it would have more flavor..."}
{"text":"This is one if my favorite places to eat. The perfect \"hole in the wall\", so if your expecting fancy, this place us not for you, but the food is fantastic. Love the Jerk Chicken and Jerk Rice. Very spicy!  Jade Chicken is the bomb. Love how you can make your own combo. They also make really tasty refried beans. Never had a bad dish and I have been a patron for loooong time. They have scrumptious cookies too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing fancy about this restaurant in a strip mall but the food was yummy! Truly a fusion type concept and not for the faint of heart as many of the dishes are pretty spicy. I loved the jerk chicken and black beans.

Ordering can seem confusing for a first timer but it will make sense after you watch others or ask for help.

No fuss, straight forward and good!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch during an afternoon because I bookmarked this place after seeing it on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dive TV show.  This place did not disappoint. Upon entering, a gal noticed that we were new to restaurant and offered to explain how we could order and gave us samples of their entrees.  Ordering was simple and from the time of paying by to getting the food on the table was 5 minutes.  Both meals were served hot. I had the Jade Red Chicken with pork fried rice and carnitas quesadilla. The Cuban black beans were tasty!  My friend had the El Diablo Chicken and shredded beef burrito,  the Cuban black beans and pork fried rice. He enjoyed his meal.  Overall, a great place with fast service.  When I come back to a Phoenix, I'd go here again."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips."}
{"text":"Oh, Chino Bandido--I do love your irreverent takee-outee. I've sampled most of your dishes and now have my favorites. I fill out my slip with Diablo Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans (extra Emerald sauce). 

As much as I love you, your entrees have slipped over the last couple years. The Diablo chicken has been a bit over-fried the last few times and lacking seasoning. The Emerald chicken (white meat, not fried) has been more than a tad dry. I still love you, but shape up, please. 

Jerk fried rice is consistent and, as always, yummy (especially with a little extra Emerald sauce mixed in!). The rock stars of the party are those mouthwatering black beans! I could stuff myself to the brim on those puppies. 

This DD&D joint isn't just a novelty. It is unique, delicious food in a crappy strip mall environment. No frills, but firefighters also love it (you know that's a good sign!). I'll also always love the complimentary snickerdoodle with every meal. 

I hope your entrees are just in a slump and will improve when the next cook takes over..."}
{"text":"I've only been to Chino a couple of times but I tell everyone I know about it! The food is SOOOOOOO good!!! I fell in love. My favorites thus far are the chicken with ginger (I forget what it's called) in a quesadilla and the red jade chicken. I tried a few different types of rice and they were delicious. oh and the cookies... YUM! Almost as perfect as Paradise Bakery's ;)

The only cons for me have been the service. First time I went there, it was great, the second time I brought my husband and the girl helping us had a serious amount of attitude which was very unpleasant. And she messed up our order, but we let that one slide. Not a huge deal.

So yeah the reason i'm not giving five stars is the inconsistency in the service, as well as the hard to find location/awkward parking lot, as well as the weird decor/vibe with picnic chairs and crappy silverware. The food is worth getting past those cons though - deeeelish!"}
{"text":"This is my second review of Chino - I went to the Chandler location last year, and my experience at the Phoenix one was very similar: hit and miss. When Chino is good, it is excellent. When it is bad, it sucks. I can understand the haters in these reviews - if you ordered a miss, you'd think the place was garbage. As far as entrees go, so far I've had pretty much 50-50 luck. In the excellent category: Jade Red Chicken (the best of all so far, sweet and wonderfully spicy), Emerald Chicken and Jerk Chicken. In the suck category: Chile Relleno: bland, undercooked and WAY TOO MUCH DEEP FRIED CRACKER CRUST... it really grossed me out. Hengrenade Chicken (DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE): would be more appropriately named \"Roasted Flavorless Chicken.\" Carnitas: remarkably bland, I mean this is pork for crying out loud.

The sides are uniformly delicious. Chino really seems to understand that sides actually matter. Their sides are so good (I've had the refried beans, plain fried rice and jerk fried rice and all are top notch) that they make up for the 50% entree suckage. The freshly made salsa they provide in abundance at the counter is flavorful and spicy, and excellent compliment to the beans and rice - and the entrees too for that matter. See my review of Los Taquitos below for an example of a place that does their sides and salsa EXACTLY OPPOSITE of Chino Bandido.

I again have to mention that the menu/ordering process is overly complicated. They seem proud of this, so I can't imagine it will change. The menu is so effing complicated that they have - get this - a \"menu simulator\" at their website. The thing is, it's actually useful. If you run the simulator menu-o-tron-3000 you will be able to go to the restaurant and order with confidence. Glory be. Me, I'd just as soon they dumb it down. 

Lots of people have remarked that the place wasn't clean. These people are probably those weird OCD types who sneeze into their elbows and take showers after every agonizing handshake. The place is grungy, which is not the same thing as dirty. It is in a crap strip mall at what could generously be described as not the nicest intersection in Phoenix - so exactly what you're expecting to see when you walk through its faded stucco facade is beyond me. But I got what I expected: a place that does as little with their decor as is necessary to get by. Dirty, however, it is not.

I will go back again, and I will make sure that eventually I get through the entire menu at Chino so that I will know what to tell my out of town friends and family to order at a place where they are sure to experience a very uniquely Phoenix dining experience."}
{"text":"Everything I would hope it would be!!  The person that helped us brought us several samples so we could pick exactly what we would enjoy which was wonderful since this was a one shot situation (we were on vacation).  Very unique and fun food experience.  The cookies tasted like sopapillas which was a fun suprise.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!! I heart this place and wish it was in Denver (or where ever I live).  YUMM!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it unless you like that I wish I hadn't feeling. Checked out because it was on DD&D's - will not go back. Over cooked over sugared food service Chinese , disgusting gloppy beans, facility itself is filthy."}
{"text":"So I've been back a bunch of times.  But I just have to add, their volcano cookies served only on weekends (or maybe every other weekend) are awesome, even better than the snickerdoodles.  Picture a brownie-like cookie, soft and gooey on the inside, covered with powdered sugar.  Awesome.

Still love their machacha beef, emerald chicken, and veggie quesadilla.  The chile relleno wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it being, I will not order that in the future."}
{"text":"Asian-Mexican fusion??? We HAD to check it out.
You pick your style, meat, rice and extras.  The actual food was pretty good, it just takes a while to get used to the ordering concept and the menu.
The restaurant itself resembles a large, cold conference building. It was pretty stark and really open. Perhaps they need all the space for lunch rush, but definitely not on a typical Friday night."}
{"text":"Had the combo #7 & #9 w/ white rice and black beans. Delicious! Spicy!! Mui Bueno!! Will totally go back from the west valley. Yeah buddy!"}
{"text":"Went there around 8pm on a Friday and there was a queue and the place was packed. First time here and heard good things about this place so I figured I'd wait the line. The ordering chit provided was not very intuitive but there was plenty of variety to customize your meal. The wait was long enough to figure out what I wanted. Closer towards the ordering counter, there were pictures of the entrees so I figured I'd just order the 14!

The loud man at the cashier barked for me to come up and place my order. He gave me a scowl when he learned that I hadn't completed the order paper. He tossed it aside and rolled his eyes when I asked for the 14. 

The food was not bad. The place was crowded and cheap looking (why are the walls painted white?). Trash on the ground and around the soda, napkin, straws table. All the patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves and the place was loud just from the buzz of conversation. I can't remember if there was music or not. 

The customer service is ugly!! I mean, those employees are rude. I don't see why people are crazy about this place. Two stars only cause the food was tasty. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very busy during lunch hour but orders are processed quick! Great food, good variety... highly recommend.

Informal setting - plastic chairs and tables in restaurant. I call it gourmet food to-go!"}
{"text":"Only our second time here, but well worth making this a regular spot. Excellent concept and keeping things unique and flavorful. Very nice and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Ive tried most of the entrees there now. Every dish was so delicious and flavorful. I like their fried beans as one of the sides. They just need to work on making the menu more user friendly, but otherwise 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time and absolutely loved it. We were allowed to sample a few items before we purchased, something I wish more restaurants would do. I ended up getting the jerk fried rice, red chicken chicken and pulled pork. The rice was very flavorful with a little kick. The chicken was great too ( I can see why it's their best seller). I also had refried black beans for the first time too. The only thing I dont like about this place is that it's too far of a drive for me to become a regular."}
{"text":"Eh, just okay. It was crowded and not as clean as we'd like to see. Food was mediocre. Glad we did it, but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"My taste buds actually gave a standing ovation after having their jade red chicken and jerk fried rice. If you tell them it's your first time there, they will provide you with samples, which in a way served as an appetizer that made me even more excited to try their food. 

Their blend of Mexican, Chinese, and Cuban flavors is a very unique and delicious combination and for the money, you get a very generous portion of food. The Jade Red Chicken is a favorite; I'd also recommend trying their pollo diablo if you want some more kick.

Also, in addition to the awesome food, is their awesome service. They strive to satisfy their customers and that shows through their overall friendly demeanor and their passion for their food. This is definitely a must-visit for anyone who lives/visits AZ."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices!  Please note that this is a place for FOOD, not atmosphere.   Lots of people do take out here (as I do on my way home from work).

The combinations of Chinese, Mexican, and even a little Jamacian (I love their spicy Jerk Chicken) are endless.   While I would not call the food \"traditional authentic\", the uniqueness of their dishes and the way the menu combines flavors is really unique.  If spicy isn't your thing try their Emerald Chicken.  It has a wonderful Ginger flavor that is very pleasing to the pallet.

They will let you sample pretty much any entree.  If you like black beans, theirs are excellent.

I try to watch my carbs so I have stayed away from the rice, and instead just get their salad (which usually has a little shredded cheese on it).  I always leave satisfied.

The food is as 'good as it gets'..."}
{"text":"this  place is heinous.  the staff are nice but the food is revolting.  avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"More \"Bandito' than 'Chino', but delicious all around. Has great jerk chicken and rice and the most incredible chile relleno I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm here weekly. Omnomnomnomnom!  Ahhhh.
SO good. Go on the weekend to get oatmeal raisin or, hopefully, VOLCANO! cookie. 
Get extra #10 sauce when ordering the Emerald Chicken."}
{"text":"Boy! I miss this place.  The Emerald Chicken (Quesadilla style) with the jerk fried rice is great!  When I go back to Chandler, I do make a trip back to this place.

If you are a novice, it will be different in ordering.  You'll feel like you are taking an exam.  Once you know how to order, it becomes second nature.  Happy Eating!!!!"}
{"text":"OK so I am on vacation in AZ and my mom told me she saw this place on the food network and said we had to try it, we are staying in Chandler so I figured hey why not.  The place is pretty cool it fuses Mexican/asian food ( they do have jerk chicken which is considered Jamaican I suppose) anyhow the food was alright it was all pretty basic to me the Jerk chicken was really spicy it definitely needed something... the Terryaki (sp?) chicken was really good but i have tasted it before nothing special ... my sister and mom had the chili reyano over steamed rice they said it was pretty good... I gave it 3 stars because the staff there is freaking awesome the girl who took my order was really helpful because they have you fill out a card and put numbers and letters...it's really weird... but anyways the staff is great and friendly the food is OK nothing special but the price is AMAZING if you are looking for good food for cheap this would be for you because for 5 adults and two children it only came up to $40 and that is really good!!  I probably won't ever go there again but there you have it... 1 1/2 stars for the food .... i wanted to love it but eehh I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"The food at Chino is wonderful...for a fast food-fusion restaurant.  The ordering procedure (you write out orders and hand them to the cashier) is quaint.  But lately, the ambiance has become sub-par.

Sure, there were always tons of little kids (and sometimes adults) running around everywhere, making a mess.  But lately, those messes are not cleaned up promptly enough.  I would be fine with that, if the food was coming out as quickly as it used to.  

Perhaps I'm nostalgic for what Chino's used to be.  Or maybe I'm just getting too old.

The food is still good, but I'm not always willing to overlook everything else."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation!  Jerk chicken and pork fried rice were great!"}
{"text":"I went here months ago and forgot to Yelp about it--oops!  This place was just OK.  I had high expectations with the hundreds of great reviews on here plus it was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The staff is awesome!  They were very friendly and let us sample some of the best sellers to help us make up our mind.  We settled on the Jade Chicken and carnitas.  Both of the meats were very good.  We decided to have the carnitas in a quesadilla, which was delicious.  The Jade chicken was very good too.  My least favorite part of the meal was the rice.  It was very sweet and tasted like it had a lot of five spice in it.  The free snickerdoodle was really good though, so that kinda made up for it.  I don't know if I'd come back again.  The portion sizes are quite small (compared to most Mexican and Chinese restaurants where they really load you up) and the prices are a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"Interesting food. I am obsessed with the beans, they're amazing!...Sometimes the chicken is perfect and sometimes it is a bit too overcooked."}
{"text":"Asian-Mexican Fusion. Saw this on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to be adventurous. They give you samples of rice, beans, and pork which was nice so you weren't ordering blindly. 
Trying to order was a bit confusing because of the system they use. 
The fusion of the foods just doesn't work. It's like putting Panda Express sweet and sour chicken inside a Taco Bell quesadilla. I wasn't a fan. They do give you a snicker doodle cookie with your order which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. It's a Mexican-Chinese fusion and makes me a feel like I'm eating something healthy. The quesadillas are fantastic too. 
Absolutely love the jerk chicken with the jerk fried rice. 
Make sure you ask for the chocolate cookie over the weekends."}
{"text":"Fantastic synergy of Chinese & Latin American cuisine (merging the owners' worlds).  Build your own combinations, then choose to have it served in bowls/burritos or with quesadillas. The ordering process can take a few minutes to figure out but they're patient and offer free samples of the dishes and sauces to help you decide. 

The Emerald Chicken is a great example of their fusion menu. It's tender, skinless grilled chicken served with a light ginger green onion sauce. I chose to have it over Jerk Chicken Rice (Chinese-style fried rice w/ Jamaican Jerk Chicken & green onions... Yum!). You can also opt for plain white rice, yet trust me, the Jerk Chicken is bomb-lish-ish.

Since I made my own 2-dish combo, got the famous Jade Chicken with it.  This is a lightly deep-fried chicken served with an Asian sweet sauce. I'm a fan of both these dishes. You also have your choice of beans. As per most people I know who eat here, the black beans win. 

Fantastic fusion food!  5 star food experience, yet I'm giving 4 starts since ambience is a part of the overall food experience when ordering out."}
{"text":"I recently saw a food network episode where they featured Chino Bandido. Since I love both Chinese and Mexican food it sounded like a real hit. The choices are all mix and match. Yes, they serve both Mexican and Chinese but you can turn your favorite Chinese dish into Mexican. Any of the Chinese fair can be served burrito style or even in a quesadilla. Some of the food is a bit more spicy, which I tend to like. I went the traditional route and had some of the JADE RED CHICKEN (Lightly coated, deep-fried chicken glazed with slightly spicy sweet sauce. Different and habit-forming) and the CARNITAS  (Mild, slow-cooked shredded pork sautéed with onion, tomato and cilantro) 
burrito style. The black beans are smoothe and spicy (yum!) To top it off I had the jerk style fried rice. To top it off your meal includes one of the best darn cookies you've ever had. The location in Chandler is huge so if you want to walk in with a big party they can accomodate you. It really is a must try."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I saw Chino Bandido on Diners Drive-ins & Dives and decided to check it out while visiting Phoenix last weekend. What a disappointment!  Erik T. and Roland W. are on-the-money with their reviews. While the employees were nice and very helpful with their overly complicated ordering process, the place was dirty and it took way too long to get our food. We thought the refried beans and fried rice were good but my machaca was bone-dry and my girl's gringo chicken and emerald chicken were absolutely flavorless. The egg foo yung was just OK.  

We'd have been better off going to Taco Bell.  Way over-hyped."}
{"text":"$14 for a meal give me a break way too much ripping people off I would not recommend the place"}
{"text":"I love the emerald chicken! I found the recipe on a blog, so hopefully I can recreate at home. The dinning area is like a bad cafeteria, but the staff is really friendly and they give you samples to try before ordering. If in the area you have to try it out."}
{"text":"What a surprise of food and flavor. I got the jade red chicken along with diablo chicken along with pork rice while my wife got a pork quesadilla with rice and beans. The beans and rice were fabulous. I just had visions of floating the salt river all morning, then returning home tired, burned, and buzzed looking to kill any food in my sights.  Turns out all these years of running home and eating Ramiro's or Chinese was a waste. I could have had both and died happy. All capped off by a wonderful snicker doodle and the bill for 18 bucks!!!!!  I'm a happy customer who will return."}
{"text":"Prolly the best place in town. The Asian/Mexican/Jamaican fusion is no joke. Awesome food with big portions. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Didn't think I'd like the fusion, but it was really good! I stayed safe with the Chinese BBQ and white rice. It's a no frills kind of place, but a must try!"}
{"text":"HEY YALL...I Love Love Love this place....you gotta get the Pork Carnitas....absolutely pathetically deviously delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious. We shared the combination plates for the red jade chicken, pollo diablo and the jerk chicken and the carnitas. Staff is very friendly and helpful and the food lived up to the hype. This is truly a 5 star, 300+ review place and you can't beat the price. Throw on a t-shirt and jeans and enjoy delicious food."}
{"text":"This place used to be that rare hole in the wall with a really fun concept and an awesome menu. A clever idea and an excellent bang for your buck. I'm sad to say that lately it's been too greasy and the quality of food has really gone downhill. \"Burritos\" come sotting in 2 ounces of oil at the bottom of the pan, the meats are often low quality and full of gristle and anything breaded tastes like it was sitting in a freezer too long before either was fried. I really used to enjoy this place, but putting up with low quality food isn't worth the snickerdoodle anymore."}
{"text":"Fast service, nice sized portions a love that you can try several samples to decide what works for you. Fun combo of beans, rice and the main course. If you're a purist looking for Mexican or Chinese, Chino Bandido isn't for you. But a fun and creative restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite food in AZ! We travel from Mesa for this delightful treat!! I think they changed up the carnita's a little, but still good! My jade red chicken casadeas were fab. as always!! Love you, CB!"}
{"text":"Always good.  I like the Red Jerk Chicken, but this last time I picked #5 the Gringo Chicken. It was mild (which was why I ordered it) and flavorful. The only downside was that it was swimming in butter.  I like the flavor, but it was really heavy."}
{"text":"I could maybe live on jerk fried rice and snickerdoodles."}
{"text":"My wife and I had visited this restaurant a few days ago with my father in law.  He is in from Chicago and watched a show on this place.  At his insistance we traveled there and ate lunch.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was amazing as was the staff.  The location left a little to be desired but hey, some of the best places are in the most odd locations.

One thing that separated them from the rest was the ability to try the food before you buy it.  Let them know you are new and they will gladly let you try samples of there main dishes.

Overall a great time and great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  fast service and a Snickerdoodle cookie to end the meal - whats not to love ? The Jade Red Chicken is awesome!  Just feel good food at good prices. Simple and unpretentious,  come prepared."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out of our way to try this joint and it was totally worth it! Great combo of Mexican spices and Chinese seasonings. The carnitas rice bowl with fried rice was so tasty! We will def come back when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This was the second time that I've eaten their food but the first time I've been to their establishment. The first time, someone ordered from there and I just so happen to be there to pick off their leftovers.
The boyfriend and I decided to try something new for lunch and we were in the area so we stopped by. It was around 2:45pm on a Saturday so it was crowded! Since it was my bf's first time we decided to wait to try the samples. 
Very nice guy let us try pretty much whatever we wanted. So we tried the Carnitas (a little dry but had great flavor) Jade chicken (which I'm told is very popular; equivilant to a spicy version of sweet and sour chicken) Emerald chicken (fresh tasting, not spicy at all) and finally the Jerk fried rice (right about of spice and tasty)
We both decided to try different things so we can try them all! I ordered the combo plate with black beans, jerk fried rice, carnitas quesadilla and jade chicken. I believe he ordered the pollo diablo in a burrito, emerald chicken and refried beans with steamed rice. Everything was delicious and it was such a variety of food!
I know this place has been around for quite sometime and the concept of the cuisine fusions works so well! My only complaint is that this place looks very dirty and dingy. I understand the term \"hole in the wall\" but at least move locations or clean up the place a bit. Other than that, great food!

PS you get a cookie with each meal so try the Volcano cookie (brownie) and the Snickerdoodles (cinnamon sugar)"}
{"text":"I had heard about Chino Bandido and knew that Guy Fieri had it on \"Triple D\" as a must go to place so when an out of town coworker asked where's a good place to go for lunch, how could I resist trying this place?  So many people I know either want Chinese or Mexican for lunch, this is the best fusion of both worlds.

I *LOVE* spicy food!  For me, the hotter the better.  If I can still speak and breathe and my eyes aren't watering, I don't see how they can really call it \"spicy.\"

This being said, I went straight for the SUICIDE PLATTER!!!  I was NOT disappointed!  I had the Jerk Chicken, Pollo Diablo with Cuban style hot black beans, and Jerk fried rice.  They provided a warm snickerdoodle cookie for dessert.  *swoon*

The chicken dishes were all so nice and juicy and yes they definitely activated the heat-seeker in me.  As for the Cuban style hot black beans, they brought on flashbacks of how my Aunt (from Cuba) used to make them when I was a kid and lived near her.  Wish I had the recipe but they unfortunately declined so I'll be hitting up my Aunt for her recipe.

When friends, coworkers and relatives are in town I always tell them to go to Chino Bandido and downright beg to go with them!

The only reason this isn't five stars may sound silly to most people, but it is the portion size.  It is just way too much food for me.  Seriously.

By all means, DO SAMPLE THE DIFFERENT FOODS...  Find what you like and piece together your own combination \"Takee-Outee\" (taken straight off the menu, they said it) even though most eat right there.  

Yes, it is extremely busy.  That's a good sign!

If I hadn't been going straight for the Suicide Platter because I wanted to see just how hot/spicy their food truly was without sacrificing taste (or tastebuds), I would have gotten one of many other tasty dishes I sampled.

The Jade Red Pork was delicious, as was the Emerald Chicken which was so tender it practically melted in my mouth.  I sampled the Carnitas, Chile Relleno, Hengrenade Chicken too and all were wonderful.  Machaca...yummy!

For me, it is a bit of a drive but well worth the trip!  It was a no-brainer when I worked 5 minutes from there.
Wish I could give it 4.75 stars."}
{"text":"So my bf and I went to the new location in Chandler. It was set back from the road and slightly hidden, so it was a bit hard to find. The inside is huge. Like a warehouse. The walls were lined with plastic outdoor tables and chairs. Kind of weird but whatever. The food was INTERESTING. Some of the things I tried were good and some were not so good. 
I had the Red Chicken, Diablo quesadilla and Jerk Fried Rice. The Diablo chicken was incredibly salty and greasy. I would not order it again. The Red Chicken was bomb! And the Jerk Chicken alone was amazing. I also tasted the Emerald Chicken and that was good, but weird.
My bf loved the Jerk Chicken and the Red Chicken. I would definitely go back and try more things. I love the variety. And for the price it's a really great deal. You get a lot of food and a drink for about $10! If you are looking for something cheap with lots of options then I would recommend it! If your mom is in town visiting, take her somewhere a bit nicer."}
{"text":"Seen on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. A fan after the first visit! You can sample some of their items, the staff is knowledgeable, and the food is super flavorful! Ended up ordering the 3 items hubby and I sampled: the carnitas, the jade red chicken, and the emerald chicken. The jerk chicken fried rice and beans were the perfect sides. Great prices, great food - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"my buddy introduced  my fiancee and me to two combination dishes. I had  the Caribbean beans w  cheese,  Diablo chicken rice(med spice), & jade chicken burrito. my  girl got the same but w  jerk  chicken instead of Diablo chicken.  we also tried the fresh snicker doodle cookies. 
keep  in mind,  my girl is picky in everything she eats.  never wants to try new things but she enjoyed eating this place  for our first time.  everything we ate  we enjoyed.  we will eat this again."}
{"text":"Delish!  I have the Jen Red Pork and Jerk Fried rice when I visit.  I have also had the chili relleno too, which was tasty!  The cherry on top of a great lunch is the warm snickerdoodle that comes with the meal!  MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"It just feels dirty walking inside. Quality of the food has sadly dipped over the years as well. This place used to be really great! Sadly after our last experience, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My first time today! Unbelievable flavor I ordered three combos. Funny thing there was only two of us. Wow!!! Very good a great place. I certainly recommend eating there."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years and after reading reviews on here I just HAD to go. Everything about the place exceeded my expectations which is why I'm happy to give Chino Bandito 5 stars.

Moments after we walked in, a woman behind the counter asked if it was our first time there. She then began giving us samples of their most popular dishes and explaining each one. I already had in mind what I wanted to try from reading reviews but I really appreciated getting to try a few things I hadn't planned on ordering. She then explained the ordering process which is a little tricky so pay attention! Two combo meals and two beers came out to $24. Now that's one hell of a deal!

After taking a seat in the dining area our food arrived within 5 minutes. Good golly, they do NOT skimp on portions, you get what you pay for and then some. I ordered the jade chicken in a quesodilla, chili relleno, jerk fried rice and the black beans. My boyfriend ordered the jade chicken, jerk chicken in a quesodilla, jerk fried rice and the black beans. The jade chicken was sooo good and even better in a quesodilla. The chili relleno was covered in bits of fried wontons. Cutting it open let loose an oozing river of melted cheese. The chili, cheese and wontons were beyond delicious - soft, gooey, crunchy. The jerk fried rice was super tasty and was a great compliment to everything on the plate... or rather, metal take out container. Then came the black beans. Let me tell you, I don't even like beans and I could not stop eating these beans! They have a slightly sweet taste that I couldn't get enough of. My boyfriend's jerk chicken quesodilla was also fantastic.

This is definitely a neighborhood place. Throughout our meal kids were running around with a blow-up Spider Man doll while their parents enjoyed football on the TVs in the dining room. I was in such food heaven that the kids' ruckus, which normally would have annoyed me to no end, didn't even phase me. It was all part of the atmosphere. I also want to address a review that said the restaurant was \"filthy\". Certainly this was no fine dining establishment but it was by no means filthy, I wouldn't even call it dirty. My table was clean, my shoes didn't stick to the floor and there wasn't garbage strewn about. Oh and my tummy was just fine after eating their wonderful food.

And the cookies! How could I forget? They had snickerdoodle and oatmeal raisin so we got both. The snickerdoodle was everything a snickerdoodle should be - soft, sweet and cinnamony - totally delicious. The oatmeal raisin was pretty good, not my favorite though.

This is a definite must try place. The flavor combinations are fantastic and you'll be surprised how good Mexican/Asian/Caribbean food blends together."}
{"text":"Way over hyped!  Food was eh and service was mediocre.  Was hoping for something so much better after seeing them on TV.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Love the combo cuisine! The Jade Red Chicken, refried black beans and assorted rices are always good. The quesadillas are also worth splurging on! This place isn't for everyone, but don't skip on it without trying it out first."}
{"text":"Look. I know the whole Chinese Mexican theme throws people off. But seriously, the food is amazing. Jade red chicken and jerk chicken with the jerk fried rice and Jamaican black beans are awesome. Don't let the menu fool you, this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is in an old strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside, and isn't really much on the inside either, and I love it that way!  Such a dive!  There is a reason it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives!  Here is a link if you haven't seen the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86kjMk63PLY.  The food is a fusion of Chinese, Mexican, and Caribbean.  When you walk in there is a tasting counter where you can sample the food and they can help you fill out your order.  You have your choice of many different items including quesadillas, teriyaki chicken, Jamaican jerk chicken, beans, and rice.  My favorite is the Jade Red chicken, a Chinese side similar to orange chicken, but so much better!  You also get a cookie with your order, usually a snicker doodle, but certain days they serve other types of cookies.  There is a location in Chandler as well.  We come often, delicious and unique concept!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I totally agree with Jetta R.  A similiar scenario happens to me everytime I ask someone that has never heard about Chino Bandido.   When you do ask someone who has been to the place they get so excited and start asking have you tried the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice, etc etc... and how did they ever think that you could mix all those things together?  It's a crazy concoction that works and can not be described but must be experienced."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. This is coming from someone who found his perfect personalized combo (jade red chicken burrito, bbq pork quesadilla) and usually orders the same thing every time. Although, I've noticed a strange pattern, whenever I end up taking a first timer here: if they end up ordering anything other than what I recommend, they usually have anywhere from a mediocre reaction to flat-out hating their meal. Emerald Chicken, ordered alone, has consistently been rated to me as tasting like \"cat food.\" Then they taste my burrito or quesadilla and say \"That's amazing! I should've ordered that!\" I do think this place needs some kind of a makeover. The Phoenix location, while feeling a little run-down, at least has some personality to it and feels welcoming. Also, something has to be done about the ordering system. Sure, it's not rocket science, but it's gotta tell you something when every new customer that walks through the door looks completely dumbfounded. Despite these criticisms, I do recommend trying it out. I mean, come on! Mexican/Chinese fusion! How often do you see that around?"}
{"text":"Amazing beyond belief!!!! Can't even say more than AMAZINGGGGG BEST place ever!! Great food! Great service!! And they let you sample!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We all love Chinese food.  And of course, we all love Mexican food.  And then, there's Chino Bandido.  

I don't living in Phoenix, but, this is one dive I hit up every time I'm in town.  The fact is, each time you eat at Chino, it could be a new experience.  I confess that I waited till AFTER I'd eaten there a bunch of times before I dared think about putting pen to paper and write a review.  There are simply too many combinations (and too little stomach space) to be able to really get a good sense of their food in one sitting.  Once you find the combinations that you love, you'll be hooked.  

I'm not going to start by painting myself as the prototypical self-professed foodie.  Hey, I love foie and truffle oil as much as the next guy.  But, more than anything, I love my comfort food grub.  And whatever your fancy, there's probably something at Chino that you will love.  Note the recent popularity and variety of food trucks abound.  The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Chino food, is that it's kind of food truck-ish (but, this was before the food trucks, and done in a way the food trucks couldn't possibly replicate).  Some call it Chinese-Mexican fusion.  It's certainly not \"fusion\" in the expected sense.  It's more like what you'd get if you asked a really great Chinese chef to prepare a Mexican meal, do it inside a really big food truck, and serve it in disposable/recyclable containers.  It's got the bright and complex Chinese flavors that we have become really familiar with, but, delivered in a very simple and comforting Mexican format that most of us in this country have grown accustomed to.  

Set aside the fancy napkins and place-settings for a bit.  It's not by any means pretentious food, and, as regulars would attest to, you can eat here on a shoe-string budget.  It doesn't hurt that with your meal, they also serve (if they have any left) a homemade snickerdoodle or chocolate volcano cookie to finish things off.  These things are to die for, and man, I'll tell you ... get me the recipes for the cookies alone and it would be enough to make a business venture out of.  It's easy to see how some might be fooled by the simplicity of Chino's food, considering the type of joint this is.  But, there's something very rich, comforting, and accessible about it that keeps regulars coming back for more.  Just ask them (you can always spot the regulars by how they order).  My personal favorite is the Emerald Chicken in a quesadilla.  Or, wait, ... is it the red chicken over jerked fried rice.  See the problem?  Thats why I usually order both."}
{"text":"Wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm giving it 3 stars because the staff was great. Very friendly when you walk in and don't know what to order they help you out."}
{"text":"It's got a panda that looks like Pancho Villa.  That's an A+ in my book for style.  The food ranges from \"That was okay\" to \"That was awesome.\"  Serving time, really quick.  I'm not down with their cookies, but my friends think I'm insane for thinking this, so perhaps it is just me.  Thumbs up for serving cookies though - if you're going to mix Mexican and Asian food, why the heck not add cookies?  Overall, good price, good food, Panda with guns."}
{"text":"Save your money!!  The food is terrible.  The restaurant was dirty.  For all the hype, this place was a huge disappointment.  The dining \"room\" or cheap \"catering hall\" is filled with plastic tables and chairs.  My food was hardly edible and my three kids refused to eat the teriyaki chicken.  They said it tasted more like turkey than chicken.  The meat was dry and chewy.  Overall, terrible in every way.  Don't waste your money or a night out to dinner.  Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Chino your food is awesome but you are an older establishment and you need to focus on cleanliness. Being older is understandable but being dirty is another. Your air vents in the lobby and throughout  are disgusting and filthy! Air conditioner  is caked in grease and dirt. That alone could make you sick. Your walls need to be wiped and cleaned. You floors need the same. Do this and you get a 5 star. . Without it...two at best."}
{"text":"This place has a very unique ordering system. But don't worry, the friendly staff will help you. (Thank you very much Ive). Ive was very friendly, professional, and had a very nice smile. In fact, all staff that I observed here, seem to really enjoy their job.  They have wonderful food combinations, and the staff will also help you decide which goes best with each other. Place was somewhat busy, but food was still served very quickly. Food was Very delicious, hot, and full of flavor. I will be back soon, and try some other delicious combination"}
{"text":"I would give Chino Bandido 4.75 stars. The only reason why it's not completely 5 stars is that it wasn't very clean, and the atmosphere wasn't great either, but the food was excellent. I heard it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I decided, why not go there? When I went there I really wasn't excepting much, but the service was very nice and the staff let us sample their food which was really nice and welcoming. Everyone of the options I tried they had given us was incredible. I ordered Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken with a side of Chicken Fried Rice. People say it's difficult to order but it seemed like a piece of cake to me. The Chicken Fried Rice was very moist and delicious. The Emerald Chicken was very juicy, succulent, moist, buttery, it melts in your mouth, and the quality is undeniable. The Jade Red Chicken is to die for. It was very flavorful and crunchy and the meat was moist. It's like Orange Chicken but better. The Jade Red Chicken is also on the spicy side also. I also got a volcano chocolate cookie which was good, but it was a little sweet. I even got a small  t-shirt since I'm an eleven year old boy using my step-mom's name. I will definitely come back to this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Been going here for years - Always a place to take someone for the first time.  Crazy variety of tastes.  Can Get busy - Food is good.  Cookies are great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's such a crazy mix of food that works! Great for a quick lunch or dinner! The combination of food you can put together is amazing! I don't think I have had the same thing combo twice! Chicken fried rice is one of my favs! Try it out! 

Pro tip: If it's your first time, talk to the employees on ordering! They are a big help! Also they have samples to try!"}
{"text":"Such a fun food fusion. I've never had this food combo before and didn't know what to expect. But needless to say, my mouth was left with surprises. You won't be disappointed!
The decor is simple, but there is no need to fluff up the dining area when the food is focus.
I gladly drive the 20 minutes to eat here."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Arizona (and i grew up here). Recommend 7/11 burrito or quesadilla"}
{"text":"takee outee... how do i love thee?  let me count the ways!  so many options... so much fun.  friendly, and fast service.  no nonsense here.  and that's all we want.  the set up is plain jane, the food and tastes are not.  really a great mixture and very filling.  love the emerald chicken.  love the snickerdoodle and the beans are so yummy.  show up...  eat in....  or take out.  it's all good .  i want some"}
{"text":"Don't expect much in terms of atmosphere but that's part of the charm and who needs atmosphere when the food is this good?! Always get the jade red chicken and black beans, anything else and you're seriously missing out."}
{"text":"Delicious, the perfect combination of flavor and spice! Very unique find in the valley! The staff is so friendly and offers samples before you order! 
When I have visitors in town, this is a must  go to!"}
{"text":"REALLY miss this restaurant.  Such an odd but oh-so-satisfying combination of flavors.  Need one in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Rating:  Two Tum's Down, as in you'll need two tums after eating here. 

Service: was great,  gave us the 8 samples and i would've felt bad for walking away after trying them.  so despite my gut feeling, i stayed

Ate: the jerk chicken seasoning is pepper...and lots of it.  had orange chicken quesadilla, jade chicken burrito, black beans, and chicken fried rice.  taste is like panda express threw up at taco bell.  

Pros: painting of panda wearing a sombero eating w/ chopsticks while  sitting on a rickshaw pulled by a donkey. try to wrap your head around that for a second... 

Cons: my stomach hurt so bad it was hard to work after lunch. order up a handful of antacids to remedy the situation.  in a moment of weakness i ate the leftovers a few hours later and was pleasantly surprised by the same pain again for dinner.  

i will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Favorite dive place in Phoenix. Too bad they closed the Chandler location. 7q x 7q with black beans and chicken rice is the way to go!"}
{"text":"If they tried to design a more complicated ordering process they would fail. I say just put up a big \"wheel of fortune\" and customers can just give it a spin. Personally I think the reason they keep it is so they can interact with customers as they patiently explain how to order. Something they all seem to do well.

On my first visit I was with a big party. My order was lost or someone else claimed it. Whatever, I drank another beer and left hungry. The second visit was successful. The key is not to think too much when ordering.

I had the gringo and jerk chicken. The meat, beans and rice were really fresh.  There is a lot of flavor here. You can get a meal and a drink for around $10 and that makes this place a winner.  Plus they give you a cookie too. Not a fortune cookie a real cookie."}
{"text":"Best food in the state of Arizona, good place with a huge selection of mexican, chinese, thai, japanese mix & match to you tastes. Great cookies too."}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2008, Service is always great, Chinese/Mexican Fusion is delicious. Chicken and pork are always perfect. Hot and delicious. pollo Diablo!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for our usual DDD find while in town for a soccer tournament. Ummmm not sure how this place has such great ratings, maybe it was what we got but it was not good. Sorry. I got the red chicken and fried rice The chicken wasn't bad but the rice was awful -- so sticky and gloppy. My daughter got a quesadilla which had way too much Rosemary (or that is what it tasted like) -- it made the food taste like medicine. My husband got a combo plate with a bunch of stuff (I'm not sure what all he got) with a jerk chicken quesadilla (I know he got this because I tasted it), and again too much of a seasoning making it taste like medicine. None of us finished our food. The best part of the meal was the cookie...."}
{"text":"The first thing I thought of when I heard of Chino Bandido nearly 10 years ago was that Chinese-Mexican food does not seem like a good mix.  Boy was I incorrect about that, it is definitely an experience.  I cannot get enough Jade Red Chicken and Black Beans, they are the two things I constantly crave from Chino's.  

I have tried everything on the menu (they give you samples if you've never been there before), and I eat other things there often, but I ALWAYS get the Jade Red Chicken.  I love how you can make any entree into a quesadilla or burrito.  The place is kind of a dive, but that adds to its charm.  Plus, you and a group of friends can have a play a rousing game of Jenga while waiting for your food, it's the makings of a fun time.  

I understand that this place is not for everybody, but I would say that you should give a try and see what you think, it just might surprise you.

Don't forget the snicker-doodles."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Found them on Diner and Dives.  So good. I love their emerald chicken. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Frank and Eve (the owners), I hope you or someone who cares reads this!
This is a review of the Chandler location.

I've been a long time patron of Chino Bandido, starting with their first location at 19th Ave and Greenway in North Phoenix.
Quality, care and portions have always been the first priority.
My last three experiences with the Chandler location over the past 4 months have gotten progressively worse each time.
The most recent was this past Sunday evening around 6:30 for a carry out order.  The person who handled the order was very nice.  No issue here.  Although concern arose when she mentioned that the current kitchen staff was making the Egg Foo Yung we ordered for the first time.
The Egg Foo Yung ended up being the best part of the meal, as well as the complimentary Snicker Doodle cookie.
The Hengrenade Chicken was dry and leathery with little flavor left on or in it.  The Diablo chicken was also not their best effort, overcooked and dry as well.
The fried rice tasted as though it had been in a steam pan for hours...crunchy, dry and flavorless.  The kind of thing I might expect at the end of the night from a lesser establishment.
I'm not going to dwell on this, but unless some things change at the Chandler location, I really am not motivated to return at this point.
If I'm up North, I'll try the 19th Ave location in hopes that the same issues are not occurring there.
Frank and Eve (the owners) are wonderful people, so I am hopeful they take action and can get Chandler back to the really good Chinese /  Mexican fusion restaurant they once were."}
{"text":"I heard this place was awesome. I went once and never again lol my meal was iceburg lettuce with salsa and my boyfriend got the jerk chicken which was pretty much cardboard with pepper. The guy who took our order was a douche."}
{"text":"Okay I went WAAAAY out of my way to check out this place after reading the great YELPs about it, and when I saw that Food Network Star Guy Fieri covered it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  Must be FAB, right?   Not so much.  First, the service - if it can be called that - is remarkably apathetic.   When you are standing directly in front of a cashier for 5 minutes or more, and you have to actually say, \"um, could I order?\" before they are aware you are standing there, I think this is a symptom of a service issue.   Second, it just doesn't seem CLEAN in there; our tables were dirty and there is an off smell in the place.   And third, the food was OKAY but not amazing or awesome in any way.  Now for the disclaimer - I'm not totally qualified to judge any restaurant that serves a majority of meat-based dishes because I am vegetarian.   And my date that evening, who does eat meat, liked his.   But yawn on all the things I could eat - boring, greasy, served waaaay too slowly.  And it wasn't even very busy.   So basically I would say I was disappointed and for those of you who live 25 miles from this place like I do, don't waste the gas! ! !"}
{"text":"Hair in take out - called them and didn't seem to care much. I've been a long time greenway 19th ave customer and very regular to get take out from chandler location . Food is ok they need to maintain better service and hygiene."}
{"text":"Food is good....not great.the ordering system is a headache. I love the snicker doodles cookies. The end"}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised by this place. Me and two other buddies hit this place up to see what it's all about. Grab a ticket, fill out what you want, pay, then eat. Trust me you come here for the food not the scenery. I had the jade chicken in a burrito. It had a great flavor and was cooked quite well. In addition, I also got beans, jerk fried rice, and a cheese quesadia. All good, it was amazing and they use a good quality Mexican cheese."}
{"text":"Jade red Chicken is to DIE for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful and the concept is great, I would absolutely go back again and the service was great only problem and not really a problem is it's a little difficult to order your first time but the staff is great to help"}
{"text":"Tastes just the way it smells... Delicious. Pretty much everything I tried was great, underestimated the heat in the jerk chicken though, food was amazing overall."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido's is a classic.. I always get the number jade red chicken and diablo chicken with jerk fried rice and back beans.. love the heat!.. and wash it all down with the free snickerdoodle cookie!"}
{"text":"Not fresh AT ALL.  this place was crazy busy so I'm not sure why it wasn't at least hot.  Tasted like left overs from early on the week."}
{"text":"Love it.  Jade red, machaca quesadilla, black beans, jerk fried rice, and the doodle.  I've been eating there for years.  Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected. Their most
Popular chicken dish was super dry and just not that good. Sorry Chino Bandido fans, we won't be back and I wish I could get my $20 back."}
{"text":"I drive 385 miles to eat here 4 times a year. Wish I lived next door. Enough food for 3 meals. Prices and quality can't be beat."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for more than a decade. The experience is extremely casual (being across the street from a trailer park) and their food very tasty, if a little greasy. Don't plan to eat healthy here really, although their 9 and 13,  jerk and emerald chicken are not coated and are quite good. If you don't mind the slightly brusque service and take out atmosphere, and eating relatively unhealthy, if very very tasty food, then recommended."}
{"text":"Great -- if not a somewhat odd combination of food!! But where can you get Jade Red Chicken AND a chile relleno on the same plate! Not to mention the yummy soft and chewy snickerdoodle that comes with your meal! Definitely tasty morsels!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! After reading all the wonderful reviews and having eaten at the Phoenix location, I have to say this Chandler location is lacking. Had the Jade and Jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. Jade chicken wasn't horribly bad. It has an OK flavor but expected it to be 'more' I guess. The jerk chicken you can taste the spices and overall was ok. Neither will make me come back. The jerk fried rice was kinda hard. Maybe I got the last of a batch. My husband had the machaca and carnitas plate with refried beans and fried rice. DO NOT get the beans! I think the canned ones I had had more flavor than those. The machaca and carnitas were ok. May be good for a burrito or tacos, sadly we won't know as we won't go back. The snickernoodle cookie was good. I give it 2 stars for effort and because 2 out of the 2 meats we tried were Ok. Not sure if I just expected more from this place after reading all the good reviews, but then again they have a sign at the register that they give you free chips and what not if you show a good review on Yelp. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"How neat! Good food! I didn't really like the hengrenade chicken, but my gringo chicken quesadilla was delicious! The jade red chicken was amazing! There's really something special about pork fried rice mixed with refried beans! (Those beans are amazing BTW) can't wait to try more! Almost forgot, that snickerdoodle cookie was a great finishing touch!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so popular, and has such a high rating. Reading these amazing Yelp reviews really encouraged me to go here, and needless to say, I was not very impressed.

Location:
It's in a weird part of town off Greenway, I wouldn't call it the best area ever, certainly not the worst.

Ordering and Food:
The place is a fusion restaurant. Figuring out how to properly order food on the piece of paper takes a bit. The person at the register is very helpful, but . . .  The food itself is all right. It's not my favorite, and perhaps I should try something else off the menu. The snickerdoodles are pretty darn tasty though."}
{"text":"The Chinese food is OK, the Mexican food is OK. If they focused on just one, it would probably be good, but it is cool how a place like this exists to sell both these types of food together. Pretty decent value."}
{"text":"This place caught me completely off guard. A friend of mine who lived in Phoenix years ago recommend this place to us since we were out in Phoenix visiting relatives.

Wow.. good stuff! Interesting too. 

GET the jerk chicken fried rice. wow... Jade chicken.. yummy.. Black beans.. even better. Most of our party opted with Chinese and I'm sorry we didn't get more Mexican to try it. 

Note - It's not fancy, no one waits on your table. You order at the counter and they bring your food out. Great prices... great food.."}
{"text":"This place has been here for ever.  It's in a rough-seeming area (with the usual vape and other seedy businesses).  The food is very tasty.  But the place is FILTHY.  Don't bring your kids here.  When you sit down to eat, you better bring a sani-wipe.  The plastic picnic tables and lawn chairs have a black, oily residue from prior customers, and often random smears of sauces.  But as a quick, low-end food joint, it is fast, and very yummy.  They have snicker-doodle cookies which are good.  But the chocolate volcano ones are 10x better, but only on certain days.  Why they don't offer them all the time is beyond me.  It's not cheap: it's probably the same price as many fancier restaurants, but I come here because coworkers insist.  I'd only give 2.5 stars if the system would let me."}
{"text":"Yummy food and large portions but very greasy/heavy.  Family friendly and with special cookie selections on weekends.  Worth checking out if not the kind of place you go weekly."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a mixmatch meal of Chinese and Mexican.  Their black beans are amazing!  This is a place you have to try at least once."}
{"text":"We went based on a recommendation from a friend and were obviously first timers when we walked in because a staff member quickly flagged us down out of line and showed us the ropes. We were given an unlimited number of samples before deciding what to order. Decided on the #7, #8 and a #7 quesadilla. Oh my stars! Everything was so delicious! It wasn't your standard Mexican food nor was it your standard Chinese food, it was so good! Portion sizes were quite generous and every meal comes with a complimentary snickerdoodle cookie. So good! We will be back next time we are in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on the food network channel, so while on vacation in Phoenix we stopped here. The food was really good. I absolutely loved their ginger chicken and jade red chicken. I wish this place was in oklahoma."}
{"text":"Been coming to Chino for many many years. The food is absolutely amazing, unique, and has never degraded in quality. It may look shabby on the outside, however, the prompt service, quick food orders and pickup is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I went there last night to try the Emerald Chicken other reviewers were raving about. Bah! What I got was barely warm, bland chicken pieces and white rice. Were it not for the flavorful verde sauce, the meal would have been tasteless. I am not tempted to return."}
{"text":"Ay Yai, Yai Yai, I Yam the Chino Bandido!        Can you hear the tune?  

We took the trek from downtown Phoenix to the 'burbs to get this Mexican Chinese fusion fast food.  it was was an easy drive there, but a round-a-bout way back thanks to my refusal to read a map and my co-pilots poor navigating skills.  We were trying to \"see\" the Arizona typical architecture--in the dark... But we WERE full and happy.

It was so totally worth the drive!  A helpful girl de-mystified  the ordering process  and fed us samples. It's a confusing ordering process to the uninitiated,  I won't even try to describe how to order, the helpful girl will do a much better job when you get there.  

We ordered the Jade Red Chicken--like General Tso's Chicken, ok, nothing spectacular.  Pork fried rice--I loved this, different flavor and tasty to please me. Chinese BBQ pork--different from te bright red Chinese style that I was expecting. Very delicately flavored...so good.  Emerald Chicken-- a nice bright clean flavor with cilantro, my favorite. Chile Relleno--filled with a lot of cheese and fried in what looked like a Cheeze-It crust?  Wierd and too crunchy.  A mouth full of crackers and melted cheese with a hint of roasted chile. Um, no. 
Cuban Black beans, they were good because I'm not a fan of refried beans.

Casual fast food environment in a strip mall. With a free snickerdoodle!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D, (Diners, Drive-In's and Dives) Guy seemed to really love it. My husband and I were actually surprised at how good it was. He isn't a big Chinese food fan and I was a little nervous after seeing the inside, its run down and needs some serious remodeling but overall the food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandito is a very cool idea.  They have a restaurant environment like no other and everyone I know raves about how awesome their food is.  To be honest, I thought their food was very mediocre.  Creativity does not count more than food quality.  Immediately after leaving the restaurant I had a horrible stomach ache.  Then I farted for a good 12 hours in response to the food.  No bueno.  I got the jerk and jade red chicken it wasn't all that people are saying.  Mediocre.  

If you want mexican food, go to a mexican restaurant.  if you want chinese food go to a chinese restaurant.  not worth checking out the fusion."}
{"text":"The concept of Mexican & Asian fusion is intriguing, but I feel that there is something lacking here.  I rarely come here, but since my car was getting serviced next door, this was a handy lunch location.  As usual, the service was excellent.  My officemate and I had just walked in when a lady behind the counter called out to us for samples.  She had an excellent attitude and had us sample all the items.  Usually the sample person just asks what you're interested in.  They even deliver your food to your table.  On the plus side, they have a lot of choices and combinations in generous portions.  The downside, though, is that the food's just a bit better than OK.  It's a bit greasy and the ordering system still confuses me.  I still can't quite put my finger on what's lacking here, but perhaps it's all the empty space? The layout of the tables allow a lot of wasted space.  They probably could put in more tables and there still would be plenty of room for everyone dining."}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept at this place but the customer service wasn't very great. After being in line for a while and next in line to have our order taken, another group of people walked in and went to the other side of us. It was a group of teens. The man at the register asked if they wanted to sample and then took 15 minutes to give them samples and completely blew us off. It was as if we weren't there at all. So we had to move over to another line. Then the person who took our order was very rude. Most of the tables were dirty with crumbs all over the chairs. When they brought our food to our table, they told us that one of our order still needed a quesadilla, rice and beans that they were waiting on......of course they forgot so we had to go ask for it 15 minutes later. They brought the quesadilla and beans. It was the wrong beans we asked for and they forgot about our rice. They even burned our meat. The quesadillas were really good but nothing amazing. TERRIBLE service. The worst I've experienced eating out ever."}
{"text":"This place is a Phoenix gem.  The food is a great fusion of chinese and mexican.  They serve it up is an amazing array of  combinations.  

Make you you get some of the samples that are always being offered.

Things to try: Jade Red Chicken, Pollo Diablo (this one is great in a quesadilla, Machaca (in a burrito), and the Jerk Chicken.  For sides thing outside of the box and get the black beans and jerk fried rice.

And of course, their snickerdoodles make a great finish....."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Been coming here for years, the food is always delicious. Love the volcano cookies when they have them! Jerk fried rice is the best. Thanks chinos :)"}
{"text":"Chinese and Mexican food combined? Don't judge just enjoy. The staff is always friendly and helpful giving samples to anyone. Jerk chicken, rice black beans. Always a treat going."}
{"text":"food tasted good but I got food poisoning that night. Extreme vomiting. dont eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little strange but it was good. I was sort of not sure what to expect at all and when the people behind the counter found out it was my first visit there, they let me taste a whole bunch of stuff. I really liked that idea since it gave me a good idea of their flavors and their heat (since they said some dishes were spicy...eh, not so much). 

I wound up ordering the jerk chicken with black beans and the jerk chicken fried rice. The jerk chicken had great flavor (I added their hot sauce to it which made it even better -- it's by the soda machine) and the jerk chicken fried rice wasn't skimping on the chicken. The black beans were probably my favourite part. They are just a little sweet and just a little spicy. They were excellent. I think next time I will try one of the cheese crisps or just get a tortilla to sop up the beans. The portions are huge; I got a small bowl and it was two meals, easy! 

Overall, I would come back."}
{"text":"My first visit! They recognized me as a Newbie as I walked in the door, and were friendly and suggested a combo with the chile relleno I was eyeing. He even offered up a bite of his recommendation at the ordering counter. 

Divey ambience in a GOOD way, off peak hours, and a fair diversity of folks dining in. 

EXCELLENT COMBO! True to the name, I had a Chinese chicken option and a stuffed breaded chile! Black beans and jerk chicken friend rice. Yum!

I'm definitely coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so delicious. I love that they will let you sample stuff if you've never tried it before. One of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I have been to Chino Banditos and when I went on Sunday it was exactly the same. The atmosphere is still the same hole in the wall greatness I can remember. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the #7. I highly recommend this place for the next family and friend get together. You will leave very full and happy!"}
{"text":"Ya not so good. The concept is very creative...asian/Mexican fusion but the flavors were a little awkward. The meats were dry and the food proportions were a little on the light side."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews here on Yelp, I decided this was the restaurant the family would try this last Sat (5/31/08).  Sat night church, followed by dinner has become our family night.

The ordering system does take a little getting used to.  

The kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.

The kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldn't get past the look and texture.  Not sure why, it's not a texture any different than a refried bean, guess I just don't like to see it so dark.

Kids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didn't think the Diablo was too spicy, but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.

We also got big snickerdoodle cookies with our meals.

Consensus was the food was good and we will probably return."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of Chinese food mixed with Mexican? I never did nor had I ever thought of such thing. 

However, Chino Bandido beat me to it. 
Gosh darn; I wish I thought of it first! 

There are several options to choose from; from just your choice of entree by itself to putting it in your quesadilla or burrito or BOTH! What if you don't know how these entrees taste like? No problem, ask for a sample. That's how I made my choice. Did I hear with a side of refried or black beans and rice on the side? Yes you did!  For the rice, you get some more options; fried, plain, jerk, and chicken. To wrap it all up you get to choose either a chocolate volcano (chocolate cookie with powder sugar) or snicker doodle cookie. At the end of it all, you will definitely be really full. I had to take a power nap; haha. 

I had the Jade Chicken (which is the most popular entree on the menu) entree with Jade Chicken quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice. Finishing it all up with a volcano chocolate cookie. I liked the snicker doodler more though (my boyfriend had it) . 

I really like the Jade Chicken. It was freshly made crispy; but there was a little too much sauce. I find the quesadilla very unique. I never had Chinese food with cheese with tortilla before. 
It's all really interesting; got to go try. 

By the way, good luck finding it."}
{"text":"Greatest invention know to man. Their carnitas burrito is something I could eat everyday for the rest of my life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After all the hype, went for a girl's night out.  Food was OK, not what I thought of as outstanding.  They only had plastic forks and knives and I couldn't cut my fried chile relleno with it.  

Food was OK, but my friend's dish was too spicey.  I  have had better food elsewhere, didn't think the Chinese/Mexican combo was all that noticeable.

I also think if they invested in some nice furniture (instead of plastic chairs) and silverware it might be more appealing."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. We went due to all the hype and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"wow.  i had split this plate with my boyfriend. we had the jade red chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans.  nothing dry. nothing stale, just great flavors all around. amazing combination, and it was really, really, delicious.  this was the first time i had chinese x mexican fusion and i feel that i would never find something close to this back in L.A. sad that all the mexican food in L.A. tastes the same to me. though i'm only in arizona to visit my good friend once a year, this is, again, one of the places i must come back to."}
{"text":"Jade Red Chicken, jerk chicken burro. Jerk fried rice.

Thinking about the jade red chicken makes me drool. And the weekend cookies. I've never quite had a oatmeal cookie like that.

There's a ton of food, a ton of combinations, and they serve you quick.

It looks like a dump, but trust me, I'd be here everyday if I could.

JADE RED CHICKEN. I said it again because you must get this."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. If you've never had good chinese or mexican food you'd never know the difference. The food leaned to the very salty and not well prepared. Reminded my a lot Panda Express. The problem with fusion places is like this is they try to do everything and frankly dont do anything well."}
{"text":"The food is an awesome fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. When you get a combo you get a lot of food, enough to share. Ordering can be a but confusing but they are always helpful and they leave you with a complimentary cookie that tastes homemade. I do think it is strange that there is never any music playing in their huge dining area."}
{"text":"Yes, Guy featured it on Food Network. 
His poster, prominantly displayed at the entrance, reminds you of the eatery's 15 minutes of fame.

And yes, guys love this place for some reason. 
I'm not a guy, and I don't love this place. 

The place is dirty. Literally. Look at the floors if you dare.
On top of that, my meatless dinner was bland, and mostly lettuce. I couldn't get out of there quickly enough."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place was over 7 years ago and I was unsure as their interesting combination of Chinese and Mexican food. Now I find myself constantly coming back for more! The best entry is their Jade Red Chicken, it doesn't matter what or how it's served, you always crave more. Great place to eat and very popular as well. I recommend going before noon or after 1:30pm to make sure you can get a seat. However, they do have an option of ordering to go."}
{"text":"The concept is different but the food is very good. The staff is helpful when ordering and giving you options. The fried jerk rice, machaca, red chicken, and cookies are all great. The place has a fun atmosphere. I will be back regularly."}
{"text":"After walking in and stopping to look at at the menu we were asked if it was our first time there.  It was, and we were offered several samples of their top sellers.  Because my gf and I like spicy she brought us some samples of the Diablo Pollo from the kitchen.  Everything we tried was good.  I got the Emerald chicken in a quesadilla and the jade red chick outside, jerk fried rice, and the black beans.    The Emerald chicken quesadilla was a great recommendation. The green onions make the flavor pop.  

2 stars for the great and friendly service.  The chance to try the different dishes before ordering was great and the staff members seemed super nice.  

1 stars for the taste of the food.  It met my expectations

1 star for the price.  It seemed a little pricey for what it is.  The servings seem small for the price, but still was a sufficient serving for me.  

Definitely worth trying if you have not."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! Very unique food but really great and full of flavor! My favorite is the jade chicken it's a bit Spicey but oh so good! It's a bit fat from me but anytime I pass by and it's lunch or dinner time that's what the kids and I have. The dining room is set up like a cafeteria where you seat yorself with your order. It's not a big deal really because the service is fast and the food is always great. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"A local staple. If you're in town, you MUST eat here at least once. Endless combinations of delicious, filling food."}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  For me it is sometimes awesome and other times not. I guess it depends on who is cooking.  All in all I will give it 4 stars. You need to try jade red chicken in a quesadilla."}
{"text":"If I was stoned out of my mind! This place would be the bomb!!  But I was not. So it wasn't. Just a complete disappointment!!! Clean the place up too! I feel like I need a tetanus shot after leaving this place. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow I finally found spicy jerk chicken. Do not...I repeat, do not order the jerk chicken and the red diablo together with jerk fried rice, all were delicious, but together it felt like I had swallowed a live wolverine. I love the combinations here.

the girl got teriaki and red jade chicken which i tried and both were also quite yummy.

The only regret I have is not ordering a dozen snickerdoodles to go. Jesus those things taste like angels! We will be back far too often i am sure."}
{"text":"They make ok Chineese food, if this was a Chineese food restaurant I would rate it meh.

Putting decent Chinese food into a burrito and serving it with fried rice and refried beans makes it very interesting. In the end it was a very enjoyable lunch I would suggest everyone tries out at least once."}
{"text":"Jade chicken with jerk fried rice!

Mexican food and chinese food aren't one of my favorites but Chino Bandido has the perfect mixture of both worlds! What's best is that they give you a free cookie with each meal!"}
{"text":"I sincerely love this place.

My friend Brian recommended we meet up here once when we were both in town. Needless to say, it was a great recommendation!

Although the location is unassuming and rather inconspicuous, don't let the strip mall scare you away. The wonderfully friendly staff and the wide variety of options will make everyone happy, even the vegetarians!

However, you shouldn't come here *just* for the vegetarian options (which I will try eventually, just to see how good they are). This place is excellent for spicy and sweet selections of beef, pork, and chicken, all of which you can sample before you dive in.

I highly recommend getting a combo. You can choose two items, preferred style of rice, and preferred style of beans. The items can either be presented alone or in a burrito or quesadilla. I usually get a quesadilla as one of my items, the pork fried rice, and black beans. It's hard to go wrong with the combo, seriously!

My favorite meat selections are the Chinese BBQ Pork and the machaca. Lately I've been trying other things, but nothing has let me down so far. 

The free cookie is also a big bonus. Love their snickerdoodles! I'm not huge on cookies, but these ones are so soft and so delicious that they are entirely worth getting a half-dozen (or dozen!) to bring home. 

I never seem to finish my combo, as good as it is. It can be a good light lunch for two or just make for excellent leftovers later. 

Also: try going on the weekends sometime - they make different kinds of cookies and also offer a tostada on Sundays and Saturdays!

All in all, I really wish I had this place in San Diego. It'd be a hit, too. But I tend to visit every time I am in Arizona to see my parents, so perhaps that's what keeps it such a great place to return to again and again. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, no?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but wasn't impressive at all. 

The ordering process is a little bit confusing, but the people there are super kind and helpful. Extra star for that.

Besides that, the food is nothing to die for. It worth the stop if you're in the area but definitely wouldn't drive more than 5 miles just to eat there.

Cheers.

PS Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken. Jerk fried rice. Diablo chicken. My regular order

This is the best take out food I've ever had. Besides the garbage plate from back home in western NY. 

Take a few minutes to check out the menu before ordering. You can get the same thing in tons of different ways. Pretty affordable and comes with a snickerdoodle cookie. Quit reading reviews - just order some damn food"}
{"text":"For some reason I had concluded to myself that Chino Bandido was hidden somewhere in a dark crevice off Cave Creek Road in some netherworld north of the Loop 101. 

I sit and type corrected.

After coming across all these Yelp! reviews, I realized that:

A) Chino Bandido is at 19th Ave & Greenway, a short drive from my office and

B) It was just a couple blocks away from the La Quinta Inn where I was holed up for my 2 first weeks in Phoenix last year. However, I didn't know about it then, and had thus concluded that all of Phoenix was an armpit (remember, I only had the immediate surrounding environs of Greenway & the I-17 to go by those days). Back then, I was just getting food poisoning from Souper Salad and Whataburger, when I could have been eating here the whole time. Doh.

But anyway, I decided to go here for lunch today, taking two vegetarian lunch companions with me. We got there (a nondescript stripmall, which makes missing this place while driving past it for 2 straight weeks completely understandable) and noticed that hordes of techie-looking guys dressed in khakis, polo shirts, and IT company badge lanyards were also making their way inside. I then took stock of myself. Khakis? Check. Polo shirt? Check. Company badge lanyard? Check. 

Doh. I was one of them. An autobot. 

But at least an adventerous autobot!

Anyway, I opened the door into complete chaos. The line had stretched all the way to it, and I peeked into the dining area. Completely PACKED with people. It was only 11:40! Needless to say, having a long line gave me time to try and figure out their menu, written on sushi order-style long strips of paper. Eventually as I neared the register (the line moves pretty fast) I decided on the red jade chicken burrito, jerk fried rice, black beans, and veggie salad (the last one just to make me feel a little better about eating the first three). 
My colleagues got the egg foo young with plain fried rice, and chile relleno with plain fried rice as well.

Stepping into the main dining room to get my water from the soda machine, I noticed the decor that everyone was talking about: fold up community center banquet tables, cheap chairs, panda with sombrero mural on the wall...remniscent of a church bingo night, minus the panda. But again, that didn't deter every seat from being occupied. This place was hugely popular. Like local institution popular. I'm not even kidding.

My colleagues and I sat in the smaller adjoining room and wondered how we were going to get our food. Then a spirited server walked in the room carrying a tray full of stuff. \"An order for Jim! An order for Bob! An order for, uh, Sur...Surinder!\" My colleagues and I then debated about this. I'm sure the Chino folks could easily give customers a number to put on their tables a la Pei Wei/Wildflower/many other places, but the whole servers wandering around yelling people's names constantly gave an extra element of atmosphere to the place.

Eventually our food came, along with three aforementioned Snickerdoodles. I poured some of my habanero salsa all over my foil bowl and sampled everything. Beans? Decent. Jerk fried rice? Pretty tasty. Salad? Eh - standard cheap shredded lettuce with shredded cheese on top. But the burrito was interesting. It was effectively sweet & sour chicken (but tastier) rolled up in a tortilla. Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I thought it was a really cool concept. I then noticed other guys getting red jade chicken in quesadilla form, which also looked really good.  I then sat back and surveyed everything in my bowl - a combination of Mexican, Caribbean, and Americanized-Chinese food all mashed up together. Pretty cool, I'd say.

My colleagues enjoyed their food, too, which is always key when carnivores and herbivores can both be satisfied with the same dining location. And when we left the place at 12:30, I'd say the whole place was now 70% empty and completely bereft of khaki pants, which was a little weird. I guess 11:30-12:30 must be the IT golden munching hour.  

I'll definitely come back here to try some more of the combos. It's not the healthiest of eats (pointless coming here if you're on any kind of diet), but for a once in a while inventive, unpretentious lunch treat, this is definitely the place.

4 stars."}
{"text":"After hearing about Chino Bandido for awhile now I decided to go there the other evening. I didn't really know what to expect other than hear people constantly talk about it. When I arrived I had a wonderful woman give me samples of everything on the menu which was a huge bonus because I really had no idea what I wanted. The food was pretty good and if I lived closer I'm sure I would visit again but I can't say that it was worth the drive to go get it. My attitude is if I'm in the area I would go again but it certainly for me is a been there done that."}
{"text":"WTF?  Seriously, WTF!?!?!

I was down in Phoenix for a training session when the trainer mentioned this place that did a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  Being the curious types, my co-worker and I agreed on giving it a try.  

The place is located in a non-descript strip mall in a pretty unassuming part of town.   Luckily, I know not to judge a restaurant by its cover and to trust a local's opinion....and boy I am glad we did.

I tried the jerk chicken rice, a quesadilla, and some sort of Chinese chow mein.  All of the items were great.  Not world class, but tasty and interesting.

A word of warning if you're not going with an expert.  Grab a menu to study as there seem to be a million variations of orders that can be placed on your order sheet.

Definitely a one of a kind place and a worthy stop if you're in that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"You won't eat food like this anywhere else.  Once you figure out the ordering system, the possibilities are endless.  The food isn't the highest quality in terms of ingredients and preparation, but this is a great place to get a quick, unique, and fun meal."}
{"text":"Had to try this place based on lots of positive reviews. My mistake...the food is not good, the place is dirty and overly worn. I don't understand how so many people think this is good food."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a 4 instead of a 5, is they're portions. They pile the rice and beans, which are delicious and especially the Jerk Fried Rice but the actual entree items are quite small. I have been going here for years and it has always been great never a bad meal. For the price I just think there should be better portions"}
{"text":"Chino is the best most unique food joint in the Phoenix area.  I was turned onto it over 10 years ago when I used to golf at the local muni track right across the street.  I now live further away but still eat there every time I'm in the area.

My favorite combo:
1.  jerk chicken
2. chili relleno
refried beans"}
{"text":"Strange, yet amazing combination of Chinese and Mexican. Cheap and good, but maybe not so healthy."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have given it a star if that was an option.  Horrible food!  Jade Red Chicken had a good flavor, but it was extremly greasy and I'm not sure what part of the chiken they used.  Not a very clean looking place.  Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food & great service, especially when I want Mexican and my friends want Chinese. We're all happy !"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's right, count 'em: FIVE STARS. Chino deserves it, it's what your father wants for you, anyone who doesn't agree is a goddamn HATER and you don't need them in your life, etc.

Do people hear \"fusion\" and get all excited, thinking they're in for some fancy treats? Yes, it's REAL gritty, but just look at that spread of reviews and you can tell what's really going on in North Phoenix! Why would you re-review a place if you hated it the first time? 'Cause you're a HATER (Yes, I fully understand how the system works, and I do like that people decided to give Chino another chance, but I'm kind of on a rant here so please forgive me. Also, at Chino Bandido it's not quite a love-it-or-hate-it situation because that means the reviews would be 50/50, and that is obviously not the case), that's why! 

Order this combo: 8 & 10Q with BLK & JFR, and if you still think it's terrible then you HATE America and HATE Phoenix and I feel real sorry for you and your neglected taste buds.

plus there's Jenga, and snickerdoodles so..."}
{"text":"Jerky fried rice, bbq pork and mexican burrito-quesadilla, all in one plate! Mexi-chinese food is the new unique concept and worth a try !"}
{"text":"After the Chandler Chino's closed down, I was devastated. 

That meant I had to drive an hour, one way, to reach reach the original heavenly palace aka Chino Bandido. 

My mainstay combo is the jade & emerald chicken, in quesadillas, with any beans and jerk chicken fried rice.

What are you waiting for? go!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on my wife's recomendation. Rice was not cooked fully and not hot. Chicken Terriyaki was limp and warm. Chicken tatsed like it came from a can. Not real impressed. However the Snickerdoodle cookie was most tasty. Maybe you all should pursue baking..............

Thanks

{"text":"Hmm Mexican or Chinese food...ok both! Yep I did it again, found Chino Bandido where they combine both! Super good and sorry I didn't come up with that idea earlier. A must stop in Phoenix, AZ! Pollo Diablo and Jade Red Chicken with Fried Rice and Refried Beans would be a good start! 

Great Fast Food, Great Takee-Outee or Eat-in, something different and something for everyone. F.A.S.T. Review speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Not exactly the nicest place in town, but its cheap, interesting, really good food.  The atmosphere is very casual and low key, and they let you sample all their meats & rice up front which I thought that was way cool. The beans are delicious, and so are those big snicker-doodle cookies that come withe the meals.  Thank you Triple D for introducing me to yet another local grub spot."}
{"text":"I went here after seeing this restaurant featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Drives.  I wasn't quite sure about the mixture of Mexican and Chinese food...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is a little confusing, but the girl at the counter was helpful in explaining it.  There was plenty of food and it was tasty!.....One of my creations was the carnitas in a quesadilla.......Mmmmmmm.....try it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Food is great and service is fast! You'll get in and out quickly with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"One of my goals whenever I visit Phoenix is to eat all the things at all the places, Chino Bandito is my favorite place to eat in the Western Hemisphere since El Camino was vanquished in Louisville, Kentucky.  This is the mountaintop of restaurants for me not just because I love the food but also because it's filled with happy and poignant memories.  

Chino Bandito, as the other reviews will elucidate, is a place where Chinese and Mexican food are brought together in excellent fusion cuisine.  When I lived in Phoenix I'd vary my order once a week to try new things, a man was saying when I was there last time that there are over eighty thousand combinations of food here.  I would love to try all of them. 

When I am limited to an annual visit I have the Jade Chicken, BBQ Pork, and fried rice.  I also have the beans that are spicy and delicious.  Vicki had the Jade Chicken and fried rice, she has lost weight and I am looking for it.  The food has the delightful quality of filling you up at a reasonable price, tasting great, and being reasonably 'good' for you all things considered. The spicy is spicy enough to enjoy, doesn't overstay it's welcome, and doesn't visit again later.  

I also love, love, love their snicker doodle which is a better cookie than the ones my great grandmother made for me - there is no internet in Heaven so I'm confident she won't hear about it.  At least for a while. 

And kids, the place isn't fancy - you seat yourself, you fill your own drink, and some nice young person brings you your food.  It's super casual but I've learned that fancy digs aren't exactly indicators of quality food and service."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  My fiancee is a huge fan of this place and will be back for sure.  So it's like a Mexican and Asian fusion with some Jamaican flare.  They have a lot of dishes and you can combine the different flavors.  The only complaint is the ordering can get a little confusing.  I remember ordering a dish on the card and what came out was something different from what I was expecting.  Regardless it was good and delicious.  My lady loves the Emerald Chicken and Polo Diablo, which were good, but I really enjoy the jade chicken and chinese bbq pork.

Overall they have a good variety of different flavors.  You can get bowls, burritos, and quesdillas.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and the service is excellent. The employees are really helpful finding you somethin you'll like if you're a first time customer. It is very popular so it can get pretty busy but the delicious food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical coming here but my boyfriend really wanted to check it out. I would give this place 5 stars only because the girl in the front was so nice and patient. She had long wavy hair and took control of the convo in a good way. She even asked for me if the veggies could be grilled and \"manager\" said no. It's not the hard to grill veggies. Any who my dad didn't think the BBQ pork was good and my boyfriend like jade chicken! The Cuban beans were my favorite. I would recommend this place only if you're around the area. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Alright, so the Jerk chicken sounds good, but it's bland.
The white rice isn't cooked right, so it's going to be worth it to spend the extra seventy-five cents to get fried rice.

The black beans are DAMN GOOD. I don't like beans in general, but these black beans have a super delicious flavor and I could eat them all day.

If I liked orange chicken I would like the Jade chicken because the flavor is nice, but I just don't like that fried texture.

Mmmmmm Mmmmmmm GOOD.

OH and if it is your first time there, let them know and they will give you samples and explain how to order, etc."}
{"text":"Wow, what a unique place. Did you know it was on Guy's Food Network show about diners, drive-ins, and dives?!

As a vegetarian, my options were limited but I knew that going into it. You can ask for a vegetarian menu at the front and they'll give you a separate veg menu (though....know that it is limited unfortunately). 

Such a unique idea - Asian and Mexican fusion!? Unfortunately, I didn't really get to experience the \"fusion\" as a vegetarian. The black beans and cheese side, though, was INCREDIBLE - so much flavor. I also had the quesadillas, and then chile relleno which was super tasty and was coated in....I think....Frosted Flakes?? Or something like that...

Such a cool place - worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went and tried the jade chicken in a burrito and a carnitas quesadilla, black beans and rice. My favorite thing here was actually the snickerdoodle cookie they serve with the meal. The carnitas were dry and the jade chicken tasted funky in a burrito. I tried it without the tortilla and it was OK but several bites had gristle. The beans were good. The tables were all dirty though the place wasn't crowded. I tried the plum dipping sauce and it really didn't work with anything on my plate so I'm not sure what it's intended for. I think that this is a good concept (Mexican/Asian fusion) but poor execution."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue as I visited Chino Bandido back in July, but I will preface it with this: I am still dreaming about the black beans consumed here. And to still be fantasizing about falling face first into a plate of these beans really just baffles me. And makes me sad that I don't live closer.

The ordering process was confusing, but the friend I went with knew the system and would have been able to make it happen. However, it was a little slow when we went in and the cashier not only took our order, she let me sample anything I wanted to try after my friend told her it was our first time eating there. They get one star alone for that! I ended up with a jerk chicken quesadilla which was the perfect combination of cheese, spice and crisp tortilla. I will analyze the crap out of a quesadilla because it's one of my four child-like food groups and this was the Rolls Royce of quesadillas. It wasn't overly greasy as quesadillas tend to be (you can't avoid it...I mean essentially it's just melted fat), the cheese was melted perfectly and the jerk chicken brought the heat without sacrificing flavor.

 I think I got some kind of chicken (jade chicken?) as well which I remember being good, but not as good as the black beans. Oh the beans.  Did you know that magic beans aren't just a key proponent to a much-loved children's story? They are also on the menu at Chino Bandido and served in almost gargantuan portions. They're kind of sweet, savory and the texture is so smooth, almost like a bean dip. It's sprinkled with cheese and can honestly be eaten as a meal itself (which I'm totally tempted to do next time). I didn't finish the rest of my food, but did use my tortilla scraps to scrape up every bit of that glorious bean concoction!

The portions are overwhelming to say the least, so I think you get what you pay for plus some. I was so full after that I was ready to petition for a nap room in the restaurant and was really glad I wasn't the one driving afterwards! The service was great and they have a pretty huge space, so if you do find yourself needing to lay across 3 chairs after eating you might have that option if the restaurant is slow. 

Chino Bandido is great for reasonably priced, hearty eats that will make your tastebuds happy and possibly induce a Rip Van Winkle-like nap!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandito is by far one of my favorite places to eat. I seriously go out of my way to make a stop there. I have been eating at Chino's for 9 years and I doubt I will ever stop going! They have two locations in the valley and I have been to both more times than I can recall. Both are excellent options for your first visit to Chinos. If you want to get lunch I would recommend that you get there early because this place gets crowded during lunch. Chino's has some very loyal fans and a somewhat complicated system for ordering. The best part is that the staff is always so helpful and attentive. They will walk you through the ordering process as many times as you desire. 

The portions are huge and the cost isn't bad either. Plan to spend about 8 or 10 bucks per person and you will probably have leftovers. The staff is exceptionally helpful, and will take the time to give you a sample of every single item on the menu before you ever spend a dime! I don't know of any other restaurant in the world that gives out this much free food (samples). I personally recommend the black beans with the pork-fried rice paired with a jade red chicken quesadilla and a jen red pork burrito. This is my usual at Chinos although I have tried nearly every side and entre on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is soooo good. I love the fact that this company obviously employs high school students. Pleasant place to eat and be served.
The menu isn't as confusing as it seems, just take a paper menu and sit at one of the tables for a few mins."}
{"text":"Drove by dozens of times before ever trying it.  The guy behind the counter was super patient explaining whatever we wanted to know, he also offered us samples of a few items so we could make our decision easier.  The food was good, very filling.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken and Jerk chicken! Yum! That is all I have to say! Oh and the black beans! :)"}
{"text":"this place was pretty tasty. had no idea the chandler location had been around for 6-7 years. as a first timer, i was allowed to try samples just like other reviewers said. the cashier also helped me to fill out the order form. Emerald chicken, Red June chicken, and the jerk chicken were deee-lish. 

if you're curious, give this place a try. you will be rewarded with a delicious snickerdoodle that comes with your meal =)"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on triple D and I love it!  Kudos on the Emerald Chicken and Jade Red Chicken.  Mexican - Asian fusion combines two of my favorite cuisines and its budget friendly.  It doesn't get any better than this :)"}
{"text":"This Mexican/Asian restaurant was the focus of a show on the Food Channel. You will be astounded!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come out to Phoenix I come to Chino Bandidos it's amazing! Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Chicken ftw!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great bang for the buck, though not really legit fusion food.

Food:
-Decent jade red chicken, but basically tasted like good version of your typical sweet and sour chicken
-Four kinds of fried rice that also tasted straight from a Chinese restaurant everywhere

Decor:
-Dirty cafeteria style with a giant mexican panda statue, which I didn't really find that endearing or understand with its thick belt of bullets

Other than the snickerdoodle cookie (which I thoroughly and guiltily enjoyed) rather than a fortune cookie, Chino Bandido is basically Panda Express with more samples."}
{"text":"Overall I am disappointed. I'm not sure if all the reviews built me up for a let down by setting such high expectations or if I just caught them on a bad day. First of all as soon as I walked in I wanted to walk out just based on the appearance and cleanliness. It has not been updated in what looks like -ever. They weren't helpful in the method of ordering as some customers took to a counter to fill out a slip while other walked straight up to the counter. We placed our order and continued to the dinning room which was even messy and the floors were sticky. It just seems like none of the employees care to make sure things look clean. The food was just okay nothing exceptional. I tried 3 dishes the jade red chicken, bbq pork, and the chili relleno with the plain fried rice. The chicken was the best of the 3 but probably not good enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the early 90's, though haven't for a few years. Went back the other day, ordered Jade, Jerk Quesadilla, and double black beans with a volcano.  Same as before. Perfect."}
{"text":"Chino is great. My fave is the emerald chicken and egg foo yung. Listen people, it's all about the food! It's fresh, not frozen like one of the other reviewers insinuated. The Refried beans are BLACK Refried beans and they're freakin' addicting. Yes, it's a little messy at lunch time, but it's like a feeding frenzy at noon! They're getting the food out to hungry white collars, blue collars, golfers etc , they're not trying to white glove the place!  If you have a closed mind you'll be disappointed :-)
And for the reviewer who compared it to Chipotle....you're high to even put them in the same review.  
chipotle=chain
Chino=It's yummy, trust me."}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I've been here, but I just recommended my brother head over today for lunch on a business trip and it reminded me of how good this place is.  I've read through the reviews below, and I get that not every place is for everybody, there will always be haters and complainers, but complaining that a place makes you burp?  Or saying Orange Chicken doesn't belong in a Quesadilla?!?!?   One, take a Zantac before you go eat if you're worried about burps.  Frankly, I like burping and in some cultures, I would argue ours even, burping is a sign of satisfaction after a meal!  next, if you don't want orange chicken in a quesadilla?  Don't order it?!?!  Pretty easy fix, if you ask me.

Anyway, the food here is SO good, I love it, I go every time I'm in Chandler!  The fun mix of Chinese and Mexican makes for interesting and delicious mixtures.  If you want something safe, go with the Chile relleno quesadilla - freakin amazing, IF you're not avers to a little spice and/or lactose intolerant as the amount of cheese on this thing is borderline obscene (in a good way).  The Jade Red Chicke in delish, the fried rice is amazing, honestly I haven't had a bad thing at this place.

Bottom line, ignore the few haters and go in with a little bit of adventure.  Pay attention when they take you through the choices and ENJOY it. It's delish.  Totally 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great, creative food especially if you like spicy. This spot is a good mixture of cultures and quickly becoming one of our favorites. You'll definitely get a filling meal for a low cost."}
{"text":"I absolutely cannot even begin to experts in woods how incredibly amazingly awesomely delicious this place is. I was looking for something different and flavorful, which can bed hard in my area of town. I found this place and I was in heaven. Not to mention the customer service is outstanding, it being my first time I had no idea what to get but they were patient and explained to me the various options.

I recommend this place... for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Dont be scared this place is awesome. The different flavors explode in your mouth. Id give 5 stars if they would make ordering easier!! It is very overwhelming and confusing unless your a regular. Free snickerdoodles with your meal :)"}
{"text":"The ONLY thing worth the calories was the Snickerdoodle cookie!
Ordered the machaca beef in a quesadilla (very salty and not very flavorful)
Jerk fried rice (it was cold and bland)
Chile Rellano (filled with Cheddar cheese--seriously! and coated in what looked like ritz crackers, no sauce topping)

My parents ordered the egg foo young and didn't receive the gravy on top, they had to ask for it and when they received it, it looked more like snot (it was clear and not very gravy like).
I was pretty disappointed to find out Guy Fieri from Diners Drive In's and Dives gave this place two thumbs up. I have also dined at Joe's Farm Grill that he also visited and will not suggest that place to anyone either. I'm starting to wonder about that show..."}
{"text":"I decided to have dinner here because it was close to the office and I was really intrigued by the idea of Mexican/Chinese fusion.

The staff was very helpful - they literally teach you how to order - and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Red Jade Chicken (in a burrito) and the Carnitas (in a quesadilla), with the Jerk Fried Rice and the black beans.  Now, if you're thinking that Jerk seasoning isn't Mexican OR Chinese... maybe you're not Chino Bandido material.  

They also brought out a free snickerdoodle with my meal, which was so good that I wrapped half of it in a napkin and put it in my purse like somebody's grandma."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Try the emerald chicken inside a quesadilla, it is amazing. I knocked a star off because the restaurant itself is very run down and the roof looks as if it could collapse any day now. The restroom is unisex and is extremely hot, temperature wise. I know it's Arizona but it was hotter in that restroom than outside. Other than that the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, it combines chinese, mexican, and caribbean. It's a novelty place and the food is greasy/heavy, but it is fun and locally owned.

I like the emerald chicken burrito and the jade red chicken quesadilla. My favorite part of the meal is the free snickerdoodle."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chino a few times a month for about a year. In that year, the place has gotten cleaner, and the food has gotten better. The staff is just as nice, and prices are still the same. 

Many of the 1 star reviews say that the place was a \"shit hole\" and dirty. This is true, it is a dive. And with dives you get a dirty shit hole. However, in the last year they have really turned around the cleanliness. So if you think it's dirty, then you would have been appalled last year.

Their food is good. Good. Watch Guy during DDD. He isn't as ecstatic as he usually is. That's because the food is good. You can get good Mexican food anywhere, and great Mexican is easy to find. You can get good Chinese food anywhere, and great is easy to find as well. But you can't get good Chinese, Mexican, Cuban, Jamaican fusion anywhere.

Seriously, the jerk fried rice here would put the cast of Cool Runnings into a nostalgic food coma. 

But sadly, even though the staff is excellent, the place is cleaner, and the fusion unique, the food is just, good. Some things can be bland (emerald chicken, white rice) and other things can be amazing (ruby chicken, black beans), but it's not all the best of its kind.

To really get the most out of the place, you need to try a few different meals. Find your combo and make it as unique as you. This place, while not Gusteau's, but it has it's charm. It is worth trying a few times, even if your first experience was bad.

On one last note, I am not saying anything about the menu other than get help from the great staff, it's freaking confusing at first.

Eat on!"}
{"text":"Green emerald and the jade red chicken was delicious. Their green onion ginger sauce is spot on. I will be back before I leave Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Well, you definitely don't come here for the glamours decor. In fact, the place looks a bit run down, but its not dirty, as the bathrooms were spotless. Therefore, don't knock this place for it's looks, the food was pretty good! As others have noted, the ordering process is somewhat unclear. Still, after a couple minutes contemplating the menu, I ordered a bowl of half jade red chicken and the other half jerk chicken. Both chickens were tasty and flavorful, with a kick of spice too! I preferred the jade red chicken, though. Would come back to sample their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! I had the Jade chicken in a quesadilla, BBQ pork, jerk rice and black beans. Loved everything! The Jade chicken had such a sweet flavorful glaze and the tortilla on the quesadilla was really nice and cruchy. There was plenty of cheese too. I also really recommend the jerk chicken, very tasty. The meal also comes with a snicker doodle cookie which was nice and soft and warm. I loved it. Even the fountain drinks were good. I liked how they had about 3 or 4 sugar free options. I had the pink Sobe drink. Really refreshing on a hot day. The staff was also super helpful and walked us through the ticket process. I live out of state but if ever I'm in Phoenix again, I'd gladly go back."}
{"text":"Soooo good! And you have plenty of leftovers and they still taste as yummy. Quick service too."}
{"text":"I sent my fiance to CB for the first time with 15 minutes to spare before their 9pm closing time. Boy am I glad he made it in time! I had seen reviews and heard about this place on various websites describing it as a \"must try.\" When I saw that you could turn your Asian entree into either a quesadilla or a burrito I was sold. I knew this place was a foodie heaven must try.

Since there were four of us at home waiting for the take out, the fiance arrived back home with 2 two item combos and 2 rice bowls. The rice bowls had the most popular Jade Red Chicken which tasted like a spicier orange chicken. The two item combo was a feast of new and unusual delights with a Jade Red Chicken quesadilla and a Chile Relleno burrito. Ummm...orange chicken in a cheesy melt quesadilla? Sweet! Deep fried crispy chile relleno in a burrito? Ah-mazing! Add to that the Cuban style black beans and the Jerk Chicken Fried Rice and the four of us were happy campers. 

I know this is a place we will be frequenting again b/c we were already talking about other items and combinations we would try. It's definitely the type of hole in the wall, so bad for you it's good type food that one craves every now and then. 

PS: I can't forget to mention the softest, airy and not overly sweet Snickerdoodle cookie that comes with every combo meal. After the bold flavors of the Asian/Mexican/Carribean meal it is the perfect way to please the sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I've found people either love or hate this place. I love it. Great food. Good portions!  Always friendly service."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than a star I would....I was talked into meeting some friends here who swear by this place and I left deathly I'll and barely made it home to spend the next hour of my life in the bathroom thinking I was dying.  I did not learn my lesson...I gave it another shot this time I gave up and asked for a refund, was denied... NEVER again!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I hated it. The second time I loved it.

The jerk chicken rice and black beans is the best thing on the planet, but  the meat is notsogood here. The flavor is great, but the meat itself is so cafeteria quality cheap that it ruins it.

Great concept. Almost awesome. Get better product and you win."}
{"text":"How couldl you not love this place?  It is awesome!  Now is it fancy or healthy or super nice elegant...no!  But it is not supose to be...it is suppose to be a casual place with awesomely delicious comfort Chinese and Mexican food!  This food will add to your waste line so if you do not want to do that then I would keep this place on your guilty pleasure list!  I wish I could eat whatever I want all the time but I cannot!  My favorite is the red jade chicken in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk chicken fried rice!  UMMMMMMM...can you say yummy???  I have been here several times and everytime its still greasy and good!  I introduced this place to my coworkers and they love it too!  I get the same thing everytime because its that good!!!  Trust me you will be in some heaven when you try it!   Plus you get a cookie with each combo!  The snickerdoodle one is great!"}
{"text":"NO. Don't go. I thought it was a great concept but their implementation of the Mexican/Asian idea was far from meeting any kind of expectations. I wanted to be able to come in and look at a menu and order easily and quickly. Instead, the girl said not to look at their menu up on the wall because it wasn't the real one. HUH???? Instead we should look at this laminated picture thingy she held out to us that explained the various plates and sides, etc. and told us we needed to sample each little dish before deciding. I had no time to do any such silly thing! 

I lost my patience so I just ordered a quesadilla and then sat down to wait for Eric to finish his order. He ordered some weird combo dish for himself that actually wasn't too bad. The place itself was a little strange. It was almost as though they had very first opened their doors hastily without finishing the details... the \"fake\" misleading menu, for one; and the lack of decor, for two. A few objects here and there suggested it was a mix of Hispanic and Asian, but it just felt empty and had no character or enthusiasm. Especially in the folks taking orders."}
{"text":"The selection can be a bit overwhelming, but take your time. They are generous with the samples!!! You cannot go wrong . All the flavors are unique and once you get your favorite combination figured out you will crave this place."}
{"text":"Yes, this place lives up to the hype. My Jade red chicken did not taste fresh, but it was still pretty good. The jerk chicken quesadilla was superb, and I'm not exaggerating when I proclaim the cuban black beans were the best beans I've had in my life. ... Really, my only regret is that I can't go to Chino Bandidos more often on account of my living in Albuquerque."}
{"text":"Love the jade chicken with rice! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm! Also I'm a big fan of any restaurant that has Mountain Dew...plus! Guys are always funny and helpful."}
{"text":"Not So Hot... I see a ton of really positive reviews so I think ok must be awesome food,  it must have been and off day for the whole experience or the reviews are posted buy shills... because Im not going to ever return to this DIVE, I can get past the run down decor and mix match seating or the way open dining concept with the pitiful wall art  or the unclean bathrooms (keeping and open mind) that is just superficial stuff that should not get in the way of awesome food & I like the Mexican Chinese food combinations the concept is a pretty cool idea i was impressed by that,  but  the food holy mother of yuck I was not impressed at all...! & staff just don't give a crap if your new or not so they offer no advice on anything YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, the food was dry, over seasoned salted to death...like the cook must be a smoker kind of salted its bad, I had the emerald chicken it was in the trash after the first bite...the green in the emerald part  ..??wow what a disappointment  it was only ground up over salted green onions dry topping not even a sauce of any kind it was gross..and whats with the over salting everything damn I mean really..my kid had the teriyaki chicken he ate the rice tossed the chicken it was dry and so over salted from the sauce he couldn't eat it, so maybe the tasty reviews are just people that think salty is a flavor??? the beans well if you can get past the salt..they were ok, the RICE was good, my husband had something edible after you peeled off the way to thick batter the Chile relleno with teeny tiny little Chile and a un-relleno (chile relleno should be stuffed not puffed),   the the rest of the experience was all about the sticky floor under carbonated soda and not one single lid to fit the med cups..? & I noticed the cost was way to much to pay for what you got in portion size too I mean really a cup of rice and a few chunks of chicken & a cup of pureed green onions for 8 bucks with no other sides really!!! but we had plenty of \"unsalted\" napkins, if you come here expecting a unique dining experience there is nothing unique here but if you insist then by all means knock yourself out, but for me I'll stick with a Freebirds or Cuccas  style food..."}
{"text":"What can you say about this place? The restaurant is not nice, the neighborhood is not great and it's not that close to where I live. Now with that being said, I love this place! Always tasty, always consistent and you could literally get something different everyday of the week for an entire year and never have the same thing twice. One of my favorite places to eat ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty great place for Chinese-Mexican fusion. 

Would definitely recommend trying their Jade Red Chicken first, as it is really popular. I always end up getting just one item, since that's pretty filling for me, but if you have a big appetite, would recommend getting the one with two items.

Overall, I've tried various meats and all of them are pretty good. Really can't go wrong. 

Anyway, the menu can be confusing the first time you come here, but they have people who will help you out. You just fill out this sheet, then pay for it at the counter, and then go and sit and someone will bring out your food to you.

They have quite a few tables, but wouldn't recommend coming here with a group of more than six."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and I've come here for years.  My boyfriend also can never get enough of this place.  I love the fact that its unique to Phoenix which is why I always take visitors here.  They are also generous with samples.  I would not change anything about the food.  I wish the ambiance was a little nicer though.  Maybe a repainted wall here or there or new tables or chairs??"}
{"text":"I don't even remember who introduced me to Chino Bandido, but I owe them a debt of gratitude. For years it was like this secret club that if you were in the know, you were among a small group. I'm super happy that they have been getting a lot of press and TV coverage the last few years, but their popularity has become a double edged sword since even when I call 20 minutes ahead I wait 20 minutes after arriving. Worth the wait!

The best advice I can give someone who has never been is to go with an open mind and don't be afraid to try everything at least once!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give a 4.5! Came here for the first time with my roommate and the employees were really nice and helpful. We did not realize there were papers we had to fill out but there guy who helped us could tell we were new and helped us out right away. We got to sample some stuff and he gave great suggestions! I went pretty plain with the jade red chicken and pork fried rice but my roommate got the machaca and jerk fried rice. We both LOVED our food! We took it Togo and it worked perfectly. Looks can be deceiving because this is a definite hole in the wall which I am ok with. The only thing keeping me from giving five stars was that the dinning room was a bit dirty. I'm not the kind of person to knock a place for decor. The restaurant was pretty busy so I understand but there were a lot of straw wrappers and what not on the floor so a simple sweeping would have gone a long ways. 

Do I plan on coming back? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype! The most surprising food hits your taste buds and it's amazing!!!! Anything here is bomb!"}
{"text":"So good! Strange combinations, but amazing!  I had the Diablo chicken, Jade chicken burrito, chicken fried rice and black beans combo. Wife had Chinese BBQ pork bowl with pork fried rice. We both loved it! The black beans may have been the star. This is hangover/diet busting food at its best! And, you get a cookie! Will definitely be back (soon)!"}
{"text":"I like this place the food is a weird mix.  Asian and Latin influence mixed together.  My wife says it's too many flavors but I thinks it's pretty good.  Too expense for lunch great for dinner."}
{"text":"So freaked out right now. We asked for a lime with the corona and after working the register, he grabbed the limes with his dirty fingers. After the chef heard that we put a happy hour order in, he screamed 'no more happy hour' and started banging things around. Then the order came out with refried beans instead of black beans. Fly's are buzzing all around our food. I am too freaked out to eat this and just spent  $17.46. Should I risk it, and try this food?"}
{"text":"NOOOOO!   Why did you close???? Now I have to drive 70 miles round trip for that amazing jade red chicken....  Please reconsider and open back up.... I'm considering selling the Porsche and buying a Prius just to afford the gas to drive across town for my chinos fix."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about the venue but the food is delicious!! If you love traditional, uncomplicated Mexican food with an Asian twist then you're in the right spot!! I recommend the diablo chicken."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The lady that gave me the samples were super nice, the food tasted pretty good as the samples.  The whole idea is very interesting.  I truly wanted to like this place.

I ordered the diablo chicken in a cheese quesadilla and the red jade chicken in a burrito.  I chose to go with the jerk fried rice and refried beans.  

So, the food came and looked pretty good, and a lot for the price.  But it just didnt taste all that great.  The red jade chicken was just the meat wrapped in a tortilla.  Nothing else in the \"burrito\".  The meat was all questionable... when I order chicken I like to see whole pieces of white meat, not grey/clear meat covered in batter.  The diablo chicken was kind of odd with the cheese.  The only thing that tasted fantastic was the snickerdoodle that came with the meal.

So the meal was just so-so... then I got back to the office... bad times ahead followed by another bad time at home.  Something just didn't sit right.  I can't recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy an personal opera show in the bathroom."}
{"text":"This place is is fun. It features two of my favorite foods on 1 plate, At first I thought it was a crazy idea but said hey let's give it a try. They let you sample everything on the menu before you order. I liked that. i did not like how you order your food. A bit confusing but so worth it in the end! I ordered the jade red chicken with pork fried rice and a side jade red chicken quesadilla....wow. So delicious! The service was pretty good as well. I have been back many times with my boyfriend. The only complaint is their location. It is very hard to find, but when you do I promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is original but not above and beyond. I have been there twice and have no urge to go back. I only likes 2 of the items on their menu and it's not worth the trip when there is so much better food near by. Dinning room was clean but very outdated."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. My husband and I have heard such great things about this place, so we decided to try it. I don't know if it was because we ate there later in the day or what, but it wasn't good. I ordered the Pollo diablo with white rice. The chicken was super dry, and there wasn't really any onion to speak of. I think I got the last of what was left because 1/3 of it was just crunchy batter. My husband got the jerk chicken burro combo with sweet and sour chicken, rice and beans. The beans were partially burnt and were also dry. The sweet and sour chicken had a weird flavor and the jerk chicken burro was leaking grease all over. My husband did say the cookies were awesome. I"}
{"text":"Quite some time ago I saw this place on Travel Channel's top 50 unique places to eat, or something like that. The idea of a fusion of Oriental and Mexican food intrigued me. knowing that I would not be going to Phoenix any time soon, I put it in the back of my mind.

Ended up in Phoenix on business and needed to find a place to eat. The back of my mind reminded me of some place with Mexican/Oriental fusion. searched Yelp and came up with Chino Bandido and it was only 4 miles from my hotel.

I wanted to experience as many flavors as possible so I ordered an al la cart carnitas burrito & a combination bowl with Jade chicken, chile relleno, jerk chicken fried rice and Cuban black beans. I wish I could have ordered more, but the portion sizes are too big and I would have been miserable, because I would have eaten every bite. The chile relleno was fantastic. the crispy exterior was so unique.

WOW! the flavors exploded in my mouth. The food was great!

The thing that impressed me more than the food was the service. If any one wants an example of  great customer service for a model for their own business after, even without eating a bite of the delicious food a visit to Chino Bandido is would be worth the trip. The staff's compensation is either based on the the satisfaction of the clientele of they are part owners, because everyone of them acted as if it was their business. It was my first visit and I did not know the menu or how to order. No problem. I was greeted by friendly staff who directed me to a line of neophytes. when it was my turn the young lady asked me  some questions and then offered bites of different menu items & explained some of the many options available for me to order. I even had to ask her to cut down the size of the samples so that I would not fill up before ordering.

My only regret is not being able to go back and order some of the menu items I was unable to try.

The 4\" snicker-doodle cookie was a very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Chino Bandito is the ultimate lovechild between Mexican and Chinese food...and tastes even better than the combo sounds. Kind of a hole in the wall, but in the best kind of way. 

Order at the counter using paper slips, and don't forget to stop by the sampling area on the far left if it's your first time...they'll let you taste everything before you order. One of the best parts...you can get anything on the menu in quesadilla form. The fresh baked cookie you get with every meal is a huge plus too.

Jerk fried rice, black beans, emerald chicken, and jade red chicken quesadillas are my go to."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was small enough to play on the Panda! Look forward to fit every time I'm in the area and there's times I make the 30min commute just to satisfy my Chino Bandido craving!
Jerk fried rice is a must *it is a little extra $ but just change 
Every main dish is great and the beans are so smooth and flavorful. I rarely like my food to touch as it compromises individual flavor. Any dish here you could eat items individually or all mashed together with er way it phenomenal, it's a little restaurant in a questionable strip mall but they produce magic food that's will bring joy to your tastebuds! If it's your 1st time I recommend you go on a weekend so you can get their chocolate cookie, Yum!
It's a little pricey but in comparison to the portions, I can eat on my bowl w/ 2 meats for 2 days. I just have to tell my brain to stop eating or I stuff myself it's soooo good! 
Staff is always friendly and never seems unhappy to be there, very nice energy in this place. Life long favorite of the valley"}
{"text":"Most of the time I go the food is great. Not over cooked. Just the right amount of sauce. I usually get the emerald chicken, and the jerked pork.  Friendly staff. Clean environment. But the last two times I went the chicken was dry like its been sitting to long. The pork had very little sause, and the rice was old and crunchy. The portions were smaller. The guy behind the counter was a bit rude, and the lobby was a mess. Hope this is not a new trend. I have been a loyal customer for years. Hope you guys shape back up. Hate to loose one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I will admit that the place is kind of run down but I always get my food to go so it doesn't bother me. Their cookies are amazing! Probably the best cookies I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Jade chicken, jerk fried rice... need I say more? If you can get passed the \"complicated\" way of ordering, then you will fall in love with this place. I don't even want to ruin it for you, just go here and try it out."}
{"text":"This place is my church... I love coming here religiously on the weekends for lunch. You can't beat the selection, quality and flavor of everything on the menu.

It's tough to decide between Chino and Tacos Atoyac... so I usually end up having two lunches whenever I go :)"}
{"text":"I saw Chino Bandido on triple D and had to try it.  

The appearance is not fancy...looks like a regular Chinese take-out place except the inside is very spacious and has a lot of seating.  I loved the cute panda paintings on the walls with Mexican hats XD

The service was great, especially by the person who takes your order.  He is so willing to help you figure out what you wanna order and give you lots of samples.  I loved the emerald chicken, and red chicken.  

I wish I had ordered the bigger plate and shared with my husband.  I ordered one entre with rice so I could not really try the effect of combining Chinese and Mexican food.  I wish I had ordered quesadillas.

I will come back next time in Phoenix.

*Featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."}
{"text":"This Asian fusion place is so good I wish there were more locations especially in Tempe. The drive is worth it for the food and the cookies. The fried rice with jerk chicken and cheese quesadilla is what I recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here, it will most certainly not be my last. A good change from the norm with tasty entrees."}
{"text":"My husband took me here the other day and I was amazed!! First, if your a newbie, you get to sample most of their menu items BEFORE you order.

The black beans are bursting with flavor and the emerald chicken is a must EAT! You even get a fresh cookie for your sweet tooth and I think this cookie (snickerdoodle) was better than Paradise Bakery! 

Diners drive ins and dives came here and Guy loved it!! This place is tucked away from the main street, but it's worth finding your way here.. Only con is that it's set up like a school lunch room. I continue to come here for the black beans and chicken. YUM"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.

I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.

The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."}
{"text":"So I finally went to Chino's. Though it didn't start off all that good, me being overly hungry didn't help this, but still, it ending well, with a cookie and a smile.

We walked into the open and airy joint and where we found a huge front counter and the two owners (I know what they look like because I saw them on the food network show they were in) were assisting new customer by allowing them to sample some of their fairs,  this is all good, but we had 5 VERY finicky people in front of us...One was pregnant, one was a vegetarian, one had to return to work (didn't want stinky breath, whatever happend to gum) so every other thing that was brought out for them to taste was conversely turned away. FINALLY, after waiting at the counter for a good ten minutes, I just grabbed our order form and went to the check out. I was than first asked, is this your first time here, so I replied \"yes\" and one of the owners (the lady) said \"so, do you like spicy or mild foods\" and by now I am mildly starving, and replied shortly \"I don't know, I just want some food.\" Now, I know there is much appeal about the \"experience\" of having the two owners hand feed you some of their most delicious creations, but there is no order or direction at this large counter, and this can be frustrating. Spending 10 minutes with three people and letting a line build up (on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm) with no one else directed to help isn't really a great idea...Hey but that's just me...

Anyhow, I ordered the Jade Red Chicken and Jerk fried Rice, my other half ordered Jerk chicken with chicken fried rice. Just FYI the Jerk is really spicy I mean, 1000 little men in your mouth lighting torches spicy. My other half couldn't tell the difference between the peanut butter and snicker doodle cookies spicy (this was comedic however). But the flavor was very good in all the choices we made, I will be returning to Chino's for my personal tasting \"experience\"!"}
{"text":"Cant say enough about how much i love this place. Everything is good. Dont expect luxury scenery just DAMN GOOD FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Lots of people rave about this place. Even saw the show on tv. So I tried it.

Food was average/below average. Served my dish before others that ordered before me. Though wow that was fast! But then realized why. Ordered the BBQ Pork and Machaca. Both were dry with minimal flavor. The cookie was a nice treat and very tasty. Got the volcano cookie.

Service was good.
Price was high for what they offer. Food above and 2 Coronas = $20
Decor minimal.

Would return with someone that wants to try it but will never have any cravings for Chino Bandido food."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from watching Diners Drive-ins and Dives. You know, one of those local joints that Guy Fieri raves about....This is their second location. It's tucked in the way back of a strip mall. Your GPS may lead you to the wrong location just an FYI. After finally finding this place, we walked into a large, 'clean', restaurant, set up like a high school cafeteria. The tables are plastic portable tables. The wall decor is mostly posters tacked up on the walls with thumb tacks like a teenagers bedroom. Place was not busy at 6:30 on a Friday,. However, the girl at the register was impatient with us like there was an invisible line behind us that only she could see... it would have been nice if she would have asked if this was our first time, explain things to us and give us samples. The food combinations kinda make the place smell funny like the sewer was backing up...  I dunno, maybe i just have an overly sensative nose. My hubby didn't notice it at all....You are probably thinking, \"where is she going with this review?!? Well here I go to the most important part...the food!! The ordering system is a bit weird. I guess there are millions of options, but only a few are pictured on the wall behind the counter. When it arrives to your table, it's in a round disposable tinfoil container, perfect for take home transport! I had a rice bowl with red jade chicken and fried rice. Yum!! The fried rice was really good, a bit different from, let's say the Panda variety;) The red jade chicken had great flavor but was a little dried out like it was pre-made and sitting under a heat lamp for hours. My hubby got the combo plate with plain fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken and machaca. All of which he devoured like he'd never ate before! He said it was all fantastic! I tried some of his plate and I would have to agree! Best part of the meal, the giant snicker doodle cookies, made fresh! 
Nut shell, food was good! Not awesome, but good! We'll definitely be back! Might have to try the \"original location\" next time!!"}
{"text":"Honestly I have never experienced such a delightful time I love chino, everyone should come in Ruth Ann is the best waitress ever!"}
{"text":"My first time. The Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla was delish! All be it a little greasy. Good free snickerdoodle to to it off. I'll be back."}
{"text":"They serve a great execution of Chinese-Mexican fusion. It's pretty good. I love how they're eager to you give samples to try when you're trying to decide what to order. Plus that each order comes with a snickerdoodle.  I've unfortunately haven't tried it all, but I've particularly liked the Jade Red & emerald chicken."}
{"text":"It may sound like an unusual restaurant, but this hole in the wall is amazing! It's been a favorite of mine for years! I love their Jade Red Chicken, Emerald chicken and their black beans. Oh! And their snickerdoodles are to die for. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chino a couple times now and there are a couple things I love.  First, the Jade Chicken quesadilla is amazing... for some reason the flavors just work.  Second, this past time I had the pork fried rice, which was great and the snickerdoodle cookies... YUM! 

For what it's worth, this place is good.  If you want a nice fatty meal in a no fuss way, hit up chino bandido, you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo my Az friends this place is a must try !!! Heads up though ladies it's a bit of a dive but I promise it is the best tasting food ever ! Go early because lunch is always packed the rush starts at 12:00. Chino Bandido will not disappoint! As  always if you go let me know what you think . Enjoy friends"}
{"text":"Have to this is my boyfriends favorite place to go. He's been going there since he was 11. The he tells me I just don't take anyone here. It's pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Visited 7/31/13. 

I have been to the original in Phoenix and was much more impressed with the food. 

On this visit, we were there about 5:00 p.m. on a Wednesday night.  There were only a few other people present. 

The food was not very fresh.  It seemed like it may have been sitting in warmers for a while. The fried rice was dry.  The black beans not very fresh. The meat was dry. I also had a relleno.  It was more crust and cheese then chili.

I am still a fan. And will try this location again when it is busy. Maybe during lunch or weekend time to see if the food is fresher.

Three stars this time only because of the memory I have of the my first visit to the original in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have heard about this location many times in speaking with friends, but never had the chance to go. 

Happened to attend with buddies after finishing round of golf and Cave Creek.  Was surprised to find that is just up the street.  And now wish I had found this location before.

When we walked in the door, we were lined up but a person who let us taste the different meats.  Enjoyed the Jerk Fried Rice and Jade Chicken. Only had the bowl. Will order in a burrito next time. 

I would never stop in this place given location and that it is a hole in the wall.  But having heard about and now having experienced, this could be a regular stop after golf on weekends. 

Cannot wait to try the location in Chandler."}
{"text":"Went here today, March 19/12, and we totally enjoyed our meals.  This place is not fancy and, in fact is the anti-fancy, but we don't care so long as the food is good.

I had the Red Jade Chicken, which was crispy deep fried deliciousness, along with the Egg Foo Yung.  My sides were Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  Everything was really good and nothing was greasy.  I wasn't too sure about such a combo but I'll be ordering that same combo next time I go.  My hubby had the Quesadilla and I believe it had only cheese but then you'd get a little bite of ginger which popped that Quesadilla up to another level.  It was really good and, again, not oily.  He also had the Chinese Barbecued Pork, along with the Black Beans and Chicken Fried Rice and I asked him if he'd order the same again and he said, \"You bet!\" so he definitely enjoyed his meal as well.  To top it off, they delivered our meals to the table with cookies for dessert and I'm here to say that those cookies were very, very good.  Can't beat a free cookie either!  

Needless to say, we were both really full when we left."}
{"text":"I was pretty interested when I went here with my co-workers.  The concept was definitely cool and the food looked good in the pictures.  I ordered the Hengrenade Chicken w/ rice and got a drink.  

When I went to get the fountain drink, I pushed the ice dispenser in and a dead cockroach fell out into my cup.  I dumped the cup out and made sure it was a roach (and it was pretty big).  I told a lady at the front what happened and that the cockroach is still there.  She was like \"Oh sorry, they just sprayed\".  Great, so did they spray RAID on the ice or something?

My wife is a chef and I'm pretty sure when someone reports a violation you're supposed to do something about it, at least empty the god damn ice dispenser.  I wasn't really quiet about it either, other customers heard me say it and came up and asked me about it.  She gave me a new cup and I got ice from the other dispenser.  A few minutes later, I saw a cook come over and use a napkin to remove the dead roach from the fountain drink tray and put it into the garbage.

I got the food and it was ok.  The lady who brought us the food (not the lady I reported the problem too) was super nice and funny.  I think the roach thing ruined it for me though.  The food wasn't anywhere close to perfect, but it wasn't bad either.  The cookie was REALLY good though"}
{"text":"Several of my Phoenix friends recommended that I try this place.   They were right.     Very good and different.

     We ordered the Jen red pork, pollo Diablo, BBQ pork, jerk fried rice and pork fried rice.   All were very good but the pollo Diablo was extra delicious. Not as spicy as advertised (the girl said it was like a 7 on a 1-10 scale). I would call it more of a 5 but it was very tasty.  
       The different flavors of beans with fried rice and the spices on the meats made for an excellent combination.   They serve beer, as well, which was perfect with this grub.
       The only bad part were the cookies to finish.  Not a very good end to creative cuisine."}
{"text":"What a find!  Very unassuming atmosphere. Obviously a local favorite, and for good reason. Six of us ate WAY too much for under fifty bucks. Jerk chicken is beyond compare, and the machaca is among the best I've tasted. Don't expect to be blown away by the decor, but the food more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan"}
{"text":"OMG this place is soooo amazing!  I never thought a Chinese-Mexican fusion place would be so good.  I came here while out in Phoenix for Spring Training.  It was suggested by some friends that had come earlier in the month.  I love trying new places but was scared because I had my entire family with me.  Every single person just loved their food.  

I had a combo plate with Jerk chicken, Jade chicken and Jerk fried rice.  It came with choice of beans and I suggest you get the black beans!  Delicious!!!  And a added bonus a yummy cookie.  How much better can this meal get?

Just a little warning, if you don't like spicy food pass on the jerk style.  

This was our cheapest and best meal of the entire trip!  If we would have come here first we may have eaten here everyday!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't typically disagree with Mr. Fiere but this place is just okay.  It is different and it is a bit strange eating a quesadilla with fried chicken, for sure.  I was going to give this place three stars but the staff are really great and they welcome you here with a great experience.  If you like authentic Mexican food, don't come in here expecting it.  Definitely going to be a place you will love or just enjoy."}
{"text":"Months ago, When we arrived at our local and trusted Chandler location to find the doors locked and a permanently closed sign on the door, my family and I went into silent mourning. Yesterday, after indulging a craving and driving the 30+ miles to try the Phoenix location, we revisited that grief. Smaller portions, far lower quality, and 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong. How can you get an order wrong when you're literally filling out your own check? Not to mention, although the counter person was apologetic, the server was argumentative - and even continued to insist the orders were NOT wrong as he delivered our corrected meals. Coming from Mesa, this was a long hike for a meal we thought we could trust and were hugely let down. Please come back to the East side, Chino. I don't know how you're staying in business out there but we sure miss you out here."}
{"text":"Super Delicious altho we didn't do well figuring out the menu. Definitely great value for the quality and quantity. Nice easy ambiance and great staff."}
{"text":"Very quirky place but very good lunch. The kind of hole in the wall where you find business suits and tank tops. The food is quite unique and tasty. Very reasonable"}
{"text":"How have I never been here before? Looks can be deceiving with this strip mall dive-looking place that has a cafeteria feel.  When one of the staff noticed me staring at the menu, he offered me samples of the most popular dishes and I was grateful. I ended up ordering the jade chicken quesadilla style and the emerald chicken. The food was fresh and fantastic! The emerald chicken sauce had a great flavor that made me want to keep eating it and the quesadilla with the tangy, sweet and spicy jade chicken was mouth watering. The free volcano brownie topped with powdered sugar was a perfect ending! Everyone should try Chino Bandido!"}
{"text":"When I'm traveling I like to see if any restaurants near where I'm staying have been featured on any food shows. Its a good way to find unique and original places. Saw that this place had been on diners drive-ins and dives, so decided to check it out.

The first thing I liked about here was how open the place was, there's no shortage on space here. The menu takes a little figuring out, and the girl working the counter had about as much personality and cheer as a wet blanket so she wasn't really any help. We ordered a two different meat options and it came with fried rice and beans. 

We both got the jade chicken and pollo diablo, and fried rice and beans. The food was good, definitely better than I expected. The pollo diablo delivered on heat, and the jade chicken had good flavor both were crispy and not overly greasy.

Wouldn't have thought putting Mexican and Chinese together but Chino Bandidos makes it work. We will be coming back next time were in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We have eaten there for years and ALWAYS find the food amazing!!
We love that we can take new people and they can try different samples. We also love that we can customize every order."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1996. The prices have gone up, and portions have gone down. The staff gets worse every year, and the food quality has too. I almost feel bad that I'm talking badly about this place, it's such a landmark...but I have to be honest, it's just not as good, and the staff has a lot to do with it. The last two times I came here, they messed up my order, and when I told them \"that's not what i ordered\" they snipped \"that's how it comes\".
...wtf? No \"let's check your order\" nothing. And not to mention most of them act like they can't read...really, I think I'm done"}
{"text":"A novel place to try. Wanted to try their food since I found out about them being in south east Phoenix. Today was the day. Walked in just afternoon. Must have had perfect timing as the eating area was packed and no one in line to order. 

Went easy. Had the bbq pork with jerk fried rice. Got it to go. Was surprised when I opened the bag to find a snickerdoodle on top. Everything was good however I was heading north from Tucson so I won't visit often but if I'm in the area...

Service was cheerful and friendly. Prices can add up but I'd say reasonable anyway. Parking lot out front. Busy place. We'll run."}
{"text":"We both love Mexican food just as much as Chinese food, so this spot has been on our radar for a long time.  We drove 30+ minutes to get there, and we were heartbroken it did not live up to the expectation :(  We really wanted to love this local favorite.  For a first-timer, the ordering sheet was pretty confusing, and most of the people were helpful in exception of one guy who was annoyed we were taking so long trying to figure out the rice bowl combination.

I ordered the Emerald Chicken + Carnitas Rice Bowl with Jerk Fried Rice + Black Beansl.  The Emerald Chicken reminded me of a twist in Hainan Chicken: refreshingly light.  The Carnita was so dry, I had to put extra salsa to moisten the pork. Jerk Fried Chicken was sadly average with the highlight being the black beans with its sweet and creamy flavor blew my mind!  The food was served room temperature borderline cold with the exception of the black beans.  

My friend ordered the Emerald Chicken + Jerk Chicken with Plain Fried Rice + Black Beans.  We both agreed on the identical protein + side dish. The Jerk Chicken had no kick or \"Island flavor\"!

We hope our visit was just a anomaly.  Because of our love for both cuisines, we would give it another attemp but probably only if we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food from Chino Bandido and it is FIVE STARS all the way.  The rest of the joint is a dive, but the chow makes this a place to take your friends who want something different.  

The other challenge with Chino is the ordering process.  No matter how many times I go in there I can't help but think there must be a better way to place your order.  Having said that, the staff is VERY helpful no matter how many times you can't remember the routine.

RED JADE CHICKEN.  This would be my last meal if I was in the big house ready to meet my maker.  In fact, I'd just eat RED JADE CHICKEN until I passed out - then they could take me.  

Eat at Chinos and pass it along.  Your friends will thank you just like when you recommend a great movie no one knew about.

I read a few of the other reviews.  Some people are meant to eat at Taco Bell forever.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)"}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is in a strip mall near a discount brake shop and a super wide foot shoe store. Yes, the menu is confusing and placing your first order is the equivalent mental effort of high school calculus. Yes, it feels like an elementary school cafeteria with what looks like the remnants of a putting green in the corner. Yes, after you've eaten, you feel like you're well on your way to giving birth.

BUT ...

It's got a panda wearing a sombrero! How can you go wrong? The food is an epiphany in your mouth. The black beans alone are enough to keep me going back. In fact, I live in California now, but wouldn't dream of visiting AZ without going there. Plus, they give you a fresh baked cookie!

The perfect plate: Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken in a quesadilla, Black Beans, Chicken Fried Rice.

The perfect plate lyte: Jade Red, Black Beans and Plain Rice in a bowl."}
{"text":"Chino rocks. Seriously, for a place that looks as hole-in-the-wall as possible, this is the greatest mix of Asian, Mexican, and Jamaican foods imaginable!

I'm being a bit facetious, but, seriously, there are items here that are just incredible. The Jade Red Chicken and Jen Red Pork are delicious, especially in a quesadilla. The same goes for the Jerk Pork. Their black beans are the best I've tasted, anywhere, and every one of the fried rices is delicious.

To top it all off...you get a big-ass snickerdoodle cookie at the end.

Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place a lot, and after finally trying it, I think that it's a bit over-hyped. Not saying that it's not good, but it's not a restaurant I would go to again and again. 

It's definitely a unique restaurant, and the food is pretty tasty, but it's a bit too greasy for my tastebuds. I ordered the Jen Red Chicken in a quesadilla, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice, and Black Beans. I really enjoyed the Jen Red Chicken with the quesadilla. It was something I have never tried before, but I really liked the way the two cuisines meshed together. The Emerald Chicken was okay, but not exactly what I thought it would be like. The black beans are delicious! I don't know what they put in them, but it's so good, especially when paired with the Jerk Fried Rice. I think the Jerk Fried Rice on it's own is mediocre, but with the beans it's amazing. Of course, we can't forget that every meal comes with a free snickerdoodle. The cookie is perfect and comes fresh out of the oven. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. For the portions of the food and the price($8), this meal was pretty worth it."}
{"text":"This place was on my to do list during my visit to Arizona recently. I had seen the restaurant on Diners, Dive-ins, and Drives and knew I had to try it. Its a blend of Mexican/Asian food. I had the jade red chicken with white rice, AWESOME. You also get a cookie with your order :) Very unique place to have a meal. I highly recommend it if you're ever in the Glendale/Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I always heard good things about this place, never been so we wanted to try it. Kinda looka like a dirty ghetto place from the outside and when entering the spot, very musky and looks weird because they have the sitting area on the right and ordering on the left. The lady in the front was sweet and asked us if it was our first time, showed us the menu, let us try the different chickens and told me whats good and whats not. We got the jared red chciken (I think thats what its called) with chicken fried rice.... it was delicious  Overall really good food and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So good! I think you pretty much win with whatever you get at Chino. I love the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken...the list goes on and on! The black refried beans are great too. I'm sort of a white rice fan, but I've heard the fried rice varieties are all yummy. I love that every meal comes with a snickerdoodle cookie. They are so good! The best part about Chino's is the mixture of flavors you get and the fact that they offer samples. Their ordering system can be a little complicated, but the staff is very helpful!"}
{"text":"This place it's definitely worth taking the time to review hence the reason they have 775 reviews. I would recommend having the Jade Red if you come here. A very casual style whole in the wall restaurant but if you want something quick and tasty, stop by."}
{"text":"I try to make it over to Chino Bandido for lunch at least once a month. Everything they have is good (although, admittedly, I haven't actually tried everything they have). I usually get a combination of Hengrenade Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Pollo Diablo, or Emerald Chicken with Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice (and don't forget the snickerdoodle). This is one of those restaurants that I wish was on every corner in every town in the world, so I could always get my Chino Bandido fix no matter where I am."}
{"text":"This is a must try dining experience for any Phoenician or any adventurous visitor!

It's unique and amazingly good!"}
{"text":"After many times of going here (and then later regretting it due to the surge of burping that goes on and on for the rest of the day), I still don't get it...

I don't get their special ordering process..
I don't get the whole Mexican/Asian food mixture 'coolness'..
I don't get that nasty cookie that leaves a layer of lard on the roof of my mouth..

I just don't get what others see in it...

Their dishes are decent but there's always something too strong in any one of them that makes them hell for my body to digest (hence the never ending burps).... their black beans are too sweet.. Jade Chicken is too spicy.. Machaca is too salty or overly seasoned... Let's just say I've tried many combinations (yes only because my coworkers seem to find this place highly enjoyable and I go along for the team-spirit.. pfffff... yah) to find something that doesn't have such an effect on me and I'm still not sold.  I do have to say their staff has always been nice and friendly... sadly, that doesn't trump taste in this case.

Their ordering process is a huge PITA - I usually just tell the girl the 2 or 3 things I want and don't even bother 'learning' their whole 'ordering process' -{cough}stupid{cough}.  Also the layout there is oddddd.... lots of empty space and foldable plastic Rubbermaid tables and chairs makes it seem very 'thrown together'.

Sorry, but I'm just not a fan."}
{"text":"Seriously, could eat this any day at any time of day. So bomb! Never disappointed with the food or the service. Fast and delicious, can't be that!"}
{"text":"aye, aye, aye, chino bandito....mexinese or chinexican what ever you call it, tis muey hao.

location tells you that you might get an intestinal parasite but you are probably going to need to lose a few pounds if you eat here often so..meh

the jade red chicken is probably the best thing on the menu next to the jerk chicken, the black beans are pretty divine as well. fried rice is a little dry but you will eat it anyway, because you don't want to anger pancho the panda...(mustache rydes!)

oh! free cookies...because you didn't consume enough terrible for you food. you just love consuming don't you? and feeling bad about it after? mmmhmmm...mommy knows

i took off one star because for sweet baby jesus's sake! could you please take down the picture of ghey ferrari? that guy is such a nozzle."}
{"text":"Not sure how you can't love this place...Mexican and Chinese fares...yes please! It's been a local favorite for years. Been featured on a few cable tv shows. You can try a sample of just about anything. Lunch time can be pretty crowded but you'll always find a place to sit."}
{"text":"A few of my family members really like this place.

I'm not really too keen about getting food there again.

The food there is heavy.. and when I say heavy, I mean HEAVY.  I'm pretty sure it's that way because it's so damn oily.

Don't expect to be productive after you eat there.  My wife brought me lunch from there and afterwards, I felt like I ate an anvil.  That food sat in my belly like a couch potato.

It's kind of like Filiberto's.. you take a couple of bites, and then something in your mind clicks and suddenly, you feel the urge to locate the nearest bathroom."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Red Jade Chicken! I will bring friends and family here!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaurant. When we walked in, they offered us a sample of anything on their menu to try before ordering. We ended up ordering the red jade chicken & fried rice, and a combo with the shredded pork & the jerk chicken burrito with beans & rice. The beans were really salty but the red jade chicken & fried rice were good. The location itself is hidden in a parking lot & is pretty hard to find. The food wasn't the greatest but not bad either ... Just okay."}
{"text":"Packed with flavor!!! One of my favorites- eat there at least monthly. Not the cleanest looking dining room, just in case you care. I always order take out and I'm never disappointed. The jerk (chicken) fried rice is phenomenal with just the right amount of spice so even my kids will eat a little. My favorite entree is the pollo diablo because it's deep fried and smothered in garlic, onion and chilis. But if you're not a spicy fan and want something healthier I recommend the jade chicken which has a nice light ginger onion sauce with grilled chicken. My kids love the veggie quesadillas but they do have spicy peppers so beware is your kids don't like spice. We love you Chino Bandito!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Such an amazingly diverse menu. Everything I've had is fantastic. And a great value, too! This time I tried the Jerk Chicken in a quesadilla and Jade Chicken with Jerk fried rice and refried beans. Awesome. Can't wait to try something else next time I'm in Moon Valley."}
{"text":"One our favorites and I can't believe I forgot to review this place for this long. We eat at Chino Bandido every time we're in the area and my entire family loves it.

I always get the Jade Chicken and switch up the other item along with jerk fried rice and refried beans. Always fresh and delicious. Only complaint is the menu is a bit confusing the first couple of times you fill it out but once you have it down it makes sense.

Highly recommended, try it and you'll love it.

Hint: if it is your first time they have a sample station and just ask to try the items before you order."}
{"text":"I tried their version of jerk chicken. It was ok, but not for me to go there again. When I walked in there was probably 2 customers who were already seated and eating their food. They took about 20min to get my order ready and it was a small bowl with white rice and chicken."}
{"text":"The location is a nice hole in the wall joint.  There are plenty of seats so no worries about sitting down.  Ordering is a bit confusing the first time, but the people behind the counter are very friendly and willing to help.  They made it a breeze.

I had the red jade chicken, jerk chicken, refried black beans and jerk fried rice.  At first it doesn't look like a lot of food, but it is deceptively filling.  The food is itself was excellent and I found myself mixing the entire bowl together which gave a great blend of flavors.  I am going to visit this place again whenever I am in the area.  Bonus points for the amazing cookie that comes complimentary with the food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the Phoenix area and I've got to say, this was a great meal. The food was really good fusion food. I got the combo with Jen red pork and a jade red chicken quesadilla, jerked rice and black beans. 

Jerk rice was really flavorful and was a good sized portion. 

Black beans were okay, nothing special about them, but they were still tasty.

Jen red pork was juicy, crispy, and sweet. 

Jade red chicken quesadilla was really good. The quesadilla was crispy and cheesy and the chicken inside was juicy and flavorful.

The snickerdoodle cookie was a nice touch and was much appreciated. Really good cookie, chewy and soft, just how I like them.

Definitely will be coming back to this place to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Was in the Phoenix area this past weekend with the family for my wife's reunion with old high school friends and classmates.  Chino Bandito was the last stop before heading back to California and it was worth it.  My family and I are fans of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and have been to 7 places from that show and none have been disappointments. In fact, Chino Bandito is probably the best Triple D restaurant we have eaten at with HRD Coffee Shop in San Francisco second.

We arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before opening but they let us in anyway instead of waiting outside.  We told them this was our first time eating there and they gave us samples of their most popular dishes.  Each dish tasted very good individually, but the secret of this place is when you eat them together.  I couldn't believe how Jamaican, Mexican, and Chinese flavors could match so well.  Re-fried black beans with jerk chicken fried rice, combined with emerald chicken and BBQ pork?  A very unusual combo but it actually works...and works almost to perfection.  My wife and my mother loved the food as much as I did.  Finally, to cleanse your pallet, Chino Bandito also gave us complementary homemade Snicker doodle cookies, which were also fantastic.

This place is like a perfect storm of flavors.  You can taste each individual dish and then find new flavors when blended together.  I could go back again and again and still think I am going there for the first time.  Chino Bandito is that good.  The only criticism I can think of is that it may be a little expensive, which I always complain about, but in this case it is well worth the price.

If you are in the area, Chino Bandito must be on your to-do list.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a little hesitant to try a Mexican-Chinese fusion at first, but any reason to pause vanished when I tasted the delicious jade chicken quesadilla. Chino Bandido's surprisingly delightful flavor combinations will have me back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Chinese and Mexican on one plate?  WHAT?

Seriously...it's the best thing that's happened in the state of Arizona since 1924 when they put a stop to the ban on interracial marriage (See what I did there??).

Ordering is difficult.  It's a bit more complicated than most places.  But once you get the hang of it, it's totally worth it.  If you've never been before, just let them know and they'll walk you through it (with samples!).

Totally affordable and filling...with a free snickerdoodle!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat in the valley!!!! You have to have the jade chicken and pork fried rice!!!!!! MUST have!!! You can sample all of their food before ordering which is amazing!!!!!!! They atmosphere is not amazing..... Whole in the wall in a strip mall but the food can't be beat!!! Promise!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot."}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly staff.   Love the Jerk Fried Rice in the combo meal plus Jerk Chicken burrito.

Ask for a sample of almost all of the items.   You may be surprised at what you like."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chino Bandido Takee-Outee, vaguely racist name and all, since high school. It's nice to know that some things never change. The Mexican-Carribbean-Chinese menu never changes, and neither does the flavor.

If you're a newcomer let them know, they have samples. Get in line, fill out a form with what you want to eat, pay at the counter, and take a seat. My standard order is a jerk chicken/hengrenade chicken combo with jerk fried rice and black beans. Any of their entrees are available as burritos or quesadillas. Sadly, I can no longer get these because of the damned gluten thing, but you should try it. Their tortillas are fantastic.

A combo with two entrees, beans, rice, a drink and one of their famous snickerdoodle cookies costs around $8. It really doesn't get better than this for that price. I had to knock them down a star because they don't have enough restrooms for the size of the space and because the last couple times I was there the food had cooled somewhat before it made it out to our table, but it's really good, even cooled down."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal! My boyfriend and I were test driving a new car and happened to pass by this little gem. I had heard about it and I've been wanting to check it out for a few years, it's just not in my neck of the woods (East Mesa).  
After taking care of business at the dealership we stoped and grabbed a meal to share to go since we had to make it back to our side of town in a timely manner. I ordered a 2 item combo. The second item can either come in a burrito or a quesadilla.  We chose the jade red chicken, which was delicious. It's like orange chicken style but better and with a little kick. My second item was the jerk chicken in a quesadilla... delicious as well. For our sides we got the white rice which I always get when I get Chinese, and the second side was refried beans which were really good too! The guy that took our order was awesome...  we told him it was our first time so he told us what the favorites were and gave us a coupe of sample bites before we made our decision. All in all the place was great. Will definitely go back there if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Saw this on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives several years ago and now that I spend winters in Phoenix, we finally decided to try it. So many people criticize the decor & cleanliness, but if you've ever been in a typical Chinese \"restaurant\" in New Jersey, Chino Bandido is pure heaven. And unlike typical East Coast Chinese \"restaurants\" you can have a beer or glass of wine with your meal. The Jade chicken is crispy with a nice bit of heat. The Emerald chicken is moist and the ginger is fresh. Prices are good compared with our favorite Chinese eatery in NYC Chinatown (Joe's Shanghai). We will eat at Chino Bandido again the next time we've got a hankering for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Finally experience Chino Bandido and glad I did. They let you try some of the popular items which helps to determine what you might get. The food is full of flavor and not so hard on the wallet. A two meat combo with rice and bean, drink, and cookie will run about $10. They also have wine and beer."}
{"text":"3rd time going, 3rd time disappointed. great snicker doodle cookies."}
{"text":"Compared to the  now defunct Chandler location, this Phoenix location is a bit of a dive but has a good vibe! This location is very busy though especially for mid afternoon!  Friendly staff and better food than the former Chandler location that was going downhill the last 18 months."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. The staff was very helpful with ordering and allowed us to sample six of their most popular items. We had enough food for leftovers the next day for under $25. It was great to see everything from ties to tatoos having a good time. My only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"The reviews are all right-on.  The jade red chicken and carnitas with chinese fried rice and with black beans were really good.  And the savory snickerdoodle with every order is a sweet touch!

For first timers they walk you through the ordering process which can be a bit tricky with all of the particulars of filling out the sheet (sushi bar style, but with special letters and charts).  

One less star for the dank and gross dining area (cool panda vaquero mural, btw), but other than that this place is solid.  Sorry, don't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings. 

And for those curling their lips at the thought of combining the two cuisines, look at any Chinese restaurant in the area - it's most likely a Mexican cooking Chinese food anyways...."}
{"text":"Love the food! The prices are decent and the portions are filling. The inside is pretty spacious and the vibe is just right! My favorite is anything quesadilla style!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible...the worst of both worlds.  In fact I'm looking at my package of peanut butter crackers and thinking that would have been more satisfying.  

Had the chili relleno, the chili inside was not even prepared properly because it was hard and stringy, then they stuffed it with processed american cheese and coated it with a flavorless breading.

I also had the chinese pork...blah.  Chicken fried rice...blak and cold.  refired beans and cheese...cold.

If you like cheap bad food go here!"}
{"text":"Really Really good stuff here! If you like spicy then this place has you covered. Try the Pollo Diablo with the jerk chicken rice. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken!!! I had the combination jerk chicken in quesadilla and jade red chicken with chicken fri rice and black beans ~~~ delirious !!"}
{"text":"I was worried when I saw the giant signed poster of Guy Fieri but comforted by the giant life size statue of a Panda as bodhissatva pistolero.

The food here is just awesome. Its a Chinese/ Mexican fusion place. You can get a combo with either refried pinto or black beans and several kinds of rice and Asian and Caribbean chicken flavors plus a snickerdoodle. If you get the combo you can get your food in a quesadilla or burro. On the weekends they have special cookies and black bean tostadas.

I love the food here. Mexican in Phoenix sucks but they got it down, tasty and spicy - plus I LOVE the panda motif. Good food and a good gimmick. Sold!"}
{"text":"So I've been going to this Chino Bandido place off and
on for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican
(Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location
by the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the
whole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just
trying all the different possible fillings. So in this
Chandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It
is more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order
sheet. 
   The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks.
It ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't
even look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat
first and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out 
how to express that. 
  It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile
Relleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade
Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald
Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca.
Got all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl, 
combination, Quesadilla, or Burrito. 
   For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or
optional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.
   For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20 
but I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for 
refried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want. 
JFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork 
fried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the 
full-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or 
a quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or
quesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans. 
   You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one
item together if you're daring. Same with the burritos. 
   You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you 
didn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get
it as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.
   Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't
enough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.
   Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need
an endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is 
an occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately
I've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole
rice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank
you. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need 
higher education to fill out the order form you might still need a 
sextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google
map makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast 
into the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the
place during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"WARNING:  Do not go here after 8pm!!!

I usually eat dinner around 8pm and have usually come to Chino Bandido around 830 or so.

Last week I got there around 815pm, saw a man sampling items and I wanted to try a couple.  I waited behind him at the sampling line and was repeatedly asked by the cashier if I was ready to order, I said no.  Minutes later manager Mona at the sample line told cash register \"I dont know what she is waiting for?\"  DUH Im behind the guy getting samples so I told her Id like a sample, she gave me a sample of the Jerk Chicken (spicy dry gross).  

I wanted to also try the machaca and carnitas but seconds after she hands me my first sample, (the man before me was offered almost everything) she asked me if I was ready to order!  She then told me \"you know, we close at 9pm\" while my watch said 820pm.  

It wouldnt bother me as much if this was the first time I had been there, but there are other factors:

.AGAIN it was 820pm and there was absolutely no sign anywhere saying the kitchen closed at 830pm.

.this was the 3rd time I had been there, after 8pm, and have been rushed and treated like crap.  Sorry I take a whole 5 minutes to decide what Id like to order.

FOOD (I have only tried 3 of their dishes because again I arrive 40 minutes before they close so samples are not an option)

Chinese BBQ Pork 
.Tasty some pieces are dry but the moist fatty pieces you  find are delicious.

Jade Red Chicken
.Slightly spicy version tastes like mix of orange and sweet sour chicken from Panda Express.

Quesadilla
.very cheesy and deliciously crispy.

OH and ordering is the most uncomplicated-made-complicated thing here.

2 stars since ordering and customer service is SOO ridiculously poor.  For me, while their food is good it is SO not worth going here during my dinner time because of their lack of customer service for their repeat customers. =("}
{"text":"One of the reasons we came to Arizona this weekend was because of Chino Bandito.  The restaurant lived up to the hype.  A blend of Chinese and Mexican food in a tasty fashion.  Tonight we ate the Carnitas Fried Rice, the Green Emerald Chicken Burrito, Teriyaki Chicken Burrito, and Red Jade Chicken Quesadilla.  I highly recommend adding black beans to your burrito.  It works even greater.  Next time we visit, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great novelty restaurant, as seen on TV!

The machaca and jerk chicken were pretty good, but the jerk fried rice had some very hard crunchy bits inside, maybe old fried rice nuggets?

The place is pretty big and very quiet on a weeknight. Very kid friendly. In fact, kids get free rice and gravy plus free drinks. A cheapskate delight!

The great wall of chino was unforgettable, and the staff very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"How can anyone not be a fan of a place with a Mexican Panda as their mascot? I was surprised at how big and popular this place is when I got there. The restaurant itself is very cheesy, just like their website, but I think it's all on purpose. It's hilarious! 

As far as their food...it was decent. I wasn't expecting much. It's not very chinese nor mexican. I will come back though, and try other dishes. I agree with the last poster, this is definitely a place to take first-timers."}
{"text":"A Phoenix classic, ask the staff for help ordering if it's your first time.  Amazing black beans and jade red chicken.  Gets very busy around lunch time."}
{"text":"Filthy!  There is no reason a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant needs to be dirty... The floors, the tables, the walls, the stained ceiling!   I DON'T want to see the kitchen!  We ate the food but I might regret it!"}
{"text":"This is for sure a hole in the wall kind of place.  However, places like this have the best food!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Red Jade Chicken! I highly recommend this place. 

This place could use some new tables and a fresh coat of paint but the food is amazingly delicious!!! Make sure you try the cookies..MMM!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Chino Bandito! My favorite guilty pleasure.

I'll keep it short and sweet - I get the combo plate with 2 Jade Red Chicken quesadillas, refried beans, and pork fried rice. I have tried a few of the other menu items but this is hands down, my favorite. Finish it off with a snickerdoodle. This is one of the only meals that I will eat the leftovers of, and it's equally amazing when it's cold. 

On the weekend they have tostadas - delicious! They also have a second cookie flavor. Sometimes it's peanut butter, sometimes chocolate. The snickerdoodle is the best out of all of them though.

It's intimidating when you step in as a first timer but don't worry, just walk up to counter and ask how it works. They will let you sample anything before you order and walk you through the ordering process on the paper. You will be a pro on your second visit."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. When I was younger, it was one of my favorites. Unfortunately, being kind of a health nut, I not longer eat meat. They don't have much to offer for vegetarians, although they do have something to try which is always nice. My boyfriend loves this place but his diet is different than mine. 

As for atmosphere, while it may be crowded, it is always by good people. I have never encountered bad service here. It's so great to eat here. It isn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. If you are nearby, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"They have the nicest people working here!! Eve, you were so sweet and friendly. Thank you for making us feel the Hafa Adai spirit here in PHX! As our table guest Trent put it, \"food combo is bizarre, but super good!\" Best \"bizarre\" I've ever encountered. 

They have a system here, and I think you'll LOVE it! Eve told us that kids will be kids and they understand. She said they still get their free cookie and drink even if they're little McDonalds monsters and don't know what they're missing out on yet. 

We will be back Chinos! 
Love, 
Micros"}
{"text":"I am the Chino Bandido and I'm here to say.......

Good friends took me here for the first time. They are a Phoenix institution if you grew up in the area. I can understand how they aren't for everyone, but they are for me. I'm there at least a few times a year.

The menu is something you have to get used to. Best idea is grab it an go right to the counter. No written word can aptly explain how to navigate the order sheet. The employees however can get you in the right direction quickly.

LOVE THE COOKIES! Snickerdoodle for sure is the best IMHO.

Long story short....something different than you have ever had, or will ever have again.....unless you go back. :)"}
{"text":"It was good, inexpensive and SUPER filling, lots of food for the price, plus you get to sample before you pick your meal so you know what you are in store for!"}
{"text":"We come here often something different then the same old food expanded my belt lol good fast food"}
{"text":"I like a diverse flavor profile that includes spicey and savory mixes. The Diablo chicken is superb in a quesada. My daughter loves the Red jade chicken. My go to for take out"}
{"text":"The best food ever! And the customer service was amazing! Keep up the good work kids!!!"}
{"text":"CHINO BANDIDO VIRGINS READ THIS!

--Make sure that if it's your first time in the restaurant, you need to tell them so.  They will give you a free sampling of their various ingredients to help you decide on what you want to order.

They have various asian and mexican inspired meats and rices, which you can order in various ways (i.e., in a burrito, quesadilla, a la carte).  Their jade chicken and black beans are really good.  The other items that I ordered were just OK.  The food is pretty greasy and unhealthy, but it will fill you up and leave you satisfied for sure.  You even get a free cookie with your meal which is a nice touch.

The building itself is located in a tiny strip mall which isn't very inviting, and the inside is a little dirty, but don't let that scare you away.  The place is so unique that it is still worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"At the behest of a few friends and some glowing Yelp reviews, I decided to venture to Chino. 

The one on Dobson and Chandler is practically invisible unless you know where to look, but once I found it I thought it was kinda cool that it was hidden away like some manner of Indiana Jones treasure (there's a timely reference for you).

The people inside are BEYOND friendly.  Like, super friendly.  Like, if they weren't serving my food and helping me understand the complexities of their menu, they might have freaked me out, sorta like It the Clown or that one episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark or Michael Jackson's nose (or lack thereof).   They really do give you a crash course on how to order, and give you samples of everything.

I got the machaca beef and the emerald chicken, with jerk rice and refried beans.  Dear lord.  Talk about scrumtrilescent.  The machaca was so flavorful and delicious, and the emerald chicken was just the most amazing thing I've ever put in a tortilla (beside the one time me and this girl were messing around using food, and I...nevermind).

The only thing that could possibly make this place any better is a bigger selection of drinks.  Some Mexican drinks (Horchata, maybe) fresh made or some juices and teas might make it complete.  So good.  So so good."}
{"text":"Awful! The dining area is filthy and the food is over-fried and tasteless."}
{"text":"This mexican/chinese fusion restaurant is awesome. It is delicious and quick. The restaurant is kind of dirty and the tables and chairs are old. The food and service over powers the fact the place is dirty. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"We went as a family and each of us purchased a different combo. It looked like and interesting concept but we did not finish the meals. The chicken had a boiled texture that was rubbery. The pork was tender and had a good flavor but overall we did not enjoy the meals. The mixture of latin and asian was not something that mixed well with us. The service was good and they were friendly. We will keep ordering asian food by itself and latin food by itself to enjoy the flavors each style of food brings to the table."}
{"text":"How does that song go again?  Oh, yeah...\"Ya gotta have a gimmick, if you wanna have a chance!\"

The ordering process here a bit convoluted and the food so-so, but for some reason people go 'koo-koo for coco puffs' about this place.  Yes people, that's a panda wearing a sombrero, get over it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is so very yummy and the staff is GREAT. They are very friendly and helpful if you have questions or need help on how to order"}
{"text":"First time visit..glad we came! Was watching Diners Drive in's and Dives.....so I decided to check the local area to see if they've been anywhere in AZ. Since this was on the list we decided to give it a try. I have the combo meal with the jerk fried rice, black beans, emerald chicken and jade red chicken. It was all very delicious. Do note if you do not like spice the black beans may not be for you because they are a bit on the spicy side, but I thought they were phenomenal! 

I will definitely be back again soon. The emerald chicken was great to try and seems very healthy. I think next time I will try a different item in its place and keep everything else the same...other than I will try the refried beans to see what they bring to the table! The snickerdoodle cookie was a nice treat at the end! 

All in all a great meal for the price you pay. Also, when you walk in you will be filing out a paper slip for your order and hand it to them....we did not know that so we just walked right up to the front...they were very understanding though and did it for us...but just a heads up :)"}
{"text":"Ordering at this place is a bit stressful.  You get an order sheet and pencil.  No matter how I complete our order,  it seems I always f it up. I love the jade red chicken, refried black beans and jerk fried rice.  The entire place is dingy and dirty.  A brightly lit dive if you will.. Tables are sticky to touch but still always full of customers. Even with these issues I return a few times a each year.  If I were ever to move away, I feel that I would miss the Mexican Chinese fusion cuisine of the place."}
{"text":"The food is excellent in taste don't get me wrong... But let me tell you a little story about the incredible gastrointestinal pain you will go through after eating this. I hadn't eaten anything past its prime/ undercooked/ questionable for a long time before I've eaten there... I know because I had to trace my steps back with my doctors. I had eaten here and the next day I had the absolute WORST food poisoning I've ever gotten in my life hands down. I actually had to go to the hospital because I was in such pain and I had vomited all my fluids up. The doctors confirmed I'd eaten something pretty nasty. Friggin delicious food but definitely not if it means I'm going to be crouched over both a toilet and trash can for days."}
{"text":"My mom has been taking me here since I was 10 years old and after she passed it is still my every other Friday go to like her and I used too. The food is some of the best food I've ever had I'm always spreading the word about this great combined cuisine. It is Mexican food and Chinese food mixed together how can you say no?! I personally get a red jade chicken quesadilla with black beans and plain fried rice the two entree plate also comes with a fresh baked snickerdoodle and it's the best cookie I've ever had always a childhood favorite of my mom coming home with a chinos cookie! The jerk chicken and machacca is also absolutely amazing my son loves the teriyaki chicken and white rice. They can put any meat into a quesadilla or a burrito! Also their cheese stuffed pepper that's deepfriend is also quite amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Winner, winner chicken dinner! I saw this place featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I decided to give it a shot. A huge plus is that they let you sample their food. So you basically get to taste the whole menu before you even order, which was fantastic! They make you feel like a valued customer. And they'll help you order and explain everything if you're a newbie.

My favorites were the jade red chicken and the jerk chicken. I could eat the jade red chicken all day, yeah it's that good! It has the right amount of sweet and sour without just being drenched in some indescribable sauce. The jerk chicken was good but it was too peppery like I was forewarned. When I ate it later it was perfect. 

It is a dive so don't expect anything fancy but they have great food to make up for it. Don't miss out your taste buds are waiting!"}
{"text":"This place is unparalleled. The selection is huge and you can mix and match so many things to make the perfect meal for you. Definitely try the jade chicken! Chino's is our go to spot, always."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!! I have eaten at this hole-in-the-wall more times then I would like to admit (I work near by) and I have tried everything on the menu and would definitely say it is all excellent. The combos/fusions are crazy but, somehow they work!

Try it - you will like it! 

My only negative is that depending on the cook, sometimes the portions run small and for example the pollo diablo - sometimes its perfectly hot & spicey other times it is sooo freakin hot you'll cry twice - In & Out!!! Mind you, that is one of my favorite dishes - however, lately it just seems to vary day by day...."}
{"text":"Is it Chinese? Mexican? I don't know but why am I eating beans with chopsticks?

This place is great! worth the experience, slightly complicated ordering system for the first timer, but they are there to help you through the process.

Food is cooked fantastically, flavors are great!

Stop in you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat the appearance of the establishment doesn't do the food justice. Get the jade red chicken. It's off the chain mayne"}
{"text":"This isn't fine dining by any stretch, but if you're looking for a really satisfying inexpensive meal, you can't go wrong with Chino Bandido. The menu can seem a bit daunting for first timers, let the cashier know if you haven't been there before. The people are always friendly and they'll give you lots of samples. 

My favorite menu items are the Jerk Fried Rice and the Jade Red Chicken."}
{"text":"Emerald Chicken - Genius, delicious.... wash it down with a snickerdoodle cookie. What more in this world could you ask for. 

This restaurant made me question what other types of food could you combine and turn into pure genius?

{"text":"Tried the jerk chicken and the jade red chicken - great mex and Chino combo - great food - fast and easy on the wallet - great people"}
{"text":"Salt and pepper go a long,long way. When jerk fried rice is bland you have a seasoning issue. Egg foo young beautifully prepared but absolutely bland. Even my 85 year old mother had to douse it with a few packs of soy sauce. The jade red chicken was ok but again nothing special. The retried beans were excellent. Maybe I should have stuck to the Mexican side of the menu. Disappointed as this was the first \"triple d\" featured restaurant I've eaten at. Oh well press on.."}
{"text":"I am dreaming of the Red Jade Chicken and the snicker doodle was heaven on earth. Truly one of the more eclectic dining experiences I've ever had, and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"see this picture posted by another yelper: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=nEEtzmZrXXFr-egtbVSF6A
That's the size portion I'm used to from Chino Bandido.  What we got last week was about 3/4 of that.  


My husband and I have been ordering the combo of jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and black beans ever since this location opened in Chandler. And have always been satisfied.   

I was so shocked at the portion that I asked the employees what happened.  Their explanation is that they \"have not downsized the portions, because the portions were being over-sized incorrectly before.   So, now the portions are the right size.\"  And looking through the other yelper photos, i see one from '08 that looks similar to (but still more than) the portions size we got last weekend.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=kGQgU8IelC8DABJQSdIYoQ  So, oK, well, I can understand what the employee was talking about, but, it still is rather disappointing.   Considering that we've ordered the combo more times than I can count, and have never had the \"mini/correct\" portion-size ever before until last weekend. 

They also used to give my daughter a small cup of rice with a little bit of plain chicken.  this time, when I asked for a little kiddie cup, they gave me the same size cup, but it was empty...

The one thing they give generously still are those big huge sugar cookies.  Unfortunately, we can only ever finish half of those.  I'd rather get a free cup of rice for my daughter, than three big sugar cookies.  If ever we go back, i'll ask if they'll do that for me.  But, we're not likely to come back again even though we like the food, it's just not affordable for our family anymore.  One combo wouldn't even satisfy me as it is now.  For my husband and I, I'd say if we ordered three combo meals, that would be filling."}
{"text":"Sign of decline

Ok has been one of my favorite places to eat 

Due a work location shift had not been there for about six months.

So I go to get my favorite since I had been craving it. The lady at the counter is abrupt informs me that she will fill out the sheet.

 So I place my order and wait. And wait. Place is not busy. And wait.

Get the food, have to ask again for my drinks. Abrupt again.

I got it to go. Open it and find my Jen red pork quesadilla has a grand total of 5 pieces of pork. Yes  small pieces totaling 5. One section no meat just sauce. Burrito half full as normal. Ordered double jerk rice instead of beans got one portion of rice. Rice had balls of cold white rice with no flavoring.


Severely disappointed. My brother goes this last week. Almost same exact experience.

Sad to me to see the decline of such a great quirky place"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on the advice of some friends and were really disappointed.  I like Chinese food and I like Mexican food  - but the 2 together, I've decided - not so much.  

I gave them a star for the fact they will give you samples of the meat before ordering which was nice and another star for the phenomenal snickerdoodle cookie. 

Unfortunately, it just wasn't our style of food - but I respect that everyone has different tastes and opinions on food - so for all of you Chino Bandido lovers out there - you can have our share!  ;)"}
{"text":"This time I decided to go to Chino and eat light.  \"Impossible!!!\" you say and normally I would agree.  

However, there is an off menu choice to substitute salad for rice and/or beans.  (For the regulars; just write salad over the rice and bean options).  It was awesome, I was not stuffed and hating myself at the end of lunch.  

After lunch feeling light as a feather I ate the snicker doodle... D'oh!"}
{"text":"As you may have noticed in my profile, I live in Utah.  The night before I was to take a short business trip to Phoenix a few years ago, I happened to catch a then-new episode of _Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives_ on the television.  In it, Guy featured Chino Bandido.  Right away, I knew I would have to find a way to get there on my trip.  As luck would have it, my hotel was located in Mesa--just north of Chandler.  After bribing a hotel employee to break company rules and drive me outside their ridiculously small \"approved\" shuttle van travel range, I made it to the restaurant.

I know what everybody says: \"Chinese Mexican mixed together?  With a little Jamaican added in?  That can't work.\"  But it does work, quite nicely in fact.  The owners were present and they were just as friendly and helpful as had been portrayed on TV.  When I said it was my first visit, they instantly began offering samples of various menu items to help me make my selection.  They really helped make it a great experience.

These were food types I never would have dreamed of combining.  When my meal was finished, I wondered why I hadn't thought of it before.  It seemed like such a natural combination and I absolutely loved it.  I was so happy, I even bought some t-shirts for myself and my wife (who was jealous that she couldn't be here with me).

This was great food at a reasonable price in a nice location with plenty of parking.  Whenever I hear of a friend going to Phoenix, I always recommend they stop at Chino Bandido."}
{"text":"I had been to the Chino Bandido location in Chandler and loved it (I've written a seperate Yelp review about that experience).  I was anxious to return, but living in Utah makes that virtually impossible... unless I got creative.  So when my little brother in Los Angeles announced he was getting married, I knew I had to act.  While driving down to LA for the wedding, my wife and I detoured to Phoenix so we could have dinner at Chino Bandido.  That's right: we drove hours out of our way, spending an extra day on the road (and an extra night in a hotel) JUST so we could eat here.  Can you tell I'm a fan?

This time around I decided to come to the Phoenix location rather than return to Chandler.  The menu was identical and thus the food experience was just as yummy as I remembered.  This location is in an old strip mall and is a bit of a dive compared to Chandler.  Don't think of it as dirty or unclean; just call it grungy.

My wife had been jealous ever since I made it to Chino Bandido Chandler because she wasn't able to accompany me on that business trip.  Now that she finally made it, she was completely satisfied with the visit.  She loved it just as much as I did.

For anyone who hasn't been here, you've got to come check this place out."}
{"text":"Back in Arizona for some Sun and Chino Bandido. My wife and I found this place all thanks to Yelp. Our first time in we not only had lunch, but we ordered more Ginger chicken Burritos to go. We are back in Arizona and tonight we will be taking the folks to Chino Bandido for a fusion feast. I'm glad we live in Seattle as Chino gives us something to look forward to. 

Best eats: 
Ginger Chicken 
Pollo Diable 
Jade Red Chicken 
Jerk Fried Rice"}
{"text":"The food tasted great and I loved the decor.  They have a 12,000 lb black granite panda wearing a sombrero.  That was too cool.  The food was great and not expensive, but the menu was a disaster and you had to study how to write in the proper codes before you could order.  This really wasn't needed as we were the only people in line.  Also I got sick after eating this junk, it only last for ~4hours but it still sucked."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews for this place. So much so that I would be willing to give this place another try. Perhaps I went too oriental and not enough Mexican, by ordering the Jerk Chicken Fried Rice Combo w/o beans with Jade Red Chicken and BBQ pork. The Jerk Chicken Fried Rice I really liked. The Jade Red Chicken was good but not super amazing. The BBQ pork was just ok. I'd probably go for the burrito or quesadilla next time. The guy giving out samples and our orders was super awesome though. He calls out your name like you're an old friend! Loved that. And let's not forget the free cookie with your meal! What service!"}
{"text":"The Red Jade Chicken with Jerk style fried rice. Perfection."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona just for a few days and my buddy had took us here to grab some lunch. This place is so BOMB!

It's a Chinese/Mexican infusion that serves authentic Chinese flavor mixed with some Mexican taste.

I ordered the emerald chicken with gringo quesadilla. It came with your choice of black bean or refried beans they are topped with cheese and your choice of rice-plain fried rice is the best from what I think. The flavored was all there fam! The emerald chicken has the right amount of ginger spice.

I am def coming back again!"}
{"text":"I bring all my out of town friends here and have them try all the samples at the \"never ever\" counter...been eating here fir 27 years and my favorite is 4 - 7 Black veggie!"}
{"text":"Peeps of Yelp - We saw the review of Chino  Bandito on Check Please AZ, and were intrigued. Chinese and Mexican - My two favorite cuisines.  I gotta go to this place - STAT!  I persuaded the spousal unit to join me on the 18 mile trek (36 round trip).

First off - The menu -  You need a tutorial to understand the ordering procedure - confusing and very off putting.

The highly touted black beans were strange tasting.  The carnitas were either not carnitas or like no carnitas I've ever experienced - with shredded  veggies in it?  Really? - very meh.  Pork fried Rice was good.  Egg Foo Yung was good.  

Net - Net:  Been There - Done That.  Going back?  Highly doubtful."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Yelp comes through once again. I never want this deliciousness to end and actually considering opening a location in Orange County so it won't have to. Will somehow need to figure out how to replicate the service because the people here are so nice, helping me order bc everything sounded amazing and I didn't know how to narrow it down. 

I had just come from the gym and hesitant to get anything fried (although as you will soon see, my willpower only went so far), and they were so great in suggesting I try the jade red chicken with grilled chicken instead of fried. I had also wanted the emerald chicken and they said it's really good in a quesadilla so I quickly obliged. Both were phenomenal. The black beans were a little salty for me but had great flavor and as much as my brain told me to get a salad instead of fried rice, my stomach won that one. I had only planned on having half of it, but in an uncontrollable frenzy, nearly finished the entire thing. 

Chino Bandido will be added to the must-visit eats next time I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So fabulous.  We weren't sure how to order but people in line were helpful and then taste testings at the order desk with such helpful, patient people.  Red jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken -some in quesadilla's -the black beans and fresh pinto beans were to die for.  Planning what we want to try next!!!  Just awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on vacation and the service was great! It was our first time here and I'm guessing we had that awkward look when we walking in because we were asked if it was our first time there. We got samples of the food we were thinking of trying and it was definitely delicious. Overall I had a great experience with the service and the food, also it is very inexpensive! I went in thinking I was going to pay a little bit extra considering it was on DDD but got a sweet surprise as my bill. I'm definitely going back before I leave!"}
{"text":"how can you not love a place who's logo is a panda bear dressed in a sombrero? its completely impossible. the hilarity alone sold me but the mere fact that this place serves two cuisines that i could eat every day for the rest of my life doesn't really hurt either.

just to warn you, if you're not prepared you may be overwhelmed by the menu at first. there are a lot of check boxes, a lot of acronyms, a lot of \"what the hell did i just tell the woman i wanted to eat?\". have no fear, they have pictures for some recommended combinations.  i suggest going with those for first timers. it just makes your life easier and the only question you really have to answer is what kind of rice you want. not so bad. they also give you a goodly sized snickerdoodle cookie to munch on after you've gorged yourself on chinamex food. seriously, is this place trying to make me fat? i know, they didn't hold a gun to my head but i felt obligated to eat the whole thing + cookie. it was my duty =p."}
{"text":"This place is so popular! For non-natives, this is essentially a combination of chinese and mexican food~ They serve mexican dishes with chinese inspiration. With that said, the lady who helped us was SO nice. I was having some trouble filling out the menu (theres a little menu that you fill out and just give to the cashier) Our food came out relatively quickly. Being a fatty, I ordered the 2 item combination with jade chicken (orange chicken with a bit of a kick) and a quesadilla with hengrenade chicken (supposed to be a not as spicy version of jerk chicken) with black beans and white rice. It was quite delicious! The portions were good, not too large but big enough where I couldn't finish it all. The beans were interesting as they were pureed (usually when you order black beans they come out whole) and it does come with cheese on the top. The hengrenade chicken was really delicious inside of the quesadilla and the jade chicken was quite good! (I was just expecting regular orange chicken but I was suprised by the slight spiciness). Overall, I thought it was good for the price, the service was good. It wasn't the cleanest looking restaurant (though if you were expecting a very mexican-ish restaurant like those you find in california, that's what you'll get!) I did quite like it and I would come back again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food! Mexican and Chinese fusion! Great for the family and the kids. Service is very friendly and they'll allow you to sample the different meats to help you make a decision at the front counter. Never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Arizona! I now live in Scottsdale and sometimes make the trip all the way to that side of town just for Chino. Been going for years and will continue to go. I always end up getting the same thing. The jade chicken, emerald chicken and jerk rice and the black beans. Amazing!! And then they throw in an awesome tasting cookie with it. If you want a good new taste and amazing food Chino is a good new place to try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It may look intimidating when approaching the counter but the helpfull staff guides you through the ordering process while loading you up with samples. With the concept, the quality of food, the execution of the concept, as well as the staff, I can can honestly say that place is an instant classic.

If you like Mexican Food as well as Chines Food, then this place will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Took the family and all ate great meals. I love eating something different and this was different but very good.  

I told the guy taking the order that this was a first time and he spent time giving everyone in the family multiple samples so we could decide what to get.  Good service, marketing and sales. 

I would recommend Chino Bandido to anyone wanting a variation on mexican food."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but now I am a believer -Chino Bandido you are a rare breed. 
YOU MUST: try anything and everything you won't regret it! 
SO what the place is a little dive like but only the BEST places are! 
SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Interesting asian/mexican fusion theme but taste is just ok. Great place to go if you just want to fill your stomach for a cheap price.

Best part about it is the snicker doodle they give you with the meal.

Ordering is kind of odd but nice that you can make anything a burrito, quesadilla or just eat it alone for all the same price.

Place is bare bones, with cafeteria type tables/benches."}
{"text":"Best dang Chinese-Mexican food I've ever had. And the snicker doodles that come complimentary are the best! The place itself doesn't look the nicest, but the food is amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for dinner was my first and she hasn't been there since high school which I think was when the wheel was invented. Menu is a bit confusing but they are great and helped us through it. Very friendly employees and eager to help. Food was really good Chinese and Mexican infusion. Would have given 5 stars but the place is a bit dated maybe the owner will invest and update the interior. Other then that everything else was great and will return in future."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places of all time. The food there is amazing. In my opinion you have to try the Jade Red chicken, Black Beans, and chile rellanos. It does look like kinda a dive from the outside but it's very clean inside and the staff is very nice and helpful. The main reason to go is the food though the combination of Chinese and Mexican is great and they give you plenty of food for your money. The other great thing is the snicker doodle cookies there they are the best ones I have ever had and better yet you get a free one with every meal. But take my advice just order a dozen yep they are that good."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food is as bizarre as it is delicious.  And, they'll let you try before you buy!

Half the time, the place is packed, but don't fear the long line or the daunting task of filling out your order.  You'll be at the counter quickly, and if you have no idea what to do with that piece of paper, just take it up there blank.  They'll figure it out for you.

Great place."}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be,  I ordered the jade chicken which I usually get because it's my favorite and when it came out  my meal looked like it had been  sitting out for quite a while,  I had asked for salsa to freshen it up a bit and they gave me this nasty tomato sauce. I don't understand what happened to this place even the staff looked lazy. Please fix this"}
{"text":"Miss this place. Used to work in the computer repair store next to Walgreen's and this was an amazing place for lunch. Disappointed, but I will make the haul to PHX for Chino."}
{"text":"Awesome food mixtures, good is great and location is very clean. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes mex and Chinese food."}
{"text":"Not my absolute favorite restaurant in East Valley, but tasty enough to keep us coming back. I will be honest though, a big reason that this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because my husband and I have found NO other Chinese food in the area that is edible (if anyone has recommendations, I am all ears!). The jerk chicken was chewy with quite a bit of gristle. The Jade Red Chicken is my favorite, similar to a VERY spicy combination of S&S Chicken and General Tso's at your typical Chinese hole-in-the-wall. Some people love the black beans, but they are way too salty for our taste, while the refried variety have no flavor to speak of. If you are extra hungry, you can get a combo plate that comes with your choice of fried rice varieties, either bean, and two smaller portions of a meat (or veggie). You can get your meat on a quesadilla or in a burrito for no extra cost! The decor is simple; a large number of very long, heavy-duty plastic tables, lined up in L-formation in the restaurant. They face a huge flat-screen TV, which seems to always be tuned to ESPN. Order at the counter, give them your name, and then they bring the food out to you in foil to-go containers. Quick service, moderately priced food. Would be great for a large group. Not sure if young kids could handle the spice, though. My nose ran for hours after eating here!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to Chandler only to be served cold Chinese food in a cavernous (and empty) retail location.  I'd read all the rave reviews about Jade Red Chicken and was amped for some kick ass grub.  Three different people I know personally  all told me I needed to check out CB as well and one of my buds, whose culinary curiosity is on par with mine, says he literally craves this stuff.

I was pretty stoked to try something new tonite for dinner as we tend to get bogged down in central phoenix and eat at the same places over & over again.  It's Friday nite, I'd had a few beers after work and had  a pretty light lunch, so I was beyond peckish and downright ready for the taste sensation I expected Chino Bandido to be.  My better half and I drove from CenPho down to the culturally devoid center of the Universe (aka Chandler), hungry and excited.  We'd read the reviews, used the interactive menu tool on the CB website and we were pumped for an excellent, if not quirky dinging experience.  Not.  ;(

The restaurant itself is in a bizarre, gravelly strip mall, oddly wedged between a nail salon and a store called simply \"Wide Shoes\".  We walked in to what felt like a vacant student union during spring break - -when everyone else is in Ft. Lauderdale, Rocky Point or the Caribbean and you're the only kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your library job.  There were maybe 25-30 other diners in the place but it is so huge inside that it felt empty and barren.

We were greeted by a nice-enough counter lady who took our orders and punched them into the register.  I felt somewhat robbed of the paper-menu ordering experience I'd heard so much about -- no challenge, nothing unique.   We grabbed our drinks, utensils and straws and settled in at the end of a LOOOONG vacant  Rubbermaid folding table. Jason asked why they had church buffet tables set up.  I thought maybe there was something cool about them....but nope...just cheap tables.  We looked around a bit while we waited for our food to come over and raised our eyebrows questioningly at one another. I kept waiting to \"get it\" -- which I figured we would when the food arrived.

There were some screaming kids running around while their parents ignored them, chatted with one another and texted.  (BRATS! BRATS!! BRATS!!!  Get outta my yard!!  ...I yelled inside my head like that mean old lady from down the block when I was a kid). 

My annoyance with bad parenting aside --I couldn't figure out why everyone loved this place. It has all the ambiance of a med-clinic. I felt like at any minute a middle-aged woman in chili-pepper-embellished scrubs would shuffle over, hand me a clipboard with a flower-shaped pen, ask me to sign a release form and pay my co-pay.  There wasn't even MUZAK playing -- there was NO music playing which made the place seem even more devoid of life.

The food soon arrived and we dug in eagerly. Everything was a smidge above room temp -- if that, and pretty boring to be frank. The Jade Red Chicken is pretty comparable to Panda Express' orange chicken.  The BBQ'd pork didn't seem to have any asian BBQ flavor -- more like roasted pork soaked in sugar and the cold, thick refried beans could have come from Taco Bell or a can. Nothing unordinary or even interesting here. The only thing that was in the least bit interesting was the pork fried rice which tasted oddly like it'd been cooked with cheap white sherry and shallots -- which I've not experienced before with fried rice. That was \"atypical\" but certainly not interesting or enchanting.  The only redeeming thing about the meal was the Snickerdoodle which seemed oddly out of place for either Mexican or Asian food.  It was pretty good though.

Even though I was physically full after the meal I felt very emotionally empty, oddly depressed about Chandler, its environs and its residents.  Everyone else in the joint seemed oddly devoid of emotion as -- certainloy not like people who go out to dinner on a Friday evening.  

I'm thinking we should have aimed the car towards the original Chino Bandido in the Aves.  I am  a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so I'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods.  I'm thinking that the original divey joint didn't translate well to Chandler, so I'm willing to give CB another try -- just never again in the east valley. 

Please someone explain to me what I'm missing here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I always get the fresh tortillas with the spicy black beans and fried rice and get extra to take home. The hot sauce is heavenly. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the combined flavors and the way they mix. Staff is always so nice, especially to new comers"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD.

The first time you eat here, it will be a bit confusing, but they make the process of introduction easy and fun. You go up to the counter and try samples of everything, then make your order on a sheet. They bring it to your table along with one of their beloved Snickerdoodle cookies.

I've never become so addicted to anything in my life. The combination of fresh chinese and authentic mexican food is unreal. It's so good us Californians are begging our Arizona friends to Fed Ex this stuff back. The Red Jerk Chicken -THE BEST"}
{"text":"I personally don't understand why everyone likes this place, probably just the fact that it was on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.  I could care less if a place has been on TV or if a famous person has been there, those opinions don't influence me at all.  Anyways, I hate the ordering process, you fill out a piece of paper with what you want and how you want it, confusing if you haven't been there before.  The place is filthy, reminds me of a soup kitchen.  The service isn't bad but they should work on cleaning the place up.  I don't see how anyone can say the quality of the food is good.  Below average Chinese food crossed with below average Mexican food equals garbage if you ask me."}
{"text":"Asian/Mexican/Jamaican Food.  Why not?

This place has had tons of reviews and was of course featured on flavor town.  I have driven by it over the years but for some reason it just never appealed to me.  I like all of these cuisines separate but combined never felt appetizing.  

Well I finally decided the time may never be right but I was curious enough to give it a try.

I ordered a couple of combos so we could try a good variety.  I got one with red pork, a carnitas quesadilla, black beans, and jerk rice.  The other combo was emerald chicken, chile relleno, pinto beans, and pork fried rice.

It was all pretty interesting.
The carnitas quesadilla was probably the best of them.  Nicely seasoned and spiced carnitas with cheese and a tortilla.  Pretty straight forward but tasty.

The chile relleno had some kind of crunchy texture on the outside and was different but also good.

The emerald chicken was a bit plain and had too much ginger and onion that overpowered the rest.

The red pork was all sweet and no heat.  I would have much rather it been spicy.

The beans were both equally decent.  Same for the rice.  The pork fried rice was probably a tad better.

They threw in some sugar cookies that were thick and soft.  As well as some hot sauce that was mild but flavorful.

This is a to go place so the inside was really bare but there were some tables and chairs in a room off to the side.

I would probably come back I guess I am not really sure.  I didn't love it but didn't hate it either.  I am kind of leaning towards if I want Chinese food I will go get Chinese and if I want Mexican I would probably just go get Mexican.  As I ate it I just felt like I had left overs from a Chinese place and leftovers from a Mexican place in the fridge and I just threw them all on one plate on a hungover Saturday morning and went at it."}
{"text":"Interesting place as the general restaurant suggests Chinese and Mexican fusion.  It wasn't for me though.  Panda Express on some weird spin.  I know some people love it but not me.  It was cool that they let me taste a lot of the dishes for free before ordering."}
{"text":"Place is a bit dirty and food is average to below average. Teriyaki chicken under seasoned. Glad I tried it but unlikely to return. Place was packed so i guess some people love it. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I really hate to give anyone a rating of just 1 star, but giving even one star, is a stretch.  Before I get too negative, the people in this restaurant, were some of the nicest, anywhere in Phoenix.  They were knowledgeable about what they were selling, and they were very, very friendly.  First of all, this location, was pretty dirty.  The table we had to sit at, was the cleanest that was available, but it had food, all over the place. The floors had food, napkins and garbage all over the place.  Secondly, the prices for what we ordered, were a little outrageous.  $20.00, for two of us to eat the smallest portion, that was available.  Mine was so bad, I can't even remember what it was called, the number 13, I believe.  The chicken was tough, and it had so much garlic in it, I'll smell like a garlic factory, for days.  My wife got the Teryaki Chicken(normally, the safest one on the menu), but she said that the glaze was like something she'd pour down the drain.  The one good food item, was the snickerdoodle cookie, I got.  It was pretty good.  Eating here, kinda reminded me of being a young Marine, stationed in Japan, in the early 70's.  I got so homesick for some Italian food, I went into this local restaurant, in Iwakuni, and ordered some lasagna.  Big, Big mistake.  Back then, the Japanese, just couldn't make decent Italian food.  And you know how Marine's are, we'll eat just about anything.
     Well, I know food is like art.  It's subjective.  Either my taste buds are off, or something is very, very wrong.  This place is always busy, but you know what they say, \"fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\".  I won't be spending any more of my money, in this place.  Sorry Chino Bandido.  I know your sign says \"Takee Outee\", but the only thing I can think of to takee outee, is your food, to the garbagee."}
{"text":"I did no preparation for Chino Bandido, all I had was the word of Duke Christopher and Yelp Elite Super Royalty Michael R and Matt R. All said, we HAD TO GO TO CHINO BANDIDO. Once in Phoenix/Scottsdale, we picked a day that we would go here, which is when I FINALLY looked at. Chinese Mexican Combinations. WHAT?! I thought my mind was ready. It was NOT. It sounded so strange, but everything looked so good. Optimize your stop here and get the bowl with 2 items. You can leave the meat in the bowl as is or put it in one of their other options (quesadilla or burrito). My choice was the Chinese BBQ Pork (my favorite of the 2 items, which I left as just the meat) and the Hengrenade Chicken (because it is milder than the Jerk Chicken option) in a quesadilla. Everything came out hot and fresh, the meat was tender and flavorful. And the Snickerdoodle Cookies. AH THE COOKIES. You must get a cookie. Do it. I ate way too much, but I found it really, really delicious."}
{"text":"It's alright, and by alright I mean I would come here every day if I could. Definitely not the healthiest of foods, but also definitely the tastiest of foods. You probably only have to eat once a day because this food bloats you so quickly. The menu is simple, order a combo with two entrees (as a quesadilla, burrito, or plain), with beans and rice, all the other stuff is too complicated even as a biomedical engineer. My personal combo is a machaca quesadilla, Pollo Diablo, black beans and pork fried rice. Everyone else seems to just order a Jade red chicken with white rice (so basic). Try new stuff, literally you can try everything on the menu before ordering like all the other noobs that come here or you can call ahead like a veteran and come in and out. It's basically your own fault if you think they take a long time to make food. Also, weekend cookies, the volcano cookies are great and so are oatmeal raisin, but I hate raisins so I prefer  the basic snickerdoodle over that. One tip if you take home though, use the plastic forks. Eating with metal silverware on the aluminium container just feels weird, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place isn't the best looking, but it's pretty tasty! I find myself craving the strange mix of foods they serve here.
I order the Emerald chicken burrito and the Jerk Chicken quesadillas.
The best part is if you've never been there before, they give you tons of samples and tell you all about the foods you can order. 
I wish they had more locations :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered here about 5 times and each time was wonderful. 

I absolutely love the black beans. The texture is smooth and creamy and they taste delicious.

The portions are generous and the price is right."}
{"text":"I've been here atleast 40x times over the yrs.. lol. Food is always great & consistent, service is even better. If it's your first time go in advance & sample the nummy's... if not, why are you reading this review. (You know this is the spot) This place is THE local go to, I recommend that you do too. However, I do advise take out if you have a young family... The dining room can get pretty busy. & js... Jade chicken & Jerk fried rice is amazing af! Don't think, do it!"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would allow us to review other people's reviews. Snobbery and being an asshole shouldn't make you an \"Elite\" yelper. 

This place is the spot which is probably why it's always packed when we go. My favorite order is the Jade Red Chicken with rice. The combo with quesadillas with Jade Red Chicken is bomb too. 

You'll find this place has a mix crowd and a low-key vibe. Definitely a must stop!"}
{"text":"So far my 1st time experience with this place was...interesting. It was with my boss and 1 co-worker. I guess you can say that I'm iffy when it comes to mixing two totally different foods together. For the most part, I've seen alot of Chinese/Vietnamese places, but with Mexican food? I got the sweats just thinking how awful it would taste when you mix soy sauce and salsa together....eh. 

When we step in, there is a strange odor. It doesn't look very clean, and my boss shows me the paper we had to fill out to order. He's been there a couple times and it seemed like he was still having problems figuring out how to write a few things. I felt like I was filling out a test trying to fill the form out, a lot of abbreviations (not that hard to remember), and numbers. Not sure if I would like this place. 

We go in line and nobody helps me get a sample, so I step back in the regular line so I don't lose my spot. I got the emerald chicken burrito...the wrap smelled kinda funky, but I ate most of it. I don't think it's sitting too well with me. They both got combos and drinks, it came out to $27, which I thought is a bit pricey for chinese/mexican fastfood, but I also have never tried this place before...better luck next time..maybe?"}
{"text":"We have been here many times, great combination of Chineese and Mexican. The cookies are great and there is something for everyone in our family."}
{"text":"Saw this place on food network show DDD and had to try it. It was ok. Not mind blowing but not blah or eww either. Jade red chicken was good but I could taste ketchup when eating it. Fried rice was ok nothing amazing. Service was very friendly and helpful. They let us sample ever meat on the menu before ordering. For the service I would give them four stars. But yeah the concept of this place is much cooler than the taste of its food. Fun idea, I'd try it again if I was in the area but I wouldn't crave it. Go there... See for yourself."}
{"text":"If that emerald chicken wasn't the best thing ever!!! They could use some egg rolls or crab rangoon though."}
{"text":"I have heard of the place for a while and have wanted to try it, but I thought is was way out in b.f.e so I never gave it much thought after that. Shame on me! I went there today for the first with my dad. The place is clean and simple (basic little hole in wall). As soon as you walk in, the staff is nice a friendly and SUPER helpful if you've never been there before. Anyways, the food is what you really wanna know about. This is, hands down, the best Chinese food I have had. The red jade chicken is perfect. Sweet, a little spicy, and crisp from the breading (some places there chicken like that is soggy and not very good). The refried beans are so yummy as well, I just wish they were a little thicker. The fried rice is amazing as well as the carnitas (I know I spelled that wrong) not dry or tough. The hype is real, if you haven't gone, do yourself a favor and do it."}
{"text":"Chinese-Mexican-Jamaican fusion cuisine.....who knew?!?  Well, evidently a lot of people now, thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  We've been twice (we're only in Phoenix twice a year, or we'd probably be here once a week, at least!)

The BF had his fave, chile relleno.  It comes coated with crunchy Panko crumbs, which he loved.  This time I had the emerald chicken, with a sauce like a ginger-green onion pesto that rocked my taste buds.  I also had the jen-red pork; the meat was a little dry. (The jade-red chicken, which is similar, had more moist meat when I had that last time and seemed to fit the sauce better.)

We both had the black beans, which are highly flavored and have a hint of heat. They beat all other beans I've ever had anywhere else.  Their machaca is the same in that respect - uniquely flavored and heads above the rest (no egg in this version, in case you're looking for them.)

There are 4 rice choices (I am not a rice person, so I can't comment fairly here.)  There are also many more entree choices, including an all-vegetable dish.  I'm sure we'll get around to each and every one in subsequent visits!"}
{"text":"Quite an interesting concept that I had not been privy to trying before finding it randomly on a lunch break in the heart of upper Phoenix. 

Let's get the complaint out of the way early. If this place is half Mexican, then you need to have some salsa or some Mexican sauce next to the soy sauce. Alot of food I found myself pouring soy sauce on because it lacked a bit of a punch and flavor. If they can pull that off, then things would be alot better because my veggie quesadilla was solid, but using soy sauce on that product was not the best choice. The plain fried rice was exactly what I wanted and although they only have a handful of chicken breast choices, the one I picked was good. It was with the green sauce and ginger combo and I ordered that in the combination with that quesadilla for about eight bucks. They probably don't need that sampling station in the front either, it just looks cheesy. Of course, the snickerdoodle cookie was a nice surprise and very tasty, that item may be worth buying a dozen, but maybe sneak your own hot sauce in the place if you want some extra flavor."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives. The menu can be confusing for first time customers but staff are very helpful when it comes to navigating through the process. 

If you and a person you're with can't decide on what to eat, this is a great alternative. My wife enjoys Mexican food where I prefer Asian. When you put these two together, Chino Bandido is born. 

You can order your meal three ways; Bowl, Burrito or Quesadilla. I usually get the bowl and stick with a customer favorite, Jade Red Chicken. This particular night I tried the Red Pork, Chinese BBQ Pork, Pork Fried Rice and some Refried Beans. All was extremely tasty and definitely filled the belly.

I challenge you to try something new tonight... be adventurous and stop by the Chino Bandido for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Saw this places on Food Network's Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.  Man, this place was WAY WAY better than it was on TV.  

Chino Bandido is a fusion of Mexican, Chinese, and Jamaican food.  I had the Emerald & Jade Red Chicken with Jamaican jerk fried rice.  Also a order of chicken quesadillas. I can not say the last time I was so satisfied with a meal.  The Emerald Chicken is by one of the best things I ever had.  And the Jerk fried rice was different, but very good.

The service was great.  We told the cashier that it was our first time here and that we saw it from Triple D.  He was more then helpful with suggestions, giving us samples to try.  We came in for lunch and the place was pretty busy, so when the server brought out our order, she threw in a couple of snicker-doodle cookies for our wait.  We was so impressed because our order only took 10-12 mins to come out.  I like that they make costumer service. 

Another thing this place has going for it is the price.  Very low, which made this place a huge value for what your getting.  

The Staff are all very friendly and everyone seem to get along great together.  All eager to make you feel welcomed.  The restaurant doesn't look very big outside but on the inside its very spacious.  It has the cashier on the right and a huge cafeteria area on the right.  Very clean.  

Its located in a shopping center next to other eatery, so parking is not a issue.

I love this place.  It has amazing value!  The food taste great.  Thank you Triple D, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to take the family and entertain some wild and crazy food options. Been coming here on and off since 1990 and not much has changed.

The food served here is an interesting fusion of Asian and Mexican with some hints of Jamaica. You basically walk up and fill out your meal ticket and hand it to the person at the counter. They are always very helpful and will even give you a sample to try out.

Normally order one of the spicy dishes. The Diablo Chicken and the Jaded Chicken or Pork are a couple of my favorites. I've probably tried everything once or twice and it is all interestingly good.

This is not a fancy restaurant and the strip mall that it is in is a bit ghetto. Inside has a large sitting area and there is a huge TV playing for those who like watch while they eat. Football for me today.

Come on over and get your groove on or check out their other Chandler location. It is much newer and not as dated as this location. Not everyone may like this place. It is surely a different spin on fast food and worth checking out. COOKIE!

3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"ALLLLLLLLLLLLL HYPE!!!!!!!

Decent mexican, decent chinese, decent.  Thats it.  The ordering process is facking ridiculous.  All those people fawking over the jade red chicken are out of their minds.  The jade red chicken tastes like ketchup and hot sauce.  Thats the sauce.  Avoid the hype.  It is not cool to eat here no matter how bad you want it to be.  save your money, any Bertos or half bit chinese will do.  make your own fusion."}
{"text":"My brother went to another location and was absolutely in love with it.  He wanted to take me, so we came to the Chandler location.  While he seemed pleased with his food, I was rather disappointed.
First, it wasn't hot.  At best, mildly warm, which was pathetic because it was ready pretty quickly.  Second, I ordered the egg foo yung vegitarian, but what i received was a sloppy burnt mess loaded with pork (and there's another problem, it was burnt yet not hot).  And lastly, my chile relleno quesadilla was overrun with greasy cheese, almost unbearable.  
My first trip here wasn't good, but there are other locations, and this is not that spot that my brother raved about.  There are other items on the menu that i'd like to try, so I might just give it another shot."}
{"text":"The jerk fried rice is silly good. I had the jade chicken that was also really good. The process of placing your order can be a bit confusing if you are new to this place however they have some employees to help you if it is your first time ordering."}
{"text":"Homg. This place is SO FREAKING GOOD.

IF YOU LIKE ORANGE CHICKEN (aka Americanized Chinese food) GET THE JADE CHICKEN.

Let me preface this with: \"Fusion\" food is usually stupid. It tries to be trendy and creative but is usually overpriced and just.. tastes stupid.

Not Chino Bandido. Their jade chicken and jerk rice combo is AMAZING with their beans. Oh my gosh.

A gem in Phoenix. I can't believe I found something (that's Asian-ish) unique and delicious in Arizona that I know I can't find or recreate anywhere else.

The racist artwork and decor are 10much but since the employees are Asian.. I guess.. it's ok...? God, the food  was so good that I don't even care about the racist how-to-speak Chinese flyer near the entrance.

WOULD TOTALLY COME BACK. P.S. The Diablo Pollo is garlic-heavy and actually tastes Szechuan.

And hello??? A free cookie with every bowl???? THE FIVE STARS IS A NO BRAINER."}
{"text":"I like the refried beans and the various fried Chinese chicken dishes.  I like the combo idea and the concept.  It is kinda hidden behind the auto center but worth looking for."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last 9 years...this place is the best. Chinese and Mexican fusion food to die for and the owners are so nice! First timers can sample each dish and they will help you get accustomed to their menu and order slip. Very homey \"hole in the wall\" (the original home location on 19th and greenway). And don't get me started on the snickerdoodles....UH-MAZING."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The food is tasty and inexpensive.  The place is campy and take a moment to figure out the order sheets.  Did I say the food was inexpensive and tasty?  The food comes in a tin, very simple.  The enviroment is basic and a bit worn.  We want to give the Chandler location a try."}
{"text":"If your down for some  Chinese/mexican fun. This is your place. Don't expect anything less than plastic forks. You'll feel Guilty for how bad the food was for you. But lets face it..... Nothing super yummy is great for ya!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Chino Bandido for years! The food is amazing! I always get the Jade Red chicken...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Amazing black beans! Spicy and well seasoned, the black beans I ate here are the best since having them in Guatemala! We paired the rice and beans with the Red Jade Chicken which was pretty good, but mmmmmmmmm, the black beans are the best! Hubby was a love and brought home two delicious meals for about $20. Hubby is also the best, next to the black beans, of course! Thank you, Hubby!"}
{"text":"We love Chino back! The Jade red chicken, the jerk chicken, the Emerald chicken. Get it in a bowl, get it in a quesadilla, get it in a burrito. But whatever you do get black beans! And wash it all down with a cookie we prefer the snickerdoodle but some prefer the chocolate."}
{"text":"As a Jamaican American lost in the Sonaran Desert in search of Caribbean inspired food, Chino Bandino is an oasis! The jerk chicken bowl is well seasoned with authentic Jamaican Jerk flavors!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cheat day spots. The menu is unique as it puts a twist on Asian and Mexican cuisine. Due to the uniqueness, there is a sample station where you can try all the different food items. Along with your order you get a free snickerdoodle or peanut butter cookie! Give it a try if you're in the area. It normally gets pack around lunch time but don't let that intimidate you because they normally get the food out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Just a classic spot. The jade red chicken is a must. The cuban black beans and jerk fried rice are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall mixing Asian and Mexican flavors together. 

If you haven't been here before there is a counter where you can get samples of the meat dishes they have. Once you have an idea of what you want the staff writes up your ticket. You can do a small bowl of one entree with rice or go big with one entree, rice and beans. It gets better, you can pick between 4 rice options: plain, fried rice, jerk fried rice and pork fried rice.

We got the popular entree which is Jade Red Chicken with jerk fried rice. The Jade Red Chicken is crispy fried pieces of chicken with a sweet glaze sauce. Next up was their Emerald Ginger chicken with white rice and Hengrenade Jerk Chicken with pork friend rice.

Everything was super tasty and a place to go back to when we are visiting the desert."}
{"text":"I've never regretted spending 20 dollars the way I have after this place. I should of been warned by the empty restaurant, I wish I was those kind of people that have no shame and cause a scene demanding there money back!! Oh how I want my money back :( lol ... the rice is hard and crunchy and different colors (jerk rice) the jade chicken that is oh so recommended as there #1 seller,  is stale and dry,  I could bet money that most of the food on my plate was old, it wasn't even warm. Also had the carnitas quesadilla, please stay away. I feel sick, the flavor caused me to feel discomfort at thought of eating, so hard to explain.  The staff was nice, but thats about it. P.s. the sugar cookie or whatever it is that they give was also stale. I would of been better off eating at McDonald's ordering from the dollar menu. . . 
Ohhhh how those 20 dollars hurt my heart.  Lol"}
{"text":"Cool concept. Liked the quesadilla options best. Salsa is subpar. Jerk chicken rice is good."}
{"text":"This place is effin' amazing. I love it. I could eat the Red Jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken, all day, everyday. It's delicious. Chino is unique and full of flavor. The place is ALWAYS BUSY! 

P.s. it's not the cleanest joint (in regards to the tables/floors being 100% wiped down) but for a hole in the wall Chinese-Mexican joint it is WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great first visit to Chino Bandido! The food was excellent, fun and unique!"}
{"text":"Ordering looks like a challenge at first bit it's not ! Highly recommend the JENRED pork it's like sweet and sour pork but with a spicy twist .. Portions are good and they serve your meal with a snickerdoodle or chocolate chip homemade cookie ! It's a hole in the wall with super awesome food!"}
{"text":"Chino bandidos is probably not one of the best restaurants in the valley.....But it is one of the top 3 most delightfully INTERESTING dining combinations I have experienced anywhere on the planet so far. 

Mexican & Chinese with a twist of Jamaican is a crazy combo of taste variations to find in the desert. This uniquely American melting pot concept seems to pull it off really against all odds in my mind ....

I can still remember my bewilderment the first time I was exposed to this mexi-nees-ican (?) menu and absolutely friggin LOVE to bring people here to watch their reaction.

Also the 7,500 pound mascot in the dining room has to be mentioned at least once... and maybe photographed several times just be cheesy.  

Although I have had EVERYTHING on the menu at least once. My favorite is the Jerk Chicken. Served on a bed of rice and enjoyed with a Red Stripe, it's what I came all the way to the Sunny Slope area for.  Any time I possibly could. That, and the snikerdoodle that was carefully stowed away in the trunk safely for a midnight session.

These days they have 2 locations and the new one is just as far away as the original. I will faithfully drive where ever they are in the valley maybe once a year. The staff will let you try what ever you want.  And I have never taken anyone who didn't like it. Just know that you can combine EVERYTHING so maybe get creative ...on your second or third time...

 Don't be demure on asking what other ppl/staff like...Everything's good in my opinion... Neighborhood atmosphere ...Some of it's greasy as all hell but great food none the less."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is maybe the oddest restaurant I've ever been to, with the strangest combinations of food, but I can't get enough of it! Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean all together at one restaurant? Count me in. I live in California now and all my friends here know about Chino's because it always happens to come up in conversation (totally my fault). When they come to visit me in Arizona, Chino's is our first meal. I honestly could not recommend this place enough! 

Everything I've tried here has exceeded my expectations and I'm somehow okay with eating fried rice, refried beans, and teriyaki chicken all in the same bite now. All the entrees you order can be made in a burrito or quesadilla as well, but the burritos are essentially just whatever meat you order wrapped in a tortilla so I usually go for the quesadillas or leave the meat as is to eat with rice and beans. If it's your first time, they'll even give you samples of the most popular items when you walk in!

Not only is the food delicious (I usually get a combo with a jade red chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, jerk fried rice, and refried beans) but the service is quick and easy. And on top of that, you get a free snickerdoodle with your order! It's the best. Go in with an empty stomach and get ready to be blown away, but if there's any takeaway from this review, it should be to get the jade red chicken quesadilla every single time you go. Seriously, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had raved about this place to our kids telling them we found it while living out there 9years ago. We just went back and visited bringing our two children who really enjoyed it as well, this time I got the Emerald chicken and Jade chicken both SO delicious!!! The flavor does not waver. I really enjoyed going back and having it taste just the same as it did before. We'll make it a point to visit when we're in town."}
{"text":"oh hell to the naw...I went to this place for the first time because hubby said he saw it on tv the day before and let me tell you, the service or lack was sooooo bad.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food, 45 FREAKIN MINUTES!!!!!!!! and the only reason my hubby didnt complain was because sports center was on.  Now let me get to the food the fried rice is ok and the the red jade chicken was fine also, but nothing I would drive 20 minutes to get to ever again in my life.  But I will give them one star because my better half liked his food a little better than I did.  Oh and let me not forget those free cookies which we got about 8 of probably because they had us waiting so long.  And that would have been all good if they didnt crumble and taste like sand paper in your mouth except for the huge chunks of chocolate chips that my hubby pointed out."}
{"text":"Very interesting! I've tried korean/mexican fusion but this is my first time trying chinese/mexican fusion and I LIKE it! =D

Got the combo plate with Hengrenade Chicken, Machaca, Black Beans and white rice....the Hengrenade Chicken was really kicking my butt! The spiciness doesn't kick u in the mouth until a few minutes later after swallowing it. Nonetheless it was very delicious..I didn't get anything that was Chinese but my bf did order the Carnitas, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans and plain fried rice combo...the Jade Red Chicken was really good. So for a combo of two things and the choice of rice and beans is $7.25....it doesn't come with a drink but it does come with a delicious snickerdoodle cookie! 

Needless to say we both enjoyed our yummy lunch here today. The only thing was I got a cup for water but I didn't drink the water because it was tainted with something pink....and I was a bit afraid of drinking it...=/ It's not a true hole in the wall restaurant so it was pretty spacious and clean. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't quite imagine Mexican food and Asian food together but it was so good! Lots of great options and you can mix and match to your hearts content! Open cafeteria type seating so it's not the best atmosphere and it can get loud but the food is great for a casual lunch or dinner and the portion sizes are large."}
{"text":"I feel the need to explain my 2-star rating, because I come here with regularity. Every so often I just jones for an emerald chicken quesadilla, smothered in their salsa. 

The service is hit & miss. There is one particular employee who is awful, the rest are okay - very friendly. But communication is not their strong suit. For example, one day I tried to order a rice bowl WITH a quesadilla. They did not tell me that I can't have a quesadilla with a rice bowl, so I ended up with emerald chicken over rice - no quesadilla. No warning, or I'd have changed my order. They also refused to fix my existing order, they told me I'd have to put in a new order for a quesadilla - no refund on the rice bowl I didn't want. Just today, I put in a to-go order and came home to find they put something... not emerald chicken, I don't know WHAT it is - in my quesadilla. In their defense, they were busy, and I'm sure it's hard to tell what's in a quesadilla. Just disappointing when literally, that is the only reason I go there.

Many people seem to love their fried rice - I don't think it's anything special. Likewise with the beans - they are good, not spectacular. I love the jade red chicken and the diablo chicken. The pork tends to be too fatty for my tastes. The cookies are okay. The SALSA is something special (don't miss it - they put it in a big container by the fountain drink dispenser), I love it and if they sold it in jars I'd probably buy it. 

The good news is that I did find the emerald chicken recipe online http://www.foodieslikeusblog.com/recipes/guy-fieri-dishes-on-tattoos-foodies-and-changing-lives/ (allll the way at the bottom) and I've made it - it really does replicate it well! The bad news is that 80% of the time I'm too lazy to make it myself... so back to Chino Bandido I go.

PS - Every so often... they run OUT of chicken. Really, it's the weirdest thing to me. How does a restaurant run out of chicken? But it's happened 3 times to me here. Since I go there for the chicken dishes, I just leave when that happens. 

PPS - I really hope the Chino staff doesn't see my review and muck with my food next time I go... I need a Yelp alias."}
{"text":"On the way back from a vacation to Antelope Canyon and the Grand Canyon with my roommate, we were determined to have one really good meal! We were originally going to get BBQ, but then she mentioned wanting to try this Chinese/Mexican fusion place next time she was in Phoenix, since we were 5 miles north of town, I said lets do it now! I'm glad we followed her suggestion!

This place looks kinda like a hole in the wall joint (my favorite) but the food does not disappoint. The staff was so friendly and took the time to explain the options and flavors AND gave us samples! Since their food is so unique, the samples were great because its going blind otherwise!  The servings were big (I had leftovers), the prices very reasonable, and the spices were not overwhelming. The Jerk Fried Rice has too many green onions for me, but most people like green onions. The BBQ pork quesadilla had a good amount of cheese and the sauce didn't make the tortilla soggy. And the red chicken something or other had a really good kick! AND YOU GET A COOKIE! 

The dinning room was old looking, like the rest of the building, but everything was clean! Even the bathrooms... 

AND YOU GET A COOKIE! 

The leftovers re-heated fairly well, I recommend re-heating in the stove, as opposed to the microwave, IF you happen to end up with leftovers.. 

Did I mention you get a cookie? :)"}
{"text":"Definite hole in the wall. Will come back for sure!! Mixed feelings here. Beef machaca was off the charts.  VERY VERY juicy and tasty!!  Jerk fried rice.  Wow. Fowl to say the least.  And the black bean purree stuff is uh... Very unusual.  I don't recommend it unless you eat it blindfolded.  Otherwise it feels like you you are cleaning up after your dog.  Once you've had it and read this it will make all the sense in the world.   The tables look like the came from a sale at Costco which is fine I suppose. A lot of chairs so that's good. Tv was way loud and above our table. All the other ones were too dirty to eat at.  So this review just sounds so negative.  I blame it on the black bean dog poo.  My wife had carnitas.  I tried that and it was ok.  Staff is very friendly and have no problem helping you with the insane order paper that they have you fill our yourself.  I am sure most of their food is off the charts.  Jade red chicken was delicious and very very spicy.  Idk.  Just watch out for the black bean dog poo.  It's not user friendly.  5 stars because that damn beef machaca! 

Almost forgot!!!! They give you a snicker doodle with your meal.  That's 5 stars too!!! Lol"}
{"text":"I have a feeling that this place will require more than one visit to really \"get\".  Once again, the experience of a restaurant vastly outweighs the food on it's own (in other words, takeout isn't as good as being here).

Mexican and Asian fusion?  Sure, I'll try anything at least once.  The concept may seem strange, but with what seems to be our cultural fixation low cost/high quantity food, I'm surprised this is the first time I'm seeing a blend like this.  And it turns out that it works pretty well.

If it's your first time going, make sure you tell them when you get to the front of the queue.  They will begin to regale you with no only an explanation of what in the world is going on, but will proceed to feed you half the menu so you can see what things taste like.

I, without fail, found the spiciest dish on the menu; the Chicken Diablo and had it burrito-ified.  That and a chilie relleno, with the surprisingly good black beans, sounded like a perfect combination.  When the food was brought out to the cafeteria-style dining area, it looked just as good as expected.  While the black beans were just as amazing as they were ten minutes ago when we were getting samples, the rest of the meal just didn't hold up to the excitement around the samples and the ordering experience.  The chicken was over-fried and was little more than crisp with a vaguely poultry-ish texture.  It might have been better served by not being crammed into a thin tortilla shell.  The relleno was, if not better, just more fun.  The constant battle between the cheese that leaks out after the first cut and the hot pepper inside, balanced against the cornflake breading that splinters anytime silverware comes near it...priceless.

It's certainly worth a visit.  The whole experience, from conception of the idea (\"Mexican and Chinese food? Say what?!?\") to the half meal you get as they rattle off their menu to you, is one that shouldn't be missed.  I can see why people like it so much, but maybe I need to go a few more times before it really catches me."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if Chino Bandido was a bit racist since it translates to Chinese Bandit, but it is so damn delicious I don't really care. The fusion restaurant steals flavors typically found in Americanized Chinese meals and combines them in bowls, burritos, and qusadillas. My favorites are the fiery Pollo Diablo, the savory Jade Red Chicken (similar to General Tso's), and the shiny Emerald Chicken. The jerk fried rice is addicting but its spicy peppers are not friendly on the tongue. I felt like I was robbing the place because of the huge portions at low prices. The meals also came with a snickerdoodle cookie."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My favorite is the jade chicken and jerk fried rice with a side of black beans.  They always throw in a fresh snickerdoodle cookie with your order too. Stop in and have a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My friend took my brothers and I here on a visit into town. I am very disappointed that I didn't know about this place while I lived there. The staff explained how to order and how it works and gave us samples. I ordered the jade chicken and a pollo Diablo quesadilla with black beans and jerk fried rice. I loved everything! I wish I would have gotten the emerald chicken instead of the pollo Diablo. I also tried the jerk chicken and it was great. It would be a good quesadilla! The snicker doodle cookies were amazing!
I can't wait to visit Phoenix again for chino bandidos!"}
{"text":"The theme definitely looks and sounds weird but it's a great tasting combo! Must get the carnitas! Super moist and flavorful! Jerk friend chicken was off the chain too! Beans have so much flavor as well! The only thing I didn't care for was the emerald chicken I ordered. Lacked flavor for sure. 

BUT I told the manager My taste buds didn't like it and he graciously changed it to jade chicken for me!! Awesome customer service here!! Peach green tea is super tasty. Man, guy hit this nail on the head!

Located in a run down looking old shopping center. Maybe the \"hood\" area in Glendale? But so good! Felt safe enough since 6 cops were eating inside too! Drinks have free refills as well. Seriously, try it!"}
{"text":"Proving you don't need fancy digs to pull off fusion cuisine, Chino Bandido combines Mexican and Chinese in a way that's not only good-tasting, but with a great sense of humor and an overwhelming eagerness to please.

My interaction didn't last long - just enough to order Pollo Diablo and some jerk chicken. Regardless of how incompatible those two items sound, it worked well, if only because both were crazy flavorful, and I sat there eating them out of a little tin with chopsticks. Cheap, good, and unique - it's all you need.

Apparently, you also need a snickerdoodle, because they gave me one for free. You win this round, Chino Bandido."}
{"text":"SAMPLES SAMPLES SAMPLES!

This place gives you a lot of samples that you feel that you can have it as a meal! :)  I am not complaining though......

Everything there is pretty good and very interesting. So it is a must try..

Just think Chinese food mixed with Mexican food... common' how can it get better than that?  Even though it might not sound good, it is pretty good.  It will make you come back.. trust me!

True definition of Asian Fusion..if you ask me."}
{"text":"My husband loves their food, but it is just okay to me. The inside doesn't look clean enough for me and they have long wait times. I still have no clue on their order system. But I am giving them 3 stars because their Jade chicken keeps my husband happy. We are from Chicago and haven't really found any food to die for yet, like back home."}
{"text":"I feel like a racist when I eat here.  Maybe it's the panda bear dressed as Pancho Villa.  Maybe it's the REST of the name (Chino Bandido Takee-Outee).  Maybe it's the fact that I giggled when I saw both.  I don't know.  I just feel bad about it.

That said, the food is actually pretty good.  It certainly won't blow your mind, but getting a Chinese chicken dish with Spanish rice is an experience to savor.  The snickerdoodle is cool, too.  One big drawback?  An incomparably confusing ordering system that leaves even Mensa minds with a headache.  

For better or worse, this is a restaurant that has never heard the word, \"no.\""}
{"text":"Saw it on diner drive in and dives,  it's a dive but a good one.  staff helpful when ordering for the first time.  Should have tried the emerald chicken ,  I got the jade chicken, the black beans were very good and the jerk fried rice was tasty. I even got a cookie with my combo.  The carnitas was average I've had better.  I would go back to eat there again."}
{"text":"WOW! Asian Mexican restaurant. ..who would have ever thought of this? Well it is what it is and it's ok. . Had the Jerk chicken and something else for a reasonable price. ..nothing to write home about that's for sure. .. you get to choose Asian or Mexican dishes and even combine them if you wish but for all is worth it ain't much to get excited over. .. just another hole in the wall place hasn't been remodeled since the day they opened I guess"}
{"text":"Awesome food,friendly staff, good beer and kid friendly!! Red jade chicken blew my socks off!!! I will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chino Bandidos since the 90s when I lived in Phoenix as a wee little child. After moving away, I relished the rare chance of visiting and eating their delicious food and walking away with a snicker doodle cookie to wash it all down. They have too many good choices of food, though I generally get a jerk-chicken quesadilla and trade between the gringo chicken in a burrito, or the emerald chicken, or the jade red chicken. The jerk fried rice is phenomenal. Their black beans have a twist to them. Spend $10 on a meal and you've got more flavor than most Mexican food and Chinese food can match. Highly recommended. 

I always send friends here and they are never disappointed either."}
{"text":"Saw this a while back on the show DDD and saw the reviews on yelp so finally took the plunge and went on my first yelp trip. First off...the area is a little scary. I'm not one of \"those\" girls. I lived in downtown LA right next to the garment district...took the subway to work in hollywood in the middle of the night. Anyways maybe I just went at a bad time where a bunch of ppl hung out outside. I go inside and grab the order form. The people there were really nice and helped me fill it out and was patient enough to help my man over my cell phone. He is such a baby doesn't like to try new things. I swear its all burgers and chicken strips. Anyways I got the bbq pork 'dilla and emerald chicken with black beans and chicken FR. He got the jerk chicken burrito and chicken diablo with jerk FR and black  beans. Everything was good, even got him to try mine which is a miracle itself. The cookies were to die for...diamond in the rough for sure. Next time though, he is going to go pick it up."}
{"text":"I really felt like I had gotten Punk'd by all the wonderful yelp reviewers. One thing I learned from my Arizona trip is that you guys are deprived of really good food and because you don't have any you mistake horrible food for something praiseworthy. It doesn't even matter what I ordered, all my friends and I got something different and each person's dish was not appetizing. If you are an out of towner, I would skip this spot.. it's more for the local's taste buds."}
{"text":"Nothing to see here folks. Such a disappointment to see this joint trying to wrap orange chicken in a tortilla. Jerk rice, boo. I'll give it to them though, I did feel like a JERK for buying their food. Never again. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Such an amazing combination of foods. The Mexican and Asian styles together makes everything taste even more amazing. When you walk inside it's not that fancy but don't let that deter you. The service is quick and they will bring the food to your table. They also have alcohol available. I do wish it was easier to order. Filling out a piece of paper seems out of place compared to other restaurants.

The employees are always helpful. They will fill you in on the menu if you have any questions. If you come for the first time you may have a few.

There is lots of parking in the little strip mall area. You can always park right out front.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone. It's such a unique take on two different cultures Food that just works."}
{"text":"This just maybe the most interesting place I have ever encountered, crazy combo of Mexican meets Chinese food. I first was skeptical of this idea .. but I love both so I was open to it.. well I was amazed.  Never thought I would have rice and beans with Korean pork.. or chicken fried rice with Machaca beef..  they have almost unlimited  options. I've visited this place three times now in the last couple months.. nice simple nothing fancy inside just  good service and very reasonable prices.  It's a fun place to take a freind , great to see them enjoy something out ordinary. Give it a shot I'm thinking you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this spot, my go to roadtrip pit stop destination!!"}
{"text":"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? 

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

But the food was way way too \"greasy.\" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there...."}
{"text":"OK, so it took to trips to this place for me to become a fan... but now I am most def. a fan. they have cold beer and good food."}
{"text":"The food is very good i just don't like eating out of a dog dish. The dinning experience is also lacking charm. Good location always busy best for take out."}
{"text":"\"Mexican / Asian Fusion\" -- sounds like a night filled with heartburn and the next day filled with running to the bathroom.

But it actually works. The food is really good. You need a secret decoder ring to figure out how to place an order as there must be 3,214,982 different possible combinations. The staff is friendly and helpful though.

Maybe it's my fault, or my decoder ring is malfunctioning, but almost every time I've ordered, something has been wrong. They always graciously taken it back and fix it though.

Personally, I could get by with just a giant bowl of jerk fried rice and a plate of snickerdoodles."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from TV on an episode of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives. After seeing the episode and seeing how close I was to the location I was eager to stop by and try this hole in the wall gem. 

Walking in first timers may feel a little intimidated but the employees will walk you through how to order and they even have an option to taste test the menu items. 

I usually order a combo with jerk chicken, jade red chicken quesadilla, pork fried rice, and refried beans. The portion size is more than enough and I always have left overs. Their hot sauce is amazing I always order extra. 

I have always had a positive experience with all the employees. They are fast, and friendly."}
{"text":"Close your eyes. Now imagine a dish that's equal parts Chinese and Mexican with a bit of Caribbean jerk thrown in...got it? Probably not, because these flavors seem like they would be the craziest of combinations. Well, over at Chino Bandido they have done just that, and very successfully might I add. 
This is not a first visit review- I have been stopping into Chino's for lunches for about four years now so this is more of a collective critique. Even though the menu consists of pictures and explanations it can still be a little daunting to a first timer so don't be afraid to let the cashier know that you are on your maiden voyage, they will walk you through the basics and even have you taste a few things so you don't get in over your head spice-wise. Aside from a variety of items on the menu, anything can be served \"as is\", as a burrito, or quesadilla and they come with your choice of beans (Jamaican style black or chorro) and rice (chicken, pork, jerk or white) so needless to say the combinations are endless. Touching on all items would make for way longer of a review than anyone would ever read so I'll just hit a few of my fav's. First off is the Jade red chicken- this is the house favorite and one of mine as well, think Mexican version of sweet and sour chicken but better. Jerk chicken- now beware, this flavorful version packs a deceiving punch but its worth it if you're a jerk fan. The emerald chicken is a surprisingly fresh green onion and ginger dish that seems to be on the lighter side of the mostly dense menu. There are also the chicken or pork carnitas which always seem to be extremely juicy and work great in a quesadilla or solo. No desert necessary every dish comes with a fresh made snickerdoodle. The staff is always as friendly as can be and I'm not sure you can find a larger portion for your buck. For the freshest go during prime lunch or dinner hours as I've found they sometimes let items sit a bit through the off peak."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember.

I'll always remember lunch at Chino Bandido. I got the carnitas burrito, you got the Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla. We shared a fountain drink with no ice. The whole experience was really nice.

Then we stood at your car door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it."}
{"text":"So today this chino finally met the Bandido, and it sure was good! My first time here so i got to try some samples of different concoctions of asian/mexican food to see what i would like. Now if you're looking for good chinese food this isnt the place, and if you're looking for good mexican food this isnt the place. This place was meant for the fusion of both together to create a new style of food. For example i had the emerald chicken, which was pan fried or steamed chicken breast with the green onion ginger sauce they put on chinese steamed chicken, it was ok i probably wont get it again because it was just something i could make at home, but then i had the roasted pork in a burrito, now if you know how the red chinese roast pork taste like try to picture this in your mind, the sweetness of the sauce that marinades the meat with the chewyness of the best kind of tortilla, the chewy soft not dry kind. And the flavor of the flour tortilla all topped with some salsa which i think they use sweet chili sauce, im not sure but it was dang good. But thats not all i got the pork fried rice underneath which was weird yet savory at the same time, the way they season the fried rice makes it taste different and unique. The plate i had also came with a side of black beans which were pretty amazing as well. I am by no means a bean liking person, however these beans were so good i had to eat em, they had a savoryness with some spice, almost like they made it with a little soy sauce and chili. Last but not least the sugar cookie, it tasted homemade and was soft, and chewy. Overall i think it depends on the person, it could be a hit or miss with this place because the flavors are so unique and different. Theres one thing for sure though, if you get the two item plate you will be stuffed, i was so full afterward i felt like i didn't need a dinner, but that didn't stop me from eating one anyways! ;)"}
{"text":"The emerald chicken is fantastic.  The sweet roasted pork had real depth of flavor.   And the service was GREAT.  Worth another visit.."}
{"text":"To say I don't get the appeal of Chino Bandido would be an understatement.

I don't really need to say anything about this place...just look at the picture above! That's what the food looks like!  Need I really say more?

Well, I'm going to:

OK, so they serve both Mexican and Chinese food. SO WHAT? It's not even like they serve a hybrid of Mexican and Chinese food. You know, if they served Kung Pao enchiladas, that might be interesting, but this is just Chinese food and Mexican food next to eachother in the same aluminum takeout bowl (yes, even if you'e not taking out). Oh, and by the way, did I mention it's SHITTY Chinese and Mexican food. 

That being said, if you love Panda Express, you might like the Chinese food at Chino Bandido. If you like super-over-fried, heartburn-enducing flavorless cardboard, you might like their Mexican food. And If you like using plastic silverware to try and cut through said cardboard as it sits in said aluminum take-out bowl while countless shirtless 10-year-olds drool over every dirty inch of your favorite restaurant, then this might just be your favorite restaurant.

On the plus side, they give you a free cookie."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this location, the service here, or the food. It  just tasted different. Too bad because this one is a lot closer to home."}
{"text":"We heard good things and previous reviews on Yelp indicated great things.  Let's get to the point.  This restaurant is anything but good.  The atmosphere is best aligned to a church hall on a Saturday night for a spaghetti dinner fund raiser.  Folding tables, stark decor and sticky floor.  Boy, I can't wait to come back.

The food was described as Asian / Mexican Fusion.  Not even close.  You have to give them credit that they do try but fall way short.  I had the jerk chicken with jerk fried rice, plus \"black beans\".  The jerk chicken was OK, but nothing great and how does jerk chicken align with Mexican or Asian?  The jerk rice was over cooked and the black beans . . . . well, they would have been better for wall paste.  The consistency was gooey and tasteless.

The owners should consider taking some time refining their offerings, and improving their decor and seating area."}
{"text":"So far I've had their red jade chicken, emerald ginger chicken, pollo diablo, and egg foo yung. I enjoyed all the chicken dishes, but for me the emerald ginger chicken really stands out - very flavorful and the most Asian-tasting of what I've tried here. The egg foo yung is OK but I think I will skip that in my future visits. All the entrees go pretty well with the rice and beans that came the meals. Not spectacular fare but inexpensive, fast, flavorful, and filling - all that will draw me back for future visits, definitely."}
{"text":"You gonna check out the Chino \"flavor town,\" pork burrito is \"dynamite,\" the combo platter is seriously THE \"bad boy,\" and the cookies -- \"oh my!\" This place is everything Guy Fieri said it is and more. My favorite comfort food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It's a fusion of chinese and mexican food and it is really great food!  The place is very popular, so there is no good time to go, you will always stand in line.  They are quick with getting your food out, though.  The tortillas are handmade and you can't go in without ordering their homemade cookies.  This place has been around forever, and I highly recommend trying it out.  Fun place!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here period. 
They have the best selection for meat eaters, and chicken,  as well as steamed veggies for those that would like more of a healthy side. 

The emerald chicken is my all time favorite,  and I choose it with a different entre. This time I am having Diablo chicken. 
It always comes with a snickerdoodle too. 

The place is very trendy. 
Serve your own drinks and silverware. 
Open and bright. 

Clean restrooms and great servers. 

Must try for guests visiting town, totally great for regulars."}
{"text":"This is a crazy combination and it really works! Chinese, Mexican and some Caribbean. What I find odd is that with food from 3 different \"brown\" cultures, the majority on the patrons were white! Just an observation. Kinda hectic in the Phoenix location, it reminds me of a busy toy store during Christmas shopping season. Dont let that scare you off it's really good, The  Red Jade Chicken is my favorite! they are or have opened a new location in Chandler, so for east valley folks, that's nice."}
{"text":"Every time I get food from here it's completely disgusting. Their little banditos are good but that's it."}
{"text":"I have never ever heard of this place until two days ago. After a google search and menu perusal I got excited!! Went to dinner tonight and I was not disappointed in the slightest. The restaurant is basic; meaning the focus is on the food not the decor. It's actually refreshing to be in such a laid back casual atmosphere. It allows the food to shine. Bathrooms were spotless which is +++ in my boom. Jerk chicken is totes amazeballs also the Cuban beans. Next time I go I am going to try the veggie quesadilla. I saw that being served at the next table and it gave me entree envy. So just GO!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and my son after seeing it on Guy's show, and wanting to try something that sounded so far removed from wheat grass and couscous (my girlfriend acquiesced). I reviewed the ordering process thoroughly, so as not to embarrass myself, or hold up the line, and I was able to coach up my group on how to order. There was no line (a slow Thursday night), and it was a little tricky to find (especially at night), but it's not too hidden. I had the machaca burrito (very good), jade red chicken (better than average, but I couldn't believe how small a portion they gave me - even my girlfriend thought it was objectionably small (doh!), but I was in a good mood and didn't complain), the black beans (a little sweet, but good), and jerk rice (good, but they let it dry out...I'm sure if it'd been fresher it would've been better). They both had chile relleno (I tried some - awesome), and I don't remember what else. My son ate almost all the snickerdoodles, with no complaints (my girlfriend's a baking pro, so her standards are high for cookies, and she was underwhelmed with her bite).   If they get the quality control worked out, they'll merit another star from me."}
{"text":"My friends raved about this place and finally took me recently and I could not have been more disappointed.  The service was horrendous and slow.  I could have walked to either China or Mexico before I got my food.  The Diablo Chicken was dry and uninspired and the rice and beans were medicore at best.  Not sure what all the fan fare is about this place but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I'll start by listing what I ate: Pork Fried Rice with Black Beans, Machaca and a Quesadilla with Jade Red Chicken.

I have to admit that it was the Guy Fieri DD&D feature that drew me to this place -- and I am glad that I went! The staff are friendly and invite you to sample their menu items, they provide recommendations and they help you come up with your order. I was skeptical about the encouragement that I try their black beans, but I was glad that I did. I normally do not like black beans, but whatever they do to them here makes them pretty good.

I was also skeptical about the \"fusion\" element to their menu -- but needlessly so. The Jade Red Chicken works well in a quesadilla, and (probably most surprising for me), the Pork Fried Rice went well with the black beans AND the machaca.

This is definitely a casual dining experience, and the culinary category here is definitely comfort food. You'll walk away with either leftovers for later consumption or a very full stomach -- for me, it was the latter :)"}
{"text":"This place was really good! It was a little bit crazy though because they mixed two different types of foods. I had a orange chicken quesadilla... but it was awesome!  I would def go back, but I will order less. The portions are huge ha ha."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Vegas and my husband found this place on the web. So we decided to try it out. I had the red chicken/chile relleno with jerk fried rice and black beans. My husband had the jerk chicken and burrito combo with black beans. Kids had teriyaki chicken/quesadilla. Overall food was just blah. Nothing exciting to say!  Was disappointed actually! The place was dirty and out dated. From the reviews on Yelp I still don't get what's the big hype.  The people that eat this food probably don't know what's the meaning of \"good food\" sorry but not sorry!"}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure, you are calling my name.  

Every now and then I will drive out of my way to eat at Chino Bandido. It's kind of sad actually.  On a night when I'm alone and taking a much needed break from going out with friends, I will order up a ridiculous meal of fried rice, Cuban black beans, and jade red chicken in a quesidilla. Then, I will sit down with my friend the DVR and watch bad TV. Basically, I do two things that are embarrassing to do with others: watch horrible TV and eat horribly unhealthy food. Sometimes, I actually let a friend join me and after the taste explosion in our mouths has worn off we are left grabbing our stomachs and moaning in pain, \"I am never eating this again.\" 

When you eat a meal at Chino's, just know that you are done. You will not be doing anything else for the rest of the day/night, you will not go dancing, you will not go on a bike ride, and you will not be having any sex. You will just sit there until your stomach digests all the contents of that round metal container they cram everything into. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I absolutely always enjoy the jade red chicken.  A little disappointed they do not have egg rolls but the heat selection of Asian beers definitely make up for it"}
{"text":"Usually excellent, today the service was poor - someone hates their job or maybe having a bad day. The portion of carnitas was minuscule. I have understood the price increases, but to reduce the portions to a tablespoon of carnitas is just bad for business."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and let me tell ya it's Beyond yummy highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  I love this place!  I've been eating here as a regular since the 90s.  Never had a bad plate.  Don't miss their other location in if you are on the East side!"}
{"text":"I was totally surprised by this place. 

It's in the middle of a run-down strip mall and it's not a whole lot to look at. 

I was in the area for lunch and my photographer suggested we go here. He said \"you gotta try the Jade Red Chicken.\" I'm always up for something a little different. So when he said t's an Asian-Mexican fusion type of place, I was curious. 

Inside, the decor is very weird looking. But it's been my experience that places that aren't too fancy looking often have the best food. 

I go up to the counter and I was surprised they look you sample some of the dishes. I knew I was going to order the Jade Red Chicken, but I wanted to give it a whirl first. I was blown away! The jerk fried rice was also freaking good! To top it off, they give you a moist snicker doodle cookie?!

I am totally going to go out of my way to come here again. The next thing I've been told I need to try is the Jade Red Chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited this place but it left a definite impression on me. Now weather it was a good one or bad one, I have not decided yet! This is their second location and boy did it impress. This mega large laboratory as I see it allows the cooks in the back to mix up all kinds of Mexican/chinese combos all for your feasting pleasure. 

My trip to this place resulted from a mini maraton of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Being that I am a Arizona native and big man who loves to eat I decided to give this place a shot. After all how many places other than a buffet can you get different types of cuisine all on one plate? Not many.  From the moment I walked in I was greeted and offered a tour of all the different items and ways they could be combined. I swear it felt like I was taking a test LOL. 

(OK you said I can get the spicy chicken made into what now?) I mean honestly if it is necessary for you to spend over 12 minutes explaining how to order food from your restaurant you may want to think about changing a few things around. But after taking the time to study I felt I was ready for my final exam, time to order. 

OK let me say that for those who expect this place to turn out real homemade Mexican food, they will be disappointed. What they do offer is the chance to try things in new and different ways. Are they all a success? No! But with so many choices, an empty belly and a sense of culinary adventure I am sure you will want to try this place at least once in your life time. Who knows you may like a jerk chicken burrito or a jade chicken quesadilla but for me I will stick with the local takeout Chinese food joint. Why because when it comes to food you should not have to choose between simple and good, it should be simply good period. Case closed, class dismissed."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people really love this place but....I just don't get the hype.

The food is ok - I should say the meat they give you is tasty but they give you so little and 3/4 of it is the rice.  Come on!  If you are going to charge me almost $10 can you spare a bit more meat??   The jerk rice was plain tasting.  I had to add hot sauce to get a kick and the teryaki chicken was....Terrible.  I mean I could have had better at Panda and I HATE Panda!

I just can't see myself going back there for black beans, ok rice and a tablespoon of meat."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of my go to spits! Absolutely love it!!! I will recommend it to everyone I know. It's a must try for sure."}
{"text":"I would also give this place 3.5 stars.  I think they could improve the quality of the food some but it's tasty and different then anywhere else, it's a one-of-a-kind restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay so don't be scared when you pull into the shopping plaza that houses Chino Bandido.  The area seems a little sketch, and the restaurant itself looked sketch, but you'll be making a big mistake if you leave!  You don't want to miss out on the good food!

Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly guy that offered both me and my sister quite a tasting of all their offerings.  I tried everything from their famous jade chicken to the black beans lol.  I think it is important to mention, I was already full from lunch, but even still the food tasted awesome.  I bought a combo with two portions of the jade chicken (which is something like caramelized general tso's) and paired it with their jerk chicken fried rice.  The jade chicken is good, but that jerk chicken fried rice is stellar!!  It actually had a good amount of spice, and just loaded with flavor.  It was probably laden with msg, but I don't really care.  

If i remember correctly, if you order two portions of something like jade chicken, you can make one of the portions into a cheese quesadilla version free of charge!  Really superb, and the free fresh baked cookies that come with the order are just icing on the cake!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Decor-simple
Staff-wonderful
Food: Jerk Chicken, delightful; Carnitas, good; jerk fried rice, yummy

Will be back, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that."}
{"text":"Ok, just tried this place since all my friends raved about it. It was really, really, really Good! !! Loved the Jen red pork, Jade red chicken and fried rice. Tjey have fast and friendly service. Prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but there was absolutely nothing special about this place, the food was alright, the atmosphere was fine. The kids food portion was super small, the rice was seriously lacking flavor and the chicken was plain with sauce poured over it. We also ordered the veggie quesadilla... that was iceberg lettuce and tomatoes in a fried tortilla, I think it may have had some cheese too. The kids loved the beans though, so that is good."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places...  Though I would suggest coming in during lunch (11a-1p) during the week, or for dinner (5p-7p) on Fridays... the food is mostly batch prepped, and best during those hours.

The location off of 19th Avenue and Greenway tends to be better if you are in that area.

I tend to order a combo with Carnitas Quesadilla, Hen Grenade Chicken, pork fried rice, and pinto beans... ymmv of course...  I've had most of the menu, but it's been a while since I've ordered anything else.. I come in about once a month lately either here or at the 19th ave location."}
{"text":"One of a kind place right here - think fusion of Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican.  The Jade Red Chicken is my personal favorite and their most popular dish.  Jerk fried rice is great and the meal comes with the cookie of the day (which are surprisingly pretty good).  Doesn't look like much from the outside (or the inside to be honest), but this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"My taste buds are still recovering after my experience eating here. I'm angry at myself for not checking this place out sooner. Now that I have, you bet I'll be dragging my friends out here to try it. 

First off, if it's your first time, they give you samples of pretty much everything. I think this is awesome, especially if you haven't tried anything there before.

The jerk chicken immediately was my favorite. The chicken was moist and it was spiced perfectly. The jade red chicken was also delicious as well.

You can make a combo with your choice of two meats (alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla), rice, and beans for like $9. The portions are huge and you definitely won't leave hungry.

I got the chicken fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken in a quesadilla, and the jade red chicken alone. I couldn't finish much of the rice and beans because I was so full from the delicious chicken. I'm salivating just thinking about it.

The location is in a weird spot. If you don't know what you are looking for, it can be really easy to miss.

I highly recommend checking this place out. I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of the more unique culinary concepts I have ever encountered -  a brash fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisines. And wow, is it ever tasty!
So we were watching the TripleD show on Food Network and Chino Bandido was featured - the moment we were aware that this place was within driving distance, we hopped in the car and headed there; may have arrived before the show even ended! From what I saw, I just had to try it out; and now we have a new favourite eatery.
First the negative - why I can't give a full 5 stars. The interior of the restaurant blends well with the ghetto neighbourhood - the place is a filthy dive! While I typically enjoy most dives, my only real gripe was that the tables were so unclean that I had to make a place-mat with the paper napkins so that my cutlery would touch a clean surface. The interior definitely activated my OCD. I wouldn't be surprised if some first-timers simply walked out after looking around the dining area - it has the pleasantness of a prison lunchroom. I will say that one aspect I liked was that the condiment/cutlery station included chopsticks and Chinese mustard. A big plus for me. 
But...once you taste the food, the concerns of the divey interior are washed away with gastronomical gratification.
The ordering process can seem daunting at first - they have a sheet you fill out and it can get quite complicated. Basically they offer two sizes of \"rice bowls\" - which is basically a bowl that they fill with:  different types of fried rice, two types of Mexican beans, and your choice of entree meat. I believe they have about 15 different entree selections, from chicken to pork to beef and some are Chinese (like Emerald Chicken) and some are Mexican (like Beef Machaca). The larger combination bowl allows you to select 2 different entree items for $8. You can just get everything in a bowl, or you can make it either a burrito or quesadilla (they have their own tortilla recipe!), or combine it within the rice bowl itself. Sounds complicated, but once you try it it will seem simple the next time you go,
My wife got: plain rice in a bowl with black beans, Jen Red Pork, and Chile Relleno. She said that it may just be the best chile relleno she has ever had! We both definitely recommend the black beans over the refried beans.
I got:  Pork Fried Rice bowl, with refried beans, a Chinese BBQ Pork burrito, and also the Jen Red Pork.  The pork fried rice was great - they do great things with pork there. Again, I would recommend the black beans over the refried beans. The Chinese BBQ Pork tasted good, but it was bit too fatty - but wrapped in a tortilla as a burrito, it was still pretty darn fantastic. And then the Jen Red Pork - wow! so good. Perfectly crispy and bite-sized for chopstick use, with just the right amount of heat behind it. I absolutely loved it, and would order it again and again. Word on the street is that the Jade Red Chicken is the most popular item - will definitely have to try that one next time, and also perhaps try one of their quesadillas. 
On a sad note - I am disappointed that they don't offer egg rolls and tacos! 
So 5 stars for the food - loved the pork fried rice, the black beans, the Jen Red pork, and the tortillas. SO YUMMY. 
Decent value also - for $8 you get a good portion of food. Not enough to take any home after, but enough to satisfy and get your $8 worth. 
I am tempted to ignore the restaurant conditions and just give 5 stars for the food, but I don't think that's fair to a reader who is looking for a nice sit-down meal - you must be willing to accept the slightly ghetto conditions. But the food is worth it. What a terrific concept and the execution equally matches the idea."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better!!!   The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies....oh my goodness.   Every time I'm in phoenix, this is my must go see do eat spot!!  The owner Frank is awesome."}
{"text":"I feel like i'm the only person who didn't like this place.

My sister is a huge fan and went with me to order.  I had the Jade Chicken.

Bleh.   I tasted her food too but I don't recall what it was--still bleh.

I'll stick with the 'berto brothers for my bad mexican food.  

Maybe I just don't like asian food?"}
{"text":"My arteries hate this place, but fortunately they don't get to make decisions.

So many things to love:
1) you can sample their signature dishes
2) combo options- 2 item + side or 1 item + side
3) Carnitas and jade red chicken
4) COOKIES- the volcano, a chocolate fudge snickerdoodle
5) kitschy interior with blatantly racist decor (a giant panda with a sombrero)
6) no frills, hole-in-the-wall vibe

If the most delicious hole-in-the-wall taqueria and your favorite Chinese take-out spot had a baby, it would be a fat sombrero-wearing Panda named Chino Bandido."}
{"text":"Interesting Chinese/Mexican hybrid. The food was good. They have a unique presentation.  You get a lot of food for a cheap price. This is a good place for take-out. One staff member was a little rude, like he was shocked I had a few questions.  The rest of the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"One of my wifes favorites.  I liked the chioce of Mexican and Chinese.  If you have a chance check it out."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. Chinese and Mexican fusion is genius and delicious! I got the combo bowl with red jade chicken, BBQ pork, pork fried rice, and black beans. This was my first time here and I loved it. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just try it, it's delicious. The ordering process is daunting for me, but I'm not always the sharpest tool in the shed. You just write what you want on a piece of paper, but there is some circling involved. The food is so tasty, and you will not taste anything like it anywhere else in Phoenix. I always want to get something different, but fate leads me back to the Jade Red chicken with Rice and Black beans. And you get a free snickerdoodle. Do not believe people that say it's not clean in Chino either. It might be hold in the wall like, though it's actually quite large inside, it's very clean."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Absolutely delicious! It's a little hole in the wall but packed because it's so delicious! 

They allow you to taste test before deciding, unfortunately it didn't help because everything tastes amazing! I had the carnitas and jerk chicken fried rice. They also add a nice touch with a warm soft snickerdoodle cookie!  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's logo says it all: racist, stereotypical, and fails to represent the Chinese and Latino food cultures completely. I brought my best friend who was visiting for the holiday, to this restaurant, having seen the segment featured on DDD.
We drove about a half hour to get to the restaurant so by the time we got there we were hungry! The ordering technique was unique and after someone explained it to us and let us sample the beans and meat varieties, we grew excited to eat the food that seemed so delicious. 

But then the food came...

First off, I ordered the chili relleno, plain fried rice, and egg foo yun.
My friend ordered a carnitas burrito, chicken fried rice, and the quesadilla with the pollo diablo. 

The chile relleno I received was basically a skinny tasteless chile with gobs of cheddar cheese inside of a large battered shell. And it looked like a big fried snake. To me, cheese is cheating. When you throw cheese on food, of course it's going to taste good but cheese can only go so far. I didn't pay to eat fried, greasy, batter. I paid to eat a hot chile with cheese stuffed inside an egg coating. And the Egg Foo Yun? Um...basically bean sprouts with green onion and egg filtered throughout like a bean sprout scramble. 
Plain fried rice was bland and almost tasteless. The best part of the dish was the refried black beans. 

My friend enjoyed her burrito with carnitas the most along with the beans but mentioned that Cuban beans are normally not sweet the way they were made in this restaurant. \"Cuban beans\" ha! I guess if you've never really had Cuban food you would never know the difference and think this was the best combination of Chinese and Latino food you've ever tasted. 

But anyway, this food was not at all what I expected. I don't know what's wrong with Guy Fieri for praising this restaurant. I guess any restaurant could write to the Food Network to get on DDD and they would run it. 
Do people not have taste buds or a palette that is able to distinguish shit from dirt?

I get it, you're hungry. But damn. I wasn't that hungry. I was very tempted to return the food and say, you know? I just can't do it. But we drove for thirty minutes to get there, and my friend was visiting and we had talked about going to this place for a day and a half, so we had to do it. We had to at least eat the food. But man, I just don't get why people could rave about food that's tasteless, greasy, and unauthentic. Sorry, Chino Bandido. Your food is nasty. But your cookie was okay."}
{"text":"This local famous restaurant is a fun place to eat for lunch.  Everytime I come to Phoenix I have to complete my trip by eating there.  Their chinese-mexican mixed foods are tasty.  The line is always there but the foods are served fast.  I always want to try different combo but end up eating Emerald Chicken and Jerk Chicken because they are that yummy.

While you are there check out their chinese proverbs T-shirt."}
{"text":"It was just Nasty!!!
If you have no tastes buds then you might like it.
I'm new to Phoenix and took a friend there for a quick bite. He ordered the egg foo yong which was cold. 
Needless to say I was embarrassed for myself and for the restaurant.
People say Oh they're great because they were on TV. 
Yeah Diners, Drive Ins and DIVES."}
{"text":"Jerk fried rice was excellent. Average Jen red pork. I didn't care for the carnitas at all.  AZ Cardinals on the flat screen which was good!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago at a job I worked, someone sent an email saying for so-and-so's birthday we were going to go to Chino Bandido for lunch. Immediately my inbox was filled with replies of \"Oh Yeah!!!\" and \"Count me in\" and \"I'll be there.\" This was the first time I had ever seen EVERYONE in that office agree on a place to eat AND with much replied enthusiasm. Something was up. 

On the date of our lunch outing, we all piled into cars and drove to the other side of town, from the East Valley to the West. That is how much people loved this place. It was no longer a lunch date, it was now a field trip. (There is also a location in Chandler, but everyone in the office seems partial to the original location.) 

Located in an unassuming strip mall, you immediately get the hole-in-the-wall feeling right away. First time visitors can sample the eight most popular dishes and usually the story of how the restaurant came to be. Allowing you to sample the food first, helps you make a more informed decision for what to order. What a novel concept! Figuring out the ordering menu can be a little tricky, however the staff, mostly children and grandchildren of the owners, are happy to help you. 

Chino Bandido takes Caribbean, Mexican and Oriental flavors and throws them all together, creating some truly unique, tasty food. You can choose between a rice bowl or a combination for two meats with rice and beans. If you want something mild, try the Carnitas, Gringo Chicken or Emerald Chicken. If you like something spicier, the Jerk Chicken is up your alley. The Cuban Black Beans are a must and the Jerk Fried Rice has a definite kick. When ordering a combination, you have have choose to have the meat with a tortilla. Personally, I like having a Jade Red Chicken burrito and an Emerald Chicken quesadilla. Very tasty. Plus the best part -- at least for me because I love them -- your meal comes with a yummy Snickerdoodle cookie."}
{"text":"I am finally getting around to writing a review about thsi place even though i was there months ago.  This place is mind blowing!  

You dont come here for the atmosphere but rather the amazing food and the crazy blend of mexican and asian flavors.

I know mexican/asian flavor? Insane but it works.

They even give you a cookie for dessert."}
{"text":"If you mind eating at a six person plastic resin table in a non-descript quasi-strip mall, please keep driving, McDonalds is just up 19th a little more.  However, if you want to taste some of the best black beans in the world coupled with some incredible Jerk Fried Rice to match beautifully with tastylicious Jade Red Chicken- this is the place!  Chinese-Mexican takee-outee is one of Phoenix's best food combinations in Chino Bandito.  Fun staff, great food, and a line out the door keeps the masses coming back.  I think it's hilarious the amount of money this place must absolutly rack in yet they refuse to spend one cent on ambiance or to fix the place up (I bet if I did the research, they probably own the whole shopping complex).  It is what it is and if you didn't see the line out the door, which by the way, by the time it gets there it's already 30 ft long, you'd never stop-but you need to and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I was turned on to Chino Bandido through a friend who lives near the Chandler location. When he said it was Mexican/Chinese fusion, I was initially taken aback. The concept just didn't sound appealing at all. He assured me the food was great. He was right and Chinos is always on the list of places to eat when I am in the Phoenix area. I hadn't seen the Triple D episode so I had no idea what to expect. 

What amazes me is how diverse the menu is. So many meat, bean and rice choices, along with how you want the meat served. By itself, in a burrito or a quesadilla. The Pollo Diablo is my favorite, the only thing I would do to change it would be to make it spicier but I am probably the exception there. The Jerk Chicken is really good too. All the difference rice choices are excellent as are the beans. The snickerdoodle cookie is a nice touch. 

The ordering process is pretty easy once the counter people have explained it, and the offering of samples makes it easy to decide if you've never been there. The dining room is nothing fancy, just long communal benches, but it makes finding a seat easier during busy periods. Food comes out pretty quick too."}
{"text":"Food is good but not really my favorite and it's different from other places I've tried. Wasn't too impressed. Hey at least I tried it and no what I like and don't like."}
{"text":"Wow this place rocks. Fast casual. Fill out a form to order lots of combinations possible.  I had the Relleno jerk chicken fried rice retried beans and their had chicken.  Delicious and cool variety.  Found out about this place from a coworker if I lived locally I'd eat here weekly."}
{"text":"I just can't help but love a place so unique.  And what is unique, if not a place you can get jerk chicken, refried beans, and pork fried rice all sharing the same humble pie tin?

This has become the spot I need to return to every time I visit my family out West (my family is more than happy to oblige).  The jerk chicken is my absolute favorite, mainly because where am I gonna go in Michigan to get Caribbean food?  (Answer: Nowhere) Apart from that, I had things here I've never even heard of!  Special mention for the emerald chicken, which is one of the few dishes involving meat that I can honestly describe as tasting \"fresh\".

Only about nine more months and I'll be back in line, order sheet in hand."}
{"text":"I hadn't visited this place in about five years. Once again, I really enjoyed everything tasted at this restaurant.  The fare is a fusion of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican flavors. First, I was offered samples of all the major items to try.  I selected  the Jade Red chicken, the black beens with cumin, and the Jerk Chicken (been to Jamaica, ate their jerk chicken while there, Chino Bandidio's was pretty darn good) - all were packed with flavor and delicious.The staffing was helpful, friendly and attentive - I couldn't as for more. 

I'll be back to try some of the other menu items. I'll definitely refer this establishment to others."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept!  You would never think Chinese and Mexican food don't go well together, but man... wait till you try sweet and sour chicken burrito... or  pork fried rice with re-fried beans.... it's legit!   The pork fried rice is also very addictive,  the food is actually not too oily... I was very afraid my food would tastes super oily and contains a ton of MSG.  

This is a very unique experience, don't expect authentic Mexican or Chinese food... but definitely worth a try!  The pork jerk fried rice is my favorite!  it has a kick!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty.   Its a fusion of mexican, Asian, and Jamaican.   The restaurant decor isn't that great but the price is right for all the food you get.  I think the system for odering could be improved.   By some type of number system.   Yelling your name out loud in a group of people is ghetto.  I really don't  want strangers knowing my name."}
{"text":"We go to the original location 15414 N.19th Ave, a lot. I thought we would give the new location 1825 W. Chandler Blvd, a try for the most part the food was as good.

Service on the other hand was more then lacking. Nothing like the original location, 8 employees and felt like none wanted to take the order or help/answer questions about the menu.

One of the employees was more interested in the cookie she was eating while bagging the others for customers then waiting on anyone. Another coming out in to the dining room to eat and still wearing his gloves he used to serve food in the kitchen then back into the kitchen without changing the gloves.

General cleanliness also lacking, dirty vents and pipes over head, leaking air vent over soda area.

In the future we will be going back to the original location."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you hear about and not sure if you should try it or not. If you get a chance DO IT!  We have been eating here when we are in the area for the last 10 Years and never been disappointed. The place is very low key, staff is good, dining area can get a little messy during busy times but they stay on top of it. 
Our order: 
Diablo Pork, Jade red chicken  & Jerk chicken, Jade red chicken  both W/refried beans. Dinners come with snicker doodle cookies for dessert. Not to expensive $$"}
{"text":"O.... M..... G....

This place is so awesome I can't even get valley girl enough!  Had this place not been on Triple D I would have never stepped foot in this place.  But this is NOT like those fast food joints that sell donuts, chinese food, and fried chicken.  Not even close.  This place is so good!!!!

It's not healthy- but who cares!  I love getting the teriyaki chicken in a quesadilla (teriyaki sauce on the side) and the jade chicken is good in ANYTHING!  Throw in some chicken fried rice and some refried beans and you have the makings for awesomeness.

My husband made a comment that this is the food that I'm going to crave when I'm pregnant.  Well, I'm not pregnant but I am craving it ALL THE TIME!!!

I can't sing it's praises enough!  Be prepared though, the secret is out and the place gets busy.  You will not be sorry though :)

I LOVE YOU CHINO!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A great mix of fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine. I'm from the pacific NW and I'm Chinese so this a neat combination for me:) and quite original in a way. Have a craving for Chinese and Mexican food? No problem  visit Chino Bandino"}
{"text":"This kind of cultural food fusion is just so amazing. I love the way you can order and how fast they're are with customer service. I love that they gave me samples my first time to see what I want to order."}
{"text":"3.75 stars 
Great place for a quick un-healthy lunch. 
I ordered the Jerk Chicken, Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice with veggies -
The jerk chicken and fried rice were great, but the red chicken and veggies can be forgotten. Red chicken was mostly fried breading than actual chicken and the veggies were a couple pieces of raw broccoli, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and onions.
Husband got the carnitas and jerk chicken with rice and beans. 
Both his meat selections were fantastic. The beans are addicting! They are more of a bean puree but the flavor is exceptional. 
To top off a pretty decent meal you get a delicious cookie (snickerdoodle for me) which makes the trip to Chino Bandido even more worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. They have some dishes you just don't find elsewhere. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is the portions tend to be small. O.K. for lunch but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"A must go destination in Phoenix.
Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!)
It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.

If it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!

If you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach!
(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and to be honest, it doesn't quite live up to the hype. The Jade Red chicken is very flavorful and the black beans are very good as well. I think that overall the thing that I'm not super stoked on about Chino Bandidos is that every time I leave my entire body is screaming \"WHAT JUST HAPPENED??\" 

It's a great place to go to if you have nothing else going on the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I hadn't been in probably 10 years so I didn't really remember what it was all about, just that I'd enjoyed it before and people always talk about how they love it.

So when my husband and I were in the area and in need of some quick food Sunday afternoon we headed over.

The guy at the counter was so incredibly genuine and nice. He helped us with the order form which for whatever reason is a bit confusing. I love the different combinations you can make. I didn't get too adventurous this time, I was a little overwhelmed, but I'd go back and try it again. I loved my husbands quesadilla with machaca.

It was totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"First time at Chino Bandito. Arrived at 5:30 on a Thursday evening and only 12 diners. Hmm. 

I ordered Pollo Diablo, Jen Red Pork, Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice. All items were presented in bite-sized portions. They were fresh but lacked a lot of pizazz that I'd been hearing about. The pollo Diablo was supposed to be the hottest item out there. It was medium heat. I think it needed sauce cuz it seemed more like chicken nuggets with some spice to me. 

The Jen Red was good but, again, not very saucy. The rice was okay.  Just not much flavor exuding from it. The beans were pretty awful. They were runny and tasted canned. 

The cookie on the side was a nice touch. 

Not sure if I'll be back. It's not in a great location, the decor is despicable (card tables, plastic chairs, dirty floor and snapshots of kids for art) and an annoying TV. I felt like I was in school, eating a school lunch. 

These guys need to get a clue that folks want ambiance with their meal, not crap they thought was cute when they were young."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I am not quite sure what I was expecting when I arrived at Chino Bandido but it has far exceeded any expectation I may have had. You start by grabbing a pad and a pen and writing down your order by number (there's a large menu board with pictures) then choose if you want the item as itself, as a quesadilla or as a burrito then you choose your rice and bean types. I highly, highly recommend the jade red chicken and machaca. Also you get a free snickerdoodle with each meal! I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"The jade red chicken is amazing. The cookies are the perfect ending to a meal."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give stars lightly.  

I was first introduced to Chino Bandido (or 'Chinos', as it's affectionately called by its regulars) by some friends of ours.  It was explained to me that it was a cross between Chinese food and Mexican food.  

I'm sure you might be saying 'Huh?' right about now.

Trust me on this one.  They have the most amazing burritos, quesadillas, and beans.  They have anywhere from very mild (teriyaki chicken) to really spicy (cuban black beans).  They have amazing fried rice and carnitas.  

It all comes together in what can only be described as an addicting concoction.  My stomach is grumbling as I write this ... just at the thought of this place.  They actually have die-hard regulars that have written poems and music about their food.  (Poems and music!)

Don't come here for the ambiance.  It's a hole in the wall.  Don't let that scare you.  Walk right up to the counter, tell them that you've never been there before, and prepare yourself to be taken on a tour of the food.  

Seriously -- they'll give you samples so you know what you like!

No, I'm not joking.

They have quite a lunch crowd during the week.  (For some reason, engineers just flock to this place).  Come either around 11:00 or after 1:00 to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars but I just can't....maybe it was an off night, maybe not. I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

The area itself where they are located is not so great, the strip mall is a dump overall and it appeared that someone threw up right outside the entrance which is not a great sign. The inside is brightly lit but dirty. It is in dire need of of a deep cleaning which they then need to maintain.

The ordering process is tricky made even more of a pain by having to dig through my purse to find a pen since there were no pencils and no one who seemed willing to go get more. Once we figured out how to order we headed for the line where one lady double checked that we did it right and then off to another to pay. $28 for 3 meals and 3 sodas. We filled up our drinks and sat down to wait. The food came out in less than 10 minutes but my sons teriyaki chicken was Luke warm at best. I had the red jade chicken which was fairly decent and reminded me of general tso's but more tomato based. My husband had a chili relleno, some sort of chicken and jerk rice....he was very happy with his meal and cleaned his little aluminum bowl out.

Maybe I will give them another shot....maybe not."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is unique. Jamaican, Mexican AND Chinese food in one place?!?!? The hell you say!!! It's true :) The food is good. They are consistent. The employees are nice. The place is always busy, which you know from my previous reviews that is a good sign in almost any business that they don't suck. 
Every meal comes with a fresh baked Snickerdoodle, and theirs are delicious :P
Do yourself a favor, because there's just one Chino Bandido, take 6 more Snickerdoodles home with ya. You're welcome....you can trust me I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"Such a gut bomb of amazingness! Got the 2 combo with jade chicken and ranchero something (#2, fried chili). It was all so tasty and amazing.

I would be back if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, more of the combinations that make it. They let you sample the top choices which was great. I ordered the:

Refried Black Beans: Great, different but I really enjoyed them.
Jerk Chicken Fried Rice: Also good and had nice crunch to it.
Jade Red Chicken Buritto: Better than the sample, trust me. Having it fresh was so good and saucier. I had it in a buritto and it was easily the best thing there.
Carnitas Quesadilla: Really good, not quite as good as the Jade Red Chicken but definately something I would order again. Crunchy and crispy yet filling and still dense at the same time.
Snickerdoodle Cookie: Comes with it and was a darn good cookie. Thick but not overcooked and cooked through as well. Loved it.

Great place to try and eat. A lot of food for sure but what makes this place is the atmosphere and the weird combinations they offer."}
{"text":"The flavor was amazing! I was mad, they didn't fill my large bowl up and sad when it was all gone. I can't wait to go back. I had the black beans, jerk chicken rice, diablo chicken and red chicken. The only thing I didn't really care for but can live with was the texture of the chicken, it was kinda tough but I didn't care."}
{"text":"Don't get the appeal. My brothers love it but I was underwhelmed. It's really nothing special."}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy.  I have never been there before and I wasn't sure what to order.  The young lady at the front counter was super helpful and offered me samples of their different types of meats.  I ended up getting teriyaki chicken and the jade red chicken made into a quesadilla.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido from the front of the restaurant makes one curious if they should be going there. As soon as you step foot inside however, one realizes it was built for quality of food, and the atmosphere came second. They have a vast menu with creative and unique menu options, and one gets to build their own meal on a form and within 10 minutes, your food is out and you get a little cookie. It is a great place if you want to try something food, or just can't decide between mexican or asian food."}
{"text":"I have heard for years how amazing the food is here. We decided to finally give it a shot and when we first walked in it was so dirty and looked like a cafeteria with card tables that I thought \"the food must be AMAZING if people are still raving about it with it as dumpy as this is.\"  I got teriyaki chicken with rice, beans, and quesadillas and the food was bland, dry, and mediocre. My husband got a chicken burrito and he said it was mediocre as well. So I don't get it? Is there one dish that is amazing that keeps people coming back for more? Or is it just not my style?  I'm totally confused. The service was fast and friendly so they had that going for them. But that was about it."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I have tried everything on their menu.
I can honestly say that everything on their menu is awesome.
Even the stuff I would no normally order again was pretty good.
You cannot go wrong with the Jade and Jerk chicken.
Love the Snickerdoodles too.

The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is the ordering system...and that is all I am going to say about it...oh and maybe the long lines...because Chino's is so freaking good!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chino's since I was a little kid! I love it and take all out-of-town visitors here. Try the Jade Red Chicken w/ Jerk fried rice and black beans - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Mexican and Chinese are both delicious so of course one would expect them to be delicious together.  Therefore I decided to stop here on a recent trip to AZ.  Kind of a divey feel to the restaurant but that's ok, I don't mind.  Also - I love the Mexican Panda mascot!  So as I said, it is not a super nice place.  You walk up to the counter and place your order then have a seat in a almost cafeteria style room.  I ordered the pollo diablo with the jerk style rice.  When I got the bowl I thought it looked a little small but it was actually quite filling.  The meat was actually spicy which makes me happy and the rice was pretty good.  The prices were good so overall it was an ok lunch."}
{"text":"The guys in the family love this place and go there often. Not real fond of the atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"An interesting concept. This is my second time here and it wasn't as good as I remember. We ordered the red chicken spicy pork and jerk fried rice. Yes quite the combo. I did like the black beans. They were flavorful and not too smooth. The rice tasted so so. It did have an ok flavor but rice was a bit old and stale. Pork was tough and overfried. The chicken had a good flavor. Just the right amount spice. While it is easy to order it is and a dicey stile atmosphere which is fun and the place was super packed. It was a. It overrated. Worth truly worth trying once."}
{"text":"Chino my Chino.

I simply love the food here. Try it, you will like it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely like this fusion.  Definitely visit their website to learn how to order if you can in advance if not the service is definitely friendly.  If you walk in for your first time ask for a sample, they will give you sample taste for their most popular items.  I fell in love with the red jade chicken and the carnitas.  I prefer the pork fried rice.  I don't get my stuff in a burrito nor a quesadilla because i feel you get more meat if you order outside a tortilla.  I drove from downtown here twice in 2 weeks just to eat here and once from Laveen.  Definitely worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. It's amazing. They let you try samples before you order and are very friendly! Also they give you a lot of food. I loved the combinations of Chinese and Mexican flavors. I can't believe it took me so long to try this place."}
{"text":"This place has some hits and some misses.   The temperature of our food was the major miss.   I had the jade chicken and jerk rice.   The chicken was room temp, there was a decent flavor.  The rice had great flavor.   The black beans were awesome though.   Great spice and heat.   It is definitely a dive but that doesn't mean you can't clean tables.... All of them were trashed (another  miss)"}
{"text":"It's a crazy place that takes a PhD in hypergeometry to understand how to order. Inventive food, if you're up for that sort of thing. with the unique choices and variations they gave me a sampler of everthing so I could make up my mind.

What you've heard about the snookerdoodle is correct. My theory is it's laced with nicotine -  it's addictive.

I marked yes on wait service because it was slow and the owner brought our food over, he probably doens't always do this."}
{"text":"I found the beginning of the experience to be frustrating and I'm still not clear on how it was supposed to work. We went in, discovered the order sheet, and sat down to figure it out. Then I got into what appeared to be a line but was really more like 20 confused people. I noticed \"regulars\" veering around the pack and placing their orders so I finally did the same, but I believe I was technically cutting in front of other guests. Who knows?

The portions were good and the price was right, but we won't be returning since it was a bit out of our way. Note from my hubby: don't combine the jerk chicken, pollo diablo, and jerk fried rice. Something about the combo just didn't sit right. Mighty spicy, though! Oh and the Snickerdoodle was delish; the chocolate chip cookie was a bit too dry."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me.  Are five-star yelp reviews a condition of employment at this place?  I love a good dive more than the next guy, but this place isn't funky, it's filthy.  I've seen cleaner crack houses.

 \"Fusion\" here means doing a crappy job of two cuisines and hoping nobody notices after the mashup.  The result isn't boring, just unpalatable.  Pour chalula on some chow mien and you'll do a better job.  (I tried that, and it was a step up).  Quick tip - they will provides \"tastes\" (odd use of the word, considering the lack thereof) so if you really need to check this place, try a sample, and follow your instinct to turn around and bolt.

Can't understand the four stars.  But I also can't understand why Palin got more votes than family members.

We had to go here for a christmas gathering.  I know I'd been bad, but next time, Santa, just go with the coal."}
{"text":"This is a grease spoon of a place, but I suppose when you go to a Chinese Mexican restaurant you probably don't expect it to serve you healthy food. This place was recommended to me by a couple of coworkers, plus I heard about it being featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, so decided to give it a shot. It seemed like it was a bunch of high school kids working there, and there is nothing really wrong with that.

The food was actually a pretty big disappointment. I had the Jade Red Chicken in quesadilla, which was the only good item in my meal. I also ordered the Carnitas in a burrito. The meat was very dry, and other than being wrapped in a tortilla and warmed up, there was nothing else to it. I had Jerk Fried Rice which was a-ok, and black beans which were SUPER salty and I didn't end up eating. If I were to go back, I would either order quesadilla style only or plain. Rolling the meat up in a tortilla really didn't do much for me. I came home and checked out the video from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and have to say that the original location looks a lot better. I probably won't be back at Chandler location, but might give the original another try. Interesting concept, I wish the food was better!"}
{"text":"Headed here after reading all the reviews.  It was a fusion mix that sounds strange but somehow works.  This hole in the wall is loaded with all types of customers: students, families, couples, friends, young and old.  The portions don't seem huge but I was stuffed. Come over for a different experience!"}
{"text":"Look... If you go to a hole in the wall dive then expect dive style food. This place is the bomb for dive flavors and what a concept it has. The mixing of Mexican and Chinese foods form a great fusion meal. The punch of chilies that hit your throat with every Mexican dish entree accompanied with the sweet taste of Chinese cuisine is just plain delicious. 
This place was featured on The Food Networks \"Diners, Driven-Ins, and Dives\" and it deserved to be. Like Guy from Tripple D, I too would suggest this dive for those looking to try something not of the norm."}
{"text":"This food is fast, inexpensive and outstanding!  Everything I tried from the family was outstanding.  I particularly enjoyed the Jade Red Chicken.  The only problem is there is only one location!  Franchise!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Doesn't even taste like fast food... so who wouldn't like it?

The ambiance is awesome, love the panda.

Menu is great. Take the paper, agonize about what tasty goodness you want to try next, and then hand it over whenever you are ready.

And you get a cookie!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place forever and it is amazing.  Check out this review I found at Phoenixonabudget.com 

http://phoenixonabudget.com/2008/08/20/chino-bandido-a-strip-mall-treasure/

Defintely try the Jade Red Chicken - it is the best!"}
{"text":"I love Chino Bandito for takeout. I wouldn't want to eat there, but I like taking the blazing tin trough of goodness home to unwrap and savor it! My favorite is the Jade Chicken, alone or as a quesadilla. The jerk chicken is my other go-to selection but the egg fu young is another good option. JD likes the hengrenade chicken, barbequed pork,  the carnitas and the machaca all in quesadillas. 
I think the jerk fried rice is delicious and usually try to steal some of JD's since he gets double rice and no beans. I have to go with the black beans, even though their consistency reminds me of hot road tar. They taste kind of sweet. Add some of CB's homemade salsa and its a tantalizing side dish that compliments a really good takeout meal. The cookies arent bad either. Two combo meals with tax adds up to $17.33. Super cheap for the amout of food you get."}
{"text":"Though you may need a PhD to figure out how to order using one of their slips, the service is outwardly cordial and they hand out samples as if it was National Tapas Day. The place itself is surreal as if in an Almodovar film. Opting for the sweet and sour chicken burrito, Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice, I was able to make an entire days meal out of this one order. The end results are remarkably melding and might I say a breath of fresh, greasy air. It works. It somehow works."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a side of black beans and egg Foo young with your hen grenade cheese quesedilla? Plate lickin good!"}
{"text":"Food is always consistent sometimes too much so. Someone needs to tell the cooks under done chicken is at least as hazardous as under done pork. Tired of chicken but the jen red chicken is always cooked properly the Jen red pork on the other hand is always overcooked to the point of the coating being hard crunchy and burnt tasting.  Been like this for years I am tired of talking to staff.  

Could someone please teach the cooks to properly cook pork ot take it off the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite \"hole in the wall\" restaurants.  Been going to Chino's since the only one was way up on the west side - and I was coming from Ahwatukee.

I have turned many people on to Chino's and all have become lifetime fans (except one person who is a bit \"picky\").

The food is like nothing you can find anywhere else.  It is fantastic.  All served in aluminum to-go containers.  You sit at folding tables on conference chairs, floor is stained concrete, drinks are from styrofoam cups.  This is not 5 star dining, but is AMAZING feel good, happy food.  I have tried everything over the years and my favorites are Jade Red Chicken either plain, in a burrito or in a quesadilla, Emerald Chicken, Chilli Rellano (this is like none you have ever had, crunchy, pick it up and eat it), always-always Caribbean Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice.

Great place for kids, families, friends.  Casual, easy, feels great.  Literally enough food for 2 full meals.  All meals served with a homemade, warm SnickerDoodle cookie (as if you could possibly eat that after the 2-3 pounds in your order).

I love this place and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Have I seriously not reviewed Chinos?????  How can that be???? I've been coming to Chino's for about 20 years. I started at the only location, up on Bell and 19th Ave (I think that's where it is) even though I live in Ahwatukee. Then, after 4 years of them having a sign saying \"Chandler location coming soon!\", it finally opened. I was in heaven!!  Went there often until it unfortunately closed and now it's back occasionally to the one on the west side.

Why do I love it? The food. Simply awesome! Comfort food, filling, tastes delicious, and tons of it! How do you mix Mexican, Caribbean and Chinese? Never thought of it, but Chino's does it and my family and I LOVE it! Love that you can get whatever you want as an entree, in a burrito or in a quesadilla. Love that it's served in a metal to-go container, sitting at plastic tables and chairs. It's the ultimate dive, hole in the wall, established forever, for good reason, place. The service is typically friendly and the cookies that come with your dish, especially when they're the chocolate volcano cookies, are awesome! Black Caribbean beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken and emerald chicken, yummmmm! I absolutely love this place.

Seriously, if you've never tried this place, it is an absolute must try!!! Once you do, if you're like me, a week or so later you'll start to crave it,...so good."}
{"text":"Chino really knows how to keep things interesting! I love their fusion cuisine and flawless blend of flavors. I still have a lot of combinations to try but iv got time cause I will be a life long customer.
++Chino if you do read this... spice up the decor some more! Id love to have more fun stuff to look at when I visit :)"}
{"text":"Kind of different food with combination of tastes from Chinese and Mexican. Worth a shot once."}
{"text":"Simple concept, lots of choices, pretty tasty and inexpensive food. We didn't know how to order and the staff was exceptionally nice and motivated. There was also a pretty decent beer selection. The free cookie was awesome!! I would have given another star if the dining room wasn't so disgustingly dirty. Please hire someone to bus tables and keep the floor swept. A dirty front, makes me believe theres a SUPER dirty back..."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits to Chino Bandido.  First heard about it from a friend who came from Minnesota who came with orders from her friends not to miss Chino Bandido.  We went there and have always enjoyed each visit there.  Last week was my last visit and I had the Jade Chicken.  Thought it would be too spicy (melt my spoon maybe) but it wasn't.  A very nicely flavored dish that I'll have again on my next visit.  Chino Bandido must still maintain it's calling power since last week there was a tourist taking a picture of the sign presumably for the folks back home.  Each time I go to CB, I've found the service to be quick and the server brings the food almost as soon as I've found a table."}
{"text":"So what do you call a place that serves decent Mexican food, outstanding chicken dishes with some Asian influence?  Well, they call it Chino Bandido's!

Now I'll admit, I get a charge and some amusement by watching Guy Fieri of Food Network visit these local DDD.  We have also visited quite a few of Guy's places over the years.  The yummy Guatemalan place in Santa Fe, NM is probably the best, while there's been quite a few near misses, too.  But Chino Bandido's.... well we somehow missed that episode.

So when I saw that sign, with Guy's gargantuan smiling face (see photo) I thought okay, what am I in for this evening?  Well not to worry. As it turned out it, it was all for the best, as the Four Star review might indicate. 

According to Food Network: \"Chino Bandido's Chinese-Mexican-Jamaican dishes have garnered lifelong fans. Guy loved the fusion, calling it one of the most original on DDD. The best part? The menu has more than 90,000 combinations. For a spicy option try the Pollo Diablo, Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Pow!\"  Ugh, I could have done without that pow. LOL

The first thing that's tricks you as you enter, is the industrial, high ceilings and plastic 10 foot folding tables and chairs right out of Sam's Club, or Costco. The other thing you notice is the re, Chinese \"Great Wall\" muriel with a panda dressed as a Via Zapata style bandido. Some things don't translate I guess. LOL

I do not believe Chino Bandido's is Chinese at all. Well, not in the traditional sense. Heck, not in any sense really.  Yes, I see a Fried Rice, Egg Foo Yung, Chinese BBQ Pork, and Teriyaki Chicken on the menu.  But no Asian soups.  No General Tso's, no Orange Beef or Chicken, no Kung Pow, no buckwheat noodles, I could go on.

What I see is a very strong Jamaican influence.  That Panda could easily be a photo-shopped for Bob Marley because of all the Jerky Chicken and Jerky Rice. Sorry guys, or should I say Guy. LOL

But there were some hiccups along the way, but I really love this place. And two hundred or of my co-workers who seem to come each day cannot be all wrong. LOL

For me, just order the Jerky Chicken (photo) and you'll see what I mean. Delicious. Expect to pay $8 or so. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was looking for dinner and decided to come here due to the raving reviews. So it appears you come in, fill out some paperwork on what you'd like to order, pay, take a seat, and they will bring you your order. The paperwork appears complicated if its your first time but they are very friendly and will walk you through it. You can even sample some of the chicken if you have trouble deciding. 

You can order a one meat combo or a two meat combo. I opted for the jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. I thought the chicken was flavored very well and has a nice kick. I expected a little more from the rice, but it was still tasty nonetheless. My husband ordered the two meat combo with the jade red chicken and emerald chicken. While the jade red chicken apparently is their most popular item, I did not care for it as it tasted like any other sweet and sour fried chicken from a Chinese fast food restaurant. I thought the emerald chicken was great but then again I've always enjoyed ginger scallion sauce on anything. Of the three, I liked the jerk chicken best but it can be because I'm more exposed to the other two flavors due to my Chinese background and therefore find them a tad less exciting.

Overall, I find the food here to be pretty good and the prices are very fair. Great service. And oh, complimentary cookie with each combo ordered - soo delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chino for YEARS!  I won't say how long cause it makes me feel old.  Tonight I brought in some first timers!  They loved it!  The service is always friendly, the price is amazing and the food is great.  I forgot to tell the newbies about the famous Volcano Cookies,... next time.  Just wished there was a Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Amazing! 
It's a hole in the wall, but the food is soooo delicious! The jerk chicken rice is my favorite! And the carnitas are always juicy and are perfect in a quesadilla....."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing the place on Triple D, and after hearing a few great reviews from some friends.  I tried what most yelpers seemed to be recommending.. the jade chicken quesidilla, and the jerk chicken rice.  The food to me tasted like what I would get if I were to mix taco bell and panda express together.  Not bad enough to not eat, but nothing I'll ever need again.  I think in theory the idea works, but the quality of the ingredients seemed to be lacking.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day or at a bad time, but we most likely won't be going back any time soon, especially with so many better options in the valley."}
{"text":"Such a unique experience! Like nothing you've ever tried...think Mexican/Chinese fusion with a twist! I love the machaca quesadilla, jade red chicken, black beans and jerk rice. And you get a snickerdoodle cookie with every meal. This place was in Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. Such a fun place :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the 19th and Greenway (original) location for years. Loved their Pollo Diablo and jerk-fried rice. However, several months ago I ordered a half dozen of their snickerdoodle cookies and both my wife and I got severe food poisoning from them which knocked us out for the entire weekend. I give them two stars because of the fact that they're unique and I enjoyed their food for a long time with no problems, but places like this only get one chance with me and I will never eat there again. In addition, they raised their prices to over $10 per combo plate when you get a drink, and that's on the pricey side for what you get. Not worth any more than about $6. Summary - this place is off the table for me, but if you're willing to risk food poisoning and you like swiftly-prepared spicy food, give it a shot. Guy Fieri seemed to like it (it was reviewed on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives not too long ago). Definitely a dive IMO - and I second a previous reviewer's comment - \"are we in a cafeteria?\""}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. ..if you love Mexican and Chinese you will love this place!!!! It's a great combo you'd never think would work until you eat it. And they bake cookies fresh daily that come with your meal..."}
{"text":"All hype! I ordered the machaca and terryiAki with jerk friend rice and black beans. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I live downtown and don't think I'll make the drive back. At least I can said I tried it."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken, hengrenade chicken, jerk fried rice and black beans! That's my go to! And a snicker doodle cookie to top it all off!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is everything I could ever ask for in a fusion of two types of cuisine!! The combination of Chinese and Mexican food will blow your mind and is incredibly delicious. After hearing about the amazingness that is Chino Bandido for many years I finally made my way there and was surprised at just how good it really was. The staff was very friendly and made our first experience an enjoyable one. The jade red chicken and emarald chicken were by my favorites but I think anything you order here would be delicious and I intend to try as much as I can in the future!!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept and amazing flavors. Jade Red Chicken is a must! Pork fried rice is meaty and delicious and the refried black beans are solid too. Jerk chicken was recommended but kinda sucks so I wouldn't waste your time with it. Go here!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 4x in 2 months, it's very good and have fun testing out the menu. The Jade red chicken is best in a quesadilla, jerk fried rice, hengrenade is a good medium spice option and the emerald chicken are all pretty tasty. I like that they have descriptions for all because it's a bit overwhelming. The staff is great help and very friendly. We have always done out but they have cafeteria style seating available."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Have been coming here for 15+ years and the taste is the exact same, if not better!!!!"}
{"text":"Not wowed like I expected to be since our friends rave about this place.  The food was decent.  Next time we would try the burrito option instead of just the \"Chino\" style.  The place smelled a little and there was a fly problem.  Not great additions to our dining experience."}
{"text":"Jade red is the best!  Snickerdoodles are awesome - only reason it gets a 4 star is because of the potential for your food to fight back later.  Overall a great hole in the wall place that is a solid lunch choice"}
{"text":"I am SO excited that we finally got to try this place! Since this was our first time the guy at the front explained everything to us & let us try some different items off the menu.  We got combo meals, mine was chicken fried rice, refried beans, teriyaki quesadilla & jade red chicken. Crazy amount of food. It was all SOOOOO good. My only complaint would be to ask for my fried rice without green onions as I don't really care for them & it had tons. Yes the place is divey but hey, the food rocks! $18 for 2 combo meals & a drink. They even brought us 2 yummy cookies!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. A bit of a hole in the wall.  Just give it a try and you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to try this place last night with my wife. We ordered a number 6 and 7 with chicken fried rice. The food could definitely improve on many things such as serving it HOT. Both orders came out ice cold like my drink. The price i thought was over priced for something Panda Express could serve extremly better. Overall I wont be visiting back and definitely not recommend this place. If you want something with rice and chicken you'd be better off going to PF Changs or Panda Express. $20 for both meals is not the business here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.
I'm a huge fan of the Jade red chicken and the jerk fried chicken. I always get it in quesadillas with refried black beans and jerk fried rice. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Imagine a Parade of Pleasure for your Taste Buds. That's what you get here. Amazing food at a reasonable price, plus you get a free Snicker Doodle Cookie!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here after living in the West Valley for a little over a year. The menu was kind of confusing but we figured it out thanks to some help from an employee. I got the jade chicken in a quesadilla & is was amazeballs! Looking forward to eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful! Staff is consistently friendly and kind. The food is always yummy!  Chino is always packed so that should tell you how great they are!"}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot.

* Jerk Chicken = very good
* Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later
* Jade Red Chicken = excellent
* Pork Fried Rice = very good
* Red Salsa Stuff = excellent
* Refried Beans = standard
* Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is as good as it gets. I was so hesitant to try it at first... Mexican and a Chinese food mix. So glad I did. My favorite place to eat in the valley by far!"}
{"text":"I suppose truly this must not be for everyone, but as far as i am concerned, this is a great little chinese/mexican fusion place. Keep in mind the word fusion describes the food to a T. it is a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet and ... amazing.

Not expensive and at and so if you are looking for something different, then you have found it.
19th avenue and greenway and also a location in chandler.

give it a try

have fun, be safe and good luck"}
{"text":"One of those truly unique places! Love the pulled pork(carnitas) and the emerald chicken, the black beans and fried rice are to die for... Nothing I've tried has let me down (a teriyaki quesadilla was just ok, but then I'm not a big teriyaki fan)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Chinos for close to 15 years now and it seems to me that ever since it was featured on DDD that prices have gone up and portions have gone down. 

I usually pass on the rice and ask for a double order of beans. This passed visit, my wife ordered a small side of beans with her quesadilla. They put my double order of beans in a big styrofoam container and only filled it up to the small beans container level. I compared the two and realized I got duped. Jade red chicken is still delicious but the portions look like more of a kids meal. My machaca burrito looked like something from Taco Bells value meal. 

Foods good but that value isn't there anymore. We as a family are probably going to find a new tradition to eat at. It's always sad to see a place my family has been eating for this long to go this far downhill."}
{"text":"Any time I head out of state and come back to my home in AZ, I always make a trip to Chino Bandidos to get my fix. I probably eat here two or three times a week when I'm able to settle.

I just about always get the Jade Red Chicken in a Burrito and then either Machata, Carnitas or Emerald Chicken in a Quesadilla. Their Black Beans + Jerk Fried Rice as the side choices is to die for, especially mixed together. This isn't to say that any of the selections aren't excellent; I've tried just about everything and there was nothing I didn't like. A million times better than Panda Express.

Ordering is confusing for newbies but once you get the hang of it, you'll prefer it to any other form of ordering because it actually speeds things up if the customers know what they're doing. And for the customers that are confused, if they just walk up to the counter with a confused look, there's always an employee that will move to the side, explain the ordering, and give samples of the most popular items.

All hail Chinos! Here's hoping they franchise and/or continue to expand. I seriously think if the owners took a plunge or accepted investment opportunity, this could be a successful national chain. Especially if the investors provided some advice on improving the ordering and aesthetic of the restaurants, which is just about the only downside (and only a surface one). Some people might take the pseudo-Asian/Mexican promotionals / decorations / poetry as a little less than politically correct; it doesn't bug me but I can see how it might bug others."}
{"text":"Lets just say my coworker and I did not do good the rest of the day after eating here...."}
{"text":"Food is awesome !!! Highly recommend it. Took a friend for his birthday and he loved it."}
{"text":"Great food. Interesting combinations that are worth the try. The workers are very helpful and courteous. The place is a bit divey but worth it for the combination of flavors in their dishes. I love the simplicity of this restaurant. It's not flashy but it's wonderfully flavorful!"}
{"text":"Best place for fusion Mexican food in town! Just moved out to AZ and could not find anything close to what authentic Mexican food would taste like till I went to Bandido.  I'm going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Honestly, I do not understand why people like this place so much. To me it's always over crowded and the food is just so-so.  Giving it two stars just because the people there are nice and they have a unique concept of mixing Chinese and Mexican cuisine. Personally, I would rather go to either a Chinese or Mexican restaurant and get the real stuff, freshly prepared, and sit-down service."}
{"text":"Chino Bandito is a great takeout place to eat! Prices are reasonable and they always have your food fast. Get"}
{"text":"Love the chile relleno even though it melts the cheap fork and knife.

Black beans and white rice are fun sides."}
{"text":"I wish my kids enjoyed the rice with teriyaki sauce or the rice with gravy because a bowl of it is free for kids.  Mine didn't enjoy either sauce.  You can add chicken to it for $1.50... way cheap kids meal.  It also comes with a drink and cookie.

I am a vegetarian and try to eat healthy.  This place doesn't leave many options for me.  I do really really like the chili relleno but it is greasy and I wouldn't eat it very often.  I eat it with the plain rice and black beans.  I just LOVE the black beans... my favorite part of the whole restaurant.  I tried the fried rice and it was way to greasy for my tastes.  The vegetarian egg fu young was not good at all.  Greasy and no flavor.

The cookies are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for dinner after hearing all of the hype and were actually somewhat disappointed.  The staff was very friendly and walked us through the menu by allowing us to try some of their most popular items - bonus!  The food was just ok...not overly flavorful and a little overcooked.  I tried the jade chicken with chicken fried rice and thought it was good, certainly not great.  However, I barely made it home before the food went right through me...not good!  This place is popular, so it is doing something right, but it didn't win me over and make me a fan."}
{"text":"Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before.  It's strange and fascinating.  I live fairly close by and the food is fine, but it certainly doesn't blow your mind.  It's the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I don't need to go for another 6 months or a year.  The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal.  Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The food is super yummy and the service is always great.  My only complaint is that there is an off smell in the building.  Clearly that doesn't keep me away though,  the food is too good. 
I do love that they have Legos to play with, but it would be great is they washed or bleached them every once in awhile, they are pretty dirty.  That and the smell are the only reason I docked a star."}
{"text":"Two words people: emerald chicken. Best served in a quesadilla.
Used to get the black beans all the time but switched to re-fried and haven't gone back. Life changing. 
I have never had a more delicious snickerdoodle cookie. 

The only thing I don't like is Pepsi product!!! Switch to Coke!

If you're not from AZ you must try this place. You will not regret it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! The people were super friendly and the service is really fast I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. They could really use a revamp on the inside, it feels like a cafeteria, which I didn't love. But the food was awesome! Wrapping the chicken in a burrito gives it a twist for sure. Otherwise you can order it like normal Chinese food with rice. Their jerk rice was really good and their version of sweet and sour chicken was amazing. I will be going back, but just for take out next time."}
{"text":"Food is amazing 
They need a new location in a better area and cleaner place"}
{"text":"Really I don't get the good reviews. I mean 5 star? So they are the top of the bottom? I realize I can't compare the place to T-Cooks, or Elements but come on. For fast food, dive type places it's ok. Really only reason to go might be to say you had Mexican Chinese food. If you are not a regular the menu is a mess, you have to figure out what you want to combine and what sauces to put on it. The employees are very helpful though. None of the ingredients are fresh. The beans barely have any beans left, just a mushy slop with decent flavor. You will feel this food in your stomach for hours after. The place is dirty, not sure how they pass health inspections, I'm afraid to look up their record online. It's crowded and obviously has fans. I just don't get it except that it's unique and fun in a gimmicky way. So once you see past the gimmick you realize it's just bad food. Now maybe if they were open at 2am I'd have a whole new appreciation for the food."}
{"text":"I must admit, at first sight I was a little skeptical, but they have some amazing food here. Loads of flavor, lots of food, and inexpensive prices. If it's your first time there, they give you free samples of their menu and explain how to order to you. If you are in the area, you have to try this place. If you're not in the area, it's still worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for lunch with my mom. We both had the combination platter with jade red chicken, machaca, chicken fried rice, and black beans and devoured all of it. I was originally apprehensive about trying Chinese-Mexican fusion, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I will definitely be back with my husband so he can try it."}
{"text":"Another DD&D diner and have to admit, it wasn't bad. It was actually tasty, the quesadilla was delicious, i just couldn't finish it since their portions are HUGE! Ordered the jade chicken (yummy), spicy rice (that didn't have any spice at all!) and the quesadilla. Good food, price was a little high, but it was worth it. Oh, and have some room for their cookies!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places......of all time.  I absolutely adore the concept of creative fusion cuisine.  Chinese-Mexican...SAY WHAAA??  
This is what America is all about.  This is why we fight terrorism.  ;-)

Now they have this ridiculous byzantine menu and ordering process, which was designed by some sorta IRS bureaucrat...and they refuse to change it!! DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU.  You can get through it and you must, because waiting for you on the other side is fantastic food.  

It is best to go with a friend and have them help you order, but if you can't here is my tip.  Find the section that says \"Combinations.\" Then select two of the following (at the top).  \"Chinese BBQ Pork\" and \"Jerk Chicken.\"  And yes rice and beans.  

Now GO!"}
{"text":"Today I made the trek to go and visit an old friend, my good friend the Chino.. The one and only Bandido. He and I have a few years of history and today I remembered how much I had missed him in my life. I had to 'act' new again and ask for samples. I always loved that about Chino Bandido: The sampling and concept of 'try before you eat'. The staff is always so friendly and patient here and more than willing to explain the menu and how it all works here. Let's face it , a Chinese mixed with Mexican and a tad of Jamaican ... well, it can blow your mind. My favorites are the Jade Red : simplistic and left alone. However, you can have it, or anything else for that matter, placed into a quesadilla or a burrito. My other favorite is the HenGrenade Chicken, a milder version of jerk chicken. Today I did have that placed into a quesadilla. I upgraded my white steamed rice for .80 cents (!!) to fried rice and one can do that with pork or chicken or keep it plain. I did mine with pork. I also love the Cuban style Black Refried Beans , but the regular refried beans are very good too! I love that every meal is placed in a round tin so it stays nice and hot! I also love that it's not seemingly too over powered with oil and grease , although I am not an idiot to think this is not fattening! ( The reason I have other reviews at that training facility ?!!) Accolades highlight the wall of fame here including Guy Fieri's Diners Drive In's and Dives . I can personally see why! Not one thing on this menu is bad. It may not be in the greatest area of PHX.. but it's clean and friendly and a fusion of epic deliciousness! Oh.. if you know my reviews, I have this thing about clean restrooms.. yep. Those are clean! Very clean! Don't forget your snicker doodle cookie or whatever else the cookie of the day may be! $8.40 for ALL of this ! I have not ever NOT seen this place not busy ! Chino, OH how I have missed our friendship.. Now why do you have to go straight to my hips ??! Bad , bad Bandido , but oh how I love you !"}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm a bit addicted to the Jade Red Chicken with a side of Chicken Fried rice.

The flavor is excellent! You can taste a bit of everything before you order but I can say that the Jade Red Chicken is one of the best.  If you really want to burn up your face hole, go with \"Jerk\" anything!

The staff at Chino are very friendly and come to bring your food to you after you order it at the counter.

Just try this place out, you really won't regret it and you'll be back for more!

Oh and, hail to the snikerdoodle!"}
{"text":"Two words. Emerald Chicken! I chose to have mine in a quesadilla and it was fabulous, but it also makes a mighty fine burrito! Newbs... make sure to get a lesson in ordering because it will be a bitch if you don't know what you're doing and also make sure to taste EVERYTHING they offer you. It's all so very delicious. I also really like the Jade chicken. It's not what you'd think when you hear Asian Mexican fusion... it's much better!"}
{"text":"As I pulled into the parking lot of Chino Bandido 30 minutes before closing, I quickly noted that there were still a lot of people dining inside - since I could see the interior through the large glass windows.

I ventured out this way, after my rigorous Table Tennis games, to pick up some food prior to my long trek homeward.

I haven't been here in over a decade, and from doing a quick run through of the place; not much has really changed.

I was in a hurry, so I quickly filled out the order sheet. 

I already knew what to order because I called my wife as I drove to this establishment and had her look up their menu. I chose the Jade chicken with Jerk Fried rice. My wife chose the two item combo that comprised of the Chile Releno and Machaca.

After submitting my order, I sat down by the door. I mused that this place must still be that good if that many people are still eating here even though they will be closing relatively shortly. 

This place is divey, minimally appointed, has a parking lot with various other patrons that may provide some trepidation at night, but it has an appeal all its own.

And that appeal is their food. 

Chino Bandido is a Phoenix Icon and has a unique identity all its own. 

They invented the phrase \"Asian Fusion\" before it even became synonymous with upscale dining. Even the town of Paradise Valley has an \"Asian Fusion\" establishment with a renowned chef. And I wouldn't have any trepidation of pulling into that parking lot, as I do here.

Chino Bandido is a trendsetter. 

They honestly provide good food, for a decent price that many can afford, and you don't even have to put on your designer clothes to dine here. 

Heck, there were people from a nearby apartment complex wearing their pajamas dining here. And our takeout food didn't come in elegant containers, and yet they stayed warm all the way home.

My Jade Chicken was delicious, and the Jerk Fried rice was quite flavorful and tasty. 

My wife commented on the fact that even after all these years, they still made a great Chile Releno and Machaca. 

Now, that is a wonderful testament to the consistency and quality of this long running establishment.

The neighborhood and the nearby facilities may give you pause, but the great food will certainly stir you to exclaim that there is a reason why this place still stands after all these years!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at chino since I was a young lad. My family and I have been going here for YEARS. Even back when it still had the original owners. Chino is amazing every time and there are a few select meals I love. The jerk chicken, jade red, and many many more are all delicious!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star if review was only based on food.  I usually get my food to go as the restaurant lacks any sort of ambience. My favorites on the menu are Carnitas quesadilla and Jade Red chicken."}
{"text":"awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. 

yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. 

i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.

although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! 

hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!"}
{"text":"Went because a friend recommended it. Mediocre in my opinion. Panda Express meets Taco Bell. I had the red chicken and jerk fried rice. Beans are bad either one you get. Best part was snicker doodle."}
{"text":"Whoever thought a fusion Chinese-Mexican restaurant could be this good? The selections are creative and the result is a flavor explosion you'll appreciate. I had the chicken with jade sauce and loved it. It's a very casual place where you place your order at the counter. There is plenty of room to find a table usually."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place during our winter vacay. We got to the restaurant during their weeknight dinner rush. The clerk was very helpful when we told her this was our first time at the restaurant. We both ordered jade red chicken, jerk fried rice, refried beans, and I had the shredded beef while my he got the emerald chicken. I LOVED the jade red chicken; it was crispy, sweet and slightly spicy. The jerk rice was to DIE for. I eat jamaican food all the time and their rice was surprisingly authenic. I also liked the emerald chicken. I didn't like the shredded beef ( I forgot the menu name of this item) so much. It tasted old and it was dry. 
This place is awesome and next time we go I'm getting more to take home to LA. Another great find thanks to Diners, Drive ins, and Dives."}
{"text":"Super awesome place. Nothing else I would try except for the jerk fried rice with any chicken. Well thats my personal fav. Cant get this anywhere I look around in the valley. They have a bunch of options for food lovers and I like the way explain things for new customers. Really nice crew there and amazing food. My top 5 places food places to go in the valley."}
{"text":"The other night I took my fiancé to Chino for the first time (I couldn't believe it when I realized he's never been lol), and he loved it! It was my first time back in a while, too, as we used to live pretty far away, and it was even better than I remembered!

I'm always so impressed with the service at Chino, they're always friendly and professional despite always being extremely busy. They never mess up an order either, and for the most part, food comes out really fast. Plus, free snickerdoodles (which are amazing)!

For dinner the other night, I got the Jade Red chicken and a Jerk chicken quesadilla, with the rice and refried black beans. I think that's so unique, to have the refried beans be black beans, and they are soo good! My fiancé went with the Jade Red chicken as well, and the Jen Red pork with double rice.

We both were in heaven, and ended up in food comas. I can't wait to go back again soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. My first time in, they insisted I try ALL of the meats. How awesome is that? I know what im getting, and, (being a little picky) I know I will like it! The jade red chicken is delicious.  A spicy-sweet sauce. I also love the fact that they give you a free cookie for dessert! I must always have dessert. It seemed like the staff cares here. Great way to keep business!"}
{"text":"chines fried rice and mexican beans.. chinese style orange chicken and quesadilla.. what a brilliant idea of fusion! The emerald chicken and jade red chicken quesadilla along with the beans and rice makes me want to head out and take a trip east to arizona. 
This place is sooooo good and js amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  

I have been away from the Valley for a decade. Chino's in North Phoenix was a favorite lunch destination. This location is hard to find but so much cleaner. 

Great food. Jerk chicken burrito and chile relent quesadilla. Yum. A complimentary snicker doodle to go...too. I dream about the refried black beans."}
{"text":"Family was in town and they couldn't decide what to eat, so i asked them to name some foods they liked. They named Mexican and Chinese food so I hopped on trusty Yelp to search for something to eat. Chinese/Mexican fusion? Hmm, now this I had to try! When I pulled up to the place I was instantly hesitant as the exterior looked quite unimpressive. I walked in and it was even less impressive, but the place was packed! Were they giving away free food? The dining room looked like a school cafeteria...why would so many people be here. I then caught a whiff of the food...mmmm! Hopped in line and then started to decipher the menu posted on the wall. I was a little confused. Jade Red chicken Quesadilla? Jerk Chicken Burrito? Why had I not thought of Chinese food in a burrito before?! Mind blown! Ordered both of these in a combo form which were accompanied by pork fried rice. The Jerk chicken was quite spicy, but  full of flavor. The jade red chicken had good balance and was probably the one I enjoyed more of the 2. To top it all off, the place gives you a free snickerdoodle cookie. The prices were incredibly cheap and the amounts of food were really good. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Love the chile rellenos and jerk chicken! I always enjoy my food here. I like the jerk fried rice. My girlfriend always gets the jade chicken and a ginger chicken(I don't remember the name). I love that they let you sample the food so you can see what you like. Homemade tortillas are bomb! The place is a little bit of a dive but I feel it adds to the experience. Price per portion is great! We will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Ok so I love the food here so much but it needs to be kept cleaner. I'll still come back though cuz it's yummy :)"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why there are so many good reviews for this place. I ordered red jade chicken bowl and my husband the jerk chicken. The fried rice was the only good thing that I actually liked. I would compare this to a Panda Express. Nothing special about their food. It wasn't horrible food but it absolutely wasn't that good at all. If you live close to here the. I guess it makes sense why you would come here versus some other fast food Chinese. 

The tables were so disgusting dirty.  The floors were gross. I wonder what the kitchen looked like. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place so I was excited to try it and see what they hype was about.  Needless to say that I was not impressed at all with what I had.

This place was really situated confusing for a first timer.  I ended up making my mind and having the machaca and white rice.  This meal was nothing to write home about.  Actually, my grandmother and mom made meals similar to this for years with better ingredients and better flavor.  The rice was cold and dry and the meat was cold and flavorless.  I probably wont be taking the drive back out there again unless it is for the snickerdoodle cookies they give which was the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"We were in the area...starving. So of course I yelp to see what's around and low and behold Chinos! It had been forever since being here. The order taker was awesome with helping us choose our meal. Very patient and accommodating. I had the jerk chicken over fried rice. Spicy and yummy. Hit the spot. Thank chino! It would be nice if they put a little money into fixing up the place. But then again I do appreciate good hole in the wall eateries. :-)"}
{"text":"Guilty as it gets....jerk chickens a little dry, but with good flavor, and complements the jade chicken. The black beans are fantastic."}
{"text":"Chino's is as good as it gets. 

The food is creative, delicious and simply amazing!

I love the different combinations of items, and more than anything else, I love the fun, homey, comfortable atmosphere and the incredibly friendly and generous owners.

I think this restaurant concept is perfect for franchising. The food is super creative and different than any other \"fusion\" restaurant (or at least from what I could find on the Internet!) I wish there were chains of it here in California so that I could get my Chino's fix everyday instead of twice a year!

My favorites are :
- Jen red pork 
- Hen grenade (in a quesadilla or burito)
- Emerald chicken (on its own with fried rice or in a quesadilla)
- I don't like beans in general, but I LOVE the black beans as well as the refried beans here. Don't know what their secret recipe for these two dishes are, but whatever it is, I LOVE it!
- Snickerdoodles!!! I pick up a dozen or two and bring back with me to California each time I come. If I am lucky and I happen to be there during the weekend when they make \"Volcano\" cookies, then I am really LUCKY cuz these are the BEST!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review saying I am a lifelong Chinese foodie and since I live in So Cal, Mexican is second nature to me. I saw Chino Bandido on DDD with Guy Fieri and swore that I would make a stop if I was ever in the area. This was one of the must try on the list, so here we go...

Since I had a later than I wanted breakfast @ Matt's, Kathy and I decided to share an entree, so we would have room for dinner. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, we decided on the combo of Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken and Pork fried rice. I thought the owner should have called the Jade Red Chicken Red Lantern Chicken or something to better reflect the color. The Jade Red Chicken was the tastiest out of the combo. It reminded me of Orange Chicken, but not as tangy or as greasy. The Jerk Chicken was Kathy's idea and it fell a little flat as other than the jerk rub, the chicken itself was bland and needed to be dipped in their hot sauce or hoisin sauce to help the flavor. The Pork fried rice was very good and tied the meal together.

I was tempted to order the BBQ Pork quesadilla, but I'm not training for any eating competitions, so waist be saved! Chino Bandido felt like Chinese food with a Mexican flair. If you look at what the majority of the people out there order, it is the Chinese meats with rice and either beans and/or a quesadilla/burrito. There wasn't meats like lengua, carne asada, al pastor that can truly be called fusion cuisine. I really liked the complementary cookie that they gave out. Usually it is a Snickerdoodle and a special of the day, which turned out to be a caramel oatmeal raisin, which was pretty damn good.

Overall, I would have liked to give Chino Bandido a 3.5 stars, but since there is no such thing, a three will suffice for now. I think another visit and a completely different combo can either confirm the ratings or show me what I am missing for a higher rating. An interesting note: I must have seen a chinese buffet or restaurant at every block of the 5 miles drive back to the hotel. Chinese is prevalent, but until Ming Tsai or truly authentic Chinese chefs can raise the cuisine bar, Chino Bandido is more than worthy of the fusion crown in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh Chino Bandido, how I want to love you. I mean what's not to like about the idea of blending Asian and Mexican cuisines? This concept should be a home-run. In my imagination, my taste buds tingle with delight at the very thought of all the flavor combinations. However, in reality, eating at Chino Bandidos is far from appetizing.

Besides the decor, which has all the charm of a high school cafeteria, the food is greasy, bland, and lukewarm. I love the idea of eating Fried Rice side-by-side with Refried Beans. However, neither tasted good on their own; so the combination of the two couldn't possibly be good either. Multiply that example across the rest of the food there too. Chino Bandido is a great concept, but the execution of that concept leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"OMG - had the Chinese bbq pork, jade red chicken, refried beans, regular fried rice, watermelon iced tea and volcano cookie. How have I driven by this place so much and never eaten here before? So yummy and delicious! Had to take food home, so the quantities are large. Wish I would have taken a picture of my food."}
{"text":"This is one of those unique places that has taken different types of food and really put them together in a killer way. Combine that with a low key vibe & a bottle of beer. Bring me back ASAP."}
{"text":"Serving up BIG flavor in a little strip mall.  It was our first visit, the girl behind the counter was great...she gave us samples of 6 popular offerings to acquaint us with the menu and then talked us through the order process.  A nice touch for first timers. I ordered the carnitas (savory), jerk chicken and jerk rice (a bit of spicy) and black beans (refried and slightly sweet).  Great combination! I took half of it home for lunch the next day, great bargain at $10.  The staff gets service...even putting a special fold in our bag securing our leftovers (precious cargo!).

We went here on our last night in town, wish we had gone here first! I could have had dinner there more than once.  Next trip to Phoenix, Chino Bandido will be our go to dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times, and usually I'd rate them a 4 out of 5.  Lately, however, it appears that management is never on duty.  They are slow and inattentive.  

I had called ahead with a large party of around 20 people nearly a week in advance, and again a few hours before our alotted time.  Upon arrival, our tables were neatly set aside and marked as reserved.  However, a few cooks didn't show up for work, or management just didn't see the point in having more than two on a Saturday night.  It took an hour for us to get our food.  AN HOUR!

The place was slammed, which is good for them, but we watched as more customers ended up leaving instead of staying and waiting over an hour for their food.  The wait was ridiculous, especially since we arrived at our scheduled time with the number of people we said we would have.  

I've never been to the original Chino Bandido, but apparently this one isn't able to accomodate groups of any size in a reasonable time period.  This was the second time we brought our group to Chino, and I guarantee it was the last."}
{"text":"Definitely good and unique food.  Not sure if it's to die for, but definitely worth eating every now and again!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying this is on our families top restaurant list.  We have come her probably almost once a month or more for 10 years.  But the last half a dozen times the jerk fried rice barely has an jerk chicken in it and the rice itself is mostly white like steamed rather than fried.  The jade red chicken has barely had any sauce on it,  so dry was barely worth eating.  I would have given this place 5 stars every time besides the last about 6 to 8 months.  I hope someone at Chino reads this and adjusts because I really miss the awesome food."}
{"text":"Seriously 4 stars?? I don't get the high rating for this place. Yes the staff is friendly but that's it. It's basically 1 step lower than Panda Express except with a Mexican flair. The different meat options border on tasteless and dry to overly spiced and not in a good way. And the price was way too high considering the quality. The place was crowded though with kids and stoners so that might explain the high ratings. This place was featured on the food network by that blond spiky haired dude so that should have been my first indication how this dining experience would be. Lesson learned.."}
{"text":"Gnarly fast food. The concept is great but the execution is just awful. There was no flavor to the Jade Red Chicken and the tortilla was stale. It wasn't even creative; purely drunk food only that it still leaves you unsatisfied. I can take awful food now and then but the place was completely dirty. There was food left on our table that I had to wipe off and there was food all over the floor. the staff just merrily ignored it. Absolutely disgusting. We came home and showered. If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Love the food here and is extremely customizable.  All the choices are fairly good.  Great place for takeout as you can just fill out the pad drop it off and wait.  Although sometimes depending on how busy it is there can be a bit of a wait.  Also, they have a gluten free menu and are willing to customize those dishes."}
{"text":"As a long time patron of Chino Bandido I have been accustomed to a certain level of quality when it comes to the food. Up until recently that quality has been excellent and it is for that reason alone I am able to give this even 3 stars. I am particularly speaking of this Chandler location. The quality here has been highly inconsistent. When this location first opened (and for months after) the food was actually hot and they certainly did not skimp on anything. Today, I was so disappointed that I had to write about it. The food temperature was lukewarm, at best. The food quantity seemed like it was half of what I had been accustomed to. It was just such a disappointment.

On the positive side I did notice that they have happy hour now so I may have to make my way back to try it out."}
{"text":"Had the jerk fried rice and the milder jerk chicken and it was AMAZING! By far one of the best places I've gotten food in Phoenix its a small location but very very good!"}
{"text":"Restaurant itself just seems dirty and not very well put together. You can see into the kitchen while you're waiting on your food and it was filthy. Just makes you wonder. But I have heard raving reviews about this place so I had to try it. The food was fantastic and so different from anything else. The staff were knowledgable and friendly so that made up for the restaurant being disgusting."}
{"text":"Go here if you... One, want chinese or mexican and cant decide. Two, want a lot of food. Three, aren't on a diet or were and want to break it up in the best/worst way possible. 

First timers, the menu can be confusing, don't waste too much time and just ask for help at the counter."}
{"text":"I wanted to ADORE this place, but I don't.  Other than the black bean and jade chicken, it's just eh.
I might go back if I'm dying for something different, but, it just wasn't all that.  A little greasy if anything.
The cost is super low, so there's that."}
{"text":"Amazing food down to amazing service!!! Definitely going back. My boyfriend and I fell in love the red jade chicken."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! My husband and I got a take out order and were very happy with it. That was probably one of the best chili rellenos I've had. I was disappointed with the veggie salad, however, as it was mostly just lettuce. The black beans were pretty spicy and salty, so plan on having something to mix them with like rice or an extra tortilla. I probably wouldn't dine in if I could help it, the dining room isn't very comfy, (free wifi while you wait for your order is nice, though) but I will definitely be getting more take out! 

Oh, and: a snickerdoodle with every order! A good one, too!"}
{"text":"Mexican and Chinese Fusion? Strange, but awesomely delicious! I wouldn't consider this joint a \"cheap eats\" though. It's about $8.50 a plate.

I ordered 7Q + 10 with JFR
Translation:
Jade Red Chicken in a Quesadilla + Emerald Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice.

Super delicious! I especially enjoyed the quesadilla. The emerald chicken is a mock off a traditional Chinese dish (Tzong Yoh Jee: Green Onion and Oil Chicken). I've definitely had better chicken, but for an American joint, I give it 4 stars for trying. The jerk fried rice is a must try, I absolutely loved it! It has a spicy punch that really hits the spot (the perfect amount of spiciness!)

I didn't sample their items because I was in a rush, but I think it is super awesome that the staff are super friendly and offer samples to their patrons.

I will definitely come again! :)"}
{"text":"If you are interested in highly seasoned, unique, flavorful food, this is THE PLACE. I live in california, and every time my husband and I visit phoenix we have to stop in a couple times before we leave. 

My favorite place to eat hands down. You DO have to know what your getting yourself into though. It is FUSION, that means... KINDA WIERD on the first try stuff. Try to have an open mind."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here because of the great yelp reviews and it totally lived up to the expectation. When we first pulled up I questioned myself because its kind of a dive type place. Bottom line: the food was AMAZING! Probably some of the best stuff I have ever eaten. I don't live anywhere near and am craving it all the time now ;( Will someone mail me some? Ill have their awesome pastor, diablo chicken and jerk rice! thanks."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this. The food here is delicious and almost magical.

I Ordered the Chicken fried rice, with refried beans, Jade red chicken and Teriyaki chicken. It was perfect. The Jade red chicken is perfectly sweetened and damn right delicious. The beans were almost like the one's i grew up eating. This is a must try if you're ever in the phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Great little place here. Ordered on the phone and it was nice and easy. Very affordable as well. Went in to pick up my order. Man this place is busy as heck! Not a bad thing at all though. It was well managed. One fella was taking the orders and two others had registers running and ringing up customers. Its an order your food and sit down place. They bring your food to you though and overall pretty nice inside. The lady infront of me had never been before just like myself. When she got to the man taking the orders he was very knowledgeable about everything and even had samples for her to try of the common combos they sell. Great customer service in my book. 
As for my order, it was amazing. I ordered a combo meal with pollo diablo, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans. Also the combos come with a cookie. The meal itself was amazing. I can see why the jade red chicken is a fan favorite its really got a great flavor. The pollo diablo is definitely not for the tenderfoot. I love spicy food though and this one was a must, love the garlic. The jerk fried rice was great i wasnt expecting actual jerk chicken in it and i was happily surprised to find it mixed in. Alright, so as for the best part about it.... the beans!!! Omg i've never had beans like this in my life. So creamy with such an amazing texture. Loved the black beans. And also, i cant remember if the cookies are home-made or what, but best snickerdoodle I've ever had in my whole life. 

Overall great place. I cant wait to try more of their menu items because some of them look great."}
{"text":"I can remember eating at Chino Bandido ever since I was a kid. I always went to the original location on the west side on Greenway. My favorite has always been the Jade Red Chicken, Egg Foo Young, and Chile Relleno. The black beans are also my beans of choice. If you manage to be at the restaurant when they're serving the volcano cookies, consider yourself lucky. I've always hoped I'd be there when they serve those but I always end up with the snickerdoodles. Which are good as well, but the volcano cookies are wayyy better."}
{"text":"I live on the opposite side of town so whenever I'm even remotely in the area I try and stop by and get my Chino fix.. The food is delicious.. I always go for the same thing: carnitas in a quesadilla, jade chicken with black beans and jerk fried rice. Oh so good! This place is awesome; one awesome thing they do is for newbies they give you a taste if everything so you can decide what you want.. Also you always get a snicker doodle cookie! I love Chino!"}
{"text":"They force you into the Million calorie combo.  A rice bowl is not quite enough and by time you add bans its just $..30 more for the big combo.

I finally got a chance to come back in here, I did a to go order for lunch. It was made quickly. I still have no idea how to fill out the order sheet, and despite the a sign on the door saying the use that sheet in the kitchen. 

As usual my food was great as it should be with all of the cheese and fried bits. 

The hot sauce lacked some of the sweetness that I usually like, the color was even off  bit this time.

I was beyond full after this meal, it made me contemplate picking up bulimia."}
{"text":"Looks like a cafeteria. Cheap plastic tables and a printed paper menu on the wall. I was scared to eat there and walked out. They must have paid for ratings"}
{"text":"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Even better service!!!  Salute. I had the Jen Red Pork with fried rice and black beans.....AMAZING"}
{"text":"I do love Chino, however, I am taking off a couple of stars because the last few times I have gone there, the food didnt seem very fresh but was till tasty. I love the pork fried rice (some of the best fried rice Ive ever had, kinda sweet from the BBQ pork in it), the black beans (some of the best black beans Ive ever had) the jade red chicken and the carnita's quesadilla's. The BBQ Sweet pork is pretty good as well. And the snickerdoodles cookies and chocolate volcano cookies are da bomb. A couple dishes I am not impressed with at Chino: The egg foo young, the chili relleno (had crushed saltines on it which I was not keen on), and the gringo chicken (kinda dry and bland). 
The price is decent although it recently went up. The owners are the nicest people and the staff is always pretty friendly. The decor and ambiance is a little strange with the folding tables, cheap chairs and not much decor on the walls. However, I was told by the owner at one point that they keep it that way so they can keep the food and everything cheaper. They have been improving on this lately with painting the walls and tiling in the crappy little round putting green that was by the backdoor. 
I still like this place very much. Here is a story to tell you how much I like Chino. One time, I got water from the drink dispenser. I was sitting there stirring it around with my straw when I noticed something. Upon further inspection, it was a dead cricket. Pretty dam gross. I was disgusted that I didnt go back to Chino for about a year. Then I started to miss it. So I went back, just dont get a drink anymore. Haha. I do wish that I could go there again and have the food be fresh and wonderful like it once was. Its still good though and I will still go when I get my occasional chino craving. After all, \"eat chino, live forever!\""}
{"text":"I've heard so many phenomenal things about this restaurant. Friends and family rave about how awesome the concept is, and how great the food is. One day, I drove out of the way from where I live to come try this place out. Needless to say I was very excited. Unfortunately that excitement ended the minute I waited in line to order. The cashier who was working at 3:30pm April 19th was insanely rude. The guy in front me pointed on a picture near the cash register and said he wanted his meal exactly like this. The cashier was very short with him, and kept asking him what he wanted. They finally figured it out, and he customer apologized for not knowing exactly what he wanted. He payed and was told in a very short and rude tone \"Go sit over there. We will bring it you you.\"

Now it was my turn to order. I said I wanted the combination plate with the quesadilla and burrito. The cashier told me \"Ok, what do you want.\" I again said the the burrito and quesadilla with beans and rice. Once again, he was insanely rude once again. \"Yeah, again, what do you want\". I was so confused. Being this was my first time in, I wasn't sure the best way to order. He goes, \"You get two items, what items do you want\". Again I had no idea what he was talking about and expected I would be told what items I could chose from. NOPE! Nothing but attitude and poor customer service. He was so rude, I at this point refused to give my money to such a disrespectful person, so I left and sadly ended up going to jack and a box. Something I for sure I didn't want to have. 

I was so bummed and upset by the lack of customer service I was receiving from this poor cashier. If I was his employer, I would be embarrassed and ashamed by this guy. I've worked in food and beverage for 9 years, and I know how good customer service is given. And this man was by far he rudest person I have dealt with in ANY established.  This employee should be fired as he represented this company so badly. I don't know if I will try this place out after having such a poor taste in my mouth before even taking a bite out of the food."}
{"text":"This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food."}
{"text":"My cousin and I were having trouble with picking what to eat and we just so happen to find this place! It's a little confusing when you first walk in but the employees are happy to guide along. Furthermore, you receive your food in about 5 mins (2 people). The food was enriching with its \"volcano\" cookie as well, very soft!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.    Best hole in the wall joint around.  Flavor outrageous!  Mish mash fusion....Chinese food...mexican food.... cuban food.... yum."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat for like twenty years now. Jade red chicken rice bowl with watermelon ice tea. Perfect."}
{"text":"Had to wait 20 minutes longer than people that ordered after me. Customer service is terrible, not the first time this has happened. The man at the counter was vary rude."}
{"text":"NASTYYYYYYYYY. Im sorry if you like this place but the food was just nasty. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken and it. Was. Bland. As. Fudge. At least the chicken fried rice wasn't half as bad, but still, had barely any flavor. Food was greasy and probably more calories than you should be eating in one sitting. I mean seriously? More rice than actual meat? There was like 2 cups of rice and 1/2 cup of meat. Like, sir I wanted protein not carbs but whatever. I guess if you're the type of person to just grab and go, this is perfect for you. If not, I recommend getting your ass outta here and into a proper asian fusion place or just Mexican or Asian restaurant. As far as a person who loves to eat healthy, for me this place is probably somewhere I would never go again. But the guy at the cashier was pretty friendly so yeah. That star is for him because he was a good kid like in pre-k."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites!  I would call it cheap Mexican/Asian fusion food.  Portions are huge.  As if they do not give you enough food, they also include a cookie along with the meal.  After finishing, I usually have left overs for a meal or two.  To date, I have yet to try anything I haven't liked here.

The biggest downside is the wait.  Come before you are actually hungry because it always takes a while for you food to come out."}
{"text":"Now this is an interesting concept.

I've seen this place for years, but never stopped by. I always wondered, how do you mix Chinese and Mexican cuisine? Exactly as you would imagine: by putting Chinese meat in a tortilla and serving beans on the side.

It was surprisingly delicious. They took us through a tasting of their most popular items (a HUGE plus in my book) and explained the ordering system. It was so hard to choose, and I felt rushed with a line forming behind us. I ended up with a combo - shredded beef quesadilla and Jade Red chicken burrito, with black beans. The Jade Red chicken is their most popular dish, and it was really good. Sweet and a little spicy. The shredded beef quesadilla didn't have much in the way of Chinese flair, but it was delicious nonetheless.

Everything was as amazing as the 100+  Yelp reviews made it out to be.

But there was SO MUCH FOOD. So much. I don't think I was even able to eat half. Very greasy as well, but would you expect anything less from a Chinese-Mexican combo? The icing on the cake: COOKIES. mmm. Every combo comes with a cookie, which was a fantastic surprise.

Overall, this food was really good and an amazing value. I could probably get three meals out of an $8 combo! Not something I could eat once a week (for fear of gaining ten pounds each time), but it will be a delightfully greasy treat now and then."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 9 years now. The food is great. It is kind of a dive, and the ordering is a little weird, but the food totally makes up for it.

They blend Mexican and Chinese food. The machaca rice bowl with plain fried rice is my fav!

Good place to eat. Try to stay clear on Sunday afternoons though. Once the huge church up the street lets out, that place is packed. There is usually at least a 30 minute line when that happens."}
{"text":"I could not help but the Chinese/Mexican food posting on the sign in front and had to try it out.  The menu has a great variety of Chinese and Mexican inspired menu items.  I had the Jamaican Jerk chicken which was hot and spicy and actually tasted the way that it does in Jamaica!

The fried rice has options - brown, chicken or pork.

The staff is friendly and will even give you samples before ordering.

In addition, each meal comes with a cookie.

The place is a dive, but you cannot go wrong with it."}
{"text":"I went there because it looked like a fun place.
After practicing filling out their crazy menu online I dragged the hubster and a few other relatives. The Jade Chicken was fantastic, but nothing else notable.
Cinnamon hockey puck? Thumbs up.

I might go again if I crave the chicken. Maybe takee outee next time :)"}
{"text":"Saw a re-run of ddd  which featured CB. I have been her many time before but not quite awhile. Decided to make a busy. I was not disappointed. Had a combo. Was a delicious as ever. Did was pipping hit and service was excellent. Even say the owner and she was kind and made sure that the order was correct. Glad to see she is still there making she the place is up to her standards.  

The food really hit the spot. Was exactly like I remember. Maybe even a bit better that in the past."}
{"text":"A dive that serves a variety of great foods! So, who would have thought the combinations of Mexican and Asian flavors would pair well? We were skeptical at first until one of the boys at the counter started dishing out samples to us. The ordering process is a bit tricky at first but, thankfully, the staff are friendly and walk you through it. 

There has not been one entree I haven't enjoyed. And the jade chicken. YUM!"}
{"text":"Asian and Mexican- what move can I say? I love this place and the unique dishes they serve up. I've never had a bad combination but my boyfriend got sick once so we haven't went back. Great employees who will explain how to order and even give samples! The best part is you get a snickerdoodle with every meal."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the greatest and most unique 'hole-in-the-wall'/local dive to grace the streets of Arizona. 

Don't knock it 'til you've tried it...because after you've tried it, you won't be able to knock it :)"}
{"text":"Ugggghh, what can I say about Chino Bandido...

It's a shit hole on 19th and greenway in a dumpy shopping center.

The food isn't really that good, and the place is not clean.
My friend raved about this place, so I went with him... I even ordered his suggestion, some chicken bowl thing.  The chicken was grizzly and the serving wasn't even that big for what I dropped.  

I think the idea of the place is cute, but the execution isn't there.  I mean, a filiberto's or a cheap chinese joint destroy this place, and you could buy a burrito and a chinese combo at both together for only a few dollars more than a combo at Chino Bandito.

I just do not understand why people like this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place after watching a rerun of diners drive-ins & dives. The order process was overwhelming but the guy behind the counter helped us out. The food was good, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese Mexican fusion restaurant. Must get is their Emerald Chicken and Jade Red Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans. Can come in a rice bowl, burrito, or quesadilla."}
{"text":"Really great food at very reasonable prices.  Had the diablo chicken which was outstanding. They even allow you to sample the dishes before you order."}
{"text":"Finally made it in after hearing about Chino Bandido for years.  Fun place.  Order at the counter to the left, then cop a squat in the dining area(s) to the right and they'll bring your food out to you.  Bonus for first-timers: they provide meat samples to help you make your order.  I had a 2-item combo (jade red chicken and carnitas) and jerk fried rice.  I should have gone with 1 item instead as I'm still stuffed and lunch was an hour ago!

So the place isn't earth-shattering, but it was good.  I'll be back and I'll have no problem recommending Chino Bandido to anyone who'll listen."}
{"text":"Totally unique combination of Mexican and Asian food.

The food is reasonable, but it is mediocre Mexican or Asian as solo fare.  Combined it is unique enough to want to come back to explore more variety.

It definitely has a charm that is hard to articulate.

More than anything it is FABULOUS for large groups.  Beyond accommodating.  This is one of those must try at least one time restaurants."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Food Network so decided to try it when in town. Ordered the red jade chicken and fried rice. The place was packed with loud redneck hicks with no manners...thought I was on Honey Boo Boo. As for the food...it was ok. It would have been better if it was made to order which mine seemed to be reheated. Youre not missing  much here...even if I was a local I doubt I would come back."}
{"text":"it's like a Mexican panda express. so much yes."}
{"text":"Wanna Try something unique and different...this is the place. The black refried beans and jerk rice are fabulous!"}
{"text":"I have a couple friends who love this place,  and in theory it should be good  (mexican chinese fusion just sounds fantastic!)  but in practice... meh.   

the cheap lawn furniture I don't mind too much except it's impossible to keep clean,  so every table always looks a little dirty whether it's been wiped down or not.    

The food itself.. a little too greasy and salty for me.  Sorry to have to say it that way but when I choose what to buy with my dollar I'm going to choose something less greasy and less salty.  

The location is a bit hard to find,   in the back corner of an off-the-corner strip mall.    That's awkward but I guess only bad the very first time, once you know where it is you know.  

The ordering process is weird and unique but not in a good way.    I always find myself kinda wondering why it has to be more complicated than \"I WOULD LIKE THIS AND THAT, HERE IS MONEY, THANK YOU\"

So what do I like?   Well the prices are pretty good,   and they usually hook you up with a free cookie or two.   Those kick ass,  all soft and melty!    And the portions will not leave you hungry,   unless you've got a monster appetite!    

I go here when my friends suggest it,  it's OK food... but not a place I'd go on my own or one I'd suggest to people.      If they streamlined the ordering process,   refined their recipes to emphasize freshness and less fried/greasy stuff,    and invested in more inviting dining area furniture I'd probably like them a lot more!"}
{"text":"This place is hillarious. From the panda with the mustache to the plastic tables and fold up chairs. I hope you're not looking for high end dining in terms of ambiance! But the food is worth walking inside the small hole in the wall restaurant. The jade red chicken is amazing. I recommend it plain (as in not in a burrito/quesadilla). My other favorite is the jerk chicken (which is a little spicy) in a quesadilla. Oh and the black beans are good too. 

Don't forget you get a cookie with the combo! I love snickerdoodles.

YUM!"}
{"text":"OK... so the red jade pork and black beans rock. Otherwise, the place is a mess. .

I get the iconic nature of the restaurant and the large following it has a result. In fact, I would say that eating here at least once is a must. Twice? Maybe not."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but every time I get the chance to stop in I get the black beans, jerk rice, and jade chicken. It's so delicious. I wish there was a Chino Bandido closer to me!!!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb...interesting combinations you can mix and match. I had the chile relleno, Egg Foo young, Jerk fried rice and imperial chicken which is fantastic. The ordering process not that bad if you just ask someone"}
{"text":"Totally lived up to the hype! Service was fantastic and friendly. Especially love that they take the time to offer samples to newbies. Even with a growing line-up, we never felt rushed to place our order and got to taste bits of the menu. 

If you're not familiar with jerk chicken seasoning, be warned that it has an extra spicy kick. Scotch Bonnet heat is different than other chillies. The cashier suggested adding it to a quesadilla, to mellow out the heat, and we took her up on the spot-on recommendation. Plus melted cheese just makes everything better anyway. As mentioned in other reviews, the black beans are also phenomenal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the Valley.  This is the original and the best.  While I miss their East Valley location, it is worth the trek across town to eat their delicious mix of Mexican and Asian dishes just North of 19th Ave. and Greenfield.

It is a great place to bring visitors.  They'll wonder if you lost your mind when they see the simple decor - folding tables and chairs - but then they'll thank you once they've tasted their food.

I'd suggest multiple visits to mix things up.  I usually get the Jade Red Chicken and switch up my other entree choice but cannot get away from the black beans and the jerk fried rice.  My second most favorite entree would have to be the Jerk Fried Chicken.  So good.

Others have already explained the ordering process, so I won't go into that any more other than to say - if it is your first visit, make sure to let them know and take part in their sampling process.

The employees are friendly and helpful and the food is unique and delicious.

Give it a try and you'll be back.  Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant, well worth the price. It's not five star quality food, but it is definitely above average, and the staff is great. In fact, if it's your first time there, let them know and they'll give you a bunch of samples. I was sold instantly. Been there a few times now and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken and emerald chicken is my go to and of course the jerk fried rice!!!"}
{"text":"We have heard about this place for a long time from friends and family. Everybody loves it!
My questions is WHY? Why the hype? Is it because of Guy Fieri?
My husband and I are very adventurous foodies. We are also very creative cooks. 
This was not good Mexican food. This was not good Chinese food. Get the two together and it was horrible food. Truly the worst food we have ever had in the valley! I think people are going for it cuz its trendy! Pleeeease!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty rude. They rush you when you fill out the paper and aren't very friendly. Not very welcoming. Portions were irregular as well. Not as good as the last times I visited and won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Just because you say fusion doesn't mean you have good food, in fact Chino Bandido took cheap Mexican food and cheap Chinese food and serves it in the same establishment. It is a complete dive, which is the only reason that I can image Guy Fieri would like it. It isn't even worth going once for the experience, and if you must bring the Pepto Bismol with you, you will be sick afterwards. The service is excellent, top notch for a place where you order at the counter (and they use white mean chicken, which is a plus for me), but the food is so terrible, that I can't give it more than 1 star."}
{"text":"Ok the place is gross like really really disgusting but the food including the cookie ( that comes with the meal) is AMAZING!!! It's a crazy mix, a crazy delicious mix don't miss out because it's in a creepy spot just make sure u park your car close to the window and lock your doors : ) it's not really that bad!"}
{"text":"We love this place and it has become one of our favorites! I highly recommend it! My favorite is the carnitas quesidillas, jerk fried rice,  and black beans."}
{"text":"My boyfriend knows that I hate to go out to Mexican food because I'm never satisfied but he dragged me here anyways.

The guy at the counter was really helpful.  He asked if it was our first time and let us try everything on the menu first and explained what it was. He kind of made a big deal when I told him that I couldn't have pork and said no thank you to the samples of them. It was really embarrassing for me and unprofessional on his part. 

The food was good though. I mean hmmm...it was good for chinese mexican food. I'm not sure if I liked it that much but it the idea of chinese mexican just didn't sit well with me. 

The restaurant itself was nice and the atmosphere was good too. Very laid back. I liked that feeling. Just not my thing I guess. It also gave me a stomachache"}
{"text":"Check your to go order, they announce your name, I asked if they had everything in there and was told yes.  You can't look into the to go containers and of course it was all wrong."}
{"text":"VERY interesting idea!  and a deliciously good idea too!

Favorites: Emerald chicken quesadilla and Jerk fried rice.

The place isn't spectacular to look at and you grab your own utensils and bus your own table.  But they do have funny photos on the wall that look photo-shopped to show a Mexican person with a Chinese person.  I kind of want to ask about that next time."}
{"text":"Wow has this place lost it's touch!  Getting run down.  Trash all over the floors.  Tables not wiped down.  Dirty rag left by the soda fountain.  Went on Sunday afternoon on the way home from Turf Paradise, which is just up the road.  The place was crowded.  Got a two item combo (one green chicken + one red chicken) and a bottom-less soft drink for about $11.  Waited almost 15 minutes for my order - and the food arrived at room temperature and tasted like it had been sitting around.  How can you fail to serve heated food?  My chicken items were dried out.  The accompanying black beans were literally a puree with a few (unmelted) flakes of shredded cheese.  Your meal is served in a circular tin - mine arrived as basically an unappetizing room temp mess.  At least the soda is bottom-less and the meal came with a decent freebie sugary cookie (at least the cookie was somewhat warm).  This place is a mere shadow of former greatness...  Need to find a new haunt after the track!"}
{"text":"The Mexican-Asian fusion concept is perfect and Chino does it best! I've never actually tried that combination except for here and it's truly life changing. You have plenty of different options for meats and you can never go wrong with any of them. You get rice, beans, mean (quesadilla/burrito), and a cookie all for less than $10. The meal is very filling as well. The beans are delish and they come with a little cheese on top. The rice has meat in it too and you can choose a different meat from the one in your burrito/quesadilla. This place really lets you choose what you want, and the cookie is a nice compliment as well. The seating area is a little outdated but the food completely makes up for it! The employees are also very helpful with filling out the order form. The only thing I would change is the dining area, and the overall look inside. It has a cafeteria type of look to it. Nonetheless, this place is amazing and it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"My favorite place is Arizona! Such an amazing combination of Chinese and Mexican food.  The jade red chicken is to die for.  Their teriyaki chicken is so unique, very delicious.  Any time a friend or family member visits, we have to take them here.  They let you sample a lot on your first visit, sometimes I still say it's my first time lol"}
{"text":"The Mexican asian infusion here is AWESOME! I always call in my order and they have it ready within 10 minutes. The food is always hot and fresh and ready to be devoured. The restaurant part of this place isn't all that fancy and honestly... I don't ever eat here but always take it home. 
Customer service is pretty straight forward. They don't smile much, but also don't bite your head off either. Their prices went up this last year... which didn't make me happy but, the food quality is pretty good so, I'll take it I guess. 
They have flavors for everyone! Spicy, mild, sweet... and the kids meals are perfect for anyone under 7! It's a very small bowl!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A mix of Chinese and Mexican!! Picked up food to go! #14 is extra good and the Red Jade Chicken in a quesadilla is amazing!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here, because who isn't curious about the fusion of chinese food with mexican wrapped in a burrito or melted in a quesadilla? Well, it was interesting to eat for sure. The service is pretty good, very friendly, and if it's your first time, which is was for us, they give a sample of part of their menu (beans, red jade chicken, chicken with ginger, chicken fried rice, shredded pork, and jerk chicken was thrown in since we were curious)

I got the egg foo young with no meat in a burrito and added regular fried rice to mine. It was pretty small, definitely not a chipotle sized serving of a burrito and slightly greasy (oil dripping out the tortilla when I took a bite greasy), but it was tasty. My friend got the chile relleno with the side of beans and the quesadilla with the gringo chicken, which she thought was ok. I think we kind of enjoyed our samples more. 

It surprisingly had a lot of seating inside and the decor is also a fusion of mexican and chinese culture with chili peppers dangling from the wall and tsing tao ads/chinese new year lanterns hanging from the ceiling. I would probably come back to try the meat dishes since the red jade chicken was a spiced up version of sweet and sour chicken and the jerk chicken fried rice was good. I think I might have gotten a stomach ache from it though."}
{"text":"Four stars for the concept alone -- Asian/Mexican fusion? YUM. It was delicious, unassuming, and did I say delicious? Pollo diablo was nice and warm (not overly hot), and Pancho is a friendly fella. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different. Chino Bandido is the best place to go. Mainly because you can have a mixture between Chinese and Mexican food. And who wouldn't want that when you come to Arizona. I always try to get a burrito mixed with some kind of a Chinese cuisine. And their cookies are just absolutely phenomenal. Their snickerdoodles I've never had any snickerdoodle cookies as good as they have it. Restaurants been there for a while it's been on featured on some TV shows was kind of skeptical because of the mixture of food but once you get in and you actually pick a different set you can either do a bowl or burrito.  phenomenon. Food and the people are very helpful"}
{"text":"\"Fusion\" cuisine, well conceived and artfully produced, is usually an expensive endeavor.  Chino is a blessed exception.

In some sense, it is not fusion, per se.  They have traditional Chinese dishes (Teriyaki chicken, jen red pork) and traditional Mexican dishes (machaca, chile relleno).  But carnitas in a rice bowl, jerk chicken in a burrito, and jade chicken in a quesadilla are not your everyday street fare either.

The payoff is in the attention to detail.  I don't love all of their recipes, but I love a lot of them.  Everything is spiced well (pollo diablo!) and the ownership takes a lot of pride in the quality of the food.

All this and it's called a \"Takee-Outee\".  Needless to say, pretty low-brow.

My favorite new development: the Chandler location has FREE WIRELESS.  I love you, Chino.

Eat at Chino's, Live Forever."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I miss this place. It's been maybe almost 2 years since I have been here. I want to say I had something African jerky something. I really don't remember what I had here. I live kinda far from here so I don't get to come here like at all. Unless I made the drive out here. I really want to though. It's a smaller place. But the food is a mix of Asian with Mexican or something of the sort. It's literally the perfect combination. Unfortunately I don't remember a lot so I'm gonna have to come here again soon! But go try this place!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place.  We planned it out for today.  We arrived about 11:45.  Perfect timing because right after we got there, it filled up.  When we pulled into the parking lot, quite frankly I was alarmed.  Not what I expected.  Total dive and not inviting at all from the outside.  But we decided to go in anyway.  The young man behind the counter was very welcoming and helpful.  Offered us tastes and answered all of our questions.  I decided on a combination plate of white rice, hengrenade chicken, black bean tostada and black beans, and my partner had chicken fried rice, jade chicken burrito, refried beans and teriyaki chicken.  

We went to get our drinks and plastic forks and packets of soy sauce and salt then sat down.  the food came our fairly fast and the employee was very nice.  The food was pretty good.  My chicken was very good, the tostadas were great and you can't go wrong with white rice.  The Cuban black beans were probably my favorite.  My partner fell in love with her jade chicken burrito.  The chicken fried rice was delicious and the refried beans were good too.  The teriyaki chicken was nice and moist, but the teriyaki sauce was not hot and it was poured over the top of a pile of chicken.  It was not bad, but had too much of a ginger flavor four our taste.  

The décor is quite lacking, and nothing to write home about, but it was not dirty.  Just old and bland.  

We are excited to bring our daughters here to try it.  Over all, we are glad we found this place.  We will try many other things they have."}
{"text":"I love their carnitas burritos, and their black beans!
YUM

This food is weird, greasy, and very addictive.  

My boyfriend hates it though, so I guess its not for everybody."}
{"text":"I grew up in the neighborhood and for some reason I thought Chino Bandido was a buffet. I was way off! I can't believe I waited so long to eat here but I am a little worried about my addiction to their chile relleno burrito. I think Chino Bandido made a deal with the devil when they created the best chile relleno ever! Its not your average chile relleno made with an egg its more like a giant jalepeno popper. I get it every time I come here with a veggie quesadilla and top it off with their yummy salsa. I am also obsessed with the snickerdoodle cookies and I don't really like cookies. The ordering system is kind of weird but if you act like its your first time there they'll just fill it out for you ;)"}
{"text":"Chino is always an experience.   It's always fun to watch new people try to figure out how to order at Chino.  If you are going for lunch on a weekday...get there early. 

I personally think there is too much hype over Chino.  The food is just \"ok\".  It's nothing to rave over in my opinion.   The complimentary cookie is a nice touch though.

The machaca quesadilla is my favorite.  Jade Red Chicken is good too.  

They raised their prices not too long ago and now I don't go there so often."}
{"text":"Went to this place because I saw it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and wasn't impress.  The place is a dive but what was more challenging was the menu and how they serve their food.  Seemed very unorganized.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"They got my lunch take out order wrong and I didn't realize it until I'd returned back at work.  The flavors didn't sit with me but I've only tried one dish.  My co-workers rave about it so I'll keep an open mind, hey - everybody has a bad day, right?

Oh Yeah, Guy Fieri is not someone I consider reputable."}
{"text":"FINALLY! 
I was able to have the Chino Bandido experience! I have been wanting to eat here for a while. I just happened to be in the area, so I had to stopped by this historic place!

First, when you walk in, you have the wall!! All of the press clippings, picture of Guy, and awards! Basically just bragging about yourself! Hey! If you're good enough, then you can back it up! And Chino Bandido can back it up! 

After you read all of the bragging rights on the wall, you walk in to the order area with a deer in front of the headlights look! They already know, they will direct you to their tasting station. Give you samples of their food. After you got a taste of their menu, the planning begins! 

I ordered:

Jerk rice, cuban black beans, Jen red pork, and chinese bbq pork. Now you have an option. You can have this Plain! Everything on the plate, or in a burrito, or in a quesadilla! I chose the quesadilla way. Now, i'm not going to lie! I had my thoughts about this! Fusing two kinds of food this way? And better yet, two of the most fattening foods? Before I get into details about their food, I wanted to say that their cuban black beans is the best! And I have had good black beans, heck my father in-law was from Cuba! My Jen Red Pork was in a quesadilla, and that was amazing. Then the mixture of the Jerk Fried rice, black beans, and the Chinese BBQ Pork! I did not expect this, this was one of the best place I have ever had! Boy am I glad I do not live near by! (I would be in a lot of trouble!) 

Their dining room is spacious, nothing special, but not needed. I had a great experience here. Not saying that everyone would like it. Remember, we all have a different taste. But looking at their reviews, it looks like they are doing really well."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. The food was really good. The lady that took my order was very helpful in explaining the menu choices, and offered a taste of any of the meat choices. My only complaint is the dinning area. Fold up plastic tables and plastic chairs  and it needed some clean up. At least you have the option to take your order to go."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is not the restaraunt to go to if you are looking for a healthy meal or excellent tableside service.  However, the staff is always polite and offering samples of their diverse menu is the norm.    The food is Chinese and Mexican (it goes together better than you'd think) and while the options are limited in some ways (A Chinese place without Chow Mein?) for the most part the food is very good, albeit a little greasy.  

Any of the entree items can be had by itself, placed in a quesadilla, or wrapped as a buritto.   Beans and various  kinds of fried rice are offered with the main combo and the range of diversity means that you can probably find something you like, regardless of the mood you're in.  

If you are looking for a place that is a little different, and aren't particularly concerned about fine dining, this is the place to go.  It can get a little crowded during the lunch and dinner rushes though as it is quite popular."}
{"text":"Chinese/Mexican fusion? How can you go wrong? Food was very good, although the menu can be confusing for a first timer, but the staff is there to help, and will make suggestions. Not a fancy place, gets busy at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Rice is rock hard.   Jaded chicken taste like its been sitting there for days.  Brought it to the young girls attention and they had to say was oh.  Plenty of people eating here but maybe they didn't get the rice?
I think I may have just come to
Late and there menu is to big for them to make it fresh when they order it.   Oh well. Plus they give you free chips and salsa for a good review on this.  Reason for all the stars on here? You decided but don't say I didn't warn you.    Maybe there chips are good and worth the stars.  Guess I'll never know"}
{"text":"Fresh fast different good! Added black beans to veggie quesadilla to bulk up - delicious! Check out the funny tees."}
{"text":"A couple of friends told me to check this place out. Chinese/Mexican sounded kinda gross to me, but gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did. It's the best food! I love the jerk fried rice with the Korean barbecue black beans. I get the emerald chicken in a burrito and the red jade chicken in the quesadilla. Bomb! You also get a snicker doodle cookie with your meal. Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are craving something a little different then come here.  It's an Asian Mexican mix and the portions are large.  You pick your meat and your style. Example I like the machaca beef in the burrito style and the emerald chicken in a quesadilla.  They will offer you samples of anything you wish to try.  In fact they have the sampling table up front and ready they encourage you to try a little of everything.   

They will come around every so often and hand out free fresh baked snickerdoodle cookie. They are really yummy!   

This is a great place for groups to go in and eat or for take out."}
{"text":"I really like this crazy mashup of a place. When I first heard of crossing Chinese food and Mexican I was a bit skeptical. In end the food actually comes out really good I'm huge fan of machaca and the red Jade chicken both of which a flavor packed, I had the spicy diablo chicken the other day which has heat and flavor. 

It's fun to try different mashups with burritos and quesadilla's and the different ingredients. So far I think the Diablo Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla are the best and a red jade burrito is the way to go. You can always ask to try something before you order and the staff is happy to help you figure all the choices out.

I always get the black beans and jerk fried chicken since those are amazing the rice is probably the most flavorful rice I have had.

The combo deal is a great value too as it is a lot of food for a single sitting but works well for a meal and a snack especially if you do what i do and get 1 entree plain and the other in a burrito or quesadilla. Plus they give you a good cinnamon sugar cookie with everything.

This location is also much bigger than the phoenix one and seems like you get in and out faster but it is hard to find. If you are there and looking for it it's tucked back behind some trees sort of hidden from the rest of the shopping center.

If you like mexican and Chinese or trying sort of off the wall mixing of the two this place is for you."}
{"text":"Jade Red Chicken!! That should say it all. The foods great, the folks are very friendly, and well thats all there is! Its a nice little place, almost always busy because they are nice like that! 

Terry E said it best, and so go read that review for I cannot top it no matter how hard I may try !"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix from the Bay Area, my co-worker based out there took a couple of us on this 15 minute drive and ended up at this small strip mall.  He kept on telling us that you'll love this place!  We finally got to the restaurant, Chino Bandido?!?  WTF!  Once inside they take the new visitors off to the side to try 8 of their most popular items.  The place is Chinese meets Mexican with a Caribbean flair to it.  It is confusing when it comes to ordering, but the staff is willing to help with any questions.  Basically, you can take any item and throw it on the side, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  The prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get.  I recommend the Carnitas and the Jerk Chicken.  It was weird that you can see chopsticks next to salsa at the condiment area."}
{"text":"I been going to this restaurant for a few years now, I like the concept and the flavor of the Jade Red Chicken and there black beans but I'm just surprised that they still don't have white chicken meat as an option. The staff is always friendly and restaurant looks poor but clean"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a restaurant! It's tucked behind the Walgreens at Dobson & Chandler, and boasts a very large, casual dining room with enough space for big parties/families.

The menu is an interesting assortment of Mexican & Asian spiced meats, about 5 rice options, either refried beans or Cuban black beans, and each of our meals came with a big snickerdoodle or chocolate cookie.

There were 6 of us, we sampled one another's meals, loved everything! Examples: Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Hengrenade Chicken, Chinese BBQ Pork, Machaca.

Chino Bandido's is a MUST-TRY place. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"NOTORIETY: Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives (Jade Red Chicken, Machaca, Pollo Diablo)

WHAT TO EXPECT:  Their individualized combo menu is a bit confusing.  I suggest asking them for an explanation.

FOOD:  The food is might tasty.  For the combo, you can make any of the meats into a quesadilla or burrito and it comes w/ the typical rice & beans of Mexican restaurants but w/ a twist (i.e. chicken fried rice or jerk chicken fried rice).  I def. recommend the black beans, which they mash and tastes like nothing I've ever had before (in a good way).

OVERALL:  I had my initial hesitation about this place, but the food tastes amazing.  I try to drop by this place every time I stop in Phoenix b/c of the flavors & very reasonable price for the amount of food given."}
{"text":"This has been my husband and I's favorite restaurant for more than 15 years....you have to know how to order.  We are Q9, 7, black bean with white rice fans.  We are loyal to the Phoenix location.  The Snickerdoodle cookies are the best recipe you will ever eat for this cookie.....guaranteed.  Thanks for so many years of memories and great food!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this in over 2 years (due to moving out of state) but someone mentioned it earlier today and I haven't stopped thinking about it. 

I recall always getting a carnitas quesadilla and jade red chicken lunch special. The black beans are OUT OF THIS WORLD. I tried many times to recreate them but have been unsuccessful every time.

If you have questioned this place - stop it and go to it. Yeah it's in a dirty ass strip mall but who cares. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm Chinese. I eat Chinese food all the time. Is this Chinese food? Hell no! Do I care?! HELL NO!!! This place is a godsend.

I ordered the Jade chicken with a stuffed bellpepper and jerk fried rice. All I can say was - AMAZING. It's not a gourmet or luxurious meal that you get, but as a comfort fast food, man was it delicious!! Don't think of it as Chinese food. Think of it as heavenly food."}
{"text":"Amazing different fusion food! Loved it! Sous definitely come back and try something else. Always busy but staff is very friendly and plenty of seating available."}
{"text":"Great family owned business with delicious food!  And when you come for your first time, tell them you're a \"newbie\" and they let you sample all the dishes!"}
{"text":"The Red Jade Chicken and Pork Quesadilla were good but the Pork Fried Rice was forgettable. Cookies were OK, but what do you want for free? Counter person was quick to offer help in how to order and a free sample of meat."}
{"text":"Every now and then, it's nice to cast better judgement aside and indulge in some unique, local fare. That's what I did today, and I'm glad I did - at least so far! At first glance, Chino Bandido looks like a pretty pedestrian Mexican restaurant, just another divey, strip-mall eatery among countless others spread across the Phoenix landscape. But they are decidedly unique. Instead of stuffing their burritos with carne asada or refried beans or shredded chicken, they fill their tortillas with the likes of Chinese BBQ pork, Jamaican jerk chicken and Egg Foo Yoo. What!!? All of there offerings are served either as rice bowls, quesadillas, or burritos. Turn your order into a combo and you get beans (black or refried) and rice (cooked one of 4 different ways).

I opted for the two burrito combo with jerk chicken and chinese pork. Now, I've been here before and sometimes the burritos are on the small side. Not so today. I'm not sure if it's because I ordered in the late afternoon instead of in the middle of their lunch rush, but these burritos were huge! The chinese pork was just the right combination of sweet and savory. The jerk chicken was packed with flavor and had a nice mellow burn to it. The combo was served with black beans (decent) and jerk fried rice (amazing). Oh, and instead of a fortune cookie, you get a snickerdoodle. Not my thing, but pretty delicious. All this for around $9!!

Now, here are a couple of things to note:

1. Yes, the place is pretty dumpy. It's located in a rough-looking strip mall. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and this definitely fell in the \"Dives\" category. The dining room is pretty non-descript - a bunch of plastic folding tables crammed into two rooms. 

2. Surprisingly, the restrooms are really nice - clean and modern. They must've just remodeled them (at least the men's room), because it's the nicest part of the restaurant. How often can you say that?

3. Ok, so I have a degree in engineering but I feel pretty stupid every time I order here. They have these forms that you're supposed to fill out that are less than intuitive. I'm sure if I were a regular, I would get the hang of it. The good news is that they have a friendly staff eager to help.

All in all, it's a fun and unique dining experience. Oh, and they have an awesome panda statue in the dining room. Seriously, it's awesome.

I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and grab some lunch at chinos! 

I've been eating at chinos for years and it always satisfies my craving for...chinos! The mix of Chinese and Mexican food may seem odd at first but once you check out their tasting/explanation of their food it will all make sense. You can take some classic and wonderfully prepared Chinese or Mexican food items, then add them to a burrito or quesadilla or just have them as is. And don't forget the rice and beans, my personal favorite being the black beans and jerk fried rice. 

The atmosphere is simple and clean, great for a lunch break or casual dinner but not \"date night\" or intimidate dining necessarily... unless your date is craving chinos! 

My favs, off the top of my head:
Jade red chicken(or pork) quesadilla.
Carnitas burrito
Emerald chicken
Diablo chicken burrito
Jerk chicken quesadilla with vegetables
Jerk fried rice!! 
And volcano cookies!! 
*Drools!*

Forgot to mention, not sure how this made it last, The cookies!! You get a snickerdoodle with your order. These are usually soft, large and amazing!! Even better, if you get lucky their weekend specialty cookie will be the chocolatey chewy volcano! (buy a dozen!!)"}
{"text":"THEY GIVE YOU THE BEST SNICKERDOODLE COOKIES WITH EVERY ORDER!!! 

SOLD! 

But seriously, their jade red chicken is awesome. It's the only thing I ever get because I'm just hooked! It's a little crunchy, a little spicy, a little sweet, kinda salty, always tender and has such unique flavor. Whether in a quesadilla (try it seriously, it's great) or just over rice, this stuff never disappoints. 

The snicker doodles they make IN-HOUSE could rival that of a bakery and they come with every entree!! Can't beat it! The price is nice for a reasonable amount of food so you never leave hungry or poor. 

They also carry a great fountain drink that is green tea and peach. Never see it around any where else. It's an awesome compliment to the jade red (just saying').

Love chino! If you want to take someone to a truly unique dining experience that is very causal and affordable, this is the place. If you like tasty food adventures, go to Chino!"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way....

I kick myself if I don't stop at this place when I visit Phoenix. This is on my to-do list. I have taken a taxi cab to this place when I didn't have a car.

The Chile Relleno and Egg Foo young combo is amazing and will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"I love Chino Bandido for several reasons.  The black beans are strange, but tasty.  The chinese bbq pork and emerald chicken never fail to please me.  Who couldn't love the amazing snickerdoodles? (My favorite cookie, by the way, and they do it justice!)  When I am feeling a bit indecisive, this is the ideal place.  Plus, the staff are super nice and are willing to explain anything or set you up with a sample to try new things.  Definitely a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"A hearty meal for a hearty people.  No frills setting but you will be pleasantly surprised at how well they meld some meaty Asian fare with some South of the Border garnishments."}
{"text":"I first learned about Chino Bandito when the Chandler location just opened. And at that time I was a huge fan. I remembered how much I loved anything in the quesadillas. The cheese and tortillas were a perfect combination with something like sweet and sour pork...who would have thunk it!!!

I have in the last few months gone to Chino's 2 times. I have always gotten my fall back the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla, it is so good! And I have tried their Chile Relleno. Which is so interestingly unique. Who ever came up with the idea of using Chinese Wontons crushed up as the coating of the Chile Relleno deserves an Award! Who doesn't love Chinese Wonton!?!?! 

Don't forget the Black Beans, which are spicy and combined with the Jerk Fried Rice, YUMO! The best sides to your already unique and fun meal.

I think the best part is when people see your food and you tell them Chinese Mexican Food. Their reactions are priceless! 

This is not healthy food, this is not food to eat regularly, but every once in a while it is a darn good meal!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of fusion food. Fusion food has always struck me as overhyped and odd tasting for the sake of being hip. Then came Chino Bandido.

This place is amazing! Before you order, make sure to ask for samples. When I initially walked in, I had no idea what to order, but the girl at the register was super nice and helped me figure out what to order after testing out some of the meat options. I ended up getting a delicious combo meal with a side of rice, Jade Red Chicken, and a quesadilla with machaca. All of the flavors seem to fit perfectly together unlike a lot of fusion food experiments.

I'm not sure if this is a standard thing, but they even gave us a free snicker doodle cookie with each entree!! Way better than a fortune cookie in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this little gem! The menu was interesting but I incorporated Yelp to assist with recommendations!! The meals were delicious and different!! The pictures will say it all!!!
I will definitely return to this great place that thinks out of the box!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that i think gets a love or hate following, meaning you either love it or hate it and there is little gray area.  For me I really like Chino Bandido.  I think it also depends on your food combination, because you can certainly get a bad food combo.  

First timers need to go up to the bar and get their into to Chino's food tasting.  This is a really good idea and you get a little free food.  The service has always been good and the people who work here have always been really helpful to those that are just a little confused.  

For me I get the Black Beans (YUMMY) and jerk chicken rice, with Emerald chicken and a jerk chicken quesadilla.   I really like this combo, it has a little spice in the quesadilla the beans and the rice and a wonderful cooling ginger in the emerald chicken that really compliments the rest of the dish.  I have strayed from this combo quite a few times but always come back to it as i think its the best combo i have found.  

This is a place that everyone should try.  Its unique and some people will just love the place and some wont.  But do be warned if you do like it, you will every now and then get a little craving and since its the only place that serves this sort of food you will go out of your way to make it there."}
{"text":"Visited Chino again a couple of nights ago. Hadn't been there for a couple of years and pretty much nothing has changed. Same great food. I went for Jade Red Chicken Burrito, Jerk Chicken Quesadilla, black beans and plain rice. I love the fact that they make everything from scratch in this place. The food is simply terrific, if a bit greasy, but that's to be expected from the type of food they serve.

Remember, if it is your first time visiting be sure to let the staff know so they can give you samples of several items and show you how to order."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to go! Who would have thought that mixing Mexican and Chinese food would be a good idea? Definitely not me... at least until you try it!

My usual order: Jade red chicken, cheese quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice... and top it off with their snickerdoodle!

The ordering scheme is a little odd at first, but the workers behind the counter are always willing to help. And if you've never been before, they're always willing to let you try anything first. So yummy and definitely worth the drive to get there!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. They walked us through the menu and let us sample a few items before ordering. Order came out with Cuban black beans instead of the refried beans we ordered. They were ok but did not like the sweetness of them. Food was ok. Not bad. But not amazing either. The green sauce on the emerald chicken was good on its own but overpowered everything else on the plate. All I could taste and smell was the ginger. And I love ginger. The concept of ordering everything individually for a combo is nice, but once everything is piled on top of itself it is overwhelming. The snickerdoodle at the end was yummy though. It was worth a try but not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I always stop by when I'm in north Phoenix regardless. I've been going for years. Broke my heart when I moved back to the eat valley and they closed chandler."}
{"text":"Never been here I have lived on this side of town for over 10 years. For some reason driving by this place NEVER made me want to stop here that Circle K corner just never appealed to me. Well everyone talks about this place so I finally broke down last week. The parking lot was PACKED so I felt good going in. 

Everyone seemed pretty cheery and the guy who helped me didnt seem to mind that he had to explain everything to me. I ended up ordering chile relleno burro w the Tijuana veggie quesadilla beans and rice. I was surprised there was no Mexican rice on the menu. Anyway my friend tried the Machaca in a burro. Overall nothing stood out to me as fabulous this trip. Not with the food sorry. 

The relleno was nice and crispy with good heat to it but no flavor. I tried the machaca and it was nicely cooked but pretty flavorless as well. Beans were beans. I have a feeling the Mexican food here just isnt great and I am willing to come back and try the Chinese next time. On the other hand I found that all the hot PHX firemen grab lunch here and that alone will probably get me here again very soon. I feel safer eating just in case I forget how to chew and need to be saved with some mouth to mouth. ;)"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing! Service is courteous and friendly. They were promt and efficient with cleaning our just used table and sitting during lunch rush."}
{"text":"If I had to eat only one thing for the rest of my life it would be the Jade Red burrito. The food is insane! Mexican/Chinese?!?! What? Yeah it may sound weird but OMG, amazing!

The location on 19th ave is slightly better tasting,  but in no way down playing the awesomeness of Chinos!"}
{"text":"If I had to eat only one thing for the rest of my life it would be the Jade Red burrito. The food is insane! Mexican/Chinese?!?! What? Yeah it may sound weird but OMG, amazing!"}
{"text":"Based off the visual appearance of the restaurant you would may be skeptical of eating here but, the food is amazing! I moved to PHX in 2014 and instantly herd good things about this place by many recommendations, so i gave the place a try and was not let down! Im looking forward to eating there more often, I just wish the establishment would upgrade the visual ambience to compliment their great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Unique concept - poor execution

After hearing about Chino Bandido for years, we found ourselves nearby at lunch time and really looked forward to trying this place out.  Chino Bandido has a unique concept, however, I feel,  the food is poorly executed.  

My co-worker and I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the  food. Maybe we were expecting more because of the all the great reviews and  recommendations we read. To be perfectly honest, the food was nothing terribly special, and simply putting mexican food on a bed of white rice shouldn't be confused with real fusion cuisine.  
 
On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered the machaca bowls.  The bowls are  served in tin takeout containers. The machaca had an odd taste and was on the dry side and the rice was warm at best. The meal just wasnt very good. 

On a positive note, the menu choices are unique, and Chino Bandido does an excellent job of allowing you to sample the various items, and the service is outstanding. At the end of the day though, the food was pretty basic. I would say the Snickerdoodle cookie that comes with each entree was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"It's ok. I think the reviews are a little misleading. I'm a New Yorker that recently moved to PHX. It's not NY quality Asian Fusion but it's not bad. I'm not basing my review on the decor or lack of but on the quality of the food. The Chicken fried rice was bland, they only use very little soy sauce and scallions, nothing else. I was pleasantly surprise to find real pieces of chicken instead of the imitation meat that many Chinese places use. The Jade chicken is very very good. I will definitely come back just for the jade chicken. The jerk chicken was dry, I understand jerk chicken has a dry rub but it's not juicy whatsoever. It feels like it's been re-cooked too many times. The cookies are a nice surprise. The children's menu is priced very low and it's items are not bad. Overall is not NY Asian style fusion but it's not horrible."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was against going to Chino. It just seemed like too many different flavors for me to enjoy it. As soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly by Mark. He then gave us 6 samples of the food to try and then proceeded to explain the menu and how to order. 

The food is really good. I opted for the Emerald Chicken; chicken breast with a ginger onion sauce and carnitas, white rice and re-fried beans. The Jade Red Chicken is kind of like sesame chicken and was delicious, as was the fried rice and Snickerdoodle cookie that you get with your dish. 

Not a fancy place by any means. It's reminiscent of a Chinese take out, but much larger. Its definitely an experience worth trying."}
{"text":"This is the gem of Arizona - literally so delicious.

I've been coming here since I was about 5, so that's 16 years for me now. I'm from Scottsdale, so the commute is long - but worth it.

The refried beans are soooooo dank and all the rices are great. The jade chicken is delicious but oh my god the cookies... everytime we always get a stack of cookies to go.

The place looks questionable, yes. But this is a delicious establishment. Think of it as more charming. Holy crap - if I could make everyone go here I would. COME EAT HERE IT'S DELICIOUS AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here today and I must say it was AHMAZING! I'll be bringing friends here often! Delicious food, the service was so quick and there's plenty of food to bring home. I had the carnitas, I consider that one of my top 3 favs now"}
{"text":"and dives. I tried it then and I wasnt impressed. Which was puzzling because I also heard it was good. Never went back UNTIL  10yrs ago last week. Still sucked. I dont get it. The jade chicken is nothing special. Even tho im told its great . Both times me and the multiple people we where with didnt find anythimg really appealing. No ome wad spiting it out but none of us finished anything and we didnt take the leftover home."}
{"text":"Dan E basically has it perfect here, so make sure to read his.  I have trouble adding much to it.

It's a unique venue that effectively merges Caribbean, Mexican, and Chinese flavors into something all it's own.

When just stopping for a quick meal and not a big production, it is a great, though not lite choice.

Remember that you get a cookie with each order, so save room.  On weekends you get a choice between the usual snickerdoodle and a volcano cookie (chocolate).

Remember to ask for tastes of anything you're not familiar with before ordering, and trying mixing things up by trying them in quesadilla and burrito formats instead of just dumped in with the rice and beans."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry the east valley location closed.  It was close and, while the location was nothing fancy as well as being a little hard to find, the food was uniquely amazing.   The staff was pretty awesome too...They always  seemed happy to answer any questions you had and would usually offer info before you asked.

Unfortunately, the remaining location is over 50 miles round trip which makes it tough for me to visit even occasionally.  Worth a try when I can, especially the rare time when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall restaurant with very casual decor but the food is incredible. My roommates and I get the jerk chicken almost weekly. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Is it Mexican food? Chinese? Jamaican?! No one knows!!! Try this place! Don't know how someone put these together, but man is it good stuff.

Laid back atmosphere, (you'll be sitting on plastic chairs and dining on the finest \"Lifetime\" folding tables Costco can supply!) The food is freshly prepared and goes from mild to spicy! I usually get the jerk chicken, but last time...last time, I got the machaca. There's no going back now. It was on point and yes, a bit on the spicy side. 

Much spice. Very wow. So flavor.  

I've been here 4 or 5 times now and I still don't know how to fill out their counter card. The staff is nice but they kinda just fill out your card to expedite the process and push you along. Just go with the flow and you'll be fine. 

Also, tried the watermelon tea last time. Delicious."}
{"text":"What's not to like about the Bandido?  You've got two of the best hunger cures fused unpretentiously under one roof. At the lil Mexican Panda you get a pretty huge meal topped off with a stellar free cookie for a joke of a price - plus the \"in the know\" feeling you get when you finally figure out how to order here.  It can be daunting for a first timer. 

There are some misses here, because chinese doesn't always fuse well with Mexican, but there are some tried and true classics (I wont repeat the exhaustive list of favorites that other Yelpers have already posted). 

Chino Bandido is truly original and highly addicting.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow super good! Has a unique flavor and kick to it. I'm loving it. Cool vibe and staff too. I'm visiting and testing out 4+ star places. This is definitely my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I'm not a big Mexican food person but enjoyed the food while I was there."}
{"text":"Great taste, a wonderful experience.
Took the golfing Phil there and after eating he took 2 orders to go, was back the next day and back with friends that weekend. 
My favorite is 7/11 Jade Red on not fried chicken, Love 9 Emerald Chicken too.  Best black beans world wide period!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came here and wasn't sure what to expect. I was VERY pleasantly surprised!!  I loved how the staff gave you samples, explained how the ordering system worked, and were super friendly.
I had the BBQ pork, the jade chicken, pork fried rice, & refried beans. I really enjoyed the chicken, though the pork wasn't as good as I thought. I mixed the rice & beans together- super yummy! 
My favorite part of the meal by far was the snickerdoodles. They're thick, warm, & the perfect texture. It's a random addition, but a good one!
I ended getting additional cookies. They're so yummy!

Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Chino Bandido's about 4 times and each time is a different experience. The food so far for me has swayed from great to just ok, because of this inconsistency I am giving it 3 stars. The cookie is awesome though every time."}
{"text":"This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share."}
{"text":"Provender: I ordered the number 7 (Jade Red Chicken), plenty of seating in the two dining areas. The tables are the plastic foldable ones usually seen in party rental stores.

Prices: reasonable. Under $10 for most specials.

Parking: ample, it's located in a strip mall.

People: fun for all ages.

Perks: they serve booze. And diet Dr. Pepper!"}
{"text":"If you ignore the lack of welcoming decor, you'll find yourself with a unique
menu of delicious choices, especially the jade chicken or machaca. The cookies are perfectly baked, every time, the red sauce is one of my favorites, and I have no complaints.  They also have reasonably fast service for the amount of customers they serve."}
{"text":"Food was great. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time as I have had so many people tell me about it. Location could be better but it was easy to find.  Order at the counter and they bring it to you. It is very casual atmosphere. Large area for tables almost cafeteria like. They did have some interesting decorations.  The food would definitely get 5 stars. Can have food in a quesadilla if you want. I would do this the next time."}
{"text":"Overrated.  The concept is great, it's the execution that is lacking.  Jerk chicken was nowhere near spicy enough, jade chicken was too sweet.  I want to like this place, but it didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"I don't get it. This place looks, excuse me IS filthy and the food...GROSS. Not appealing to the eye. Pig slop and the taste...TASTELESS. I don't get why there are so many who RAVE about this place."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here,  and the only reason I took a star away,  was because I had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! I very specifically made sure to say NO BEANS.... Unfortunately,  my food was covered in them!  The service here is very very good... They know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you.   The food is very good,  was looking forward to it...  Looks like totinos is lunch today!!"}
{"text":"I was new to this place. Have the front counter people tour u on the food they serve if ur new!!  Samples of all their popular dishes.  
Loved the pollo diablo alongside jade red chicken and pork fried rice. FTW"}
{"text":"Three words: Jade. Red. Chicken.  

That stuff has been on my mind constantly since my first reluctant trip to Chino Bandidos.  

My wife and I were on our way to try this place when we both chickened out because the menu and ordering was so weird and different.  Big mistake.  They have a guy there who literally walks you through the menu, ordering and gives you samples of their main dishes, rices and beans.  I was excited to place my order by the time I finished tasting everything.

I ordered the Jade Red Chicken and BBQ Pork burrito with Chicken Fried Rice and black beans.  

I should have ordered a bucket of jade red chicken because that stuff is amazing!!  It pissed me off that the BBQ Pork had to share the plate with it.  

The BBQ Pork didn't have a chance, plus it was bland and boring anyways.  I should have ordered the jerk chicken rice instead of the chicken fried rice.  It had some weird spices in there that turned me off.  The black beans were excellent!  Spicy and very different!

Don't be scared to try this place."}
{"text":"This place is literally a diamond in the rough. When I tell my friends to meet me here, they are somewhat weary of my description of how to get here. It's just north of Greenway on the west side, right across from a trailer park in a dumpy old strip mall. 

It's brilliant really. Let's take two of some of the best guilty pleasures: Mexican and Chinese food and mix them together! When I'm hungry and am craving food and can't make a decision, this is my go-to place, because it satiates the cravings for salty, rich, cheesy, and maybe spicy if you'd like. Oh, and sweet too! (They give you homemade Snickerdoodles with each meal!)

My favorite thing to do is get the combo platter with the Emerald Chicken (so light, tender, and yummy), either Machaca beef or carnitas in a quesadilla, and the pork fried rice with black beans. As another reviewer said, go for the Jerk chicken or Pollo Diablo if you want options that are spicier. 

It can get confusing what to order since there's too many options, but no need to fret. They let you sample everything! You can just order one dish (i.e. Teriyaki chicken) alone with rice, or you can get the combo like the one I mentioned above so you have more choices. Ordering a meat/veggie as a quesadilla or burrito is merely an included option if you get the combo plate, but it's extra if you're only getting one meat/veggie alone. 

Don't forget to check out the life size Panda in a sombrero either while waiting for your food. The place can get pretty packed on weekend evenings..."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken that i have ever had.  Great place must try at least once. fried rice was great as well"}
{"text":"Previously featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I ordered the Jade Red Chicken. It was good but nothing special. I also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with fried rice. Again good but nothing special. Customer service was good. They let you sample foods before order so that was nice. Also nice that you can order a bit of chinese/mexican/caribbean food. Prices are good. The restuarant could use an upgrade in remodeling and getting cleaned up. But its worth a try to come here and taste the food."}
{"text":"I have a pretty similar experience with Jenn H. in that the first time I came, I wasn't impressed at all (I'd probably say that I was disappointed), but the second time I came, I really enjoyed this funky fusion.

I came here on the recommendation of a friend that had came here a few years earlier on a road trip that passed through Phoenix. Not really knowing how the menu worked, I just ordered the \"Jade Red Chicken\" rice bowl because it was supposed to be the most popular item on the menu. I was pretty disappointed when I found out that I had gone all the way to Phoenix (for the Fiesta Bowl) for a bowl of General Tso's chicken with white rice. As I was eating I saw people order eating some pretty wild stuff (like chinese bbq pork \"char siu\" quesadillas, etc.) so I was pretty adamant about coming back and trying this place again. 

I got a chance to go back two days later and instead of getting a rice bowl, I got the combo where you can choose two items off the menu (and turn them into a burrito/quesadillas if you'd like) along with rice of your choice and beans. So I got the jade red chicken again (this time in a quesadillas) and then I got the emerald chicken, which a buddy of mine had last time and looked good, along with jerk fried rice and black beans. 

Being both a fan of chinese and mexican cuisine (in the traditional sense), I knew that this place was going to challenge my view of food marrying the two together. But I actually really enjoyed it. I should strongly stress the point that you need to \"get\" the menu before you should order. The staff is pretty nice about explaining the concept of the menu to you (it'd help if you ask, which I didn't the first time until AFTER I ordered). 

With the freedom in the menu, however, I should probably warn my fellow Yelp!ers that I can see how some of these combination can go wrong and come back and blow up on you (or maybe inside of you, hahaha). Good luck mixing!!"}
{"text":"Love Chino Bandido's! Great food that you can't find anywhere else! The combination of Chinese food with Mexican food is truly genius. And the fact that you get a snicker doodle cookie with your meal is a plus! My favorite is the jade red chicken burrito and jerk chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"I still love Chino Bandido, even as a vegan.

My normal purchases are:
A combo meal with veggie \"quesadilla\" (no cheese) + black bean burrito (no cheese), refried beans (no cheese) and white rice. 
The veggie no cheese quesadilla still has a crisped up tortilla piled in with lettuce, broccoli & tomato bits. I drench it in their fantastic hot sauce & dab in some refried beans. The no cheese burrito still has the best texture as you bite through the just right chewy tortilla into the soft beans, drenched with hot sauce of course.

On the weekends, I like to get a tostada no cheese too.

The staff is always friendly and willing to highlight and accentuate the no-cheese requests on my order form."}
{"text":"This hole in a wall place is a hole in one! Great food, great service! Highly recommend the jade red chicken!"}
{"text":"I happen to be typing this while my son is awaiting a new plate of food after finding a COCKROACH in his Red Chicken plate. While my plate, a machaca burrito, was delicious I could not help but think of the cockroach the whole time I was trying to eat my lunch. The guy at the counter did take it around to show every one in the kitchen, apologized and they prepared him a new fresh fish from a new batch. But there is a certain expectation when you go out to eat that you won't find bugs in your food. Not sure I will ever be back to eat here. Shame because it was highly recommended."}
{"text":"Huge fans of Chino. We live nearby and often order takeout. Have not had anything on the menu that hasn't been tasty. My favorite is the Chinese bbq pork. Jerk fried rice is also quite yummy."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the early 90s, and have never had a bad meal.  The menu is unique, but the food is awesome.  Dine with confidence that you will have an awesome meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. I live in Northern California, but when I come to town this is the first and last place I stop."}
{"text":"The sample bar is a very good idea - props to Chino Bandido for their creativity and marketing strategies.  Still, I think this place, while kitschy, is not worth driving 15 miles out of your way to experience. If you happen to be in the area, choose it over Taco Bell or Panda Express any day. But don't take a date here. Take friends from out of town who want to experience the \"real\" Phoenix - I'd say fusing anything with Mexican food is just about as Phoenix as it gets.  

PS, I went next door to Poppa Maize after lunch. The owner has been going to Chino Bandido for nine years and never knew that you can get the Jade Chicken without the breading. Not like she'd have to worry about it, but I do, so there you go. :)"}
{"text":"I came here to Phoenix on a business trip.  My clients told me about a place that is a combination of chinese and mexican and I initially did not think the two went together.  

But man, this place is amazing.  I order the chicken and rice with the spicy sauce.  It blew my mind away.  The plates kinda reminded me of when I went to Halal carts in NY. 

Easing to find parking, order came out quickly, and place had plenty of seats.

This is my first time going or even hearing about a Chinese-Mexican.  Still blows my mind away.  lol"}
{"text":"Was surprised that the jerk fried rice was not as spicy like the first time I went here. The portions seemed smaller than before and barely filled the round foil container. The food was still tasty and satisfying. I recommend the black beans over the refried since they have more flavor. Service was good and prompt. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our choices. The order paper is a bit confusing and the staff is there to explain to the newbies but it still takes a couple of times of doing the paper before you get the hang of it."}
{"text":"==What Happens Every Time I Suggest Chino Bandido For Lunch At Work==

An educational tragicomedy by Jetta

(An office setting. Phones are ringing. Nobody seems to notice.)

JETTA
So, since I'm running out and getting lunch, I say we do Chino Bandido.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Chino Bandido, what's that?

JETTA
It's this Chinese/Mexican fusion place on 19th and Greenway.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Chinese and Mexican? What, like they put sweet and sour chicken in a burrito?

JETTA
Well, their menu's a little more diverse than that, but sure, that example is sufficient.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
That sounds fucking disgusting! Putting Chinese food with Mexican food, that's just weird, man! 

JETTA
Well, I like it. So it's either that or you get your own lunch.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
You're serious though, you can get like Chinese food in a tortilla?

JETTA
Alright, so here's how it breaks down. They have 14 different \"entree\" selections. You can get them in a burrito form or a quesadilla form. If you get a combination, you can two entrees with some fried rice and beans, though I just opt for a double order of fried rice because I can't stand beans (it's a texture thing, it's why I won't eat mushrooms).

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Um, okay. Can you get me two bean burritos?

JETTA
No.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
What, they don't have bean burritos?

JETTA
No, they do. But I'm not getting you anything from there if that's all you're going to get.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Why not?

JETTA
Because you're an adult. You might as well go to Red Lobster and order the chicken fingers. If you're not going to order off the menu like a grown up, I'm not getting you lunch. Besides, you can get bean burritos at the cafeteria for cheaper.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Okay, at least tell me this...do they have Chinese people working behind the counter?

JETTA
I'm not sure. I didn't ask any of them for their passport. But they do make a mean jade red chicken. That's Chinese enough for me. What do you care, anyway? You eat at Olive Garden all the time.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
That's because I'm Italian.

JETTA
Yeah but the people who make the food there aren't.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Good point.

JETTA
Look, are you going to get something or not?

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
I don't know what to get.

JETTA
Here, we keep some of their menu forms here. Fill it out. Hurry. I'm hungry and full of artificially occurring hormones.

10 MINUTES LATER...

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Um...I think I filled it out.

JETTA
Let me see...no, you most certainly did not fill this out. You just put a bunch of checkmarks next to things. Fuck it. I'm ordering for you. Hope you like what I get you.

1 HOUR LATER....

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Hey, is this quesadilla supposed to have cheese in it?

JETTA
If there's cheese in it, I think it's safe to say it belongs there.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Oh. That's cool. I mean, it's good. It's really good. I just, you know, not used to having cheese with...uh...what's in this quesadilla anyway?

JETTA
BBQ Pork, I think. The burrito is Pollo Diablo. 

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
What's that?

JETTA
You took four years of Spanish. You tell me.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Okay...well, anyway, it's good. I mean, it's different, but I like it, I guess. 

TWO DAYS LATER...

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Jetta, you wanna make a Chino Bandido run?

JETTA
Dude, I just clocked in like ten minutes ago.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Oh. Okay. I'll give it a few more minutes then. I'm craving it like mad, though.

DIFFERENT N00B I WORK WITH
What's Chino Bandido?

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Oh man, it's this awesome, like, Mexican and Chinese, what's the word, oh yeah, fusion place.

DIFFERENT N00B I WORK WITH
Mexican and Chinese? That sounds gross, dude.

JETTA
I'll be right back guys. I'm going to go powder my nose. With a gun.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Ha ha! You said that last week during the staff meeting."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had not been here in a long time and finally back in my old stomping grounds. It took me a long time to try it and it's the best food in the area for something fast and convenient. Love the Jade red chicken and fried rice combo."}
{"text":"Seen this place on tv once and tried them out because says you can get the best of two worlds Chinese and Mexican food. Nope, not what you think. Pretty bad combinations besides the amount we paid for the food I could have stayed home and had better flavor in my food. Live and learn."}
{"text":"The food at Chino's is absolutely amazing. I'm a sucker for their jerk chicken or their jade red chicken. This place is usually busy however there are instances when it won't take too long to get a meal. Overall, great experience coming to Chino and I always love bringing my friends and family here. When visiting Arizona, you must try to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was a huge let down!! It's in terrible need of a MAJOR cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were!! We will not be going here again"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I had no shame. I wanted to curl up next to the monstrous statue of the Chino Bandido in the dinig room to take a photo.  Alas, there is still some shame left in me...

I love the idea of CB: Mexican Asian Fusion.  My favorite part about this place is the mini tour of the flavors you're taken on if you let them know that you're new. I loved being able to taste so much stuff: Carnitas, Jerk Fried Rice, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans, etc.  The dish I most wanted to try, Pollo Diablo, was not on the tasting menu, but other thigns were tasty.  I also like that with the combination meals, you can get two meat items and get them served plain (over rice), in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  Adding cheese to stuff is almost always a good idea, but not to asian flavored meats. That's weird.

We ordered two combinations with Carnitas, Jerk Chicken, Jen Red Pork, and the Pollo Diablo. Quick summary:
-Carnitas: pretty flavorful; one of the better dishes
-Jerk Chicken: a bit on the dry side and not as spicy as advertised.  Perhaps we roll too hot for most places.
-Jen Red Pork: Crispy on the outside, mostly tender inside. A sweet, warmish sauce. Not bad at all.
-Pollo Diablo: This was supposed to be my star (thanks Guy Fieri for hyping it!). It was spicier than the others, but not necessarily more flavorful.  It was dry in the burrito, so I opened up the tortilla and munched on it plain.  More moist, but mostly oily moist and very little flavor otherwise.
-Black beans: pretty flavorful but the consistency of grout. Seriously. These beans lined the walls of my stomach and wouldn't leave!
-Free cookie!  DId you say free?  Cookie?  Yay! Chocolcate Volcano cookie was nothing like a volcano, but yummy nonetheless!

I love the idea and love the friendly service.  I don't love the meh flavors or the way my stomach felt for the rest of the day: gut-bomb city!

It is, however, a weird torture I might endure again if I lived here.  There's something that pulls me towards you, you cute, chubby, Chino Bandido!"}
{"text":"I love Chino Bandido its an awesome place to eat a different type of food. The twist of Chinese food and Mexican is amazing. My favorite is the Emerald Chicken \"number 11\" and Jerk Fried rice JFR. The chicken has a nice tastebud tingling flavor of ginger and onion and the JFR compliments it with a light peppery spice. The delicious sugar cookie that it comes with tops it all off. The staff is friendly also and will help you decide if you're new."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. The combinations are endless and it's all great. The jerk chicken was very well spiced and the carnitas beef was excellent also. The pork fried rice was a good addition and excellent as well."}
{"text":"Well it can hit 2 cravings in one visit.  And they make it affordable by not wasting money on decor or any frivolities.  Just get a giant panda with a mustache and a sombrero and be done with it.

We were lost on how or what to order.  Was a tad confused with the ordering sheet.  But there is a \"tasting station\" with someone to explain how to order and with about six of the more popular meats to try out.  Then off you go to the cashier.

We had chicken emerald and red jade chicken done into a quesadilla and finally the carnitas and pollo diablo with rice and beans.  I like the options of making them into a burrito or quesadilla or just simply itself.  

I liked everything.  I hardly ever clean off my plate, I like to save some for later to cut some of the calories in half.  But this time I finished my whole meal. It was so tasty and So good!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here just perplexed! I cant believe I haven't Yelped about Chino until now! Ive been coming here for years and years since its so close to my work.. what have I been smoking?! 

I don't have much to add but this.. chile relleno burrito.. you've never had a gut bomb until you've tried this one! Cheese stuffed into a green chile.. battered in crumbs then deep fried until hot and crispy then it's wrapped into a tortilla with more melted cheese.. who knew you could pack so much goodness into a burrito?! Mmm, goodness!"}
{"text":"I would give 5+ stars!

Chino Bandito is a great little tucked away gem. The food is remarkably tasty as they let you sample it first to pick your dishes!

Shop in for a bite and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"A large group of us dined here for lunch on Saturday afternoon at the recommendation of our host friend who frequents this place.

This super casual restaurant is located in a small strip mall of sorts. It was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" for its unique flavor combos, pairing Mexican and Chinese cuisine.

Ordering can be a little confusing at first, but our friend helped us out. They also have someone at the counter to explain/answer questions and give samples upon request. Once you're ready to order, tell them what you want (or give them a completed order slip, available at the entrance), give them your name, and then go sit down; they bring it all out to you. Everyone was very friendly.

I got the Chili Relleno and Veggie Salad Combo in a bowl with the Jerk Rice and Black Beans. The salad is just a salad topped with shredded cheese, and didn't come with dressing, but they had sauces at the register that went well with it. The rest of my dish was out of this world delicious. Hot and fresh, and relatively quick -- did not disappoint. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well!

Fountain beverages available. Orders come with a cookie; they had snickerdoodle and chocolate lava. I tried both -- both were so yummy.

Lots of seating in the dining room. The restaurant itself needs a face lift and/or a really deep clean scrub down badly. Tables were dirty in general, too, though the place was pretty busy.  

Definitely a \"dive\"...but one that is absolutely worth visiting. Good experience overall, and if we lived in the area, I'm sure we would go back!"}
{"text":"It was a psychotically good idea to blend Mexican and Chinese foods - the flavors all work together fantastically. Also recommend getting a black bean burrito to round out your meal - spicy and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Really wasn't to sure about this place when I first heard of it, however I gave it a try. This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant. Very big space for large groups, big screen on the wall with sports playing. Now lets get to the food, it's a mixture of Asian an Mexican. I always end up getting the same thing jade chicken black beans an jerk chicken rice. Maybe one day I will venture out an try other things, then again maybe not."}
{"text":"Very tasty food once you find the combo of entrees that taste the best to you. The Jade Chicken and Pork are my favorite. The cookie that comes with the meals are delicious."}
{"text":"One Liner: Chinese Mexican? Mexican Chinese?

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.5
It's 15 minutes before noon. We tried to get there early to beat the traffic. Of course, we had no such luck here. It might be 11:45am, and it might be 115 degrees out, the hole, the big hole in the wall place was packed, and the line was out the door. 
Anyway, they have a sampling station for newbies on the left side of the counter. I got a chance to try a few different dishes before I settle on the order. It makes the place a zoo, but I like the concept. After all, most food here are somewhat pre-cooked.
So what does Chinese Mexican or Mexican Chinese taste like?
I can't really describe it. It's new to me. I know I fully enjoyed the diablo pork, emerald chicken and most important of all, the jerked fried chicken. Ok there is nothing chinese or mexican about jerked fried chicken, but it's still a creative fusion dish, a perfect one for that matter.
When the girl brought the food over, I just couldn't wait to redirect the food right into my mouth. Before she reached me, she slipped!
I managed to saved the food, both plates. Only 2 things dropped, the snicker doodle and the girl. I feel really bad that I wasn't able to keep her from falling, but I saved the food!!

Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.8

Service 0.2: She probably bruised her behind delivering food to me, I've gotta leave full score here.
 
Decor 0.1: It's old, ugly, but somewhat special. It looks like an expanded cafeteria.  

Speed 0.2: Even with the line out the door, they still make very good progress. The food gets on your table FAST. 

Dessert 0.1: good snicker doodle 

Prices 0.2: It's more than reasonable. Chinese take out prices for a great fusion creation? It's cheap. 

My score for this experience is 4.3 stars.
For a chance at the oddest and the most delicious creation on earth, it's no doubt a 5 star in my heart and my stomach.

P.S. Do try the 2 different hot sauce they have there. They are not your typical hot sauce. They aren't very spicy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their try before you buy bar is just great. Staff is always friendly and very helpful with their intriguing ordering system. Food has always been great. The black beans are wonderful though can be an acquired taste for some. Overall I keep coming back and enjoy it every time. It does get quite busy so get in line and then write down your order!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat to get a taste of Asian/Mexican infused food. Jade red and jerk chicken with pork fried rice is what I always get"}
{"text":"Amazing taste! The Jerk chicken and jerk fried chicken make me cry - literally! I love it! Also the Jade Red Chicken is incredible!! Also, great service, the people that work there seem to really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the original location in Phoenix for the past 7 years so I was excited they opened up a location in Chandler. I can't believe some yelpers commented on the decor. This isn't, and never has been, a place you are going to bring your date to and order a bottle of wine at the table. It also isn't a place you are going to ask for the \"low fat, low calorie\" dish. Chino's is a fast food place with folding tables, no servers, your meal comes in a tin throwaway plate, plastic silverware, and plastic cups. You go for the food, which combines Mexican and Chinese flavors for an incredible taste! It may not sound like it would be good, but it is and it's worth checking out. 

Good points: 
The combination of Mexican and Chinese dishes is incredible to say the least! 
If it is your first time at Chino's, you can ask to sample the dishes for free. I highly recommend this so you won't be surprised on what you order. 
You always receive a free Snicker doodle (always freshly baked that day) cookie or a Volcano (chocolate fudge cookie on weekends). 
You can create your own meal with a lot of different dishes rather than just ordering one dish. 

Bad points: 
Only a few; the Chandler location is somewhat hard to find if you have never been there. It's tucked back in behind the Walgreens. Not that big of a deal as long as you know where you are going. 
It can be a bit confusing when ordering (you fill out a small form) but just ask for help when you get there. 

The dish I always order is the following: Hengrenade Chicken (go with the Pollo Diablo if you are looking for some kick) in a homemade quesadilla, a side of Jade Red Chicken (my favorite and most popular), a side of black beans (they blend the beans with other flavors in a soupy consistency, so don't expect anything different, and these are VERY good.) with Jerk Fried Rice. This is all around $10 with a drink and will fill you up, especially with the free cookie. 

This is one of my favorite places to eat for a good, gut busting meal. Give the stone Mexican panda in the restaurant a little touch for good luck."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! The food is amazing. The building/dining room is old and a little shabby but don't let that stop you from trying it. You'll be hooked! Jade red chicken is a favorite!"}
{"text":"We've loved traveling around the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex trying the spots on Guy Fieri's show Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives.  So, we used that show as a guide for where to eat on a recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ on vacation.  We were not disappointed.  Granted, we like casual dining.  Especially on vacation.  Shorts, t-shirts, sandals kind of places - but with good food.  We liked Chino Bandido.  It's in a whole-in-the-wall kind of strip mall, and the ambiance is non-existent.  But, we enjoyed our meals and were disappointed that we ran out of vacation before we had stopped at all of Guy's hot spots.  By the way, these aren't low-cal places.  I gained 3 pounds on vacation by eating at Guy's choices.  I've been running laps around the high school in our town taking off the vacation weight.  It reminded me of going on a cruise - nothing to do in Arizona in late June but eat out and hang out by the pool.  But, it was an awesome vacation and I recommend Chino Bandido to anybody who is adventurous."}
{"text":"So I came here like 10 years ago and remember being amazed by the food. Fast forward ten years later and it was just okay. Maybe it is what I got (the quesadilla) because I tried some of the chicken and it was good. It was just very whatever to me. Again, I feel like it was more my meal than my cousins. Looking forward to go back and trying some of the other options!!"}
{"text":"This is the most unexpected marriage of food.  I have to admit, it's kind of fun eating refried beans with chopsticks!"}
{"text":"Chinese + Mexican Fusion. Try the Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken. Assemble a combo where you can choose any 2 meats and choose to eat them plain, in a burrito or quesadilla. Large space, free wi-fi, combos get a free cookie. If it's your first time, ask for an introduction, they will happily provide free samples of everything. Complex ordering and menu system is the only complaint...but the learning curve is worth it."}
{"text":"A staple in the North Phoenix restaurant community. Unique and delicious entrees, with a very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Average food.  Great concept and enjoyed my first visit.  However, the only really good item is the Red Jade Chicken."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were good experiences with the Jade Red Chicken. This place should expand!"}
{"text":"Being new to Phoenix and new to trying Mexican-chinese food. I give this place two thumbs up. If your new, they right a way welcome you with samples of their most popular entrees. This gives you an idea of what they offer and choose from there. Black beans are very tasty and spicy which I like. I had the Jade Red Chicken, which is similar to Orange Chicken but a bit sweeter. My son had chicken teriyaki with rice, they provide perfect portions for my 4 year old, he finished his whole meal which normally doesn't do. Instead of fortune cookies they give you a snicker doodle. Which is pretty darn good. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the middle. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food or place itself. It's dirty in the front God only knows what it looks like in the kitchen the burritos are really small In my opinion  this place is overated and over priced. I been here once and that was my 1st and last time  ever going  here  the staff is kinda rude also so that's a double whammy for me. Better off going to a clean and decent priced place rather  than here."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the portions were nice for a $12 meal. This place is definitely a dive so I wouldn't suggest taking anyone that is a little \"uppity\" here. Chino's definitely has some history and wear to it's building, but I have no doubt that the way they handle and prepare their food is clean.

I'm not that adventurous of an eater so it was nice try some samples before deciding what I wanted. The lady was really patient with everyone requesting samples and took the time to show everyone how to \"order the Chino way\". I ended up getting the emerald chicken, steamed rice, machaca beef, and black beans. Overall, the meal was filling, service was great, and the free cookie certainly helped."}
{"text":"Wow, first time, not last!  
Really good variety of food,  very tasty! 
Nice folks,  fast (dinner at 7pm)
Very, very good!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is my guilty pleasure. It is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl, delivered by a casually dressed employee who shouts your name until you claim it. And, you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie, as if there were not enough calories and carbs in the meal itself.

It's a dive. Black and white checkered floors. Murals and polaroids of customers mounted on the walls behind plastic.

Ayesha is right. It's a love/hate kind of place; and, those who love it will blurt out what they order at the mere mention - it's practically involuntary. 

Me? I'm \"jerk chicken add black beans.\" I have the number programmed into my phone so I can call in my order.

It's also addictive for those who like it. I am generally compelled to visit Chino within 72 hours of hearing someone mention it.

Here's the thing about Chino Bandido: it is NOT Chinese and it is NOT Mexican. It is Chino Bandido. It's its own animal. 

To try to label it can only lead to disappointment. So, I suggest: 
~ Know that we are not talking fast food prices -- a one item bowl with a soft drink is $9.15.
~ Enter with an open mind. 
~ Proceed immediately to the counter under the menu with all the pictures on it and tell the employee it's your first time. The employee will slip you a bunch of samples so you can taste what you're in for. 
~ Figure out what you like and accept help from the employee while you complete the unique order form (which is also demonstrated on the website: http://www.chinobandido.com/order.html).
~ Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Jade chicken quesadilla with just the right amount of spice. Make sure you try out the other meats, they do samples! My second choice would have been pollo diablo. If your sensitive to spice you might find it hot. Otherwise it will be very tasty. Has a sweet and spicy flavor. The retried beans are delicious and have cheese spread on top. The rice is a mix of Chinese and Mexican and very tasty! Whoever thought Mexican and Chinese food mix is a genius."}
{"text":"The food was cold. The beans looked like they were sitting in a pot all day. The rice was old, cold and dry. The Pollo Diablo was full of grease in the burrito. The ginger with green onions was cold and not very appetizing . The teriyaki chicken my kids got was cold and terriyaki sauce had no good flavor and the sauce looked like it came right out of the refrigerator. The only thing we enjoyed was the quesadilla ."}
{"text":"My son saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and insisted we try it. We found it and man was it crowded. A great mix of Asian and Mexican, I wouldn't mind returning someday."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I'll just give you my experience. 

Years ago, some guys from my office got lunch here every so often. They raved about it, so I figured I'd go see what the fuss was all about. I randomly picked a couple of items from the menu: combo with #1 and #13 (carnitas and pollo diablo; pork fried rice and black beans). I was a goner from the first bite. 

I eventually changed my habitual order to replace #1 with #14 (machaca), but otherwise, I have never strayed. It's just so good, I don't want to even try anything else. I can understand why they have so many awards and mentions on their walls.

Why I love it:

1) It's just plain GOOD. There's nothing else (that I know of) that's like it. You know when you have a unique favorite recipe, or a certain brand & flavor of ice cream that's incomparable to anything else, and when you're in the mood for it, nothing else will do? (Think \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).

2) Unpretentious. I'm a reverse snob: frou frou \"nouveau\" this or that really rubs me the wrong way. This place, a hidden jewel in an otherwise anonymous strip mall, is as down to earth as it gets. No fancy, uber-glam  seating here. 

3) Friendly staff.  This amazes me. They work lightning-fast, in a hot, steamy, loud, confined space, but they're always peppy and cheerful. No soup-nazis here.

This place is on my top 5 eats in Phoenix. If you ever try it, I can guarantee it won't be the first and last time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Delicious spin on food and always fresh! Great service, great menu choices and great portion sizes."}
{"text":"If you had told me before that I would enjoy a mix between Panda Express and your local Mexican joint, I'd a laughed. But between the Jade-red chicken, jerk fried rice, refried beans and snicker-doodle cookie, I couldn't imagine a better lunch. The food settled well, and I'll be back again soon! The staff was enthusiastic to help me when they heard it was my first time there, too.

What's even better than the food was the fact that I looked around and saw business men in suits and ties in a part of town that was beyond sketchy. They're definitely doing things the right way, and attracting people from all over the valley."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not a big fan of this place. Been several times and food quality is so-so for me. I guess it's more of a novelty thing but I can get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Such an unexpected treasure. Best food we had on our week long vacation. Cuban black beans rocked my world. Jerk rice was my second favorite thing. Jerk chicken and red jade chicken were 3rd and 4th but still awesome."}
{"text":"There are 2 loves in my life and they are Chinese food and Mexican food. To think they fused both into one delicious delight makes me believe they built this place in honor of me.

It's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions. The menu itself is a little confusing. There is too many acronyms and too much writing involved. I just wanna eat! Their signature dish is the jade chicken which is kinda like a Mexican style orange chicken. Pretty good i would have to say. The Jerk Chicken packs a punch with its kick of spiciness. The rice served with it is a little dry and it's no bueno to eat dry food and spicy food together, but still delicious overall.

If they had one of these in LA i would go all the time. Great food, great prices, great portions. Fast food at its best."}
{"text":"Great little place to go if you are looking for some good food. I find it funny that it's a Mexican/Asian mix but don't really care all that much cuz it's all pretty good. Not a lot of frills here but the food is inexpensive and pretty darn tasty. A great place to hit if you are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb I've been coming here for many years and will continue to come here to eat because its amazing food and they are quick getting you your food. M"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. We brought two newbies, so they got to experience the taste test. I like how they do that. The place is spacious and relatively clean. Food compares to the other Chino Bandido up on Greenway. I like it."}
{"text":"they let me sample everything before I ordered.
service and food was great.
yeah, its a dive, but we didn't mind."}
{"text":"Time for an update on Chino.

I still like Chino very much, BUT in recent times at the Chandler location I've been getting overly greasy dishes and lower quality chicken.

It's possible I've just been unlucky.

So I'm still a fan, but I hope quality control goes back up.

Vegetable Quesadilla still rocks!"}
{"text":"It's a restaurant inside of a rundown strip-mall, so I almost didn't go in at all. But I had heard good things about this Chinese/Mexican fusion, so I had to try it out. I wasn't disappointed. Their food was amazing. The Jade Red Chicken is a must and everything that I've tried on the menu (been there a few times  now) is flavorful and delicious. Large partions. And the staff is friendly and helpful for newbies (there menu ordering system is confusing). You can even try samples of things if you're not sure what you want.  I'm always in the mood for Chino!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Chino and I happened to find myself up North and thought why not. 

This is not a place where you go for the atmosphere. Walking in you are greeted with dingy tile, folding tables and probably outdated caricatures.

I loved it.

I went against getting their well-known \"not orange chicken\" and instead for the pork. I was not very impressed. I suppose I asked for it, literally, but the best thing I can say about it was that it was warm. Actually, that's not true. The snickerdoodle cookie that came with was delicious. Soft and tasty.

If I'm ever in the area again I'll be sure to stop in and try something else, but for now the best part of my experience was watching the D-backs lose."}
{"text":"This place is alright. It gets a huge fuss cause it was on diner drive ins and dives. It's not bad just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything worse about this place than it's location. When a bigger landmark is a sign next door that says \"Wide Shoes\" you are in geographical hell. This place is rarely busy but has tons of space and lots of potential. I have eaten there a bunch and love it. The jerk rice is killer. (someone here totally dissed it saying the only spice in it was pepper...umm...no) You really should try it and you will see. The combinations I have found to be my favorite are jade red chicken or sweet roasted pork in a quesadilla. Those are combinations of flavors that you would never expect to be that good. 

In my opinion they could make some changes and be making 10 times the money. 
#1. Get a normal freakin menu. You can't go this place and say I will have a number six with a large soft drink. None of us want to work or do much thinking to order our food. They want to do their sample demonstrations and they usually have time since NOBODY GOES THERE. I wish they would even have the guts to pilot a simplified menu--I think they would be shocked at how much more business they would get. 
#2 Get a few conventional items on the menu i.e. Nachos or chips and salsa or something that is a good snacky kind of food. 
#3 Come up with a signature item or two and give them original names rather than all of the all-menu-items-are-equal approach. 

It is worth checking out if you have not been there and I enjoy eating there still. It's a bit cafeteria/industrial warehouseish with not much to check out other than the statue of the panda in a sombrero."}
{"text":"Turned onto this place when they catered to our Startup Weekend event.

Tons of options, bunch of different food, confusing but they have like a whole taste-testing deal where they'll let you taste like everything so you know what you're getting into.

Jerk chicken will take your breath away at first, pretty hot but good and all the bowl options with rice and all that stuff is kinda cool.

HUUUGE room to have big groups in.

Food is good... nothing spectacular honestly"}
{"text":"I've always been a of food adventures, but the food here is just plain awful.  Orange chicken type dishes should NOT EVER be made into quesadillas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the valley!

I have been eating at this most excellent hole-in-the-wall since 1994 - when they were quite small. The food is an ecclectic mix of Chinese, Mexican and a little bit of the Caribbean.

If you are a newbie - let them know when you come in, and they will give you a taste of the main items on the menu.

I particularly like the Chinese BBQ Pork and the Jade Red Chicken served with pork fried rice and black beans...my wife lives on the spicier side of life and likes the Pollo Diablo (Devil Chicken) and Jerk Chicken (Not quite like we've had in Jamaica - but still quite good).

Every meal comes with a fresh baked and large cookie.

It is a kid friendly environment and is full of regulars who swear by the place - we have friends who used to drive from Chandler every Saturday just to eat at Chino - for the last year or two there has been a location in Chandler so they don't have to burn so much gas.

Chino proves that a restaurant doesn't have to have any Michelin stars to be a local favorite!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out after seeing it on Yelp and it was close to our house. The restaurant was really spacious and clean. We ordered a Jade Red chicken rice bowl and a combination plate with Jerk fried rice, black beans Machaca quesadilla and Emerald chicken. The Machaca quesadilla was tasty & crispy. Also the Jade Red chicken was good. However we didn't care to much for the Jerk fried rice, beans and the Emerald chicken. Overall the food was ok and your food comes out fast."}
{"text":"You got me all hot 'n bothered again. I added sriracha and holy mother fck! 

Jade red chicken, jerk chicken burrito and fried rice.

Chino Bandido, I want to marry you."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Been here a few times, and the food is pretty good ..it would be awesome if they were open late nite.  

The jerk fried rice, the jade red chicken, and the jen red pork are great and dont disappoint.  The pollo diablo has good kick, and the hengrenade chicken is pretty good too.  The machaca is kinda bland, but the hot sauce helps."}
{"text":"These 2 worlds come together in the best possible way. Love this place!  It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I admit is good and innovative, but hardly a 5 star winner, sorry, nice people, good service, good prices, food was good not great, will probably comeback sometime. but I would not go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Chino Bandido I was very skeptical. Asian and Mexican fusion? Sounds a bit weird. To add to my skepticism the place looks a little sketchy. But once we entered all my doubts were gone. We were welcomed by the friendliest staff who offered us all types of delicious samples. I ordered the Jade red chicken and the emerald chicken in a quesadilla. It was really delicious - but my favorite thing by far is there black beans. I don't know what they add to them but I dream about them they are so good. My husband had a chile relleno and the jen red pork with fried rice. The chile relleno was super cheesy and rolled in saltine crackers and then deep fried. 
Chino Bandido is definitely not a place for you if you are counting calories but if you are craving a delicious hearty meal it's for you!"}
{"text":"So a burrito and a wok chock full o' stir fry had a love child and out came this interesting fusion joint.  Don't expect nice furniture or top notch décor, it's a dive... but the food is so good it's endearing.  And if I remember right, they give you a fresh snickerdoodle cookie with every meal, win-win.

I haven't had a combo here I did not like, and the rice & beans they serve with whatever concoction you can imagine are really tasty.  I remember seeing the DDD episode of this before I ever moved to AZ and then once the east valley location closed down I just had a hard time making it out.

I'm glad I did and a few times a year I come back cause I'm craving random combinations like those they offer here.  The service is always friendly and the prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Totally worth your time!!"}
{"text":"3.5 or so

I like Chino. I always have. YET I have only been there about 6 times in my life. It is just something I do not crave. 

I had Jade Red Chicken. It was mildly spicy but still had a little flavor. The white rice was cooked perfectly. The snicker doodle was the highlight. 

Service is always great and the place still can use some cleaning."}
{"text":"Arizona soul food! I've been coming here my entire life for the most part, must try jade red chicken, must try gen red pork, best black beans in the state! Amazing jerk fried rice. Dip the snickerdoodle in your black refried beans, you won't be sorry! 

The perfect order: combo plate with 1Q & 8B, BlkBeans, JrkFrd Rice, snickerdoodle
(carnitas quesadilla, jen red pork burrito)

Prepare for an earth shattering mouth-gasm!"}
{"text":"They had our food ready pretty quick but it was not the best had the jerk chicken and carnitas with the black beans and jerk fried rice. The beans were more runny than I like and the carnitas had no flavor. Wasn't really impressed for my first visit. May try it again and order a different combination."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing! Emerald chicken Quesadilla, Jade Red Burrito, Jerk Fried Rice, And Black Beans!!! If you do not know what to get, ask for samples! Wish it was closer to Tempe/Scottsdale but make the drive out there you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"DO NOT LET THE DINGYNESS SWAY YOU! It does. It looks kind of gross inside. Lots of surfaces that used to be white. And I understand ordering may be difficult if it's your first time. Don't worry. They'll help you AND give you samples. I'm a fan of the Jade Red Chicken quesadilla with a side of Jade red Chicken, plain fried rice and refried beans. And a root beer. But I hear it's hard to go wrong. Food hits the spot every single time!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times.  It's always good....really good!  I order the 1&9 combo with refried beans and jerk fried rice...(.carnitas and jerk chicken with refried beans and jerk fried rice}.... Deeeelicious!  Just the right amount of spicy. It is always fun to watch newbies come in and try samples before ordering!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The jade chicken quesadillas are the best. The snicker doodle cookies are delicious. I would write more but I have to run and get some jade chicken"}
{"text":"Sorry Chino Bandido or should I say Chino Bad-Dido....I appreciate the concept - Chinese & Mexican food - I get haha - ha ... er well maybe I don't.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, don't get me wrong, I enjoy fusion dishes, but when you put my fried rice next to my refried beans and call it good; we have problems.  The decor? Well it's a warehouse that has fold-up tables and chairs all around.  What were they manufacturing?  Something they call Chinese-Mexican food, and you just happen to have your mouth open so enjoy!  I give it one star cause I like their mascot Mexican Panda!"}
{"text":"(egg fu yong - emerald chicken - jerk fried rice- no beans) and (chinese bbq pork - red jade chicken - chicken fried rice - beans):
Good but Nothing special. Taste was simple, nothing too complex.The meal comes with a free cookie.:)

The red chicken tastes like orange chicken from panda express. Although my boyfriend prefers panda express orange chicken over this. The chinese bbq pork has good flavor. 

Price is reasonable. Big servings. The lady who got our order was very friendly.. She explained to us the menu and was patiently waiting for us to order. 
It didnt live up to the hype but I'll go back if im in the area. It is a good asian-mexican-carribean fusion. It's different and sometimes, different is good.:)"}
{"text":"Ok, it's been way too long since I've update my last review... But I've been back a couple of times now over the past couple of months and here is my take;

Food~  yes it's still a \"gut bomb\" but not a \"total gut bomb\" if you order the right things and besides everything here is very tasty and addictive!!  I suggest getting the veggie quesadilla, Polo Diablo or Jade Chicken with the Jerk Fried Rice and skip the beans.  This is a very tasty dish and you'll take me later for ordering without the beans :-)

If you have been to Chino Bandido, you're in for a wild ride with some tasty Mexican-Asian Fusion dishes!!  Save room for their snickerdoodle cookie or if you wait and go on the weekend you might get lucky and get a Lava Cookie!! NOM, NOM, NOM!!

I'm looking forward to seeing you there!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Love the atmosphere! great staff friendly and fast. Gray place for lunch with coworkers."}
{"text":"Went back to Chino a few weeks ago.  Still good food.  I had the Emerald Chicken, Machaca Quesadilla, and the Jerk Fried Rice.  Emerald Chicken was good at first, but then the ginger just kinda took over.  I still liked it though, just maybe a little less of it.

Machaca Quesadilla is my fav.  Can't go wrong.

Dom loved it all, the way he was eating you would have thought it was his last meal!  

Morgan had the Chile Relleno, she liked the flavor but said the wrapper fell right off when cut it, it looked like filo dough?? strange. She also had the Chicken fried rice, which was better than my Jerk Rice... when will I learn that she is just better at ordering (she discovered my fav machaca)? 

OMG, now I totally have to go there again... I'm starving!

Only one complaint.  The sauces there are weird... they should buy my famous salsa, it would SO GO WITH EVERYTHING HERE!"}
{"text":"Yelp and Guy Feri got it right! Searching Yelp for Chinese in Phoenix directed us to this strange place that somehow works. Rather than being a fusion of both Chinese and Mexican, most of the dishes lean closer to one or the other category.

I definitely recommend getting the combo as getting a regular ends up being very plain (literally just white rice with whatever you choose). 

I opted for the vegetarian friendly combo: #2 Chile Relllano and #21 Veggie fajitas with a side of white rice and black beans. The Chile Rellano was deliciously cheesy but the veggies were too oily.

PS. This place is the opposite of eco-friendly, using all disposable dishes and utensils.. Booo!

#vegetarian review"}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  It isn't just a dive, it makes a Tijuana jail look clean.  I travel often and I have eaten in dumps all over the planet and this place is in the top 5 most disgusting.

This food will mess up your stomach.  I still have it sitting in my stomach 21 hours later.  Not to mention the fact that I think the wife got food poisoning. 

The wife had the jade red chicken and the chile relleno with the jerk rice and refried beans.  The jade red chicken was dry, the chile relleno was covered in crackers and the chile was raw, and the beans tasted like they came from a can.

I had the diablo chicken, jade red chicken, jerk rice, and refried beans.  Like I said, I'm pretty sure the beans are canned.  The diablo chicken was a little gamy and dry and the jade red was dry.  The jerk rice was ok.

Long story short?  Don't bother.  I don't know what Guy Fieri saw in this place."}
{"text":"Yes Drive Ins,diners and dives brought me to this place,you have to try this once...The concept is very interesting and there is a lot of options in the menu,great costumer service but ambiance needs a little work.
The food is good  solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Chinese Mexican? Really? My coworkers took me here and boy was I glad they did.

I love that they let you sample stuff before ordering. Smart move!

My first trip I got the jade chicken with the carnitas in a quesadilla. Comes with rice, beans and a snickerdoodle. For a great price, you can buy a meal big enough for 2.

That red chicken...THAT CHICKEN! It is perfectly glazed, with enough crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor. The carnitas broke my mouth it was so good. And that snickerdoodle! It was so good, we bought a bakers dozen. 

My second trip I tried the emerald chicken. I normally hate cold ginger chicken. It's all in that sauce and they perfected that recipe.

I love that they serve their meals in a foil take out pan. If you can't finish it, you grab a lid and go. Nice.

If only they could open one in Hawaii...."}
{"text":"I can't think of another establishment that does Chinese/Mexican fusion cuisine as perfectly as Chino. 

While there may be more grease than you're expecting, the food is still amazing and definitely a guilty pleasure. The jade red chicken quesadilla is the bomb - get it every time!!"}
{"text":"somehow, i've avoided eating here for all 4 1/2 years that i've lived in Phoenix till now. And the really funny thing is, I live within a couple miles of this location. And my family eats there every once in a while. And my bf worked at a CB one summer, prior to us dating. 
But enough about me - on to the food!

I like that you can do whatever you want to the food! That's probably one of the cool things - ie you can take the Emerald Chicken (simply cooked chicken covered in a green ginger/onion chunky sauce) 'and get it in a quesadilla! genius, and pretty tasty too. the pork fried rice was pretty tasty, and the black beans? good. very good. 

and what i don't recommend? the egg foo young - pretty tasteless. and the jerk chicken is really not like the jamaican jerk chicken i tasted in jamaica, so kinda disappointing. overall... i wasn't that impressed. and if i've learned anything at all - you can't trust that diners, drive-ins, and dives show on the Food Network! that's 2 strikes for Guy F. in Phoenix, from me!

i'd come back, but only if i really had no choice. and then i'd only order that emerald chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"An odd combination, and yet surprisingly delicious!! You can sample any of the meat options before submitting your order. The staff is usually friendly and will assist you if you're new and not sure how to fill out the order form. Food is ready usually in 10-15 minutes. I usually call ahead, so that my order is ready for pickup. You can eat-in as they have ample seating. If you like snickerdoodle cookies, then you're in for a treat! Those are included with your order. 

We usually get a quesadilla and a burrito combo. The jade red chicken is the house favorite and one of ours too! It's in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you. Per usual, the more run down restaurants look, the tastier the cuisine."}
{"text":"One of the places i went to when i visited phoenix. This place is pretty interesting, first time i encountered a chinese-mexican fusion.

It did not disappoint though. I tried their jerk chicken, jade red chicken, rice and beans. They were pretty good.

I dont see myself going back to Phoenix but just in case i do, i might go and stop by this place again."}
{"text":"Where do I begin!? Oh yeah, RED JADE CHICKEN. Put that meat on anything and you got a hit. I recently put it in a quesadilla and felt like I was wearing gold plated sneakers. Just go get this place TODAY"}
{"text":"Get a jade red quesadilla and the chille relleno.  this place is a staple in life. The laid back vibes means you can go there in sweat pants and no one gives a darn."}
{"text":"Large area. Didnt get the menu, bare with me i was a first time customer who was in a lunch break. Finally figured it out after 5 minutes, tried the jade chicken it was meh not special. Quesadillas are a bit hard. Nope not coming back."}
{"text":"This place deserves nothing less than five stars.  If I could give it ten I would.  There is so much great with this place.  

First to the people who put down the building and seating you are crazy loco.  Yes you sit at foldable tables and it's more community seating than private but that just fits the feel and the food.  

The food is down right dirty delicious food.  It could easily be featured on the chive.  It's cheap, tasty and served up fast and hot.  The cookies are a perfect top off to the meal.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I promise."}
{"text":"Bomb fusion food. Everything I've ever tried has been phenomenal. I've been going there for a few years now and still love it every time. :D"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!  So damn good!!  Bwa!  I love it!!  YES!!  Now please bring one to LA!"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.  Go. Just go.  Red chicken is a must. But it's All good.
Adventurous?  Ask staff to choose"}
{"text":"Just as good as ever! This place was a favorite when I lived in Phoenix back in 2003/2004 and was pregnant. Every time I spoke to anyone about living there I would always mention this place. After moving to Chandler I couldn't wait to come back to visit. Took us an hour and sooo worth it! The pork fried rice and carnitas quesadillas are so good and now my 12 year old is hooked too!"}
{"text":"Deliciousssss!!! And I don't even like Chinese food! But their combination of Chinese and Mexican is awesome!"}
{"text":"My mom insisted on this being her first stop when she arrived in Phoenix. She saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and she loved the concept. So off we went. It does look like a dive, but it was clean and that is what matters the most. The young lady behind the counter was the most patient woman ever and let us try just about everything so that we could make up our minds as to what we wanted. I have no idea what they put in those refried beans, but baby they are some good eats. I could have had a bowl of that with the jerk fried rice and I would have been happy. My mom wanted a little bit of it all, so ordered a carnita burrito, jade chicken, beans, and jerk fried rice. I kept it simple with just the jerk fried rice and the jerk chicken. (Hey I was already full from all the samples, don't judge me) Everything was so good. We had left overs the for lunch the next day. Mom was extremely pleased and needless to say that on her next visit, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Once you get over the fact that this place is a hole in the wall dive (which is a positive in my book), prepare to be impressed.

We've lived in the Valley almost 8 years and never gotten around to eating here. Now that we have, we'll definitely be back. The free samples of their most popular dishes was helpful since I'm not crazy about spicy food. I had the Emerald chicken with fried rice. The sauce over the chicken was awesome. My only issue was that there were way too many green onions in the fried rice, but that's a minor thing. Next time I'll just get plain rice. Hubby had the Red chicken and a few other things I don't remember, and said they were good. And of course, the snickerdoodles were totally a random thing but delicious.

Even better, this place is CHEAP!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Chino that hasn't been said already? I was introduced by a couple of IT geek friends - yes, it really is a geek hotspot, with good proximity to some of the biggest IT employers in the Valley. I was initially intimidated by the ordering system, but it's really not that difficult after a couple-three repetitions (and believe me, after one visit you WILL be back). The samples were invaluable in helping me understand the different flavors and textures.

And oh my %DEITY%, what flavors and textures. Whether you like it mouth-scorchingly hot or mild and sweet or both at the same time, Chino has something for you. 

The ambience? Frankly, who cares? It's a low-class dive and that's how the regulars like it. Bring on the grub and let the peeling walls and stained floors look after themselves.

I live 49.6 miles from Chino North and even further from the Chandler location, and I still make a point of taking my daughter there monthly. I usually get Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, pork fried rice and black beans (with Sobe Lean from the fountain because, you know, I'm just that health-conscious), but I've tried everything on the menu and it's all great.

Seriously, if you've never been, you need to at least give Chino a try. Just be warned, it's addictive. About the only thing that could make it better is if they delivered.

PS: VOLCANO COOKIES FTW."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO *breath* OOOOOOOOOOOOOO *bereft weeping and rending of garments*

Chino, I LOVED you! How could you do this to me?!"}
{"text":"the jerk chicken is excellent and so is the ruby chicken. jerk is very spicy and addicting. we get it for take out all the time. very unique."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the atmosphere. There is always one way to impress a customer, good service and great food! The employees came through. The food was good."}
{"text":"Emerald chicken is amazing! Seriously if you haven't tried this place you HAVE to try it. You can even sample the most popular dishes to find your favorite"}
{"text":"To be brief: I am a huge fan of Cho Bandido's.  My family has eating at this restaurant for well over a decade.  The food is always great, and my best advice would be to avoid the long lines during lunch and dinner hours and just eat at the \"odd\" hours.  

My past few visits this year I have been greeted and served by some really energetic and friendly ladies and gentlemen.  However, my last visit my order was taken by a man named Lien. I have only ever worked in customer service positions myself, and have never come across someone so rude and unprofessional.  

In writing this review I was thinking about giving a 3 star review just for this reason.  But as this is a wonderful place that I have been coming back to for years and years, despite a recent poor experience I still have to give credit where credit is due with 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Don't be put off by the appearance, the concept, or the location. It's not really fusion so much as collaboration.  Jade Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice with black beans is an amazing flavor combination.  On paper it sounds almost disgusting, but it is so good!!!  

Staff is friendly and upbeat, and the prices are affordable.  Take out/Dine in, either way it's worth the drive from wherever you are!"}
{"text":"Hmmm... what can I say about this place?  It's ambiance is equivalent to a little dive bar.  You walk in, and order to the left, take a number then go and sit to the right sitting area which seemed a little ghetto and self serve plastic knives, forks, etc.

We asked for suggestions when ordering and got the Jerk chicken fried rice, with Chile relleno and Jade Red Chicken.  The lady behind the counter asked for my name and couldn't spell it (my name is Teresa... like Mother Teresa.  It's not that hard!).  Was surprised, but whatever.

Food: The Chili relleno was AWESOME!!!  It was breaded with Cheese-its!!  Not greasy, but the breading was a bit thick, that I ended up having to cut away half of the bread per bite cause it was too much.  The Jerk Chicken Fried rice was ok; regular fried rice with jerk chicken in it.  Lastly, the Jade Red Chicken was just like the greasy, fried Orange chicken of Panda Express.

Overall, the experience was interesting, food was ok.  The only 'WOW' factor was the pairing... cheese-it chili relleno with fried rice.  If I'm in the area, I would probably stop by for the chili relleno, but I wouldn't make a special trip just for their food."}
{"text":"Chinese and mexican together?! Yes please! This place is really great and I can't believe tonight was my first time trying it!! Location is a little hidden but once you pass Dobson, it's clearly visible (turn right after Circle K). Restaurant is really large and staff was really friendly. Since it was my first time in, they let me sample a few of their menu items. I thought that was really cool! I ended up ordering the jade chicken (similar to sweet and sour), gringo chicken in a quesadilla with chicken fried rice and refried beans. We ordered to go and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. When we got home, I was excited to try all the food! Quesadilla was amazing...jade chicken great, beans good and rice was OK. I LOVE that they give you a warm snicker doodle too! Cookie was really good and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, this place is great and will return soon!"}
{"text":"I had my first visit there and I was very impressed.  We told the cashier that it was our first time and they were great at letting us try things out and learning how to fill out the ordering ticket.

I ended up getting the imperial quesadilla, jerk fried rice, beans and jerk burrito.  My favs were the imperial quesadilla and the beans.  They were delish.  The food is a tad on the greasy side, so just be prepared.  Otherwise my husband and i shared the combo listed above and we still had some to take home.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix most of my life, but didn't try this place until a couple of months ago. What was I thinking?!? This place is awesome! I was a little concerned about the \"fusion\" of Asian and Mexican food, but I shouldn't have been. The food is delicious. They even let you try samples at the counter! My favorite is the red jade chicken, but really...IT'S ALL GOOD! And, they bring you a tasty little Snickerdoodle cookie with your meal, which makes the whole visit worthwhile. I would give it five stars, but the only drawback is the place looks really dirty. If you can get past that, however, you are in for a treat. Try it. You'll like it."}
{"text":"Amazing food in this dive! The samples sure do sell ya! This is my first time and won't be my last. The food has interesting (GREAT interesting) mixes of Asian and Mexican cuisines.


Way to go Chino!"}
{"text":"Good service, neat concept but the food isn't perfect. I need to try different combos to find the right flavor mix. A bit of tweaking, this place could be the next Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. Service was quick and the employees were nice and helpful. The jade red chicken is great!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of stuff for what you pay, decent food and no huge negatives. Just wished i had more meat for what i paid instead of barely any"}
{"text":"I Chino'd your Bandido! 
Translation: You sunk a rock into my belly 

Fun concept (they can explain), mediocre to good food. 

Pros: 
- They let you sample their most popular meats 
- 2 tastes in one (Mexican and Asian fusion) 
- The Panda has a Mexican style mustache (almost got them 4 stars)! 

Cons: 
- The food is ok, and sits like a rock in your gut 
- Atmosphere in the dining room is nonexistent 

The best meat was the Jen Red Pork. 

This is a place I would definitely recommend to try once, especially since it so light on the wallet. However, once will be enough for me."}
{"text":"So I am from Washington state and one of the first restaurants I was told about was Chino Bandido. I forgot all about the place until I watched an old episode of DD&D on Food network 

Decided to come by and I have to say I can understand  why  the place  is such an iconic Phx location.

Quirky menu, understated decor, and really good food! The red jade pork is one of the most unique dishes I have ever had and I can't wait to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Definitely not a place to bring someone on a first date, but if your in the mood for good take-out, it's a great place to go. Food's not expensive here and most nights you'll see a mix of college age kids and families. Jade Red Chicken is one that you have to try."}
{"text":"First time here, I got the Hengrande chicken. It was really good. Lots of flavor, bit spicy, and they threw in a cookie. Everything was good. I just wished they had a side of veggies too. It was all meat and rice which is fine. It's not my business. I just thought veggies would ballance the meal. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back again. Happy eatings guys!"}
{"text":"Um, do people have no taste buds at all? Look, I give it two stars because it's a cool idea and because it's just fast food, so you can't expect much.

But this food is vile. I didn't finish mine, which says a lot. It's not even panda express quality. How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla and orange chicken (which I'm pretty sure they just defrost anyway)? 

Too bad. I think it's surviving entirely on its concept."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great mix on Mexican and Asian cuisine. I had the red chicken and fried rice (pictured). They let you try samples of everything, which is amazing! They have a single meat plate or a combo plate where you can choose multiple things. And they give you an snickerdoodle cookie with every meal. And the price is good! For my fountain drink and single combo plate I paid $11"}
{"text":"I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.

Finally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie?"}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest here and say that this place is terrible.... For my diet. Holy crap this place is great! So as a newbie and not knowing how awesome it was, the fact that they let you try things before you buy is a fantastic business decision.  I've tried everything, but my 'go-to' items are the emerald chicken and jade chicken. I could eat the black beans and jerk fried rice every single day but again, very bad for my carb intake. So make this your cheat meal spot and go have the best food ever! Seriously who thought of having Asian and Mexican together?! Well I could kiss them!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to deliver. I have tried many different things and everything has been outstanding. Today I had the pollo Diablo and jade red pork. The Diablo had the perfect amount of heat. You MUST have the black beans- the best I have ever had"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is awesome. I eat here about once a month and each time I leave completely satisfied. I've tried most of their options, but the black beans are the best things on the menu. Try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The food is always delicious and the employees are really helpful if you're not familiar with the menu. I really wish they would update the dinning area though."}
{"text":"I like the concept and think for $7 you get a very filling, tasty, unique lunch.

So many different options for fried rice and beans, also so many different ways you can have your meats. On a plate like panda express, or you can have them throw it into a small quesadilla or small burrito. 

Not somewhere I eat often. But definitely something I'll crave randomly, because the flavors are really good for fast food"}
{"text":"Great food finds a way to distract me from other things like service or atmosphere.  I have been here several times and the food is amazing.  The atmosphere is somewhat non-existent, the building is a little shabby and there isn't much in the decor category and you know what, I don't care.  It's divey, get over it.  But if you want great food unlike anything you find elsewhere, this is the spot.  The service is always great and friendly.  I've not been too many places where they will let you sample the different dishes before you buy them.  I love this because the fusion of Mexican and Asian is unlike anything else and it's great to be able to try it before you commit.  

The ordering system is somewhat unorthodox but the employees are always willing to help you get exactly what you want.  My regular favorite is the jade red chicken, handgrenade chicken in a quesadilla, the black beans and the jerk-fried rice.  The best part is, the perfectly baked snicker doodle cookie they throw in.  

I dont give 5 stars easily but this place is fast, fresh and full of flavor.  For that, they earn my vote."}
{"text":"Cool concept, bad execution.  It tasted like the they took the left overs from Panda Express and one those \"A___erto's\" Mexican joints and threw them in a foil plate."}
{"text":"Order: jade red chicken, chile relleno, jerk fried rice and black beans = $8

Looked good in pics but not tasty. The only item that was hot off the grill was the chile relleno. Chile relleno crust was too thick (took it off) and just ate the small chile stuffed with cheese in the middle. Rice and red chicken was dry, tasted like been sitting out for awhile wasn't even warm.

Not sure if the quality has gone down since food network gave it all the hype...but as a first timer I don't plan on coming back, nothing stood out. I would rather eat Panda Express and Taco Bell together"}
{"text":"My friends told me about this place and I'm glad they did. Came here again 5 more times cause this place is very good. The people are very generous. Service is good. Food is very good and the prices aren't that bad. Everyone should stop by and check this place out. Also a TV to watch while you wait for the food"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time it has been Awesome. Food is fresh and hot...did I mention Awesome!! Only giving 4 stars because dining room interior could use a major over hall. Which I would totally recommend the owners look into. With food that good, give us a nice spot to relax enjoy a drink and your Bomb.com food."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much here but what I get is so good I don't have to stray. I always get the jerk fried rice and jade red chicken.

The jerk fried rice has junks of jerk chicken, very tasty. The jade red chicken is always terrific.

The free snicker doodle cookie is great too."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Jade Red Chicken is amazing. I've been eating here for 10 years."}
{"text":"I was finally able to satisfy my drought for decent Mexican food when some friends took me here for dinner! Let me tell you there are Rey few Mexican food options in Honolulu and I was quite happy with this place. A bit chaotic up front, no one seems to know how to place an order. Way too many options and permutations on items to order! However, when the food finally comes (and it comes quick), its really awesome! I tried the combination dish with carne asana along with the pork fried rice. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Only complaint, make the menu selection easier. This was our first time and luckily the staff was so amazing! Made recommendations and helped ordered. If you have t been try it out! Black beans are puréed which is funky, but yummy!"}
{"text":"I still love this place and their Mexican/Chinese fusion. They've changed a bit but the food is still very good!"}
{"text":"Though they are always busy, their food is amazing and ive never had a problem with any of the staff. Only thing I say you need to improve on is getting an additional location. It sucks having to drive far to enjoy such great food."}
{"text":"The truth is - every review comparing this place to a \"cafeteria\" is right on money. The seating, quality of food, presentation of ALL dishes in an aluminum bowl, and the tiny plastic utensils all reminded me of a school lunch! No hair nets in sight, but were likely within reach. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone with moderately advanced taste buds. Only those who want to give this novelty restaurant (and their bodies) a try- and even then I'd recommend the Phoenix location. The cookies were, however, surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"There black beans are so amazing!! That's what's going to keep me coming back! I went there for the first time and it was awesome! The people there are awesome very friendly and very helpful. Since it was my first time I had a lot of questions about the menu and what was in certain plates but the server was very patient with me and answered all my questions in the most polite way possible. I'm sure they have other amazing dishes that I am so willing to try out!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have the words for how awesome this place is.  I mean how has this not blown up before.  Mexican & Asian food all on the same menu and combined?  It is everything I love and it is so wrong that it is so right.

I look at the menu in awe and just grin about the damage I am getting ready to do.   It would be wise for me to list out all of the concoctions and requests but I can't remember.  I know that they were on DDD but a friend of mine took me here and don't go very often but when I do....it is on.  

Just do it....do it....do it...."}
{"text":"I got the red jade chicken and jerk chicken rice. I came here because it was on the food network. It really wasn't that good. It was just ok. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"I have moved to the area over a year and a half ago and glad to say that I was finally able to visit this innovative Chinese- Mexican cuisine! The menu is so unique blending Mexican traditional dishes with Chinese flavors. Today I went with the roasted pork and fried rice . I do like that they have a mini menu where you have the option of selecting a variety of rices. Like I said before the flavors were amazing and the dish was prepared in under 5 minutes . I was very satisfied with my meal and excited to return and try out the other dishes !"}
{"text":"It was ok. It is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies. They combined a Panda Express with a Taco Bell into one dish. Also the fried rice was terrible"}
{"text":"I just didn't get it.  The people/service are great.  Maybe I ordered the wrong menu items for my taste buds but I wasn't that impressed with the food.  And the pork had a bunch of fat.  I had the cookie for mid afternoon snack and it was really good.  They certainly have plenty of fans, there was 20-30 people in line at lunch the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Definitely highly recommended! You wantgood portions,  them come here!!"}
{"text":"Uniquely awesome! Just don't eat here too often, or you will weigh more than a saguaro cactus. Whether you live in PHX or are just visiting, you have to check out Chino Bandito."}
{"text":"This place makes me entirely too happy! Amazing laid back atmosphere, great food (Jade Red chicken & Jerk Fried Rice!), Alcoholic drinks if you choose, sports always on the television, fast-friendly staff- what more can you ask for!? 

LOVE CHINOS!"}
{"text":"Great cominations and surpringly a great fusion spot. Be sure to take some samples before you order at the front so you can find out what you'll like. Emerald Green chicken quesadilla . The cookies are a welcomed ending to your meal and are the bomb.com."}
{"text":"Unbelievable I've been eating at this restaurant for 20 years when it used to be excellent quality of the food has been slipping a little bit lately but I still been ordering there at least once a week today I place an order at 8:56 and I sent my son to go pick it up they close at 9 o'clock he gets there about 10 after nine and they told him they threw the food out
I wonder if the owner knows this I know restaurant workers are in a hurry to get home but really you can close the restaurant at nine and be gone by 910they only knew how disappointed I was"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place, but I was not a FAN! I got the combo with BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice.  The BBQ pork was not GOOD at all, chewy and tough to eat.  The teryiyaki chicken was even worse, the sauce was a clump of jello like substance.  GROSS!  The fried rice was so soggy and the beans did not go with the rest of the food.  =(

They have a friendly staff and hurdle customers in like cattle."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back at least once a week. Make sure you try the jerk rice! 

After the first and second time since trying I've had the jerk rice and jerk chicken several times for dinner/lunch. It's always as good as the first time."}
{"text":"Though I like the concept and the funny panda mascot, I'm not sure what to think of this place.  The customer service was outstanding... we got a detailed menu explanation and samples when we arrived (because we'd never been there before and they weren't too busy) but the space itself lacked any appeal.  The food was... good enough.  My Jerk Chicken Quesadilla was goodish and the Carnitas tastes like Hawaiian kalua pork, which was ok, just not what I was expecting, I guess.

It was all just ok.  Maybe it's just because we went on a rainy, dreary day and there were only 2 other tables there.  The empty atmosphere and 'good enough' food drained me, I think.  I felt like I was in an abandoned mess hall that served things I wasn't in the mood for.  My friend really liked it but, I probably wouldn't go back unless other friends really wanted me to meet them there.  Because of our difference of opinions, I'll bump my 2.5 stars up to 3.

Prolly won't see ya there."}
{"text":"Wow! yummy!  Chinos is the bomb!  Mexican-Asian fusion at its finest, I can't explain it, but a delight to the taste buds. Cashier was more than accommodating in helping with my selections. I make it a habit to ask for recommendations when I visit a business for the first time...totally satisfied!  Ambience leaves much to be desired, but who notices when all you can do is not take your eyes off what you're consuming!  I'll be back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Chino bandido is an Asian-mex infusion the staff is very helpful and sweet they recommended the tastiest. I ordered and will only be ordering the combination plate that feeds a hun dry stomach generously. The options were plentiful if you prefer a bit of spicy I recommend jade chicken, pinto beans , jerk fried rice , and machaca quesadilla"}
{"text":"Great food. Really liked having the system explained and samples provided when we walked in. This place has character. The dining area could use a little updating. Prices are reasonable. Food is served in aluminum pie pans, which is kind of cool but vaguely makes me worry about recycling. Everyone was super friendly. We were out of state and stopped by on the way to the airport  because of the reviews and the Guy Fieri reference."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Have been hooked for years and will continue to recommend and come back for years to come!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I loved everything about it. I don't live in Arizona so when I heard about chino my boyfriend and I came down and had to see what the buzz is all about. I got the jade chicken with beans and jerk rice and It was absolutely amazing! Service is great and friendly. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed this restaurant but I didn't.  I ordered Jerk chicken and I expected Jerk chicken to be spicy with a little sweet but it was too spicy for me to eat. The service was good and friendly and my husband and kids liked the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! 
I've been there twice this week! 
The jerk chicken is absolutely yummy! But honestly everything on the menu that I've tried so far is great! 
Ordering for first timers is a little confusing, but if you go up to the guy at the counter on the left he will help u out and give u some samples :)
By my second visit I knew the deal and was able to get in and out a lot faster.
The snickerdoodle cookie was the bomb, and I tried a special cookie yesterday that was chocolatey and soooo gooooood! 
I can't wait to be back in AZ so I can go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great concept with good staff but missed the five stars from average execution. All the reviews raved about jerk fried rice. It was like warm and almost dry but with all the fun stuff in it I can see how it could be great. The jerk chicken was barely warm and that took something away from it. The machaca and black beans and the sauce you put on the juicy jade chicken are top notch. This whole meal need sauce and I was half finished when I saw people with sides of sauce. 

I would come back just because the unique blend of flavors and potential to be awesome. Maybe if I converted (a option when you order) some of the stuff to a burrito it would come out hotter? All meals are served with a cookie."}
{"text":"Maybe the best thing in Arizona. A combo of Chinese & Mexican food. Had a quick, fulfilling lunch of emerald quesadillas, black beans and root beer. Love the samples to start off for newcomers. That made a real difference in what i picked and ensured that i was a happy diner. Cool."}
{"text":"Unique, fun, funky, tasty, divey.  Chino Bandido is a bizarro mix of chinese and mexican.  Order up front (their way or the highway).  Big portions served in tin-foil to-go containers.  Mostly clean seating area with big community tables and some smaller 2/4/6-tops.  Love the Jade Red Chicken -- sweet and spicy.  Whatever you order, make sure to get the black beans (and rice) as a side; they taste like nothing else.  Snickerdoodle cookie (great) comes with every entree, or a mudslide cookie (awesome) on the weekends.  Only downside is sketch service -- try to avoid dinner rush, where you may wait in line for 15-30 minutes to order and 30 minutes or more for your food to arrive."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here everyday.  I love the Handgrenade Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Snickerdoodle to go!"}
{"text":"Yet again we come to another restaurant i have been to multiple times but have not reviewed until now. But i have had tried a good number of the meats on the menu to give you some insight if you have never been there or you have not tried something in particular.

First thing, I have never had any problem with the customer service at this location thank god= 1 star.
Food:
Carnitas- The only thing on the menu i would get multiple times next to the jade red chicken(spicier version of like a sweet and sour chicken but better flavor!) Now for the carnitas its got such awesome flavors i mean not mind blowing OH MY GOD flavors where you make those stupid rachel ray moments where you can not help it but good enough to where you can order it multiple times because its not boring or bland.
I cannot stress to you how much i hate the rest of some of the chickens on the menu like the teriyaki chicken or the emerald(my friend LOVES this one. I HATE IT i try to like it on plenty occasions like today and since they use this sliced chicken that are like flat strips or thicker strips of deli chicken you get from frys, with some okay sauce that had so much potential it fails to catch me every time no matter how i eat it, in a quesadilla, burrito, plain, you name it. JUST DISAPPOINTING!)

The jerk chicken is good for those who love REALLY SPICY kicks!
The henegrade or whatever is below it but i didn't care for that either.
i needed something closer to the jerk but not that intense. I can eat the jerk chicken fried rice but not extra jerk chicken.

The combo plates come with two types of meat however you want it plain, quesadilla, or burrito. Fried rice is extra, white rice is included unless you pay extra. Beans you get either re fried or the spicy cuban black beans. I just get extra jerk chicken fried rice in my combo plate.
The hot sauce/salsa whatever is now pre packaged for you near the fountain soda machine so you don't make a mess pouring it into cups.

My other favorite item on the menu that comes with your combo plate is a cookie weekdays is snicker doodle which are AMAZING but on weekends is the volcano cookie which is like a brownie cookie which is my personal favorite!!! minus the powdered sugar that falls all over the place so eat with caution or a napkin below your mouth so don't look like an idiot. 
the food gets a star and the cookie gets its own star. I don't want to rate them any higher than a 3 because i don't love chino that much to call myself a fan.  Why i continue to go here is to change it up once in awhile every couple months to get my boyfriend the carnitas and jade red chicken. I love their cookies more than their meats but i wont come here just for cookies. Because the price i pay for their combo plates i don't find it worth that 8 dollars and something cents."}
{"text":"Saw the Guy Fieri's show. went to chandler location. worst food I ever had. barely warm greasy fried chicken, jerk chicken tough and greasy. shredded beef was so over salted I gagged! presentation looked like a plate of garbage. We sent back the teriyaki chicken as it was undercooked! rice was under-seasoned ,cold and oily. nothing tasted fresh..shame on them."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal at Chino Bandido was the free snickerdoodle cookie.  On the outside, it had a flaky crust with a dusting of cinnamon, and on the inside, it was warm and chewy.  Oh yeahhhh!!!!  Unfortunately, when the best part of the meal is the free desert, then Phoenix, we have a problem.  I feel really bad about giving this place a bad review, especially since they were so nice about giving free samples before I ordered.  Unfortunately, from my experience, it really is all hype here.  As I tried the samples, most of the Chinese dishes, including the signature Jade Red Chicken, were either overly sweet or not spicy enough.  Even if this place is an inexpensive hole-in-the-wall, I expected much better since it was featured on DDD, but especially because their website says one of the co-founders is of Chinese descent.  The only other Mexican dish to sample besides carnitas was the pollo diablo which tasted more Chinese than Mexican.

By the time I finished trying all the samples, however, I felt obligated to give this place a try, so I ordered the combo with jerk fried rice, emerald chicken, carnitas wrapped as a burrito, and refried beans for about $7.25. At first, it seemed like there would be almost too much food because the combos come in nice big aluminum take-out pans, but instead of serving all the items on top of a steaming gut-busting bed of jerk rice, mine had only a 1/3-pan wedge of rice to the side of the other items.  Come on guys....rice does not cost that much!  Even the combos from Chinese fast food take-outs in strip malls come with more rice!

The jerk rice was salty and slightly spicy but did not have that habanero allspice garlicky cinnamon nutmeg taste I usually associate with jerk seasoning.  The pulled pork that passed for carnitas did not taste as if it was slow roasted nor was it seasoned with anything other than salt.  It was simply a greasy stale wad of shredded pork wrapped in a tortilla without any salsa, guacamole, or cilantro to make it more interesting.  The refried beans had a meager sprinkling of melted cheese but were otherwise bland and pasty.  The best part of the main meal was the emerald chicken which consisted of sliced chicken breast meat covered with an overly-salted, but flavorful, green onion & ginger sauce, but it seemed as if the sauce was simply poured onto unmarinated chicken.  The pathetic metal stand they called a \"salsa bar\" had plastic eating utensils, napkins, soy sauce packets, and siracha sauce packets...but no salsa!

Now, some people have characterized this place as fusion cuisine.  I don't mean to be a gourmet snob, but the food here is definitely not fusion!  It's simply a hodge podge of dishes from different cuisines put side-by-side onto the same plate, similar to a \"Hawaiian plate lunch.\"  If Chino Bandido had actually synergized Chinese and Mexican foods into unique new creations, such as crispy fried wontons filled with carne asada & queso fresco with a side of Sichuan peppercorn-spiced bean dip, steamed chipotle-lime crystal shrimp dumplings (har gow), or hoisin mole sauce-smothered enchiladas stuffed with shredded Hunan beef & roasted pasilla chiles and garnished with cebollitas & pomegranate seeds, well then, my friends...I would call this fusion!  As it is, the combination of Chinese and Mexican food, or at least their version of it, clashes.  If you crave heavily-Americanized Chinese food served with a lackluster attempt at Mexican food, then this is the destination for you!  Although their food is edible, the weak and unremarkable flavors here carry more weight towards my enjoyment of the meal than their intriguing idea of serving Chinese and Mexican dishes together.  I can otherwise find much better Mexican food down the road at one of those cheap fast-food burrito stands and better Chinese food at a shopping mall food court."}
{"text":"Always tasty! Service the last couple times was super slow even though it wasn't very busy and my my order was given to me incorrectly (first time in years)"}
{"text":"Four people within 2 weeks mentioned this place and one of them had seen it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives..so Ive been dying to check it out. Today was the day. We arrive and it's in a little strip mall in an area that I have never had to drive through to go anywhere.Meaning  had it not been for word of mouth I would have never known this place existed! They ask if it's your first time and when you say yes they proceed to give you samples of their top dishes. I ordered a combo: Black beans, jerk fried rice, pollo diablo and emerald chicken. I can't even explain the flavor explosion that erupted. Emerald Chicken cannot be beat, it was dare I say orgasmic. In addition to the flavor fiesta you get a free freakin big ass doughy cookie!! A Snickerdoodle was this weeks cookie...not many even know what a Snickerdoodle is let alone make the best Snickerdoodle ever to be devoured. This place is beyond words! Just go..GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Their jerk chicken fried rice is everything!!! Please make sure to get this! Love their different combos and the staff is always open to helping you decide!"}
{"text":"After all the hype from my friends, I decided to visit Chino Bandino.

I was somewhat disappointed. I got the dual meat combo. The jade option was spicy but lackluster in flavor. The carnita was super salty! Not the best tasting either. Black beans seemed low quality too.

The prices are good- but the quality and taste was not there."}
{"text":"A perfect storm of Asian and Mexican flavors!!"}
{"text":"Chino is chino! My favorite things to get or the red jade pork jerk rice and black beans! Oh and can't forget the cookies!!! Good shit!"}
{"text":"After driving past this joint for years and never stopping in,  I finally saw it on tv on diners drive ins and dives with Guy Fieri. I figured,  if he ate there and lived,  it must not be so bad! 

Staff is super friendly and helpful, they realize it's confusing of you've never been there before.

The pork is outstanding,  my favorite.  The jade chicken comes in at a close second!

Fun place to eat and break the norm, unless fusion food is your norm!

Go give then a try,  you'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place one star, but the free cookie deserved an extra star.  The snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious.  As for the rest of the food, it was not worth the money or the calories.  We saw this place on an old episode of DDD and decided it was time we try it.  They make it look A LOT better on tv than it is in real life.  Two couples walked in after us and they both received food ten minutes before we received ours.  I guess a quesadilla takes ten minutes to cook??  Try other DDD places, NOT this one."}
{"text":"The food is good and tasty! I was impressed but omg the tables and chairs and paint on the walls need to be updated to 2017! Everything inside reminds me of the early 90s all dated! And it's not that clean. They can charge a little more and get someone to clean up the place and stay on top of it. Take it go!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting combination of Mexican and Asian foods. Get all Mexican, all Asian, or a combination. You get a lot of food for not a lot of money, but my first visit wasn't life changing or anything, just better than the alternative choices in the fast food varieties of the same types of food. If in the area looking for decently priced food I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Jade chicken with jerk rice and make sure you get it in a burro. Make sure you go to the counter and tell them its your first time the helpful servers will give you a taste test and help you fill out the order firm."}
{"text":"Ambiance:
This restaurant was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins. Chino Bandido is the very definition of dive.  

Service:
Pleasant and fast. Some staffs were friendlier than the other. Unfortunately for us, we got the other.

Food:
Because of all the food trucks in LA and OC, I knew that Mexican and Asian combo is a winner. While the dishes I've tried in Socal are Mexican and Asian cuisines fused together to create a dish, at Chino Bandido, Mexican and Asian dishes are separate but are served together. 

After sampling several items, I decided to get Jerk Fried Rice bowl with Jade Red Chicken. Jade Red Chicken was quite similar to but definitely more flavorful than Orange Chicken. Jerk Fried Rice on the other hand, is basically a Chinese-style fried rice with small cubes of jerk chicken. The smokiness and spiciness from jerk chicken went really well the sweeter Jade Red Chicken. 

Cost Performance:
The cost was under $7 excluding tip. Considering the serving portion (while not generous, it was more than enough for a person with average appetite) and the quality of the food, the cost performance is pretty good."}
{"text":"I went here as the first stop of my cross country road trip with my sister.  I saw it as part of Diners Drive ins and Dives, the show on the food network, and I was determined to eat at some on our way across country.  The concept is Chinese and Mexican food together.  As we walked in the woman at the counter greeted us and asked if we had been in before.  When we said no, she offered us samples of their top 6 or so dishes.  That was AWESOME! We got to try the black beans, which I LOVED. so much so that I had to get a combo.. We also tried the jade chicken, emerald chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice.  I was interested in the Pollo Diablo, and when I said that the lady brought me a sample of that.  It was crispy a little spicy and delicious.  My sister and I ordered a combo with jerk fried rice and the awesome black beans, she opted for the Jade Red Chicken, their most popular,  and I got the Pollo Diablo Quesadilla.  One would think a fried chicken quesadilla might be a little odd, but it was amazing.  The refried cuban black beans are so flavorful I could eat those alone!   I will have to go back when I visit my grandma in Glendale again.  

Oh and the cookies.. yum yum!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Best Mexican Asian I have ever had!!! I have been here probably 5 times and it's just as good as the first time. I will forever go here and recommend this place. Customer service is always amazing."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the worst eating experiences I've had in a long time. Chino's used to have a restaurant in South Chandler that I actually enjoyed. When they closed I was disappointed as going to their other location would be quite the road trip. My family was in the area due to helping out a friend so decided it's a great chance to get our Chino's fix. I was so very wrong...

First thing that hits you when you enter this Chino's, the smell...I believe it was either sewage or just \"bathroom\" odor that permeated the restaurant. The service person that was taking out order was pretty rude during the order process (not once asking us if we wanted to sample anything). I had filled out two forms as I thought that was the process for ordering but he quickly gave me an odd look and said he needed to redo my written order properly...

Finding a clean table (which wasn't an issue at the S. Chandler Chino's) was a journey. Everything was dirty and all the tables looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a long time. 

Once we got our food that was when the true disappointment began. My Emerald Chicken had tendons and gristle in it (not appetizing at all), and my Jade chicken was essentially fried but without any real sauce at all. The Emerald Chicken also had an overwhelming amount of ginger minced in it. The black beans that I used to love were VERY salty and pretty much inedible. The final strike was the amount of rice I got on our combos which was essentially a row of rice on the plate the width of two fingers. My finally bill (insult) for two combos was ~$20.

Overall, will never be returning and will not recommend this Chino's to anyone that still had the great experience of the South Chandler Chino's in their memory."}
{"text":"A good quick meal that tastes pretty good as well. I end up usually getting the jerk fried rice, and jade red chicken. Grab the black beans you'll thank me :).

The snicker doodle they give with your meal is delicious as well (love the after meal treat).

The only true downside is you'll be in a food coma by the time you're done with the meal (unless you get the bowl which is about half the amount of food).

Overall, check this place out. It's worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is food that you will never know you wanted before you try it, but you will crave it forever after. The black beans and the jerk fried rice are great compliments to the entrees, all of which that I have tried have been delicious. This is no fancy place, and the decor leaves much to be desired, but there's a reason it's always packed at lunch time. Try the pollo diablo, or the jade red chicken, or even the chile relleno."}
{"text":"I'm now very conflicted with this establishment. 

The original location is SO MUCH BETTER. The employees there take the time out to explain their fusion menu, they give you tastings of entrees, and made me fall in love with Chino Bandido. 

I do, however, work much closer to this location, and I was so excited to make the trek here to emulate that first experience. 

Sadly, every time I come here, I feel like I'm collecting a debt when I'm placing an order with this location's employees. I guess nobody likes working here...
I love their food, as you can see I've checked in here a few times. 

But enough's enough: 
-Finding the place still takes quite a bit of effort at night
-The ambience is awful, the storefront is having an identity crisis while trying to be a hip sports bar with the TVs and San Tan brews, but fails to deliver good food instead
-They're always out of Egg Foo Yung...the one time they had it, it tasted completely bland and nothing like the one I ordered from the original location
-They've gotten my order wrong. When I'm only placing two bowl orders and the place is not remotely busy, there's no excuse

Maybe I need to find the manager/owners and have a heart to heart talk. Either these are two different franchisees or they need to shape up this location"}
{"text":"Typically with this place you know you are going to receive an amazing meal. Unfortunately this time around was different. Something changed about this place. I used to come here when it opened up and have always gotten the same meal.

I always get a combo meal, teriyaki, jade red chicken quesadilla, and chicken friend rice. I have sworn by this meal to people as I think it's one of the best. My recent visit I was let down a lot. 

I walk in, wrote down my usual and look at the cashier and she walks away. I thought she was doing the register because she had just taken a ladies order... Guess not. So I wait... Finally a lady take my order and before I could order she tried to upsell me on some new stuff, so I tried because hey it can't possibly be bad. 

When I received my meal the teriyaki sauce was off it looks like a jello gravy consistency. It's usually a real teriyaki sauce and tastes delicious. I picked up my weapon of choice, my fork, and dive right in. I was shocked by the disgusting flavor and texture I received from the teriyaki chicken. In disbelief I let my friend try some and she was shocked at how gross it was too. So I put the teriyaki aside for the fly that kept flying around. 

I then headed towards the jade red chicken quesadilla. It tasted normal and great but they definitely shorted me on the chicken. Thinking of it as a oh well mentality I headed towards the wings I ordered. Yes that's right they now have wings. When I opened the ranch I originally thought it was blue cheese, I was wrong.  It was homemade ranch that just tasted like sour cream mixed with a pickle. 

The wings I half are was absolutely terrible. I am truly amazed at the route this place I used to love went. Hopefully they get it together because I miss it. There are other things different there like the nice gentlemen playing his guitar trying to hit the rights notes. I thought this was restaurant that was chill. Not a bar. Anyways, I hope this review helps beware anyone that thinks they will get decent food, with a very nice staff. I say that with the most sarcastic voice in my head."}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought that these combinations would work?  The concept was somewhat difficult to initially grasp, but after tasting the food, it works.  If you're a first timer, they help explain how it works and they give you samples to help you choose from their many options.  The jade red chicken and jerk chicken are must haves...they're staples!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. We found this place by chance driving through one day! Who would have thought that a place like this existed. We love the mix of two authentic foods into one! Rice and meat, maybe add some beans or another type of meat. I always get the teriyaki chicken bowl...it's great but get an extra side of teriyaki sauce for it. The portion size leaves me full but not miserably full. It's perfect. The restaurant itself could probably use some upgrades but the area of town it is in can only support casual dining. We love it and will continue to come back! The snicker doodles are the best too! Seriously...how do you make a cookie so fluffy and oh so soft??? Tell me your secret!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously...if you haven't been here stop reading this review and just head over. You can thank me later. Not only do they have the best combinations you never thought of, but you can also sample everything on the menu before ordering. If you don't know what something is, just ask for a sample. 

The ordering takes a little getting used to, but once they walk you through it a few times you'll be an old pro. The red chicken is my favorite and they can guide you on fan favorites also. Bring your appetite because you'll be full when you leave. 

For two people with drinks just a hair over $20.00, sounds like a place for me. The atmosphere is not some swanky place and all the cutlery is plastic, but aren't those the best places anyway? Last but not least one cookie per order to round out your meal...Snicker doodle.  #boom"}
{"text":"This is the greatest place ever!  My friends had told me about it, but I just didnt believe that Chinese Mexican would be good.  I was right, it is FANTASTIC!  Love that Place!  Get  a jade red quesadilla and a hand grenade burrito, and double order of jerk fried rice!  yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place.  For the first timer, they let you sample everything on the menu, then teach you how to properly order.  Based off of the taste test, I knew what I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed the tasty fusion experience.  Great food, hope to get out there and visit it again sometime.  Jade Red Chicken is very tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Great food at good prices and unique menu items"}
{"text":"I loveeee this place my go to here is the 7/11 with white rice and black beans extra teriyaki sauce. nom nom nom.... their cookies are to die for... I buy an extra one... and on fri/sat they have different kinds of cookies."}
{"text":"Found this place doing my research on Yelp for a cool place to grab a meal.  

If you're in the area - GO to this place!  The person helping us was exceptionally helpful.  I walked in, went up to the counter and said I had never been there and what do they recommend.  Jerk chicken and Red chicken were the choices, so I ordered both.  

The chicken was cooked perfectly and spicy (Jerk chicken anyway).  

The rice, beans, every thing was really good.  I will be back.

Found this online about the place:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86kjMk63PLY"}
{"text":"I went to this place with some friends after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives expecting something AMAZING.  While it wasn't awful, it wasn't quite as good as Guy Fieri made it sound. 

I ordered the Carnitas Quesedilla and the Jade Red Chicken combo served with jerk rice and black beans. (Way too much food for one, but I wanted to taste a few different items.) The cuban black beans were by far the best thing on the plate, nicely seasoned and a creamy texture.

I'd recommend not getting the Jade Red Chicken.  Its one of the top sellers but the crispy chicken pieces lose their crispness when dunked in the sauce and the flavor is mild when combined with the jerk rice and cuban black beans.  If you like sweet and mild, slightly soggy fried chicken pieces, then its for you. 

If I went back I'd probably stick with the carnitas or other non-fried food."}
{"text":"I love the jade red chicken and chicken fried rice! I usually order extra sauce and they deliver.  :) The emerald chicken in a quesadilla is also very good."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. Jade red chicken with jerk fried rice is spectacular! 
The watermelon tea!  heaven. 

Staff is ALWAYS courteous and friendly! 


The dining room could've been a little cleaner on my last visit, but truth be told they were BUSY!!!
Also the watermelon tea was fermented, first time I've ever experienced that."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great meat options. A few veggie,  nothing vegan. Hot the spot with great taste and value after a long day hiking. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Tried fusion food for the first and had to change all the misconceptions about fusion food. Jade chicken and jerk chicken are awesome. Totally loved every we had."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've gone my whole life never eating this place! It's so good. I don't even know how to describe it, besides being great food. The food sounds like it may not go well together, but it definitely does!"}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good. I would prefer other places to eat, but still good. It is definitely not my top choice."}
{"text":"In Short :
A SUPER HIT fusion of Mexican n Asian.
Quick preparation, Flexible Item selection and humble service.

Details :
Been here so many times during my stay in '12-'13.
Can't resist their Jade-Red Chicken Combo.!! I've tried all other Chicken varieties. Diablo is the spiciest (It hits you a few minutes after you finish eating).
The beans will be topped with Cheese unless if you say no. ;) The fried rice is not the best but sure is tasty. 
THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL IS THEIR FREEEE SNICKER DOODLE COOKIE. (Sometimes they run out of the cookies...Just Stay CALM, leave and comeback the next day.)
They sell them on Weekends if you want more.

Cons:
Zero points for Ambiance. It's like a FF joint. Pay, wait and eat. So be sure who you go with. :)
Not so clean and not so well maintained tables etc. But heyyy who cares when the food is so crazy awesome.!!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Chino Bandido several years ago at the Chandler location and I remember liking the concept. I was hiking around this area and found this Chino Bandido. You wouldn't come for the decor, atmosphere or even the service, but you come for the inexpensive food. You can make your own combo such as a jade red chicken burrito or quesadilla with your choice of beans and fried rice. This time I ordered jade red chicken with a chili relleno and black beans with jerk chicken fried rice. The portions are generous but the chicken lacked flavor. The chili relleno was spicy, a little too spicy to me. My party enjoyed the food and for 3 entrees, we spent around $30 that fed 4 people. Not bad."}
{"text":"The reviews are true! My wife Julie and I drove out here from Surprise (37mi) just to try this place. Disappointed we were not! It's self order and although I didn't get the lady's name(pretty sure she was the owner or something) behind the counter she took the time to explain what was what. Even so much as providing us samples of everything to eliminate surprises. 
We each ordered the 2 entree with a side, that they do bring out to your table. The dining room is pretty big. Much to our surprise they had NASCAR showing on there one tv. This made it that much more enjoyable since we are fans. 
Domestic bottled beer is $3, which I thought was a little steep. So I just had 1 & Julie ordered a fountain drink.
After they bring the food out they don't come back to check on you and all the condiments and everything is self serve. Which works out even better for me, cause I didn't have to leave a tip! Leaving the total visit to $24..... Very Nice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved the food, so many different combinations awesome and the ordering process was made easy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, could not be happier with the unique taste and quick service. The staff is unbelievably nice and helpful. 
The seating area is a bit different, given how amazing their food is and how busy they are all the time I think they deserve a better seating area but the food is worth every part of it and makes it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"In short, amazing!

In long, this place has an awesome selection and mix of food.  I love that the location is somewhat tucked away.  Although I wish this restaurant all the success in the world, I love the low-key feel of the place.  The staff is super nice and accommodating.

They offer samples so if someone has never been here, they'll be able to sample their many selections before diving into something that they might not particularly enjoy.

I appreciate the option to eat with chopsticks.  They also have some spice that I have no idea what it is but it's widely available by the soda fountain and is quite tasty.

Saving the best thing about this restaurant for last, they GIVE Snicker Doodle cookies with your meal!!!"}
{"text":"Chino is one of those secret places that is anything but a secret.  It has been featured on the Food Network Diners, Dives, and Drive-ins and for good reason.

Picture this scene-I am moving from Tulsa to Phoenix for a new Job. My future boss wants me to meet him at some run down shopping center for lunch before I even start work. I am in town to look at houses in 2005 (yes I got screwed and paid way too much).  So I roll up to this place and think I made a mistake, but after having a lunch there I was and am hooked on Chino for life. I now live in San Diego but when I go back to see my upside down house I must stop in at Chino. You should too...well not the house part. 

The place has the best most unique food of anywhere I have been. Asian-mexican fusion?  I guess maybe, but fusion connotes some sense of sophistication. Chino is fantabulous but for goodness sake, dinner is served in an aluminum freaking bowl. Sophisticated it is not. The tables are reminiscent of a bingo hall, long with crappy chairs. In a location like this, the food has to be good or they will end up like the other tenants around them-here today and gone tomorrow. 

Now the food-fantastic!  Jade Red chicken is their most popular. Think sweet-n-sour but with a spiced red sauce and not nearly as tough to chew.  It will be mixed with some brand of rice you choose on the menu, such as chicken fried, jerk fried, white, etc. 

My favorite is the Emerald Chicken, made up of tender chicken slices with a fantastic green sauce made of Ginger, garlic, oil, and other mysterious but yummy ingredients. 

You pick your meal from an order card you grab inside the door. Take a red pen and circle the stuff you want.  Yep kinda weird but they can help sort you out at the counter if you need it. There is a wall with photos of each meal but it appears to have been taken in 1963, then placed in the Phoenix sun for a few years. Forget it. Just ask or look around. They do have samples which help. 

Oh to make it more confusing there is a secret menu of sorts too such as the 7-11. I don't even know what it is but my buddy digs it the most. 

The grub is great and they finish nicely with a phenomenal fatty sugar cookie. No one, and I mean no one says anything bad about the cookie. 

Go try this place. It is worthy of 6 stars."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. We were looking for places to eat that were on DDD and this one did not disappoint. Asian and Mexican fusion? Somehow it works. The place was in a strip mall so we knew it was gonna be good. The even hand out samples at the front and suggested the Jade chicken and carnitas quesadillas. It was so good. We all cleaned our plates and were totally satisfied and incredibly impressed. Not much in the way of service except up front but my guess is they expect most folks to take it to go. Either way, it was all delicious. Would definitely suggest a stop in here despite the exterior."}
{"text":"I've been here twice...disappointed both times. I came here a second time because of all the good reviews, thinking maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but second time, didn't like my food again.

The food is of poor quality and seasoning isn't all that great. Very ghetto."}
{"text":"I've been sitting on this one for awhile.  I have to say that I believe that Chino Bandido is a love/hate kind of place.  You don't just feel okay about it, ever- you either love it or hate it.

I'm on the naysayer's side.  I wasn't impressed, in the least.  I thought the chicken was a bit gnarly and for the amount of calories you are consuming, it just isn't worth it.

There are some positives- free samples to ensure that you like what you are ordering, actual spiciness and divey feel.  

I realize that this is a Phoenix favorite, but I'm going to have to say, try it once and decide which side of the fence you're on.  I'm glad that I'm on the 'hate' side because it isn't anywhere near healthy."}
{"text":"Good God, this place was really, really bad.  Not bad in a good way, not greasy but delicious bad, but really, really amazingly bad.  I had read online these amazing reviews about the Chino, so there I was today, an internet lemming heading up to Moon Valley to try it out.  I shop at Wal-Mart on Thomas, so I'm used to scary looking people.  Man, there was no preparing me for this place.  Bubba and his prison pals were hanging out watching a super loud TV in the dining room, shoveling food in their mouths and yelling at their kids running around the joint in between bites of greasy food.
I have to admit, watching it made me 1., wish birth control was more readily available to some people, but also 2., look forward to the sloppy congealed mess that was slapped in tinfoil plates.  I appreciate sloppy and greasy food.  Hell, I grew up on the stuff.  
Maybe it wasn't a good sign that, after paying over $10 for what looked like a tv dinner accompanied by a styrofoam soda, an employee of the Chino was smacking insects with a fly swatter on the table next to mine.  But I decided that if it was good enough to be one of the top rated restaurants in Phoenix, it was good enough for me.
I could not have been more wrong.  I ordered the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice & refried beans.  The reviews I read said this was the best food north of Guadalajara and west of Shanghai.  
I took a bite of everything on my plate, one different serving at a time...and it was disgusting!  This \"food\" made me think that my little brother got stoned, threw some four-day old take-out Chinese food in the microwave, threw a ton of pepper all over it and topped it off with Frito-Lay bean dip.
So at this point, I'm feeling ripped off.  Over ten bucks for this slop?  I threw it all away and felt defeated.  Never before had I ever let a meal get the best of me.  And I've eaten British food, so I can tell you what crap tastes like.
I took my cookie and walked out, driving up to Bell Road to McDonalds, vowing never to eat at any restaurant that that douchebag Guy Fieri has ever visited."}
{"text":"Location: Horrible location, but worth going there for the food.

Food: I think I've tried it all. Everything I've had there is amazing and worth trying.

Cleanliness: This is where I dock them a star. I've ate inside a few times, but it is pretty dirty.

Overall: Great people watching. You will see people show up in expensive cars, followed by construction workers. It is nice seeing all the people enjoying their food.

Note:
Get the black beans!"}
{"text":"Amazing.

If you can't imagine what Mexican-Asian fusion would taste like, Chino's is a must-see. There is nothing like it and the food is outstanding. 
I never thought soy sauce would be good on refried beans either.

I recommend the Jen Red Chicken and the Chinese BBQ Pork.
Hengrenade Chicken is good too if you like the flavor of Jerk but not all the pepper."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this neighborhood joint.  After reading the good reviews, decided to give it a try.  We looked over the menu for some time.  The staff asked if it was our first time.  Yes it was and he gave us a few samples to help the decision making.  I liked the taste of their emerald chicken.  It reminded me of a Chinese steamed chicken with tasty sauce.  Hubby ordered Jade chicken and jerk chicken.  He said both were good except the jerk chicken was neither Mexican nor Asian and very spicy.    Extra bonus for the large free Snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookie with the meal. Good value for the $ and they bring your food to the table."}
{"text":"To say that I love Chino Bandino is an understatement lol Chino is my favorite restaurant in Arizona and it's soooo dangerous that they are literally 5 minutes from my house! Ive tried everything on the menu and my go to is the combo meal with the hengrenade and diablo chicken (this is very spicy!) with jerk fried rice! With the combo, you can also make one of your meats into a burrito or quesadilla! Their Cuban black beans are amazing too but I always just get the jerk rice because it's my favorite thing on the menu and they always short you rice when you order beans lol. Everyone else I know always gets the Jade Red chicken, it's the most popular item on the menu. Anyways, if you've never had Chino, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"you won't find another place like this. I love it and it never lets me down.  I have taken tons of people here and they all enjoy it too.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I think I just died and went to Chinese food heaven...or maybe it's Mexican food heaven...nope, it's snicker doodle cookie heaven. Not one complaint about Chino Bandido, great service and amazing food. The chile rellano is like nothing I've eaten before, whatever the coating they use, I want to bathe in it. I'm really not one for fried or extra cheese, but that is exactly what it is and I would eat it again and again and probably again. The only difficulty here: getting up to leave, now that is one full stomach."}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews here....nodding my head and going \"AWWW YEAHHH!\" when I see 4 and 5 star reviews....just shaking my head, confused, and kinda angry at some of of the 1-3 star ones....like, what's wrong with your taste buds, people? 

Best place in Phoenix to eat casually. Hands down.

My current order I'm obsessed with: Jade Red Chicken (which is like the Orange Chicken at Panda, as in you need to have this in EVERY combo plate you eat here, it's a prerequisite), a Jerk Chicken burrito with cheese and sour cream added, Pork fried rice, and black beans. (Always- ALWAYS get the black beans....like protein chocolate pudding).

Also- their snickerdoodle, when fresh, is the BEST COOKIE IN THE WORLD.

Haven't been to the one in Chandler, reading the Yelp reviews, I get the vibe it's not as good as the Phoenix one...but even if it's only HALF as good, it'll still be amazing.

If you're not making at least a monthly voyage here, no matter where you may live in the valley, what are you doing with your life?"}
{"text":"Place is legit, I was introduced by a friend at work. I tried the orange chicken quesadilla bomb. I've had it 4x keep it up and keep it orfinslly price is fair for what you get."}
{"text":"Chino is delish !!!!  It the type of comfort food you get when you don't know what exactly you want and it satisfies that dark place in your food soul you can't express but know when you nom chino it is a happy place!!"}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago, we love the Emerald chicken and Jade Red chicken. It wasn't too busy when we arrived, maybe around 130pm. The staff are nice."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chino for at least 20 years (pre-Guy Fieri).  I've always loved it for what it is....quirky combos of fun food. Gourmet? No, but good and I always look forward to a chance to Chino. Now i have kids I've passed that on to them...they love to Chino as well.  Food has pretty much remained the same over the years which is good. What has changed at least recently is the execution of service.  I live much farther away from Chino than in the old days...20+ miles. So when I bring the family to Chino's or bring carryout home, it is kind of a special occasion. Last time...brought the family plus my mom in, they screwed up our order and were out of Snickerdoodles. Granted, they quickly fixed the order and promised us double snickerdoodles next time. Ok...crap happens.  Let it slide.  Tonight I went in..wrote my take out order (3 rice bowls 2 combos 50-something bucks) mentioned they owed me double cookies and the guy said no problem.  Order came out pretty quickly for a Friday night so I took it and drove the 20+ miles home.  They neatly package takeout orders with the bag folded and tucked so it isn't practical to check your order in the restaurant.  Unfortunately when I got home my son's rice bowl was missing.  Called Chinos to tell them they (again) screwed up my order but this time I'm a half hour away. Again the guy on the phone was cool and said he'd give me two combos for free next time even though it was a rice bowl missing.  I appreciate the attempt at service recovery.  However fact is Chino is in an 0 for 2 slump.  Place is a favorite of mine from the way back. But if service doesn't improve next time....no more Takee  Outee forevermore.  Place will still have patrons lined up to the door so they won't miss me I guess."}
{"text":"The food was great! They have a pretty unique way of ordering by having you pick each food item in your combo by checking boxes. I had the Pollo Diablo, Emerald Chicken, and the Jerk Chicken. All were amazing! I gave this place one less star because the portions were less than generous and the place is pretty divey."}
{"text":"This place is so bad I made a yelp account just to tell you all how poor it is. I loved this place when it was in Chandler, but this Phoenix location is a dump. Not a \"dive\" just a dump. The food was half cold, half scalding hot like it was in a broken microwave. The location is terrible with a poorly maintained dining area.  Everything that was good about the chandler location is terrible about the phoenix location, and they are equally distant from my house. It was a 30min out to chandler that I would be excited for, but the 30min drive to phoenix location was such a terrible experience I will never return. Terrible. Just terrible."}
{"text":"So Mexican-Asian fusion sounds disgusting. 
The first time I ever tried it, in fact, I hated it, yet a week later, I couldn't stop craving it. A fair warning was given by my friend, Sean M. that I wouldn't be able to resist it.

Teriyaki Chicken Quesadilla... YOU SHOULD NOT WORK.. but somehow, you are one of the best tasting creations known to man. Chino Bandido, you are so good.... you are so good that I am WILLING to eat there even though I know 45 minute to an hour later my stomach will be growling as loud as a mountain lion. 

The service is speedy, I like that you write your order on an order sheet and hand it to the cashier where you immediately pay for your food and then you take your seat. They come out a few minutes later calling your name so that you can receive your aluminum tray full of deliciousness. 

I really dislike your snickerdoodles. Blech. 
However, I can definitely see why Guy Fieri loves you so much, Chino Bandido."}
{"text":"definitely love the food here. I've only been here twice, but each time the food has been wonderful and the service fast and friendly. 
I would recommend the machaca, carnitas and jen red quesadilla (sweet and sour).

I do like how the food comes in a tinfoil container, so if I want to get my food to go all I need is a lid and it's ready for carry out. 

My one complaint is there is no ice tea. They do have Lipton tea from the fountain, but that's not tea, I don't know what that swill is. If only they would get some fresh brewed tea, this place would get five stars."}
{"text":"This was all sorts of yum!!! Hubby and I came in for the first time ever during his lunch break. I had the red jade chicken, he had a bean burrito and our son had a quesadilla. I just want to go back and try a different combo. The restaurant was super packed but it's a day off for pretty much everyone so it's expected. We had to take our good to go because the hubby had to go back to work, but we're definitely making the drive back when we have more time."}
{"text":"My fiance had been begging me to go to Chino Bandido with him.  So, last weekend, I  finally caved.  It's a Mexican-Asian Fusion restaurant.  I had the Jade Red Chicken, which was really good, accompanied with just some plain, steamed white rice.  He had the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla with the Machaca and Jerk Fried rice.  He loved everything on his plate.  Overall, I'd say the restaurant was what I expected.  I'll probably get take-out next time though.  The seating is cafeteria-style, and the tables and floors weren't clean.  :/  That was kind of a bummer.  The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable though.  It's worth your time to check it out. =)"}
{"text":"This is truly a hole in the wall. I dragged my family here and was nervous when we walked in and saw the layout. The food, however was well received. 

The menu is a little overwhelming but they are really helpful in explaining how to order. They have a choice of two proteins and you can make both, either or night into a quesadilla or burrito.  I love that you can have both Mexican and Chinese food on the same plate!  I wasn't sure how they would taste next to one another but somehow, it works. 

To top it off, they give a snickerdoodle cookie with the meals!  All the food is served in to go tins so whatever you don't finish, you can just bring home. There is a lot of food so it is most likely that many people would bring home leftovers! 

Not a fancy place but fun and a unique  place to try!"}
{"text":"I still can't get over this whole Chinese Mexican whachamacallit concept. 

Granted, the story of a couple combining their cultural backgrounds is lovely, but I cannot wholeheartedly accept this combination of cuisines.

First timers are given a taste tour of couple items. Little sample cups of their meats and rice. Out of their 14 main items, they include things like: carnitas, Chinese bbq pork, egg foo young, jade red chicken (sweet&sour), jen red pork (sweet&sour), emerald chicken (ginger&onion), etc. The menu: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=BMDFYI4Hl-Vw7rsjvzbhVQ)

For those who are unaware, I am not a big fan of Chinese food. So imagine my dismay after realizing my options. And coming from the Bay Area where Chinese food is readily available and at higher standards, I did not travel all this way to have Chinese food, let alone...fusion Chinese food. But my friends were eager to try this, and so there I was.

Food can be ordered in the following options:
1) Rice bowl: Choice of a main item and steamed rice (too Chinese for me. Pass!)
2) Combo: Choice of two main items with steamed rice (even more Chinese. Pass!)
3) Quesadilla: Choice of a main item with cheese (had quesadilla already. Pass!)
4) Burrito: Choice of a main item in tortilla (my only option)

Jerk Chicken with Cuban Black Bean Burrito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=eap6hGNvq6Afm-xjso-nAA): The thought of putting sweet and sour pork or egg foo young in a burrito frightened me. So I opted for the safer choices. The jerk chicken was marinated with really hot peppers, which I did not know beforehand. And the black beans were also spicy. My mouth was on fire!!!! The burrito was $3.50. Added black beans and cheese. Plus a fountain drink, my total came to $8! The burrito was tiny! What the heck did I pay for?! Tastewise, the burrito was dry. And their choice of 'hot sauces' were a homemade black bean sauce or some sweet tangy egg roll dipping sauce. Bleh.

Each order came with a cookie (Snickerdoodle or Volcano) which was a nice touch. But how does a cookie tie into Chinese or Mexican cuisine?

One of the most confusing dining experiences ever. Oh yeah, it was another Guy Fieri DDD spot.

This Chino did not likeO."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will definitely be back. 
The food was amazing and affordable and the kids even loved it.
The only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is because it was pretty dirty in the seating area. I guess you should expect that to be the case at a restaurant in a strip mall but since it was so hyped up I had higher expectations in that area."}
{"text":"Who would have thought this mixture of foods would be so absolutely awesome and tasty? I went here because it was featured on DDD one night...and boy, it was gooooooood as it looked! The food had a little kick to it. Oh, and it's awesome also because they give you a snickerdoodle cookie for dessert. I will be back. Thanks, Guy!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good definitely a different kind of pairing. I never would've thought of pairing Chinese food with Mexican but it's actually very good! Jade chicken is my favorite, along with their black beans they have a great spice!"}
{"text":"This place is so great and original. I've been going for years I can still spot new people trying chinos! The emerald chicken in a quesadilla is life! I have never left disappointed. Even the cookie is bomb. The salsa is like no other, the proof is than before u could grab as much as u want, now I have to ask for it!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for years and that is before the whole term \"fusion\" was common.  Great food all the time, everytime"}
{"text":"Had the Bandido tonight via take out and it was fantastic!  That much flavor in one glorious round container is almost too much joy.   Love love love love love their food, every item I try is good.  The black beans probably have magical powers.  I had gone to bed, left just a couple of spoonfuls for the next day, but only made it an hour in bed before having to get up and finish the beans.  Yes, they are that good.  And now I find out you can also order a small salad to balance the carbs?  If they had delivery, I would not be able to contain myself."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on diner drive in and dives. It was just okay. Average Mexican and Asian food mixed together. You can get taco with chow Mien or enchiladas with fried rice etc. hot sauce is not hot!"}
{"text":"Love the food! People have always been friendly and service great. Can't wait to bring my family there when they visit. I highly recommend the jade red chicken. It's one of the popular choices for a reason."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chino Bandidos for years now. Have my order down. (7Q/7B- blk beans - jfr) So when I go and pick up food for me and the hubby I get my slip write my order and up to the counter with in minutes. Never change our selection because we love it. We always get food to go. We even go out of our way every so often, as we are on the opposite side of town. My husband usually eats his in one sitting and for me it's like 2-3 meals if I share with the hubby or not. Before today I would give them 5 stars. 

It's been a few months since we have gotten food from here but I was in the area and decided to get some. I order the usual. Drive an hour to get home and I'm excited to dive in.  it wasn't jade red chicken (#7) my usual. So disappointing. And on top of it the jerk fried rice was greasy and didn't have the usual kick to it. 

I usually don't write reviews but so disappointed in the over an hour anticipation of having the regs only to be rejected . I gave them a 4 stars because this has been the first bad experience I have had and I'm hoping this was just a one time thing. I'm willing to keep hope but if this is going to be the new pattern I won't be going out of my way anymore."}
{"text":"Red jade chicken and the jerk chicken are to die. Splurge on the extra 85 cents and get the jerk fried rice. They give you a snickerdoodle cookie too! Drinks are sold separately which is fine.  The service here is efficient. You order, yes you can sample the meats. You pay and you sit down. Someone brings your food out to you. The place isn't fancy it's pretty much take out but they have a huge seating area. Bring the kids ... it's super casual and super chill. There is a TV it plays sports there is a huge parking lot. There are bathrooms. No they aren't gender neutral. You might have to wipe your own table down.. deal with it  the food is amazing the people are nice. Be nice to them as well. They are the ones making your food and they make it pretty damn well."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers.

What we ate:
1. machaca burrito-according to my son this was one of the best burritos he has had in a while..it was $3.50 and he ate it in like 4 bites..a bit small.

2. Jade red pork quesadilla, jerk chicken, white rice- the rice was fine, the quesadilla only had a few pieces of pork and the chunks were huge and very very dry and tough. That jerk chicken was the most awful thing I have ever tasted !!!! that was not jerk chicken...it was soaked, dredged in nothing but black pepper, I almost choked. Jerk should be spicy and I am a fan of the spice, this was not edible in any way.

3. carnitas burrito, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice-the chicken was average, tasted like sweet and sour chicken, the jerk fried rice was almost as overpowering as the chicken, but edible. the carnitas was like no other we have ever seen...shredded beyond belief and a weird spinach flavor to it. we asked if spinach was in it and was told it was cilantro. The cilantro may have taken on a bitter flavor from being cooked for so long...whatever the case ...the flavor was just odd and had a horrible after taste for hours.

The staff were very nice and accomadating. 
i dont think i will venture here again...ever."}
{"text":"I was curious about this place after hearing about it. They have some very interesting combinations that I'll have to admit were very tasty. I thought the food was above average, but you really don't get very much for the money. I really thought that I was going to have to eat again in a few hours. Place is huge and feels like a dining hall.
The person taking our order was very friendly and offered us tastes of anything we wanted to try."}
{"text":"Food was obviously old. not fresh at all. Jade red was not cooked properly. the emerald chicken barely had any emerald sauce. the rice was undercooked, the beans were rancid. as in they were improperly stored/reheated. gross gross gross. as for the employees.... unhelpful, lazy, and angry"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years! You literally can do no wrong. The jade red chicken is their signature item and with good reason. It's sweet and spicy and way better than anything that fits this description that you could get from a place like panda. Make sure to go on a Saturday to get their volcano cookies! Although other types of cookies are also amazing. I seriously try to bring everyone I know here and once you try it you will want to too."}
{"text":"A decent fusion concept. I love the atmosphere, I really enjoyed my jade red chicken, jerk rice, and especially my pollo diablo. The staff is very helpful and even offers samples for first timers like myself. If you haven't been here before, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Just an incredible combination of mexican and asian food and flavors. I'll admit I really wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. But I'm so glad I tried it.

If it's you're first time, tell 'em and they'll give you several samples and explain the menu.  I loved the black beans with just a little spice.  Then I had ginger chicken and the jerk chicken.  Oh so good.  The chicken was moist and not fatty.  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were just fantastic.

Yes the inside is a bit rough, but not dirty.  Clearly people come for the food and friendly service.  I'd have been perfectly content sitting any where as long as I got to eat the food.

Then to top it off you get a free snickerdoodle cookie...yum. I left completely stuffed, but didn't regret a single bite. In fact I want to go back again to try more tomorrow before I fly out."}
{"text":"Way too much hype for me....my expectations were way higher than what I got.  Unique?  Yes.  For me?  not so much..."}
{"text":"Mexican & Chinese sounds like a wired combo but you will be surprised that it actually works well. This place is great. The menu is a little confusing at first but the staff is eager to help. They have the best Jerk Chicken & Jerk Fried rice. If you like your food spicy you should definitely try their Jerk Chicken. They really have a good selection of stuff to order."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix almost a year ago and have heard since I moved here about the great Chino Bandido. I was really excited to try it and after much anticipation went there tonight. I arrived at 8 pm with some friends and thought it was weird that all of the chairs were flipped up on the tables except for a few vacant tables and it was still an hour til closing time. 

I ordered my food and got it quickly (there were only a few other people there) and noticed my beans were cold and somehow burnt at the same time. The rest of my food was okay but definitely fell short of expectations. 

However none of that compared to what happened next. At around 8:15, two of the young employees started mopping the whole place starting right at the drink machine. I had never in my life seen such obvious disregard for customers. Once again, there was still 45 minutes left until closing time.  When one customer tried to get to the drink machine they did not move or even apologize for mopping. 

I also noticed that there was no wet surface sign. So not only was the mopping incredibly rude but also incredibly unsafe. When I asked one of the employees mopping if she had a wet surface sign to put out, she apologized and thanked me for reminding her while saying someone else usually does it. After I explained why the situation was unsafe and our conversation ended I assumed she would get a sign but instead went right back to mopping and later stood around talking to other employees. 

I certainly can't blame a couple of 16 year olds who are probably working their first job, but I can blame management which were no where to be found. I would normally not post a negative review but this was single handedly the worst restaurant experience of my life. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Food Network I called my Bro. who lives in Chandler and asked him if he has been here, and of course his answer was yes, so I told him next time I'm in town I want to hit up this place so it was a done deal, the food was just okay I liked what I ordered but it wasn't really a wow factor for me, my Mom on the other hand didn't care for the food at all so she wont be returning. It's cool that you get to sample the food before you order it that way you know whats good and what's not..."}
{"text":"I moved from the west valley to the FAR east valley about a year ago. This would have been a sad, sad time for me... saying goodbye to the west valley Chino that I have grown to love and adore. But after I tried this location, I knew life would go on.
   Everything I eat here, I love. This place is just awesome and fun and you must try the jerk fried rice!"}
{"text":"Interesting blend of food.  It was good, but I can't say that I would ever crave this place."}
{"text":"Wow, I did not expect this place to be this good.  The food was quickly prepared and everything was excellent(that we have tried so far.). Not a bean guy, so I can't say anything about them.  Service is friendly and willing to help.  Food says it's spicy, but honestly nothing to worry about if you enjoy Thai chilies.  I only wished they had their nutritional information written so I can keep track of myself, but the food is too good.  I'll try to work around it.  Highly recommend the chile relleno, machaca and the pollo Diablo.  If you are nearby, don't hesitate to give the place a try."}
{"text":"Wow. I had their chile relleno and black beans. Relleno was one of the best ever. Cooked so it resembled a corn dog. It was full of rich cheese and crunchy. The black beans were creamy and delicious. Dishes others had were also very good. They give samples before you order if you want."}
{"text":"Always a great experience coming to this restaurant. Food is prepared quickly and served directly to your table. I love the mix of Chinese and Mexican food. Chino Bandido is original in that aspect as i have never seen another restaurant that serves a blend of the two. The restaurant is always kept clean and staff are friendly to help in any way. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Well, I was hopeful that the food would be great. Ordered egg foo young and chili rellano with rice. The egg was dry and tasteless and the chili rellano was over-breaded. Although the chili was good, cheese was almost non-existent. The little that was there tasted like velveeto. The rice was uneatable. Tossed most of the meal. Very, very disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Interesting food combinations delicious flavors fast friendly service and a great price! All you need to know!"}
{"text":"Interesting mix of mexican and chinese,  one of the first places that I tried in AZ. Great service as well. Try to sample all their food before ordering."}
{"text":"Got to check off another Triple D off my list. Hole in the wall place in phoenix. You would never know this place even exisited. The places was packed for a Saturday. But the wait for food was short. The woman taking our orders was great. She went over the menu throughly and went over the most popular items. Very sweet lady! 
The menu has an eclectic mix of flavors. Mexican, Chinese, and carribean. 
The combo platters are reasonably priced with good sized portions.
I had the jerk fried rice with chicken, red chicken, black beans and chile relleno.
The red chicken was fried a little too much, so it was dry and not hot when served. The rice was so fluffy with tons of jerk seasoning. The black beans were so creamy but lots of flavor.
The chile relleno was the best! Sooo much gooey cheese and fried perfectly. It stayed crispy the whole time. 
Quesadilla was full of cheese and had nice crispy edges. The chicken teriyaki was tender and teriyaki sauce was thick and sweet.
We also received complimentary snickerdoodle cookies. Those were fresh soft and full of cinnamon!"}
{"text":"While I appreciate the unique concept, I haven't found a menu item that I like enough to overcome the divey feel (dirty plastic folding tables) and lines. For those that like it -  more power to you! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Fusion. 

When we saw this place on Drive-ins, Diners & Dives with Guy Fieri I thought WTH? But we had to try it and it was absolutely incredible. 

We arrived just before opening and there were like 6 cars with people waiting, as soon as they opened everyone went it. We went last, of the early arrivers. When it was our turn we told the girl at the counter that it was our first time there and didn't know what to get, so she started handing us samples of like 1/3 of the menu. 

The Jerk Fried Rice is interesting and works really well. We thoroughly enjoyed the Macheca and the Red Jade Chicken both as Quesadillas. They were nothing like anything I have ever experienced, in a good way, of course. The portions are large enough to share and be satisfied.

Chino Bandido will definitely be a stop we make when we travel to or through Phoenix, it's only about 10 miles north of Interstate 10."}
{"text":"There are a million reviews for this place and most of them say the same thing...so I'm going to take the easy way out...this place rocks plain and simple. I had the Jade Chicken with Jerk Fried (Chicken) Rice. It was \"sick\" (that's slang for really amazing). I did the \"menu demo\" when I first tried out this place and was impressed. I liked the idea also. You don't see places doing that anymore. It reminded me of the true selling power of the sample...and damn good samples too! And it's super cheap for what you get. It ain't no PF Expensive's. I'm not even a huge snicker doodle cookie fan (chocolate chip is where it's at, folks) but the bonus cookie with your meal is just another fabulous concept and reward for eating at this great place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I am SO upset that they closed down this location for good. Please come back! Phoenix is great and all, but all of us in the East Valley need you back. So please find a better location and re-open. I'm fairly certain that the bizarre location was what did it for them. 

At any rate, if you visit the Chinos that IS open, here is what you should order:

Emerald Chicken Quesadilla
Jade Red Chicken
Jerk Fried Rice
Refried Beans

You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Friendly employees. Good customer service. Order has always been exactly what I asked for. Snicker doodle cookies are so delicious and i love the jade red chicken."}
{"text":"When you buy the combo, you are really buying 2 meals.  Thats probably the best part about this place.  $10 for 2 meals.  
My recommendations:  Jerk Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Chicken Quesadilla with a Chile Relleno burrito.  You wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"The best food in Phoenix. I am absolutely OBSESSED! Recommend this to everyone! 

I recommend Jaded red chicken and Jerk fried rice. Jaded red chicken in a quesadilla is also amazing."}
{"text":"I specifically asked the guy at the counter if the chicken was white meat and he said yes, they use chicken breast. So I ordered the chicken Diablo and it was gross. The chicken was not only dark meat but grizzly, etc.  They have a sign at the counter that says they'll give you free chips and salsa for a positive review. Now I know why there were so many positive reviews because it wasn't very good. However, the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while (yes bc of ddd) and I'm glad I did! I loved it!! I practically inhaled the jerk rice, black beans, jerk chicken and emerald chicken in a quesadilla! to top it off the snickerdoodle is the best!! I will definitely be back! I bring every out of town guest the 40 minute drive (please consider reopening another chandler location, maybe in an easier to find, less smelly location) and every single person loves it. I pretty much went once a week when pregnant.. and then whenever I'm hungover haha"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here. It was exactly as I expected. Hole in the wall good food. Those are my favorite places. It wasn't dirty but it wasn't spotless, it was hole in the wall clean. 
I loved how I got to sample everything. So many different tastes to try.  I loved the food. And I loved the cookie. My meal was perfect. I got the chicken that all the reviews rave about. It is like orange chicken with less sweet orange taste and more savory. Soo good. My husband enjoyed his chicken dish  with cilantro but he was wishing he had mine. I gave him a piece but that was all he was getting from me.  

It was packed on a Sunday night with a diverse crowd with the desire for good food as the common ground. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place before it was featured on the Food Network's show, I just never realized that it was only a few miles away from my place. Had the opportunity to try last night. We walked in and the staff was very friendly. They seemed to realize our confusion over where to sit and how to order. An employee gave us samples of about six different menu items. All were tasty. The refried black beans were not spicy at all. I ordered the jerk chicken in a quesadilla, the jade red chicken and jerk fried rice. Each was delicious! Along w/ a drink and volcano cookie (which is more like a brownie/cookie), the dinner cost about $10 per person. Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  I can't believe it took me this long to come to this place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I could go here any time, any day. I love this place and have been multiple times. Many times while going to school at AiPx. They have quick service and hot food! I love the jade red chicken. I don't even like beans and still, theirs tastes magical! Top it off with a free tasty snickerdoodle and I'd be baffled if you DIDN'T love it. I really never get any of the Mexican dishes, not sure why, but I've scavenged stuff off my friend's plates and of course, it tastes just as good. Quick service, cheap price, tasty food. Go here if you haven't. Right now. GO!"}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life and die happy. 
Was on Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins for a reason.

This is a hole in the wall location, but the food will blow your mind. JADE RED CHICKEN QUESADILLA. So good. My first time going there, the cashier wasn't too busy and helped me by recommendations and letting me sample different types. Plus free cookies with your meal? The snickerdoodles might be better than my mom's. I live 2000+ miles away now and whenever I go back home to visit, this is ALWAYS a stop for me. Doesn't get much better than this. 

For you AZ natives who are scared to give it a try, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Super relaxed open dining space. Bathrooms were clean which is a plus! Got the teriyaki chicken with white rice and it was amazing! The wait was not to long and the service guys were pleasant. Will be coming back to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"I did not care at all, for anything on their menu. Except the Snicker Doodle Cookies. Yuck to everything else."}
{"text":"I always enjoy chinos.  We bring out of Towner's here because it is, IMHO, a Phoenix jewel.  Love the Chinese, Mexican, Jamaican infusion.  Specifically, the jade red chicken, with veggie quesadillas.  Sometimes the tables and bathrooms are not clean enough to my standards. I generally just get soap on some paper napkins and wash the table myself.  It gets crazy busy there so justifying asking a member of staff to clean it just seems petty when I've found a solution that works for me.  For this reason alone I couldn't give them a five star rating."}
{"text":"There isn't a Moon Valley child who's knees don't go weak at the mention of \"Jade Red\" or \"Snickerdoodle.\"

Chino Bandido Takee-Outee is the taste of my youth, the one redeeming restaurant in the entire Moon Valley area and surrounding. Family favorites are the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, and Pollo Diablo. A buddy of mine who worked here in high school turned me on to the Jade Red Chicken and black bean burrito. Wow. It is an ethnic flavor explosion. 

Don't be afraid of the ordering process, they are there to help you through it the first time (and they let you try the most popular dishes!). After that, it's a cinch. The price is right, too, but it really is a hole in the wall. Don't fight it, embrace the dive-y nature.

My only complaint: When I stopped eating meat, I stopped coming to Chino; if you're not carnivorous, the options are pretty limited (the chile relleno is much too greasy for me, the veggie enchilada is a bit al dente). I ache, literally, for that jade red sauce. O, Great Panda, can't you please put it on some vegetables? Tofu? Anything? I was with you long before Guy Fieri."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group after a tech conference as my first time. The picture menu helps you decide what to eat, but the free taste test helps even more. I went with the Red Jade Chicken, which was like a sweet-and-sour chicken. It was pretty good... I wouldn't say that it's any better than Panda Express though. The meal came with a cookie (ftw). 

I'd go back if someone else was driving. It's not close to my house and it didn't have that \"amazing\"  feel that would make me drive to have it. 

They have beer though... bonus."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! My family has been eating here for 12 years and the quality has remained consistent through the years! The staff is always friendly and helpful, offering samples of anything we'd like to try. I love getting a machaca beef quesadilla, it never disappoints!  The inside seating of plastic folding tables and chairs may look shabby to some, but it is always clean and family friendly to us. My kids  love pulling out the tub of jenga blocks they provide and building away on the table while waiting for our food. A trip wouldn't be complete without saying hi to the giant panda statue and giving him a big hug. The end to your meal is always finished with a giant freshly baked snickerdoodle cookie that tastes unlike any other! I highly recommend everyone that enjoys mexican or Asian food to give this fusion a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ohh chino bandido is my go to for a hangover a lazy Sunday at home or a day I just don't want to cook I'll forever crave chino bandido and I recommend this place every time I'm in a conversation about restaurants or food tasting food!"}
{"text":"We came here w/ some out of town friends who actually got a recommendation from their concierge to come here. Im so glad we did.

Its kind of hidden in a tiny strip mall, you will most likely pass it at least once.

Yes, this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. Yes, some people find their mascot \"offensive\". Yes, the food really is good.

As a 1st timer there, we were treated to a mini tasting for some of their most popular choices: 2 rices, 2 beans, and 4 meats. I decided on the combination plate. I chose the emerald and jerk chicken w/ re-fried beans, and jerk fried rice. Both the chickens were moist and flavorful, and I loved the rice. And who doesnt love an end of meal cookie?

The decor is....minimalist? Seat yourself at one of their many tables, in one of 2 rooms and enjoy your very unique meal!"}
{"text":"This may be the best fast-food place in the valley. It's amazing that Chino Bandido has been around for almost 2 decades and it hasn't been franchised across the country. I guess the location has something to do with it... it's out of the way and just perfect to keep it somewhat of a secret.  Somehow their Mexican, Chinese, Caribbean, and other Asian choices all seem to blend together beautifully. Finish it off with a Snickerdoodle and you've had yourself one delicious, albeit not so healthy, meal."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Don't be intimidated by the order process. Must have: carnitas. We prefer it in a quesadilla"}
{"text":"Wow, Mexican and Chinese,  GREAT Combinations...  It has now become a Staple of our lunch schedule...  Chino Fridays"}
{"text":"My first time at a Asian/Mexican fusion place and it was that gimmick that made me want to come. 

My coworkers warned me that the jade red chicken (most popular dish) is actually not that great so I went for the egg foo yung.  I got the smaller rice bowl and it was more than enough to fill me up.  The chicken fried rice was yummy, but also really heavy and unhealthy.  A satisfying meal, but not worth the hype.     

It's kind of funny, but my favorite part about Chino Bandido was the iced tea... it was simple and yet SO GOOD.  It goes really well with the meal and washes everything down."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this restaurant but was always hesitant to try it. I finally decided to give it a go and I would say that it was pretty good. 

Given that I had never been here before, I was kind of pressed on what to eat. I always love when employees can provide recommendations, so I went with some favorites of the guy who helped me. I ended up getting the Jade red chicken, jerk rice, spicy black beans, and a chicken quesadilla. I was always under the impression that the serving sizes would be huge, but it seemed moderately portioned, which was ok. I can't say that I agree the the flavors really fall under Asian and Mexican but whatever. 

No complaints on the food itself. I probably would try a different rice next time, but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"I give Chinos 5 stars.  Well, 5 stars for a lunch place, dinner places require more ambiance than what you get at Chinos.   The place is a lunch dive, but a very delicious lunch dive. The best dishes are the spicy ones, so if you don't like spicy, shame on your tasteless life, and you should not go here.  

For ordering, you can get the food \"as is\", melted in a quesadilla, or wrapped in a tortilla as a burrito.  I get the two-item plate; Jerk Chicken as a quesadilla, the Jen red pork, the black refried beans and the jerk fried rice.  The food is served in an aluminum pie pan and you get your choice of chop sticks or plastic-ware.  This is a lunch place, don't expect fancy.   Also, they serve you a top-notch snickerdoodle with the meal, although on the weekend the choice of cookie is expanded.  

Overall, it is my favorite lunch place in all of Phoenix.  Afterall, in my opinion, lunch is about the food first, price second, and lastly ambiance."}
{"text":"Been eating at this restaurant my whole life, and I have always loved it.  The food hasn't changed in 25 years.  Jade red chicken is obviously a favorite here.  The cuban black beans and jerk fried rice are the two perfect sides to go with.  You can order any of the meats here inside a burrito or quesadilla too, for some variety :D"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chino for about 25 years now, and this place is both unique and delicious. I always take my friends visiting from out of town here to try it and all of them always enjoy it. This is also a very popular spot for lunch if you work in Chandler, give it try!"}
{"text":"Even though this is the original location I used to go to the Chandler location when that was open. Since that is no more, I hadn't been to Chino in ages. Luckily, upon this visit I discovered it was just as good as I remembered it. 

I got the jade red chicken with white rice and black beans. The chicken is so good but really spicy. I'm sure some people wouldn't think it's too spicy but I'm a wimp when it comes to the heat so I could go down a notch. But that being said - I still ate it! The combo of the chicken with the rice and beans somehow just works so well. 

And I love that you get a cookie with your meal too. A nice little bonus for sure. 

Like others have said - this place is a dive, but the food is worth the visit. And if you need a better atmosphere, take it to go. It's called Chino Bandito Takee-Outee for a reason."}
{"text":"I know you can't stay away from this place, but don't go to Chino's for lunch. Seriously.  It's packed.  You have to wait in line forever.  Go for dinner..... 

I'm convinced that the food here is truly addictive.  I have tried to stay away, but i can't.  The carnitas and egg foo yung keep calling my name.  I have been known to bring their volcano cookies and a pound of just about any entree to potluck dinners.

I like to take \"Chino Virgins\" there so that they can taste from the sample selection.  Then I watch them get all confused when they have to choose just 1 or 2 things.  (I'm easily entertained.)

Try this.  Emerald chicken Quesedilla with sour cream and lettuce. mmmm foodgasms."}
{"text":"Okaaay, so my fiance really wanted to go here for dinner last night, but I was weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked him into something else, then  again today, pleeeease, Chino Tori? Fine, I gave in. 

I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel. 

Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.

So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing. Thirdly, the space is weird and desolate, some interior changes would be a good thing."}
{"text":"Is this place a world wonder? Or was it created by an act of god? Was it an offspring of a Latina and an Asian? Maybe it was a miracle of science? It most likely happened when they put a panda in a fusing machine with a burrito and thus the restaurant Chino Bandido was created. However the restaurant was created, it has some of the most unique food I ever had. The restaurant is a fuse of Mexican cuisines and Asian flavors and a lot of creativity to make a unique menu.

If it is your first time at the place or you want to try something new on the menu, I would suggest asking for a sample of some of their dishes. Once you figure out which ones are your favorites, you have the next hard task of figuring out whether you want it on a dish, in a burrito, or a quesadilla. All of these choices give you reason to come back several times over to try out something new each time and you can't do it in one sitting because the amount they give you is quite filling.

Also makes sure to take a picture of the panda in sombrero with the awesome mustache or selfie with it."}
{"text":"people in phoenix will think this is a cool idea and the food is good, but as chinese, it's really just mediocre chinese food with tortillas mixed in.  i can't be a fan cuz the value is not there.  you know you can get those kinds of chinese food elsewhere for cheap, but when you're in the phoenix area, what can you do?"}
{"text":"Big portions.  Jade Red Chicken taste like Orange Chicken with a kick.  Jerk Fried Rice was a little dry.  The black beans was really good."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of my favorite places. It's kind of like Mexican food and Chinese food had a baby.
I personally love the jade red chicken put inside quesadillas. They also have the best snickerdoodles which is a bonus that comes with the meal.
The service is nice and they will offer help with ordering if it's your first time there. It's also very affordable for all the food you get."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food and fast service.   They've been around for quite a while and the quality hasn't change a bit."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food.  I love Mexican food (or at least, Ameri-mex).   What better idea than to put these two together?  These guys are freakin geniuses.  I got jade chicken in a burrito, how cool is that?  

It would be 5 stars, but I, honestly, didn't think the food blew me away.  It was good, and it was inventive, but not mindblowing.  

One thing I did think was really cool was the little cinnamon flavored hockey puck you get for dessert.  It's not like the southern Snickerdoodles I've had before, but it's odd, which means it perfectly fits."}
{"text":"***Cockroach in my meal***
So, you can't do zero stars, but you can love it or leave it! Here you go! This was in my Gringo Chicken. No way! Forget it!!!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido was kind of an off-the-wall suggestion I received when I was inquiring to some locals on where to eat in the general Phoenix area.  But when I went to the website and saw the horribly ironic image of a giant panda wearing a bullet belt and sombrero, I knew that this was a place that I had to go to.

GPS led me on a path that would require traversing over a giant wall to get to Chino Bandido, but I eventually found the actual entrance in an actual parking lot nearby.  Upon arriving, my first thought was \"wow, this place has A LOT of space.\"  Seriously, very open restaurant.

Anyway, the cashiers were helpful to a tourist like me fill out my order, and I guess I ordered jerk chicken with rice, because that's what I ended up getting.  Now I consider myself to have a very high threshold for spicy foods, but Chino Bandido's jerk chicken was ridiculous.  After the first few bites, my mouth was literally burning up.  It was good, but man, was the heat it made unexpected.

Not to go unnoticed, but the sugar cookie that came with the meal was really, really good too.

Conclusively, friendly young staff, quick service, and amusing albeit a little on the tasteless side of decor, and I'm glad I made a trip down to Chandler to try this place out.  I made sure to get a shirt too, because I'm into tasteless t-shirts like that."}
{"text":"This is an adventure in food. Ready your taste buds for a party!
Try the BBQ sauce, jade red chicken and the emerald chicken."}
{"text":"The Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Chicken Fried Rice were both really strong.  After all the hype I had heard about it, I was kind of disappointed to be honest.  It was still enjoyable to find the culinary mixes of Chinese and Mexican, but I fault the people who hyped it up more than the restaurant itself.  Definitely worth checking out, and I'll go there again."}
{"text":"So I have heard of this place from co-workers and friends and finally today I decided to go for it. I was not disappointed. I can eat.. A lot in one sitting and I enjoy tasty food. The amount of food you get for your money is awesome and the dishes are amazing.   Jerk rice, refried beans, and jade chicken in a quesadilla, with Diablo chicken was outstanding. Will definitely be coming back here and for sure going to tell everyone I know how great this place is."}
{"text":"Out of town guests will usually want to go here based on the history, but that is usually the only time that I'll go.  My last meal there (BBQ Pork) wasn't very good (dry and lacking flavor), but other meals have been good.  Rarely ever eat in.  Cookies are delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the Cuban black beans and the Jerk Chicken with Jerk Chicken Rice.  Everything tasted fresh, had great spice and the customer service was over the top good...  I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Have to downgrade. Not sure it is even A-OK at this point. Only good things last night were my emerald chicken burrito and diet Dr Pepper. I used to come here weekly but stayed away for a long time due to a yucky rice experience in 2010.  I gave them another chance because I thought maybe yucky rice was due to it being a half hour before closing so it wasn't the freshest.  I don't think I will give them another chance. Sad because they are good people. And because snickerdoodles!"}
{"text":"I tried this place like 15 years ago and I have to admit the menu is still no easier to figure out. 

OK I get it it's a hybrid: it's Asian and Mexican together, so it's going to be odd at the outset. 

Let me give me an idea how confusing it is: I've fallen in love with the jerk chicken and yesterday When I ordered, the not so \"knowledgeable\" staff not only gave me white rice instead of jerk-fried rice, she didn't even offer me jerk-fried rice. Hi don't know, maybe after 30 visits are mastered the menu seems like a lot of work. 

The jerk chicken along with the jerk fried rice is absurd to licious but it is not for the faint-at-heart: it's really, really spicy... And absolutely delicious!

In addition:

* the best black beans I've ever had, EVER!

* Great jerk chicken but again, very spicy. Delicious. 

*  I did not care for the jade red chicken; the breading was way too heavy, flavor: just eh.

* many other dishes on the menu with less spice (then jerk chicken) and no breading I haven't yet tried. 

Overall, how can you not like this place. Originality, flavor. Try it. 

P.S.  There is one failure on the menu I've found: the chili relleño.  It sucks from start to finish. The breading is waaaaay too heavy, like the breading you'll find on deep fried ice cream; the cheese is processed American and it taste like it. 
So stay away from the chili relleño."}
{"text":"My first time I went there, I had a really good experience. There was an Asian girl who took my order and she was very nice and kind. I told her it was my first time there and she helped me decide what to get. I settle on ordering the Jade Chicken burrito. I said I wanted lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream in the burrito. She wrote up the ticket and the burrito was delicious. 2 weeks later, I decided to go back and order the same thing I had the first time, only this  time--I did NOT have a very good experience. A white woman took my order and seem to not know what she was doing. I told her that I wanted a Jade Chicken burrito. I told her what I wanted inside (standard burrito filling: lettuce, onions, tomato, cheese, sour cream). What came out of her mouth was the most idiotic thing I had ever heard, \"We can't make that.\" I explained that I had it before and there was no problem. She said, \"Sometimes they can make it and sometimes they can't because the tortilla is small and all of that may not fit.\" WHAT??? Was she serious? Then she repeated my order and said, \"You ordered the Jade Chicken and salad.\" I told her that I did not order a salad. She pointed to a picture on the wall behind the counter of a salad that included broccoli and what looked like carrots. I said, \"I don't want all that in my burrito. I don't want broccoli.\" She wrote \"no broccoli\" on the ticket. I reminded her again what I wanted in my burrito. I also said, \"That burrito was really good and that is the reason why I'm back for a second time. I hope it is made the same way again.\" She said she can't write on the ticket what I want in the burrito because the ticket \"doesn't have enough room\". I told her that the person who took my order the first time I was there had no problem writing the ticket or understanding what I'm wanting. She wasn't very friendly and seemed to not understand simple instructions. I then spoke to someone else and asked if my burrito could be made like I had before. He seemed to have NO problem understanding what I was saying, but by that point I was completely turned off and had lost my appetite from dealing with the inept order taker. Finally my ticket reached the kitchen. The person making my burrito looked SO confused! She kept looking at the ticket as if she didn't know WHAT to put in the burrito. I saw she put just a sprinkle of cheese (before it was plenty). Then she hesitated and read the ticket again and then put lettuce on the meat. Then starred back at the ticket again. Then hesitated and grabbed some tomatoes. This continued until everything was in there. I couldn't believe it. It is SIMPLE, TYPICAL BURRITO FILLING: lettuce, onions, tomatoes, sour cream, and cheese. It's not like I ordered: mushrooms, pickles, cucumbers, and croutons to put in the damn thing. I finally got my order, go t in my care and took a bite. Wrong meat. It was not Jade Chicken. Nice. After all that unnecessary angst, it is not surprising to say that I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Too much confusion. Not worth the hassle. Lady who took my order and couldn't understand how to write the ticket and who told me, \"Sometimes they can make it and sometimes they can't\" you have just cost Chino Bandido a potentially loyal customer. That was my second and LAST visit thanks to you."}
{"text":"A solid 3 for sure.

I am not sure what all the hype is about. It was decent food but not anything amazing at all. 

The black beans were way tasty.
The chicken fried rice was pretty bland and dry. 

The teriyaki chicken was wayyyy super tasty, I would get that again if we go back. 

The carnitas quesadilla was ok. The contents was not spread evenly, one triangle had almost no cheese or meat and one section seemed to have all the meat and no cheese. 

The Snickerdoodle cookie is seriously what would make me go back!! It was RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING! Seriously people. 

The place itself is very, ummmm, gross? Also they don't have a spot to leave a tip if you pay with a card, that's a bum out for the employees."}
{"text":"I love this place, clean and just simple, but so good. The Red jade chicken is amazing and get it in a Quesadilla! There's always cookies too."}
{"text":"It's dangerous living so close to chino. Mmmm so good I'm craving it now!! A+++ who cares they have fold up tables. The weekend cookie never disappoints either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here, on not the nicest part of town nor in the nicest building and I skeptically stared at the mariachi/wild-west panda statue that stood in the corner (if nothing else this statue is picture worthy). I then skeptically tried orange chicken in a quesidilla (the expected meal from the statue) and was socked by how much i actually like it! It was so much food too that my bf and I could split a meal and the workers are so kind- they gave us an extra cookie so we could each have our own! (:"}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place, I thought it sounded ridiculous.  It was presented to me as the \"orange chicken burrito\" place.  I assumed it was a bad Chinese restaurant trying to come up with some innovative (but really just lame) fusion idea. However, my coworkers who have been out to Phoenix all raved about it, so we decided to give it a try. 

I was blown away. 

It's one of those places where you shouldn't be expecting to eat anything \"authentic\".  You should just eat it as food.  It was delicious. 

I was here yesterday for my 'annual' visit and ordered the 2-item combo plate with jade chicken and emerald chicken and side of black beans and jerk fried rice.  So delicious.  Although I am not a huge fan of fried food, I actually liked the jade chicken more than the emerald chicken.  The jade chicken was tender, juicy and had the perfect flavored sauce.  It's not your ordinary orange chicken.  The emerald chicken was great with the ginger/green onion sauce (that is authentic), but it was just too much meat for me.  The beans and rice were SO good.  

I have recommended this place to all my friends/coworkers who travel to Phoenix and definitely will be coming back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jerk fried chicken is bomb and I love the Jade red chicken. Such a cool concept and wish there were more around town. So...get on it Chino Bandido!"}
{"text":"I feel that I was misled by the high rating of this establishment. I was very disappointed, and rarely say such a thing.... I hate to be the one to do it, but other Yelpers need to know what they are getting into with this place.

The concept sounds great on paper, and I'm certain that it could work well if executed properly, but they have a great deal of culinary improvements to make before they will get any approval from me.

The employees who explained the menu were very friendly people, but the quality of the food, was completely lacking in my opinion.

The majority of the chicken dishes seem to consist of breaded, deep fried, chicked bites, each with a different choice of sauce, and then served over rice which is cooked in a choice of styles or sauces. It is similar to the orange Chicken at Panda Express, but extremely dry and very low quality.

We ordered three diffferent types of their employee recommended chicken and rice dishes, and they all tasted very similar for obvious reasons, but most of the chicken was too dry to eat. It was by no means a satisfying meal.

The mexican side, we had a couple of different tostadas, and i remember one of them being ok, but was nothing special. The quesadillas that we ordered were terrible as well.  I can't remember the last time that we threw away our food at a restaurant, but we left very unsatisfied and ended up happier, eating nachos at the Horse Track..lol

I can see this as being a fun gimmick for little kids who like the idea and have no guage of quality food, but for it being a must try for a Yelper, I give it a two thumbs down. It looks like a school cafeteria in the seating area.

I would be willing to give this place another shot if they step up the quality of their food. I do like the concept and would love to see this concept done right.

Cheers and best wishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great combinations of Chinese and Mexican.  Spicy but not too much heat.  Great hole in the wall lunch spot."}
{"text":"Unique Menu with incredible flavor. Can't wait to go back again! The place can be a packed mad house but for a reason . The food is amazing."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! The Jade Red Chicken, Diablo Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk fried rice are all bomb!! One of my favorite places!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. 5 stars all the way. So delicious and the staff was so friendly. The menu can get a little confusing so just go up to the lady and she will explain everything! I got the jade chicken with a pollo diablo quesadilla with rice and black beans. Ugh so yummy highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the chili relleno, it was good, but it had no sauce on it...missed opportunity for sure..sauce gives food life, especially with their Mexican Asian premiss.  If they could engineer a Mexican Asian fusion sauce to put on that Relleno it would knock it out of the park for sure."}
{"text":"I never in my life would have thought that mixing Chinese with Mexican would be a good idea.

I was wrong, and boy, I am so happy that I was wrong.

Chino is a strange fusion restaurant in a slowly dieing shopping center, but keeps up the business alone.

They mix bold flavors together,  and it comes out great. Cuban Black Beans, spicy with a hint of sweet,  Caribbean Jerk Rice, that stays absolutely spicy, and their mexican and chinese choices are amazing. The chinese ones have great sauces, and the mexican ones have been stewed to perfection.

Also, they give you snickerdoodles, fresh ones.

Excellent restaurant, I will continue to go as long as they last."}
{"text":"So we went down to Arizona for a few days and found this little jewel! We heard a lot about this place from the locals with mixed reviews but after catching the episode of Diners, Drive-In's and Dives we decided to take the plunge.


The mixture of Chinese and Mexican wouldn't be an obvious jump at me combination but oddly enough, it works incredibly well!

 Amazing carnitas, jerk fried rice, and black beans...if your looking for something out of the ordinary, cheap and delicioso, look no further. A staple with the locals and a must stop for out of towner's (like us)!"}
{"text":"I went here for a work lunch and was very disappointed. My co-workers had been talking about the Chinese-Mexican food for a couple weeks. While it kinda worked, I wont be repeating the experience. As for environment, I have not seen a more unpleasant location in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place does it right!  new to the joint?  here try 6 samples so you can get up to speed.  I loved my first visit (and each after) since they take all the guess work out of finding something you'll like (or love!)  I knew this was a good place when I walked in and saw all the police eating dinner.  Any place crowded with police or firemen has good food."}
{"text":"Not sure about all the hubbub.   The samples were nice but the food didn't do anything special for me.   The cookies at the end were delightful.   

I'm not sure that Chinese and Mexican belong together.   My husband liked the relleno but wasn't wild about it.    

The people were all incredibly nice hence 2 stars."}
{"text":"the food was fantastic. the red jade chicken was so crispy and delish, i also loved the jerk chicken fried rice. both me and my husband were very satisfied. My only suggestion would be for them to update their dining room. it looks like it is getting a little run down, like a cafeteria. but we came for the food and were very happy. my husband was especially happy about the bonus cookie they give you for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow ! Stumbled across this place and so glad I did ! So so good , service is friendly . He asked if this was our 1st time and offered samples ! Food arrived and to our surprise you even get a free cookie . Food was DELISH ! Jerk rice was amazing , quesadilla with Machaca meat is the way to go ;) and to top it off with a cherry on top I found out this is one of the spots Guy  Fieri stopped at on his show..(I had no clue and I love him) .  We will def be back !!"}
{"text":"I started out on the suicide plate  and I'm still here.   

I think I just have to accept it that I've either burned out my palette or  the general public can't tell really spicy from  a hole in the ground.  It's not a macho thing  peppers are my anti drug. :)   You get the heart racing, cold sweats  , paranoia that you're never coming down. So while this one isn't  Bava or Choco   the Panda is still good  shit.    

The taste tour and instructions on filling out the menu are a very nice introduction to what one reviewer has called  a  food court fight.   I have to agree.

I came from Scotland and in the afternoon the Chinese  restaurants opened, yep  Chinese food was an evening  item. The first time I say it in a mall  at 10am I just had to have it, it just wasn't done , not very.. British:) 

 Neither was mixing it with an order from the Italian, I could have invented Mamma Bandidos years back:D   Keeping that history in mind I was so ready to love this place after reading the reviews. After   Pollo Diablo, Jerk rice, Jerk Chicken and the black bean plate I  will   marry this store if Prop 102 doesn't mess that up too.  I'll still cheat on her with Pizza a Metro but  I think the Italian part will understand:)

Ok the pollo diablo  was  crispy better than any buffet attempt  , or most  low to mid chinese eateries  not tough in the middle , full of garlic and  damn it's good. So good that I am glad the recipe for that is up on the Food Network site and plan to make this soon. 

The rice and beans on their own are again better than I expected it.  They are doing better rice than most Mexican, better stir fry than most Chinese and better jerks than a team of Jamaican weightlifters.    In short  I don't care about the canteen feeling , the cutlery  or the  tin dishes ( hand to pop a lid on to take leftovers in ..should I ever leave any)  

The sum of these parts really adds up to a greater whole in the Wall  and my smile can , I believe , be seen from space.    J"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here since the early 2000s. I can say that portion and quality has gone down. I can also say that depending on the time that you go the food can be terrible. This place has sort of become a gamble to go to. However, I still love their Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Their refried beans are good as well and so are their quesadillas (quesadilla with Jerk or Jade Red chicken). Not everything on the menu is good, especially for me who loves seasoning. I would recommend to stay away from the Gringo Chicken and Emerald Chicken. I would recommend to try the Pollo Diablo or the Chinese Barbecue Pork on top of the Jade Red. Teriyaki chicken is not true Teriyaki (as is most American 'Teriyaki') as it is cut up unseasoned breast meat with sauce poured on top. Overall, for the items that I like solely, this place is four stars. Also, the snickerdoodle cookies are to die for, especially when they come out fresh and warm!"}
{"text":"Yo, you like Chinese food right? And of course you love Mexican food, you're in Arizona. Then you will LOVE this place. The wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them. You can get Jade Chicken in a burrito! Or in a quesadilla! Even if you don't want to combine Mexican food with Chinese food, eating them in a more traditional (?) way is still an amazing treat. 

You can take the food to go and sit down inside. The restaurant setting is a little bare bones but they bring your food to your table so it comes out even? You also get a free cookie so that's awesome!

Possibly the best thing about this place is the mascot. It's probably the most racist mascot ever. Panda wearing a sombrero with six shooter. Ridiculous and I love it"}
{"text":"I love chino's 7Q and 6 No beans and extra Pork Fried Rice. Thats my dish, its my love. I think everytime im back in phoenix i make a stop at chino's because it is that good. I love how you can get (almost) anything on the menu either in a burrito or quesadilla. That makes everything glorious..

So i guess you can be a skeptic at first, chinese and mexican food? yah i thought it sounded weird but EVERYONE i've taken there have always liked it!  This place is one of the best places to eat in phoenix. Very casual and its my favorite way of eating.. Pay first then after you can leave! no need to wait for someone to bring you your check.

If it is your first time going go to the side counter and let them know and they will let you sample the types of food they offer.

Don't expect people to wait on you hand and foot, this just isnt the place for that, if you want that kind of service go to Maggiano's (which is not the same cuisine fyi)"}
{"text":"This Mexican/Chinese fusion house is a Phoenix gem. It's definitely a hole in the wall but a loved one at that. CB is the only place I've eaten at that I use chopsticks for my rice and beans. The ambiance is fun and unique. It's set up cafeteria style and has a large statue of a panda with a sombrero that the kids love. It has even been featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri. But like I said, it's a hole in the wall/dive for sure, so don't expect beautiful decor. Expect good food.

The food is always great, and you can get free samples of whatever you want to try. Plus you get cookie with every order. My all time fav is the jerk chicken or pollo diablo but beware for all of you weaklings, they are spicy! The rice and beans are great and if you want a more mild flavor, the jade red chicken quesadilla is another fav of mine.

If you're new, the menu and ordering system can be a bit tricky and intimidating at first, but you'll get the hang of it. If you have any questions, someone will be right there to help! Once you get it down, you will feel like a pro. Let your tastebuds enjoy the deliciousness Chino Bandito has to offer. MMMM yum!! My mouth is watering!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Came in for the first time the other night and had no idea what I wanted, but was offered samples of the most popular items to give me an idea of what the food was like and help narrow down. The food was AMAZING! I expected it to be good, but I had no idea. Would reccomend to everybody. Not a single complaint. If you haven't been, go now!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, and haven't had anything quite like it. 

When my colleague first suggested it - a place that combined Chinese & Mexican - I was intrigued. Then he mentioned it was featured on the Food network. Sure, I was in. 

Since I had no expectations going in (how could I possibly expect anything? I had no idea how you could combine these two cuisines), I was quite pleased with the result. I got the Jade Red chicken and the Pollo Diablo, and loved both!"}
{"text":"The food is super yummy. I've never been to the restaurant to eat, I always order it for delivery, but my order is always right an spook tasty. Love it"}
{"text":"Sad there's only 1 location!!! But this spot is soo good! Jade red chicken is my favorite !!"}
{"text":"Totally a fan of this place since before I joined the Military in 04. We enjoy coming to this place to forget about our diet and it's one of my favorite \"dive's\" ever. The Jade chicken is the bomb, the hot sauce is tangy sweet and they go well together in a burro or quesidilla. The Jerk fried rice is great, and the Jerk / Pollo Diabllo are great spicy options. I always leave this place so full I'm sick so I guess it's a great place to get out and try. Be sure to take samples if you are new so you can really tell what you like. Guy F was here and he had this expression of indulgence which I seem to mirror every time I eat here. Some say it's hit or miss but this place has never been a miss for me.


Viva la Bandido!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that Chino Bandido, an establishment that has been around since 1990, was light years ahead of the rest of the food culture when it came to fusion concepts. For this alone, you have to give Chino credit for being an innovator of sorts. And given that they are one of the most frequently reviewed restaurants on Yelp within the Phoenix area, it's obvious that they've amassed quite a following over the years.

I've only dined here three times. Originally, I went with some work colleagues after their publicity from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Additionally, my girlfriend and have dined here twice.

As many people point out, Chino is located in a bit of a sketchy area that seems to get increasingly more uncomfortable deeper into the night. Nevertheless, it seems to receive a lot of business from people who appear to be regulars. Their menu cards are a bit odd, but they're willing to help you if you're confused on how to order. I like that they offer samples of their meats in order to reduce the risk of making mistakes.

I've had their Jade Red Chicken a few times and have always found it to have fairly decent quality for the price. Their Chile Relleno, something I decided to take a risk on (since sampling it is forbidden), ended up being a surprise hit. Traditional rice and jerk fried rice are both decent as well. Throwing in a free snicker doodle cookie with each meal is a nice touch.

I suggest that you be realistic. Don't go in here expecting to eat high-end cuisine that's on par with what you'd receive at a five star restaurant. It's the equivalent of \"fast casual\" - without the sleek IKEA-ish decor, of course.

I don't feel it's the best Mexican or Chinese food I've ever eaten, nor is it something that I find myself craving in the same manner that other people seem to on a regular basis. But for what it's worth, by the standards of \"dive\" food, it's good enough."}
{"text":"Mexican Chinese fusion....ummm yes please.  This place is alil hole in the wall spot and it's pretty. I get the jerk chicken with rice. Food tasty service fast. If you like spicy this place doesnt disappoint."}
{"text":"I enjoy hitting this place when on the north side.   Try things first!   Then mix two that go great along with the tasty rice and black beans.  The cookie is a perfect end to this meal."}
{"text":"Ok, the hype might have gotten to me because what I ordered (Jade chicken, emerald chicken, black beans, and jerk rice) wasn't anything \"amazing\". I am actually still baffled by the very combination and for the fact that I put on salsa on the weird mix. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but I am really surprised that everyone is so in love with this place. I do have to admit that I do plan on going back to try a different combination because I feel like the hype has to be there for a reason and I might be overlooking the obvious. I read a couple of yelpers talk about the cheese crisp, so I might add that into the mix to see how that is. I will post back when I venture back to Chino Bandido's."}
{"text":"Here's the story, of some Chinese chicken... served with different styles of rice... all of them had different sauces, the lightest one not very Spicy.

Here's the story, of beans and burritos... some black beans, others refried. Both of them were very tasty, but also guaranteed to keep you on the pot all night.

So, this one day when the chicken met the beans and burritos... they knew that it was much more than a hunch... that this group should somehow join together, and that's the way they all became my greasy lunch.

While I was developing this article I tried to categorize Chino Bandido. I went back and forth between Mexican and Chinese over ten times before I just put it under both categories. However, Chino really isn't Chinese, Mexican, or Chinese-Mexican Fusion; it's really its own type of food. Speaking of Fusion, what the hell is that? The only Fusion that comes out of Chino Bandido is the mix of ethnic food in your stomach that will prohibit you from any sort of activity while it's digesting. Anyway, let's get into it.

Chino is nothing fancy. It's discreetly hidden behind a Walgreens off the main road. When you walk in you will notice that it is furnished with Costco folding tables and chairs, exposed duct work, concrete floor, and very little decoration on the walls except for an autographed Guy Fieri poster in the back. It's pretty simple. Gentleman, a word to the wise: don't expect to get laid if you bring a lady here on a first date.

As usual, I checked out Chino's menu on their website before I left the house. I'm no rocket scientist, but you need a quantum physics degree to figure out their ordering system. However, Chino has attempted to make ordering a bit easier by implementing ordering instructions and a simulator on their website. The staff at Chino's is awesome and will guide you through the ordering process and let you sample everything on the menu first anyway. If you read my previous post on Costco samples, you know that Chino giving samples wins hearts and minds in my book.

My first time at Chino I tried the Jade Red Chicken, the BBQ pork in a burrito, refried beans, and Jerk Fried Rice. The Jade red chicken was decent. It was like a General Tso's Chicken on steroids. A fried texture; super spicy and super sweet. The BBQ pork was alright but a little bland. While reading Yelp I remember running across someone's Yelp review that stated he loved the Jade Red Chicken so much that he was pissed off that the BBQ pork had to share the plate with it. Uh yeah, it didn't bother me that much. The Jerk fried rice was pretty good as well... it included jerk chicken and green onions. Chino's gets props for originality, giving you a lot of food, and making it easy to take home the leftovers. Once you slap on the cardboard lid you are all set to take it home and have it for breakfast the next day.

The best part about Chino Bandido (and best value) is the bonus they give you; the Snickerdoodle or Chocolate Volcano cookie (baked during weekends).

I opted for the Chocolate Volcano cookie and let me just say that thing was damn good. I will admit that the food was probably not enough to bring me back to Chino Bandido that often, but that cookie just might make it happen. And as for fusion, maybe next week I will try some Korean-Ethiopian-Chilean mix. You just never know."}
{"text":"I would give them more stars if I could! Love, love, love Chinos! I recommend the teriyaki chicken in a burrito (make sure you ask for sauce!) and the jerk chicken in a quesadilla! The snickerdoodles are the best!"}
{"text":"So good! You will not be disappointed! It's a small place in a shopping center. It was easy to find. At first we were not sure what we were doing. However, the young man on the register was very helpful. He gave us samples of the different meats (make sure you ask for some). 
As soon as we tasted, we were sold! Everything we ordered was delicious! Jerk fried rice and black beans are a must! We had the Jade red chicken quesadilla and a side of Machaca! It comes in a tin (bowl style)  

We got our food pretty fast. They bring it to your table. We will definitely be back, if in town. It was also featured in Diners Drive in and Dine. I see why! You will love it too!"}
{"text":"If I'm ever up for a grease-laden meal, I know where to go. The carnitas was probably my favorite item from my combo meal. Meat was tender and juicy. Jade red chicken reminded me of Panda Express Orange Chicken just with a different sauce. Fried rice seemed a bit dry. Refried black beans had a nice spicy kick to them."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome lunch spot for at or under 10$. Jade red burro is bomb, if you're a newbie have them give you samples of the meat you're interested in and that way you can try before making a commitment. 

The only time people give me negative reviews is when they've never been there and take a shot at what to order. It's Chinese and Mexican; done right is great, done wrong is just weird..

Side note, if management sees this and could relay it to the cooks, last time I was there  I had over half of my white rice harder than a rock. I'm assuming they scooped the edge on an old pan but come on.. No one wants hard rice in with their food. I get saving where you can but that's not acceptable."}
{"text":"I was dragged to Chino Bandido the other day my a work buddy who said that this place was right up my alley. After checking out Yelp and reading their menu I was beyond excited to see what everyone was raving about!
My friend informed me about their ordering process and also told me since I was a newbie they always let people try a sampling of all of their popular dishes (which was totally awesome since there are tons of choices). After trying a few things I decided to go with the Jerk Fried Rice, their special black beans, the Jade Red Chicken and a chili rellano (which they coat in Saltines and deep fry), best part is every dish comes with a delicious snicker doodle cookie! 
The food was good, my jade chicken was a little too soggy for my liking but the flavor was mostly there minus my own personal preference of wanting some hot sauce (they have some awesome sauce by the cash register). My chili rellano was delicious and super crunchy but still fell kinda flat flavor wise. It seemed like things were either soggy, not hot or just lacking something.
Would I come back, yeah for sure but I won't be making a special trip."}
{"text":"The Emerald Chicken, double order, with extra sauce and black beans is simply divine. Love this place and love it's only a couple blocks away!"}
{"text":"Best food in Phoenix!!! I recommend to EVERYONE!! It's a hole in the wall of a restaurant with plastic tables and chairs... but it kind of adds to the experience. can't say enough how delicious the food is.... its like a combination of Mexican and Chinese! I always a Jade chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, chicken fried rice, and black beans!!! Then to top off the delicious meal you get a homemade cookie.... team snickerdoodle or die!! If you have not been here then it is a MUST!! 

PS come hungry!!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! Great mixture of two kinds of flavor . I usually go to pick up our food on our lunch break . I never have to wait extra time .Food is ready to go when you pick up regardless if it's packed . Trust me this place gets pretty packed . My favorite part is that it's always HOT not warm HOT and that's a plus especially when pick up to go . The gentleman upfront are great and all very friendly . 

Reg lunch order 
Chicken fried rice 
Jade red chicken 
Pollo Diablo or machaka 
1/2 dozen of cookies"}
{"text":"I'm so torn.  This place could be really good, and parts of it were.  I did enjoy their samples, and it definitely told me what was good and what was not.  Their system of ordering and the options you can choose are awesome.  

The jerk chicken rice and the black beans were the best part of the meal.  I didn't care for the red jade chicken.  It was just greasy sweet and sour chicken.  Takeout status.  I did enjoy the carnitas burrito, but why would I order that here if I can just go some real Mexican place anywhere else?  

Oh, your meal also comes with a cookie.  Snickerdoodle, to be precise."}
{"text":"It's fine. It's definitely something funky to try. But I don't crave this place, and my belly sure as hell doesn't."}
{"text":"My dad and I came here after a round at Papago.
Yes I came here because it was on DDD.

They lady behind the counter was super cool and gave us a bunch of samples before we ordered. My dad wanted the macheca before the sample and wanted it even more after. He said that this was the best place ive picked. Its not the best but it was really good.

I ordered the jade red chicken in a quesidalla and the jerk chicken in a burrito and i also got the refried beans.
I really liked the jade red chicken and i would order that every time. I wouldnt order the jerk chicken again.
It also came with a cookie that is like a churro in cookie form and it was great also."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phoenix! We have been going here for lunch for many years and love it each time. My favorite is the carnitas and jade red chicken. We don't head there too often, but when we do, it is always worth the drive and full stomachs! Don't forget to save room for the snickerdoodle cookies at the end!"}
{"text":"Great and affordable food ... Service is also great ...They really help you in choosing the food..

Ambiance is OK but has lot of scope to improve on it."}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix, this is the place to try. The \"Jade Red Chicken\" is outstanding."}
{"text":"Fried food, trashy decor, a part of greater Phoenix that you'd have no reason being in...It's greasy spoon eating at its best!

I stopped at this place on the way to a vacation in Sedona since it's off the highway toward Sedona. It was recommended by Drive-In's, Diner's, and Dives, a.k.a. Triple-D, so I figure it couldn't be too bad.

Just don't call it Chinese. Don't even call it Mexican. But it's darn good food!

There's lots of good variety, and all the dishes are really unique and tasty. Don't know what to get? Ask the order-taker for a sample. Everything I had was good.

And I love the restaurant's devotion to its suggestively racist mascot, a panda with a sombrero, long mustache, and ammunition sash, Pancho Villa-style. They even have a freaking statue of him in the middle of the restaurant, standing proud and tall, as if he were a Buddha waiting for restaurant patrons to bow down to him or present him offerings of Diablo Chicken and Snickerdoodles. All is good though, it only adds to the restaurant's eclectic-ness."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido's Mexican, Chinese, and Jamaican mash-up is like Jeremy Lin and the Knicks, Kanye and Coldplay, hot Cheetos and cream cheese - where an unexpected combination creates a product more successful and satisfying than its individual parts. 

Before going any further, note that everything is better in quesadilla form - neither the burrito nor a la carte match up to what a crispy tortilla enveloping a layer of melted cheese can provide.  

The Red Jade Chicken and Jerk Chicken were among my favorites, but the Emerald Chicken blew my mind.  Having been raised in a Chinese household, the chicken breast with fresh ginger and green onion sauce was a staple at every major meal.  However, being crafted into a quesadilla raised this familiar dish's flavor ceiling by 298374908 levels.  Henceforth, whenever I encounter this chicken at a family meal, part of me will inevitably pine for it to be encased in a tortilla, oozing with cheese.

The jerk fried rice and pork fried rice are both flavorful and great complements to the quesadilla, with the pork fried rice coming out slightly ahead in terms of richness in taste.  The jerk chicken overwhelms the rice a bit, while the pork creates a more natural blend with the rest of the ingredients.

As a newcomer, be sure to enroll in the tutorial next to the line, where you will be treated to samples of their most popular items and given instructions to fill out the unique ordering sheet.

Will definitely crave Chino until I return!"}
{"text":"Awesome find! We had the Emerald Chicken (my favorite), Red Jade Chicken, Chile Relleno, and Machaca. My wife loved the black beans! Atmosphere was laid back and the staff was friendly and made the experience a good one. Very inexpensive and would probably be categorized as fast casual. I wish they still had their east valley location!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a restaurant with over 650 reviews that hasn't been said before?  I had the Jade Red Chicken with Pork Fried Rice, the chicken was great, I ate way more of it than I should have.  I wasn't a big fan of the fried rice but that's probably a good thing because I definitely filled up on the Jade Red Chicken.  The people working were nice and the meal comes with a free Snickerdoodle cookie which is awesome.  Have a feeling this place is going to be dangerous since it's within walking distance from my house..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a recommendation from one of my husband's coworkers. It's a nice, open restaurant that feels pretty comfortable. The tables seem overly large for the space, and it feels kind of ridiculous to sit down as just a 2-person party at a table that can seat 8 or 10.

The staff was very nice. When they found out it was our first time, they led us over to an area of the counter where we could try their more popular dishes, and explained their ordering system. I didn't find ordering difficult at all. The food came quickly, accompanied by snickerdoodle cookies (yum!) and I thought the price was great. Had enough left over of my emerald chicken for a delicious lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is ok. Mostly disappointed that they don't make enough Choc chip or volcano cookies."}
{"text":"Pretty great food that's inexpensive. I get the jerk chicken with rice and a side of beans. Where else can you get Asian, Caribbean, and Mexican food all together? I'm a returnee and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The sound of Chinese Mexican fusion may turn you away, so hopefully this review will turn you back. I was extremely skeptical going into the 25 min drive to get here, but they had me at the free sample of carnitas at the front. Tender meat, healthy amount of garlic, well seasoned. Then my combo came and I was even happier to see they took the attention to make the beans and rice flavorful, nothing pisses me off more at a place when the food is great and they use canned beans and minute rice. Finally the cookie sealed the deal, I don't know why you wouldn't eat here. Unless you are on a diet, it isn't exactly health food."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food concept, their portions and have had great food almost every time I've been there. 

The only drawback is their ordering system. If you don't come often, it's hard to remember all the abbreviations and details needed for their ordering form. Their staff hasn't always been eager to make the ordering process easier either. 

Worth figuring out their system for the food though!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with jade red chicken. Very quick to bring your food out and their watermelon tea is a nice refreshment. This place is always packed during lunch and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This combo (Mexican/Chinese) was a first for me, and I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. Jade Red chicken quesadilla, jerk fried rice, and emerald chicken...hallelujah!! Not to mention the snickerdoodle that took grub heaven to another level. I might have to visit my folks more often...."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Good Food and service.  My only concern is the inside looks very old. It should be remodeled with better tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Talk about comfort food! Mexican with Asian, yum! I love their chile rellenos, very crunchy. My favorite meat is the jade red chicken with fried rice and refried beans.... Hmmm makes my mouth water! 

I love how they give you a free cookie! Its fluffy and soft and chewy and a decent size. Also their service is pretty fast. You can take it to go or eat there. It tends to be packed, but not packed in the sense that you get annoyed, its like a revolving door, you see people leaving and people are coming in.

I recommend this place! I'm hoping to move closer!"}
{"text":"Was expecting better after all the hype, and DDD appearance. First of all, the ordering is a little on the complex side- but the guy running the front area was extremely helpful- offering a taste of various dishes. You basically have multiple options to order Mexican and/or Chinese cuisine. So imagine ordering a famous Chinese dish served in a quesadilla ! 

The original location on 19th is basic, basic, basic restaurant. Folding chairs and tables- run down interior, but hey you come here for the food right? Make sure to check out the \"Great Wall of Chino's\" when you enter- lots of cool accolades and the infamous DDD poster signed by Guy himself. The dishes are relatively inexpensive and portions are large. I think I paid less than $10 for a hearty meal and large soda (Pepsi products).

OK - the food. I ordered the jerk chicken quesadilla  (9Q) and it was YUMMY. The tortilla was fresh, slightly crisp and just enough cheese. Definitely the highlight of my plate. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from the 9Q. I also ordered the most popular dish - Jade Red Chicken, basically a spicier sweet and sour dish. The chicken was dry, and was over-fried so the taste was just not there for me. Maybe I experienced a batch that had been cooked and sitting around for a bit? I also got the refried beans (runny & bland) and chicken fried rice. The fried rice was 'meh' - little taste and not really all that friend. I should have tried the jerk chicken fried rice- that might have been better with a flavored chicken. And then- the Snickerdoodle. I read about these cookies on Yelp and the reviews were right- man those cookies are good. Wish I could have snagged a second!

I would be willing to give this place one more try- give a few other dishes a shot, see what I think. You definitely don't go here for ambience- go for the cult following. There was an eclectic lunch crowd when I went!"}
{"text":"Our favorite little place is having serious issues :(
This place has never been known for cleanliness... But this trip revealed a hair in the food, poor service and bad cooking. I won't be back for a while if ever. 
Not the same as it used to be and I have been coming here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"BOMB!!!! Just BOMB! Jerked fried rice and jade red chicken!!!!! And I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"The kind of place you'd never come to if you drove by (unassuming, sketchy strip mall), but thanks to Yelp, have had bookmarked forever and, holy cow! Legit!! 

Mexican / Asian fusion sounds weird, but it works. Don't skip the jade chicken! Little spicy, sweet, perfectly fried and crispy! I paired it with the carnitas, which were very good. Tender and full of flavor (just missing the traditional crispy bits). Black beans from heaven!! 

And the free cookie! Get the snickerdoodle! Such a perfect treat after meal treat! 

Line moves quick, service is fast, and friendly, plenty of seating, reasonable price (my family of 5 ate for around $25)."}

the concept, brilliant

will try this place a few more times for sure"}
{"text":"All I had was a Jade chicken and white rice lunch bowl. This obsession hit me like a train.

My office is just around the corner. I'm concerned for my wallet's well-being.

Please support my gofundme account and keep me out of the poorhouse due to Jade chicken. 

Sincerely, natalie g."}
{"text":"this food is soooo good.  never had mexican asian fusion, but it is soo delicious.  the refried beans are to die for and the jade red chicken is wonderful.  my son loves the hengrenade chicken.  actually everything i have had so far is great.  it's always busy, but you don't usually have to wait to long.  i call ahead for the pick up!!!  it's also very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I had mixed feeling at first and some photos just didn't look to great. But I took a chance and fell in loooove ! I'm such a foodie and this place is BOMB. Highly recommend others who are hesitant on trying it out. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians, move along. No much to see or eat here. (Vegan - NO.)  I got the veggie quesadilla and it came with (actually, under, if you can picture that) raw broccoli bites and some iceberg lettuce. Mr. Amalia C got the chile relleno, which he peeled the cornflake-like breading off and then ate (said it was good), with side of rice and beans. The rice had meat in it, not sure if that was advertised or not. Interesting local color in the place for sure, and friendly staff, but not worth a repeat visit for vegetarians. I gave them that second star on account of the complimentary snickerdoodles. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I think I might have a problem with going here WAY too often. I have noticed I have had to up my cardio ALLOT due to all the awesome food I have that comes from this place. I have tried everything at least 300 times, but my all time 'go to' item is the Emerald Chicken. Oh mama that is good stuff. The black beans and jerk fried rice I would eat on a daily basis. And who else gives you a cookie for ordering? I feel like it's my birthday every time I get a cookie. YUM! 

One thing, try not to use the bathroom so often, it's slightly horrific. And no mirror? Really NO mirror in a woman's bathroom? Just wrong man...so wrong."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Actually forgot about it for a while and then remembered how awesome it is and went back again last night. Red jade chicken is great. Like to get half in quesadilla form and the rest with the beans and rice. Love the jerk fried rice. Portions are huge. The snickerdoodle cookie given with the meal makes my day. A great place to grab food to go in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"After lots of hype, i've finally made the journey here since i was in Phx for work. 
The employees are genuinely helpful- many samples. I apologized for taking steve nash from them. 
The food- i had jade red chicken, chile relleno & jerk fried rice. Super great. The highlight was the flavor explosions, cheese & happiness in my mouth. 
The venue could be improved and would definitely raise the experience to a 5-star. Maybe i brought my high LA hole-in-the-wall standards but, i was disappointed in the lack of ambiance. 
Imagine a hole-in-the-wall cafe w 4-star food for cheap."}
{"text":"Every time I head to Phoenix, I have to head to Chino Bandido. The food is in large portions and very filling! It is interesting how Mexican and Chinese food come together but it seems to work as this place was packed. I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas and it was loaded in raw veggies but I would have liked to remove the cheese and I was not sure if I could because it was so packed in there! 

Try the food out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"on my way to meet my son for dinner at our old stopping ground waaaaaaay back when they were kids.
It's been so long since I've set foot inside there. The food is a twist of Mexican and Chinese. Neat combination and very tasty too.

Dinner date with my son.  Yippee!!"}
{"text":"Hidden away behind a sea of strip malls, this restaurant is a contradiction of itself in a great way. It's Asian and Mexican. It's really fast food, yet everything tastes fresh. The menu board is all pictures and cheap like a 'berto's stand, but the place is big and clean. The tables and chairs are plastic and foldout, but there's a big plasma TV and pictures hanging on the wall. But most important; the food is cheap and fantastic! 

We walked in and I looked at the big menu board in awe. There more than a dozen items listed, and four ways to have them. The combo is any two items with beans and rice. You can also have them wrap up any item in a burrito. Any item served in a quesadillas. Or a single item rice bowl. My girlfriend told the guy at the register that I had never been there before, and he asked me what I was interested in trying. I couldn't make up my mind, so he brought me samples of three of the more popular items. The jade chicken, the jerk chicken, and carintas. I wouldn't have complained about any of the three. I decided to go with the jerk Chicken and jenred Pork combo. You also get a cookie. I went with a chocolate chip (I'll explain in minute why that was mistake). 

I highly recommend the Jerk Chicken if you like hot food. The heat hits you a second or two after you take your first bite. As you continue to eat, it keeps getting hotter but never overpowering. The Jenred Pork was on par with any Asian restaurant's sweet and Sour pork. The black beans in the combo are wonderfully sweet, but not too sweet. The only thing I was disappointed with was the cookie. The chocolate chip cookie was over-baked and too sugary. My girlfriend had a snickerdoodle with her meal, which she said was the best snickerdoodle she's ever had. I tried a small piece. As usual, she was right."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Machaca quesadilla, jade red chicken burrito, chicken fried rice and black beans is a near perfect combo."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is a mishmash of complete awesomeness!  This dive serves up some of the best mexican and asian fast food in the valley, and it's all on one dish.  The ordering process is confusing, and the decor (or lack there of) leaves a ton to be desired, and the place has a dirty feeling and is located in a pretty sketchy strip mall, but that's what creates its charm.

For those who do not know.  Chino offers up mexican and asian foods.  You can have it in a rice bowl, a combo bowl (two items plus beans and rice), grilled up in quesadilla, or wrapped in a burrito.  To order, you get a little form that can be odd to fill out, but they'll help you get it right (I don't get why they don't just ask you what you want and fill it out themselves, but it did feel like an accomplishment to get it right).  The best part about Chino (besides the food) is how friendly the staff is.  When we walked in, I informed the guy who greeted us that my parents had never been to either of their locations, so right away he told them to step on over, and he gave them some generous samples of their more popular dishes, and a pretty good description how the foods were cooked.

The food is high quality fast food.  Very unique and flavorful.  Plus every order comes with a snicker doodle, where can you go wrong?  The dining area is made of plastic costco tables and chairs and a big tv playing espn.  Very odd, but that's what makes Chino the wonderful dive that it is."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their food is amazing, employees are always courteous and the cookies are a wonderful bonus!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. It is an odd fusion of experiences, both the food and the storefront, but the staff is friendly, and the food is good."}
{"text":"The food used to be good but they started slacking on quality. The staff does nothing but joke around in the kitchen and cleanliness is questionable"}
{"text":"Yum. This place is soooooooo good. The food is unique and the flavours go so well together. One of my favorite places for sure."}
{"text":"Three words...Jade Red Chicken. Oh my gosh so good! As well as their emerald chicken. I live a good thirty minutes away and will drive all that way  just for their food! Staff is always super friendly and willing to help you order. Fantastic food and suggest anyone in the area check this place out."}
{"text":"Awsome food combinations & the staff was friendly & helpful. Location was easy to find."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not as good as expected. I got the combo bowl with carnitas and jade red chicken, no rice, and a side of refried beans. Carnitas were decent, didn't care for the chicken, and refried beans were good. I would come back because it is a decent cheap option."}
{"text":"awesome place, great food, fun atmosphere. my only complaint is it's a bit scary the first time you are here, it's fast pace and a bit confusing when you aren't familiar with the menu, since a lot of stuff isn't named like other places. truly a one of a kind place! keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"When I first showed up at Chino Bandido, I was a bit surprised by the interior design of the restaurant. Once I tasted the food, I understood why so many customers were eating there. It's delicious. If you don't know what you feel like eating, they let you taste the food first before you order it. It's a fun Chinese/Mexican diner."}
{"text":"I will drive from Long Beach just for the red jade chicken.... It's kickin!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  It's not fancy, it's not  Eco-friendly but the food is so darn good! It's a flavor explosion that you can't describe unless you've had it. All you need to know is that it's good, it's unique and you need to go here!!"}
{"text":"love it... great service and oh so good cookies ... wasnt sure about trying it because u think chinese mexican food? but it was nothing like that in my opinion . I would go back again mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Why has no one else thought of this before?  This place is awesome!  Yes, it's a bit greasy...and your stomach is usually a little more than confused at what you've just put into it...but your mouth is damn happy!  We tend to go for spicy - so my husband would always get something super hot (pollo diablo, for one) in a quesadilla or burrito (sometimes both).  I've tried some of the sweeter ones (emerald chicken), but I think they really spicy entrees work best.  So so yummy!  They also make a pretty good snickerdoodle to finish off your meal with!"}
{"text":"I think think this place is overrated because of it uniqueness.  I mean, if you've never heard of this restaurant, you've probably never heard of chinese-mexican food.  That said, I think that uniqueness does make it a cool place.  I like the food.  When we went in the girl had us try samples of the different things, and she was super knowledgeable and very kind, not to mention super hot.  I don't know where she was from but she had a super cool accent that I couldn't pin, which definitely added to her hotness.  I almost asked her where she was from but I didn't.  Anyway, when I tried one of the samples she said \"at first it's sweet, and then you'll get a little kick right about.....now!\"  She was dead on I was very impressed.   After the many years this place has been around, I am very surprised they haven't changed the way the ordering works.  It is the most complex system I've ever seen in my life, and I imagine they get complaints all the time.  The flip side to that is that the employees are very eager to make sure you understand how it works, and they help you right along.  The snicker doodles they give with the meal are good.  The atmosphere is a little interesting at this location because it's like a cafeteria.  I would definitely tell everyone to try this place at least once for the experience, and you may decide you love it and come back for more."}
{"text":"We walked in and we were immediately greeted by the general manager. He was excited about their new appetizers as a happy hour special. He mentioned that they had live music, too. We decided to try the Guac-a-dilla as a starter. Both girls wanted the black bean tostadas. I reminded them that was a Saturday special. The manager said that he could talk them in to making it. I ordered the Pollo Diablo as a burrito and the Jerk Chicken as a quesadilla.  BOTH EXCELLENT! It came with black beans and rice. The black beans are creamy, a little sweet, and just enough back heat! Topped off with the best snicker doodles in town! If you haven't been, you gotta get to this place!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I saw a episode of diners drive ins and dives and my gf suggested we try it out. 

Me and my gf spent a loooong day in Sedona AZ and drove two hours to this spot hoping to feed our hunger!  When we arrived the gentlemen at the counter asked if we were first timers (probably because we stared at the menu forever!!) not only was he very patient but he let us try 4 dishes off the menu FREE!!! 

We ended up ordering the Jade chicken over jerk rice with sweet pork (see attached pic) long review short, it was absolutely worth the trip from CALI to try this awesome Gem! 

IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACES 6 STARS I WOULD (not only for the food but the amazing customer service)"}
{"text":"I always get the 7/11Q with black beans and chicken fried rice. I love it. My mom and brother are also obsessed with this place. The snickerdoodle cookie is good but the volcano cookie is amazing, wish it was available all the time or at least every weekend instead of every other. All the different options allow you to change it up every visit if you want to."}
{"text":"Well my first time on the new chino on the east side! First impressions was its cleaner, bigger, and a lot less people so ordering was simple.  Hds my favorite, jade chicken in a quesadilla . The. Red jerk chicken plain with jerked fried rice. Awesome as usual, but seemed a little too greasy for me...I've been to the original Chino several times and never that greasy so I'm taking it that it was just the cook. I still gave it 4 stars..I have the original as 5!..but I'll come back here again to see if the greasiness went down. Overall a good east side restaurant. Too bad there isn't one by the Arrowhead area...but then again I'm spoiled! The original location on 19th will always hold my best reviews!"}
{"text":"Wow! I usually save my 5 star ratings for the truly special
 Restaurants that have it all. Well I don't know is  Bandito had it all but it sure did the nite we ate here!!

We started with a tasting and education on the menu from a very nice worker at the counter. She let us try 6 items but after the second one I was sold!
I ended up doing The 2 combo platter. With emerald chicken and red jade chicken. I choose to have them made into quesadilla. 

We sat down and had to take our photo with the giant panda. Then sat down and a few moments later our food came. Perfect! I also ordered my food with jerk fried rice which also had peices of chicken in it. 
 
I was blown away experience. I totally loved the emerald chicken in a quesadilla.  Possibly the best quesadilla I have ever had. The emerald chicken was just so tasty.   The red jade chicken was also good as a quesadilla but I think It might be better alone with rice.  The red jade is like orange chicken but with a kick!

Overall this is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phx, I will for sure come back and I will try even more!!!!!  I can't believe I've been in Phx most of my life and it took me so long to enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"loved this restaurant. my wife got an order she just didn't like. but they were very kind in helping us replace it entirely. kind patient people. you can get samples before ordering."}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the novelty of it - the food could have been a lot better.  The carnitas were decent (but dry) and the chicken fried rice was ok, very salty though.  The refried beans tasted like they were out of the can. I liked the chile relleno with the saltine coating, it was pretty good. Emerald chicken was bland. The BBQ pork was tasty and the jerk chicken had some nice spice - but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican?  I was confused.

The restaurant is in a creepy converted warehouse.  I felt like a horn was going to go off signaling the end of my break to go back to work. The guy at the counter was patient in explaining how to order and such, but otherwise they weren't the friendliest at the counter.  The free cookies at the end are pretty good."}
{"text":"I've wanted to Try Chino Bandido since I seen it on tv a few years ago. Finally went with two friends today.

Ordering: Way to complicated. I ended up getting Combo, Teriyaki chicken ( safe bet? you'd think so) fried rice and refried beans. Side refried bean and cheese burrito, drink- $14.95 Combo comes with a cookie.

Teriyaki chicken- sauce was good, chicken tasted weird. Fried rice was not good, at all. Refried beans, very tasty. So the small beans and cheese burrito was good. 

Should Fried rice and refried beans really be allowed on the same plate? I now know that answer...No. It looked like I cleaned out my fridge and was eating up leftovers that don't match.
The Cookie was good.Staff friendly. Place was packed. I won't review for my 2 friends but neither want to go back, ever."}
{"text":"The food is such an interesting mix of Asian and Mexican food. When you walk into the restaurant, it imitates the visuals of a 1950's burger joint, but looks a bit worn-down. 

My only complaint is that the ordering process is one of the most unnecessary annoyances I can imagine. When you place an order, you have to fill out a little slip that lists the plate number, combo, white kind of rice and beans, drink, name, etc. It was completely unnecessary to make customers fill out those slips while the staff behind the register twiddled their thumbs. I personally feel it should be staff's job to get all that info down and not hold up the ordering process when there's a lot of people in the building."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie quesadilla not realizing it would be filled with raw lettuce, which is not what I was expecting. The staff replaced my quesadilla for free, no fuss. Great customer service. And the Jade chicken / cheese quesadilla combo I ended up with was great!  Cookies are awesome too."}
{"text":"Some of the dishes are good but others are better.  This place needs a remodel and more organization.  They have a strange way of ordering your food.  I won't  be back! I have had much better!"}
{"text":"I think the Asian-Mexican fusion is mind-blowing.  Who would have thought you'd get a jade chicken quesadilla?  Sometimes the flavors can be kind of bland, but the Snickerdoodle cookies are to die for. I can't even describe it, you just have to go get one."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an awesome fusion concept of Chinese-Mexican dishes... Mmm Consistently flavorful and delicious food.  I haven't been here in 2 years and the food still tastes as delicious as it did back then. My favorite dish is the 2 entree plate with jerk chicken and jade red chicken with rice and beans.The black beans are out of this world good!  To top off the meal, they give you a homemade snicker doodle cookie. All of this for $7.95... You can't beat this quality meal value anywhere in town."}
{"text":"If you want great, greasy Chex Mex this place is the Taj Mahal! The jerk chicken tacos with fried rice is my all time favorite."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido's website says it serves food that is a blend of Mexican and Asian cooking style. But then what on earth is Jerk Chicken and Jerk Fried rice doing on the menu? Isn't Jerk a cooking style related to something Jamaican? I don't know and I'm not sure. But one thing I can be sure about is whatever your doubts are about CB's cooking style, they will all be laid to rest when you're done eating your Jerk Chicken with Jerk Fried rice and refried Cuban Black Beans served on the side. I've tried a couple other items on the menu and I especially recommend Pollo Diablo if you're looking for something spicy. Oh! And don't forget to eat that Snicker Doodle cookie; it is so delicious."}
{"text":"Was in Arizona for a day on business and had a few hours to kill during lunch. I Googled \"must eat places in Phoenix\" and this place was mentioned amongst others.  It sounded very casual which was what I was looking for. When you think fusion, you normally think foods that are a like. Chinese and Mexican are not two cuisines you think of. Well, it doesn't matter what I think cus they make it work here. From the customer service to the cookie dessert it's a great hole in the wall. Upon entering I didn't know the ordering process. It was a bit of a doozy since you can get your meat in a burrito or quesadilla and they have quite a few selection of meat to choose from. When the server asked if this was my first time, obviously yes since I had a confused look on my face, he asked me if I liked spicy foods and asked if I wanted a sample. I am a human. I eat. I never say no to a sample. He gave me 6 samples. The very last one he however asked if I ate pork.  My first thought was who wouldn't eat such a delicious animal. Then as time passed I realized how considerate he was being. I am Asian and he thought to ask such a question. I thought that was extremely considerate. Anywho, he helped me pick out a great dish and filled my belly. Unfortunately, I never got his name so I can't singly give him praise. But, I know who you are so my belly thanks you for helping me pick out an awesome lunch bowl and being so considerate. 

P.S. - I'd give it an extra star for their mascot, Pancho Panda. What a magnificent beast."}
{"text":"Love it here! I'm so sad they aren't closer anymore! The black beans are dynamite! The jade and jerk chicken are amazing and every bite is packed with flavor!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. My 2 friends and I tried a variety of dishes. I sampled them all. The Chinese was the best. The Mexican was good though the breading on the Chili Relleno was much to thick and covered up the taste of the Chili and the Cheese.
It a great place to take your family when they can't decide on what to eat.
At $7.50 for a combo plate you can't go wrong.
Yes it's an odd combo but it works to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"The food wasn't so good for being Chinese food and i know what great Chinese food taste like."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido has undeniably become one of my favorite restaurants. Back in L.A., they're just now discovering fusion food and it's roaming around the city in lunchtrucks using Twitter to guide their customers. This brick-and-mortar place has been around for 20 years. 

On walking in, we were greeted with, \"Is this your first time? I've got samples for you!\" with a kind worker behind the counter giving us tastings of several of the meats, rice and beans. 

I got a combo with a jerked chicken quesadilla, a pile of the red jade chicken, pork fried rice and refried beans, and I wasn't disappointed with any of it. Jerked chicken was REALLY spicy, but damn good. Outstanding blend of food. It transported well (took it to-go) and tasted just as good the next day after 2 minutes in the microwave. 

And it's so easy to get into the spirit of the place. 

While waiting for our order, these two guys came in and started taking pictures posing with the autographed poster of Guy Fieri and checking out all of the news clippings on the wall. While they discussed what they might want to try, I mentioned that if it's their first time, they can sample the food. Their eyes lit up and they raced to the counter where another nice worker gave them sample cups of everything. One of them excitedly piped up with, \"I'll have whatever Guy had.\" 

Yep, definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at! We've gone here a number of times over the years and it is a must visit when in the Phoenix area!

They have a very unique menu that is half Mexican and Asian-Fusion in my opinion some of the best food combinations have been made this way!

If it's your first visit be sure to hit up the sample area where they will sample you a number of their most popular items it's totally worth it because it will definitely help you on what to order because there is soo many awesome choices it's hard to figure out what ones to get!

They offer combo plates that come with your choice of items. When I visit I must get a Jade Chicken quesadilla it's pretty much orange chicken inside a quesadilla but oh sooo good!

For the rest of my meal I had to get their amazing black beans they are sweet and just all around good! The jerk fried rice was also over the top had a great amount of the jerk flavor with some chicken in it!

For the other half of my meal I ordered a carnitas burrito which was also really good and went very well with the delicious salsa they had up front!

If that weren't enough food they also give you a cookie with your meal generally it will be snicker doodle but on the weekends they do offer another choice on the particular Saturday we were here it was a chocolate fudge cookie! 

We definitely will be back here soon I hope as this is one of the best places you will find in Phoenix and a must bookmark for any Yelper who enjoys good food that's full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Our first time here & wont be our last.The Emerald chicken quesadilla was amazing with the chicken fried rice. The staff & customer service was great."}
{"text":"The food was really good the quality of the meat was kind of Panda Express. The dining room looked like a soup kitchen dining room.  It had very unique flavor and defiantly a must try."}
{"text":"Meh, not sure why everyone is raving, coming from bay area we have great mexican and asian food. Honestly, the food is more of a fad fusion trend than it is quality. 

 One thing I have to say is the service was outstanding, friendly folks. Free rice and drinks for the kids under 10......these are the good things.

The bathroom was disgusting, one of my friends felt sick mid meal and the other threw up/ got the runs a few hours later. These are the bad things...

Really good service, but overall I don't think any of us would want to be repeat customers."}
{"text":"I always love chinos.... one of my favorites. I have been coming here for many years and never displeased."}
{"text":"Really neat place. The Hispanic man that greeted us and explained the menu, was sooo nice and helpful. Got the jade chicken not fried. I'd say to get it fried if you get it. The fried tastes great. The other taste like Bbq sauce on chicken. The egg foo young was great! I got my tortilla on the side and put black beans and the egg foo young inside it. Yummy! Husband says the #1 carnitas was amazing in the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Love it!! Food is wonderful every time and always timely! Highly recommend carnitas, pinto beans, and jade red chicken!"}
{"text":"Love this place. If it wasn't so fattening I would eat here for every meal! 

Love the employees, the atmosphere, place could use some fixing up, but it's very classic very clean and the service it top notch. And the food is incredible. If you like Mexican food or Chinese food you will be satisfied. If you like both, prepare to have your mind blown. Portions are very generous, I never leave hungry, and the free cookie is a nice touch. 

My go-to favorites are Pollo Diablo (in burito form), and Jade red chicken. Don't even get me started about the JFR (jerk fried rice to the newbies). Best thing on the menu. I have a friend who comes from Seattle just to get his wife a quart of JFR before he goes home. I always have to bring a quart home myself cause if I don't, lives are ruined.

If you have never been here before don't be intimidated by their large somewhat complex menu, there is a staff member ready to assist the first timers and provide some samples of their products. (Very nice touch)

Chino bandito is hands down the best comfort food in the valley. my co workers and I come here as often as our waistlines allow :)"}
{"text":"Rice is amazing. Diablo chicken is my favorite. Can be tough and chewy but flavor makes up for it. Ask for a side tortilla. Wish they had sriracha here though...decent prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The unique flavor combinations are amazing. And you get so much food for the price, there is always plenty to take home.

First time I went, they offered up several tasting samples. When I went the second time (and had a big group that nobody else had been too) they did not offer this, which was disappointing since I had talked it up. They should keep that consistent.

5 stars - love it!"}
{"text":"For the kind of food it is, I think it's really good. They give you so much food and you can make it any way you want (quesadilla, rice, etc). Definitely heavy food and I could see it be awesome after a night of heavy drinking. Might be the next best thing to chicken and rice for any East Coasters."}
{"text":"No matter if you want Chinese food or Mexican food, this is a great place to eat! Families are welcome. Food is very good at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really miss this place. I had hoped that reading reviews of it on Yelp would allow me to experience again, if only in my mind, how delicious this (bad for you) food is. It's worth the hype. Haven't found anything like it anywhere since."}
{"text":"I'm going to be real about this, this s*** is amazing. Its f****** amazing. Jade red chicken in a Quesadilla hands down great. You can't go wrong with either beans and all rice variants are good. Get some mother f****** chinos and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. 

Chino Bandido serves up combinations that allow you to mix and match various flavors, wrappings, and sides in a fast food Asian Fusion fashion.

I've been here a few times, and while the food is consistent, it's consistent in the fast-food Asian/Mexican way, like a step up from Panda Express or Filibertos.

I've ordered a few items, my thoughts as follows:

Chinese bbq pork: It wasn't the bright red color I'm used to seeing in typical Chinese bbq style pork, but the pork was tender, and had decent flavor.

Jerk fried rice: Has hints of the \"jerk\" spice seasoning mixed with bits of chicken and veggies. Mildly spicy.

Hengrenade burrito: This burrito was around $3, which is quite cheap. However, it is tiny! It was basically the size of the palm of my hand. The hengrenade chicken itself had a great kick from the spicy sauce, and had a piquant bold flavor.

Emerald chicken: My favorite entree so far, with tender white meat chicken blanketed with a bright green scallion-ginger sauce. It's somewhat reminiscent of Hainanese chicken.

Pollo Diablo: Deep fried chicken coated with a vinegary sauce with peppers. Although this is touted as a super spicy dish, it was more like a mild-medium level to me.

I've eaten in and takee outee'd, and I've always encountered fast and friendly service. 

Overall, good for a fast food fusion fix."}
{"text":"My favorite go to when I'm this way, or just finds my car drifting this direction. I'm not sure what's in the Jade Red Chicken, but I'm fairly certain it isn't legal or you should have to show a license to consume it! I'm addicted! I also love, love the Jen Red Pork. Don't let the \"spicy\" scare you, I'm a wuss and if I can handle it you'll be fine. 
Don't let the ordering process stress you put! They are always willing to help and will let you sample to ensure your happy with your choice. My Betty's are you'll love it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! No need to bore you with the details. Look at the youtube vid for the food network that will tell you all you need to know."}
{"text":"This place is full of evil and grease...pure grease with some cheese and orange sugar...."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a low price point. I would definitely ask for help before ordering because if you have never been there the. You,wouldn't know to grab a order sheet and create what you want before walking up to the register. They allow you to sample the meats if you are unsure of what something is."}
{"text":"As seen on TV, their food is wacky but tasty! Mexican mixed with Chinese, very interesting and a lot of creative food. While this is not a gourmet restaurant, it is worth a try.

Their Chandler location is hard to find, behind Walgreen and you can barely see it from the main streets."}
{"text":"The food is great, totally different than anything you'll get anywhere else. They also will let you taste things when you order if it is your first time. The cookies on the weekend are the best!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Chino Bandido.  I got a chili releno/veggie salad combo.  The chili releno was freshly prepared and the best one I've ever had.  The portion was way bigger than I could eat, though I tried.  It is also a nice treat that they give you a snickerdoodle cookie.  I managed to eat that!  

The staff was super friendly and helpful.  I am a vegetarian and had several very good choices to pick from.  

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great customer service!!!  Small menu selection but there is something for everyone (even a kids selection)"}
{"text":"Since my first visit a couple years ago, I have seen the quality of the food here plummet.  This week, it hit rock bottom.  My wife called in a to go order, picked it up, and brought it home.  We discovered that the small amount of rice they did give us in our combination plates was completely inedible.  It must have been sitting in a warmer for hours because it was hard and crunchy.  My wife ordered the BBQ chicken, and it was hard and dried out.  I ordered the jade red chicken, and it was hard and dried out.  Whoever was working the kitchen had to know the food had been sitting out for too long and was dried out, and it is shameful that they nevertheless served it.  We would have brought it back, but with a newborn at home we did not have the time or energy.  They should have just got it right the first time.

In all, what was once my favorite place in Chandler has slipped to the point that I'm not sure I want to ever go back."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars. This place is unique and has amazing food, I never wait too long for the food to come out, and it's always delicious. 

Unusually get the jade red chicken, pollo diablo in a quesadilla, jerk fried rice and black beans. I then will top it off with their famous sugar cookies."}
{"text":"By far my favorite little hole in the wall in Arizona! When you think of Chinese and Mexican food mixed together, you may doubt it. But please don't! Chino's has nailed it with 5 stars!

Don't be shy to be a newbie at this place, the employees are very friendly! You can also sample the meats if you are unsure on what you want. The prices are great. (last night I spent $35 on dinner for 3 with beers as well)

Did I mention they serve beer?!
Yes that's right. Enjoy this amazing food with a nice cold beer! 

They have tvs so you have something to do while you wait for them to bring the food to your table. It's pretty quick service so you won't wait too long. 
At the end of your meal, don't forget to eat your snicker doodle cookie they give you!

Seriously, come here if you want the best Chinese/Mexican food in town!


*** My Recommendations: 
Jen Ren Pork, Jade Red Chicken, or Emerald Chicken. 
Black refried beans & the chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"Love the emerald chicken and Jade Red. Also love the jerk fried rice. This place has some unique flavors and some great combinations you can think your way through."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we loved it! The person that helped us gave us a bunch of samples so we could find out what we liked. The red chicken quesadilla was amazing. Plus! Free cookies!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the combo. You get two meats and a rice and beans. The rice selection is awesome - try jerk fried rice. For the meats try #10, emerald chicken. For spicy folks, try #13 Diablo chicken. Everyone should also give jerk chicken a try. 

Everything comes with a tasty cookie. 

Very fun dishes... and if it is your first time, you get *free* samples of everything! Seriously great place."}
{"text":"Setting:  It is the racially most funniest place I've been to!  And I mean that in a good way.  The ordering system you'll have to get used to, but even that was rather fun.  The seating area is not restaurant-like...it's more like a hall with rented chairs.  Bathrooms are not-so clean unfortunately.  They have lots of funny stuff for you to look at on the walls.

Food:  Amazing pollo diablo!  Spicy and garlicky, just the way I like it.  Prices are very decent.  They all go in a foil bowl, which doubles as a to-go plate for peeps on the go.

Service:  Awesome folks.  Very helpful.  For rookies like me they were willing to fill out my order form for me.  But I did it anyway...just to see how much I can screw it up.  All in all, good times."}
{"text":"Talk about a funky fix! Asian/Mexican, who woulda thunk it, but it sure works. The jade chicken is the star here. This is not a 5 star dining experience, but who cares. If good, unique food is your wish, this is your answer"}
{"text":"A phoenecian staple for 20 years! I love Chino's but miss the Chandler location.  Great Mexican/Chinese combos.  Jerk Chicken is where its at but cant ignore the machaca quesadilla.  Volcano cookies on Saturdays"}
{"text":"Overrated! Ordered the jade chicken with plain fried rice. Nothing special. I don't plan on eating here again."}
{"text":"I still can't believe how much I enjoyed my meal here. I was a little hesitant to try such a unique concept, but after 5 minutes of entering Chino and being offered a variety of samples, I completely fell in love.  The server was so helpful and friendly, offering a sample of almost everything on the menu.  It is definitely like the Panda Express of Mexican food, but 100x better. 

I ordered the combo with fried rice, black beans, jade chicken and pork carnitas.  Every single bite was delicious and flavorful.  Definitely a must eat when I go back to PHX. 

Oh yeah, the snicker doodle cookies they give you free are chewy gooey goodness."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious. Try the jade red chicken in just about any combination!"}
{"text":"Great food. When they take your order they are very helpful in assisting. Not the most updated place but definately deceiving. The jade red chicken is definately a must try."}
{"text":"LOVE the food!  They also have a Glendale, AZ location (original).  Great blend of chinese and mexican food.  Unique idea!  You can mix n match almost anything....from the rice to veggies/meats to what it's served in (i.e. bowl, quesadilla, burrito, etc)."}
{"text":"BF and I walked into the store looking confused and were immediately greeted and asked if it was our first time there. We were then offered at least 6-7 different samples of the most popular things on the menu. After she saw that we loved all the spicy things she went to the back and grabbed us an additional sample of the pollo diablo.

I got the combo with a jerk chicken quesadilla, pollo diablo, black beans, and white rice. The BF got the emerald chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans. 

We took a seat and got comfortable and was pleasantly surprised when our food came out within 5 minutes. First thing I noticed was how greasy everything was. My quesadilla was dripping oil. My jerk chicken quesadilla was ok, the seasoning on the chicken was lost and it just tasted like a regular quesadilla. My BFs emerald chicken quesadilla was SO good though (even with the dripping grease) the green onion and ginger made it very refreshing. I loved the slight sweetness of the black beans and the seasoning on my diablo chicken.

Portions were just ok for the price we paid $17 for the two combos. I'm saying this because my bf finished his portion without any problems and I purposefully saved some for breakfast the next day. We can normally share a meal from panda. 


P.S. Everything was even better the next day!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in AZ. A great place for a variety of styles of food. Nothing else like it."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! It's right down the street from my house, the staff is rad, and the food is spot on. It's in a weird strip mall, so I was weary at first, but it's nice and clean inside, and well organized. The girl who took my order was so sweet, and the young man who was training her on the computer system was so patient and kind while teaching her. So stoked I gave this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Always the best food! Live the place and all the combos you can come up with. Truly good and those cookies too. Yummy hot and love the salad too."}
{"text":"Very interesting. I liked that they let you sample the meat before you bought it. I got a 2 choice plate with Jade Red chicken and the veggie quesadilla with white rice and black beans. My favorite was the chicken and rice. There's just something not very tasty about broccoli with lettuce and tomatoes and cheese in a quesadilla, thought it was worth a try, but that experience will not be re-lived. The beans were mashed and had a Cuban seasoning, which wasn't awful but I think you just have to have a taste for it. Overall, not my cup of tea, I wouldn't mind stopping by for a quick bite if I was in the area and whoever I was with wanted something interesting for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Mexican + Chinese fusion...but not really in my opinion. The only thing they add that's Mexican are the beans. 

The jade chicken is good, but I was not a fan of the jerk chicken. It's really spicy and the flavor is just ok. You can get a meal with fried rice & beans. I wasn't a fan of the black beans. It was like a paste. 

There is a dining area, but it's pretty ghetto. But I did appreciate the TV that was in the dining area."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and absolutely LOVE everything on the menu! It's a mix of Mexican and Chinese dishes that the owners combined together to offer amazing dishes. All the dishes can be ordered in a bowl, tortilla (burrito), or quesadilla and offer rice and beans on the side. My personal favorites are their \"jade red chicken\" and the \"jerk chicken\"  with a side of black beans and \"jerk fried rice\" this place is a MUST TRY and I regularly stop in"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the red chicken& hengrenade with rice.  They let you try a little to be sure. Hengrenade was nice; but I wish I had gotten double red chicken, it was that good I want more!

Plus, it was a nice touch to get a cookie with my meal!"}
{"text":"They are no longer in Chandler (FYI).

I think this location makes more sense as the white suburban, franchise loving, people of the south Valley could never appreciate a place like this.

A class DDD, Chino Bandido offers a great blend of Asian and Mexican influences. I recommend the diablo chicken with jerk fried rice, but you can mix and match several options. Besides the novelty of the place, the food is really delicious with that \"greasy spoon\" flavor. I am sure nothing here is healthy, but it is certainly worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Been going to both locations for around 6 years off and on.  What can I say..unique Arizona place.  The unique ordering system takes a bit of effort to master, but it does work.   My favorites include the jerk chicken (which I order w/ jerk fried rice), the jade chicken,  the emerald chicken, the hengrenade chicken and the quesadillas.   A unique place w/ a unique menu that is always worth the drive."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. We came because we heard about it on Triple D and so wanted it to be good. We got two bowls, one with Chile Relleno / Jade Chicken and one with Jade Chicken / Jerk Chicken. The food came out really fast and was not especially hot and certainly not freshly cooked. Tasted like it had been sitting in warming trays for quite some time. The chicken was also tough. Flavors not outstanding either, even if it had been fresh. Glad we tried it but won't be back."}
{"text":"The place is really chill and low key type of environment. The combination of asian and Mexican food is great! The order menu can be hard to figure out if its your first time there. The food overall was good and had a home cooked taste too it."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona last week for business & wanted to go here because I saw them on TV. As soon as I walked in they let me try samples & explained how everything works. Food was ok however, The four stars are for the service & staff! I will be back to try new things! Get the cookies!

PS. The place was dirty"}
{"text":"Stomach's beware!  Amazing food and great service, but a hole in the wall location. YELP helped me find this spot and the Red Jade Chicken was awesome. The Hangrenade Chicken was the best I have ever had. Wonderful flavors!  Definitely recommend for lunch. It was a good mix of business and casual patrons, but totally worth the $9.50 for lunch!  

Menu is a bit confusing, but they give samples to help make a decision. Good mix of caribbean, Mexican, and Chinese food!

Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite restaurant. I've been going here since I was young. The food is a crazy combination of Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean. It may not look like much and you may miss it if you just drive by but the food is to die for. My favorite dish has to be the Jade Red Chicken or a Veggie Quesadilla. I love finishing off the meal with their Snickerdoodles!"}
{"text":"A sort of mystery I've heard about but had never experienced, my boyfriend proposed that we go here with his parents a few nights ago. It's tucked in the pack of a shopping center, and we were surprised at how big it is inside. The ladies behind the counter were very nice, and after learning we had never been there before, we got to taste 6 of their most popular menu items. After tasting them, I decided on a combo with regular refried beans, plain fried rice, jade red chicken, and a jerk chicken quesadilla. We took a seat at one of the GIANT tables they have and patiently waited before our food was brought out to us. 

Once our food came out, we quickly dug in. I really liked the flavor of the jade red chicken, and I didn't want to taint it by putting it in a burrito or quesadilla, but it stands up just on its' own. Being Jamaican, I liked the jerk chicken, it could have been more flavorful but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican so I won't fault them there. It made a pretty tasty quesadilla though. Something about the rice and beans didn't rock my world, it has a sweet aftertaste which I'm not really a fan of. Maybe it was just the batch? 

Anyways, I could barely finish half of it, and saved the rest for later. The cookie was a nice treat. I'll definitely be back and will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Ok, so I kind of perversely enjoy a restaurant that's so needlessly complicated that it requires its own help desk, but that was before I tried the food. We went through the newbie tour, getting little bites of everything, and were mostly underwhelmed. Striking out nonetheless, I ordered the jade chicken, fried rice, and the pork in a quesadilla. I was impressed by the tender and flavorful pork, but that's where the magic ended. I felt everything was awash in salt, and the jade chicken was as generic as Asian food comes. The snickerdoodle was cute, but a fun concept does not a good restaurant make. Guy Fieri, I expected better of you."}
{"text":"My boss took me since I am new to Phoenix, and I have brought people since. 
When I'm in the area, I will definitely stop in for their unique style food. 
Love it here!"}
{"text":"I liked that you can sample various items before ordering.  Loved the dish I ordered, but now have to go back again to order the rest!"}
{"text":"Love the Jade Red Chicken.  The Chinese Mexican food fusion is unique and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years. Even though I no longer live in Phoenix, I always make it a point to visit when I get out. Unique and tasty menu."}
{"text":"I love Mexican Food and Chinese Food and who would've thought... together? 

The place looks like a taco shop in the ghetto but who cares. The panda is wearing a sombrero and has a mustache and is holding a bowl of rice. The lady lets you sample some of the favorites which is unique because most restaurants you're stuck with guessing. 

I ordered a jade chicken quesadilla and ginger chicken with rice and beans. The food is amazing and whoever thought of this idea is genius. They give you a cookie with their order but my friend ordered \"snickerdoodle\" because it sounds funny. It was a cinnamon cookie.  

And their on the wall it says \"The Great Wall of Chino.\" Someday I'll be on that wall :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chino for over 10 years and it is still probably my favorite place on earth. In all that time, neither myself or anyone else I know has had any issues (while eating or after). I have taken many a friend to Chino's for the first time and their lives have never been the same (in a good way, of course). The place is a dive but it's not gross by any means and they'll let you sample anything on the menu.

The jade red chicken is the most popular item and for good reason but try it in a quesadilla and it'll blow your mind (no really, try it- the owner himself was the one who turned me onto this and I will never go back). The black beans...so good I could eat them all day (but don't, unfortunately). I usually get hengrenade chicken as my second item and stick with white rice for mixing with my chicken and beans but the chile relleno and jerk fried rice are also fabulous. And a free (giant delicious) cookie for dessert...um yes please; the Snickerdoodles are classic but my one true love is the Volcano cookie. 

Love the Mexican panda, love the plastic chairs, LOVE THE FOOD. Chino really is the best so don't let anyone tell you otherwise."}
{"text":"Great food ,nice people, everyone's pretty happy. Food does take a bit to long to come out of the kitchen not a big deal. The snicker doodle cookies are off the chain"}
{"text":"I wish the food I order everytime I come here wasn't soooooo darn good so I can try everything else! 
Hangover bliss!or (munchie paradise) Never disappointed!
 3 years going strong! Jade red chicken, pollo Diablo quesadilla, and pork fried rice everytime! 
Hits all the notes! Spicy,sweet,savory, and packed with flavor! 
The place looks like a hole in the wall....with a crowd out the door! Give Chino a try!!!! Mucho awesome!!!

You get a cookie with every meal! What more do you need!?"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing great things about it, and it lived up to the hype! Apart from the fact that the ordering menu was a bit confusing and it may have been on the pricier side, the food was amazing and the portions were very big! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"You won't find anything like it! My favorite is the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. The cheese pairs amazingly with the spicy chicken. I never would have imagined that Chinese and Mexican food would go together so well, but Chino Bandito does it seamlessly. Go on Sundays for Volcano Cookies and tostadas."}
{"text":"It took me 2 years to finally get here....but I did it!
Living 40 mins away was a problem, too.
But im moving in October...and ill only be 5 mins away!
Oh yeah!!!!
I don't even know what to say.
IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by the flavors AND service here. Had the red jade chicken, emerald chicken quesadilla and jerk fried rice... Couldn't be happier.

This is \"eat through the pain\" food. Which is the highest compliment I can personally give an establishment. Even when I realized I should really stop eating - I just couldn't. 

So, so, so good. Will be back VERY soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was unsure when I first saw the place--I mean, from the outside it doesn't look like anything special.  Going in didn't change that impression.  And Asian Mexican fusion? But one bite of the jade red chicken and cuban beans and I was hooked.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is cafeteria type but  the food and  the snickerdoodles more then compensate for that.  It's all good."}
{"text":"Very nice service. They give u 6 samples to try for the first time"}
{"text":"Wonderfully thought of concept of melding Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  They work so well to balance each other's flavors harmoniously.  

Have your doubts? Yes, my good friend, Guy Fierri will back me up.  He has yet to fail me and my mission for great cuisine, upscale but slumming it!

1) Walk in, taste food. Lady at the counter is very helpful with explaining the descriptions of every taste sample.  
2) Make selections.  She will help you fill the puzzle-like order form
3) Find seat.  Make sure you listen for your name, as they will walk your order to you and holler your name, sometimes not loud enough
4) Eat, enjoy, exhale.  

Favorites, as me and dining companion had duplicate orders with the exception that I had the machaca in a quesadilla, they had it in a burrito.   Machaca quesadilla won by popular vote...was convinced to share half of mine!  

Emerald chicken had nice gingery flare.  This seemed exceptionally healthy, as it seemed to be stir fried with the seasonings, and meat was made with chicken breast, and not thighs.  Jerk chicken was good, but not \"jerked\" enough...I was expecting more heat to it. Volcano cookie, soft center, chewy crust.  Yum! 

Knocking off a star because it was hard to find a clean table to sit at.  I could care less if a place is a mom and pop's place, but c'mon...Wiping off a table ain't too hard! Décor was cute.... Mexican panda bear themed."}
{"text":"Yummy fusion!! The jade chicken is the very best! The refrained black beans were delicious and fresh. Wash it down with an ice cold Tsingtao."}
{"text":"If you don't know Mexican or Chinese food, then you'll probably like this place. If taco bell and panda express are awesome in your eyes, then this is the place for you! lol I've been here twice and not by choice. (Trying to be open minded and a team player) Each time I tried something different and both times I felt like I wasted my money. The rice is very dry as if it was sitting out all day and night. Lacks flavor. The beans are straight out of a can. Nothing I've tried tasted fresh or authentic. Never again, even if it was free. Very sad."}
{"text":"There are some problems with this place.  They don't include the service which is superb.  The menu is weird, but not too difficult.  The food is a different story.  It's good, but I don't get all the hype.  The chili relleno really sucks!  Super thick cracker crumbs, no sauce, thick yellow cheese, (not completely melted.....two times!!!) and non-roasted chili make for an atrocious relleno!! The Diablo Chicken...good...if you like butt loads of garlic. (Which I do) I haven't found the perfect combo yet.  I'll keep working on it, but don't expect to be blown away, and if you get the relleno after reading this...shame on you...bad foodie.  Don't do it... 
To end on a positive note....service is outstanding.  Very friendly staff.  You can sample stuff...do it!  I'm giving an extra star due to the service.  Lot's of potential here."}
{"text":"The service there is still just pretty bad.  I came back for the first time since April this year. Had a to go order.  Phone was answered by someone who calls themselves panther.  Huh?  Seriously? Ok, panther, your phone service was ok, not really that friendly but you got the job done.  Panther, really?  Food portions were lighter than usual but still tasty.   Dining room had a lot of people in it, and a lot of tables that were really dirty.  Also, the swinging door to the bathroom does not fit, there is a half inch space or more around the entire door that people who are sitting right outside the door can see through, hear through or, uh...smell through....I love the food.  But the experience keeps going downhill for me.  Nothing has changed in 9 months.  And you let someone answer the phone who calls themselves Panther.  That is really just too weird for me.

Good Luck, time for me to move on to some place that pays attention to their little details."}
{"text":"I am all about my food being flavorful and plentiful, this place did not disappoint!

Every single bite was flavor party in my mouth. Jamaican, Chinese and Mexican food fused together with just the right amount of spice, how amazing!

If you are in within a 30 minute drive this place is a must!"}
{"text":"FL4VR XPL0D.!!!!1!!!! 

I've been to Chino Bandido several times, but it's been close to 3 years since my last trip... The last few times I had been there were rather unremarkable, but Chino got hur groove back it seems. The portions were huge, the flavors were super intense, and the cheese was served by the pound. Having gone with my mom, dad, and neighbors, it seems that junk food loving guys, like myself, prefer Chino Bandido... it's fried, cheesy, gooey, and greasy... which I adore, but that's not for everyone. The Pork Fried Rice could be the best fried rice I've ever had,... 
All sorts of yum for less than $10 per person, and it's served with a snickerdoodle after! woooo!"}
{"text":"Jade red chicken- you alone make me want to come back to Phoenix. Cool mix of the Caribbean, Mexican, and Chinese food. Amazing prices and they let you sample everything before you order!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great. But tonight they messed up my take out order. I went to replace it and they were very nice about it. However they only replaced the one item that they messed up. So by the time I went back to the restaurant and waited for my new burrito then drove home, all the rest of my food was cold. Nice try and I commend them for being so nice but the cold food really ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I loved this place once upon a time. It was cleaner, bigger and friendlier than it's northern parent. Been coming here for years and in the past had rated it at 5 stars. 

The last few times though, it's dirtier. The staff appears to be immature high kids. The service is much worse with every trip having some kind of service failure. 

Tonight I came for my birthday. At an hour before closing half the tables are covered in chairs and the place reeks of bleach. The prices are raised, but that has to happen sometimes. When our food is served it's wrong. Replacement food takes about :20 to get to us, after many patrons that arrived after the concern was raised got served and a reminder. My burrito was torn, and my quesadilla looked like a cat with a seizure prepared it. The only reason I could eat them is because they were almost completely empty. 

So... in short I'm not going back. I understand raising prices, but not while simultaneously subtracting service and potion size. Bye panda, I'll miss who you were when I first met you."}
{"text":"A great fusion of Americanized Chinese cuisine with Mexican style."}
{"text":"For my 100th review and first one in 2015, I knew it was finally time to review Chinos. If there is one place I have to take my friends and family who visit from out of town, it is Chino Bandido. 

There are quite a number of entree options that can be paired with rice, beans or both! My favorite is the combination plate with jade red chicken (get this), emerald chicken (get this too), with white rice and black beans (you MUST get this). If white rice doesn't appeal to you, get the jerk fried rice! It's a spicy concoction that is a favorite amongst my friends. You can also get any of the entree items in a quesadilla or burrito. The carnitas quesadilla is bomb. When you are stuffed like a turkey, wash everything down with a FREE snickerdoodle. SWEET. Sometimes on the weekends, you can get a chocolate lava cookie. EVEN SWEETER.

Overall, I love Chino. Yes it is a little sketch looking on the outside and it does have that hole-in-the-wall feel, but it is DELICIOUS and well worth it. Could it be a little nicer? Probably, but that takes away from the experience. It has been PACKED every time I've gone which speaks to how good the food is.  Initially, I wondered if this fusion would go together: Mexican and Chinese, would that even work?! But it does, and it works beautifully."}
{"text":"As much as the interior set up of the place resembles the community tables one might find in prison, or so I'm told, the food is fantastic and the shower rape almost never happens, at least during lunch hours.

Depending on the crowd, or lack thereof, you might have to fill out a little form with codes for the different dishes. Sure, it sounds like passing messages in a North Vietnamese prison camp, or so I'm told, but the staff will always patiently help you to choose whatever you want, before you are tortured for information on troop movements.

The combos are the real treat and the Jade Red Chicken as a quesadilla and the roast pork as a burrito are the best! Yes, it's Chinese food wrapped in quesadillas or burritos and the Snickerdoodle cookie you get with your meal caps it all off better than a dock strike clearing out the scab workers and importing more prostitutes, or so I'm told.

I can never eat a whole combo, or so I'm told, so having a second meal makes this a real bargain as well as delicious."}
{"text":"Takee-Outee...they say...i guess that's how asians say take out?! 

Aside from the half racism associated with this place, the food, service, and theme were 5 yelp stars worthy. 

I had my reservations about coming to this place, but my friend suggested we come here during our Glendale trip (yes we took a road trip from Glendale to Glendale...how cool are we?!) because he had heard about this place from Diners Driveins and Dives show on Food Network. I like that show and I expected good food with large quantities...because that's what I think of when I remember that show. So we got into the place which is a very not pretentious looking restaurant. It had a decent sized eating area with cafeteria style tables and chairs and a large ordering area with pictures and two different counters so that you can sample the different dishes. A lot of Pandas in some kind of guerilla gear with bullets, grenade guns, and everything. 

When I saw the menu, I already knew what I wanted...something super Chinese food like, and something super Mexican food like...I got their Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas. I got them plain, but you could put any of their items into a quesadilla or a burrito. Because we went with a large group, I got to try their Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken, and their Machaca in different burrito and quesadilla styles. 

Placed my order and got my food with pork fried rice and beans inside some huge pie tin...i guess these hold about 2 pounds worth of food. Everything was really good...Jade Red Chicken...i think i could eat this every time I make my way out to the greater Phoenix area...it is like Panda's orange chicken, but less greasy feeling and doesn't have a chicken flavor...i guess the comparison comes with the texture. The carnitas was just like I would expect at any Mexican food places in the greater LA area, which was good. Moist, chewy, all that. the Emerald chicken was also good because of its salty thing that comes with it. OH! and another great thing about this place...I got to wash down the meal with fountain Diet Dr. Pepper!!!!! 

Hard to find that here in LA, just as surprising as when I went to a place with Coke Zero or Orange Bang offered as fountain drinks...ended up taking a picture with their mascot....cuz i'm a panda too."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido, you robbed me of a good lunch!

This place came highly recommended by some of my peers before I moved down here. The concept is very cool, but I think the execution just isn't there. The idea of combining Mexican and Chinese foods intrigued me, but when my food arrived, it came in a aluminum to go container, looking like food I hadn't finished from the night before that I reheated. It was also unceremoniously  dropped off in front of us, they seemed it bit unorganized. 

As for the taste, I give it a big Meh. Not bad, not good. The fried rice wasn't very good, but the gringo chicken was tasty. The carnitas was a bit too shredded, it lacked texture and was similar to ground pork. I might think about giving it another shot,  but my coworkers have deemed this place \"Off the list...\""}
{"text":"This place had me excited when I first went here. Chinese food and Mexican food together?! Heck yes! However, I was sorely disappointed when I tried their place out. First off, the place looked dirty. With the floor looking somewhat damaged and the brown stains it was a large turn off. The dish I got was decently good, maybe a bit salty. It was what came after. I suffered from about a week of food poisoning. I thought that maybe the food poisoning did not originate from here so I gave the place another try a few months later with a date. Not only did I get food poisoning again, but both my date and I agreed not to go back to the place for the food was tasteless except for the excess salt. 

The reason I give this place two stars instead of one is due to the fact the staff here are very kind, and the system in which they allow you to sample a dish before eating it it is a brilliant idea that many places do not adhere to."}
{"text":"We visited last week.  The lady offered us a lot of samples of their food so we could pick out what we liked.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  The restaurant was very kid friendly."}
{"text":"First came to this place awhile back prior to their entrées being similar to combos. I liked their Jerk chicken and fried rice and their red jade chicken. I went back here recently and still enjoyed their jade chicken with steamed rice- it's a bit of a rich dish as far as flavor and sauce goes, but it's quite good. 

I tried a little bit of my hubby's machaca quesadilla, and it was also quite good. I'd definitely come back to this place. The prices aren't too bad and there's a decent amount of things to choose from."}
{"text":"This has got to be the craziest idea I've ever heard of but it works!!! Decided to take the drive north to try this place and it was delicious! I had the pollo Diablo, jade red chicken, refried beans and jerk chicken fried rice. My boyfriend had the Chinese bbq pork, jade red chicken, refried beans and jerk chicken fried rice. All good and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, and I must say it exceeded my expectations by far. 
Great food, even better service! 
The person taking our order was more than helpful and gave us plenty of samples.
I chose a two entree combination plate and picked the Red jade chicken quesadilla, gringo chicken and jerk fried rice plus Volcano cookie. Let's just say the plate looked brand new when I was done.  Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Hit this place today with a couple of colleagues for lunch. Definitely a lot of hype going into it, and I'm always afraid I'll be underwhelmed when that's the case, but for the second time this week, I was actually presently surprised by yet another hole-in-the-wall that lived up to its reputation. 

First off, this place gets busy in a hurry, so you'd do well to beat the lunch crowd if at all possible. In our case, we walked in around 11:30 and were barely able to get a table for ourselves in the far corner of the back room. The parking lot was packed to the brim when we left too, so if you plan to dine in, go early or expect to hunt for a spot and wait in line. 

The ordering process here is a bit confusing, as others have noted, but we lucked out and had a very helpful (and super patient!) lady guide us through the process and write up the slips for us. Not sure if that's the norm, but that is some of the best customer service I've ever gotten when I've been new to a place and not sure of what I wanted to try (or in this case, how to order it). I don't know if that's the process now or what, but we would have surely been lost without someone to show us the ropes. Honestly, it's not a process the customers should have to do themselves and I can see where the frustration was coming from. With help it's easy to figure out how it works, the difference between the regular and combo and all the options, but to the uninitiated, it is definitely intimidating. 

That's not to say it isn't rewarding once you have it down. There are tons of combinations and a slew of add on items, upgrades on the rice (chicken or beef fried, for example) and the option to have something thrown into a quesadilla instead of plopped on the plate. You definitely won't struggle to find something new to try here, because there is an insane number of potential combinations. Once you figure out what's going down, you get your ticket, take it to the other section of the counter and pay up, then they find you (by calling your name) and bring it out to your table when it's ready. Pretty easy once you get past the ordering part!

In our case, we tried the carnitas and the BBQ pork, and they were both excellent. Lots of flavor and paired well with chicken fried rice and their delicious black beans. They had awesome flavor and were some of the best refried beans I've ever had. Drinks were just regular soft drinks and self serve, which is actually something I prefer since you can top up whenever you need it. The food itself came out pretty quickly, even though they were already busy, and everything was exactly as specified. Considering the complexity of some of this stuff and the ordering process, I have to give them props for having it down to a science. 

I will concede to a few points made by other reviewers regarding the cleanliness of the place, but to their credit, with the amount of folks coming in and out, it's not easy to get to the tables before someone else snaps up an open spot. You can see how this leads to a build up before it gets cleaned again. I did see folks doing their best to catch the open spots when there was time, and the soft drink areas was being regularly kept up and cleaned while we were there too. 

The place is a divey, hole-in-the-wall operation, but it must be said that they do it well. I don't think it would have the same ambiance if it were anything else, to be honest, it's probably one of those places you either love or hate. That said, I'm firmly in the former camp and definitely plan to go back sometime soon. There's a steep learning curve to ordering your food, but if you go with someone that knows the ropes or get their before they're too busy, you'll probably have all the time and help that you need."}

{"text":"Best Mexican/Chinese fusion in the valley! Been enjoying food here for 17 years and have never been disappointed. Plus you get a free sugar cookie with your meal and they are delicious! Check it out.... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm really not mad about this but the hubby loves it!  I will say that the leftovers from an orange chicken quesadilla were pretty yummy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a dive Chinese and Mexican restaurant. When you go inside you place your order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The person will give you samples of some of the Chinese dishes.

I wasn't particularly impressed, but the friend I went with loved her food.  She got two Chinese dishes (with rice and refried beans).  I got a tostada which is only offered on Saturdays and Sundays.  It was small, but the lady told me it would be small.  I also got a quesadilla which was a flour tortilla folded in half with melted cheese, lettuce and tomato inside.  Since it was folded in half, it was cut into two pie shaped pieces.  It was OK, but the lettuce made it soggy.  I chose not to get beans or rice.

It's very casual--food is served in an aluminum container with plastic knives and forks.  If you want to take your leftovers home, they have the cardboard that serves as a cover.

This isn't a place I would go back to.  It WAS, however, featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and there's a picture of Guy as soon as you walk into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very very good and delicious food. Must try the jade chicken in any form, plain, burrito, or quesadilla. If you've never been here, ask for help when ordering, just wish the employee helping me would have. Even a little bit nicer and not treated me like an idiot for not knowing how to order. But I definitely will be returning here!"}
{"text":"I forgot about this place for a long time because I was buying my quick Asian food elsewhere but elsewhere closed and after paying for a sit down dinner at a Asian restaurant plus tip recently - I decided it was time to return to Chino.  I ordered the pork fried rice and egg fu yung bowl.  Old school chinese with vegies.  My biggest complaint about fast Asian food and buffets are that they are all about bland meat with very little vegies but Chino did not disappoint me and they were super fast.  I will be returning to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I went Sunday night and the portions were very small like 3 table spoons of refried beans small. The beans were so cold the cheese didnt melt and the chilie relliano was a chile coated in Saltine Crackers I guess thats their style (so gross) also I did not receive my quesadilla."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant feeling dubious.  My mother wanted to eat here, but my husband and I were hesitant as we are vegetarians.  We chose to go ahead and appease her.  We went to the counter and asked the employee what vegetarian options were available.  Not only did he explain all our options, he let us taste everything first.  My husband and I decided to get a chili relleno quesadilla, which was one of the most amazing things I have ever had to eat.  We also got Cuban black bean tostadas and a veggie quesadilla.  The Cuban black beans were out of this world delicious, and the veggie quesadilla was pleasant enough.  Both were served with this amazing ginger cilantro sauce.  It had a weird smell but the flavor was out of this world.  The salsa was also good.  We also got an egg foo yung burrito which was not that great.  But the chili relleno quesadilla was so amazing it made up for the not so good burrito.  In addition, for dessert we got some out of this world cookies.  I had my husband go up to order more chili relleno quesadillas (let me just add that never in my life have I ever enjoyed chili relleno, so this has to say just how fantastic they are that I would want more) but unfortunately they had just run out of chili's.  To make up for it, the nice employee gave us more cookies to take with us!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  It was delicious and I can't wait for my next trip to Phoenix to eat there again."}
{"text":"Dont let the exterior fool you, you will be glad you came in the door, if your a first trimmer let them know and you can sample some of their best sellers.  This place is one of a kind. Very friendly and helpful staff. The food is incredibly delicious. My favorite is the jade red chicken and teriyaki chicken with refried beens and white rice."}
{"text":"Sometimes the Triple D (Diners, Drive ins, and Dives) will lead you astray.  Many times the taste of the food, doesn't live up to how wonderful it looks.  However I'm happy to report that Chino Bandido is as advertised.  The Asian/ Mexican fusion concept has been in full effect in Southern California for a while, so that alone wasn't going to win me over.

What did win me over right away was how happy they were let us try several things when they saw us staring at their menu.  I had a good idea what I was getting before hand, but next thing I know I was being handed little tasting cups of their jade red chicken, jerk chicken, carnitas, and who knows what else.  The well priced combination bowls are the way to go here so you can try many things.  No extra charge to turn something into a quesadilla or burrito if you want.  A combination gets you 2 main dishes, rice, and beans, so a couple of those and my wife and I got to sample several things.

We went with the jade red chicken quesadilla, jerk chicken, emerald chicken, chile relleno, pork fried rice, jerk chicken fried rice, and black beans.  Wow what a feast!  The portions here are very generous.  Everyone talks about how amazing the jade red chicken is, so I had high expectations.  When we were given our free sample of it, I knew it wasn't my thing.  They described it as their \"orange chicken\".  I don't like orange chicken either, so that explains it.  It's breaded and sweet and I totally get why so many people like it, so I'm going to write this off as a \"just me\" thing.  After tasting it, I thought lets try it in a quesadilla because I'm not that into it.  The quesadilla was grilled nicely and had plenty of cheese.  Cheese makes everything better and I was surprised that this didn't get too soggy considering the sticky chicken inside.  I guess I had some kind of spicy red curry chicken in mind when hearing about jade red chicken.  Oh well - if you have a sweet tooth, then you will love this stuff (as many do).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chino-bandido-phoenix-3?select=CZvfsuGP_dza-9TYOodNeQ#rkVsRNwilZcerkygrk7gUA

The jerk chicken was mostly sliced white meat with a nice jerk spice dry rub on it.  It had a kick, but wasn't too strong.  The emerald chicken was perhaps the most interesting of the meats.  Actually I couldn't taste much of the actual chicken because all of the flavor is in the emerald sauce.  The chicken, once again was sliced white meat and skinless.  The emerald sauce is what I would call an Asian pico de gallo with  chopped up ginger and green onion being the main flavors.  It really works and is very refreshing and light.  I would say if you are trying to eat healthy, the emerald chicken and plain white rice bowl would be an excellent choice.  But this also might be interesting in a not so healthy burrito as well, as I didn't seem to mind the emerald sauce mixing with any of the other flavors on the plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chino-bandido-phoenix-3?select=CZvfsuGP_dza-9TYOodNeQ#oIWS6IwY0EDA_OnjwnAnbw

The Chile Relleno is all about the crust here.  Oh how I wish it were filled with a better quality cheese than your standard Mexican - cheddar/ jack mix.  Not that they are the first to use the plain stuff, but a queso blanco like oaxaca would have really made this a 5 star Chile Relleno.  This is one large poblano pepper and I'm not sure how they prepared it.  I'm guessing it is first quickly deep fried in egg batter, then rolled in crushed ritz crackers, brushed with butter then baked.  This is purely a guess and seems like a lot of work, but I couldn't really explain what I was tasting here.  However they do it, the result is a crunchy buttery flakey cracker crust on this pepper, and I'm a big fan.

Chino Bandido has a nice selection of rice for your combo.  We went with the jerk chicken fried rice because that seemed the most interesting, as well as the more traditional pork fried rice.  You know what?  Even though the jerk chicken fried rice was good, you just can't beat pork.  Pork will always win.  It's a magic food and once again the pig proved to me why it was put on this earth.  A true gift of the culinary gods.  

I also enjoyed the black beans, that were prepared more like refried beans and topped with melted cheese.  It was kind of on the sticky side with plenty of seasoning added.  Seems to me, while they are fusioning the Asian and Mexican flavors here, with the jerk chicken and black beans, you can add the Caribbean into the mix as well.  Our meal ended with a complimentary fresh baked cookie (we chose 1 snicker doodle and 1 chocolate) with a chewy center to them, these were pretty good.  I can see why Chino Bandido is popular with the locals, with plenty of options to try at a very affordable price. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chino-bandido-phoenix-3?select=CZvfsuGP_dza-9TYOodNeQ#YGQIUUDXXMh1CUc1MSolVQ"}
{"text":"I love Chino's. You need to test a few things out, but once you find your combination you'll be hooked. My combination is the hengernage quesadilla and jerk fried rice. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a weird concept that totally works. Give them a try your stomach will thank you for it."}
{"text":"After doing the math, it turns out I've been coming to Chino's for 16 years, but until yesterday I could never put my finger on why I love it so.  Chino's appeals to me, and likewise turns many off, because they know exactly what their flaws are and proudly display those flaws front and center without shame.  They have no intention of conforming to the industry's idea of what a \"good\" restaurant is supposed to look like.  Their loyal following is ok with that.

Instead, going to Chino's is a lot like visiting your great-grandma that's lived in the same house forever in a now run down neighborhood.  You know you'll always be greeted with a big, warm, bosomy hug immediately followed by gut busting cooking that may not be Cordon Bleu-worthy but is filled with enough love to make up for it.  Chino's staff and all their customers are some of the nicest people to ever gather in a restaurant, and embrace every new customer as one of their own.  The customers are all so happy to be there they almost look giddy.  And like great-grandma's house, the place is filled with stories - of the original owners, how it got its name, celebrities and local titans of industry who ate there - as evidenced by the hundreds of pictures and memorabilia around the place.  If you're ever feeling lonely, go to Chino's during lunchtime.  You won't feel lonely long.

Guy Fieri's the best, but sometimes I wish he hadn't visited Chino's.  It's really not his kind of place and that gave people incorrect expectations.  Chino's would have been better represented by Anthony Bourdain.  It's his kind of food.

I'll leave with some random thoughts to help you decide whether you're a good candidate for a Chino's visit, and to make the most of it:

The full name is \"Chino Bandido Takee-Outee\".  It is meant to be a take-out joint.  They added a very basic dining area as a courtesy, but if that's not good enough for you for goodness sake get your food to-go and take it to North Mountain Park or something.

They call it mexican/chinese fusion food, but it isn't IMHO.  It's uniquely their own style with recipes developed by the chinese girl that bandit stole.  Go in only if you can throw out your preconceived ideas about either cuisine.

The food is perfect in its imperfections.  You don't want to know the nutritional content.  Really.  Even the many non-meat items.  So when you try those samples, throw the diet out the door and get what tastes best to you.  The meal will make itself known long after you're done, and you will without question need a nap afterward.  And the same dish won't taste quite the same next time you come in as it does today; or the time after that.  Depends who's cooking and what's going on in their life that day, I think, but there's never been a time I didn't love it anyway.  

This is food meant to be played with.  Anything can be made into a quesadilla or rice bowl or burrito or whatever.  Can be a problem for the indecisive type, so ask one of the heavy set guys sporting a polo shirt and corporate i.d. badge what you should order.  He won't steer you wrong.

Now if all this stuff doesn't sound absolutely amazing to you, please don't go to Chino's.  I really don't want to read your whiney-a&^ review after I've gone to all this trouble for you.  If it does sound amazing...well, prepare to be embraced into the bosom of Chino's!"}
{"text":"I've been a Chino junkie the past couple weeks.  It's so good!  I love their veggie quesadilla... and you get a big, soft Snickerdoodle with your meal too.

This place isn't much to look at, but it's clean and well maintained.  Go experience the Mexican/Chinese fusion for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome find!
Amazing food, friendly service and large potions. I will be definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a friend. Ive been to the Chandler location before so I was pretty stoked to find a Chinos near here.

Dont expect anything fancy. Really. The place is filthy. And thats being nice. But the food, is really good. Not amazing, but foe the price and how fast it is, it really is good. 

You get your choice of having your food burrito, or quesadilla style, or traditional (in a \"bowl\"). I usually choose the bowl type deal, Im weird and like seeing the colors/grains of the food Im eating. 

Their jade red chicken is crazy awesome. Same with the BBQ Chinese Pork. You cant really go wrong. But I would study what you want before coming. Cause their line builds up pretty quickly.

The place is pretty big. You order your food in one part of the place, then walk over to a good sized room to eat. Its like a cafeteria really. They hand you a written ticket, you give that ticket to someone else and pay and get your drink. 

And it helps its also a Pokestop. My only complaint is the windows. I feel like Im an animal at the zoo. The windows are huge and theres no blinds/curtains. And the windows face a parking lot. So people can be chilling in their cars and watch you stuff your face full of food."}
{"text":"Always good, and a great idea when you want something a little different.  Eating in is ok but the dining area is no frills, a little less than no frills.

We have been several times now, mostly we get take out which is fairly quick and easy. 

Do this, Jen Red Chicken and Jade Red Pork with either chicken fried rice or pork fried rice and refried beans.  You'll love love love it.

Two can dine with drinks for about $20....including a cookie.  

Friendly staff always which we appreciate! :)"}
{"text":"I've been hearing for years we needed to come here and we finally made the trek.  I'm just sorry we did not do it sooner!

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the concept.  But the moment I tasted my first sample, I was already in love.  Rarely do I find a restaurant that gives out free samples like they do on your first visit that ends up having bad food.  This is the \"hey we know our food is so good we're going to give you some before you even buy it!\"

I had the carnitas with black beans and jerk fried rice while hubby had the jade red chicken quesadilla, jerk chicken, pork fried rice and black beans.  Everything was completely flavorful on their own and tasted great together; even the beans!  The jerk chicken is quite spicy - in a very good way and the carnitas were packed with flavor."}
{"text":"I came to this place with my friends, they were talking about how good it was. So once I got here I placed my order I received my food and while I was eating I see 2 HUGE roaches crawling around it was disgusting. I immediately threw my good away which wasn't even that good and walked away. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido would be legendary if it were walking distance to ASU or any major university. It is everything that a great college restaurant should be cheap, unique, quick, kinda dirty and it has sense of humor about itself. That being said it's not a college establishment rather its buried in the northern suburbs of Phoenix (there is a Chandler location as well) in a boring intersection that outside of Chino Bandido has nothing of interest. 

But the food is good especially when considering the price. The jade chicken is a good safe pick for first timers but i think the jerk chicken is the best, however it has some kick. I also like the pollo diablo but heed the warning it is very spicy. The carnitas was ok but if i got it again it would be in a burrito as it seems shredded beyond being served in a bowl. 
As for the ordering system it seems unnecessarily efficient (assuming the customers can figure it out). I've never noticed a line out the door that would put the system to good use but it hardly takes anything away from the place other than it is difficult to ask the employees what is good or what the hell 'B' means. If it is your first time look for another customer to help you out or go to the website, it explains the process."}
{"text":"You gotta be kiddin me, not even worth the hype, bad Chinese and Mexican, definetly belongs in dives"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would come up with zero stars or at least a middle finger rating because that's what I think of this place.

Let me tell you something white people...just because you like Asian food and Mexican food, does not mean a combo of both is a good idea! 

This place was packed and people were taking pics outside so I was pretty stoked to try it. We waited in line and then comes the ordering part, which is confusing. After finally figuring it out, we ordered our food. I got the jaded chicken (I think that's what it was) and the ginger onion chicken with black beans and rice. My friend got something else and the jade chicken. 

We went and took a seat...we tried our food...she said it was \"ok\" and all I ended up eating was the rice. The black beans are bland. The rice is rice. The jade chicken tastes like buffalo wings with a sweet sauce. And the ginger chicken was dry and gross. The cookie was sour. 

I looked around because I was just shocked at how people love this place and of course...there was not a single Mexican in that place nor a single Asian. It was White people central and it all made sense. 

The food did not sit well. I felt sick for almost a week after eating this crap. NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"I was in Chino Bandido on Sunday at around 1PM.  I've eaten there before and knew what to expect from the food and atmosphere.  I was sadly disappointed this time around.

It took 30 minutes for my order of a combo and a burrito to be brought out.  They were busy, but not THAT busy.  It seemed for a good 10 minutes nothing was being brought out and then 1 by 1 items were coming out every 3-5 minutes.  

How long does it take to plate up food which is already prepared?

The restaurant was a disaster too.  There was food all over the the empty tables, food on the ground, trash left everywhere.  One of the tables had a completely spilled drink on it.  The utensil area was demolished.  There was trash and spilled drinks all over it.  There was no forks to be found anywhere, I had to go ask for one at the front.  There was a sauce container that spilled in the box with with the other sauces and it was a big gooey mess!  The entire hour I was in the restaurant, I didn't see anyone cleaning up or restocking the utensil area.

Finally, the food.  After 30 minutes of waiting, they brought out the food.  The food was tepid warm at best, not hot.  Like it had been sitting for awhile.  I had egg foo yong, it looked like jelled brown snot sitting on the patty, nothing very appetizing about it all.  The, patty itself was pretty tasty as was my chicken dish I had too.

Hello Manager!!  Wake up, I don't care if you got busy, my dining experience shouldn't suffer because there are customers in your store.  There's a lot of other places in Chandler I can spend $15 at for lunch.

This isn't the same place Guy Fieri reviewed on his show.  I classify this as a DIRTY DIVE!!!  

Clean it up and figure out how to handle a rush better.  It'll be awhile for me to come back, if I do at all!"}
{"text":"I am sorry but this has got to be the worst food I have ever tasted... 
I really wish I had never tried it in the first place."}
{"text":"I am knocking this place off by funding a location here in effen SF.

I am calling it... El Chino Bandito.  Instead of a mexican panda, I'm using a Chinese iguana with chinkie eyes.  He'll still carry two BIG guns a la John Woo and he'll be standing on a magic carpet cuz there'll be curry dishes too.

I shouldn't Yelp when I'm hungry"}
{"text":"I like the staff, but each time I eat here I just regret it. I want to love it, but I just can't handle all of the greasy and heavily breaded food."}
{"text":"I love the idea of fusing Mexican and Chinese foods! In this case, they fused the fast food aspects of both! Think of Panda Express fused with a Filibertos and this is what you get! Except it's way better! 

I am so sad that the one in chandler closed! I had to come all the way to this one to get my fix after years of not eating this stick. I always get the same combo whenever I go! I get the orange chicken quesadilla, the jerk fried rice, and the bbq pork burrito! It always ends up being a little more than I ordered, but leftovers are fine with me. 

The sauces are awesome there too! It's some kind of fusion of hoisin sauce and salsa. Just take it all and dump it all in your plate! If you have the urge for a cookie too, they make pretty good snickerdoodle cookies too."}
{"text":"I wonder what samples Jan D received? If they had given me samples, it would have saved me $8.74 because I would have run out the door right after the first bite.

I think the place everyone else ate at, has been replaced and I found myself at the new Chino Bandido, a shit dump that serves food that tastes worse than if a Panda Express threw up on Del Taco. I should have known this would be a disaster if Guy Fieri has been here. When is his 15 minutes up? Every time I go somewhere that Guy Fieri has featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, it always turns out to be one of the worst places I have ever been. Guy Fieri knows as much about food as McDonalds does. First, I didn't even get what I ordered, They make a huge deal about how to order, how about getting the order right? What they gave me couldn't have been more opposite to what I ordered. I ordered black beans and plain fried rice. They gave me refried beans and pork fried rice, or some fried rice that was contaminated with a pseudo disgusting meat-like product. I ordered a jade red burrito, they gave me something with slimy pork inside, and I asked for a veggie quesadilla, they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatty chicken and a horrible sauce. The bag was filled with grease, even on the bottom of it. It made a bag from Five Guys look healthy.

I guess for some, it is a novelty to mix Asian and Mexican. If you really want to enjoy such fusion, head to Vegas and try China Poblano, the creation of Jose Andres. If you are drunk or high, between the hours of 11 am and 9 pm and in Phoenix, and you have a need to consume a pile of shit, this place will satisfy such a craving."}
{"text":"This place is a must go. Prices are just right. I couldn't decide on what to get to eat and my wife suggested chino and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The ability to get mediocre Chinese AND Mexican food at the same time amounts to a whole experience much greater than the sum of its parts. Never has foreign cuisine been bastardized so effectively...but it works.

Think of it as a Panda Express and Taco Bell sharing the same building, only they're totally down to mix up items. You want machaca over fried rice? Sure. Terriyaki chicken quesadilla? Not even a problem. The goal is to satisfy both cravings for $10, and I don't think that can be done anywhere else. 

I prefer to uh...keep my food separated, with a rice bowl and a small quesadilla. \"You could have saved money by making it a combo!\" they said as my food was brought. Too bad no one pointed that out as I handed in the multiple choice test that was my order. I came here to eat, not to fill out paperwork!

Diners rave about the Jade Chicken, and I don't think it's half bad. It's taste is vaguely orange and is a tad on the oily side, and looks and tastes like sweet and sour cut with buffalo sauce...which is weird, but works. Top it off with a bite-sized cheese crisp, a cookie, and perhaps even a reasonably-priced craft beer! 

On your way out, feel free to grab one of the mock Chinese T-Shirts...it's politically correct, but when the rest of the decor looks decades old, I at least appreciate the antiquity of the establishment as a whole. It excels in nothing. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Each item alone is just a-ok. It's the sheer variety and speed of service that forces me to rate it so highly with an extra star."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken fried rice was incredible and the red jade chicken was delicious and the perfect heat.  However, if you are trying to eat healthy, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the DDD tv show and had to travel to Phoenix on business so we decide to try this unusual combo of  Mexican, Chinese and Jamaican cuisine. We totally loved Chino Bandito,! Jade red chicken, pork fried rice and egg fu young in my combo bowl. My husband had black beans, jerk chicken, jade red chicken quesadilla  and jerk fried rice. All yummy. The bonus is the bill came to $18 for the two of us with 2 sodas and two cookies! The cookies were delicious too, can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"One of our most favorite \"dives\".  Food is a unique fusion of Chinese, mexican, and jamaican.  Dont let the shopping center or the decor deter you as both are bit on the \"rustic\" side.
Definitely a \"must try\" if you are in Phoenix!j
Note to vegetarians and vegans-ask them to make you something and they will have a few suggestions for you.  The posted menu is pure carnivore."}
{"text":"3 stars. Food wasnt bad but it clearly didn't live up to the hype. Place was really dirty from floors to the tables but its not trying to be anything it isn't either. Staff was extremely friendly (may have influenced a few reviews). I had the jade chicken and the pollo diablo, both were average."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love chino bandito. It is located in a strip mall so there is great parking. This little gem is worth going to. You will see when you walk into the front door. There is always a lin of people.  Do not let that defer you. Your food will be made quickly. And it is so worth it. The staff is amazing. You can sample before you buy. I love the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know. A lot of people seem to think the idea of combining Chinese and Mexican is 'cool' - for me it's more about the quality of the food and service - and I was underwhelmed, just not impressed by the service and the food was very so so...But the place was very busy and  crowed, as was the parking challenge outside. No plans to revisit."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this amazing culmination of my two favorite foods! Chinese/Japanese and Mexican. Unbelievable. It is for sure one of those have to try it before you die kind of experiences. 

I first heard about Chino Bandito from Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives, Guy kind of good at find those amazing little hold in the wall, mom and pop, ghetto looking food heavens! :-) 

When you get there is doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter, just a bit of a step up from a Filly-B's. But the experience and food makes up for it ten fold! One of the best parts is the tasting they walk you through if it is your first time, or if you just need more help figuring out what flavor you are craving that day. They will give you 6 or so tastes from the menu, and explain any of the others that sound good. Then they turn you loose to come up with any concoction you can imagine; Terriaki chicken and fried rice in a burrito, carnitas over white rice, sweet and sour chicken in a quesadilla with a side of re-fried beans, emerald chicken (chicken with this amazing pesto type sauce) and black beans and rice..... I could go on and on. 

They also have the most delicious cookies for dessert. You gotta check this place out. If you are on the other side of town, trust me it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Chino has been a long time family favorite. My dad has been eating Chino since the place opened, and he says the quality is still the best. The food is a unique blend of Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican cuisines. My favorite combination is the Jade Red Chicken, the Pollo Diablo with Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice (That's 7 & 13 BLK JFR on the menu)! You can't beat the sweetness and perfectly fried taste of the Jade Red Chicken. The Pollo Diablo is a deliciously spicy and tangy combination of garlic, green onion, peppers, and spices with the most aromatic and crispy cornstarch fried chicken gems. The black beans are the best I have ever had, and they are perfectly smoothed out, accompanied by some gooey melted cheese on top! Do not leave without getting some of their amazing hot sauce! It pairs very well with the Pollo Diablo. Every meal gets a free cookie, the soft and chewy snickerdoodles are definitely our favorite! Eat in or take out, the quality is always good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So sad one in Chandler closed. I love the jerk fried rice and carnitas."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was really schechy about this place because it is a Mexican and Chinese food fusion and I happend to be Chinese.  I also saw this on the food network on Chowdown countdown.  For some reason I wanted to try this place to see how bad it was and for some reason it is not bad at all.  At first when you walk into this place you see a white server and a bunch of hispanics cooking the food and you are like where are the Asians.  But I have to admit the service was really great. The girl served me plenty of samples to try.

I had the jade chicken, burrito machato, black beans, chicken fried rice and it was not bad.  They do give you plenty of food for the price, but the ordering is confusing.  I remember the girl was nice enough to fill in the order form for me.  

As for the food, it was not greasy at all and did not give me a stomach ache which is a good thing.  Also, I did see an Asian person eat there too.  Oh I loved the cookie as well.  Something that does not go well with Chinese and Mexican food, but okay. Anyways it was not bad and I probably go back and eat there."}
{"text":"the front counter girl rolled her eyes  when I  asked her  what came with the combo.  that set the mood  for the rest of the\" experience\".  food  was mediocre  at best.  ordered the red jade  chicken,  nor sure what we ended up with. pork  rice  was horrible, machaca  was decent.  all in all,  the  place  was not worth  the $ 22.00  spent on 2  meals."}
{"text":"For me, this is comfort food. The flavors work so well together. I always get the black beans and jerk fried rice with any combination."}
{"text":"We ordered before a wave of people came in. It took forever to get our food. Twice I asked employees to check on our order. Both times they cut me off and told me they were too just to busy to check. Both times I explained that people who ordered after me had already eaten and we're leaving. Both times they cut me off again. When they finally slowed down they realized that they did screw up, one of the employees that cut me off brought the food out. No apologies, no a acknowledgement...just Below average luke warm food."}
{"text":"---Good--- Friendly service and I enjoyed the food.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items, but right now I'm kinda perturbed about this place.

---Bad---  1) This is just dumb, how could you ever think of putting push/push doors on your bathrooms? Walk anywhere near the doors and you'll be smacked.  Buy two $.89 door handles and fix the problem.

2) No ice tea or was it hidden and I had to press a magic button and the tea fairy would appear?

3)The ordering system is not unique or funny, it sucks, it blows, it makes me want to kick a puppy.    Why must I use my secret decoder ring to find the code for what I want to order for lunch?     Example: First write the number of the entree down, if you want a burrito put a \"B\" next to it -BUT THEY DON\"T TELL YOU THAT!!!!     WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF   Why make me figure all this out when all I want is lunch.

4)Huge pictures of, what you would think to be, menu items above the register so you can order/figure out your selections. The first this she says was something like \" These are not our menu items\". Awesome, thanks for the mind fuck.

But the food was good."}
{"text":"OK this place has been on diners drive-ins and dives and I have been here a handful of times. It is the one place where when you are talking about going out and grabbing food that everyone forgets, however when you remember it everyone always says HECK YEAH!!

Chino Bandido is Chinese Mexican fusion (yeah I know at first it sounds NASTY) but they really make it work.

When you go in immediately to your right you will see order forms. Now I will be honest the first time, and the second time I went in I wondered how I was supposed to fill it out. It appeared that I would need to use college level algebra. However if you ask the staff they will explain it and it actually is really easy.

My favorite is the combination of Jade Red Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken, with Jerk Fried Rice and Refried Beans.

Warning the Jerk Chicken is HOT (now I can hear my friend Chris in the background calling me a weenie, however be warned.) With each dish they have cookies either a snickerdoodle which is awesome but their volcano cookies are DELICIOUS. You get a chocolate cookie you put a warm gooey center and top with powdered sugar.

All in all one of my favorite places in the Valley to eat in or bring home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a long time favorite place for tasty food.  Granted, it isn't a swanky kind of place.  I am not bothered by the place, but I do get my order for takeout. 

My regular order is a 2 meat combo which includes jade chicken quesadilla and a serving of jade chicken with black beans and chicken fried rice. While I have tried other combinations, this is my go to meal.  The portions are large enough that I always have enough for lunch the next day.  This is the reason I get one serving of jade chicken (no quesadilla) because it reheats best.  

As if all the wonderful food wasn't enough, a snickerdoodle cookie is always included.  H-e-l-l-o my little snickerdoodle, come to mama!

The staff is always happy to help newcomers and are quite fast at clearing a long line. I truly hope this restaurant never changes a thing."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido has the best food you never thought you'd ever enjoy.  

I ordered the combo plate since I wanted to try a wider variety of what they had.  I got their ginger chicken, the jade chicken, the pork fried rice, and the black beans and jerk fried chicken wrapped into a burrito. 

Ginger chicken: awesome
Jade chicken: awesome
Pork fried rice: great but not something you eat just by itself, you've got to mix it up with everything else 
Black beans: omg - these are great.  I'm not sure why but they tasted like pizza tomato sauce but hey, pizza tomato sauce tastes good too.

I'll be back again, it was pretty good and while I was sitting at the picnic tables (the plastic folding tables rock) I read up on the history of Chino Bandido online and it's just an all around great story of a super successful family owned establishment that came up with a unique menu and hit a home run. 

If you're up for something new and something you won't find elsewhere, swing by and grub.  I'm bringing some friends from London and Hong Kong to eat here later this week.  I'm sure they'll love it."}
{"text":"Love love love Chino's! So many choices and no matter what I get each time they never disappoint. Plus it's fast and at a good price. The Emerald Chicken is my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido.  Very unique restaurant.  You wont find anything else like it.  Fusion between Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  And with practically all the entrees or combinations available, you will be aware of the mixtures of tastes when you eat.  Maybe I appreciate the concept in a personal way, as I am a creation of a Jewish father and Indonesian mother.

When you first walk in - you will quickly note that ordering procedure is goofy.  Fear not because they have a special side station where they take in new people, offer tasters of all the dishes and help you with the process.  Thinking like a good process engineer, I can envision better efficiency but I suppose this works for the staff who I'm sure have been working there for a long time.  Rather than thinking about a thousand possibilities, I figured out that I will take #1 & #7 (jade red) with some sort of fried rice w/o beans, every single time.  And I suppose there isnt too much Mexican about that choice.

So why do I give it a 2/5 star rating?  First, I can always count on enduring an MSG bomb moments after absorbing the meal.  I hate that.  Second, after seeing the Food Network \"Diners Dives Drive-ins\" special about the restaurant, I now have seen what makes the food taste so good.  Lets just say lots of the saturated fat content that I typcically try to avoid.  Finally,  its not cheap.  On the positive, at least after eating the entire contents of the silver pie tin, no one leaves hungry.

ps.  If big, cheese, greasy, and tasty is what you are thinking - I suggest having the #2 chile rellano.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I though Triple D and I had a good relationship, but this time he lied to me!  I was not pleased with this place, food was mediocre, bland and overall lacking.  Maybe it is not a good choice for herbivores (carnivores definitely have more options).

I had the chile relleno. It was heavily breaded, greasy and I'm sure made with kraft cheese shreds. They were out of the egg fu yung and I didn't want a quesadillas so I went with salad, rice and black beans.   The black beans at Chipotle has more flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always good food. I would definitely recommend the Jade Red Chicken and the snickerdoodles :) Been going there for many,many years and will keep on going."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is sooo delicious. I am talking greasy-make-you-feel-guilty-for-eating-it-bloated-for-hours-SCRUMPTIOUS! Totally worth it! 

Its a mexican/chinese food place. Thats right, you mix the two. I went with my husband and he had to save me from being a rookie. YOu have to get adventurous and mix the combos. Get a diablo chicken quesadilla or a jerk chicken burrito. I highly recommend the chili relleno, it was awesome.  They also give you a free ginger snap cookie with your meal, they are perfect!

Dont over-do it (its easier than you think because its so good) this place is loaded in sodium so if you leave really full you are going to be 3 times as full when you get home! I will warn you, the place is divey, but the food is so good you zone out your surroundings and just focus on disgracing yourself by eating like someone denied food for days."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Our first visit as out of town guests, when we walked in we were created, offered samples and walked through each dish. It was obvious that they take pride in their food. Ordered the jerk chicken and carnitas. Food was on point and black beans were to die for!!! My only suggestion would be to \"spiffy up the place\". Dining area was a dive but the food itself is enough to return for!! Great taste all around."}
{"text":"02.07.10

I'm not going to lie, extra star cuz I like saying the name.  Chino Bandido!  Say it with me now.  Chino Bandido.

This is a great place for first timers.  They treat you to an array of samples and then hold your hand the rest of the way through your order.

We finally decided to split a combo with jerk chicken fried rice, jerk chicken quesadilla and a milder version (#6) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=CYvTr9FyNWmnyn4Fqud0QA].

Sutter Home wine for $3 to go with your meal.

The jerk chicken fried rice haunts my dreams.

Seriously, who would have thought to put Chinese food in a quesadilla?"}
{"text":"This was the first time visiting the original location, had been to Chandler location a few years ago. Stopped going because I moved to Flagstaff for school. Honestly I remember the food being better. I was unimpressed by my greasy emerald chicken quesadilla. The pork fried rice was pretty good in comparison. 

Might try to come back a few more times before writing it off. Definitely worth a try though if you've never been. The ordering can be tricky so heads up."}
{"text":"Came here after hearing people rave about this Chinese-Carribean-Mexican fusion place. I love the concept and the gun toting panda logo makes me smile. The servers are very friendly and tell you everything on the menu is great.  I beg to differ, but will elaborate later on in the review.

Go to the left if you want to sample the food, go to the right to order. The family and I were hangry so we decided to order based on Yelp reviews and pictures. In retrospect, I wish we took the Yelp advice and sampled stuff first.

We ordered the combination rice bowls below and the machaca bowl:
- Jade red chicken, Pollo Diablo, jerk fried rice, black beans
- Carnitas quesadilla, Chile relleno, pork fried rice, refried beans

My favorite taste by far was the pollo diablo. It was well seasoned, the chicken was tender, and I found myself wanting more. The Jade red chicken is very similar to \"orange chicken\" at Panda Express and was fairly standard to me. The carnitas is shredded and tender. The staff suggested putting it in a quesadilla, which was well made but the under seasoned carnitas was not a hit with me. The chile relleno was my least favorite thing. It is not egg battered, but seems to be bathed in crushed saltine crackers and deep fried. Now I LOVE most things fried, but I actually had to take the breading off it was so thick and too oily for me.  The pork fried rice and jerk fried rice were fairly standard as far as fried rice goes. The black beans are tastier than the refried beans.

The peanut butter cookie that came with the combination meal helped rescue my impression, but unfortunately not enough. I'd probably give it 4 stars for the great service, 3 stars for a unique food concept, but 2 stars for the actual food which dragged down my rating."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for something a little different.  Relleno is awesome!  Service was good and they are always busy."}
{"text":"I've never tried something I didn't like here .  My fave is jade red chicken, an emerald chicken quesadilla , retried beans and jerk rice .  Finished off with a snickerdoodle and I'm a happy gal ."}
{"text":"Not only is the fusion concept an amazing idea, but the food is so good and the staff is wonderful. This unassuming strip mall location can fool you. They've gotten a lot of exposure (DDD), but so far it really hasn't changed them, from what I can see. Locals love it, well everyone loves it. Free samples for newbies and help with the menu. (Once you get it, it makes sense, but it's a little daunting at first. After a single visit we were ordering like pros.)
It's a family friendly place, though we only do take out currently, because we have an energetic 2 year old. She wouldn't stay in the chairs, we always do booths, but there aren't any. Otherwise, this place is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Solid place with some unique pairings. I've had a few better Mexican-Chinese combo places in Brooklyn, but it's unfair to compare this to New York. The food is good, if not sometimes slightly over seasoned. Definitely worth going for a lunch or smaller meal, just don't plan an entire day around it because you may be let down."}
{"text":"Keeping up with my belief that the more sketchy a place is the better, Chino Bandido delivered. 

I had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and what was $6 of food tasted like $10+. The fried rice had a mushroom presence as well ^^

I also appreciated the salsa
It appealed to my spicy side~

Like Jeff said below the food is surprisingly not oily and msg-laden.

Only in America would I find Tex-Mex and American Chinese food in such a happy marriage.

(Beats Panda Express)"}
{"text":"The Emerald Chicken is a flavorless bust.  Everything else  is very, very good (i.e., black beans, red jade chicken, jerk chicken, carnitas).  I like the new space and the bring it to your table service.  The only drawback is that if I go here for lunch, a food coma is sure to occur."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for so many years and they are AMAZING! I get the jade chicken white rice and refried beans and it works together so well!! I will never stop coming here!"}
{"text":"Menu is diverse but you will need an open mind.  Food is tasty and prepared to order.  Decor leaves a little to be desired but that's ok.

The offer kids simple chicken and rice just in case.

Pricing is fair but it can be overwhelming to pick something that you may not actually end up loving.

Best advice:  Go with friends and get a few things to share.  That way everyone gets to sample several dishes."}
{"text":"Loving this place since I was a kid. Stopped eating meat three years ago, so I miss the Jerk Fried Rice and Carnitas and Emerald Chicken, BUT the Veggie Quesadilla with black beans and white rice is amazing with their tasty red salsa.

Always amazing customer service and it's great that they let you taste everything before you commit. 

They should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging. I always feel guilty when I leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam.

BTW, don't be swayed by offers of other cookies; snickerdoodles are where it's at."}
{"text":"It's like a panda express meets any of the taquerias you see around the valley. The jerk chicken is my personal favorite for the quesadillas and the black beans are A-1, would slap someone's momma, just not mines. 

This establishment has been around for years and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"The regular location for #techlunchnorth, I was there again today.

I have been a fan of Chino Bandido for many years, and was pleased to be able to return, after moving back to AZ.

Today I ordered the jerk chicken, and carnitas.

The jerk chicken is always one of my choices; it's moist and tender, and the seasonings have enough of a kick to make it \"jerk\", but not enough for you to want to call the cook that.

The carnitas seemed a bit dry today. I've had it in the past, but today something seemed off.

Chicken-fried rice, and black beans, to round out the meal.

And the cookie is always a delicious treat after the meal.

Easy and fast, and good flavor. A perfect combination."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe HOW fantastic the food is at Chino's! (on my most recent visit this week, the meat portions seems much less than usual, maybe a different cook???) Anyhow....

Get there at 11am for a table and a good parking spot. Hungry people start piling in alittle before 11:30am...lunch gets so busy that there is a line out the door !

Friendly and helpful staff!!! Food comes out quickly.

Like already mentioned, the strip mall that it's located is dirty and pretty gross. Not that you are eating in the parking lot, but don't let that be a first impression of CB.

Also, don't let the fact that CB is a real dive and very \"low-key\"....the food is so worth it, if you are in the mood for something different and OH, so delicious! FIVE-STARS for the AWESOMELY YUMMY food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is great. Not a fancy restaurant. But the food they serve is awesome..."}
{"text":"Oh, good lord, what to say about this place? This was my second time here; first visit was a few years ago but I couldn't remember much about it other than what a kooky fusion of ethnic food they have.

I noticed more on my second visit... the slightly, shall we say, humble digs just make it all the more quirky, but really don't take away from the food, which is the most important thing IMO. The place was packed at 1:00 on a Saturday. I got the veggie tostada with rice and split a black-bean tostada with my sister (I guess they only have black bean tostadas on the weekends) and it was a guilty little pleasure. There were lots of crying kids, the floor was dirty and the place was packed, so you can see what the real draw is for this place. 

I wish we had a place like it back home in Minneapolis. There is Chino Latino in Uptown Minneapolis, but it definitely lacks the uber-quirky, low-rent charm of this place, and really needs a Mexican panda statue in the entrance. :)"}
{"text":"Chinese $ Mexican!!! 2 cuisines that are usually peoples favorite. I've been here once and let me tell you, great stuff. I went here with about 10 people and they all loved it. Especially the Red jade Chicken.....awesome. The Emerald chicken in a quesadilla was also a favorite. Make sure you order the black beans and the jerk fried rice. Seriously don't forget. I do have to say it is kinda weird being served in a aluminium foil bowl, but who gives a S%$t, the food in it is good. I will come here everytime I visit my bro in the big AZ. Peace."}
{"text":"Surprisely very good combination. If you don't care for the decor and just want good food,  this is the place. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall for its unique taste and fair pricing :) keep it real guys and continue to make good food and big portions. More Cajun would be good too ;)"}
{"text":"Wow just wow.   Jerk chicken and jade red chicken oh soooooo yummiiii!!!   Im sad that they are a bit of a drive.   It be nice if they would open up in peoria, az.   But well worth the drive when we really craving it."}
{"text":"Came because of Diners Drive Ins & Dives! #guilty Finally made it! Last time I tried the line was out the door down the strip mall.... (made me wanna come back)**Red Jade chicken - sweet n tangy glazed chicken, more tangy than spicy, very tasty, not big pieces of chicken**Emerald Chicken - ginger n scallion w sliced chicken breasts - light n refreshing, chicken moist & tender **Jerk chicken fried Rice or Quesadilla - mild jamaican jerk chicken, pretty decent given its a Chinese mexican joint  **Snicker Doodle Cookie - free with every meal!!! #delish **Pass on the kids meals unless ur kid is under 3 & eats like they just turned 3 **Could me cleaner & redone with all the business this place gets. But staff was nice. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and recenlty had the opportunity. A few of my coworkers and I were at a training in Phoenix and desiring a spot for lunch.  A quick click of my GPS for local restaurants and Chino Bandino populated my screen. I shared the philosophy with my coworkers, my desire to try this place and they were game.

It was lunch time and busy when we arrived. We were a little confused as the place was crowded with people. One of the employees came over and inquired if he could help us and we explained that we were first timers. He took us to a side bar and gave all four of us samples of the Jade Chicken, the Carnitas, black beans, fried rice and a few others all of which were delicious. We excitedly ordered and sat down for our feast. Suffice to say we were stuffed when we returned to our training. Around 3pm the Snickerdoodle came in handy for our late day snack. Each of us enjoyed this outing and we shall return."}
{"text":"I was thinking they deserved a 3.5 star review, so I'll err on the side of generosity as they are certainly one of a kind. If it's your first visit, tell them so you can get the menu tour, which is some of their more popular items. You fill your order out on a card and hand it over to the cashier, which then reads it back to you so I don't see how it really saves any time.

There are seemingly countless options, as they have 15 entrees, each one can come alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla, and you get two entrees in a combo platter. The platter also comes with your choice of 5 rices and 2 beans (don't bother with the pinto, go for the house-recipe Cuban beans). My wife and I agree that the Jade Red chicken is the best (and the menu proclaims it as the most popular). Their Jerk chicken is very spicy, but the jerk fried rice has just the right amount of heat.  All entrees come with fresh baked snickerdoodles (or on Saturdays, the option for a chocolate cookie). 

After ordering, you find a seat in the cafeteria-style dining room, or outdoors on a nice day (not July or August). The location is tough to find though, hidden in the back behind a Walgreens and Brake shop. Still, it's worth the small hunt. I've been back several times since, but others I've brought with me have mixed thoughts on the food."}
{"text":"After watching Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives review of Chino Bandido i decided to give it a try. On the show the owner said you can make something like  20 thousand different combinations. Wow! Sounds great right? 
To begin this multi-cultural journey I decided to look at their menu online where they have a tutorial to learn how to order. Easy enough. As I spouted out my order \"can I get a combination 8, 9B JFR; BLK\" I realized I had no clue what I was about to get myself into.  

The combination of all of the flavors was just odd. I really really wanted to like it, but in the end it was just a heap of odd-tasting food that just didn't work. I will give it to them for doing something new, but be forewarned the jerk chicken will light your face on fire!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today after seeing it on The Food Network some time ago. I have to say, the person working the sample counter was very helpful in explaining the ordering process. 

However, the food was not worth the money. I was seriously disappointed in the quality and quantity of it. I had the Jade Red chicken and it was very bland. The breading was too thick, the chicken stringy and odd tasting and hardly any sauce on the chicken itself. There also were no vegetables in sight. Not healthy at all. Like many other reviewers have also stated, the food goes right through you. 

I wanted to like this place, I really did. It is an interesting concept but falls way short. On a side note, my family was sitting under the ginormous TV and one of the other patrons decided to crank the TV volume way up. We couldn't hold a conversation after that and decided to just leave rather than complain to management. Overall, a very disappointing visit and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So annoyed that I've lived here for 6 years now and just recently tried this place!!! So unique and so delicious!!! Jade chicken quesidillas and carnitas burrito are my go-to! Don't pass this place up!!!"}
{"text":"Man this place is something else.

The food is tasty, the place is a totally wonderful dive, and the staff are fantastic.  I just wish the protein portions were larger and the rice and beans a little smaller.  They're all fantastic.  I got the Jade Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk fried rice.  I think next time I'll try the emerald chicken in a quesdilla."}
{"text":"This place has been here a long time. Still awesome! The jerked chicken is perfection. Warm enough to make me sweat, and make my nose run...but can still taste it...samples are the ticket! These guys know how to do it right!"}
{"text":"Revisiting after a 10 year hiatus.  No major changes... Just quick, good, tasty Chinese, Mexican food.  As I recall, CB is one of the first Asian fusion places to exist and continue to exist because it is just good.  Where else can you get, Fried Rice, Refried Beans, Carnitas, Ginger Green Onion Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Chili Relleno, Jerk Chicken, all in one plate.  No nonsense food in a simple - order, pay, take out or eat in, bring to your table if you eat in place, clear your own plate,and waddle out happy.  Oh yes, complimentary Snickerdoodle cookie for later."}
{"text":"Just had to try this place when I heard it was Asian-Mexican fusion and was featured on Triple-D with Guy Fieri. I will admit that I studied up beforehand, since some very resourceful Yelpers mentioned the complexity of the ordering system. It was worth walking through their \"How to Order\" demo on their website to know what to do.

The staff was extremely helpful when I approached the counter and volunteered that I was a Chino-Bandido virgin. They even provided tasting samples and suggestions that helped me understand what the different flavor profiles were. I settled on the combo (2 meat entrees, choice of beans, choice of rice) and chose Pollo Diablo (meat alone), Jen Red Pork (in a quesadilla), jerk fried rice and black beans. All were delicious and the servings generous. I dared not finish my quesadilla for fear the Oompah Loompahs would have to roll my fat ass out the door afterward.

I think there's a bit of a learning curve to eating here, but I enjoyed the unique dining experience. One of the staff even spotted my Chico State shirt and we instantly started chatting, since he was also from my neck of the woods (northern northern California, I like to call it). I learned that next time I'm going with the meat entrees as meat alone (as opposed to in a burrito or quesadilla), since there is more than enough of the sides to fill you up and the extra packaging only serves to mask the unique flavors of their savory meat choices.

I'll make a trip back, but I'm gonna save up some room first. The last meal resulted in a serious mid-afternoon lunch coma nap."}
{"text":"My slow initiation into Phoenix and slowly Arizona as a whole is progressing, what better way to do that than to check out this Guy Fieri \"Triple D\" hot spot.

Sketchy lot, run down interior, decent pricing and variety of samples at the counter. Sounds like a legit place in my book especially when it comes to Mexican, however this pride and joy of Phoenix left a lot to be desired.

As suggested by many on Yelp and a fellow Arizonian friend  I got the Red Jade Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Refried Beans. 

Red Jade Chicken- like orange chicken, just more tomato flavor
Pork Fried Rice- Nothing special
Carnitas- Good texture of pork, seasoned well, but lacking in flavor dimension
Refried Beans- Wasn't a big fan
Snickerdoodle- everything!

Just an A-OK for me because of the Red Jade Chicken and free, amazing Snickerdoodle cookie given with the meal. Pricing seems a bit steep for just two entrees, beans and rice plus a fountain drink ~$10 I'd honestly just go to Panda Express, where it's about the same price, cleaner and have an easier ordering system. 

However, if you're looking for a place that will fill you up and to go crazy on the endless combinations you can make- you'll be able to do that here. Would I come back? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I love this place the only problem is that the last few times I have gone there the service was a little less than what I am used to.  The cook and the cashier were arguing over my order and I was hoping it wouldn't get taken out on my food!!!! 
I would definitely eat here again.  
Recommend the emerald chicken, black beans, chicken fried rice, and jerk chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido... what to say... what to say. Before my visit to Phoenix, I was told by three different people of YelpLou that this place was a must visit. When Matt R and Michael R tell you to visit somewhere, it's always serious business. When Christopher S makes a recommendation for a city where he lived for a short time, you know it's the legit business. When serious and legit come together... well, it's nothing. Actually, it's serious legit business. 

The operation that is Chino Bandido is solid. The owners started this business nearly 30 years ago because they wanted a place where they could order Mexican/Asian combos! The place has grown. Chino has been featured on the Food Network and on numerous best of lists. 

Before I get to all the good stuff and there are a lot of good things about this food spot, I'll tell you the one thing that I didn't like. The black beans are more of a paste rather than a bean. If the beans were beans and not paste, that would shoot this place straight to tree-fiddy(350) stars.

With all of the recommendations, I didn't do much research until we were in the car and on our way. I looked at the menu and was immediately overwhelmed! Lots of choices! At this point, I sent Matt and Michael a text asking them for recommendations. Michael immediately started rattling off burritos but that was because she had Bandido(The Louisville Bandido on her brain). Matt said to order a combo but to get one of the items as a burrito or quesadilla. Ok, but I still have to decide on what I want. Palms were sweaty... anxiety everywhere... heart racing... I HAD TO ORDER THE RIGHT THING! It was about that time Michael's text came through... \"Oh, lol. Totes forgot. Get a snickerdoodle!\" When Michael exclaims, you listen. 

On to the food. They have an entire wall of pictures to choose from. You order a one or two combo meal. The price difference between the one/two combos is so minimal that you have to order the two combo meal.

My order:
-- Jerk Chicken (opted for quesadilla) -- This was the perfect thing to order in quesadilla form. Every bite was delicious. Spicy. Moist. Memorable. 
-- Fried Chile Relleno - Ever since I started ordering Chile Relleno a few years ago, I get it when I see it. This one was a little different because it was fried. It was piping hot and tough to cut(since it was fried). Next time I'm there, I'll certainly order it again.
-- Black Beans - These coming out as paste was just so disappointing.
-- White Rice - They have four different types of rice to choose from(Jerk Fried, Chicken Fried, Plain Fried, Pork Fried). I suppose it was plain fried that I got because I asked for white rice. White rice wins all.
-- The coveted Snickerdoodle cookie. I'm officially calling it the Michaeldoodle. Best snickerdoodle cookie I've ever had!

I loved it so much that as soon as I finished eating I got up and said to myself, \"I'm buying a shirt!\" With that, I'm the proud owner of a Chino Bandido shirt! This is a must visit while in Phoenix. If you're just passing through, take the detour to visit. 

My girlfriend and her sister also ordered some food but I don't think they liked it as much. They obviously ordered the wrong menu items. I say wrong loosely because it's not that any of the items are bad. I say wrong because there's a high probability that some of the menu items shouldn't be paired together. 

Side notes: 
-- Employees are perfect. 
-- When you arrive, they have someone explaining the menu and taking your order. 
-- Take a moment to read their story and the articles on the wall. 
-- It was reasonably busy. Steady stream with plenty of seating. 
-- They have shirts in many different colors for purchase. 
-- I don't order dessert that often when I visit restaurants but the Michaeldoodle(Snickerdoodle) is a must order.
-- The price is right. The two item combo meals come in at just under 10 bucks. 
-- You order. Your meal comes out fast. You eat. You leave. 
-- Stop reading this! Go here!"}
{"text":"Can't decide between Chinese and Mexican food? This is your spot! Black beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, pollo Diablo, egg fu yung and chile relleno are all amazing! I love to order the egg fu yung or the chile relleno in a quesadilla, yum! Everything I've tried is great, and I've been going for 20 years or so. Great hangover food!"}
{"text":"Went to  Chino Bandito last week and have some complaints. First, I must say the service was excellent. Our first time and the guy working the tasting bins was awesome. Let us try everything we wanted and helped place our orders like a champ... But that's where the good times stopped. We took our order to go... It was a mistake.

My girlfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken and white rice. Her bowl was put together sloppily and had little sauce to flavor the bland unseasoned chicken. The rice wasn't even warm when we made it the two blocks back to our apartment.

I ordered a large or two meat bowl... I asked for the Jen Red pork and Pollo Diablo with pork fried rice and black beans. I didn't get any pork... Neither the Jen Red nor in the fried rice. I think I got the pollo diablo chicken, but it was mostly chopped green onion, loads of garlic, pepper seeds, and enough oil to leave a couple tablespoons in the bowl when all else was removed. There was also a cheese quesadilla in the bowl that I didn't order... There seemed to be twice as much white rice in my girlfriend's single bowl as I was given (on top of getting meatless pork fried rice). The half of the quesadilla that wasn't dripping in oil was good, according to my girlfriend... 

I ate most of what I was given, though my girlfriend told me it was a bad idea... She was right. I ended up with indigestion the likes of which I haven't experienced before. For the next 12-16 hours I was afraid I'd gotten food poisoning. After taking two zantac 150s, three alkaseltzer, and a handful of tums, I was able to sleep... Then awoke two or three times to rush to the bathroom.

I know it was only our first time... But I'd be insane to return. After hearing about this restaurant and tasting all those great tasters, I was hoping to be a loyal consumer."}
{"text":"Our family fav.  Been coming here for years!  Even when I went on a very strict diet due to an illness... they did their best to accommodate me!"}
{"text":"I'm about to change your life in three words: 
Chile Relleno Burrito. 

First and foremost, everything at Chino's is exceptional. It's not fine dinning, but it hits the spot whenever I'm craving something out of the ordinary and affordable. Do you have the munchies right now? If so, stop reading and head to Chino's. I've been eating here since I was a teenager, or rather, I should say feasting here. 


The ordering style at Chino's leaves you with the ability to create your own meal. Typically, I choose the two item combo which comes with rice and beans. Now, you cannot go wrong with either the black beans or pinto beans. I have a hard time making that life choice between the two. Perhaps I'm biased, but I prefer their plain fried rice overall. Once those sides are taken care of, I make the first entree item choice of a Chinese food inspired meat. Honestly, they're all good choices but I find myself getting the teriyaki chicken most often. 

However, my next choice is where the real magic happens. Chile Relleno Burrito. Yes. Yes, you read that right. Now, Chino's Chile Relleno is amazing in and of itself. This is due to the delicious crunchy goodness that they surround their chile it in; I think it's crackers! Ritz, maybe? Delicious, most definitely! Now, imagine that wrapped in more cheesy goodness and a tortilla. Heaven. You've got heaven."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the other day and I really enjoy this place. Dive, yes this is a dive.  Nothing fancy at all. This location is tucked away in a corner and can be a little hard to find.  It's a good sized space with lots of tables.  It's a simple place with a different take on chinese/mexican/carribean food.  I like it.  The portions are generous and it's pretty cheap.  No plates, your food comes in aluminum containers so you can pop a lid on it and take it home if you don't finish.  The menu and how to order can be a little confusing but the folks behind the counter are super helpful and always offer free samples to help you make your decision.  I'd bump it up to 5 starts if it were cleaner.  The tables and floor need to be kept up better.  The soda area is around the corner and I think they tend to forget it because it's usually a bit messy.  If you go in knowing these things you won't be dissappointed.  I'm suddenly craving a jerk chicken quesadilla........"}
{"text":"Alright, I want to take the next few moments to get on a heart-to-heart connection level with you. I love to travel, and have been to many continents and establishments the world over, and still....Chino Bandito is like nothing I have ever experienced before.

**Disclaimer: This is not Mexican food; This is not Chinese food. 

Upon first entering the Chandler Chino Bandito (or China Bandit), one will be greeted by a (seated) giant stone Panda bear that is sporting a mustache and a giant sombrero. It weighs a little over a few tons, and had to be brought in on rollers. I know right?!

Chino Bandito offers a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food combinations that will intially make you scratch your head, but leave anticipating your next visit. For first time visitors they will allow you taste testers of their different rices, beans, and meats so that you can make your choice of burritos, quesadillas, or rice bowls. 

My personal favorite is a two item combo with their Jen Red Quesadilla, Jerk Fried Rice, and special spicy black beans.

The fun thing is that you can choose what type of meats (asian or mexican flavored..don't worry, they have many) you would like to have in your burrito/quesadilla. 

My suggestion would be to get something that doesn't look like it would work well together (i.e. A teriyaki burrito, or an orange {Jen Red} chicken quesadilla). You'll be glad you did.

I can't say this about many things, but I give Chino Bandito a 5/5 easy.

I am only sad I don' live closer."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for over 20 years and have heard of this place and have seen it on tv, but just kept forgetting to check it out. So so so glad a friend choose this place to meet up at. I love the mix of food. I think the jerk chicken rice and black beans are my favorite. Have been back several times and can't wait to go again. You have to try this, don't let the \"fusion\" turn you off."}
{"text":"The idea of Chinese Mexican fusion seems weird but it's pulled off incredibly well here. The amount of combos and customization is a little overwhelming but in a good way.

I'd recommend the Jade chicken strongly"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place! It's awesome.  The food is fast, and it's actually good- giving you a great alternative to any other fast food joints out there.  They serve both Chinese and Mexican food, hence the sombrero wearing panda they have as their mascot.  The menu is filled with rice bowls, fried rice, burritos, quesadillas, combo's and snickerdoodles- yum!  You actually get a few snickerdoodles with your meal, which is a nice touch, I think. 

And if you're a vegetarian, you don't have to worry that you'll be stuck eating white rice and that's it.  They have quite a few veggie friendly items on the menu, and they're pretty accommodating if you have any special requests.  I think there is also a Chino Bandido in Chandler, but I've only ever been to this location. 
 
My recommendation:  skip McDonald's and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Unique little place. Not fusion, but more of a hybrid where Mexican complements Chinese food. Definitely work checking out for a cheap nosh."}
{"text":"Ever had food that's just bad for you, but you keep coming back for more because it's so delicious? Say hello to Chino Bandido - I entirely lacked faith when I first heard about the Asian-Mexican fusion. Jade Red Chicken inside of a cheese quesadilla? I came to a rational conclusion that these foods shouldn't be mixed together, which I partially blame for my extended delay of eating here.

The truth is that Jade Red Chicken was meant to be eaten inside of a cheese quesadilla. Or even a burrito. You can come up with endless combinations here. You choose the meat, then decide whether to get it wrapped in a burrito, placed inside a quesadilla, or just have it straight up by itself. Your entree comes with a side of rice, beans and the infamous Snicker doodle cookie. Don't forget about the Snicker doodle cookie."}
{"text":"this place is great... Rice bowl with red chicken and jerk rice... great combo... and the cookies are amazing..."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to my family immediately when they found out that we were traveling to Phoenix. Of course we went- and I'm glad we did! Chino Bandido is so unique.. Mexican and Asian food aren't a common combination but the food was soo delicious! The snickerdoodles were also scrumptious- my fave!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian Mexican restaurants. There are hundreds of food combinations to choose from. I especially liked their orange flavored chicken. It was nice seeing them featured on Drive-Ins Diners and Dives with Guy Fiery"}
{"text":"Perfection every time I come here! We drive all the way from downtown Phoenix to come to Chino Bandino and it never disappoints. Best Chili Rellenos on this side of heaven!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is a staple.  The Jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken are particularly excellent.  Ordering by filling out a form is optional at this less-busy Chandler location (whereas required at the busier Phoenix location), but is a key piece of the experience.  
Snickerdoodle cookies are the default dessert."}
{"text":"Food was hot, spicy and delicious. Everyone one was nice and willing to help. This was not my first time visiting here and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"Somethings are just wrong. Imagine a college kids fridge with left over Chinese and some tortillas. I love Chinese, I love Mexican. Cheese and General Tso chicken. Ick."}
{"text":"I really don't care for this place, at all, and was dragged here twice by a friend who loved it.

The whole restaurant is large and empty with no decor. It's like an enlarged tin shed. 
The menu is confusing. 
The girl working talks to you like you're stupid if you don't get or like how the menu works. She couldn't fathom that I just wanted my food plain. \"Are you sure? You get it in a taco or a burrito if you want!\"  But chica,I DON'T want. I am here against my will and I just want normal Chinese or Jamaican food, not some weird bastard child they had with a Mexican.

The whole concept to me is like what I do when I have random leftovers in my fridge and tortillas; make burritos out of the leftovers. It's not something I would pay for. Maybe that's personal, but I find jerk chicken does not go in a tortilla well.

The food is either bland or so hot you can't taste anything else. The second time, it made me extremely sick in my nether regions for the whole afternoon. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Luv this place!  I come here every time I'm in Phoenix. Can never decide - everything is great!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Totally lived up to its billing.  Such a great menu, fantastic combo of flavors and cuisines.  Decor is divey as it should be.  Food quality and taste were 10/10.

Get the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. This place can be a bit overwhelming for your first time fortunately we had Ann understanding staff member help us figure it out. Definitely coming back to try out more combinations! Thanks Chino Bandino for serving up some original dishes!"}
{"text":"We have been going here since it was newly opened with two tiny tables behind a single storefront.  (Look at them now! ) We raised our children on this food and love from Frank and Eve. Our kids' picture is on the Chino kids board.  My eldest got her first job here.  My kids take all of their friends and crave it when they come home from their travels. 

WTH happened to this place? 

We called in a takee outee order. The food we took home was missing ordered items.  The food we took home was dried out and unpalatable.  We're very sad"}
{"text":"Initially thought the concept of Chinese-Mexican food was kind of gross but I was extremely mistaken!  The jade chicken is delicious...it's pretty much sweet and sour chicken but with something extra.  And the beans with pork fried rice is an awesome combination.  This all with a $3 beer....que bueno!  Hen hao!

To top the dining experience, the freshly-baked snickerdoodles are divine!  Every inch of dough is covered with cinammon and sugar."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Gem! Love this place. Try the jade chicken and carnitas with jerk rice. And the snickerdoodles will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Wow, not what I expected from a place that had some great reviews. Where do I begin, so the ordering was a nightmare, then the so call dining area, it was like entering a local community meeting room. Pressing on, the food I ordered came in a tin pie plate container. The actual food was OK, but seriously, I will not return to this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. I had the #7 & #6 with black beans and pork fried rice. My wife had the Chicken Diablo & the Jerk Chicken with black beans and regular rice. Mom had the Vegetarian Queso with black beans. It started off by my Mother asking \"Did anyone else get the black bean?\" I said, \"Why are they stone cold?\" All of our meals were barley warm at all. I don't know what the big deal is about this place. The parking lot was empty, the lighting was atrocious, and they strip mall area disserted. That should have been a sign (turn around and go somewhere else). The only reason that I gave them 1 Star is because I could not select 0 Stars! The Chocolate Cookie that came with the meal was the \"HIGHLIGHT\" of the night. Super soft, moist, and yummy. Very good cookie. Obviously it was bought/made somewhere else. This is by far the worst meal that I have had in sometime; so long I can't even remember having a meal this bad. The staff was nice and polite. They were somewhat helpful in trying to order. That in itself is a joke if you don't know what to expect."}
{"text":"Interesting  fusion concept.  I love Mexican and Chinese, so it was a no-brainer when I learned of this please via Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" show.  It's been a few months since I tried, but I highly recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why peeps like this.  I just think it's sooooooo weird.  i like the concept and i like that they give you tastings.  but overall, the food is meh AND it's kinda cold and lacks atmosphere.  but i guess it would be a haven for vegetarians and people who like soy."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! We drove down from Northern California and had to try this place after seeing all the reviews on Yelp.

We were obviously not familiar with the menu but the staff were helpful and nice. We were given a shmorgasboard of items to try.. All of their most popular items. WE loved it.. 

We ate in the dining room and had jerk chicken fried rice, pulled pork, some kind of chicken i cant remember the name of and a black beans. 

I have never had anything like this before and I am completely amazed by the flavor and spice... wow"}
{"text":"So people say ya.. chino bandidi is kind of sketchy.. it is not a date place.. it is UNIQUE. And i didnt believe it.

I was kind of put off guard by how it was.. with the raving reviews i expected an exrrnisve fusion menu and sit down style eating. But no... and i wasnt upset. 

Basically you come to chino for a bowl.. choose your beans.. choose the type of rice and the meat. If you arent sure about the meat, they will let you try it and give you tips. And you will not be upset. Best part you get two helpings of meat and if you want you can quesadilla style it! What what!!

I really did live this place and completely agree... it is UNIQUELY SKETCHY BUT AMAZING"}
{"text":"Come to Chino Bandido's with an open mind. It's a fusion between Mexican and Chinese (street) food. 

A friend and I shared the 2 item combo plate. I know what you're thinking, food combo? Trust me, it's not a combo like Panda Express. It's one of the few places, I'd recommend doing a combo where it works! 

We selected the Jade Chicken Red in a quesadilla and the Emerald Chicken. On the side we also got the Jerk fried rice and Black beans. I can see why the Jade Chicken red is the most popular dish! It's sweet, tasty, and makes you  keep coming back for more! And they gave us two cookies even though we only purchased 1 plate! So we got to taste the snickerdoodle and volcano chocolate cookie. Total came out to be $8.73 w/ tax. Pretty sweet deal!

It's one the Phoenix Area's better cheap eats! We also came at 8:40p (20 mins before closing) and we even got to eat there for an hour after they closed. If this place was closer to my school, I could see myself eating here everyday! 

From their website: 
\"My name is Pancho Panda. I was too big to fit through the door, so they had to tear out the wall to put me inside, then rebuild the wall. I like my job, and I will be pleased if you touch me, pat me, and rub me for good luck! I feel right at home because I am near the Great Wall of Chino! \" ~Mexican Panda"}
{"text":"Worth the experience. They offer unique combination of flavors (and cultures). The black beans are addictive and are what link all of the other items together. I am a fan of jerk fried rice, emerald chicken quesadilla, and jade chicken. During the meal, I always think, this isn't that special, but by the end, the tin is clean and within a week later, I am craving it again. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love love love the food here! But I do like the chandler location better than the Phoenix. It seems roomier and cashiers are always helpful."}
{"text":"Any place that gives free samples of their food = a win in my book! Plus, this place has a great combination of food! MmMmm I highly suggest the jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. =D"}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners dropped in to Chino Bandito on 19th Ave. 

Among Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives Chino Bandito is a Dive. It is somewhat south of casual. All food is ordered at the front counter after marking a piece of paper and handing it in. There is no wait staff. 

Whatever you order is given to you picnic-style in foil containers. You get a napkin, steyrofoam cup, and small plastic utensils. The ambiance is just okay. The place could definately use redecorating; but it is clean. 

Mom had the Teriyaki chicken bowl, both my sister and aunt ordered the Emerald Chicken. I had a vegan burrito with rice, black beans, and veggies. The people at the front counter were very kind and patient taking my order and making sure that I had a very delicious vegan burrito. 

The saving Grace of this place is that the food is pretty good. It was delicious and well flavored. My mom and my aunt didn't have enough sauce on the Teriyaki or their Emerald chicken. I went to the front counter and they gave me containers of sauce.Issue resolved. 

If you're looking for a sit-down meal with your family where you want to be waited on, this is not the place for you. If you'd like just a complete do it yourself, in and out place with a decent price, and good food - this is the place for you. 

The Jolly Diners rated Chino Bandido at a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Such a cool idea. The menu is very confusing for ordering especially  if its your first time. The combinations  are bizarre  but good."}
{"text":"Came here with a group from church. The restaurant seemed busy, but not very.

For lunch, I didn't really want to eat a lot, so I ordered Emerald Chicken W/ rice and a simple black bean burrito.
The other people from my church group ordered before and after me. They all got their dishes, but I had yet to receive mine. My boyfriend had to walk up to the cashier and ask where our food was and why it was 
taking so long. Once we received it, it was room temperature to almost cold. 

Honestly, the employees lack any type of order placement and timing. Giving cold food to customers that is not even cooked, IE chicken is a health code violation. None of the food appeared cooked. The burrito wasn't hot with melty cheese and the Emerald Chicken was cold and rice was cold.

I would not recommend this place. Unskilled employees who can't cook or even warm up a dish. Overly greasy and poor customer service."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place is so overrated.  I even came here twice to try and trick myself into liking it.  The food is nasty, really!  Mexican food cooked with the mystery asian meat....Is it chicken, horse, or cat?

Who knows really.  The food has a very bland taste, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service too! The ginger and onion chicken and the emerald chicken are must haves! The snicker doodle cookie is just like the cherry on top."}
{"text":"You pull up and find yourself parking in a strip mall.. you open the door expecting to be seated, but instead you are looking at a poster of Guy Fieri from DDD. You are then politely greeted and asked if this if your first time here. Then you're given samples different dishes... the jade red chicken is awesome.. free refills at the soda fountain... You wait for your food in anticipation in a simple open dining area. I sat at the table next to the Chino Bandito.. ariba! ariba!  The sugar cookie surprise topped off the very nice experience.

I give this place a 3.8!"}
{"text":"Blah and dirty. Eating inside I feel like I'm on the streets of Mexico because of the cheap plastic chairs and dirty environment. I don't see what the hype is about this place. The ordering system is quirky and irritating. The food is an odd mix and I don't care for  it."}
{"text":"The food was ready in a record time. The portions were however very small and I was not crazy about the taste. The chicken terryaki did not seem to be cooked enough and we were not impressed by the sauce. The emerald chicken sauce was separate and you had to mix it yourself. Overall all it looked like boiled chicken."}
{"text":"Ever wonder what would happen if a nice Mexican girl and a nice Chinese boy got married and opened a restaurant? Chino Bandido is a place that is a great idea and pretty darn good!

So here is the rub:  it is Mexican food with Chinese influences.  The one that got me in the door \"General Tso's Chicken Burrito\".  Think about it.  Think about it... gotcha.  Something you definitely want to try.

As a newbie, the super nice woman behind the counter let me taste a bunch of different meats before I had to decide.  The emerald chicken, which everyone seems to like, is quite good.  Probably the most Chinese style meat there.  It is like chimichurra or a salty, green onion sliced chicken.  I can't decide which.

However, I am delighted to say I stayed for the General Tso's Chicken burrito.  They call it Jade Red Chicken.  Get it in a burrito.  Get it in a quesadilla.  Get it over rice.  Get it in a large pile.  Just get it.  Great stuff.  (see menu:  http://www.chinobandido.com/ordermenu.html)

Now, this is NOT authentic anything.  This is a perfectly nice family pushing a cool, original fusion style of cooking.  If for no other reason, that is worth checking out.  But even better - the food is good.  Enjoy it!

...and just one second.  I almost forgot to mention the 2nd tastiest, most random thing you would expect from a place like this:  Snickerdoodles.  Yes, the sugary, Cinnamon swirled cookies.  Not sure why they do it, but this place has EXCELLENT snickerdoodles.  Go for those too.

And hey, say hi to the Panda with the sombrero for me:  http://www.chinobandido.com/images/The%20Three%20Bears.jpg"}
{"text":"This place really is a dive. You're greeted by Gay Fieri's picture at the front door just to remind you how it is a dive. We waited in a long line to order at the left counter, we filled out our order sheets only to find out that it was the line for help ordering and tasting different menu options. If you want to order, you can bypass this line and go to the ordering line. I wouldn't have been offended had I known this line was sampling but I waited for literally 10 minutes while some fat, white trash family tasted everything and then walked out without ordering. Hmmmmmmm free meal for them! To find out I could have skipped that line, I was pissed.

The \"burrito\" I ordered was the smallest damn thing I have ever seen. Get 2-3 of them if you are hungry. The tortilla was delicious, the filling in it was awesome, but the portions were so amall for $3 I felt a little screwed.

I went and tried it and it was slightly better than average. It's too much a kitschy tourist trap."}
{"text":"Never been to anywhere like this place, one of its kind, Chinese/Mexican? Orange chicken burrito? Nonetheless, I enjoyed the meal here because it was so unique. I loved the black beans, went really well with the jerk rice. DO IT."}
{"text":"This was my fault since I hyped it up too much.  I ordered the carnitas burrito and jade red chicken with the jerk fried rice.  She ordered the bbq pork with jerk fried rice.  It was underwhelming.  But there were tons of cats so they are doing something right."}
{"text":"Been here a million times... will be back a million more.  Great food... divey, so don't expect great ambiance.  Extremely affordable!  Can't go wrong with any dish."}
{"text":"They have great food! Perfect blend of holy matrimony is what I'm told. I always order jade chicken with a Chile reino hope I spelled that right... But they user the huge Chiles not the tiny jalapeno like huge ! It hangs over your plate! God this place is good, and considering I don't really like Mexican food that says alot. Oh and I have a really bad cinnamon allergy so they were super nice and substituted the snicker doodle cookie for me  ;-)"}
{"text":"You would think chinese+mexican fusion is gross, but in reality it's like a fiesta on the great wall of china in your mouth.

My personal favorite is the jade red chicken, gringo chicken on jerk fried rice w/ black beans combo. The portions are huge, the food is probably extremely fattening, and you *WILL* have a food coma by the end of lunch.

To top things off, they give you a cookie. All for $8. 

Hands down my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Been here like two times by force.  For some odd reason my coworkers love this joint.  For me I'm not sure what the heck I'm eating. 

The parking is horrible, good luck finding a spot, and the restaurant both time was horribly crowded and messy.  It looks busted at best.  Quite shocking how busy they are.  The staff however was always friendly and helpful and kind.  

The food here is confusing, what the heck am I eating.  The jerk chicken rice or whatever... gross, how could you mess up rice? It was like dried but not dried, kinda like white rice, but not white....Gross.  The Jade chicken was tasty in an orange chicken kinda way, but still quite odd and very dry and hard, like they deep fried it too long or left it out for a few good hours.  See it's so confusing, I can't even describe it.  

Honestly I won't be back even by force.  On a good note, the soda was tasty.  Good soda, decent quality stuff.  3 stars only because my coworkers say so.  If it was up to me, 2 stars at best.  Deuces!"}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place! Quite a dive in terms of decor, so don't expect anything fancy. There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly.

Anyway, I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD. The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it. They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!). So before you knock it, if you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!"}
{"text":"Waited 35 mins for partly wrong order, red jade chicken was over cooked. Had a full restaurant of waiting people. Somethings going wrong in that kitchen. Equivalent to fast food except for the wait. Should've went to original in PHX."}
{"text":"We are a divided family on this one. Husband likes it. Wife--not so much. Wife is writing this review. Our favorite is their egg foo young and Snickerdoodle cookies. Sometimes it's good; sometimes is sucks--cookies included. Check take-out orders carefully. Not always correct. I usually recommend eating here when I'm not hungry."}

Decor = F
Food = A-
Overall = C

Not street visible, you have to turn into the Walgreen's and drive through the parking lot past the store and turn left when you see the Wide Shoe store. GPS and Mapquest did not provide very accurate directions...

The staff was all young but friendly. I was with a few friends who, like myself, had never been there before and another group of people had come in just a minute or so before us. One of the youngins behind the counter was giving us all lessons in ordering and giving us samples of their most popular menu items.

The decor was odd. Exposed duct work, cheap collapsible tables. The kind my parents own but keep in the shed until we have a a big party. Menu items typed on sheets of paper, laminated and stapled to the wall...it just seemed so hole in the wall, so...ugh

The food was, as my friend called it, \"stoner food\". I got the pork carnitas quesadilla and the jade chicken with black beans and chicken fried rice.
It was all really good! Flavorful, tender.....mmmmmmmmmmmm. My only complaint was that the beans tasted like they had been thrown in the blender instead of hand mashed. No texture
I'm looking forward to a return trip. The items I gave F's to are not going to keep me from coming back! I am already planning on what to eat next.

Oh and that volcano cookie is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Look, there are 1200+ reviews of this place, and oddly I don't have one. We don't go a lot, but we do go. I have friends that live 25 miles away that always stop there when they are in the area. My friend's mom and dad live 20 miles away and occasionally trek out to the place because it's THAT GOOD. No, you can't order snickerdoodles by the dozen if it is late on a weekend...that's a downer because they are delish. IF you are a newbie to Chino's DON'T go during a lunch or dinner rush, you will be overwhelmed by the the ordering process and people might stick their phone in your back as they tweet about your ordering incompetence. I don't know if that has ever happened, but it might. After a few visits you'll feel confident enough to mark the order pad yourself and might even try things like adding a \"q\" or a \"b\" to the order and you'll know what thinks like JFR mean...it'll open up whole new worlds of food possibilities for you, I promise. If you are an adventurous eater, try to Jerk your whole combo. Jerk Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice. If yer a bit wild, but a bit more sane - go with something like Jerk Chicken and normal rice. We've pretty much run the whole gamut of flavors here and we haven't found anything you can go wrong with. I mean, it's Mexican/Asian fusion cuisine with tasty cookie included as you dine in! What's not to like? They also have a sample bar so you can explore the flavor palate as you stand in line (again - not during rush hour, not gonna be conducive to that at all). Just go. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because the ordering system is something no average diner catches onto immediately, it takes a few tries."}
{"text":"Had the jade red chicken and emerald chicken in a quesadilla with beans and rice.  Tasty and very filling. They are generous with portions. A very filling meal w/drink for under $10. 

The food did not blow me away, but its good and the service is very friendly and efficient. As soon as I walked in, the guy at the counter asked if it was my first time and since it was, he offered me samples of everything on the menu and walked me through recommendations and how to order. 

4 stars for the great service and unique take on Chinese/Jamaican/Mexican fusion."}
{"text":"After reading through other reviews to see if my experience was a freak accident or not,... I see that DD&D might have gotten this one wrong. My boyfriend was excited to share this place with me, and has brought friends here in the past with great experiences. Ours, however, was not.  
We went on a Saturday evening and they were already out of about half of the options (including the cookies). The food was ok, and nobody was sick later (hence the one star). The floor was filthy, Seriously, the worst part was when we were told they were closing, sodas were shut down, and we were basically escorted out.  Getting belted in the parking lot, we noticed that the official smoke break began almost precisely 30 seconds after the doors were locked.  Obviously their paying customers are their priority.  
Hopefully the owners see these reviews and return to the good food that DD&D and my friend expect and have raved about.  What I experienced?.....nah."}
{"text":"Erik T. got it right! http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:FCdSMSCmoG-PUwvK4m0osg

I won't repeat his comments, but he is spot on.

My partner and I set out for a Friday evening meal and I let him choose. A few weeks back he saw Chino Bandido featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Well, Chino is definitely a dive, but he really wanted to try it. What a mistake.

The best thing about Chino Bandido is the friendly service. After that it is all down hill. The place is downright filthy, the food isn't very good and the atmosphere is sorely lacking. 

Of the two of us my partner is a very forgiving, easy-going guy. I, on the other hand, am at the other end of the spectrum and am very picky. For him to make the following comments tells me this place really is very bad:
1) This place is really dirty
2) The food is awful
3) I won't be coming back
4) Hurry up and eat, I want to get out of here

To sum it all up, if you want to eat bad food in a filthy dirty restaurant and wait forever for your food (it took ours over 20 minutes) at least you'll get friendly service.

Don't say I didn't warn you. Read Erik T's review!"}
{"text":"Jamaican, Mexican Chinese food are you kidding me?  Somehow it all works.  

It's quirky and fun although a bit confusing at first but they are patient, friendly and helpful.   If you can't decide what you want they will let you taste before you get in line to order.   I tasted the jerk chicken which was excellent.  I was in a mexican mood so I went with carnitas and machaca which was good and fresh but  a bit plain for me.  I got the impression from everyone else at the table that chinese was the way to go.

The snickerdoodles cookie served with every order is a nice touch. 

Prices are really reasonable -great for lunch!

{"text":"Love it!  Where else can you get mexican-chinese-Jamaican fusion?  Jade Red Chicken quesadilla, is always a great choice."}
{"text":"As I gazed enviously at Guy Fieri shoveling in piles of freshly fried Chinese chicken and steaming hot beans and rice on Triple D, I knew I was sold on this place.  Traditionally, I haven't been the biggest fan of fusion cuisine.  However, there was something ultra-unique about the way Chino Bandido combined the culinary powerhouses of Latin, Asian, and Caribbean cuisine in a low-key, honest kind of way.  They don't try to alter recipes from each respective culture; rather, they simply make the recipes in their true form, and serve them alongside other ethnic cuisines.  So instead of coming up with some Frankenstein Mexican flavored orange chicken crud, they make bomb Chinese food, bomb Latin food, and bomb Caribbean food, and let you decide how you want to combine those dishes to make your meal.  

The restaurant is located in a tired-looking strip mall in suburban north Phoenix.  The sign on the outside of the restaurant matter-of-factly states \"Mexican Chinese Combos\" as if it's something that is rather common.  Upon entrance, there is a gentleman off to the left behind a food station giving out samples of whatever menu item you wish to try.  Straight ahead is an open kitchen bustling with clanging woks and loud sizzling.  Off to the right, there are two rooms full of tables, a self-serve soda fountain, and a super cool panda statue wearing a sombrero.  

I ordered a two item combo with the jade red chicken, pollo diablo, Cuban black beans, and jerk fried rice.  The jade red chicken comes in bite-sized, ultra crispy pieces smothered in a savory-sweet, tangy sauce.  The chicken is not all uniformly shaped like some Panda Express frozen takeout.  You can tell this chicken was cut by hand and freshly fried to a perfect crisp just for you.  The pollo diablo comes with a finely ground sprinkle of fresh chiles, and it has a very bright, clean jalepeno/serrano flavor.  The beans are well-seasoned with deep, earthy Latin spices, and the jerk fried rice is decidedly Caribbean, with fresh chopped green onions generously mixed throughout.  Bites of crispy, tangy chicken are perfectly countered with rich, creamy black beans covered in grated Mexican cheese.  The chicken is not oily or overly greasy at all.  I was also able to try the chile relleno, which is another must-order for me.  I would recommend the relleno for people who love fried foods, but I would advise against ordering it if you're fried-averse.  The relleno is essentially a huge green chili stuffed (I mean STUFFED) with melty cheese, dipped in a thick, crispy batter, and fried to a crisp.  It's about the size of a Pringles can, and it can probably feed the entire Cardinals offensive line.  

A self-serve soda fountain, great customer service, and plenty of seating guarantee a stellar experience here.  I was a bit curious why all the meals are served in a take-out style aluminum bowl, but after eating here I now know why.  Let's just say you won't leave hungry.  Chino Bandido, you are probably my favorite restaurant on earth.  Open a location in LA please!"}
{"text":"Worst.... Diarrhea.... Ever....

I ate at Chino Bandido's for the first and last time ever. I got the jade chicken, diablo chicken, black beans and rice. Was not impressed at all. The jade chicken was alright. The diablo chicken had an overpowering garlic flavor, and the chicken was super dry and hard. 

I don't understand the hype about this place. I'd rather have regular Chinese food, or authentic Mexican-- good concept of combining the two, but just doesn't work. 

I know that Chino Bandido is what upset my stomach, because it was the only thing I had to eat that day. 

If you want good Chinese food go to Shangri-La on 28th Ave and Cactus. 
And if you want mind blowing Mexican go to Valle Luna at 35th and Bell Rd."}
{"text":"A fusion of Mexican cuisine meets Chinese cuisine and the result is?  Read on to find out my thoughts!

Location & Aesthetics -- located just away from the corner of N 19th Ave and Greenway Road in a small strip mall area.   
Not too difficult to locate (good signage).
Lots of available parking in front of the business though parking is shared with other nearby businesses.  Parking lot can be little dark for some with minimal lighting.  
Interior -- as you enter, to the left is your order area, and to the right is your dining room area with another dining off the first one.
Dining rooms and order area was very clean, and was spacious enough to accommodate a small party as ours.  It seemed the dining areas can accommodate families of any size.  Seating was comfortable with tables being very clean, and adequate lighting.
Noise level was okay with the dinner crowd present.

Service -- staff were warm, friendly, and helpful.  Since this was my first time there, they were very patient to answer the plethora of questions I had about the menu and how to order.
After order, our meals promptly arrived at our tables.  What's even cool is that the server will ask if your order is correct and they're willing to take it back and correct it if it isn't with no fuss and, most importantly, no funny face either.

Menu -- up on the wall and very visible (with photos) plus there is an order form to help you speed up the order process when you get to the cashier.  The order form was comprehensive and self-explanatory.  

Food -- very very delicious!  I had the number 7 -- the lightly coated, deep-fried chicken glazed with slightly spicy sweet sauce with the jerk rice and the refried beans (2-item combo).
The spice level on the rice and chicken was appropriate and not overpowering.
The refried bean was not runny but had the consistency of oatmeal which, for me, is just right.
The portion sizes were good too and much appreciated because it was just filling enough, and I didn't feel overstuffed!

I think for the prices and the great tasting food, plus the added variety of the dishes, I will be back!

A must recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Listen, you have to suspend a little bit of disbelief to enjoy Chino, OK? 

It's not the most stylish or the cleanest looking restaurant you've ever seen. The tables are the same portable kind that you'd register to vote on or lay out your wares at a yard sale and the chairs are like a school cafeteria. You pour your own drinks at the fountain and the napkins are in a wall-mounted dispenser and you pick up your plastic utensils from a bin next to the drink lids and condiment packets. All of the above fits the neighborhood at 19th Ave & Greenway perfectly. There's a trailer park across the street, just south of a horse racing track, know what I'm sayin? 

Enjoy the taste of your food despite your surroundings, right?

Imagine combining the greatest hits of what most Americans know of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican cuisines, make it affordable along with totally customizable and that's the essence of the concept at Chino. 

I really, really, really like it. I think it is perfectly unpretentious and works great as:

+a lunch stop with co-workers
+a takeout joint at the end of a busy day
+a family restaurant
+a place where you know there'll be something for everyone
+a hangover cure

They make one of the greatest snickerdoodles in the world, too.

You will be overwhelmed your first visit, so take your time (seriously, ten or 15 minutes) and ask for a sample of whatever you're considering."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it had its original location. Love the jade red chicken quesadilla!"}
{"text":"This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal."}
{"text":"Service: 
below average probably because they are sick of people trying to figure out this weird fusion but still not a great reason to be rude. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. 

Seating area:
Clean with lots of seating even if it is practically picnic tables and and lawn chairs.

Food:
Really can't complain to much. Won't wow you by any means but great to have both Spanish and Asian foods in one plate"}
{"text":"This place is crazy fire!! My coworker talked about this place so much that I just had to try it out for myself. We decided to grab a bite here for lunch after work. It was my first time here. I was overwhelmed by the many different options to choose from & how to place my order. Luckily, there is an employee who was behind the counter to the left who assisted me & let me sample some of the different options they had to choose from!

I ended up going with jerk fried rice with pollo Diablo & jade chicken! With no beans. The fried rice alone was killer. It was so good!! Very flavorful, not too oily. & had little chunks of jerk chicken in there. I could eat that all day. The pollo Diablo wasn't as hot as I expected it to be. For me it was more of a mild spice. Deep fried chunks of breaded chicken & stir fried in LOTS of garlic & spices. Slightly oily, very garlicky but so damn good! & the jade chicken is a classic. Not too sweet. Perfect pair with the rice & pollo Diablo. 

To top off this meal, they make a mean snickerdoodle. When the guy handed it to me, it was still nice and warm. Soft and chewy on the inside, nice and crunchy on the outside! Just the way I like my cookies!!"}
{"text":"One word to sum this place up: YUCK!
My husband and I recently moved to Chandler and this place was referred to us by a friend.  When I first entered the place, I noticed the lack of ambiance.  The plastic tables and chairs did not help.  If you are new to Chino Bandido, they have you try several samples of their food, which was a nice touch on a so far lack-luster impression.  I decided on the Jade Red Chicken.  I was served my order but I wanted to wait for my husband to be served his before digging in.  We waited about 15 minutes and his order never came out so he went up to the counter to ask about it.  Apparently they forgot to put his order in.  By the time his order came out, mine was cold.  I took a bite from my chicken, and was confused so I inspected the piece further.  It was dark and did not taste like chicken. I tried a few more pieces and discovered the same thing.  I brought my order up to the counter and had the staff verify that it was chicken.  I'm still not convinced it was chicken.  To make the experience worse, I noticed one of the workers taking a few bites from a customer's order before bringing it out to them.  They were still chewing the food when they served the customer. Gross!"}
{"text":"Overrated.   Plus they are so full of it that they don't think they need a sign on Chandler Avenue.  And because if no sign I forget its tucked away in the corner.    Anyways been there twice in the last 6 months and not impressed - more of a novelty for me than anything."}
{"text":"Always fresh, away delicious, many options to try. Each dish hand crafted and served by skilled artisans. Be forewarned: Once you try Chino, you will crave it for months on end."}
{"text":"This is a unique eating experience.  Their menu is very unique.  Our family has diverse eating preferences and Chino's has something for all of us.  They have been careful to stay in this same location for over 20 years although their place is always busy.  I love the Jade Red, my wife loves the quesadilla and our youngest son loves the jerk chicken because it is spicy.

You gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great value!  The food is tasty and the service is awesome.  Portion size is very generous.  My only gripe is that the dining room is less clean than I would like.  If it were cleaner I'd give this place 5 stars.  Great place for lunch or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Just being on TV doesn't mean it's good. Place was dirty, food was bland, and prices were extreme for a taco joint. Oh, did I mention it's next to a head shop and meth heads outside beg for your change?"}
{"text":"I can not remember how I found out about this restaurant but it sounded different and interesting. First of all, good luck finding this restaurant. It is tucked way back off the road (Chandler Blvd). We actually drove right past it once and circled back and found it. The nearest main cross road is Dobson. The restaurant sits back (remember- way back) on the south side of Chandler Blvd. Do yourself a favor, google map it before you head here. Also, park in the back. There is a lot of parking in the back which is actually the east side of the restaurant. We parked in the front  We got here on a Thursday afternoon about 1230pm and it was not busy. There were 3 tables of people. There are a lot of tables, and according to some reviews it gets very busy. Don't get me wrong, I am glad it wasn't busy but it does make you kinda go hmmm when it's lunch time and not many people are at a restaurant. I had reviewed the order system with my friend prior to going to the restaurant so he was prepared for the extraordinary ordering system. Here's my beef with this-there is no way to know where to start or who to turn in your final exam of an order to. Remember it wasn't busy, so maybe the person staring out into space behind the counter could have said something BEFORE we had to ask. It's not like he was busy. I ordered a combo of egg foo yung, jerk fried rice, black beans, and a chile relleno burrito. My friend ordered a combo with a jerk chicken quesadilla, a chinese BBQ pork quesidilla, refried beans and jerk fried rice. We were handed our cups for our drinks and off we went. We had no idea where the drink station was because you can not see it from the order counter. To the left of the order counter, and down a bit is the drink/silverware/napkins/salsa/asian sauce and to-go covers. We took a seat and about 10 minutes later our food was delivered to us. They even deliver a cookie with each order. I don't know if they change the kind of cookie from day to day but that day the cookie was a snickerdoodle. The food is very good. It's kind of cool to be able to order chinese and mexican food at the same place. My egg foo yung is the darkest I've ever seen, but it was good. The chile relleno was heavenly. The jerk fried rice was moist and tasty. The black beans tasted a lot better than they looked. My friend said both of his quesadillas were good as well. He thought the jerk chicken was just a little better than the chinese bbq. I would have given this restaurant only 3 stars due to the lack of customer service.  The good food gets the 4. The food is not overpriced which could almost bring this to a 5 star review. In this economy a place to grab some great food at a very reasonable cost is much appreciated. Our combos were about $7.50 each with the drinks costing $1.50. Pet peeve about the place- the employees constantly went in and out of the kitchen. CONSTANTLY. I don't know where they were going but since we were sitting just to the right of the kitchen we were acutely aware of how many times the door open. It makes me worry about the whole handwashing thing prior to working with food.  Don't go here looking for ambience as there is none. You will sit at tables looking at a parking lot. There is a TV on and we watched some opening day baseball. This is not a first  date night kind of place, but more a hang with your friends kind of place  Chino Bandido is comfortable, and roomy. Groups would easily be seated here. The food is the star! . Remember B is for burrrito, and Q is for quesadila :)"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled - this place is not a fusion of cuisines.  You get a combo plate of Chinese and Mexican.  I had the jade red chicken and fried rice (Chinese) with the black beans and quesadilla (Mexican).  The food was good but you can get better anywhere."}
{"text":"Totally awesome! Seriously, you gotta try this place. You don't HAVE to mix things, but it is definitely encouraged: Jade and red chicken with jerk fried rice is like sticking your toes in the water. Don't forget your cookie for dessert (or later!).

Once you fall in love with this place and want to try something different, order an egg foo yung quesadilla."}
{"text":"I think my friends are going to hate me for this rating....but I have to be true to myself.
Three trusted elites in Louisville, when they found out we would be in Phoenix for a week, they all but insisted that we eat at Chino Bandido.
First, how HOW did none of my friends tell me what the food was like? I honestly thought we were going to be going to get tacos until we were on our way to the place and we were so hungry, we started looking at the menu before we got there (I don't normally peep the menus ahead of time). 
The Mexican-Chinese mixture is an interesting one. The amount of food you get for the money is CRAZY. At least two people could share a combo and be more than satisfied. I think it just wasn't my cup of tea.
I got a combo with the Chinese bbq pork and the carnitas (in a quesadilla) with pork fried rice and beans. I absolutely devoured it, primarily because we had climbed Camelback that afternoon. But it just didn't wow me like I hoped it would, having heard my friends rave about it. It all tasted fine separately, I'm just not sure it all works together.
The staff was friendly and helpful when telling us first timers how to order and how it all works. Overall it was a decent visit.

It is an interesting concept, that many think is well-executed. If I was back in the area and was asked to go back, I wouldn't say no. But I personally wouldn't suggest it myself."}
{"text":"A lot of food for the money! Defiantly different but once you try it your either hooked or not for it. It's usually 4/5 people love it and 1 does not"}
{"text":"This place is soo delicious so friendly professional and they are fast too! We don't wait long. And I usually stay and chat until they have to close. Great ambience"}
{"text":"My parents use to take me here as a child and now I take my little one here too and we all love it. I hope to take my grandchildren here one day. Every time we come here we are more that satisfied. It is always amazing. Thank you chino"}
{"text":"I think my expectations for this place was too high. I had tried some samples, like the jerk fried rice, which I thought was bland. But with all the yelp reviews raving about the jerk fried rice, I assumed maybe the sample I was given was just off target but a larger sample of the food would be more flavorful. I was wrong. The jerk fried rice was nothing to brag about it. It tasted like rice with a little bit of spice.

The Jade chicken was actually good and had a nice spiciness to it.  If I were to visit this place again, I would order the Jade chicken again.

I really wanted some vegetables with my meal, like some beef and broccoli, but all they had was shredded lettuce. I was very disappointed and I think all the boring lettuce ruined my meal, worse than the jerk fried rice.

In my opinion, the food here was full of sodium.  I was extremely thirsty after my meal and had a slight headache after leaving here. I'm guessing this place might use MSG. Not good.

I think the thing that tasted the best was the free snicker doodle cookie that came with the meal. That was good.

I was impressed that the cashier area was very high tech because everything was processed on iPads. Unfortunately I would rather be more impressed with the food than how they charge my credit card."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for a delish meal. Excellent Chinese and Mexican food! Two greats even better when combined."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get spicy food. Diablo chicken and rice would be about 8$. I personally wouldn't go back there again. However, I have friend who prefer it to everybody else."}
{"text":"This is my go to take out food. Love the flavors and my food is always ready within 10-15min of ordering to go. Most of the time the food is fresh; however I've ordered a couple of times where it seem the meat wasn't as fresh as I would like. I usually get the two meat combo and love the variety, quesadilla, burrito etc. I haven't tried the burritos but love the Jade chicken quesadilla, it is definitely a must try. My go to are the Jade chicken and Jen pork with jerk fried rice. So yum!!!The order also comes with a cookie which is a great touch."}
{"text":"Holy-Mole did they do a turn-around in the 3 months since I last ate there!  My boss decided to have a group lunch, and thinking that suffering through another boring meal was worth it (a salary-continuation project), I went along.

Placed the order and by the time I got my drink and sat down it was coming out of the kitchen.  The food quality (and quantity) did a 180 since my last visit.  Wondering what happened I flagged down the gal the next time she was motoring by to ask.  Apparently they changed out the kitchen staff, and I think a manager or two were shown the door.  Don't know and really don't care as the food is definitely worth repeat trips."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying we come here everytimewe are in town. We use to drive tothe phx location but this one is closer.   I would have given it 5 stars but the service is sometimes scektchy like they are doing you a favor by taking your order. Regardless we are slaves to their amazing black beans and jade red chicken quessidillas   So we keep coming back.  Often we order by phone as we are driving into town and get it to go thus avoiding the rude servers"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, a Phoenix great. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Jade chicken and machaca combo are my favs, can't get this anywhere else. Pepsi products."}
{"text":"I have been going here off and on over the past 20 years.  I love Chino, I know there are those who do not, but you can't beat having Mexican and Chinese options and mixing them together.  I suggest the combo - get the jerk fried rice - a bit spicy but awesome.  I prefer the black beans, there great.  I have found my combo of meats to be the hengrenade chicken - not too mild, not too hot and I put this in a quesadilla - yes a quesadilla!  I also go with the BBQ pork, its always flavorful and never dried out.  Best part of the combo, is you get a cookie to top it off.  Try the teriyaki sauce, you have to ask for it.  If you can find a negative, it would be the aesthetics, the place itself needs some updating.  But the food - its awesome!"}
{"text":"Gave this place 1 more try... Previous i was bundled into a takeout work order with coworkers and the food seemed mehhhh chinese places should make sure their rice is perfect... 

I tried the Chili Relleno and Jade Chicken W, Chicken Fried Rice. - dont like any kind of beans so got those wrapped to go,

Wife had Machaca n ???? pork fried rice and salad

Food was average, nothing off the hook, but the mix of the cultures made for a good eat.. 

Seriously dont know how Guy Fieri came across this place,, definitely not a place to go out of your way to try.
We will maybe stop by every 3 months or so.."}
{"text":"Chino is one of those places that does not have amazing mexican or asian food but they have manged to make the fusion of the two work. The jade red chicken and jerk chicken are two of my favorites and the chili rellano is serviceable.  I think i will stay away though because about an hour after eating my wife got really sick, not blaming the food but i would rather not take any chances."}
{"text":"It's an interesting mix of opinions posted about Chino Bandito. Frankly on my first visit I wasn't sure what to think. On my next visit I was hooked.  Whenever I find myself near the 17 and Greenway I'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-out.

Chino Bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says. It's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside. But look past it and you'll have some fun. Even though it's kind of funky I did find it to be clean - and I'm extremely finicky about cleanliness.

Some of the menu winners include the #13 Pollo Diablo, which delights with garlic and hot peppers. Besides that the #10 Emerald Chicken has a wonderful flavoring including ginger that is well-teamed with the jerk fried rice. Enjoy the hot sauce and interesting mix of flavors.  I also like the chocolate volcano which is only available on certain days.

Yes it is an odd mix of Mexican, Chinese and Caribbean flavors, but it works. Chino Bandito is VERY inexpensive and highly recommended. Just keep an open mind."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out for the first time today... After watching the food network we had to try it! We got the jerk chicken and the red chicken.. Jerk rice and black beans ... It was sooo good! Everything was super flavorful and cooked perfectly! This is going to be my go to spot from now on! The only thing I would recommend is calling your order in before you go... If your not planning to eat there. They were really busy over the weekend... It's not the \"nicest\" looking place but the food is on POINT! I'll just take mine to go"}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken was just boiled chicken with sauce on it, the BBQ chicken and jerk chicken were super dry. Other than that it was below avg and I don't think ill go back."}
{"text":"Eat here! If you don't know what this place is,  it doesn't matter.  You will not regret eating anything you order off the menu! My personal favorite is the carnitas."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The young lady helping us let us sample whatever we wanted off the menu. She helped us fill out our order form. I ordered the Jade Red Chicken bowl with Jerk fried rice. It was so good. It got pretty spicy."}
{"text":"Sweet and simple. This place looks like hell, but the food is AMAZING. Great service and if you have never been you can sample all kinds of things before you order."}
{"text":"I was kidnapped and taken here by my boyfriend who thought I'd turn it down if he suggested it. I was skeptical walking in (not a lot in terms of atmosphere), but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very helpful and brought over a bunch of samples for us to try. I ended up going with the plate with carnitas, and machaca in a burrito, jerk fried rice, and black beans. It was a lot of food and everything was packed with flavor. Definitely not a light, healthy meal, so I probably won't go often, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I hated this.  I nearly got lynched for saying so.  This place came highly recommended (by not only Food Network's Guy Fieri of DDD but ALL our friends) and everyone swears we must've just hit it on an \"off\" night...but it was completely abysmal!  

I had the teriyaki chicken, carnitas pork, black beans, and jerk fried rice.  Hubby had egg foo young and some kind of burrito.  Honestly, it was like the bastard offspring of the crappiest TV dinner we've ever had.  ALL of the food had the exact same flavor and texture (uber-salty, flavorless, mush).  

The restaurant was packed and dirty; they didn't bother to wipe down tables as customers vacated.  Also, they got annoyed and curt with you if you showed up at the register and do not have an order card filled out, as though you're supposed to automatically know they have a special ordering system.  

Maybe they stopped making quality food when they learned they could ride on the notoriety the TV exposure got them...or maybe we did just hit it on a bad night.  Either way, we won't be back."}
{"text":"CBTO has unique, tasty food, low prices, a dumpy setting and a blend of happy friendly / apathetic employees.  The jerk chicken is delicious!  Get your meal to go and you won't care how ghetto the dining room looks."}
{"text":"Chino is one of those places that I grew up eating.  It seems like it has been here forever and we used to order takeout from them when I was just a little kid.  There was a long period in between that I grew up, found other places to eat, moved away, and just plain forgot about this place.  Now, working right down the street, I've always intended to go back.  I finally did and boy did I miss this place.

Of course the ordering style is a bit strange and is the only thing that knocks one star from my review.  I don't understand why I can't just freakin order.  Why do I need to pretend I am ordering sushi when I just want a standard mexican bowl of rice and meat?

I ordered something...red pork or something like that.  I'm not really sure.  I just looked at the menu and picked a number.  It was great.  Spicy, meaty, excellent.  The prices were reasonable and the food was great.  No complaints there.

Sure the place is in a ghetto strip mall (although PoppaMaize next door is killer!) and looks dirty as a barn, but the food is great and you can always do take-out.  Chino is the best fusion in town...I must say.  They are all about the spicy and that is what I like."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said the service is excellent. They very patiently help me make a decision of what I wanted to eat, letting me try samples of different things. I hate to say this because it seems like such a good idea but I don't think Asian and Mexican goes together in fact both types of food are wonderfully fine on their own. Mixing them both together and then adding a pound of grease is just not the business. The sauces were really good the rice was ok and that it about it. I did not like the meat in my dish or the flavor. My friend had the chille relleno and got sick soon after. My son wouldn't eat at all caused it looked like dog food especially in the foil bowls they give everyone. I give it three stars because I'm sure there's a meal there that taste good. But for me I just couldn't bring myself to go back and try it again especially because the atmosphere and decor are very depressing and old."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Definetly a unique combination worth trying. The atmosphere is always welcoming. If you have never been then let someone at the ordering station know and they will gladly give you a taste of the most popular items on the menu to let you know what their flavor is about. Their GM Ron is always attentive with his customers and constantly interacting to make sure your experience is a pleasant one."}
{"text":"My friends drug me here one  Saturday before we were to embark on a Girls Night. I was skeptical, especially since we had to take the 101 to get there. Seemed awfully out of the way before a night on the town. Then we arrived. (side eye) I am dressed up why are you dragging me here in my cute shoes. 

Well hell's bells I was pleasantly surprised. Very delicious. and fresh even at 8:45 at night (they close at 9) The cashier was nice, once again they were closing in 15 minutes and there was no hint of attitude. Which is rare. The awesome thing is that you don't have to take a chance on a dish you never tried, how? They offer samples. WHAT? No restaurant offers samples before you order. And to top it off you get a cookie for dessert. Gratis. 

Although for me its kinda out of the way, but the food was good and worth the drive. 

only reason they get 4 starts is because of that huge pic of Guy Fieri on the wall."}
{"text":"Emerald chicken was great. They have a line where you can do taste testing and the price and service were great. The eating area is nothing over the top."}
{"text":"Let me just say, Jade Red Trifecta! That includes Jade red chicken, jade red quisadilla, jade red burrito. To answer your question, No I do not  eat all of this. I do know of a few people that do. If you haven't tried this place you have to. It definitely has some character. Put aside the bad decor and you have got a  one of a kind restaurant. Hopefully you will be there on a volcano cookie day. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I got the combo platter with two options. The Jade Red Chicken and the Chili Relleno with Jerk Fried Rice and beans. The chili was perfectly. Traded and the cheese was perfectly melted and gooey inside. The Jerk fried rice had really great flavor. The Jade Red Chicken was a great Asian influence that was not overwhelmingly greasy like most Chinese foods. I love this place and would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Whoever came up with the idea of Chinese-Mexican fusion food - you are a genius! I repeat, a genius. 

I love this place, it is as close to comfort food as it can get outside of your home. There are a couple of favorites that I end up ordering every time I come here - the Jade Red Chicken = sweet & sour & crunchy & all the goodness packed into every single bite. The jerk fried rice = I'm never going to eat normal fried rice again. 

This place is super unpretentious. The wait staff are always cheerful and the best thing is you can sample the food before you order it and I make it a point to do that every single time! And last but not the least, the cookies they give free with every meal are awesome too :D

If you are in the area, hop over for a quick bite, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First off the Service was excellent the food was also pretty tasty but I should have seen this coming what gives you diarrhea most the time Mexican food or Chinese food so maybe a mix of of two would cancel each other out right well I was wrong if your constipated I recommend the food  it will clear you out  it's not just me I grew up going to tj for tacos and San Diego's taco shops and never got sick but this place did me in maybe it's cause I came in late maybe just a bad batch of chicken I don't know I wont be be back though"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place as I was making a road trip from California to Texas. What a great find!! First look into the place, I was a little confused about what kind of food they served and what to order. I was kindly greeted by one of the cashiers and asked if I would like to try a sample of some of their items. 

Ended up ordering the Chinese Bar-b-q Pork and the Jade Red Chicken.

The Jade Red Chicken was amazing. For those who think that panda express's orange chicken is pretty good, this had the same kind of texture, but bumped it up a notch with their Jade Red sauce. 

The Chinese Bar-b-q Pork was average.

Plus, Guy Fieri has been and recommends this spot!"}
{"text":"So I have been many times and haven't wrote a review so here it goes.

Chino Bandido is ultimate Mexican-Asian fusion with a twist of Caribbean in it.  They have many amazing dishes there I can't say which one I like best.  Plus you get a snickerdoodle cookie with every meal.  

Today I had the machaca and pork fried rice.  The machaca was great not too dry and full of flavor.  The fried rice was very good as well and with the hot sauce they have is nice and spicy.  

If you haven't been to Chino you are missing out."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Delicious!!Even though it has that \"hole in the wall\" look, don't let that stop you from going in. It's some of the best food in town!"}
{"text":"Great food, a strange mix of Chinese and Mexican food. Not great ambiance, but food is good and something a bit different"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for over 5 years and I will keep coming back because the food is really tasty, and the service is quick!

This hole in the wall is the craziest fusion of mexican and chinese food you have ever seen. Jade Red Chicken Burrito?? Jerk Chicken tacos?? Your favorites Pork fried rice and white rice with black beans?! This place is always a conversation when I wear my shirt I bought there with their mascot a cartoon mexican bandit panda. Don't believe me? They have a solid stone version that stands 5 feet tall right in the restaurant. 

You can customize your dishes each time you come in and you aren't sure they have taste dishes so you can see what fusions you want to create. Their dinning area is long tables and family set smaller ones with plenty of chairs to go around. Paintings of Pandas and classic south western style covers the walls. Best part the staff is clean and quick even in the longest lines. And its always busy there.  Great place for families and friends to sit down enjoy food and have a complementary cookie for dessert.

Place is so great I just might go there today for lunch."}
{"text":"Met a f roend here for dinner last night and I was shocked at the gluten free choices they had. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best, the best 'Mexican' food I've had...Was in Phoenix for work and the first time I ever ate 4 times at the same place in a week..."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a couple of Food Network shows and it sounded good so we headed on down to try it out.  Mexican/Chinese combo plates....Im listening!

We walked in and were greeted by a nice lady who asked if we had ever been here before.  We told her no and she had a guy take us over to the \"sample station\".  They give you about 5 different samples of stuff and then show you how to fill out the little card to place your order.

I decided to go with a combo of a jerk chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  My wife went with a plain bean and cheese burrito, and a veggie quesadilla.  You place your order and then grab your drink and sit down and wait for them to bring your food out to your table.  

About 15 minutes later our food came out.  It was awesome!  The jerk chicken quesadilla was bomb!  Its pretty spicy and had a great overall flavor.  The jade red chicken is their specialty and it lived up to the hype.  A couple pieces could have been a bit more moist, but it was really good overall.  Excellent fried rice too.  My wife said her burrito was good, kind of average, just pinto beans and cheese wrapped up.  I took a couple bites of her veggie quesadilla and it was alright.  It had what looked like some nacho cheese in it, where as my jerk chicken quesadilla had shredded cheeses in it.  Good none the less.  The grand finale was a free cookie they bring out.  It was a snickerdoodle type cookie and it had lots of sugar on it and was still a bit warm from the oven.  A perfect end to an awesome meal.

Total damage for everything was $19.00 and change.  The staff was super nice and helpful and if I lived here, I would have this in my regular rotation of places to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to the other Chino Bandido a few years ago.  I saw that this place was within reasonable driving distance from work (4 miles) and since we have hour lunches, I decided to drive down.  I walked in, filled out my card on what I wanted (for those that don't know....Chino Bandido is a fusion cuisine that allows you to mix and match different items.  You fill out a card with a pen and write down what you want...endless combinations are available pretty much)  and then paid the man my money.  A few minutes later, I had my sack of food and was on my way out the door.  Here is what I ordered..................

I went with a 2 item combo and decided to get 2 quesadillas (Jen Red Pork and Jade Red Chicken) black beans and pork fried rice.  The total for this huge monstrosity was $9.10.  Here is how everything tasted.............

Jen Red Pork Quesadilla-  This thing was delicious.  It was pretty much sweet and sour pork wrapped in a tortilla with cheese.  They kind of \"fry/griddle\" their tortillas so they have a bit of a crunch/crisp to them.  They stuffed this to the gills with tons of crunchy/sweet/hot pork.

Jade Red Chicken-  Very similar to the Jen Red Pork except that it was chicken.  Think sweet and sour chicken.  I was very impressed with my 2 quesadilla combo.  It was almost too much though.  I wound up stuffed and couldn't even finish two 1/4s of each quesadilla.

Black Beans-  I'm usually not a fan of beans.  These beans were absolutely delicious though.  They are as black as the night sky and they came covered with a bunch of cheese.  They reminded me of a sort of refried bean but way more delicious.  It was almost like a giant bean dip.  Alternating bites of beans and quesadilla was a killer combo.

Pork Fried Rice-  This was pretty good.  I left a lot of it in the container just because I was so damn full from everything else.  This was a moister fried rice with little pieces of pork in it.  Was it the best fried rice ever?  Nah.  Did it work with the combo of everything else?  Yeah.  

Snickerdoodle-  They hook you up with a cookie for dessert.  The sugar cookie was delicious.  Soft and chewy and sweet.  It was the first cookie I have had in months.

Everything was really tasty!  You could probably split a 2 item combo between 2 people.  I tried my darnedest  to finish everything and didn't even come close.  They definitely hook up the portions!   I will definitely be back to try out more combos.  The choices are endless and the food is delicious.  Service was friendly too.  I'm glad this place is nearby!"}
{"text":"Interesting combination of Chinese and Mexican food but it really works.  Jade Chicken, rice and beans.  I'd recommend giving it a try.  A ton of different choices and combinations."}
{"text":"I'll spare you from having to read more comments about how weird or cool the ethnic combinations are. It's a wonderful concept and I'm sure you all get it by now, so shall we just move along?

To start, the guys behind the counter (upon finding out it's your first time there) will give you a good amount of samples for you to try. I appreciated that.

For the most part, the items were pretty flavorful. And having the option of eating it on its own, in a quesadilla, or a burrito made it that much more fun.

I had the Jade Red Chicken (by itself) and the Chili Relleno in a quesadilla. And on the side, I had chicken fried rice and jerk fried rice. No complaints about any of those things.

If I lived in the area (or less than a 5 hour drive away), I'd eat here every once in a while as my comfort food since I love Chinese and Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been going here for close to 20 years now and always love it. It started out with only a couple tables and has just grown since. If you are going for the first time bring someone who has been (so they can be your Sherpa through the ordering process) it is a bit complicated with the numbers system, or just let them know you have never been and they will guide you/give you some samples to try."}
{"text":"I crave this place more then any other restaurant, guilty pleasure at it finest my friends."}
{"text":"All their menu choices are great,  never had bad food here. Prices have gone up, regretably. .... last time we went, there were less beans than rice, which was disappointing.  Maybe a fluke? We won't stop going, just less frequently due to prices.
According to witness statements, portion sizes have shrunk.  Come on CB, it's beans, rice and chicken. You do wonders with it, but to raise prices and cut portions?  Filiberto 's is about a mile north.... don't make me go there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places always been good food and service every visit and the cookies are to die for"}
{"text":"My 1200th review.... how far I have come..... 

SBCers I have found my paradise and I want to take this place home with me. 

First off...they give you a flavor profile mini taste tour when you come and its your first time. They walk you through mild all the way to their jerk chicken. The guy working the counter last night was super helpful. 

You can tell where the good food is because pork is not the only thing on the menu... as we were finishing our taste testing a dozen cops came in for lunch/ early dinner. It looked like 10 out of the 12 come here frequently and it shows.

I went with the emerald chicken (which was AMAZING), a jade chicken QUESADILLA and the pork fried rice....wait.. I ALSO GET A COOKIE! 

The jade chicken was that perfect sweet and I know it sounds weird but tasted really good in a cheese quesadilla (just that right amount of crispy outside). the emerald chicken was amazingly well balanced.. it was light and fresh... just what I needed after being up since 5 AM and travelling. The pork fried rice was perfect.....my beans took me for a brief moment to my happy place...the snickerdoodle was like the Santa Cruz Pacific Cookie Company was here in Arizona... i waited five minutes and then ate it in the car while going to our time share

The boyfriend got the emerald chicken, the jerk fried rice and the carnitas.. it was gone in 5 minutes (shoved all into his mouth). 

I am a big fan of triple D and when I saw this place I put it on the places I want to go before I die... yep... lived up to the hype...."}
{"text":"I am glad I tried this place.  I had heard rumors and stopped in here with a coworker who LOVEs it here.  I enjoyed the samples they provide and ordering is a little tricky for the first timer  but they are ready and willing to help you out there at the counter.  The food combinations are unique and flavorful.  I would recommend trying the place but as most of the DDD places I have gone to, meeeh.  Don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"This place looks awful
Food is greasy and makes me feel heavy.

So why the decent rating? the food you do get tastes awesome.
Price did go up this year, and the portion is variable.

Star taken off since some days I order and my bowl is full and sometimes it's 3/5ths full.  I often get pick-up so all the food gets mushed up together and it's very clear when portions are not the same.

I love the food and will be returning."}
{"text":"This place for about 10 years has been on my to do list while in Phoenix since I have been attending spring training games.

So fast forward to now and what a disappointment, the staff is cool and the food comes out fast, fast to make you think that they have trays of food ready to go and not fresh.

Tried their Jen Red Pork and Jade Ren Chicken with white rice, they give you a complimentary cookie with your bowl as well.

Wishing the food would be great to come back but nah! Tasted to me like heat lamp Chinese fast food."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of the first places that comes to mind when I want something quick and easy, yet unique. I like to introduce anybody that visits me out here to this place.  A great blend of flavors and plenty of choices.  

I always get the two item combo.  ALWAYS Jerk chicken fried rice (one of the more flavorful rices).  ALWAYS black beans (not your typical black beans!  the refried beans are just.... refried beans).  Jade chicken is a favorite for all you people who like your deep fried battered pieces of chicken in some citrusy-sweet sauce.... the kind of Chinese item that white people love to eat from Panda :-)   It's one of my favorites too... probably because I grew up eating fried chicken.  Emerald chicken is more what I think my parents would like.... onion-y and ginger-y flavors on non-fried chicken.  Whatever your tastes, it's all good.  

They're great about letting you sample the different items.  And the snickerdoodle they give with your meal is a perfect end to your meal!"}
{"text":"I don't think the food or restaurant cleanliness is very good.  I don't know why people like this restaurant."}
{"text":"A Hispanic panda? Duh, you should eat here.

#greatfood
#redjadechicken

Get the snickerdoodle too...it will change your life."}
{"text":"Chini bandido.....good food in a hidden place in one of the strip malls
...jade chicken was good and the bkack beans were very good...almost cuban style. The carnitas burrito....well it is sorry behind excuse for a burrito and it wasn't that good. Comes in aluminum bowl and plastic utensils.....i guess to save on washing dishes. The place has sort of escuela cafeteria experience to it. However, the staff is friendly and they even give you samples.  I expect more out of this place....they should do dim sum Mexican or something...now that would be interesting."}
{"text":"I don't know how you could go wrong. I get great service and yummy food. I suggest watching out for the long lines on Sunday afternoons cuz they can get very busy!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for white table cloths and fine china - this is not the place for you. If you want great Mexican/Chinese food at very good prices served in To-go containers on Costco tables and chairs - you'll love this place. 

Very unique place well worth the trip. The food couldn't be better and that is what really matters - to me anyway. Each year when we come to Phoenix for spring training we visit this awesome place. I encourage you to do as l"}
{"text":"I was first turned onto Chino's when I worked at Honeywell 5 years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Their amazing infusion of Chinese and Mexican amongst other types of food is what keeps me coming back. The number of possible combinations is limitless.

Some people may comment on the cleanliness of the place.  All I have to say is in the 5 years I've been a customer I haven't had one complaint.

Take it from me, this place is perfect for the out of towner or first timer."}
{"text":"Great costumer service. Decent food. I grabbed jade red chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice combo. It was yummy. I'd say the Phoenix Chino Bandido tastes better but it's always a crowd there. The jerk chicken had the perfect spice to it. Not overwhelmingly hot. I'd tell friends to give it a try if in mood for Mexican/ Asian fusion."}
{"text":"I know this may be unpopular opinion, but I just never really liked Chino. The combo of the ingredients never sat well with me. I can never stomach it! I don't think I should have to mentally prepare myself to eat somewhere! Perhaps separately, the Chinese and Mexican food would do good, but for the price, I'm still not a fan."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The food is great. The menu however can be hard to figure out but I like that they have 2 counters with people to help you order correctly. I had the jade chicken, chicken fried rice and the Diablo chicken. Rice is on point and the jade chicken is really good but holy hell was the Diablo chicken fire. Not as hot as the last time we had it. (My wife and I had it and it took 20 min to stop coughing and the burning sensation) lol. But it's so good I couldn't stop eating it. The people are friendly and the service is great. This is a must stop as they some crazy Chinese and Mexican combos. Good eats for sure!"}
{"text":"First impression: Are we in a cafeteria?  There were lines of table and chairs that reminded me of elementary school.  My coworker told me to go up and try the samples for new comers.  The girl behind the counter was very nice and offered me a large number of small samples.  I decided on a combo so I could try a bunch of things.  I had the spicy black beans, pork fried rice, sweet pork and emerald chicken.  I sat down with my coworkers and we were presented with foil to go containers filled with food.  All my coworkers preferred the red jade chicken (sweet n sour).  I thought their Americanized Chinese food was pretty good and very interesting when combined with Mexican food."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is so bizarre, in an awesome and delectable way. The fusion of so many different flavors and cultures totally works. One of my favorite spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken quesadilla WITH emerald sauce!!!! Amazing! !! My new favorite.  The black beans are to for, and then the jerk fried rice. Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Love Chino Bandito! The food is awesome and the service is spectacular!!!! Don't let the hole in the wall location scare you. They are the best!"}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is one of our local favorites where I typically take out-of-state visitors. I like to showcase the Asian/Mexican/Caribbean fusion because it is so unique. You can order Asian food in a quesadilla or burrito AND they give you a delicious snickerdoodle cookie for free = munchies paradise. 

After being at both locations (Phoenix and Chandler), I can say without a doubt the Chandler site is much nicer and better kept. It's a little hard to find at first but I always remember it as being buried behind Walgreens. Pro-tips: if you've never been there, tell them! They'll hook you up with multiple free samples off their menu. You may also want to ask them for help ordering - it'll take you a few times going there before you get it, trust me. Free refills off the soda fountain (Pepsi).

I always order their flagship dish, Jade Red Chicken. It's like General Tsao's Chicken meets Orange Chicken - really, really good! Whether I order it stand alone, in a combo plate, or in a quesadilla or burrito just depends on what mood I am in. I LOVE their jerk fried rice, it's just the right amount of spicy and has amazing flavor. My girlfriend is a big fan as well. Their Emerald Chicken tastes light and refreshing. Their teriyaki chicken is OK. You can order refried or black beans - not that either is bad but I just ask for twice as much jerk fried rice instead (which they will do).

I highly recommend this place at least to say you've tried it. You get a lot of food for your money. Caution: as you continue to go here the wait for your food will start to seem like forever because you want to eat it so bad. The reason I believe Chino is four, not five stars is because it could be a little easier to order there and the atmosphere inside is kind of basic. There's so much space in there I wish they'd have a bar or better beer selection. Otherwise, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I love Chino's.  I've been coming here for at least 20 years.  They're still good, not necessarily the Chino's of old times but, I'm still always excited to get it and satisfied after."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of my husband and mine all time favorites. It's casual but really fun unique food that packs a great fusion flavor.  They allow newbies to try samples, so it would well for bringing people to try it. .. the combo deals are the way to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. The jerk chicken burrito and snicker doodle cookies are amazing. The service is awesome as well"}
{"text":"Americanized carnitas. Americanized orange chicken. Refried beans and steamed rice. Put that all into a box as a combo and they call it \"fusion.\" If Trump advertised a panda sporting a thick Mexican 'stache wearing a sombrero, he'd receive hell on earth for being racist. I think it's good humor. But please be more imaginative with the food and quality."}
{"text":"Lien must have seen the confusion on our faces when we walked in. He commenced to offering us delicious samples of the menu items. I deceided on the jade red chicken, the machaca and the jerk fried rice. All were pretty tasty.The meats were seasond well and i loved the jade sauce. They also threw in some snickerdoodle cookies that were also tasty! The service was fast and friendly and i'm glad we ate there."}
{"text":"I frequented this place often when I was visiting my parents in Mesa. I had heard of it on Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives) and had to try it. It was simply marvelous darling! The ordering process was a bit of a beezy to get through, but once you get it you're golden. Also the employees were friendly, patient, and helpful. The wait for the food was kind of lengthy, especially if you're starving, which I was. Nevertheless, it was well worth the wait. I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, who'd a thunk it, Chinese and Mexican fusion? 
The portion size is massive. The Jade Red Chicken is a cross between Panda Express' Orange Chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The Emerald Chicken tastes fresh with its layers of ginger and green onion (without leaving you with overwhelming onion burps for the rest of the day). The chicken is moist and has never been dry and overcooked. The Cuban Black Beans have a smooth consistency and taste even better knowing it's made with olive oil rather than lard. I always choose the plain white rice so as not to overload my taste buds. To end the meal on a sweet note, every meal comes with a warm, freshly-baked (at least that's what it tastes like) Snickerdoodle cookie. I would actually consider coming here just to get the cookie.
Parking was ample. Crowds were large at times and it can get pretty loud. The decor was kind of a miss, but I'm clearly not there to admire their walls."}
{"text":"i literally eat the roof off of this joint.

My girlfriend introduced me to Chino about 2 years ago. Since then i have probably eaten here about 20 times. My go to plate is jade red chicken, pork fried rice, black refried beans, and a machaca quesadilla (when i am feeling crazy i also order a pollo diablo burro).

Somedays the food portions are larger than others and some days the food is better than others. I ate here last night and i was the best it has ever been resulting in a classic 5 star yelp review (shocked i haven't reviewed it already considering i'm addicted to chino).

I have eaten at both locations but prefer the 19th ave location. The thing you gotta love about this place is how crazy it gets in there. You've got a crazy menu to order from, and a hilarious open area of plastic tables and chairs filled with people not really sure of whats going on. Theres kids running around climbing all over a giant panda while everyone is dying to hear their name called out so they can feast on a crazy mexican chinese infused plate of heaven.

If you have never been don't be shy and get a few free samples from the sample area to the left of the register. I still have not tried everything on the menu but will venture off my standard go to plate one day.

5 stars for sure and i love this place after a hard Sunday of tailgating/drinking at the Cardinals game."}
{"text":"Their fried rice sucks and is flavorless.
Their beans suck and are flavorless.
Their meats are hit and miss... the Jade Chicken is very good, but some of their meats are a bit flavorless.
I guess if you got the meats in a quesadilla, or burrito or whatever, it might be better.  Some people love this place, some people HATE IT.  Your mileage may vary.  It's worth trying, even if just for the uniqueness of the place."}
{"text":"Oh my dear!  Like Mexico, Jamacia and China did the tango on my tongue.  Being a first timer,  I was guided through the menu by a Chino Bandido expert.  I was intrigued by the unorthodox flavor combinations.  Honestly,  I'm not sure how fried rice, emerald chicken (ginger, green onion,  salt) and cuban beans could work together on a plate, but they do!  And those cookies....so yummy.  I'll be back soon to try something completely different."}
{"text":"The Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla is life-changingly delicious. It is so good, you'll consider suicide right then and there, because you know nothing will ever be this delicious again. The first time biting into a Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla belongs on a list of rare life experiences like your wedding day or the birth of your first child. These things only happen once. After that, your entire gastronomic life is downhill, I'm telling you.

Look, this is my favorite restaurant in the world. This hole-in-the-wall slinging greasy food in disposable takeout tins rules the roost when it comes to EFFING DELICIOUSNESS. This is a destination restaurant disguised as a dump. This is a place that with the proper business minds could be the next mindblowing, world conquering fast food chain. Sadly, the husband/wife team running this joint aren't really interested in world domination, so there is just this one lowly location in West Phoenix (there was a location in Chandler, but it was the single worst located restaurant I had ever seen. You could use Google Maps on your phone and still drive by it six times and not know it was there... not really a shock that it's closed. Too bad, the East Valley is deprived of the culinary genius of this place).

So, you go here and you have no idea what's going on. You know what? Just go to the counter and tell them you've never been there before. They'll give you a tasting tour of the menu.

But if you trust the people in the know (in other words, me), the get a Two item combo with:
Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla
Jerk Chicken
Pork Fried Rice
Cuban Black Beans

Alternatively, you could swap out the Jerk Chicken for Pollo Diablo and the Pork Fried Rice for Jerk Fried Rice, but that's a SUPER heavy meal, so only indulge if you have a cast-iron stomach."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and the second was a lot better than the first.  If its your first visit don't try to decipher the confusing looking order slip and just go straight to the counter.  Portions are pretty good but the chile relleno has waaaay too much breading.  Dont bother with the burritos and the cheese quesadillas since they are tiny and totally not worth the price.  The emerald, jerk chicken and fried are excellent though.  I would still have to explore all of their menu to find what i like best."}
{"text":"I loved there food the chinese food was authentic.. This was down the street from the hotel I was staying at for business. It absolutely the best fusion chinese and mexican food I had ever tasted.. 

I had ordered the Jamican jerk rice with ginger chicken and chop suey quesedilla.. I wish they had one where I live.. 

I can see why Diners and Drive In's give this place such a good rating it is awesome :)"}
{"text":"If Chino's had a location in Los Angeles, it would make a killing.  Styrofoam casual, inexpensive, and packed with flavor.  I don't know if fusion food can be said to be \"authentic,\" but the menu here is so personal and potent, it tastes like an undiscovered national cuisine.  I no longer live in Phoenix but make a special effort to eat here anytime I visit."}
{"text":"Yeah, I don't get it. Is it all hype or do people really enjoy this place?? I had Chino Bandido for the first time the other day. We ordered ahead and a co worker brought it in. The menu and ordering process is confusing, and I wasn't in the mood to take a class just to order off a menu, so I stuck with something simple. Jade Red Chicken and fried rice. Not impressed. The rice tasted like green onion and pepper (lots of pepper) and the Jade Chicken...I guess it tasted like their Jade Chicken?? Did I say I wasn't impressed??? Maybe I'll give another try.......or not."}
{"text":"I had the spicy red jade and half egg fo young with Jerk fried rice and my partner had carnitas.  It was great / different and tasty.  We'd come back.  Good service even with the fill out your order card kinda front desk."}
{"text":"Upon walking to into this establishment I wasn't expecting much. Very minimal decor, cafeteria style rows of tables and no \"ambiance\" if you will. They asked if I'd ever been there before and when I replied no they ushered me away from the cash register...a little skeptical until I was shown an assortment of menu items to try for FREE! nice touch! So after sampling everything I was shown how to fill out their order form, that was the reason I can't give five stars! It was very intricate and detailed and required too much thought for a starving person!! I ordered a bean cheese and carnitas burrito. Boring I know but after sampling all the amazing things they offered I wanted something I hadnt tried! The meat was tender and juicy not dry at all, the beans and cheese were perfect. Best part of the burrito was that the cheese wasnt that cheap oily cheese they use in most mexican joints! I was also offered my choice of chocolate or snickerdoodle cookie with my meal at NO CHARGE! score! I was dining with about nine other people and that was the first time all day we were all quiet!! I'd definitely return here on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Still Dirty.
Still Overhyped for what it is.
Still Overpriced for what you get.
Still sick of hearing about it.
Cookie still good ~ big whoop...still."}
{"text":"Great food. Environment is very dive like but the fod was great. Jade chicken quesadilla was the best."}
{"text":"I've been there twice.  Both times I was totally underwhelmed.  Other people I know, love this place, but it isn't for me.  The food is not terrible, but it is neither great Chinese food (like your typical, average quality mom and pop Chinese food), nor great Mexican food (not even as good as Filiberto's). Oddly, and confusing to me, this place is often busy, but I chalk that up to the novelty of restaurant, more than the quality of the food.  The ordering process is confusing and convoluted, adding to the wait times.  Also, the dining area has zero atmosphere and is like a typical generic cafeteria.  If you do go there, get your food to go."}
{"text":"Jade red chicken and Emerald chicken combo bowl with any rice or beans you'd prefer. Thank me later"}
{"text":"Chino has been my go to restaurant for years, and it continues to exceed all of my expectations. I'm always greeted by smiling, energetic employees who seem to love working there. Not only does the food come out within 5 minutes almost every time, but you can tell that it was just made and has a lot of work put into it. Not only is the service and food great, the prices are as well. for less than ten dollars you get to leave the store wondering how you just ate the entire bowl of food in such a short time, which is an amazing feeling. I will continue to support Chinos. 
p.s.. try the jade red chicken with black beans. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican! Trifecta.  Definitely get points for originality..... plus it was on the food network on \"Man vs Food\".  I like the Red Jade chicken with pork fried rice mixed with refried beans! It was delicious!  I have to bump this up a star since I'm pretty much addicted to this place.  The jade red chicken, pork fried rice and refried beans is a great trifecta, and I usually mix it up for the 2nd entree- either pork carnitas, jerk chicken, or any of the other many great items they have here."}
{"text":"ah Chino. I have been going here for years, well actually the other location, but same place. This location is really hard to find if you don't know where it is.... it seems like the location is not really great for their business... but I dunno. This place is good in that bad kind of way. The food is greasy, it comes out on paper plates or in tin take out dishes. It pretty much always makes me feel sick after eating there.... but I still eat there because it's just good sometimes. I always get an emerald chicken burrito and machaca quesadilla in a combo with the jerk fried rice. The emerald chicken is good.... all white meat and really oniony. It's one of the more asian-y dishes. The machaca is good too, just standard shredded beef with tomato, garlic, and onion.The BF gets bean and cheese burritos and seems to like them. I think the thing that always brings me back is the free snickerdoodles. They're sooo good....and also they are free which makes them even better. So against my better judgment, I will keep going to Chino Bandito.... 


Oh, and if you're drunk... this place gets at least one more star."}
{"text":"Ohhh Chino. I have been coming to Chino since I was in high school (not regularly, but you know... when the urge hits....). This place is..... different? They serve a Mexican/Chinese fusion in a very fast food way. I usually get an emerald chicken burrito (which is greasy, but at least uses white meat chicken), a quesadilla with machaca (although the last time I got the jade chicken....mistake..... too much breading, not really spicy.... I picked that out), and the Jerk Fried Rice (always fairly tasty). The food is not high quality.... it isn't even all that delicious..... and yet, I still feel the need to come here every once in awhile. Maybe it's the free cookie... or maybe it's just the fact that I can get a good variety of food. Regardless, don't expect much from this restaurant, but, if you're in the neighborhood, try it!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by my a friend, and the minute I heard Chinese Mexican fusion I was hooked. I've seen many Korean Mexican fusion restaurants but not Chinese so I had to try this place out even though it was a 40 min drive. 

The lady who takes your order was so helpful. When she found out it was my friend and my first time there, she immediately gestured us to the counter so that she could explain the menu and provide samples. The samples made it a bit harder to choose because everything was delicious. Once your orders ready, they call your name and bring your it to your table as well. Service here is great. 

You have the option of getting a regular or -my choice- the combo which gives you 2 meat options rice and beans. 
BEANS- The black beans were AMAZING. They're some type of Cuban beans and semi-sweet. Highly recommend it! You can ask for a sample too.
MEAT- You have the option to get your meat in a quesadilla or burrito and I didn't do either. I regret it so much because I realized too late that's part of the 'fusion'. I ordered #7 Jade Red Chicken (pretty much like orange chicken and I believe the most popular) and #13 Pollo Diablo. The chicken weren't as juicy as the samples but delicious regardless. 
RICE- Jerk Fried Rice was good. I wish they gave more of this than the beans. 
They also give you a SUGAR COOKIE with your meal!!! 

If you're in this area, definitely check this place out. I would come back to get my order in a quesadilla or burrito if there's an opportunity."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband last night
Staff was nice
Food was good for fast food.
I hade the jade chicken with jerk fried rice.
I don't think I'll return it wasn't anything spectacular"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and was a lil hesitant and nervous to try, but took a risk. I ordered the jade red chicken black beans and jerk fried rice with a carnitas quesadilla. The jade chicken is super good! It has the right crisp to every bite and the flavor is like a orange chicken with a twist. The black beans are good. they are definitely different and have a sweet taste. The jerk fried rice to me wasn't that flavorful. Still good tho. The cookie I'm sure is good. overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Cool concept, bad food.  Low quality ingredients.  The poorest quality jasmine rice money can buy.  I tried the emerald chicken and the jade red chicken.  It was worse than expected considering all the good reviews.  Sorry, not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"The place is a staple of Phoenix and must be experienced by everyone at least once. 

The place is a dive in a dirty (not unsafe just dirty) part of of town. The food is great and an interesting mix. Most of the people that go there head there often so feel free to ask the people in line what's good. And there is almost always a line ;)

And in case my review is the only one you have read, you can see the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode from Food Network featuring this place if you do an internet search for it."}
{"text":"Hmmm....i come from LA so I eat alot of asian food and I eat alot of mexican food. To merge the two.....hmmm......all I can say is that its definitely different and one visit is not enough to really determine if this place gets a higher rating. 

I will say that the staff and service was great. They have it set up so you can taste test some of the fusion food together so you can make better choices when ordering. The employee who helped us we really nice and helpful. She helped us taste test some of the items and helped us order.

I think the food is good. I am just not use to mixing the different type of food together in one dish so I definitely need to break down that personal barrier. I will have to visit again and try different combination. The jury is still out..."}
{"text":"Delicious, every time.
I always order #10 & #14 with with rice. Mmmmm
I recommend it to my friends and family. There no place like it, only in Arizona."}
{"text":"Came before closing. No cookies ! Boo but I totally understand. I had to come here from old memories.. Tad disappointed in the 3 T oil in my plate. 

Meats are interesting. Full full of oil tho  they use to much in the stir fry. 

Emerald chick good quality white meat and very much for a ginger lover !! 

Black beans and rice tasty. Had to warm up at home as it was all pretty cool and I. Was only 5 mins away. 

I would say def give a try if you've not been but my days are over with it :)"}
{"text":"Always a great choice for a different dining venue for those that don't know if they want Mexican, Chinese  and/or food with a  \"Jamaican\" twist. Why not have all three. Have dined here many times. Today had the combo Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice. Great family owned business with its  own unique flavor.

Red Jen Pork was nicely done with a great texture and mild heat. Jerk Chicken was nicely seasoned, you can taste the distinct All Spice. Jerk Fried Rice was good, but can pick and choose your sides. Enough left over for a second meal and of course the Snicker Doodle Cookie.

You either love it or you don't. Nothing real fancy but solid goodness if you are into those cuisines."}
{"text":"OK,  So Hubs and I stopped in based off Yelp reviews and while we really liked it, I guess I was expecting more based off the reviews.

It is a hole inthe wall which is a good thing in my book.  The best restaurants usually are.  So ordering can be confusing but the gal at the counter was very helpful and offered up samples - big plus - to help us decide.  

I settled on the Emerald Chicken with black beans and Hubby got a combo of the carnitas and emerald chicken burrito.  I really liked (not loved) the Emerald chicken, lots of garlic and spices - yum.  Plus all white meat chicken.  The carnitas aere not so good in my book.  A little tough and dry.  The tortillas for the burrito were awesome though!  Tasted like homade with no lard spared!

I do have to agree that the black beans were a highlight.  Very flavorful and I couldn't identify what it was.  Now they aren't whole black beans like you get in many other restaurants but some sort of re-fry so I'm sure they are fat loaded, but that is probably why they are so good.  The rice, both white and jerk fried were just meh.  Nothing special and quite greasy - even the white rice.  Also the cookies were nothing great.  Took one bite and tossed it.

So overall we had a nice lunch but nothing I'd go out of my way for and definately off the list if you are watching your diet!"}
{"text":"It's so disappointing every single time I try and eat here, because I legitimately like the food. However, a restaurant like this shouldn't require reservations, but in order to get your food in a timely manner that's almost what it needs.

I'm not too sure what the issue is because I've seen busier restaurants and I've never had to wait so long! I've complained before regarding the long wait and they told me if I want to be able to get my food in a timely manner, then I should call my food in ahead of time. Well I've tried THREE TIMES! 

On one occasion they put me on hold for ten minutes, which I wasn't upset about. Then someone picked up the phone and said \"oh someone's on a call\" and they were scrounging around to find out who's on call with me until the finally said hello AND ended up hanging up on me. Second time I tried calling, they said they couldn't hear me and hung up on me and when I tried calling back, it was busy for 30 minutes. Third time (which is the last time I tried calling) no one ever picked up. Either I was getting hung up on MULTIPLE times or they were ignoring my calls, which I tried calling from didn't numbers thinking it might have been my service.

At some point the poor service starts to outweigh the food. I will honestly never come here again."}
{"text":"Oh snap!   Imagine carrying two of your favorite foods styles Chinese and Mexican in this case) and dropping them on your freshly cleaned countertop...yeah bummer right?   No you mix that stuff up and chow down!   If Chino was pretentious they would call their menu \"Asian/Mexican fusion\".  But if they did that they would have to charge more.  This place is a prefect blend of great food and tastes that you wouldn't think would work but do.  I have yet to find my \"favorite\" because all of their meals are great.   They also permit small samples of each item so make sure to tell them if it is your first time or wish to try something new.  

Oh yeah they were on Diners,drive-ins, and dives a few years back so there is that."}
{"text":"Fast and good for lunch.  Not too great in terms of ambiance.  The price I think is high for the quality. But they seem to have lots of regulars."}
{"text":"Chinese Mexican Fusion? Sounds strange but oddly alluring. It kinda works. I walked away very satisfied and plan on going back. The line was long, and the dining area was kind of dingey, but the food was really good, so I will probably just do takeout next time. I get the hype."}
{"text":"Interesting place...it's a local fave for a lot of people. As a vegetarian, there aren't a lot of options for me, but I can usually find something. Big thumbs-up for the free cookie. Ditto for the free samples. Thumbs down for the ordering process -- it's a bit of a pain, to say the least. The quirky decor -- pandas in sombreros -- is hilarious. The place is a dive in terms of atmosphere/decor, but the food's pretty good. That's usually the way it works, I guess."}
{"text":"Food is always great as it speaks for itself I just love this place. I like
 How you can try everything before you buy it and its rare that restraunts let you do that.  I usually get that ginger chicken thing(emerald) and jen red chicken jerk fried rice and blk beans . absolutely delicious i use to hate beans there for not eat em but chino has truly got me into them ty again chino i think you guys are great if you. Dont believe me ask Guy from dinners drive ins and dives n he'll tell ya!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Every time i'm in Phoenix I have to go there. It's cool because they'll let you try stuff before you order so you can make sure you like what you're getting. The place is definitely not the nicest but it doesn't have to be because the food is so good."}
{"text":"This place is legendary.  If you're feeling brave, definitely check it out.  If you aren't, find someone who is, and have them take you.  The mix of Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican go together better than you could hope!

My standard course of action was to get the jerk friend rice, black beans, a Sweet and Sour chicken quesadilla, and then some random item for fun.

So if you head out, make sure you try a Sweet and Sour chicken quesadilla, and say hi to the owners, if you get a chance.  They are super nice folks, and have some fun stories to tell ;)"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is possibly my favorite place to eat of all time. Certainly it is in the top 3. Completely unique, spectacularly flavorful food in a family atmosphere with a great staff. My son and I were once regulars here and made some great friends amongst the other regs. Chino Bandido is a great treasure and, since we've moved away from Phoenix back to our home in the Bay Area, it is very sorely missed but we will be back from time to time and it will doubtless be the culinary highlight of the trip."}
{"text":"I used to live right around the corner from the N PHX location.  DANGEROUS!
I love the menus!  Pick and choose what you want.  I always get the jade chicken with the spicy chicken and black beans.  Always a container of black beans to go, too!
And snickerdoodles!  Who can resist????????????"}
{"text":"I love their food. I am doing a whole food diet with no grains. I was easily able to find some meet and veggie options that tasted AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard whispers of this place for quite a while but am not one to rush out and let that bubble pop so easily. What a great place, no really. The people are genuinely nice the food smells, looks and is delicious, what they don't have in tangible ambiance they make up for in a feel good vibe. There's a couple of other gems in that same shopping center I must visit. Kudos for not disappointing me, to be honest I was trying not to set my hopes too high and you really made my day. Support this place! Visit often and tell a friend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Mexican meets Chinese cuisine. Been here a few times, and I love it every time. This time around, I got the Carnitas and an Emerald Chicken Quesadilla. If you like ginger, get the Emerald Chicken! Their carnitas are your standard seasoned shredded beef, and their jade pork and jerk chicken are also great items to get! And you can put any of these meats in the quesadilla or burrito, which gives you a bunch of fun combinations. 
Also, get their black beans. I'm not completely sure what they put in it, but it's deliciousness in every bite. At this point, I felt like my stomach was going to explode from all the great food, but don't forget about their complementary snickerdoodle cookie! They're so great, you're going to want to buy them by the dozen! (Which, they also have!)"}
{"text":"They are really gluten free friendly!  

They aren't so vegetarian friendly.  You could get veggies and beans, I suppose, but that's not too exciting.  They made my boyfriend a burrito with just veggies wrapped up in a tortilla-they left the beans out!.  That's not really a burrito, if you ask me.  There seemed to be some confusion on what to put in it, but I don't understand why.  Beans+veggies+tortilla.  Why is that so hard?  Oh well.  He survived and I'm sure he'd go again, but make sure to have it done right this time."}
{"text":"There is no place like Chino Bandido.  I'd say Mexican/Chinese fusion but the word \"fusion\" makes it sound fancy and pretentious, which Chino Bandido is NOT.

I get a 2 item combo, my two items being jerk chicken and jade red chicken.  Get this.... you can get them in a quesadilla!!  Game changer.

For sides, my go tos are black beans and jerk fried rice.  

Sure it's an odd combo, but it's freaken delicious.  And they cap it all off with a complimentary snickerdoodle.

HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Love love love chino Bandidos! They let you try out the food before you order ( and you should because some of it is really spicey! ) I personally love the jade chicken. I was really disappointed when the one in the east valley closed but at least they still have one in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for 25 years, one of a kind food.  Absolutely a must-go. I love quesadillas, so I order both entries as quesadillas. My favorites, Jerk Chicken, Jade Red Chicken"}
{"text":"I went here on the advice of a friend who saw it on the over rated Guy Fieri show on Food TV. I think that this place is over rated, really over rated. It is a dingy place with dingy food. I had a chile rellano with stir fried rice. It was not worth $8. 

The food was hot. I will give it that. 

The cookie that they call a Snickerdoodle does not even come close to a true Snickerdoodle. My cookie was tasteless and I tossed it in the trash with my aluminum tin and all the Styrofoam drink containers that they use for soft drinks. They should try recycling or start using reusable plastic plates and glasses but then they would have to pay a dishwasher. Maybe they should think about a little  about the environment."}
{"text":"This is by FAR my fav place to get lunch when I was working in Chandler. I usually order a combo with 2 meats, jerk fried rice, black beans, and it comes with a delicious warm snickerdoodle cookie!! The portions are quite large. The staff is so friendly and if you call in for take out they prepare the food super quick! One time I forgot to call ahead and just stopped in on my lunch break, they were quite busy and said it would be a long wait to get my food but I told them I was on my lunch break at work and they rushed it for me!! :) absolutely love this place!! The food is great, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick affordable lunch!"}
{"text":"Feel good tasty comfort food served here.

Don't understand the menu?  Just ask for the first timers tasting tour.  From that point, it becomes pretty clear and order away...

Me?  A man who loves Chinese and Mexican food, and thinks the hybrid of two is a natural match when you consider that mix has been created many times from leftovers in my fridge?  Sold.

I had a 2 meat combo of Emerald Chicken (white chicken breast with a green ginger mix) and Carnitas.  Delicious and a fine mix between the two.

My sides were the Cuban black beans (smashed beans, not whole) and white rice.  God, I love that mix.  All I'm missing are plantains.

Throw in a soda and my entire meal was under $10.  

Straight up, a very good place to eat with king flavor. 

The only thing I'll say is, they need some music in that place.  It makes it a little dreary, being all quiet.  Then again, it is quiet because the people are busy stuffing their faces."}
{"text":"It was okay. I liked the emerald chicken with the ginger sauce very fresh. The red jade pork has given me heart burn and too much spice in the jerk rice to enjoy. Willing to go back and try something else if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What happens when Mexican and Chinese food fall into a kitchen together? You get Chino Bandido!! I love this place! For first timers, the menu might seem weird on how to order since you fill out a paper and add what you want or create your own bowl, plate or burrito-esque dish, but the staff will help you and if you are not sure what to get, they offer samples to taste!!
My favorite is the jerk red chicken(kind of like orange chicken with an attitude), side of rice, and black beans, cooked to perfection! Every order comes with their famous snickerdoodle cookie that is to die for and available to purchase 6 or 12 pk. DIne in or takee outee(as their sign says). Love it!!"}
{"text":"I really like chino bandido. I come 2-3 times a month. The Jade red chicken is a must. The beans are more like a sludge, not a huge fan. The chile rellano is awesome! Quesadilla is not a big deal. Neither are the burritos. (They're tiny!) I always order teriyaki chicken. Whether it's in a bowl, quesadilla, etc. I always ask for the teriyaki sauce in the side. They forget the sauce 9 out of 10 times. It's very annoying to eat dry chicken when ur expecting a sauce with it. The macho a is so bad omg I took one bite and it was so disgusting. I gave it to my dog lol Good food for the most part but the place needs some major remodeling. I feel like their ego has got to them. It's good food but they are nothing to be worshipped. Snickerdoodles are bomb tho!"}
{"text":"My sister, two nephews, and I went here on a recommendation of a high schoo friend.  I wasn't disappointed.  My friend was there to show us how to order.  It's a little complicated the first time, but not an insurmountable task.

- The teriyaki chicken was nummers.
- Jerk Fried Rice and the Jerk quesadilla - Mucho good-o.  They used authentic jerk seasoning too, which was nice.
- Black beans - Excelente.  Not as good as mine, but very good!
- The insufferable, bratty kid who was climbing all over the place, turning lights on and off, ignored by is inconsiderate and rude mother - Sucked.  I wanted to get up, lead him by the ear to mommy, deposit him in a chair, and give her the frowning of a lifetime ;-)

Very good.  This place should open up a franchise in Austin.  It would be a great fit!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot... It's not fancy, but it's delicious.  If you like a \"hole in the wall\" style restaurant that has unique flavors... this place is for you.  A bit of Mexico, a bit of China...  a LOT of flavor.  Also, their cookies are out of this world.
Tip: ask for a sample of anything you want to try.  They will happily accommodate you!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while visiting Phoenix.  The food was okay in my opinion.  The concept is cool however the food wasn't as tasty as I had hoped.  Fun to try once at least."}
{"text":"Not sure if you want Chinese or Mexican food? This place solves that problem. Love the Emerald Chicken and the jerk fried rice. The place is set up cafeteria-style - long tables and sit where you want. You can also get a sampling of many of their items and they explain what they are and how their ordering system works. It's not complicated, but it's helpful to know."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 17 years.  One of my first dates in high school was here.  I don't know what has happened lately.  I was here yesterday and had the jen red pork.  It was completely dry and in editable.  When my husband asked to have it replaced, we were told \"that's the way the dish is\".  OMG no it's not.  The batch had been burnt.  The guy behind the counter casually gave us our money back, like it was no big deal.  There was no apology or offer to correct the situation.  Sadly, I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Good food, great service!
Worth every dime! We did a 'Siri' search and found this restaurant in the area we were driving from. A small local joint, look n feel just like a take-out joint. We thought to pass it and go for a restaurant setting but kiddies were hungry and reviews were inviting so stepped in.  Glad we did! Great service, good food, wonderful fusion created. Spice levels were suiting our palate. We would return to this joint, if we get a chance."}
{"text":"I love Asian fusion foods! I finally got to try Chino Bandido after hearing about it years ago and seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

I didn't have high expectations for this place, and it was a good thing I didn't. The concept is great, because I've had bomb Asian-Mexican fusion cuisines.  But Chino Bandido may have been lacked in authentic flavor for me. I got the Jen Red Pork + Chile Relleno Combo with Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  It wasn't bad, but I felt that it could have been better.  The meat was a little too greasy for me. 

2.5 stars because I've had much better, but wouldn't oppose to coming back here.  Customer service was decent so I'd like to round up for that.  Also got free Snickerdoodle cookies with our orders.  How can you not like that?"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Chino Bandido.  I did some research and ordered the Jade Red chicken, Emerald chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans.  The Jade Red was great - crispy, spicy, and a little sweet.  I wouldn't get the emerald chicken again - the only thing giving it flavor were the green onions.  The jerk fried rice was great!  And so were the black beans.  The combo of chinese entrees with latino sides didn't feel weird to me at all.  I'll be coming here again :)"}
{"text":"This place is freaking brilliant!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!   It's a must stop whenever I'm in the Phoenix area.  The homemade tortillas are a must - get a combo and get at least one thing as a burrito.  My go to is the egg foo young burrito, pollo diablo burrito, jerk fried rice and black beans. Sometimes I'll switch it up with the jade red chicken too.

The snickerdoodles are fantastic as well.  Staff are super friendly and everyone in there will help you with ordering if you don't know what you're doing."}
{"text":"I've been going to the other Chino Bandito for years.  And I love it, love it so.... (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A).  Sure, it's a hole in the wall kind of place, but it worked.  My friend told me about their new fancy Chandler location (it's a 2nd location, not a replacement) and I figure I have to give it a shot.  

OH MY GOODNESS!

This place is a completely different experience than the Phoenix location.  Original Phx location - bad old linoleum floors.  New Chandler location - stained concrete.  Original - Limited seating, with tables and chairs seemingly borrowed from a church social.  New - Tons and tons of seating, in tables that look like they belong in a restaurant.  Original - Small spot in an old \"seen better days\" strip mall.  New - Really huge space in, well, a fancy new version of a strip mall behind a Walgreens

Thank goodness some things never change.  The food is just as great at this new location.  Mexican, Carribian and Asian all mixed together on one menu.  Jade Pork in a Quesadilla with Chicken Fried  rice and spicy black refried beans.  

If you're at all confused about how it works I suggest you either go to their web site to their \"menu demo\"  or better yet just go there one day for lunch or dinner.  Everyone will find something they like.

As Andrew mentioned, filling out the menu ticket isn't quite as important at this location, but I still absolutely suggest it.  Take a few, you and your friends all fill them out at the same time, debating the merits of each potential combination and then ya get in line to order.  It's half the fun.  And of course the other half is the eating.  Yum!"}
{"text":"You can't go just once to Chino.  It just doesn't work that way.  Your first time there they'll walk you though the whole process and let you sample all the different flavors they have of meat and even rice and beans.  You're thinking - wow this is great - free appetizers.  Oh no.  What really just happened is \"they got you\". Oh yes.  Because no matter how good your food was, you'll be wondering... Hmmm... I wonder how that would have been as a burrito?  Or, wow, that other one might have been fun as a quesadilla.  Or, wow, I didn't realize I'd burn my mouth on that, maybe next time I won't try to look like a big dog in front of the honeys.  Something like that.

Kids love going to Chino.  The giant panda bandito statue is meant to be climbed on and loved.  They have a kids menu too - which is so important. 

Sue, the location kinda looks like a hole in the wall, but who doesn't love hole in the wall places???"}
{"text":"Walked over from the Embassy Suites North and was pleasantly surprised. It's not fancy. It's not expensive. It's simple and one-of-a-kind. The dude at the front let me sample. The jerk chicken has very good flavor, as does the jade chicken. I like the selection of rices. The snickerdoodle is not necessary, but tops of the meal nicely. Good value meal."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is the best of... the best of it's kind. As a restaurant/eatery that fuses chinese, mexican and jamaican all into the same metal dish to-go, Chino Bandido is a unique Phoenician experience. While you will not get any sort of memorable experience from the decor, what you will remember is the intricate coded system of ordering from their enigma-menu, and the way your dish looks when it comes out with mexican beans, jerk chicken, red jade pork, and fried rice. If you love the basic combination of Meat + Rice, this is heaven.

If you want Jamaican jerk chicken and pork fried rice thrown into a burrito - do it.

You can look at the overhead board menu and choose from the basic options, but the real Chino Bandido experience occurs when you take a second to learn the menu code, and create your own combo. Choose two numbers 1-12 as meat, then either black or refried beans, then from a selection of rice - pork, chicken, fried, jerk, spanish - oh, and if you want it just thrown into the metal tin, or prepared as a burrito or quesadilla... Yeah, don't just order the #2. Make something your own.

The space is nearly as large as a school cafeteria and the tables would fit perfectly in that setting. Grab a pen and menu from the ordering counter and sit down with your party while you fill it out neatly and circle the items you want. Hand it over when you order and that's it. They'll decipher the code and bring you your food.

The Chandler location has free WiFi, and you'll see a good number of IT personnel at lunch, sitting with their laptops and 'working'.

The food at Chino Bandido is really good. Especially for how much you get for the low price. There isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. While some describe this as a 'fusion' of the three types of food, it's honestly not that. Just because you throw them in the same bowl, that doesn't make it fusion. Chino Bandido fulfills cravings, all of them, all at once. Want chinese or mexican or a little jamaican? Right now? Okay! Go here. Although not better than most actual restaurants, Chino Bandido is definitely better than most fast lunch spots. I could seriously eat here everyday for a few months and not have the same dish.

As far as a uniquely Phoenix experience, it is that, but it's not a must. When they start to actually create items and mashing things together... then it'll be a Phoenix Must. Until then, it's just one of the best quick lunches you can get."}
{"text":"Simply not worth the hype from what they received online. It is good food I will give them that but that is what it was good not great or spectacular. It was very busy and somehow the food was out in minutes very fast but the black beans are lacking in serious flavor and the rice is loaded with green onions. There are some who will love this mix of food but for me I guess I missed on the greatness that so many rave about."}
{"text":"I crave the Green/Jade Marinade at least once a month! So far the best Triple DDD location I've been to."}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekend lunches when I want to stuff myself for under 10 bucks. I usually get jade red (fried orange chicken with spice) and machaca (shredded beef with spices) or the pollo diablo (not batterred but lightly fried chicken with spices) all the fried rices are about the same the jerk chicken and jerk rice use black pepper as oppossed to chili for the spice. You get a nice doughy cookie as well for about 8.50"}
{"text":"Chinese food on a tortilla?!  Who would have thought it would be this good.  I love that you can ask for a sample if you are not sure of what to order.  You have to go just for the experience!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Chino Bandido on a Food Network show, and the fare sounded interesting. Mexican food with an Asian flare? Either horrible or awesome, right? 

Top Dog: Emerald Chicken - Brimming with the the flavors of green onions and ginger, this chicken was my favorite. I had it in a burrito, and immediately made me regret the other things I'd ordered.

Contendor: Jade Chicken - Interesting, but ultimately unsuccessful. It just tasted like someone put sriracha sauce on my tacos. Nah. Nothing special.

Surprising: Confusing order system - The system makes sense, but it takes a few minutes to figure out. They should just have newbies order at the counter with no paper. There's a whole matrix, and abbreviations, and about 30 options times four... It was surprising that it was so difficult to order.

Disappointing: Chile relleno - this was a bummer; chile rellenos are one of my faves, but this was a monstrosity; poor choice of cheeses, the batter was waaay too crunchy, not many seasonings. No thanks.

Overall, some good tastes, but room for improvement. Biggest improvement would be less grease. EVERYTHING was super greasy!  The fried rice was greasy, the beans were lardy, the food was oily, and the grease settled at the bottom of the foil container, getting the tortillas greasy and the rice greasier too!

I'd return, but I'd stick to the Emerald chicken."}
{"text":"The person I went with had a lot of food allergies and the owner was very accommodating. She knew exactly what was in the food. Anyone with food allergies knows what a blessing it is when the chef/ owner knows everything about everything. A+ for that. 

Negatives:

It took 15 minutes just to understand the flippin' menu. If you're new, prepare to get ushered to the sample tray where you'll get a tutorial on how to fill out the order card (which still makes no sense), then you'll be herded back in line where you finally pay and order. It's overkill for a restaurant geared towards the lunch crowd. Hell, it's overkill for any restaurant! Ordering should never be that complicated.

I found everything to be too salty, over fatty, or over fried. The novelty of the place wasn't enough to make me enjoy the food. 

I figured the burrito would be a good bet because it takes a lot to mess that up. The owner recommended the black beans but unfortunately they came out runny. The taste and consistency was more of a dip or side dish than anything else. The beany-soupy burrito fell apart after one bite. Bummer! 

The side of rice was also equally as disappointing, as the rice seasonings weren't mixed. The bottom of the dish was just plain white rice and it had no taste. 

Even with all of that, because it's an interesting concept, the owners are accommodating, and most people LOVE the food (I'm sure I'm in the minority). If you're into a salty, greasy Mexican/Asian food, you can probably overlook the confusing ordering system and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my top picks in Phoenix!

The creative twist to the proteins with Asian and Mexican is awesome!"}
{"text":"okay - we CRAVE this place - it's probably one of our favorite places to go when we have a free afternoon.   the strip mall that it's located in is pretty sketchy, but the food is totally worth it - you'll see!  I've converted tons of my friends to be Chino fans and they are all hooked, too!!  Go in and tell them you've never been in before and they'll hook you up with samples and help with the ordering process (it took me awhile to master that one). The emerald chicken quesadillas are to die for!!!  love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"anyone who's either mexican or is married to someone who's mexican knows one of the world's great hidden truths: mexicans love chinese food. maybe it's the fact that historucally mexico has had a high amount of chinese immigrants (mexicali, baja california used to be 91% chinese) or maybe it's the fact that both populations have had a history of being used as cheap imported labor and then kicked out of the US (Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, here we come again!) but there's no denying that when mexican families go out for a nice dinner, there will be chop suey involved.

i think the owner of Chino Bandido is somehow in on this secret, and has exploited this to great effect. they figured out that orange chicken, refried beans, and fried rice do, in fact, go great together.

don't think too much about it, just go there and try anything. tell the person at the counter that it's your first time there, and they'll give you free samples."}
{"text":"Years ago I used to live just a few miles from here and was introduced to it by a friend of a friend. They feature a mash up of Mexican and Chinese food, with some Caribbean-style food thrown in for good measure. My favorite back in the gluten-eating days was the Jade red chicken and chile relleno plate. Well, lucky for me I can still have the chicken! In fact, Chino has a gluten free menu with about 8 entrees and a few sides available. I have family in Phoenix, so I try to sneak over for a meal when I can!

Sadly, I can no longer eat the amazing, incredible snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal. I have been trying to replicate this cookie gluten free for years."}
{"text":"Took a trip to AZ for spring training and made a stop at Chino Bandido due to all the reviews and excitement from Diners Drive-ins & Dives. Not more to say than this will be a place we eat at every time we are in the Phoenix area!

My husband and I shared a white rice bowl with black beans, a emerald chicken quesadilla & a jade chicken quesadilla. It may sound odd but it was so yummy! The white rice mixed with the mexican black beans was great! And the flavors of the chinese style chicken inside the mexican cheese quesadilla were perfect.

Since I live in CA, I will be trying this at home to satisfy the odd craving and prove to friends I am not crazy."}
{"text":"Very cool little spot! Here visiting from LA and a friend recommended this place a Mexican/Chinese restaurant.  Guy Fieri has been here so figured why not.  Tried the two item combo sweet and sour chicken combo and it was good!!!! My second item was a chile relleno burrito and it came with white rice and beans, great food, good prices....def going to try this place again!"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this Chino Bandido location, after having been spoiled by their more upscale Chandler location.  Hole in the wall does not even begin to describe this place, with plastic tables and chairs and a blower on the door (like my elementary school had) to keep out flies (which it doesn't).   Like other restaurants that have been featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives, this place has taken their success from the show and allowed them to be pretty complacently lazy and unchanging in regards to items featured in their repertoire. 

The food, however, is always great, whether I get the Teriyaki Chicken burrito or the Jade Red Pork (my personal favorite) it comes out great every time, in both locations.  They do, as mentioned, always give you a cookie with your meal, they are snickerdoodles, and they are GOOD.  Bold letters good!

So yes, go to Chino Bandido, but get it to go."}
{"text":"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.

I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. 

Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. 

The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. 

They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. 

Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day."}
{"text":"I like Mexican food and I like Chinese food, so why not? Interesting menu. The Jade Red Chicken is as good as any Orange or General Tso's you'll find, and I like that there is a wide variety of choices here. Good food, especially if you like spicy!

I have one beef with this restaurant, and that is the cleanliness. Walking in, you'll notice that the decor and general feel of the place is very low budget. Uncomfortable seating, very weathered ceilings, and generally messy. No big deal. But the restrooms were disgusting, the eating area was dirty, and the trash was overflowing. The place was busy, but there's no excuse for the condition of the men's restroom! It looked like something (or someone) exploded in a truck stop restroom on a state highway. I would have chalked it up to a busy night, but the door and walls were filthy (almost black) with handprints from weeks (if not months) of neglect. All but one of the trash bins were over-stuffed, and most of the tables were dirty. We didn't see anyone cleaning anything. I'm glad I didn't go into the restroom until after I ate!

If it were my business, I would put at least a few dollars toward general maintenance and upkeep. Maybe even invest in a few nicer tables & chairs. If it were close to clean, I'd give at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't really know how to describe the food besides very flavorful with a home cooked kinda lovey feel about it.  It's just a place you have to try regardless of what you have read and ignore the hype. Just try it for yourself!

Go in, look at the pictures. Ask questions if your not sure. Our first time, we told them it was our first time and they walked us through the entire menu and let us taste a couple things. Order, pay, go sit down. The food comes in a to-go type tin dish which was great for me since I always get to excited and over order because I can't decide. 

Most of all though, don't go because you saw it on TV. Go because you want to eat something just a little bit different."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is like I'm at a Mexican/Chinese/Jamaican restaurant..... cuisine could be better."}
{"text":"Chino Bandido is like no where you have ever been.  Being able to get Asian style food wrapped in a tortilla with a side of beans and jerk fried rice....simply spectacular."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place and when I walked in I could tell it was popular but I went right up to the counter.  I told the guy I'd never been there before so he offered samplers of their popular items.  But then I was confused.  The menu is Chines style pictures on the wall, but the guy was describing a combo platter.  So the menu presentation is horrible (for newbies).  Then when I finally figured out what to order, he went into explaining how to order next time with all their shorthand- even more confusing- and the assumption is that I'd be eating there every day.  BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I can't believe my mother in law lives like a mile from here.  Now when my wife says she wants to visit her mom, I'll be mor enthusiastic about making the trek!"}

....well, I'm part of that group that Brian worked with and religiously make our way to Chino Bandino from Tempe to Phoenix, way before the Chandler location.

I was in Phoenix for Christmas and somehow Chino came up.  My brother's ear perked up and a smile came across his face at the prospect of Mexican and Chinese together.

We went on the day after Christmas and it was the quietest I've ever seen the place.  Fine with me...more for me!  As usual, everything was tasty.  

Oh, how I love you Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla and black beans.  I just can't quit you!

And the snickerdoodles, of coure, I love you too!"}
{"text":"I got a combo to go and it was prepared quickly. I went at a less busy time when there wasn't a line. The cashier guy wasn't very friendly. But the girl who gave me my to go meal was nice and helpful in putting my sauces and such in the bag before she tied it closed. They should put the less friendly people in back where they don't need to talk to anyone. And put the friendly people at the registers since that's the first impression people get and it sets the mood for their experience on that particular visit.

It's good to see they are not charging the Visa/Mastercard fee. That may be because they had a really bad experience when they first tried charging 25 cents extra for charge many years ago. If they are charging the extra fee now, they MUST display in an obvious location near the register that they are adding the credit card use fee.  Otherwise that would be in violation of the Visa/Mastercard policy with merchants.

So, be sure to check your itemized receipt and ask for it."}
{"text":"The novelty of Chinese/Mexican and the TV appearance must be the explanation for why this place is so popular.  Everything I had was very, very average.  Menu items were reasonably priced, but then when my portions arrived it was a little disappointing (1 burrito is not going to fill your stomach at lunch).  So, keep in mind you'll be ordering several items, or going home hungry.

Cleanliness was somewhat of an issue, but I think it's partly beause it is in a run-down strip mall and seems like a run down atmosphere inside.  There was an employee actively cleaning tables but it just didn't feel right in there."}
{"text":"My bother in law went on and on about how good this food was, and it did not disappoint. We drove way out of our way to get here BUT totally worth it."}
{"text":"I followed other yelper's advice and drove out of my way today to visit this dive.  My husband and I shared a combo that included the diablo chicken and jade chicken (burrito and quesadilla respectively) with black beans and the pork fried rice.  Everything was very good...the diablo was spicy, so make sure that that is your thing.  All the fried rice likely is cooked in lard, so that's good to know if you're vegetarian.  I really enjoyed the true fusion nature of this restaurant.  Where I come from, you just can't find this.  We will definitely return."}

{"text":"I ate here for dinner last night, and again for lunch today. I'd go back for dinner tonight, but it's 4:30pm, and I'm STILL FULL FROM LUNCH.

For dinner, I had a combination with black beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, and machaca. One of the best $8 dinners I've ever had. The machaca was tender and flavorful. The jade red chicken was not overly sweet, but had a tangy flavor that I really liked. The cashier who gave me samples said that it was like a sweet-and-sour, but I think it was a little closer to an orange or General Tso's chicken. I've never had jerk fried rice before, but I definitely approve.

For lunch today, I had another combo. This time it was a jerk chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, plain fried rice, and black beans. Jerk. Chicken. Quesadilla. You heard me. Jerk. Chicken. Quesadilla.

The jerk chicken has a subtle heat that slowly builds as you eat it. It won't scorch your lips, but it'll make you feel loved on the inside.

Bonuses: 
- free cookies. Who doesn't like a cookie?
- free wifi. Nuff said.
- incredibly friendly staff who don't mind explaining their menu to n00bs like me.
- samples!

My only regret is that I have to leave town tomorrow, and I don't think I could eat another bite tonight. It's truly one of the most unique restaurant concepts I've ever tried, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm hoping I'll get another job assignment in the area so that I can try a machaca/black bean/jerk fried rice burrito.

My advice: go eat here before the southern conservatives shut it down because they hate \"mixing\"."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place?

I used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed, the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be. 

Just to illustrate this point, I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a \"wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just \"wassup\" with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least. 

After ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait, and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long, staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind. 

After my long wait, and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends, it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance, just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.

By no means should you go here, unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!"}
{"text":"Alright Chino-- let's have a heart to heart. I LOVE Chino Bandido, but given the choice, I'll choose the original hole-in-the-wall location at 19th Avenue and Greenway  every time. I've been to both more times than I can count, and the experience at this location is sub-par every time.

This location is bigger, brighter, and more modern. But what it gains in space it definitely loses in charm. Service is slow-- totally understandable when the place is packed, but no matter how empty the dining room is, wait times are consistently high. In theory, the menus are the same, but somehow the food is never quite as good. I've had lukewarm food here on too many occasions. On my last visit, my fried rice was either grossly undercooked, or had been allowed to sit in a warmer entirely too long... either way, it was dry and crunchy. It's really sort of heartbreaking.

As a Phoenix native transplanted to Tucson, I make a habit out of sharing Chino with everyone I know, and I've turned several out-of-towners on to their food. Geographically speaking, this location works out to be more convenient when headed to or from Tucson, which is pretty much the only reason I go here at all. I'd love to see this location make a few adjustments to bring itself up to the level of the original."}
{"text":"This is Mexican Panda Express, and it is crazy. Crazy, and crazy delicious. Located in a strip mall, just look for the huge \"Panda bandit\" cartoons on the window.

Choose your \"meat\" -- the popular items like \"Jade Chicken\" is essentially a spicy version of orange chicken. Emerald chicken, a runner up, is boiled chicken with a minced ginger, scallions oil based sauce -- which is better with rice than in a tortilla since it's not as salty.

Then, throw that into a burrito, taco, or have it with rice and beans \"remix.\" The beans have been flavored with hoisin or oyster sauce to give it a sweet, umami tang. There's also \"jerk fried rice\" which is... rich, spicy and a great contrast to the meat dish. 

Finishes with a large snickerdoodle cookie, which was a little out of place, but hey, cookies!

Cafeteria style seating, order and sit down and they'll bring the food to you. At 8-10 bucks per meal, it's quite a steal, and a must try if you find yourself in Arizona."}
{"text":"The only reason this place isn't a 5 is because this place looks run down. But the food is amazing. Don't forget the snickerdoodle cookie that they give you. They let you try samples of what you might want to order. Must try."}

Love this place. Such a unique idea! I've been coming here since I was little to the Chandler location and I'm super bummed that it closed :(

{"text":"This place is awesome! Especially the Jerk Fried Rice and Jade Chicken. Don't worry about not knowing what you like, they let you sample everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for this place, which should have helped my rating but it was actually worse than expected. The food was bland and just tasted bad. They give you samples before you order which is a bad business decision on their part because we almost walked out at that. We ordered dishes besides the ones we had samples of and ended up throwing out half our food and leaving. They do have decent black beans but only in comparison to the rest of their food, not to other restaurants that serve beans."}
{"text":"A lot of excellent dishes to choose from. Definitely a place to bring your friends and family."}
{"text":"OMG so good! Unbelievable! Machaca was Amazing, the whole meal was. Love it!! And the cookie. 

We found this on yelp and today we have a new favorite! Great place, we will be back often.  First timers, make sure you ask to sample and take your time, there is so many good ones."}
{"text":"this place is a local favorite but I have either heard people that love it or hate it. I love it. I stick to my favorites as I'm done exploring the menu. their carnitas are not bad their jade red chicken is great. the jerk fried rice is delicious and u always gotta get the black beans! the atmosphere is not the best the employees are nice but the place needs a remodel. it reminds of a soup kitchen. it's totally worth the wait and the environment too!"}
{"text":"Though I like Chino Bandito's but the food is so greasy it makes me feel icky thinking about it now.  They got the fusion down ok, they just need to take the grease down a few notches."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place after subconsciously avoiding it for years. I mean I drove by it with curiosity several times but could not wrap my mind around Asian-Mexican-Caribbean fusion..  It's also in an old unassuming strip-mall north of the busy 19th ave and Greenway intersection.  In fact some people who I trust told me it was so so or not their \"cup of tea\".  A colleague/work friend mentioned it last week and said she always wanted to try it.  We decided to head down at lunch time(about 11am) and there were already people gathered around the door which was a good hint about the food.  Once inside I noticed that it was not really that impressive with very basic tables and chairs and not much in the way of decor.  A nice young lady at the \"ordering station\" caught me up to speed on how to fill out the order card which got my mind wondering about all of the various combinations you can have.  She also let me know about making an item into a burrito or a quesadilla.  I played it safeand ordered the Jade Red Chicken-Emerald Chicken combo with chicken fried rice and refried beans.  The Jade Red Chicken was fried and glazed  in a sweet and spicy sauce. Pretty much comfort food at it's best.  It had just enough crunch to go away with the great flavor.   The Emerald Chicken was a tender grilled chicken dish prepared with green onions and a ginger sauce.  Amazingly different than my other item yet it seemed to go well with the rice and beans.  As we began to finish our lunches(quite fast I might add), we all began acknowledging that it was really pretty good and you could not beat the prices. All of our entrees were under $10 which is cheap these days.  All and all I was very impressed and cannot wait to get back up there and try the jerk chicken, quesadilla, and chile relleno.  Overall I was not super impressed with the aesthetics of the restaurant but that does not seem to be the point of this place..  I can see how some would not like it because it is a little different but it definitely appealed to the taste buds and a place I would recommend to anyone.  Just don't expect a fancy joint!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place.  I was iffy about the whole Mexican and Asian food mix, but it's perfect! The staff is really friendly. If you're new they'll give you samples and suggestions to help you choose. The food is amazing! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love Chino! I am a really picky eater and don't do a lot of whole in the wall spots but Chino is by far one of my favorite chill spots to eat. I usually order to go though. I love the quesadilla, jerk chicken (or jerk fried rice), and black beans."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chino's for 15+ years, I don't remember when I started there.  A good friend ran a paperback book store just south and Chino's was a regular stop for us for lunch or for dinner afterwards before spending an evening gaming or watching movies.  The 19th Ave location has expanded twice since I started going there.

Chino's is an amazing place, and has been featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  The owners, Eve and Frank, are great people.  In fact, meeting Eve for the first time was an interesting experience: she started staring at me and asked \"Do you have a brother named Rick?\"  I replied yes.  \"Did you go to Sunnyslope?\"  I replied yes.  I didn't think I looked that much like my brother that she could identify me through him.  It was amusing, unfortunately it's been quite a while since I've seen her and Frank, I heard they're mainly working in the Chandler location.

Chino's is restaurant with an interesting structure.  If you're new, walk up to the counter and tell them that you're a newbie and they'll give you samples of all of their meats.  You then choose to have your meat with a rice & beans bowl, or in a quesadilla or burrito, or you get a combo plate where you can get two meats, by themselves or in burritos or quesadillas with rice and beans.  The beans are refried or black, the rice can be white, fried, chicken fried, pork fried, or jerk fried.

It's just great stuff.

Myself, I prefer the jade red chicken and frequently get it in a burrito with black beans.  Eve was very skeptical every time I ordered my burrito, then one day she made one for himself and decided it as pretty good.

One thing that's been cool is their weekends.  On week days, you get a snickerdoodle cookie for dessert, on the weekends they have specialty cookies like a lovey chocolate bomb called a volcano cookie.  They also do butterscotch cookies, and probably one or two that I can't name.  The weekends also have on offer black bean tostadas, which are awesome.  And you can buy the cookies by the dozen to take for later consumption.

I wouldn't say that Chino's is infinite diversity in infinite combinations, but pretty darn close.  Well worth the time, but expect long waits if you go there at dinner time Friday or Saturday.  Lunches can also get slammed by engineers from Honeywell (or whatever they're called this week), your best chances for fast service is in off-peak hours.  They also are frequently closed on holidays, so plan accordingly.  It can also be quite noisy when it's full, so don't be surprised."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the hype myself and was not disappointed! Went with my sister for a Saturday lunch and shared a combo meal. We got the Jade Red Chicken in a quesadilla and the Jen Red Pork with Jerk Fried Rice and Refried Beans. The chicken was perfectly battered and crispy. Eating it in the quesadilla was honestly life changing. 11/10 would recommend. The pork was just as delicious, but I regret not getting it in the quesadilla as well. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"If you don't love this place, you have problems. It's a dive. It's delicious. The prices are pretty decent. It's unique. It's delicious. It's fun. It's delicious. Portions are big. And it's pretty delicious. You can sample a lot of their food before making a selection. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, but the service could use a little more pep. The location is terrible, it's packed behind a strip-mall off of the main roads. 

The food, as I said, is delicious. I recommend the Jade Chicken, it doesn't fit well into the quesadilla, but if you get it in a burrito is it perfect. It's a sweet and sour type sauce with fried chicken, it is said to be their specialty. I definitely enjoyed it, we'll continue to come back here regularly."}
{"text":"Totally surprised. This place was amazing I got the mix jade and jerk with dirty rice yum!!  Great food, even down to the beans. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I used to joke about this place when I was in high school because a classmate worked here and this place had a funny name. I wish I hadn't because it meant I missed eating here for many years.

My wife likes to watch Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network and this restaurant was featured on the program a few years ago and we liked what we saw. We tried it out, liked it and have been going ever since. There is even an autographed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall but it seems quite a few people dislike him...

There are plenty of options to choose from and what's great is that you can get samples before you order. I tried the Jerk chicken and it was possibly the spiciest thing I have ever tasted and was glad I didn't order it. Instead I found something I really do like and that's the Jade Red Chicken. I get it on plain fried rice with a Chile Relleno and it's mighty tasty. They also give you a freshly baked cookie although you don't usually give you an option of what kind. More often than not it's a snickerdoodle.

I've also picked it up to go on several occasions and I live about 20 minutes away and the food is still hot by the time I get home.

The location itself seems to have grown a bit, taking over the adjacent storefronts to expand their dining room. This place is frequently busy so this was a good move. Unfortunately it's also a hole in the wall where you sit at cheap tables and chairs and sometimes the staff doesn't always get around to cleaning the tables after someone else used them. My wife doesn't care for eating in the dining room for this very reason and she prefers to get it to go.

There used to be a location on the southeast corner of Dobson and Chandler Boulevard in Chandler but it was way in the back of a strip mall hidden behind another strip mall and few people knew about it. That location was never busy so I'm not surprised it closed.

It may seem seem strange to mix Chinese and Mexican cuisine but it works. In the case what I order, it is definitely different to eat cheese with Chinese food but I like it. This place was doing fusion before it became popular and had become an institution here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ate at the one in Chandler...meh!

Food was ok, but nothing special. 

Not sure what all the hype is about.

I liked the cookie though."}
{"text":"Great Idea and cheap prices.  The food was surprisingly good as well, and you get a lot of it.   I would definitely recommend checking out the place if you have never been there.  i do however think that the food quality was lacking a little, and the restaurant was empty.  A little more care in their implementation of the concept and this place could be 5* quality."}
{"text":"DDD brought me here and left me disappointed yet again. I'm starting to think the DDD spots ain't really spots at all.

Chino Bandido is supposed to be Mexican and Chinese fusion, but the only fusion is in the style of food, and not the flavor palate. For example, offering quesadillas doesn't really make the food \"Mexican\" in anything other than face value. Heck, in that case, I'd be a pro chef of Mexican food.

I ordered the \"popular\" item here, the red jerk chicken plate. It comes with a snickerdoodle cookie, which wasn't soft at all and hence, ended up being a hard pass. Sorry--I know there are some hardcore fans of those cookies; to each her own. I was hoping the redemption would come in the food, but it ended up being a slight modification of orange chicken from Panda Express. Yes, I said it. Panda Express. My friends and I originally thought this place must have hit it off because there was no Panda Express in Phoenix. But nope, a quick google search evinced that Panda Express was less than 5 miles away from Chino Bandido. So what's with the hype here? I think it comes down to Guy Fieri. 

The service was great, but not great enough to drag me back here. Once is enough!"}
{"text":"Love this place and at times forget about it when thinking of what to eat.  I always order their 2 item dish:  jade red chicken, emerald chicken with fried rice and refried beans.  Their bean and cheese burrito is also pretty amazing even though it's small - but it's so good.  The place on Greenway is a hole in the wall and you almost have to know how and what to order when you approach otherwise you may get the stink eye."}
{"text":"The first time someone told me about this place like twenty years ago I was like, \"Ewhhhhhhhhh, Really? Mixed Chinese and Mexican food? GROSS!\" However,  it works and many menu food items are very good. I am not a fan of Mexican food in general but I like most of the food here. The Jade chicken Quesadilla is my favorite.

I know this is random but they have the best Black Beans in Az. In fact I have a friend who says they are the best in America. She has tried them all over the world and always thinks theirs are the best. She has to have them every so often. Random number two, who knew? Their Snickerdoodles are the best I have found out of NY or a bakery. I know, very random."}
{"text":"You betcha previous reviewers! Oh so good!Oh so weird!Oh so politically  incorrect name and Panda Bear decor, But that's half the fun!  The black beans are great. They have the best snickerdoodles I ever had out of a bakery. Beware your stomach may get upset, if it tends to be sensitive. The food can be a bit greasy depending on what you order."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. Everybody raves about this place including my friend who brought me. I just didn't think anything was that good. I will give chino bandido another chance eventually, hopefully I have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I was hoping I would like this place better, but that is not so.  After telling my husband that I was feeling particularly inclined to eat either Mexican ( a rare occurrence for me ) or Chinese food, he suggested Chino Bandido.  After a little bit of research on the internets I decided that there was something suitable for me there.

At first glance, the place looks seedy.  Upon closer inspection, it just looks dirty.  That didn't really bother me as some of the best food can come from the not so best looking conditions.  They haven't been shut down, so how bad can it be?  The way of ordering food here is a bit too complicated, you feel like you're taking a pop quiz you aren't prepared for.  The little sheet of paper you use to order just doesn't have very good instructions.  However, the girls working here were all very nice and helpful, and more than willing to dole out samples to anyone interested.  

I finally ordered the Jade Red Chicken with plain fried rice.  The rice definitely seemed like a fusion of the Asian and Mexican with the style being Chinese, but the flavor being very Mexican.  The chicken itself was rather tough, definitely not a high quality.  The crispiness of the batter was really good though.  The sauce that makes this Jade Red was described as sweet and sour with a kick.  Well, I missed the sweet and sour flavor.  It was more along the lines of just kick.  Now, I understand I have a low tolerance for spices, but this was over the top for me.  I will be back next time I am congested.  The snickerdoodle they served with your meal is the bomb though.  Yum.

Overall, I am not really impressed.  Creative, but not something I'm really feeling.  I think I may check out the Chandler location to give this place another shot.  A pretty decent place that I guess is worth checking out, if only to laugh at the giant strapped panda bear statue inside."}
{"text":"If its your first time there, they will give you a sampling of their food... and trust me, you'll want to stay to eat. The staff is super friendly, the food is great AND you get a Snickerdoodle cookie with your meal that melts in your mouth. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chinese Mexican Food fused together to make it work.

No frills restaurant that could probably use a facelift, order at the counter and they bring out the food to you.

The most difficult thing is figuring out how and what to order, would recommend a Quesidilla and a burrito.  I think the best thing they have is the Jade Red Chicken. Can't go wrong with this item, it is not too hot but has good flavor, this works well in a Quesidilla,  burrito or just over Rice. 

Lines can be long during lunch time but are generally quick, such a wide variety to order with a multitude of combinations. 

Tip I ab to fill out the order before going in line so you don't hold up other people."}
{"text":"I ate here a month ago and am certain that it gave me the worst food poisoning of my life. I kinda want to give it another chance because everyone I know loves it so much... But I am haunted by the memories of pooping my guts out for 8 hours straight that I will never trust the Chinese Bandit again. Eat here with caution."}
{"text":"I went here in November with a really large group and loved the concept. I got the jerk chicken which burned my face off, so when I went back last night I decided to not get that. I was with my kid, and I ordered her a teriyaki chicken. I got myself the Jade Red Chicken because it was suppose to be the best.

The cashier said it would be awhile because there were a lot of people. I said that should be ok, and figured maybe it would be 20 minutes. Forty-five minutes later he brought our food. Hers was a bowl of whiterice with way too much teriyaki sauce all over it. There was NO Chicken at all! I took it back and they dumped cold chicken slices across the top and put on even more sauce. My Jade Red Chicken was dry, overdone and crunchy. Terrible.

And it wasn't even until I got home that I realized they didn't remember to give us our cookies!

I give it 2 stars because the concept is really cool and they have free wifi. Those are the only reasons."}
{"text":"Unique dishes and such amazing food. The place doesn't look like much at first glance but we've never been disappointed with the food or service. The only thing I'd change is the way they have you order, for a first timer the order slip can be confusing (friends recently came home with a dozen cookies they didn't mean to order, not that I'm complaining, yum!)."}
{"text":"The food is good for a first time visit but if you know meat, you will figure out that there is higher quality meat out there for the same price. The Portion sizes seem to have gone down considerably from when I first started going there and I am sure other people might have noticed this too. I love their cheesed up quesadilla but somehow I am still hungry when I leave. One worst turn down for my wife is the cleanliness issue. Don't look at the floor while you eat since it might kill your appetite."}
{"text":"Friendly, polite staff. If you tell them it's your first time there, they will give you samples. The food is great and served fast. I will definitely go back and will recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Its hard to ignore the greatness of Mexican food and Asian food exploding in your mouth!  Chino definitely hits my TOP 5 lunch spots in all of Arizona!  
Jade Red, BBQ Pork, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken.....to go along with the best Black Beans and Pork Fried Rice ever...get out of here!  Its amazing. 
And the Snickerdoodle at the end might just be the best part.  
Sold!"}
{"text":"I went a while back and was excited from all the big talk on how great this place is. Unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry and the rice and beans I could have made better at home with more flavor..... Maybe it was a bad day or something not sure.... I almost threw the food in the garbage..... hopefully they can improve... it could have been a off day...."}
{"text":"I love the Chandler location. It was just a little bit better than this. But this is still amazing. You've got your Mexican Asian fusion Cuisine. A dish worthy of a MasterChef invention."}
