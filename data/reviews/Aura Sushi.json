{"text":"This place is just not very good.  Out of the 3 places in this (kinda sketchy) food court, it is easily the worst.  I've tried rolls and nigiri here twice.  I should have known better than to go back a second time, but I thought I'd give it another chance.  It is immediately beside an extremely popular place (Kaiju) and gets maybe 1 customer for every 30 that go to Kaiju.  The low turnover means that your sushi will not be very fresh.  If you are in the Aura food court and want sushi, you are better off going to the Korean \"Sushi BBbop\" place across the way.  Much better quality, higher turnover, and friendly owners too."}
{"text":"I went in on a fairly busy night. It was my first time, and my first impression was the authentic Japanese bar on the left along with a modern and tidy decor. The service was fast and friendly.   The food itself was amazing. It took us a while to get through the menu becasue there were so many options, but we decided on a rainbow roll, a dragon roll, a california roll and some shrimp tempura. I was very impressed with the quality of what we were getting for our money. It was plated nicely, and it was high quality stuff. So delicious.  Also indulged in the deep fried banana with mango ice cream after. Perfect way to end off the meal. Really great place overall, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Aura sushi makes fresh sushi for a good price. It is a bit inconvenient to get to, being at the bottom of the Aura complex but no doubt that residents of the complex and surrounding area will get to know this place in time."}
{"text":"I placed an order today at 7pm on a Monday evening. The order was $40 in total - a mixture of basic rolls & one chicken yakitori.  We were enticed in by the 20% off deal, however I can assure you that 20% is not enough off to warrant the service & experience we received.   The food was delivered at 8:50pm, 1 hour after the predicted delivery time. Over the two hours I called the restaurant 3 times to be told 'it is on the way'. The final time I called they informed me that the delivery drivers phone had run out of battery, which I could let go. However, when the driver finally arrived at my door he simply pointed to his receipt and told me that it was my fault for not putting the buzzer number on the receipt.   Our building, like most, has a concierge who could have comfortably let him in - but this is not the end of the experience. Upon calling the restaurant afterwards to let them know how stone cold our Chicken Yakisoba is, the gentleman at the end of the phone told us it is our fault because the driver tried the back door of the building, which is why it was an hour late. The owner of the restaurant yelled at us down the phone as we asked for a refund, offering only to come and collect the food.  You have got to be kidding me? No refund offered, no way will we repeat this experience & quite frankly I am amazed that this place continues to receive orders."}
{"text":"Had not originally planned to eat here but I was in the feeling for something soupy. Saw a few of the pictures and decided to go for the beef curry udon soup. Food was cooked fresh. Didn't like that I could see that the udon noodles came from a bulk package that you could get at your local grocery store. Despite seeing that the udon noodles came from one of those instant udon noodle packages, the soup base was good. The beef were extremely thinly cut. Wasn't enough beef. Caramelized onions were a great addition but overall was an ok bowl. Wouldn't go back though."}
