{"text":"It's amazing place to have lunch and dinner in. My wife and I ordered brizol, samsa, eggplants rolls and beef sroganoff. The brizol is worh to give it a try. This place care about the product quality. I love it and i will visit it again and again. I think the next visit I will try the kebab."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The food was unique and the beef stroganoff on mashed potatoes was the best."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable.  Second time this month I've been here and I hope to come back again soon"}
{"text":"Pancake bags are everything. I get them every time I go. And the dumplings are fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The menu was broad, the dishes were interesting flavorful and beautifully prepared and served. Our waitress was lovely and sweet, a member of the Uzbekistani family. Especially wonderful were the eggplant roulette and the vegetable kasvar (with cheese). The salmon in the fish kasvar was overcooked in our opinion, though maybe that's how they do it in Uzbekistan. We had a thoroughly enjoyable dinner there and would become regulars if we weren't just passing through."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant! Though I had a better experience having the food delivered (I live in mt. wash) rather than eating in. It's a bit of a homely place...also keep in mind it's a Halal restaurant, so no alcohol!  I like the chicken kebobs as an appetizer and the Uzbek Palov is really good as well. I love the rice they serve with the palov.   The second time I went, I got the beef stroganoff, and while it was really tasty, there were way too many fries. They put the fries in the stroganoff, so they soak up all the sauce, and it's not good at all. I ate around all the fries, however, but definitely would not order again. My boyfriend got the lagman, which was super delicious. I think I'll try that next time.  This is a very unique experience, in my opinion, in a quaint and quiet restaurant. It's definitely very dated inside, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is a contemporary family style restaurant. Authentic delicious food. The lemon soufflé is a must try. We received excellent service and food recommendations. Unfussy simple food +reasonable price= happy eaters!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! The server was very entertaining and attentive!! Great value for the amount of food! Dinner was delicious! The fresh baked bread was awesome as were the pierogies. We tried multiple entrees and ate family style. Great ambience - very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Quiet, delicious , fast service and friendly staff .  Couldn't ask for anything more. My wife and I love to eat different foods from around the world. This place was a hit. Looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"Went to Kavsar expecting average Uzbek and was so surprised.  Authentic and the chef did it right!  If you like Uzbek this is the place to go in NE Ohio and NW Pennsylvania.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The place is a bit hard to find. Lots of winding roads to get there on Mt. Washington. There was only one host who was also the server for entire place !  She was very nice and some how kept her cool even when things were busy.  Egg plant rolls were ok. Bread was excellent. Tea was nice too. They only had beef kebab, but not chicken kebab. Beef kebab were too soft, undercooked and not well spiced. We never had Uzbek food before and initially thought this is how it's made. But later could see raw meat! Fried Beef stew with rice was decent.  Best part were bread, tea and service. Prices were mostly reasonable. Not sure will go there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me there for my birthday. Then I took my mom. Then my mother took my dad. Suffice it to say I think the food is awesome. It's incredibly different. You won't get food like this anywhere else in Pittsburgh I'm pretty sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I am from South Louisiana aka a cajun and we take pride in cooking as most know. This was my wife and I's first time dining at a Russian restaurant and boy they know what they are doing here in Pittsburgh. We started with the black tea, uzbek bread, chuchuvara andvareniki. This was followed up with a hearty serving of Lagman and dessert was cherry cake."}
{"text":"I went over the holidays and ordered takeout... This food is amazing. Truly, amazing. Fresh bread and home-cooking. I can't wait to go back, though I seldom find myself in this part of town.   Oh, man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about \"lagman\" the noodle dish."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because of 4.5 rating but the food is below average without any taste. They are just bland without any spice. Even the chicken is not well cooked bit hard and dry. We tried Gampan, Kavsar special chicken, bread and Samsa. Only Bread and Samsa were up to the mark. Gampan and Kavsar special chicken below average."}
{"text":"Very cute small charming place. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"I realize that if I give five stars that it may with some downgrade my rating, but I feel like a fool for not coming here sooner. It's about a half-mile from my home. The food is pure comfort and I'd rather come here than go to the Hyeholde or Le Mont. The food was fresh, delicious beyond my expectations and the people here are charming. What more could I ask from a little slice of heaven?"}
{"text":"Kavsar's food is absolutely delicious.  Our favorite dishes are the pumpkin manti and the Uzbek palov - beef and lamb are both fantastic.  We also love the music videos that play in the dining room.  The restaurant is pretty much what you'd expect in Mt. Washington; it's a converted house with steep steps up to the main dining area, but to me that's just part of its charm."}
{"text":"We enourmously enjoyed our visit to Kavsar. Staff is attentive and courteous. The food is delicious and healthy. This restaurant definitely beats many higher priced restaurants in terms of taste and service, and prices are very reasonable. I think it deserves a Michelin mention if not a full star (if somebody from their review team is reading this, definitely try it out!) This restaurant is a local gem worth bringing on our regular rotation. Looking forward to trying out their whole menu and bringing some friends!"}
{"text":"Very unusual interior with tablecloths and stuff but their food is amazing! You should definitely try borsh and their homemade bread"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this restaurant, I'm blown away by how delicious the food is!  I'm writing my review as I eat my lunch from Kavsar.  I ordered the Lagman and a small bread.  It's great fresh food seasoned to perfection!  It's also great to try seeing as we don't have anything else like this in Pittsburgh. If you're in Mt. Washington I highly recommend stopping by this cute little place for a bite of great decently priced food."}
{"text":"Ate here for a late lunch/early dinner. The food is really amazing! I would probably give it 4.5 stars because the service is a little slow at times, but the food is so good, it'll make you forget about that. To start, we had the carrot salad, the spicy cucumber salad, the house salad, and the oliv'e salad. They were all amazing!  For dinner, we had lagman, the mixed kabob platter, the manti w/spinach, and the kavsar lamb. They were all amazing! We all agreed that the lamb was the best we had ever eaten. I'm not from the area, but I will definitely come back to this place the next time I go to Pittsburgh.  Bottom line-- try this restaurant! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Going to this place was quite a trip itself for me, going up the hill on a wet, winding, and narrow roads with 2-way traffic. At least I didn't have to go around and around to find parking since it has a private parking lot just down the road by the 3-way intersection on top of the street parking. Ordered Uzbek bread, mushroom/potatoes samsa, and the Kavsar signature dish. The bread is very, very good: not so hard on the outside but very fluffy inside. It's a perfect compliment to dip on the signature dish sauce which was also good by itself. I gotta find friends in Pittsburgh the next time I'll go here since I definitely want to try the dimlama/beshbarmak which feeds 5 and have to be pre-ordered!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. The samsa and the borscht were great. I will be back for entrees.  The staff was really friendly . Good stuff. Get your butt up there !"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here while we were on vacation in Pittsburgh. Our family is Russian, and turns out that Uzbek has a lot in common with it. We ordered a bunch of sides to share, and we were really happy with everything. We ordered: bread, samsa, eggplant rolls, olivie salad, chicken + beef kababs,   The Olivie was slightly different from our family's version, but super delicious. The portion was also extremely generous - great for sharing. The eggplant rolls were light, and we have reproduced them pretty closely at home - yum. The only slightly negative thing about the food is that the kababs were so-so. Not well spiced and slightly overcooked.  The food was awesome, the service was slightly less so. We ordered bread, and it came long after we had eaten all the rest of our food. The waitress did not stop-by very often, so we had empty water glasses for most of the evening. Still did not detract from our evening too much, but this is something that might annoy other people."}
{"text":"At some point this summer you may find yourself admiring the gorgeous Pittsburgh skyline from Grandview Avenue on Mount Washington. You may even find yourself strolling down Shiloh Street for a drink or some late night food. You most likely, though will not find yourself stepping through a creaky doorway at the top of a ramp across from McGuinn's Barber Shop on Southern Avenue. But I am here to tell you that you should.   16 Southern Avenue is home to a cozy Uzbek eatery called Kavsar. When you walk inside you will be greeted by a cheery host with a pleasant Russian accent. She will ask you where you want to sit and you will most likely have many options. Although the space is small, I have never seen it close to crowded. I always choose a secluded room in the back where a black tablecloth with simple plate-ware lines a table set for six. The host will ask you how you are doing, what's new in your life, and so on. You begin to feel at home in this place, with traditional Uzbek music playing softly in the background. There are simple pieces of artwork on the walls and not much else to distract you from what is to come: the food. Oh, the food!   The menu is full of authentic Uzbek and Russian dishes; as your eyes scroll down the entrée list you may feel overwhelmed not being able to pronounce half of the plates. And then you will find yourself picking out words in the descriptions, like \"beef broth\", \"potato pancakes\", \"dumplings\", and \"chopped onions\" and thinking, \"well that sounds good. And so does that - and that, too.\" The host, who also serves as a waitress, will come back with a sweet grin on her face. She will ask you if you are ready to order - you won't be - she will give you more time and on her second round you will ask her for recommendations because there are too many delicious options running through your mind. The first time that I ate here, I could not decide if I wanted something sweet or savory. The same host suggested that I get a little bit of both...so, I did. The mashed potato / mushroom crepes and cherry crepes did not disappoint. Last night though I settled on the Eggplant Rolls and Manti stuffed with spinach and pumpkin. The host told me that this dish would take up to twenty minutes to prepare and I said, \"Give them as much time as they need\", knowing that time equals quality when it comes to the kitchen.   Eggplant Rolls: these thin pieces of eggplant dipped in a minimal batter had the texture of nothing I have ever tasted before. They are light and fluffy, almost melting on your tongue. I didn't know that eggplant could do that. Stuffed with tomatoes and onions and topped with dill, this appetizer was the perfect blend of textures and flavors.  Manti with spinach and pumpkin: when this plate came out, I was in awe. It was a gorgeous dish including three dumpling pieces with a green filling and three with an orange filling delicately placed in the shape of a circle; in the center stood a little dish of white dipping sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. I cut into a green Manti first and was delighted to find just the right amount of transparent dough to balance out the green spinach that it held. This dish was heavenly, requiring minimal chewing and involving maximal flavor. The pumpkin Manti was just as delightful, taking my mind back to images of Pennsylvania lighting up with the colors of fall.   Uzbekistan's location along the old Silk Road (an ancient network of trade routes connecting the West and East from China to the Mediterranean Sea) made it a crossroads for versatile cultures and cuisines. Kavsar's menu clearly reflects both Uzbekistan's history as a former Soviet Socialist republic, with strong Asian and Mediterranean influences.   It is impossible to choose a bad plate on Kavsar's menu. And, it is impossible to have a bad experience here. Why? Because this place has got everything right: tight-knit quarters in an intimate setting with authentic people cooking traditional dishes from their childhood. Kavsar feels more like coming home to your mother's house than it does eating out on Mount Washington. The next time you are craving an authentic twist on a home cooked meal, make your way up to Mount Washington for a stellar view and a secret dining spot. That is the beauty of a place like this. It's sweet and simple: a restored house sitting on a dimly lit residential street at an iconic location in a re-invented American city. I believe that Pittsburgh is the best-kept secret of the East Coast. And Kavsar may be one of the best-kept secrets of Pittsburgh. Keep your craving for adventure alive & do not allow yourself to be bored. Pittsburgh will not disappoint.   - xoxo, A (California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Uzbekistan food!  We will be back  again for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience dining here. I used yelp to choose this spot for dinner. Our hostess was great, food was good. Overall I had a good time dining here. Note for the owner is to grill when ordered instead of reheating it."}
{"text":"There is a talented performer that performs in many different languages other than English and does very well.  Food is delicious and unique. Tea is also very delicious and is of a quality that is difficult to find in the US."}
{"text":"The food was really good, and different from anything I've ever had before. I'd definitely recommend checking this quaint place out!"}
{"text":"We walked in on a busy Saturday night and they still accommodated us. The menu is pretty expansive but we had an idea about what we wanted to get. To start we got the homemade bread, which was dense and delicious, the Julien beef pockets, these were essentially stuff crepes but wrapped up like a massive dumpling and the Samsa which was really delicious. For our mains we got the Lamb Plov and Spinach Manti. The lamb was well cooked and melted in your mouth. The spinach manti's tasted like spinach dimsums. They were good since I'd not really had them before but I would definitely try something else the next time around.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, ALSO it's BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of wine if you want."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious homemade delicacies. I was looking for a restaurant near Allentown and Kavsar showed up in my search. I had no idea what to expect for an Uzbek restaurant and was very happily surprised. The interior decoration and layout of the downstairs is simple and a bit awkward, but don't be fooled -- the food more than makes up for the sparseness.   You have to start off with the bread as an appetizer: warm, flavorful, freshly made, I dare say this is the best restaurant bread I've had in a long time.  Drinks? Poor you. You have to choose between a refreshing berry juice (à la kompot), homemade iced tea, a fresh pot of loose leaf green tea, or ayran, a tangy, thin yogurt drink that's bound to do your digestive system wonders.  A great place to start are the Manti, which are delightful little stuffed dumplings that come with a dill-accented dipping sauce. Dill is used in a few dishes at this place, and I'm a huge fan.  Beyond that, the Oliv'e Salad (like your grandma's potato salad, but better), the marinated mushrooms (DILL!), the chicken kebab... all delicious. Why? Because you can tell it's homemade. All of it. It's the kind of hearty soul food that's sorely lacking in many a city's restaurant scene. We don't need more overpriced hipster startups or bland high-end restaurants selling variations on the same theme; we need more Kavsars."}
{"text":"A friend and myself stopped at Kavsar on Saturday night around 8:30 PM. We were the only people dining during our entire stay.  When you walk in there is a small bar (not sure if they serve alcohol) and a few tables.  The actual dining area is upstairs.  It's not the nicest restaurant I've ever been to but some of the best places I've at weren't the prettiest.  They had live music which consisted of someone playing soothing guitar music.  The performer was really good!  The service was prompt and knowledgable. The server answered our questions and gave us her favorites.  For dinner, I opted to try the Uzbek Palov and green tea with lemon.  The Palov consists of tender beef served with rice, tender carrots and scallions/onions.   Overall it was a very good dish, but I would have liked more meat in particular.  There were only a few pieces on top of the rice.  One option may be for $2-3 more adding more meat to the dish.  The tea was also very good.  For desert I opted for the honey cake based on the recommendation of our server.  It was good, but not really something I would normally try but I like trying different things.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant, especially since its not too busy."}
{"text":"This is not a friendly neighborhood establishment and I have concerns about their health code violations.  Whenever the weather is warm, the kitchen door is always open (no screen door) and you can see that they store food directly on the floor.  I have seen bags or rice and onions at different times.  One time the owner was standing on the entrance ramp yelling at a family that was parking their car in front of the restaurant.  He was telling them they couldn't park there if they weren't customers.  This area is metered, public parking but he harassed them until they moved.  In the summer, their gravel/grass parking lot is overrun with weeds and trash.  In the winter, they never clear their sidewalk of snow and ice. A place like this should be an asset to the area but instead it is a blemish and not frequented by locals."}
{"text":"Great find and unique food (for our party anyway) Service was great, we sampled and shared 4 dishes plus the homemade bread.  All were excellent with nice flavors"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Lovely people! Relaxed atmosphere amidst splendid ethnic decors. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this delicious spot earlier this year, and I am dying to return! Kavsar Restaurant serves Uzbek and Russian cuisine (including a special bread that's baked daily - more on that later). They use local ingredients as much as possible and make the majority of the food in house from scratch. And if my visit is any indication, everything is fantastic and worth having at least once!  I visited Kavsar with a group of people, so we were able to order a range of their homemade dishes and share them. I got to sample the eggplant roll, cottage cheese pancakes, the shurpa (a traditional soup with vegetables cooked in beef broth), and vareniki (dumplings described as \"the Russian version of pierogis\" on the menu). Oh, and we also ordered two loaves of that special bread to share.  Everything. Was. Amazing! \"Delicious\" doesn't begin to cover the goodness we were served. Every dish had a unique flavor profile, I think due to the combination of the cuisine itself plus the freshness of the dishes. I still dream about that bread sometimes, it was just SO good.  All the food we shared was super filling - but wait, there's more! The gang and I managed to make some room for some sweet baklava and the Russian Napoleon cake (a creamy baked delight that I wanted more of as soon as it disappeared). The desserts, unlike the main dishes, was store bought, but I have no complaints at all. A great dessert is a great dessert!  I cannot recommend this place enough - they are 100% worth an adventure up to Mt. Washington, even if you have to hunt for parking. Their atmosphere is homely, their service is great, and I obviously can't praise the food enough. Visit the nearby wine store to take advantage of their BYOB policy, then head on over and start dining!"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant yesterday. What a unique, delicious, and rare find  Pittsburgh! The service was great and the food was very tasty.  We had the samsa, palov and lagman . All hand made and delicious. My family and friends want to come back here soon !"}
{"text":"Hello, Pittsburgh City Paper review:  Based on your glowing, full-page review of Kavsar, I trekked up to Mt Washington to try it. I did not order the Lagman, but thought a more traditional Russian dish, like Beef Stroganoff, would be better to evaluate. This was the most insipid, tasteless crap I have ever encountered in my 50 plus years of restaurant hopping. It contained extremely bland cuts of very fatty beef, sitting on a bed of lumpy mashed potatoes, without any flavor. The watery so-called gravy contained no sour cream (which is the signature for a Stroganoff). The dish was sprinkled with a few chopped raw scallions and dill.THAT'S IT!!  I guess I still have not learned my lesson that reviews like yours and mouthwatering photos of online dishes do not in any way represent the quality of contemporary restaurant fare, especially in Pittsburgh. Oh how I wish I were back in New York!!  Jack"}
{"text":"Fresh carefully prepared meal. Delicious flavorful perfectly seasoned foods.  Eggplant rolls were great as well as the stuffed pancakes.  They were very delicate and tasty in beef. Homemade pierogies with garlicky sauce. Gracious helpful staff. Desperately needs a makeover and better lighting.  Worth every bite though...you won't be seeing it since your eyes will be rolling back in your head with delight. Visiting from Phila."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle was exactly how my grandma used to cook it- amazing!!! Carrot salad needs to be more spicy. Samsa and manti was great a must for great homemade Russian food while in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I studied abroad in St. Petersburg in the past, and came here hoping to get a nostalgic taste of Eastern European cuisine. Ended up finding my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Better than most of the places I've been to in Russia as well. The staff are all very friendly and I've never had a negative experience. There isn't an item on the menu that I wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very tasty. Unique decor & plates.  Reason of 4 stars is portions should have been bit more considering the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at Kavsar today!  We split an app of mushroom and chicken Julien Pancake bags, and they were great!  I had the pumpkin Manti dumplings, and my friend had Gampan, which is rice with chicken and Asian spices.  Both exceeded my expectations.  This was my first time trying Uzbek food, but I will definitely go back to try some other items on their interesting menu.  Our waitress was as nice and as sweet as could be!"}
{"text":"I'm a professional Russian eater, and this place did not disappoint.  Tried the spicy cucumber salad, fried eggplant, and Greek salad to start, which were all very tasty.  The entrees - beef stroganoff and their special chicken dish were a little bland, but to the non professional Russian eater would be enjoyable.  The service was great, bread is a must have, definitely recommend to all my comrades.  Feel free to bring your babushka, as long as she doesn't mind walking up the incline, the mountain, and then the narrow steep steps to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Coming off the Monangahela Incline in Pittsburg, a chance walk up the hill on Mount Washington will get the erstwhile traveler to this rather small & non-descript restaurant. For the uninitiated, you will have to know what you are looking for, or will miss it. Maybe it has a dedicated clientele too. It is easy to walk right past unless you are looking for the sign. This appears to be a home converted into a restaurant. The sitting room is up the stairs of a steep climb, so, if you have knees that don't agree with the climb, then you may not be able to get to the dining room. If there is a downstairs room, I did not see it. Thankfully, GrubHub delivers within 4 miles of the restaurant, so, if you are downtown, you can still access the cuisine.   Sparsely decorated, the main attraction is the food, and, if you are in the mood, a chat with the wait staff. The wait staff of 2, is dominated by Kair. He is ebullient, I believe well educated, well-travelled, and fun, should you engage him in conversation.   The food is good. I tried 3 items - the bread, the Uzbek Plov with beef, & the beef Samsa. I found that the bread desperately needed something to dip into, or mop up. That was interesting that no one gave me that suggestion, & unlike a general middle-eastern, or, Indian cuisine it had no particular dip suggestion on the menu. But it was still good on its own merit. The Plov is apparently a signature Rice dish from Uzbekistan. I found the quantity less than what I anticipated for traditional Biryani-type of dishes in Indian or Rice-dishes in Middle-eastern restaurants. Also, it is more oily than Biryani or Middle-eastern rice dishes, but, that is not a demerit, just a notification based on your preferences. The Samsa is a take on the Indian Samosa with its own twist. It is really a Puff-pastry, unlike a samosa, filled with, (choice of) Beef, or, Veggies. It is downright delicious.   The restaurant does not serve ETOH (that is alcohol my friends). It is a Halal restaurant, (if it matters to you - so, no pork dishes either). Restrooms are so-so utilitarian, and could use some attention. In summary, based on the 3 items that I tried, I found it a nice break from the standard grills, or the other commoner ethnic cuisines, and a nice break from monotony. I will surely be back when visiting the area. The menu is available online at: http://www.kavsar.net/menu/. Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"We were glad to find Kavsar and to get to try Uzbek food for the first time! :) The restaurant is slightly hidden as it is up the top of the hill of Shiloh St and a couple of blocks away from other restaurants/cafes down the hills with higher foot traffic. From the outside, it looks like a normal home and there's a slightly weird setup where you have to walk up the stairs upon entering the restaurant to get to the main dining area. The restaurant itself is not upscale by any means, but instead, has a homey feel to it. Meaning, it feels as if it's not as a professional restaurant (although I'm sure they are licensed! :D)...but rather more like you are dining at another person's home.  We tried the Uzbek yoghurt drink on a hot summer day (it's not too overly sweet and has a slight salt taste to it. You should try it for once!). For lunch, we tried a mix of pumpkin and beef Manti dumplings (their menu said to pick beef, pumpkin or spinach, but we asked them if we could mix the dumpling fillings, and they were happy to accommodate our request!), Kavsar Beef (delicious!...I also loved their slightly pickled fresh carrots that came on the side, too. Very refreshing!) and eggplant rolls. The addition of the fresh dills to the fries and other dishes makes the dish tastier..and is definitely a much better alternative to salt that we typically see in American food! :D  Overall, we found the dish very tasty and not too heavy. We ordered quite a bit of food, but surprisingly, after eating, we didn't feel like the meal was too heavy or too bloated like you'd feel bad eating when dining out and gorging yourself with too much food at all.  Overall, a great place for people to adventure our to try new food out of their comfort zone! We love our experiences and their prices were very reasonable. Service was slightly slow (and therefore -1) but I suspect that was because the dining room is upstairs, so at times, the waiter/waitress was elsewhere downstairs at the kitchen/on the first floor getting the food/drinks ready for the tables upstairs."}
{"text":"The Samsa was delicious. We enjoyed the pickled carrot salad very much.   The Beef Kavsar was essentially a pot roast (which was good). We were just expecting something totally out of the ordinary.  There was only one person waiting on the entire restaurant so it was hard for her to keep up with taking orders, delivering food and bussing tables.   The restaurant and bathroom could be kept cleaner...  We will give it another shot but hopefully things, service wise, are a little different next time."}
{"text":"We had a group of 4, so we had a chance to try a lot of dishes.  The Kasvar salad was very good. It could really be a main dish. You can smell the bread baking as you come in the door. The four of us had 2 large breads and we could not finish them ($3 for each large bread, definitely worth it).  We tried the spring leaves (lettuce wraps) which were great.  The Julian with pancake is a crepe filled with mushrooms. You can add beef or chicken. The sauce is delicious. I noticed one comment that the mushrooms are canned but they are still flavorful. I had the borsch which was delicious. My husband had the mushroom soup. Which he said was as good as the soup his Ukrainian grandmother made.  One person remarked how nice and quiet it was. We were in the small room on the first floor."}
{"text":"Undiscovered gem no longer. I'm here to say Kavsar is unique, affordable, and very satisfying.   There's a warm, old-fashioned, hospitality here that is very refreshing. I arrived for the Russian dishes by was quickly swayed in favor of the Uzbek options.   First off, don't pass on the traditional Uzbek bread. The small is quite large for one person. It's fresh baked bread, and comes in a round shape symbolic of the sun. It suggests supreme spirituality, compassion, generosity, hospitality and beauty. That's a lot for bread to live up to, however this bread succeeds.   Try the soups, they are important in this culture, and I'm fairly certain you will come to appreciate them, too.   This is a cozy, unique place. Make sure you give it a try."}
{"text":"Samsa-excellent Bread-excellent Shurpa soup-tasteless, with half a potato, 2 big pieces of meat, one huge slice of carrot and some green onions Borsch-OK, nothing special, I believe the beans they use are canned  Kovurma-good, not a whole lot of filling though Soup is very expensive, it was $8 for about 10-12 oz of clear soup in the Shurpa case. Definitely not something I would order again.  If you dont like dill, make sure you ask them to hold it b/c it comes on literally everything except the Samsa and bread."}
{"text":"Gotta try it!! I hate being so vague but from what I had to what others we sat to had to say, Everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"I can remember my curiosity when this charming Uzbek place had just opened up on Mt. Washington. I lived a 2 minute walk from the location. It seemed almost strange having something more culturally varied than Chinese or Italian Food up in a neighborhood where people have lived for generations and stuck to Club Sandwiches, Chicken Wings and other classic Diner Fare for the longest... but as a friend sat raving about it, I got excited. I LIKE variety! I was eager to try it out! I actually had to look back through my reviews because I couldn't believe I haven't written a review sooner! What started as a very small, traditional Uzbek (similar to Russian) menu has evolved into a large menu offering both the classic Uzbek menu items as well as sandwiches and Pizza! I remember they make the noodles in house, so I'm banking they make pizza dough fresh too. We recently tried the Eggplant Pizza, with fried eggplant, whipped eggs, onions, tomatoes, peppers and provolone & mozzarella. I like to joke that every time I find an eggplant pizza, the place removes it from their menu. I LOVE eggplant, just love it. The vanishing pizza thing has happened twice. I'm praying it doesn't with Kavsar, because this is by and far my favorite Pizza I've had in Pittsburgh! And that's saying something! The crust was just Sooooo fresh, and the cheese was delectable, and the Eggplant! Ahhhhh... That being said, definitely check out the traditional dishes. The Eggplant Roll and Spicy Pumpkin Samsa are TO DIE FOR. If there's one thing that rivals my love of Eggplant, it's my love of Pumpkin! Oh, and the unexpected champion of the menu? The Carrot Salad! Seriously... I don't even care much for carrots, but this is just amazing. The sauce it's in and the cut of the carrots just make this straight-forward dish so good! I remember right after the place had opened up, and the very intelligent student who had come over from Uzbekistan who waited on me had a very lengthy conversation with me about how, in that part of the world, people don't order much of the vegetarian stuff. As she put it \"That's more for you guys. We like our meat.\" That being said, maybe try out the traditional Lagman or Uzbek Plov. The Lagman I can vouch for: It's fantastic! I've tried it with beef.  No matter what you try, it's bound to be delicious!"}
{"text":"If ever there was an ethnic restaurant, Kavsar is it. It's tucked into the second floor of a home, as if you had just dropped in for dinner at your Uzbekistani neighbor's house. The whole dining area has a tidy, simplistic charm.  The one thing that threw me off after sitting down was the flat screen TV on a wall, from which Eurasian pop stars danced and beckoned flirtatiously, their disembodied voices pumping over the speakers. The lively beats were completely at odds with the calm crowd of diners and the timid waitress, but it kinda feels right. A bathroom was squished into the corner facing the second floor landing.   We started off with a pot of green tea in big, cylindrical cups that was gone in a few sips. Unfortunately refills are not free, and one pot is not enough to last four people more than a cup each.   For starters, we chose some Mushroom and Mashed Potato Pancakes and Beef Julien in Pancake Bags. The pancakes are slightly thicker than crepes and complement the savory fillings wonderfully. The Mashed Potato Pancakes are creamier (owing to the sour cream) and heavier, while the Julien delivered well-rounded bites of tender beef. We couldn't decide which one we liked better, so I guess you'll just have to get both. ;)   I've always loved a good, hearty soup, so I tried the Shurpa and another friend got the Borsch w/ Beans. These are medium-sized bowls, but the broth turned out to be thinner than we expected and the pork ridiculously tough. As if it were kept simmering in the pot for hours and hours. My Shurpa turned out to be just an average vegetable soup with a hunk of pork and judicious use of fennel, and my friend wasn't wowed with the Borsch either.   The other members of our party took the well-traveled and wiser path of ordering entrees: one Kavsar and one Brizol. I couldn't even tell you what was in these dishes except that it was the work of a kitchen god or goddess. Comfort food presented on a plate almost too genteel for its contents. And all halal!   The whole time we were there, we couldn't help but creep on the spread on our neighbor's tables - everything just looked so damn good. Reflecting back, I might actually like Kavsar better if they had a more down-to-earth feel. We forked over quite a bit of $$ for the meal and spared no morsel, and a return trip may be necessary if just to partake in this unique cuisine again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this spot on a walk while visiting Pittsburgh. We were the only patrons during lunch hour on a weekend, which felt slightly awkward. But the food and prices were good. The portions are large. I don't think Uzbek goes near the top of my ethnic-food loves, but I appreciated the wholesome-halal attitude surrounding it."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  The layout of the resturant feels dated, a bit like a suburban mom decorating a sitting room in the late 90's, but the staff was super helpful and the decor sorted of added to the charm.  A man played music in the corner, most of which was covers with some Uzbek songs as well, as a TV played Uzbek and Russian MTV.  I had the egg plant rolls and Kavsar, both of which I would recommend. I have nothing else to really compare the dishes to directly since this was my first encounter with Uzbek food, but the food was fresh and tasty.  I am excited to try more off the menu.  Oh, and the for the vegetarians, there was a decent vegetarian section."}
{"text":"This is a really good and authentic place. A lovely restaurant on Mt. Washington. Authentic Uzbek and Russian food, very reasonable prices, and excellent service. Also there is a dedicated parking lot down Southern Ave.   They have a lunch special at $9 that is a nice 2-course meal + tea."}
{"text":"Delicious food - new to Uzbek cuisine so tried several things - loved them all.  The spinach manti were excellent - served with a light spiced sauce.  My son had the \"cutlet\" which was more like a meatball - very tender.  Must go back!"}
{"text":"Uzbek food isn't something you encounter every day in the Rust Belt, so when you find a restaurant that specializes in it, you've got to give it a try!  My girlfriend and I stopped by Kavsar on a recent weekend trip to Pittsburgh, and we were both very pleased that we did.  This seems to be a small family-run operation, and when we arrived, the first-story café-style seating area was being renovated, so we were shown to a table upstairs in a more formal dining area.  The decor is odd and traditional, with paintings on what appeared to be animal skins and dyed textiles covering the walls.  I got quite a kick out of the \"entertainment\" - a TV screen showing a slideshow of facts about Uzbekistan (did you know that Uzbekistan is a major producer of uranium?  I did not!), accompanied by spooky Central Asian cover versions of 70's soundtrack tunes like \"Theme from The Godfather.\"  Kavsar's menu is quite large, and it was hard to decide where to start, as it features both traditional Uzbek dishes along with many Russian dishes that became popular in the Soviet era.  We ended up getting an order of homemade bread known as \"non,\" which was absolutely delicious.  Despite the name, it doesn't really resemble Indian naan, and it's somewhere between Greek-style pita and French bread - it's thick and doughy but also very fluffy in texture, and the sesame seeds on top were a nice touch.  We also sampled the eggplant rolls, which were simple but very tasty - cold strips of lightly fried eggplant wrapped around tomatoes and onions.  As for the entrées, I decided to stick to the Uzbek fare and selected the \"nuhot shurak,\" a dish of beef broth with chick peas, onions sautéed in vinegar and various seasonings, and braised shredded beef on top.  I also suspect there was a bit of tripe in the broth, though this was not specified on the menu, and the beef came with all the fatty bits still attached, which I enjoyed, though I imagine that the typical American diner would not be so receptive.  Curiously, the dish reminded me more of Mexican menudo than anything else, and though the beef was a bit dry, I would certainly try it again.  My girlfriend tried the Russian crab salad, which I later learned is still a very popular dish in Russia.  Seafood salads aren't really my thing, but she was still talking about it for days afterward!  All in all, Kavsar offers a pretty one-of-a-kind dining experience, and if I lived in the area, I would come back all the time for the bread alone."}
{"text":"Came in because of high reviews. Super disappointed. Drab atmosphere with horrible pop music playing the whole time. Got the mushroom and potato pancake things and eggplant rolls. Both looked wayyyy better than they tasted - bland and squishy when I wish they would've been crunchy and flavorful. Our appetizers were better but still no reason to come back. My mom got a noodle bowl that she liked and my brother got rice with beef that he also enjoyed. I wasn't a fan of my pumpkin dumplings. Also squishy and bland. My other brother got chicken kebabs that appeared like they'd be spicy but we're lukewarm and also bland. Bland bland bland, common theme. Slow service. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced with small portion sizes. The food tasted okay but definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"We got the twin pancakes as a starter and then I moved into the mushroom soup which was delicious my wife at the traditional how long of an I had the stroganoff we will be coming here again it's on our way to becoming a favorite Mount Washington restaurant."}
{"text":"I recently went to Kavsar for lunch with a colleague.  Was intrigued and wanted to try Uzbekistani/Russian cuisine.  We were there for a little over an hour and were literally the only customers in the restaurant the entire time.  That aside, our waitress was very sweet and helpful and the food was very good.  I had carrot salad, pumpkin dumplings and a side of bread.  The carrot salad was the best part of the meal.  It's a must-try, very garlicky (which is not a problem for me).  The dumplings were terrific; although, we had to wait 25 minutes (which was fine for me).  The bread was delicious and very bagel-like.  My colleague had the carrot salad (and agreed that it was the best part of the meal), as well as kebabs.  We were also seated in front of a mounted flat screen TV that played Uzbek music videos, which was entertaining and gave a glimpse into a different culture.  As for a return trip, I am sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was alright. Our food was warmed up, not cooked fresh. It looked like food was prepared few days ago     ( I know this because of following reasons: Taste - it literally tasted like warmed food, people do notice when they served warmed and few days old food. Look - You get that overly cooked onion in Somsa and other dishes that includes Onion when that food is warmed up several times.) and taste was ok, not what I expected for a restaurant. Keep in mind your bill includes the 15% tip."}
{"text":"So rare to find an Uzbek restaurant! The portions were ample, the menu was extensive, and the service was good (less hovering than at many \"American\" places). I like Uzbek cuisine, with one small exception: there are more raw onions than I prefer. Overall, our meat was tender, our tea was warm, and we left stuffed."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. the Kavsar was really tasty, a bit like meat loaf."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the little lanes of Mt Washington is this gem of a place that pops up almost out of nowhere in the heart of a homely neighborhood. Where do I start.. Ok.. so they have a separate vegetarian menu..that's one star right there! The dishes are a nice balance of truly authentic with a couple of fusion options thrown in like Pasta or Eurasian stroganoff. We started with the mushroom and potato Samsa, eggplant rolls and stuffed tomatoes. I would have given the place 5 stars right there! But we didn't stop there did we. My boyfriend and I proceeded to order the traditional Uzbek bread and the mushroom soup, because soups are apparently important in the Uzbek culinary experience. Both were fantastic, fresh and warmly soothing on a cold winter evening. And then we also tried the Manti, the stuffed dumplings. We couldn't decide if we wanted the pumpkin ones or the spinach ones and our waitress sweetly suggested bringing us a half plate one type and the other half of the other. Problem solved! I'd actually give them a couple of extra stars for the service if I could! Our waitress was so helpful, accommodative and efficient. The one item I wish they had on heir menu was vegetarian plaf! (A traditional uzbek rice dish). But our waitress told us that all we had to do is to call ahead next time and they'd have it made! The overall experience was like dining in a warm, friendly Uzbek home! (With interesting interiors!) Here's a business that values its patrons and they've found a huge fan in me. Of course, I took some baklava home for a late night snack. Both my heart and tummy slept happy and satisfied last night!"}
{"text":"Come hungry- very hungry! Excellent soup and dumplings and crepes and mmmm! Fun authentic atmosphere. And one of the owners is a cellist in the Pittsburgh symphony!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Me and my husband were there last night. The place was empty we were the only ones there. We ordered the pancake bags for appetizer absolutely YUM! then I ordered the sausage dish called kavsar and my husband ordered the chicken gampan both were delish! This place is worth your money!"}
{"text":"We were on a road trip and passing through Pittsburgh and came here for a late dinner. The food was amazing and the place has a very home-y feel. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The short version: Would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a unique culinary experience that you can't find everywhere. Delicious food at reasonable prices.  The long version: Took my boyfriend here for lunch today and we LOVED this place. A few reasons why I really enjoyed my experience:  (1) First and foremost, the food was *delicious* and fresh. We ordered:  - A traditional Uzbek bread (shaped like a disk with a thick rim and an indented middle, sprinkled with sesame seeds). This was served piping hot and fresh.  - A spiced pumpkin + onion samsa (an Uzbek-style samosa). Made to order and very fresh. Amazing balance of flavors. My mouth is watering as I type. - A beef julien (a crepe folded around a creamy beef and mushroom filling to make a pouch shape). - Plov (traditional Uzbek rice) - Beef manti (steamed dumplings served with sour cream). Kind of similar to Chinese soup dumplings. Succulent packages of meat and juice that explode with flavor on every bite. - Ayran (a chilled yogurt drink)  The yogurt drink is probably a bit of an acquired taste (I'm sure it's quite refreshing once you get used to its strong sourness), but we really loved everything else from the first bite. To me, the highlights were definitely the bread (SO soft and airy), the pumpkin samsa, and the manti. Get at least those 3 things when you come here.  (2) The pricing was very reasonable. Even with all that food we ordered (which ended up being too much for the two of us), the price came out to just $37 before tip.  (3) It was just so much fun to experience a new culture. Due to the country's geography and history, Uzbek food features elements from many other cuisines that you may already be familiar with: Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern, Eastern European, and possibly more. It was very cool to see all these flavors come together into something I had never tasted before.  (4) The service was outstanding. Our waiter was so polite and courteous that it really stood out because it's uncommon to see servers being so formal.  My one criticism is that the interior could really use a facelift. While the Uzbekistan-themed art and tapestries are nice, the building is very clearly just a house that got converted to a restaurant, and it seems like it's been a while since it's been renovated. It doesn't have much of an atmosphere. It didn't help that the TV on the wall was randomly playing Keane music videos that didn't go very well with the decor.  Still, I can't wait to come back again! My stomach is already craving more manti..."}
{"text":"Nice dining room and waiting stuff. Food was below average and overpriced. Only julien in pancake could receive a grade B. the rest was just bland and tasteless. Bread (claimed homemade) was not even baked well. Till they get a new good chef we are not going back."}
{"text":"On our wait to Pittsburgh for family weekend we wanted to try some new types of food. So we found Kavsar on apple maps and we went there for dinner. The soups were excellent, the service was great, but the only problem was the location. It was located in a small building with most of the dinning on the second floor."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Very cozy and romantic atmosphere.    We asked lots of questions about the menu and all were answered with kindness and patience.  The bread was homemade and served fresh and hot. The marinated vegetables were also homemade and yummy.   We asked our server for suggestions and we enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered.   The pumpkin samsa was terrific, the okroshka soup very tasty and the kovurma chuchvara with dill sauce delicious.  The baklava was the perfect finish to our meal.   Be sure to get the traditional green tea with you meal.   Everyone was so friendly and willing to teach us about their culture.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I find that the places with the best food are often the least expected. My family and I decided to try out this place after searching for nearby restaurants in Pittsburgh.   While the roads leading up to the restaurant were hilly and slightly difficult to navigate, we found our way eventually. The restaurant doesn't seem like much outside-- if anything, it looks like any other house in the area. The interior is very homely with the dining area upstairs. There weren't many people, which we liked-- it allowed for peaceful eating and light conversation without loud noises in the way.  The waitress was attentive and extremely nice, even helping us with directions after we finished. We got quite a bit for four people-- 1 large bread, 2 soups, 4 kebabs, eggplant rolls, and 2 main entrees. We ended up with lots of leftovers, even after stuffing ourselves full with the amazing food.   The bread is really fresh, warm, and soft. Even though there wasn't any sauces to dip them in, the bread itself is good enough to eat alone. I had some dipped in soup, and it's great either way. Probably the best bread I've ever had. The kebabs are essentially meat, but they were cooked pretty well and were tasty. We only got around to eating one entree, the Kavsar, out of the two we ordered, since we were so full. The balance of egg, cheese, and meat is amazing, and is definitely something to try here.  Overall, the food here is amazing. Despite its less than beautiful exterior, this restaurant is one you should try out in Pittsburgh, with great food, staff, and a nice, quiet environment."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood restaurant.  My husband and I have been wanting to try this place and finally made it over there last night. The upstairs is very nicely decorated and the wait staff were very smiley and sweet. We tried some different dishes.  It appeared to be very meat heavy, but they so have a little vegetarian section on the back.  I ordered some noodles with a great red sauce And veggies.  It looked like it was going to be spicy but was not.  My meal had a great flavor.  They best part was dessert.  We ordered baklava.  We tried to order two pieces, but I think the waitress misunderstood bc she brought us two plates with 4 pieces each.  ( you would think we would have corrected her but no. It was so good we ate it all!!!). So we went home very stuff with dinner and lots of sweet, nutty dessert!!!  Would definitely recommend trying it to eat something different and def get the dessert!!   They do have live music too.  Nice way to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"With the lush beet-red drapes and art covering all the walls and the simple but pristinely set matching tables, it's like stepping into a homey little Uzbek world decorated by your babushka.  Though the atmosphere is rustic, the service is impeccable.  During our hour and a half dinner there on a Thursday night, our table of 2 and 2 other duos were attended to by a single, excruciatingly polite server who checked on us often and addressed us by our names.  It was the kind of service I'd expect from a personal butler if I were a very fancy person--super different from the divey Asian places I'm used to where they almost ignore you and practically treat you like an inconvenience.  We opted for a small portion of the HOMEMADE BREAD, the SHURPA SOUP, BEEF LAGMAN, and  MANTI platter with half beef, half spinach.  By the way, it's awesome that they let you mix and match!  The crusty, sesame seed bread is a must if you're ordering anything soupy, which isn't hard with the menu selections.  The SHURPA soup was very simple, with 2 large chunks each of beef, potato, and carrot, and very clean but dilly-tasting broth.  I'm a huge fan of dill and of beef broth, so this hit the spot.  The level of flavor packed into the clear broth was fantastic and clearly not a quick-fix feat.  The lagman was a very homestyle dish, with nice thick noodles piled with chopped beef and veggies (onions, celery, red and green peppers) and sprinkled generously with dill, although the herbs definitely didn't overpower the dish.  I loved the flavors, and the broth was a bit oily but rich, clinging to the noodles and veg and making every bite delicious.  I'd like that sauce reduced to put on everything, please.  But I have to say, as a biased dumpling lover, the manti were my favorite.  The beef ones were tender, and the spinach ones, which I slightly preferred, were very herbal and fragrant.  They came with a ranch-like dipping sauce.  The wrappers weren't handmade but you can't have it all.  Just don't do what I did and tip the manti upside down--you'll lose the broth inside, and it's sad.  The dishes and flavors at Kavsar are such a unique mix of Eastern European and Central Asian and worth a try on that account alone.  Park in the Kavsar-reserved lot across the street and prepare to be well-taken care of.  Our server insisted on packing up our leftovers with the bread in a separate paper bag to keep it fresh.  If he's ever looking for a new job away from the restaurant scene, I think we could work something out."}
{"text":"Splendid! I especially enjoyed the carrot salad, stuffed eggs, and beef dumplings. Most entrees are under $12. Our waitress Lili was extremely friendly and attentive. Beautiful Uzbeki tapestries on the wall. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kavsar serves Uzbek and Russian foods. I had never eaten Uzbek food, but I grew up eating Russian foods because of my two Russian grandparents. Tonight to celebrate Russian Christmas Eve, I decided to give this restaurant a try. I was worried about not having a reservation, but when my husband and I showed up, only one other table was occupied. We chose a table ourselves upstairs. I noticed that some lights in the room were out, although the room was still well-lit, and some tables had dirty tablecloths. There was a large TV on the wall that played music and videos. The waitress soon introduced herself and handed us the menus. Throughout the service, she was nice, offered drink refills, and brought out our food on time. I really enjoyed the taste of my samsa (a large crispy pastry with ground beef inside), borsch (cabbage, beef, beans, and potato in beet broth), and vareniki (eight pierogies filled with potato). My husband, who is not of Russian or Uzbek ancestry, ordered only one dish (I think the gampan, which is rice with vegetables and beef or chicken). I liked my food better than his. The total bill was only about $32 plus tip. I will have to talk my husband into bringing me back here in the future so I can try more dishes. I encourage other people to give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"If this place just made Bread it would be 5 stars all day. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best bread that I have ever had. No question. However, the rest of the dishes that I've had here were somewhat average, with the exception of the Dumplings which are also very good. The borscht, Lagman, and Stroganoff weren't anything special, and my girlfriend said her mushroom soup was gross. I am going to continue going here until I find an entree that I really like, only because the bread is Sooooooo good. I recommend going here, but only if you're a proponent of top notch Carbohydrates."}
{"text":"Oh my! Loved it! Saw it driving by one weekend, enjoying the view over the city and strolling around up there, next change I was with a hungry group we went there. Fantastic! It's (to me) an interesting mix of the known and unknown mixed, a little bit like Turkish cooking but more silk road.... and it feels like you visited your darling relatives in Uzbekistan for the first time and the whole family is stumbling over you to make you feel as conformable as possible and pampering you left and right. I mean, who would not love that? We had a a wonderful large salad, soup with chicken dumplings, rice with beef and veggies and beef with chickpeas and pasta. Apparently everything is made from scratch and it seems like no dish contains less than at least 20 ingredients (but I didn't count nor ask the cook, only an assumption). It turns out they substitute mutton with beef as the US mutton doesn't taste authentic.  Don't forget to taste the salty yogurt drink ayran, refreshing and delicious.  Decor is matching with the food style and the waitress we had was probably the nicest person I met in the last five years altogether.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We didn't entirely know what to expect out of Kavsar Restaurant. But the second I saw that there was an Uzbek restaurant in Pittsburgh, I knew we had to try it. This isn't something you can get just anywhere, folks. It's unique. And it's DELICIOUS. The food at Kavsar is 5 stars, hands down, no debate about it.   Kavsar is definitely not a restaurant one would have found in the days before GPS and Yelp. It's off the beaten path in a residential neighborhood, far from the hub of activity in the city. To get there, we drove up and down crazy streets with massive inclines and sharp turns, through some areas of the city we never would have seen otherwise. Kavsar is located in a small, old building on the corner of a dimly lit residential street on Washington Mountain. There is a private parking lot for it on the opposite side of the street a block away. (They ask you on a sign there to remember your license plate number and register it in the restaurant, so that non-patrons do not use the lot, but the waitress told us we didn't really need to give it to her.) The restaurant smells really good. We were led up their small staircase up into the upstairs dining room. It all seemed a little sketchy at first, but once you get up there, it's a very nice atmosphere.  It was a real toss-up of what to order here. It all looks so good. I had the ugra, a soup of beef, noodles, potatoes, carrots, dill, green onions, and some other spices. It is a traditional Uzbek soup and it was absolutely delicious. The noodles and potatoes were perfectly cooked and you could tell everything had been slow-cooked carefully with just the right amount of each spice. I highly recommend the ugra.  My mom had the nuhot shurak, a delicious dish of beef, onions (pickled?), and chickpeas swimming in savory beef broth and a spice mix. It was heavenly. The beef in the nuhot shurak was the best thing we tasted here. The chickpeas were perfectly cooked and absorbed the flavor of the broth well.  My dad had the plov (also spelled palov), which is Uzbekistan's essential rice dish, with a little beef, carrots, and green onions mixed in, and a whole lot of spices. The plov spices were definitely very unique. You can tell this place cares about getting everything just right, because they used different spices in all of our dishes. They don't take shortcuts here. They make stuff just how it is intended to be made.   There's little more a restaurant can do to be perfect. If you're in Pittsburgh this is a must!!! Where else can you get an authentic Uzbek meal?? I want to try it all...the lagman, the gampan, the kovurma chuchvara, the shurpa, the mastava, the okroshka...I have no doubt that it would all be delicious. And on top of everything, it's pretty cheap too! Our meal for three was under $30 excluding tip!"}
{"text":"This time around we tried some different items, namely a rice dish, a noodle dish, and dumplings. The chuchvara dumplings were pretty cute and small, but one plate came with 16 of them so there was plenty to share. The dumpling skins weren't too thick and the stuffing was tasty with a bit of soup inside. Definitely not as substantial as say Chinese pork soup dumplings, but very satisfying nonetheless.   The lagman and gampan both came with a very similar sauce and were seasoned with many of the same herbs and spices (dill on top was the most visually obvious). They also shared a lot of the same cut vegetables. The main difference was that the rice was much drier since it was not mixed with the meat and veggies, while the noodles came underneath the bottom layer of sauce. Both were superb. The rice paired well with the broth, while the lagman was not too overwhelming despite the noodles already sitting in the sauce. All are things I would get again."}
{"text":"We came to this place unexpectedly and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it . Food was very fresh and unbelievable tasty , the atmosphere was very comfy. The Uzbek singer has great voice ( my boyfriend did not like when that guy singed  something romantic and constantly looked at me ) Anyways , great place and on our next visit to Pittsburg we will go there again with pleasure."}
{"text":"What a fun place! First of all, they have a whole vegetarian menu! That is simply music to my ears. Amazing. I do want to point out to my fellow vegetarian eaters that there were a few items (and good ones at that) that were vegetarian but not on the strictly vegetarian menu. The cheese pancakes and bread are some examples.  I am lucky enough to be familiar with many of these dishes, so I did not hesitate to try a few things. They are definitely authentic tasting and worth the awkward parking. For my main, I got the handmade Vareniki. Basically think of dumpling-like pierogies filled with just potato and onion. Served with sour cream in the middle and dill on top. I loved them! Like I said before, authentic and simple. The cheese pancakes and bread (also mentioned before) were very good as well. The cheese was sweet and the pancake was like a crepe. For dessert, I tried the napoleon cake. It reminded me a bit of the cake made of wafers and condensed milk but it was softer and a bit creamier. I loved it! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying uzbek/russian food. Everything i ordered was so delicious. Service is excellent. Ambience is cool. Must visit halal restaurant in the hill district of pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Servers take the time to greet you and help you with recommendations on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem. Even though this is the only place where I've had Uzbek food, the homey feel combined with the unique flavors, add a touch of authenticity to this place. The Kavsar is great, especially when gulped down with a glass of Ayran. The \"appetizer\" pancakes are more desserts than apps, but are great as well."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this place recently and I loved it!   We started with the eggplant rolls and the stuffed eggs. I hate all eggplant dishes, or so I thought, and then I ate the eggplant roll. It is a dish served chilled and I loved it. The stuffed eggs have fish in them and were also good.  The bread was amazing.   I tried the Chuchvara and my friends had the Lagman and Kavsar. Of course, we all tried each dish and we all really liked the food.   The service was good but she had to lug everything up and down stairs, I think. She earned her tip!   The only negative I will add is the decor. Banquet-type chairs covered in white cloth with a black band were odd. Also, I hate pink and there are pink walls. Can't make everyone happy all the time. The videos on the television, presumably Uzbek music videos, were entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"Touted as Pittsburgh's first Uzbekistanian restaurant, we went and I had no idea what to expect. The food was very reminiscent of Greek food. Kabobs were plentiful, meat dumplings, even Baklava for dessert. They do in fact have a vegetarian menu, small items, salads, and entrees.   The carrot salad is what I started out with, sweet and spicy, one of my favorite taste combinations. A touch of garlic played nicely against the oil and vinegar dressing. I choose the eggplant roll as an Appetizer. Rolled eggplant stuffed with garlic and tomatoes, the dill was an excellent touch to finish off this dish. Lagman was my main course, homemade noodles covered in vegetables and spices. I could have had sliced beef or chicken over it but i went vegan. Delicious, a very rich broth brought all the ingredients together into a hearty meal. Almost like a Russian Pho! Green tea was the beverage we enjoyed with this meal. Just a little warning, they don't serve alcohol, I'm not sure if they allow you to bring wine. Small dining area, you may want to call before arriving. We were too full to even think about dessert, we noticed a dessert of the day on the menu, but didn't ask what it was.   I'm defiantly making this one of my go to places. Who would have thought a Russian Restaurant on Mt Washington? The menu is extensive, lots of beef items. And Gino Malkin of the Penguins is a regular."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a group of 6.  Our lunch lasted over 1.5 hrs, and the place was not busy.  So it is not a quick in and out place, but the food was worth it, if you are not in a rush.   We had the eggplant roll, julien in pancake bags, and manti as appetizers.  All were delicious.  I had the lagman as an entree and it was perfect home style cooking, warming me up on a cold December day.  Equally happy were the others, with the Uzbec palov and various kebabs.  The service was very friendly, definitely will come back here in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night with my fiance and 2 other dining companions for a late dinner.   My fiance and I arrived right around 8:30 PM to a completely empty restaurant.  The downstairs of the restaurant is a bar area with a couple of tables that can only seat three people.  As I looked around a little worried about the seating situation, our server came out and asked how many?  Whenever we replied with 4 she pointed to some stairs and said that we could sit upstairs.  Since she didn't come with us we were free to seat ourselves wherever we wanted.  The upstairs of this place is actually quite nice and reminded me of a room used to host nice parties.  There were white table clothes on all of the tables along with white chair covers and black bows.  The only oddity was the flat screen TV on one of the walls which had on a foreign station (Uzbecki perhaps?) playing music videos.  While it seemed a bit odd at first, everyone eventually ended up enjoying the music.  Since none of us had ever had Uzbek halal before the table decided to split a couple of appetizers to start off with.  We went with the eggplant roll, julien in pancake bags and finally a double order of the homemade bread.  Both the eggplant roll and julien in pancake bags come out together before our meals.  We were actually debating about whether we should order the pancake bags or something else whenever we had placed our order but after it arrived we were more than happy to have to stuck with our decision since it was delicious.  It did indeed look like a pancake bag whenever it arrived at our table and seemed to have the consistency of Injera.  The inside of the bag was filled with mushroom, beef and a creamy sauce all of which was delicious.  Meanwhile the eggplant roll consisted of some eggplant rolled up around tomato and garlic with dill on it.  It was decent but paled in comparison to the bags.  For my entree I went with the Kavsar (You can't go wrong ordering a restaurants namesake, right?) while my fiance went with the Gampam and our dining companions went with Chuchvara and Lagman with each couple also ordering a lamb kabob.  It was nice to see all of the different dishes whenever they arrived at the table with the double order of homemade bread.  The kavsar is roasted meat sausage rolled with whipped eggs and cheese steamed with some bell peppers and I choose mashed potatoes as my side.  It ended up having a pretty good flavor and it reminded me quite a bit of stuffed cabbage with the cheese and egg taking the place of the cabbage.  I was also able to taste both my fiances Gampam(rice topped with rich and delicious broth with vegetables, asian spices and beef tender loin) and our friends Chuchvara (handmade small boiled dumplings filled with ground beef and chopped onions) with the spices in the Gampam making it my favorite of the three entrees I tried.  The kabob was also excellent and sort of reminded me of peppered beef jerky.  That's not a bad thing in my book though as I do love that flavor.  The homemade bread was also really good with a unique shape and a good thick crust around it and a soft inner filling.  Finally for dessert my fiance and I ended up splitting the dessert of the day which was a honey cake.  The server was unable to describe it to us but being adventuous, we ordered it anyways.  I would describe it as a multi layered sponge cake with a strong taste of honey in the frosting and both my fiance and I thought that it tasted pretty good.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  The restaurant itself ended up looking pretty good inside, our server was nice and all of the food was had was both different and good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Had some sort of sausage, eggplant roll and soup dumplings. The environment is nice  Has free parking at the corner"}
{"text":"Went here for my husband birhtday, my choice. i was here before  The service was good and meals reasonably price I had Brizol its comes with rice or fries and salad, it was very ordinary and forgetable However my husband was a lot more impressed by his food. costumer service is perfect! free parking! nice place ! We will  definitely returning !"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on Saturday, really good service, cute small resturant. The food was amazing though. The eggplant rolls were so fresh tasting and the sosma  (not sure on the spelling) but get the spiced pumpkin you won't regret that.  The food was overall great and all homemade. Except the desserts. The baklava was store bought, I don't think they hid the fact that they bought it. The box was in the fridge right where you enter. That is the on reason why I am giving a 3 star review. If I am paying 3 something for store bought, I could have just bought it myself.   Make sure you mention in the beginning to spilt the bill."}
{"text":"Great home made food! Service was great, we had the steamed dumplings, handpulled noodles, and burka soup. Ended with the honey cake. All ingredients was very fresh! Would highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"Bread is fabulous, dumplings too! The Lagman was a nice hearty noodle dish. Kavsar is a great solution for when you want take-out but want to try something new. An awesome facet of the Shiloh Street shops!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of an Uzbek restaurant before, so I came here on a whim for lunch. I was the only person in the restaurant and was a little scared. I'm so happy I took a chance because it was excellent! I had eggplant rolls and lagman (noodles with vegetables and chicken in a broth). Both were so flavorful and fresh tasting. The server was super nice and helpful! Definitely worth the hike up the hill!"}
{"text":"Very nice Uzbekistan & Russian cuisine.  The place has just opened when me and my 3 friends went there. Manti (dumplings with meat) were the best, and home-made bread with fruit compote felt just like at home!  The place is very quiet, clean, with tablecloths on tables, which is seldom seen around Pitt. Staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing special. Weird sitting arrangement, no booze , and middle eastern dishes"}
{"text":"Words can not describe how good is food in this restaurant! If you want to try something new and delicious, Kavsar is best place for that!"}
{"text":"Food was made from scrach ,this is why there is awaiting period.We spend a good amount of money for dinner but it worth every penny. It was sad to see that some delicious dishes as traditional lamb meals were removed and pizza and hod dogs for american junk food lovers were added for this real gem to survive in business. For those who appreciate good food and not afraid to try something unusual and very authentic I would highly recommend this place. Keep up doing a great job,dinner at this place was THE best meal that we had during our 4 days trip."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place isn't packed from open to close. It's a gem. My husband and I went to dinner here a little after 6 on a Friday and we were the only two in the entire restaurant.   The space/decor is kinda like grandma's house if grandma had white table cloths. It's homey and dated in that charming grandma-y way. There was only one server working and she was helpful, taking the time to make suggestions and answer all of our questions.   The menu is extensive and I had a tough time deciding what to order. Everything sounded SO GOOD. We finally decided on cottage cheese pancakes, sherpa soup, meatball noodle soup, manti, and kavsar.   Everything was delicious. The soups were flavorful and the cottage cheese pancakes were awesome enough to have as a dessert course (even though we ate them first). I particularly loved the Manti and the Kavsar. The manti are steamed dumplings stuffed with meat. They were so flavorful and I could definitely tell they were hand-made and fresh. The Kavsar was the star of the night. It's described as a \"roasted meat sausage rolled with whipped eggs and cheese steamed with vegetables\". It was a party in my mouth. I found the texture to be more like a fluffy meatloaf. It was so good and everything comfort food needs to be.   We had a fantastic first experience with Uzbek cuisine. We'll definitely be back again with friends!"}
{"text":"My guests and I both enjoyed the Uzbek food served here."}
{"text":"An incredible little restaurant. Had the pumpkin manti (steamed dumplings) and kavsar (called a sausage on the menu, but more like a very well spiced meatloaf) plus a noodle dish, the name of which escapes me (it's described as a traditional Uzbek dish). All of them were delicious. We took the incline and walked along Grandview ave. I can't imagine a better way to do it."}
{"text":"A nice place to try something different. Have eaten here twice. Second time was quite busy compared to first and service was slow but understandably so. Found out it was waitresses first night and was the only waitress. Main dining area in upstairs and everything needs to be brought up a long flight of steep steps. There is a few tables on the ground floor if stairs are a problem. All in all worth a try though. Favorite dish was also named Kavsar."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant when I visited Pittsburg. My boyfriend and I wanted something different from American and Asian food so we decided to go to this restaurant. The food was surpringly good! We tried the Karvar salad, shurpa soup, kavsar entre, chicken & beef kebab, and ayran yogurt drink. I really liked the Kavar salad and entre as well as the kebabs. My boyfriend really liked the soup and yogurt drink. Overall, it was a good meal that we both really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this week with friends, I'm a veg., they're not.  We were all amazed at how delicious everything was.  We all agreed we'd go back and tell friends about it. Today I told people at work about it and persuaded a party of 7 to try it for dinner.  I loved the olive salad, the pumpkin filled \"perogies\" the main dish with noodles and the baklava was awesome!  GO THERE NOW BEFORE THE MASSES FIND IT."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went for a late night dinner at this Uzbek and Russian cuisine restaurant. They have a small downstairs dining area but a larger one upstairs. Place is BYOB. They also serve pizza here.  Kavsar specializes in fresh ingredients drawn from local farmer's markets and prepare them in house. Please note that the desserts aren't homemade. Our group was shown labeled boxes that they came in prior to ordering.  It goes without saying that you should invest in their homemade bread. There's enough to feed at least 4-5 people. It comes in a round which you can break off. Oh so good!!!  They also have a vegetarian menu but vegan options are available. Check carefully on this one and you will find a few things. Better yet ask your server.  We started off with sharing a couple of appetizers which eggplant rolls and sweet cottage cheese pancakes that resembled crepes. Both were delicious!!  I decided to go with one of the homemade soups. Russian borsch is on the menu but I opted for Mastava which was a Uzbek soup. This soup is a meal in itself that included beef, chickpeas, and rice in a traditional beef broth. The bread we had ordered made a perfect accompaniment. Someone in our group ordered Varenki which was a Russian version of periogies with a potato and onion filling. I got to sample a piece and it was so light!  Some of the others had different soups and my friend sitting next to me had beef and fried vegetables over rice. That too I got to sample and believe me it did not disappoint. Portion sizes are generous!  Our waiter both friendly and helpful as always offered us dessert. Although we were fairly stuffed we all split an order of Napoleon and baklava. The Napoleon had a sweet creamy center and the Baklava was indeed very good.   Reservations can be made on their website and catering is available. Parking can be a problem but there is a city metered lot a couple of blocks down.  This is a great hidden gem in Mt.Washington and my first chance to sample authentic Russian and Uzbek cuisine. Prices are very reasonable for what you get and makes a great place to go if you want to try a new cuisine. You can also order on grubhub. Will most certainly return to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday for lunch. The place was completely empty and only the waitress was to be seen. She spoke very little with us, but we have had Uzbek food several times before so we didn't have as many questions as first tries. We had beef Julian pancake bags for starter which was the weakest of the meal. There was very little flavor and mushrooms were canned. For entree we had plov and manti. Frankly the food was really not special but what makes it worse is that we distinctly had the impression that they were serving us badly because of us being the only customers. First there was no bread for starters which I saw on pictures of people who came for dinner. Then plov's meat was to the side and burnt. I have had plov several times before and can see that the one we were served here is not how it is supposed to be served. Plus Uzbeks always serve plov with a salad to cut the oily texture. No salad was served. Manti of beef and pumpkin was also disappointing.  If you don't want to make an effort to serve lunch then close shop at that time of the day."}
{"text":"Girls night sis and two nieces . We all tried something different and liked everything ,sorry all the names escape me . Please go and try it!  Very Inexpensive for the meal, we had two appetizers , 4,meals and Baklava split, enough for the four of us , total $63!"}
{"text":"LOVE Kavsar. Delicious food and very friendly staff. The atmosphere is quirky and fun. Definitely recommend if you're a foodie!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my family after taking the Monongahela incline up to Mt Washington. As we were looking at the menu outside, a neighbor stopped to tell us how good the food at Kavsar was, which convinced us to go in. She was definitely right!   We tried the carrot salad, homemade bread, eggplant rolls, manti dumplings, dumplings in soup, and the Kavsar. They were well seasoned, fresh and delicious! My favorite was the carrot salad - I could eat that every day. Service was great, though it may get slow if there are more parties dining at the same time.  I noticed they also deliver via Grubhub! Definitely recommend it to those lucky folks in the delivery area."}
{"text":"Had dinner there. Here's the breakdown:  Appetizer: samsa. Basically a samosa, only with beef and onion. Delicious. A+  Dinner item #1 kavsar beef. This got many mentions on here. The good news is that the smaller pieces of meat were tasty, and the rice with them was good too. The bad news is that the big pieces were very tough. C+  Dinner item #2 palov. Like a pot roast over fried rice--fairly straightforward, tasty but unremarkable. B  Dessert: Baklava. Terrific--not overly sweet, and a nice sized serving. A.  So, it's a bit of a mixed bag, the dinner entrees were a bit disappointing, but the appetizer and dessert were good enough for me to boost them up to four stars. Plus, having an Uzbek restaurant in town is nice."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was uninspired, bland, uninteresting.  They could have had some spicy kebabs on the menu.  I've eaten at several caucus / russian / central asian restaurants in the Philadelphia area, and they turned me on to this type of food.  This was not a good representation of this cuisine."}
