{"text":"I like this place. Good fresh sandwiches and reasonable prices. I just can't get past the service. Hire another employee to help. It's averaged 15 to 25 minutes each time I've been here just to get my sandwich."}
{"text":"Worst food in my life!!!! If you would even call it food.   Everything comes out of a super sized tub that's been sitting in their cooler for God knows how long. Guy that works there thinks he knows everything. Pretty sure he has never been to a real deli. Their sandwiches are creative as their logo, which looks like the first font found on Microsoft word.   The only thing homemade is the soup, which is probably the worst thing on the menu.   I cannot say enough about how awful this place is. Only go there if you enjoy the flavors dried up meat in between two pieces of sandpaper."}
{"text":"My sister and I were traveling through last week and my sister spotted Cannon's. She had the veggie and I had the Reuben. We split them and shared (always a good sign). We thought we'd had a good lunch AND then we tasted the Apple cheesecake. Out of this world. Turns out it was made by the proprietor's mother - a retired  Chemist. We live in Georgia or we'd be regulars!"}
{"text":"Awesome family-owned deli located in DTW.   Stocked with local ingredients. Daily specials on soup and sandwiches offer a variety to their menu and extra value to the customers."}
{"text":"We had excellent service ( and did not see them microwave any food while we were there) chili Mac and cheese we were very pleased with. I thought the Ruben could use more sauerkraut.   Nice change from the restaurants already on Erie street- but it is what it is which is a deli serving soups,sandwiches  etc not something with a more unique flare like morehouse or local sol."}
{"text":"witnessed this place microwaving their hot dogs and how can a deli call itself an NYC deli and they dont even make their own tuna or chicken salad. tubs everywhere and no home-made food. plus the owner has an attitude. was not impressed and wont be back again after witnessing this bargain deli."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and amazing soups! Very high quality food and you can't beat the value. Always  happy to support a family-owned local business!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. One dude making all sandwiches and he got mine wrong. They were very willing to correct the order and even gave us free soda because they messed up. Overall I really wanted this place to be awesome but it turns out it's really not any better than a subway. Price wise they were pretty good. My wife and I both got a sandwich a bag of chips and a pasta salad and a soda for 18 dollars.  They have a nice family deal for 20 dollars with 4 sandwiches. If you really really want a cold cut sandwich and you were in the area this place will fit your needs. Nothing exciting just plain and simple."}
{"text":"In my opinion, The Cannon Deli is a wonderful place to experience a meal. The customer service there is second to none. Their very fresh ingredients are hand cut right before you, all sandwiches and salads,prepared on the spot. A rotating variety of soups are available daily. Their fresh 1/4 # hotdogs are grilled on the spot, no heat lamps there. It has been my experience that you will never leave there hungry or broke. Very well priced and great portions. There are many places in the neighborhood but if you just need a soup, salad,deli sandwich, wrap or one pound baked potato, it would be foolish to go elseware. Again, this is my opinion on my MANY experiences there"}
