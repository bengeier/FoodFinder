{"text":"Old and cold. Owner offered to put my plate in the microwave. Not very clean. I'll stick with Jasmine Buffet"}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet. The staff is really nice and the food is on par for a buffet. Some of the food does seem Luke warm though."}
{"text":"Sushi and hibachi are very good. Buffet has everything you could ask for. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I liked this place as it was pretty clean and the servers were nice plus they greeted me with a smile. 

The food was decent, but it wasn't as hot as I hope but all and all this was a good experience for me.

The price was fair as well."}
{"text":"This was certainly an interesting place.

I was treated here so I don't actually know how much we paid to eat here, so I can only comment on the food and the service:

This place has does buffet/hibachi style stuff, with some sushi as well. The buffet has a huge plethora of options, and it's not all Chinese food. I would say maybe half of the dishes were typical Chinese things like bak choi and chinese style string beans, and the rest were American/Southern items like fried chicken and potatoes etc. There are desserts as well, but the thing I was most impressed with was the selection of the fruit, especially the cantalope and the honeydew. There are also strawberries and bananas and other typical kind of fruit as well.

The service is pretty good here. The waiters/waitresses are quite prompt with picking up your dirty plates from your table (you accumulate a lot since it is a buffet), and the guy working the hibachi grill is quite diligent and works fast enough. The people overall are friendly, and it seems like the ambiance and clientelle of this place is good too- mostly families bringing their kids out for a buffet treat for the weekend. I always do wonder though (since this place is Asian run, and I am Chinese) if asians get treated nicer at asian establishments. I think it's at least a little bit true.

Not really my kind of place overall, but I had a decent time. There's a lot of parking outside too, by the way."}
{"text":"This was not good food. I stopped in at lunchtime on a Friday, so there was no excuse for anything less than fresh food. To be honest, I couldn't tell if the food was fresh or not but I'm leaning towards no. It was bland and flavorless. I ate 2 plates only because I knew I was already paying so I might as well. I had sesame chicken, black pepper chicken, fried rice, chicken and broccoli, etc. Nothing was good and I will not return. 2 stars only because service was very good. I should have tried the hibachi but did not."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time here! We should have left as soon as we got in the door, only reason we didn't is because of my great grandma. She gets weak easily and we didn't want to make her get back in the car and out again. The food was cold, dry, and had no flavor. The hibachi bar was the only thing I wanted but that wasn't good either. The rice and noodles were cooked to a crisp. The only thing that made it edible was the eel sauce which tastes like teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"For all the rows and rows of buffets, sushi, hibachi grill, etc. you think there would be something that would have some type of WOW factor. I guess the WOW factor is that nothing was really very good. Most of the food was lukewarm, the sushi was not labeled, but as it was just sitting out by the chef / hibachi station, I was still a little uneasy. I tried a couple of pieces there, (no low sodium teriyaki) a small hibachi plate w shrimp (weird flavor - not your Kabutos fun and deliciousness), & the shrimp sauce was sitting there in a squeeze bottle (ugh). After I didn't finish that, I moved over to the buffets. Surely something was going to be redeeming there. Unfortunately not enough. There was quite a variety of seafood - craw fish, spicy shrimp, tilapia steamed and grilled, crab meat, etc.) I tried the crab (rubbery), and the mini lobster tails (I'd never had mini ones before and well, I love lobster haha), and the grilled tilapia was overcooked. It was just very strange not knowing how long everything had been sitting there under the heat lamps. The best part was the fried chicken wings, mac & cheese and corn - the American stuff, which I think they have to cater to families with kids. They also had a few slices of small pizza left out, too. They are trying to cater to everyone when they should just stick to a few things and make them excellent. Hubby said the $10.99 all you can eat price was worth it for the Sushi, though, and there were quite a few folks in there taking advantage of that. I didn't think it was, and I gave my extra \"Buy 2 dinners get 1 free\" coupon to a group sitting near us."}
{"text":"It seems that quite a few restaurant have tried to make a go at this location and the latest is the Times Buffet. They have a mix of sushi, Hibachi, and Chinese along with a mix of stuff you'd not expect like French Fries and pigs feet.

We checked it out to since my son likes sushi and his demands for sushi can get expensive. He was free thanks to a special they were running.  

If you go, ask to sit near the front of the restaurant. If you've ever been to a Ryan's buffet (a staple in college), the bars are in the middle of the store so you can sit behind or in front.  We sat in the back and it was HOT.  Even the hostess told tried to sit us in a better spot but it was still warmer than I had anticipated. 

It is what is it: an inexpensive $11.95 buffet. If you're expecting a culinary revelation, try the Jello."}
{"text":"The only reason why they got two stars is because the price is super cheap. The food is Meh and the service... Umm no. We went today and the waitresses were not picking stuff up from our table... we have five people and there was a lot of dirty plates. We put them on another table to make room at ours. Of course when it was put on another table our dirty plates were cleared out. Then the waitress has the gall to come to us and tell us not to put dirty plates on other tables. Do your job and we won't be doing such things. Please do your job so we don't have to do it for you. I only come here for the hibachi and sushi. Other than that, I'd avoid this place as much as possible. The service is horrible!"}
{"text":"Good variety of different food to choose from. I enjoy the all you can eat Hibachi grill and sushi. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday evening while in Charlotte on Business,  As Chinese buffets go, this one is a meh.. 
Most of the buffet items were OK though they were only warm at best.  They had some brazed spare ribs that were so dried out and tough as to be inedible.  Not a sushi person so I can't comment.  As Buffets go I'd give a middle of the road rating.  They had crab legs though I didn't try them.  For $15 with drink I found it a tad on the high side for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"Very attentive to offerings. Nothing running low. Interesting options with lots of fresh fruit, clams, and oysters.
Par for buffets but give it merit for being clean and the the variety.

Spicy shrimp with (I think) five spice? Yum!

Asian buffet? Yes, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly.... I feel these reviewers are asking for too much!!! It's a cheap buffet in Charlotte for goodness sakes!!! Rate it for what it is!!!! It's not a damn LV buffet lmao come on people!!!! 

This buffet is BOMB!!!! They have oysters on the half shell!!! YES it is true!!! And they have salmon sashimi and like 7 options for shrimp!!! 

My tilapia tasted like Swamp and the mac and cheese was flavorless. So I didn't eat it! Oh well.

The frog legs were DELICIOUS!!! My tuna nigiri was good also. I probably ate 2 pounds of shrimp alone. And the sweet potato was bomb! Cooked perfectly! 

If you go to eat sushi, oysters and the shrimp you will not leave upset!!! The crab was really good too I just broke the shell with my teeth. 

I didn't try dessert or hibachi but it looked average. There is an ice cream cooler by the hibachi I might check out next time.

The staff was nice and efficient. They should have a better policy the whole bring your kid to work day for every employee was a bit distracting but what can you do? The place seemed pretty clean and I didn't get food poisoning so I'd say all good hahaha."}
