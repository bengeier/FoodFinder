{"text":"We tried it one time me and my friends, it was the best experience ever. Max host us like a king, everything was delicious, we've enjoyed from a very unique night at his place. Really recommend for any occasion!!!!"}
{"text":"I had never experience dining like this.  Gourmet food within a comfortable home setting.  If you are looking for something different with an open table - great conversation, friendly and welcoming - with Mediterranean food from a fantastic chef that can come to your home, cater or even sit in Chef Max's kitchen - it will be worth your time.  Chef Max mentioned how much time and care he puts into the dishes - I definitely could tell the amount of effort and his love for what he does...cooking and sharing his talents.  I didn't like his food, I LOVED IT!  Thank you Chef Max for the fabulous food and conversation!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you are welcomed by the beautiful aromas of Max's home kitchen. We came as a party of 10 to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Upon our arrival, there were a delicious variety of salads, breads, warm stuffed grape leaves and freshly made lemonade waiting for us. Max's demeanor is warm and welcoming, and the atmosphere cozy. It is the perfect place for those desiring a culinary experience which is as much centered around the food as it is the culture of taking leisurely time to enjoy the company you are with. Two of our guests were vegetarians, and he was more than happy to accommodate their needs. No one left hungry. The only complaint was not having enough room in our bellies to sample all the delightful flavors in the dishes that were being offered. In between meals, a few of us even enjoyed a little smoke on his balcony while we shared stories and jokes. All of the food was crafted with the utmost attention. You can tell Max has a genuine love and talent for the food he creates. I would recommend this experience for anyone wanting to take a chance at trying an alternative to typical restaurant dining. Thank you,Max!"}
