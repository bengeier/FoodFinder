{"text":"We were really looking forward to the pizza based on the pictures on here, we really should have listened to the reviews instead. We ordered a large americana and a lasagna al forno. The pizza was greasy and soggy, not horrible but not good either.  The lasagna was a half container with a few noodles which were burnt to the bottom, a small amount of cheese covered with a sauce that was about 60% grease, look at the pics if you think this an exaggeration.  We didn't bother complaining since we won't be eating there again... But they were nice on the phone when we ordered."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Big Man's for years and have noticed a steady decline in the quality. Tonight they promised delivery in 45 mins but it was 2 hours. We called twice and they said it would be 5 minutes but it wasn't true. When it finally arrived the pizza was cold and the salad was wilted. No credit or discount offered either. We won't be back."}
{"text":"its pricey but its worth every penny .! amazing gourmet pizza and pasta, try their lamb chops , its soooooo good.!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Will never order from them again. I ordered a pizza over the phone for delivery and when it arrived, I opened the box and saw that they either gave me the wrong pizza or completely put the wrong toppings on it. I called the restaurant to explain what happened and the lady who answered the phone gave me the rudest service I have received in my life. She loudly exclaimed that they didn't make a mistake, it was I who made the mistake. She then yelled \"That's your pizza, ok?!\" and hung up the phone on me. So I was stuck with a pizza with toppings that I would never order. I ate one slice and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"Good pizza, lots of choice. I buy from here more than from the big names now."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I were working until 1:00 Am on Friday night. In the early evening, we wanted good pizza. Our offices being  at Eglinton and DVP, we were looking for a non-chain place that would deliver to us. I remembered Bigman's flyers from when I lived at 299 Roehampton and promptly found their website. I called and spoke to a very nice gentleman called Ilan.  He was very nice and told me that even though the delivery zone had Don Mills Road as its eastern limit, since were just a couple blocks over at Ferrand, it would be no problem. We were three guys and settled on a large Milanese : Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Brick Cheese, Olive Oil, Shrimp, Grilled Chicken Breast & Garlic. It was delicious and each of us had a minimum of 3 slices.  We gave about 31 dollars with tax and tip (price is $23.99).  I like the addition of Brick to the regular Mozzarella. it brings  some extra zing to the finished product. .  So, Bigman's lives up to its name: Big on Service and Big on Taste!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst customer service I've ever witnessed.  Never make the mistake from ordering from here."}
{"text":"Great pizza. If they get your order right. If they don't. They believe it's your fault. Bad service.  Not sure the older lady understands English that well. Great pizza."}
{"text":"Got wings delivered from here last week. Ordered 30 wings, 3 different flavors. When they came the wings were just plain and we got our sauces in a tiny little container barely enough to cover 3 wings per flavor. Terrible. And the potato wedges were incredibly salty. If we do try this place again maybe try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"This place is a 50/50 shot! When the food is good...it's great!  When it isn't,  it's horrible!  We have had missing items before (an entire pasta dish) but they were quick to bring it when it came.   Delivery is slow so don't wait until you are hungry! !"}
{"text":"I made this account simply to comment on this experience, as I have never once in my life been so infuriated by a company. To preface, I have ordered from here before, and while they are not very timely (upwards of 60-80 mins to deliver less than 2km away), the pizza is quite good. (4/5 rating)...occasionally they forget some things like extra sauces or drinks, but hey, it happens.  At 5:39 PM I ordered a large pizza. The woman on the phone clearly spoke little to no English, as I repeated my order 4 times and address 6 times (4 with spelling, and bare in mind I have ordered from here probably a dozen times before so I would already be in their system). I then asked if they had any specials, and she placed my order as a special without telling me what they were or asking  if I actually wanted one (I just wanted the pizza)  At 5:45 I realize that she never asked me my unit number or buzzer code, despite me telling her I lived in an apartment, so I called them to tell them this information, also at which time I realized she decided to place the wrong order, which I corrected.   At 6:35 I received a phone call (not a buzz) saying that the driver was in my lobby, to which I told him my buzzer code and hung up. 2 minutes later I received another phone call saying it didn't work and that it was ringing and nobody answered, I had my phone in my hand so I knew this wasn't the case. I was on a sales call so I was unable to run down to check.  6:37: calls again. Very annoyed at this point, I run down to lobby to see driver is not there. I tell him he isn't there to which he repeatedly insisted he was. I told him my address, unit, and buzzer code again and went back up to continue sales call.   6:37-6:49 Driver calls 3 separate times asking for unit and buzzer code, and address. I previously (following 6:37 call), sent him the information in a text message as he clearly wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.   6:53 I call Bigman's and ask what's up. They tell me he is next door in wrong apartment and will be over shortly. The apartments are about 50 meters apart, it is maybe a 15 second walk- It had been 18 minutes at this point to when he first arrived and I told him the correct information.  6:59 He arrives at my door with a freezing cold pizza. The order took an hour an a half, 30 minutes of which was spent in the apartment adjacent to mine. My sales call was interrupted 5 times by the driver who continued to ask for address, code, and apt #, despite being told each previous time and texted this information.   I sent the pizza back and asked for a new one, with a new driver, as this individual was perhaps the most incompetent man I have ever encountered.   Despite having called Bigman's to explain what was happening (more than once) they did nothing to compensate for the time loss, disruption, or quality of the food- nor did the communicate with the driver about where to go.   DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. The pizza is quite tasty, however in the future I will make this a walk in spot only. I'm sitting on 2 hours since I first ordered now, and it will probably be closer to 3 by the time it arrives."}
{"text":"EPIC FAIL!  I asked four times to change the pasta sauce from tomato to Alfredo, and four times the woman said 'YES YES we can do that\"  then my order arrived and they had changed the PASTA from spaghetti to fettuccine, but it was still covered in tomato sauce.  When I called back she claimed that she had clarified before ending the call, and I reminded her that I DID clarify before the call... after 5 minutes of her making excuses to defend her incompetence, she flat out told me that they were too busy to offer me a substitute, and offered no credit on my next order either.  The salad was mostly a container full of lettuce and a pittance of topping... low quality ingredients.  I ordered a cheeseburger, which on the menu it states:  BACON and cheeze.  It came with no bacon, covered in onions, tomato and lettuce.  I paid almost $50 for my food, and ate half a burger, the chicken parm, and threw the rest out.  I should have known better... this place has sucked for years."}
{"text":"So far in our first few months in Toronto this has been our favourite spot for pizza.    They seem to have an endless list of pizzas to try and the flavours are really different.  It is cheesy goodness and what I would call home style pizza but I haven't had anything in Toronto that touches it yet.   Will be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered two dishes took nearly two hours too deliver. I live on the same street.  Unreal.    Food was below average as well.  Too many options on Bayview to waste your time here. Anyone who gives this place 3-5 stars is either an employee, friend or a family member.  AVOID THIS PLACE..."}
{"text":"The \"Biggest\" part of BigMan's is the over-sized, confusing menu that it is as vague on some items as it is over-descriptive on others. The staff doesn't know the menu items, but the food is pretty decent. The sauces and dough are pretty awesome - and the pasta here is better than what's offered by chains like Pizza Hut or Dominos.  This time I ordered their small pizza combo. The pizza comes with tomato sauce, and a blend of mozzarella and brick cheese (not mentioned on the menu). I topped it with pepperoni, bacon and green peppers.  I also ordered 10 wings, plain, with medium sauce. And I asked for my garlic bread to be upgraded to cheese bread - because the cheese bread is sooo cheesey.  I actually really liked everything - the pizza was good, garlic bread came with cheese, as requested, and even the wings tasted better than they looked. I like them \"naked,\"(un-breaded) and find they are always crunchier and better when ordered plain and with sauce on the side, which is how these came, so I enjoyed them, although the medium sauce isn't as good as my at-home Frank's Buffalo. It arrived in 30 minutes with no delivery fee, so that's not too shabby!  Tasted fresher and was cheaper than Pizza Pizza.   Last time, I got the gnocchi with spinach, sundried tomatoes and chicken. It is an enormous portion - easily enough for two or three people. It came within 25 minutes - bonus points. The pasta was actually very tasty. The tomato sauce was very flavourful, if a bit garlicky for some. The sundried tomatoes were moist and spinach was well, there was a lot of it.  The chicken, however, was so completely overcooked and dried out that it was inedible. I just picked around it and ate the rest, satisfied.   Note that the menu doesn't mention the pasta already comes with garlic bread. I wasted money on buying even more garlic bread - which was too much. Again, I wish someone had explained that on the phone.  Their menu is confusing as Hell - to the staff, too.  The pasta I ordered was described as coming with \"sauce.\" No particular variety - cream, tomato, rose, olive oil - was mentioned. And the Homemade cannelloni doesn't mention what is actually inside of it - lol.  When I asked, after like a 5 minute wait, she said \"No meat. Just cheese and vegetables.\" Yet still no description of what kind of vegetables. That's a little odd... Still, it tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"My main gripe (besides the poor quality of food) and the main reason I won't be re-ordering from this place again happened through Just Eat. The only place to leave instructions for this place is in a box you type out. I am allergic to raw tomatoes so I put in capital letters this and ordered the rib eye sandwich. Not only does it not state that this comes with tomato but they put them on anyhow. I called them directly to ask for a replacement and there seemed to be no problem. The woman here calls me back to tell me I should of called up instead of writing out my issue with tomatoes....really now. Well if you expect people to do this, maybe you should have Just Eat update your menu profile. The sandwich finally showed up and now it was covered with red onions. I don't mind those but why not list exactly what comes on a sandwich on your menu. Common sense fail."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood so had their flyer handy. The pizza on the flyer looked delicious so decided to order it (margarita pizza). Turns out they don't have that pizza and don't have basil at their restaurant. False advertising and the pizza wasn't great. Not going to order from this place again. More for the false advertising than the pizza itself."}
{"text":"I ordered 30 wings.  They were dry, small, meatless, and not fresh.  I thought they were going to be Buffalo style, but they come plain with sauce on the side.  Bigman's should really read the reviews on Yelp because I'm not the only one to suggest they toss their wings in sauce instead of putting it on the side.  Wings were terrible.  Bad experience."}
