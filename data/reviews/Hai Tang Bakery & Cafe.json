{"text":"Walked in to this bakery twice and it was enough to disgust me.  Cleanliness is a major problem here.  Entrance is filthy, dining floor was littered with food and stained.  Staff was rude as I just asked for a milk tea to go with a sweetener on the side... She just threw the pack of sweetener on the counter, and then crossed her arms behind the counter with an unpleasant face.  I was not rude or anything when asking for my milk tea, handed the money to the cashier in her hand (not throwing at her or even the counter).  I will not recommend this place to anyone... if their store front is as disgusting as this, would the kitchen be any better?"}
{"text":"Please refer to my original review - it still holds true. I'd just like to add that I went back today and tried other dishes. The stir fry noodles (both chow mein and vermicelli) were very impressive! Not too dry and not too oily, they were flavorful and yet not too overwhelming. Great chefs in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to get your buns! I always come here to buy a pineapple bun with butter and a coffee for 2.10! Cheap and filling, all their buns are freshly baked and the staff are friendly once they get to know you.   Egg tarts are amazing and the food on the menu is cheap and delicious. It does get packed during morning and lunch and parking is hard to find in that plaza sometimes. But I've been coming here for the past 4 years and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. This is the best place for a cheap and quick meal. Their portions are huge and usually I can only eat half and the other half will be my next day's lunch. Definitely worth it as each meal comes with a drink for around $6-7 after tax."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Hong Kong Cafe that has not changed for as long as I could remember. I'm pretty sure it has been the same for 10 years back when I lived in Scarborough.   For whatever reason I decided to pop in here around noon for a quick meal. This place was packed! Like line up at the counter to order and people already sitting and more people shopping for buns. This place is a small space and is very busy. I generally only come here when Im in there area and am craving egg tarts. The egg tarts here are not the best but better than most. Last time I checked they were going for $1.10 each. I do think the price went up.  The egg tarts and all the other buns tend to go quickly throughout the day.  I remember trying to get some buns after work at like 5:45 one time-sold out completely.   I do not think I would come here on a regular to eat because it is so cramped for space. But if I am in the area and I can pop in to pickup some quick buns and tarts I will do it. I'd rather eat at Hollywood next door instead though just for comfort."}
{"text":"It's definitely a Hong Kong style Bakery & Cafe...  You'll get that unpleasant vision if you're not used to the somewhat uncleaned walls/surroundings.  I grew up in this environment literally so doesn't bother me and the other HK regulars as you go to this self-serve style Cafe.  The Bakery side looks pretty fresh as there's constant patrons coming in and out for both the Bakery and the Cafe.  I observed that the Pastry/Baked Buns were still coming out this early afternoon and looking pretty enticing.  You can even do your own Plastic SEALING of your items after you put into the bag as they have the Sealer right next to the register while the ladies are busy making Milk Teas.  The Cafe is also self-serve as you try to get a Menu somewhere and go to the counter to make the order, although the Prepared Food does get served to your table but it's still not considered waitservice.  Around 25 Daily Special items on the Menu, all are under $5.00 makes this a pure HK Cafe you leave with a Fiver easily.  Don't even need to tip as you pay first at the register, rather than after your meal.  Preserved Vegetable & Pork w/Rice Vermicelli($3.50) is a small bowl but it was filled to the top that would satisfy the normal person.  It comes with your choice of Hot Coffee or Milk Tea.  I didn't like the Milk Tea at all...  Maybe change it to Lemon Tea or Honey Lemon(Add $0.20) next time.  2.5 *Star*"}
{"text":"Never coming again. Small cafe that's pretty aged and dirty. The breakfast menu is written only in Chinese, but the All Day menu on the opposite side has both languages. I asked the cashier if there was an English translation to the breakfast, to which she replies that both sides are the same. Umm, no they're not. Had to get my mom to order for me.  They mixed up our order and gave us the wrong type of noodle.  They also messed up other people's orders too. My mom's soup noodle was supposed to be vermicelli, but they gave her ho fun. Ok fine, not a big deal but you could tell they were just going to push us take to it no matter what.   My own bowl had a pink lipstick mark on the inside. At that point I was done bc this is exactly the type of place that would just pour your food into another questionably clean bowl and hand it back to you. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is bc their milk tea is good, although I would consider it the same as every place that brews a decent pot.  Go to their other Markham location that's on 16th Avenue, much better quality food,  reasonably clean and much better service"}
{"text":"I love how they serve food and they don't only sell bread!  You can get breakfast and lunch there. The last time we got take out there and never rush to leave because they forgot to give us one of our orders. We called and went back so we got our missing order."}
{"text":"I've been a patron to this bakery/hk style restaurant for over 12 years.   Story why the 1 star: - the 'youngest' looking cashier (who works there for 3/4 years now) should be fired. I was there last week and she was swearing in Chinese for over 30 minutes. Mind that the restaurant at that time was packed + kids were there too! I noticed she's becoming more and more careless about her job and she would have a lengthy conversation with another cashier before she takes your order.   Aside from that. I would still come back from the value of combo they offer. Their HK milk tea is, however, lacking the milk and tea flavour (if you want HK style milk tea you're better off going to Blue Ocean/Metro/New City/Golden Horse)   I wish their owner shows up once in a while and I would love to complain about the unpleasantness of that particular cashier."}
{"text":"Hai Tang Bakery is like your typical Chinese bakery, except they serve HK Style Cafe dishes as well! From fried rice, and noodle dishes, to egg and ham sandwiches, their hot food is pretty good! Their Beef Brisket with Noodle Soup would definitely be one of my favorites, as the brisket is melt in your mouth tender and flavorful. All their dishes come with a drink, the HK Style Milk Tea being my favourite as it is rich and creamy. They have limited seating unfortunately and isn't really group friendly as the space is quite tight. You order at the cash, and they bring your food out to you. I've had many occasions where one order in my party of 4 would be 'forgotten' or missed. Not a bad place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Super inexpensive and quick meals here. They always smell of fresh baked buns and they have quite an extensive hk cafe menu.   I especially like the noodle soups and they always come out piping hot!!!   Milk tea is a bit sweet and really over done with the evaporated milk, so that's why I always choose to have a hk Lennon ice tea.   As with most bakeries, buy 6 buns and get taxes off!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back in the last two years. Quality of food and buns have gone down, past what's acceptable for my parents' standards. We usually grab meals at May Doh and buns from Luculus if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Hai Tang Cafe is by far one of my favourite HK style cafes in the Markham area, the food is great and the price is cheap so you cant ask for much more. I have been going here for almost 10 years and after you go there you will see why. It is a small cafe that serves food (for takeout and eat-in) and the usual Chinese baked goods.  Food - 4/5: the Singapore Rice Noodle and Curry Chicken Rice are my favourites there. I would even say that they make the best Singapore Rice Noodle dish in town and the GTA. What I like about Hai Tang Cafe's food is you get what you order, no bullshit. All other cafes and restaurants like putting in a bunch of onions, peppers, and random crap into their dishes that really takes away from its true flavour, but Hai Tang doesnt do this. Their Singapore Rice Noodle is simply vermicelli, curry flavouring, bean sprouts, BBQ pork and shrimp, and its delicious. Also, their lemon iced tea and iced coffee are amazing!  Price - 4.5/5: whether you eat in or take out there is no tip, which is a huge plus. A dish + a cold drink is about $7 total which is a really good price if you're looking for a cheap, tasty and filling lunch.   Service - 3.5: its a Chinese cafe that is focused on getting customers in and out as quick as possible, as there are often lineups to get a seat during the weekends and other popular hours. Of course they could be better, but I don't blame them and this is what you would get in any other HK cafe.   Overall definitely worth paying a visit if you're a fan of authentic HK style Chinese food and/or on a budget."}
{"text":"Where have I been in the past 8 years?  I have missed so much action that happened at Hai Tang.  This HK style tea cafe & bakery is doing high volume of business, and everyone seems to be happy.  What a sunshine feeling!  We visited for breakfast, because I saw a flashing neon sign saying bun + coffee = $1.68.  We grabbed a table quickly knowing this place get packed fast.  I selected 2 buns and paid for them at counter (= self serve).  My boyfriend ordered from the cafe menu himself at the counter (= self serve).   A lady delivered his order to our table soon after.  The portion was big.  During the meal, we saw some ladies topping up the bun trays about 3 times within 10 minutes (= buns are really fresh in the morning).    This is a small efficient operation.  The store is not sparkling clean nor is it dirty.  Unlike other HK cafes, they don't expect tips here.     Overall, outstanding place for a quick bite.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Bakery/Chinese cafe Its small and a bit on the dirty side but the food is very good. The portions are large and price is very affordable. You will get a full meal here with drink for $7 tax in. The food comes fast too there is quick turnover for the limited seating."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets for cheap food in Markham.   When they first started they were pretty much a bakery only but over the years they became more and more a place where people came for good cheap HK style food.  The owners actually also opened the Hai Tang Cafe and Ocean Seafood in Richmond Hill, but this place was where they first started.  First of all the Chinese buns are average tasting but cheap and good sized.  Where they got me hooked over the years was their set individual menus.  Ordering system is basically order and pay at front cashier, try and find a seat and wait for them to call your order (they don't give you a number)...Most of the workers only call out orders in Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin so keep an eye out for your order if you don't speak the dialect:)  A variety of HK style meals from scrambled eggs on HK toast, to Beef Brisket on Rice, to Singapore Noodles, this bakery is more well known as a sit down or take out cafe these days.  Best of all set menus go from $3 up to only $8 and they all come with a drink like tea, coffee, Horlicks, etc..!  Some of my favourites are the Curry Chicken on Rice, Beef Brisket on Rice/Noodle and a Beef Noodle Pickled Soup (Gwai Lam Mai).  Seating is very limited and more often then not full especially during morning and lunch rush.  A lot of people just do take out as well."}
{"text":"The spot for real. Hai Tang whips up Hong Kong style milk tea like nobody's business. Passing through this plaza, you would not think to see what's inside unless you're in the mood for Chinese bakery buns. I didn't realize this little gem was hidden away here nor do I see myself batting a lash at the little bakery cafe had my partner not aggressively suggest we have breakfast here.  The bun assortment is average but when I'm in they are always bring fresh rolls out of the kitchen. Must be a good sign. They get a 5-star rating because I have found my all-time favourite bun here - the \"Merican Custard bun\". I've tasted similar at other bakeries or Oriental grocery stores but, alas, I have a name to it. It's sweet with an almost-crispness to each bite, and not custard-filled. Other than that the curry buns, sausage buns, etc. are all quite good.  But I'm telling you, at the top of each and everyday all I want is a Hong Kong milk tea with sugar from Hai Tang. I'm always at an inner war with myself to not upgrade to the large size because either I had one just yesterday or they are cash only and I have too little change on hand.  The food menu is standard - I've had satay beef and beef brisket soups only. The service is speedy, the only thing that you should prepare yourself for is limited seating with all patrons taking their sweet time at their seats enjoying their food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare for a lot of HK-style bakeries in the area - bakery with a self-serve food court-esque 'cafe'. Their breakfast menu covers the basic gamut of vermicellis/noodles and eggs/sausage/toast combos. The food isn't bad; the prices are low."}
{"text":"Now I know where all these retirees goes in the Kennedy and 14th area. They really all hang out at Hai Tang Bakery & Cafe.  I never been to a HK Style Cafe that is so buzzing with energy and full of older people.. They are all just having a good time..  And with a coffee/tea  and any Chinese buns for $1.50 I don't blame them.  The bun though I found them a little doughy and dry.. and bland. However, it is huge in size.. and it can really fill you up!  So until then, I guess I will stick with my croissants!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is real. Yes, Pineapple bun with butter is a traditional Hong Kong café breakfast. Yes, it is typically served with Hong Kong Style milk tea. Yes, I am aware of what you may be thinking. Yes, it is a very thick slice of butter. Yes, the slice of butter is awfully thick and potentially arteries clogging. Yes, I ate it. Yes, it is crispy on the top and soft in the centre. Yes, it is the perfect balance between sweet and savory. Yes, I indulged with no regrets. Yes, it is as evil as it looks. Yes, it is delicious. Yes, I have zero ounce of regret. Yes, the quote \"a moment on your lips, lifetime on your hips\" is real. Yes, I am willing to live with this in my hips. Yes, life is good.  Yes, YOLO holds true! Yes, you only live once!"}
{"text":"When you walk through the door, the aroma of freshly baked bread flows through the air and hits you like a bullet train. This place takes their bread very seriously with many different flavours, shapes and sizes. My favourite one is called 'Pineapple Bread' that is nothing like a pineapple, the top is a flaky custard on top of a rising bun. The taste is amazing and it comes with a quarter inch of butter in the middle where it is a heavenly creation. Though, it may not be too healthy but its delicious.   My favourite part of this restaurant is there is a quick grab and go with freshly baked bread but on the other side of the bakery is a Hong Kong style café that offers noodles in many different varieties. I recommend trying the tomato cilantro noodles that has a spicy kick to it.   I really love the milk tea here and nothing beats the bun and milk tea combo for only $2. Definitely an affordable breakfast place."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I'm a regular here and have been coming here on average one or two times a week.  Very reliable cheap food.  Typical hk style diner with hk style breakfast. Under 6 dollars out the door you get an entree and a drink.  One of the few places that have good milk tea and not bitter at all.   Only downside is the seating is very limited.  They are very fast but poor ordering system as the servers come out yelling the dish you ordered."}
