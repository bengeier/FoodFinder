{"text":"Most amazing and hospitable Italian gem of a restaurant in NDG. The food is bona fide Italian, the tomato sauce one of the best I have ever tasted. Package that with the unbelievable low prices and the charisma of owner Ugo and you have a real win-win."}
{"text":"A gem in NDG! The pizzas are absolutely delicious. Fresh, the dough crispy, homemade sauce all made with love. The pizza comes with a salad included (the salad could be better) but the pizza is outstanding. Thin delicious crust. Fresh homemade ingredients. And then the desserts....the cannoli and tiramisu also homemade and outstanding. The cappuccino was perfect as well. We'll definitely return without hesitation."}
{"text":"I love the pizza at our local.  It is great!  We have been regulars since it opened and have recommended it to so many people.  But last night the rude and nasty owner made me realize that we cannot return!!! That and the horrible caprese salad of mushy tomatoes and bufala cream spurts.  I understand his lovely business partner has left the business - too bad.  It will not last long without him.  It was shocking."}
{"text":"Bring your own wine! Nice little italian place, a bit pricey but everything was delicious! Will go back for the caprese and lasagna for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here after a colleague strongly suggested it and I'm so glad I did!  Situated unostentatiously on Sherbrooke street, Pummaro is a small cozy restaurant owned by 2 Italian men (from my understanding). The prices are great and the food is phenomenal.  As soon as we arrived, we were warmly greeted and told to be seated wherever we wanted. Quickly, the menus came and we selected the lunch special at $15 which consisted of a pizza, salad, drink, coffee, and mini-dessert. The choice of pizzas was vast and it was fun to be able to look into the open kitchen and see our food be prepared.  I had the caramelized onion pizza and my partner, the meat pizza. Both were amazing, light, and full of flavor. Although we were scared by the size of these things initially (about 45 cm long x 15 cm wide), the dough was so light and airy, and the ingredients were not too oily/fatty/heavy that it was very easy to get through all our food. The salad that came with the pizza was a little bland but at the end, our tiramisu was super good which I guess in a way made up for the salad!  All in all, a very pleasant experience. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Neapolitan-style pizza at reasonable prices.  Try the Margherita or the Parma.  Prices range from $8.50 - $12.50 for a pizza that is generous for one, a little small for two."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Don't wait too long though, once he's out of dough for the day that's it for pizza. There's fresh pasta and lasagna as well. It was busy but not completely full on a Sunday evening. BYOB, there's a little store down the street you can stop by on your way in and get a bottle of wine or a few beer."}
{"text":"Probably the best, most authentic pizza you can get in NDG. Everything we ordered was delicious. To top it all off, this place is also a bring your own wine. For lazy nights, they deliver through a la carte express."}
{"text":"The kids and my cousins had a lovely dinner here this past August. The restaurant interior is small but the aesthetic details are cute (check out the ceiling-mounted bulb shades: metal colanders!). We had a table by the window which is the ideal spot to people-watch on a lovely summer Montreal evening.   For the most part, we all enjoyed our meals very much. The pizzas are truly the only way to go here. If you're Italian or from Italy (like my cousin), then you'll probably claim the pizzas to be very authentic and Neopolitan-like. Be forewarned, though, that they won't let you do any substitutions at all on the pizza. They won't add or omit anything from the pizza types on the menu. Which is okay, as there's a decent variety of authentic combinations, and they're all made really well, with a great crust and fresh ingredients. But if you're a picky eater, or perhaps if you have certain food allergies, I'm not sure this would be the place for you. Also, I had a Caprese salad for dinner, and it was sub-par at best: the buffalo mozzarella was overly chilled and firm and was bland and tasteless, and the beefsteak tomatoes were not quite ripe enough, as they were hard and also bland and they, too, were super refrigerated. The kids' salads that comes with the pizzas were also bland, consisting of a small bowl of green lettuce.   The consensus was, the pizzas are great here (and their presentation, on wooden planks, was great!), the server was nice, and the prices were very reasonable. But I'd skip the salads. We'd return when we're next in town!"}
{"text":"GREAT!!!! I am a pizza fanatic and this must've been the best thin crust pizza I have tried so far. The dough is amaaazzzzing. The prices are good as well; 12.50 for a Margherita pizza and it comes with a small salad. 10/10 would recommend if you like a good pizza"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The cook is from Naples, and he knows how to make an awesome pizza! I read the negative review from Carmine, but y'know, that's a little bit the Italian way. The guy is very nice, maybe he was a bit stressed that day."}
{"text":"Best pizza in MTL right now!  These Italians guys (from Italy... Not Mtl) know their pizza.  Crust is perfect and their base sauce is also excellent.  Portion are generous.  Price are a tad over what you're used to seeing, but it's understandable considering the quality of the Ingredients, which are savory and true to an authentic Italian pizza.  I'll be going back soon to get my pizza fix... Oh and don't forget the homemade Tiramisu!  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Wow! I think I just died and went to pizza heaven. Also what a great accompanying salad with its zesty zing and crunchy walnuts. If I don't have one of these Pizzas every week my body starts complaining. The perfect post summer soccer scoff!!! Bring a couple of cold ones or a bottle of vino and you'll leave very happy. Hats off to Hugo and the gang for pouring passion into their pizza and bringing real Napoli Pizza to Montreal. Lots of love from the Clan Campbell Mezzo/Mezzo."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. The decor is rustic and homey, and the food is authentic. The pizza and everything else is super fresh and delicious, staff is super nice. I don't go anywhere else except here when I want to go for pizza. Try the Melanzane"}
{"text":"You're guaranteed to have an authentic, tasty yet light pizza here with fresh ingredients and a fresh salad to come with it. You can't go wrong here."}
