{"text":"Sushi was great and inexpensive. Yes, they are famous for their sushi lunch buffet, but I have never been there for that! I declare that as the next frontier to conquer...

I had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.

 For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.

 I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend. Either way, I can't wait to go back for the buffet, but since my office is just out of range from here, I guess I'll have to wait for a holiday."}
{"text":"Love Ru's the only place I go for sushi! Great food, service, and prices. Always clean and fresh. Been going there for over 10 years and it still is my #1 go to for great sushi! Everyone I have introduced to the place to is now a huge Ru's fan!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for many years, and have brought many friends and groups of friends.    They have a great sushi menu, and their chefs are very nice.   Over the years I have had several friends mention that the restaurant smells bad, and I have recently noticed it starting to smell worse.  That's less than ideal for a fish and sushi restaurant.   

They do have a great menu, and the food is good.  The service is sometimes slow and it's normally very very loud when they are busy.   

Last night (Tuesday) and asked for a booth.  The host said they were going to seat me at the bar.  The restaurant was nearly empty.   Another hostess came over, and said we can seat you now at a booth but if we get busy we will move you to the bar.  I was by myself and evidently they want to keep booths for groups of people.  That is understandable I suppose, but when 80 percent of the booths were free does it matter that I wanted to sit at a booth?  She decided in her words to \"just this once\" sit me at a booth very rudely.   I asked her why it mattered and she said they may get busy, and said numerous times that next time I would have to sit at the bar.  It wasn't so much that they have a policy of not letting one person sit at a booth, and slow evenings, so much as how rudely they handled it.   I asked my waitress to speak to a manger. The waitress was very nice and polite, but told me the woman being rude to me was the manager.   I decided I told the waitress she didn't do anything wrong, but I wasn't going stay, and I may not come back.   

I didn't catch the managers name, but probably about 40 years old, slim, with long dark hair in a ponytail I think.  

I am torn, I do like this restaurant, and overlook the smell and poor service usually for the good selection.  I most likely won't' be back now and will need to find a go to restaurant for Sushi."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. I had a great experience the last time but last night it was just \"okay. \" Miso soup is supposed to automatically come with tofu at least thats what I know. But here, you have to ask for Tofu and then it's not just tofu; its carrots and zucchini too. Chicken katsu was not hot. And spicy tuna definitely was sweet instead of spicy. I wanted to LOVE this place. I'll give it another try and order different things on menu"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ru San's for about 8 years and always recommend it to out of town guests or friends new to the area. Great sushi and prices. You must start with a teriyaki rice ball and I always order the Gone with the Wind for my entr√©e."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with this place. Its cheap sushi which is red flag number one and they also have an all you can eat sushi buffet red flag number two. My fiance and I went here during the all you can eat buffet and I could not even eat my sushi. It was warm and smelled fishy. I guess if you are a person who is not the biggest sushi fan and enjoy cheap fried sushi this place could work for you."}
{"text":"Delicious! Try one of the specials.. Also good is the buffet. 
I love kiss of fire and their aioli. All makis are good too and much cheaper. Definitely a good location for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I've been to Ru San's a handful of times over the years.  I prefer a couple of other sushi joints in town mainly due to the atmosphere.
Make no mistake, Ru San's has delicious sushi and a huge menu to choose from.  I have no issues whatsoever with the food.  Also, the staff has always been very pleasant and attentive.  It really is a great place for sushi and I will continue to come here from time to time.
I gave 4 stars just because I don't care as much for the atmosphere.  It has a \"diner\" feel to it and it's rather cramped.  It is also a little on the loud side which I don't totally disagree with but when I want a quiet dinner with my wife I'll usually seek sushi elsewhere.  
This is a terrific establishment, though, and I highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Seems to be busy every time we are here, but they are able to get us seated and food out to us quickly.  Sushi is great and prices are typical of other sushi restaurants.  Plenty of TV's around to keep an eye on sports etc."}
{"text":"A hip sushi joint with great vegan sushi options. Excellent atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Had the fried shallot salmon roll, awesome! Very fair prices and a nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is place is by far my favorite sushi place on the planet. Service is always fantastic & the food is on point. Best spicy edamame's in Charlotte. It's a hole in the wall, but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great the service is terrible!
They're always rude.
They forget things and never apologize.
Awful I'm done with this place.
I recommend Nikko or Pisces.
They treat you like a valued customer."}
{"text":"Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are."}
{"text":"Yum! Very reasonable priced, good music. Lots of options for picky eaters. Go early or late or expect a wait. They dont have liquor but have a decent selection of beer, wine and Saki."}
{"text":"Can be a bit busy, but really great food.  Many types of sushi in this place's huge menu."}
{"text":"The Sushi Review 
Ru San's

Despite the fact that this secluded corner-style-deli type sushi restaurant 
Has become the trendy place to \"see and be seen\"; this spot is still hands down my favorite sushi place in all of Charlotte.
 Even before a much needed renovation in the dining area this locally owned hangout spot was notorious for hosting gatherings of local \"D List\" celebrities, DJ's, filmmakers and underground multimedia kingpins (AKA the F List) such as yours truly. I'm not even going to try to deny it, the first time I went there I was trying to \"hang face\" and see what the entire buzz was about. Well, I soon found out. You have to understand, most actors are servers, most DJ's live with their moms and most indie filmmakers are starving artists. This isn't exactly the disposable income crowd. The prices on the sushi menu reflect that need for value. The quality at such a low price is unmatched. They have a great selection as well. Try and remember that these reviews are all about the \"Maki\", baby. This was the first place I tried the now infamous \"tempura philly\" (soon to be known as a soundboy roll); a maki roll with salmon and cream cheese that is battered and flash fried in peanut oil. If you don't see it on the menu, ask for it - you will thank me. 
 Ru sans is the best affordable sushi I have had thus far, including some trendier hipper spots in LA and Miami. Don't get me wrong, I was as shocked as anyone else to find great sushi in Charlotte, regardless of the price. They are centrally located on the upper end of Park Road so afterwards you can take the long stroll over to SouthEnd for drinks or maybe catch the train uptown. In any case Ru Sans gets a total thumbs up from me and I would recommend it to anyone. Just remember that it is small, so get there early. The service could be little better, but \"this aint the ritz\" so to speak. Go for the sushi, go BACK for the price."}
{"text":"Very good sushi....on a buffet even! The selection was a bit limited during the lunch buffet but there was enough to keep my wife and I happy. There's no descriptions for the sushi just times it came out and when it should go back.

Service was adequate given that it was a lunch buffet, parking was OK, it was a little crowded in the parking lot but we walked in and were seated quickly with drinks shortly thereafter.

For good sushi fast, we'll certainly go back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi joints in Charlotte and I would consider myself a good judge after spending a few years in Japan. Authentic and fresh. Quite the variety of specialty rolls or just your standard fish. It can be real busy at lunch so expect a wait."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Wide variety and great quality. Some have complained about slow service but I did not experience that."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover and love sushi that won't break my wallet. It's hard to find a good sushi buffet location.  Let's just say this one is by far hands down the best sushi buffet in Charlotte. My brother and I decided to break away from China Buffet in Pineville to try this place and we are so glad we did. The buffet is from 11:30-2pm Mon-Sat for $11.95. Not only do they have fresh sushi rolls but they also have soups, salads, spring rolls, fried rice, salmon and other entree on the buffet for you to choose from.

The spring rolls are the best from a buffet that I have had and the salmon was tender and cooked perfectly. Even the desserts from the buffet was delicious!  It was such a great experience that I'm excited for my next visit. 

I will say that they get super busy so go as early as possible. We went on a Friday when they open at 11:30 and people were already lined up outside waiting.  When we left around noon, there was lots of people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Rusan's (weekly-ish) . Great place to grab some good sushi in a banging loud place.  I don't do their lunch buffet, everything else is grrrrrreat.  I recommend Chirashi Bowl no tamago."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and have enjoyed it!  Hadn't been back in a few years due to two bad experiences many years ago.  It made my boyfriend not want to go again so I had to go with girlfriends!!  LOL  Ended up trying it with him again last weekend!  Finally!  Great time!!  They had changed some stuff on the menu but that was ok since it is so big!!!  Took off one thing I really liked but that's ok since there is tons to choose from.  I ended up trying two new things that were recommended by the bartender and our server Justin!  Very happy with the teryaki eggplant maki and the tempura spinach maki.  And the cold saki was yummy!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times for lunch and this can be quite a busy place. Rightfully so though because the sushi is delicious! Usually when there is a buffet of sushi, it's poor quality, you can tell it's been out too long, and you wish you would have (or end up) ordering from the menu. Not this place though. They have a decent lunch buffet variety (not a lot, but enough) and I really enjoy their food. 

The one time I came for dinner, I was looking forward to the buffet and *whomp whomp* the buffet is only for lunch but their menu quality is just as good."}
{"text":"I loved it! It was Saturday afternoon I just wanted takeout bit I ended up staying for the buffet. It was more then enough food for me. I sat at the bar and chowed down I was in sushi heaven! I enjoyed the yelling from the bar which I asked and it means thank you! It's not alert the hostess silly previous poster. The soda thing is annoying but too much isn't good for you anyways. I an definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Ru San's tends to be our go-to for a last minute meal plan.  The quality of the sushi, while not the best in town, is always solid and doesn't kill your wallet.  I'm always a sucker for the Sinking Titanic Hidden Treasure roll because there is always the chance that the bowl may contain the token that represents a $10 gift card.  I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying. 

Along with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.  

If you want sushi that is of consistent quality at a decent price, Ru San's is for you.  If you want a quiet date, it is not.  There is a lot of yelling.  Kind of like Moe's--but Japanese."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite sushi restaurant in town...date night or with the kids. We tried to go tonight and were overwhelmed by the smell immediately. It was so strong I was getting nauseous. We got up and left once the bartender excused the smell on the kimchi. I told him it smelled like a sewage leak and was not being dramatic. His smug attitude had us walking out the door for good..."}
{"text":"An icon spot in Charlotte!  Voted Best Sushi in Charlotte on several occasions!  Having the sushi lunch buffet during this rare sighting of me in this area!  Please stop by and visit one of the best sushi joints in the queen city!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi spot.  The super power builder is $22 and more delicious sushi than two grown adults can handle.  Staff is so fun and friendly.  Best deal in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So gross. Had a long hair cooked INTO my rice ball. Then was told by the server that it was potentially mine.... I don't remember going back in the kitchen and rolling a ball of rice and embedding a long hair in it. Keep in mind my hair is above my shoulders... The manager didn't even address the situation and I was STILL charged for my rice ball. Highly disgusting. Will not go back and I will never recommend it. I always tell this story to people when they mention wanting to eat here  

PS your staff represents you, and they are all super rude..."}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian options--teriyaki zucchini and asparagus rolls are dope. Definitely try their sticky rice, and get some miso soup."}
{"text":"Cool place ! Enjoyed sushi! Definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"This is the best place in town for good quality sushi at unbelievable prices. I wish they would change up their rolls and try new things more often to new choices to try, but what they do offer is good. Even if someone in your party doesn't like sushi, there are plenty of other good dinner options. The cowboy Maki (all cooked) is a must have for me on every stop. I tried it out when I could only eat cooked items during pregnancy. Staff was always so nice to help me with selections during that time. I see some people on here complaining about the staff and my experience is exactly the opposite. We've never dealt with anyone who was less than professional and they are all truly nice to us. Sure, have they gotten busy and I had to maybe ask twice for a straw? Absolutely. But,  it wasn't thrown at me and no one growled. The only reason I won't go for 5 stars is it is so noisy for me here. I know it's supposed to be all hipster-ish and woo woo, but I don't need it and just wish the dance trance could be turned off at lunch time or dialed down to a 2 at dinners. I'd rather hear my dinner companions. It is a busy atmosphere to begin with and the loud music just makes it chaotic. Over all, love this place and will be seeing you for birthday this weekend!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, waited over an hour for sushi rolls, the 3 of us got our rolls, my husband ordered a dinner, he never got! I ordered another glass of wine I never got!! Asked to speak to the manager the guy we talked to said he was the manager & took my husbands meal off & 1 glass of wine, it was the managers fault the service was so bad, he sat 2 tables & 1 large table for the server!! Will definitely never go back!!"}
{"text":"People have been telling me how great this place is forever so the hubs and I decided to go try it out.  I am not a huge sushi eater but my significant other is a lover of all things from the sea.  I got the spicy chicken roll, the sweet potato maki and the kimchi maki.  The spicy chicken roll tasted very fishy, much more fishy than my eating partners tuna roll.  I was not impressed.  We also waited over 30 minutes for our food while our dumpling appetizer appeared in a little over a minute.  I still love some other places for Sushi in Charlotte much better. I will say the atmosphere and music was top notch though."}
{"text":"This place is the spot for sushi. And i am not alone seeing as how there was a 30minute wait at 9 pm on a weekday. The place was certainly a fire hazard by the hostess stand. People crowded, bumping bellies. But no one was complaining. 

The sushi rolls are very fresh and tasty. Considering that they have to crank out an abnormal amount- my rolls looked like there was a lot of time and care spent on them. I really enjoyed my spicy tuna as well. The spice was on point.

Best part after going to sushi- not getting sick!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte! We live in Matthews and will drive out to Park Rd. just to get it to go if we don't want to eat in! It's that good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ru Sans has gone downhill, very fast. This used to be a very fun place to get Sushi or go with a group and have some drinks and a good time. While the latter still may be fun, the sushi quality has plummeted.

We ordered the Pearl Harbor, which is a deep fried shrimp tempura entree. It was very disgusting and bathed in a very MSG heavy sauce. Did not like.

Additionally, the server set us in the back near the bathrooms and kitchen. What this led to was us seeing how dirty the kitchen actually is, along with seeing the waiters congregate and eat people's unfinished dishes in the back. Gross.

Won't be coming back and it is a shame that Ru Sans has fallen to this level. On the plus side, the sake selection is still very good and the lychee sake is excellent."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here.  But I am starting to get annoyed with the service.  Tried to call in an order tonight, placed on hold forever.  Got in and placed an order to go at the bar and was charged a \"service charge\".  Really?"}
{"text":"Delishhh.  Great lunch prices.  OMG roll and Grinch roll are amazing.  (Get Sushi A - great meal)."}
{"text":"Sexually Harrassed at this awful, awful restaurant. I didn't want to say anything because I thought it may have been a one off thing, but apparently, it happens frequently here. Disgusting. Can we sue? The worst part is management's response \" When I spoke to the manager his response was the most surprising of all. He explained to me that this happens regularly and while he was sorry we were offended it \"was all in good fun\".  I asked him if he thought it was acceptable for male members of his staff to treat female customers in such a way and he responded that it was \"just the way it is.\"\"

http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/03/rusans/"}
{"text":"Lots of different kind of foods to choose from. The sashimi here is pretty good, the price for everything is very affordable. 

The negative side to this place is the food takes forever!!!!!!!!!!!! Not fault of the servers, they were very nice and attentive. 

Bottom line: Good food, good choices, great prices but expect to wait a long time to get it."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and live walking distance from this place, too good to be true. Had the best yellowfin tuna sushi roll with fresh red tuna ever. Did not try the lunch buffet because it was near lunch closing and was mostly gone, but did notice they had \"time in/time out\" labels on each platter which shows they follow health sanitation and safety protocol. Hip and modern decor, slow but friendly service. Sat at table for over ten minutes before someone came up, for Saturday around 2pm lunch. Wine selection was good, presentation and quality was great, and definitely will be back. Love the nice, full wrap around bar for couples and singletons to sit and see the edible action in progress. 

Warning: this place can get packed."}
{"text":"The price was fair and the atmosphere is well...interesting. That is about all I can say. The sushi was terrible! If you like fried rolls with cream cheese and random other bits shoved in with overpowering sauce, then this is the place for you!  However, if you crave fresh finely cut pieces of fish, go somewhere else. 
I got a roll in which there was chewy connective tissue still attached! What kind of half cocked \"sushi\" places allows that to happen. 
To leave on a positive note, the service was quick."}
{"text":"I love Ru Sans!  I love the sushi, I love the decor, I love that at lunch I can eat all the sushi that I want for $10. I like the part of town it's in, and how you're greeted when you come in and when you leave. There are other sushi places in town, but I keep going back to Ru Sans."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in Charlotte and a nice spot to go with friends or a date for dinner too. Highly recommend. Great sushi at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"After three months back in Charlotte, husband and I finally hit up Ru San's this weekend.  We'd heard some good things, mostly from the vegetarian blogs and yelpers, and we weren't disappointed.

It was about 8:00 on a Friday night, and the place was hopping - luckily, though, the patio was half empty so we got a table quickly enough.  I have to say I was relieved; although the idea of \"diner sushi\" (as my husband called the inside atmosphere) seems cool, the inside was louder and less subdued than I prefer.  Sitting outside, at least we could hear ourselves think.

Our server was adorable, a young Asian American guy with a super emo haircut and an impish grin.  The sushi could have been shit, and I think I would have still enjoyed myself because of him.

Happily, however, the sushi was pretty decent, mostly because of the large list of vegetarian maki.  We ordered five rolls - the spinach, pickled radish, tempura tofu, sweet tofu, and dried cranberry - and they were all tasty.  Husband preferred the tempura tofu, and I thought the sweet tofu was the best.  We also ordered an appetizer of their veggie dumplings, which were served with a spicy garlicky dipping sauce that was out of this world.

Husband had a beer, and I had wine, and the tab still ran under $40.  For a nice night on a patio with some totally edible sushi, I'll take it."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Charlotte.

Never had anything I didn't like here, fun atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.

 I recommend the japanese bagel roll tempura fried and the sake mojito.

You will love it. 
Never been to the buffet though, go for dinner for fresh sushi."}
{"text":"As a relative newcomer to Charlotte, I try not to visit many restaurants more than once because there are so many places to try in this city. Ru San's is a little different though. My husband and I have been there about half a dozen times and we will continue to return. 

Ambiance is strange. Several have commented on the loud techno-ey music they like to blast and I will just say that its not exactly charming. Somehow, we always manage to walk in and get seated immediately, only to turn around 5 minutes later and see a line out the door waiting for tables. I guess we are lucky but we have never had to wait. It's very fast moving (I literally watched a waiter running back and forth across the restaurant on a Saturday night) ...but let's be honest here, you do not go to Ru San's for a quiet romantic relaxing evening. 

You go to Ru San's for cheap cheap cheap food that is actually pretty tasty. If you do as I do and stick to the page of $1-$2 offerings and just order a few little things, you can easily walk out of there with a bill under $20 for two, drinks included. Okay if you want more than one drink each, make that $30. Still a very reasonable night out!  Please do yourself a favor and order the fried rice ball. Do it. First of all, its filling and cheap. Second of all, it might be the most delicious little creation ever. I also usually get a couple of tempura veggies (their sweet potato and zucchini are delish) and a couple of their $1 dollar sushi rolls (3 pieces.) That is more than enough food! Their sushi is definitely not the best you have had in your life but you cannot go wrong with 3 pieces for a dollar and it is relatively decent. They have yummy skewers too if you want to mix and match. My husband had the scallops and could not have been happier."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite place in Charlotte for sushi.  Can get crowded at times but that adds to the fun of this place.

The buffet is good and is convenient if you are in a hurry.  Sushi is a little better when ordering off the menu but more expensive too. 

Soft drinks come in a can so there are no refills.

If you come with kids be sure to ask for complimentary Pocky sticks (chocolate dipped Japanese sticks) before you leave."}
{"text":"Always tasty and predictable.  Hometown cheers type place for sushi.  Rocking techno fun music.  RISING SUN WILL WAKE YOU UP!  Loaded.   Charlotte must eat."}
{"text":"I real high hopes. Let me start with first impressions. There was none...Really. The restaurant outside is real nondescript! I wouldn't have known this was location unless somebody told me. Also if you're looking for good wheelchair accessibility it has its downfalls as well. They have a semi ramp on the side next to parking to enter the narrow doorway. I was able to get in if someone held the door. Upon arriving you have to wait to be seated which is quite alright but if you're in a narrow entrance way with the wheelchair and a group of people, the people leaving the restaurant somewhat collide with the people waiting to be seated. I would give four stars for the wait staff! They are very helpful. We decided to come during buffet time because we had heard so much \"good things\" about it. I really don't get it. The food quality was mediocre. The buffet was not at all tidy. Most of the items that were laid out didn't even have a description of what it was leaving you constantly asking the wait staff, \"What is this\"? This I found very annoying. I found that not knowing what was in front of me could be dangerous if I had any allergies to any of the ingredients! In all fairness this place might be great for someone that's not really into good sushi... I could name a few other places that were so much better and a lot cheaper. I know it's all you can eat but after 2 rounds of trying to get a good selection of the \"unknown sushi\"... I stopped and got the check. I would return if a few things were improved. 1. Buffet station, it really needs a description of what every item is. Drink refills you don't have any! They only search my Coke in a can. Maybe keep all the hot food on one separate table and the cold food on another!?"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about my favourite lunch spot in Charlotte. Is the sushi the absolute best? No, but it is delicious! and for the price, incredible. I like the variety they offer and service and staff are always friendly. Their spring rolls are incredible and I love the bite-sized cakes too. My only tip would be to go early!! I can not stress enough how packed this place gets. They open at 11:30 and there were people waiting in their cars at 11:00 am - it was like feeding time at the zoo."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi places in charlotte! They have a great lunch buffet. It is the only place I have found Spicy tuna rolls with no mayonnaise in the sauce."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Really good tasting rolls for a Buffett set up. Fairly easy to get a table, service, and food within minutes at peak lunch hour even while having tons of people during a weekday. I don't think my water was ever empty. I took one star off because even though it's a buffet I have seen cleaner/better sushi buffet set ups (they just didn't have the flavor Ru San does), so they could turn the more picky people away this way. Still just as yummy as locals rave about."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, CA now but I miss Ru San's in Charlotte! Whenever I visit Charlotte I always stop by Ru San's at least once for lunch or dinner. 
Service has always been awesome, food tasty and amazing and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"For Charlotte, this is the best place to eat sushi considering we are no where near Japan, tuna, or the ocean. Love that the wait staff yells hello at you when you come in the door. Food is also priced well. Cow fish is overpriced and it tasted like cat food the last time I went. Ru Sans has that cozy feel to it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good decent food, don't go here if your a sushi snob or know your obscure or good Japanese fish. . American-ized, tamed down sushi, a lot of the fish are cooked, so you can have a whole meal with cooked fish. Fun atmosphere, good drinks. great for beginners  and those who are somewhat new to sushi.  Not authentic, buts that is what they are selling, new modern sushi with lots of fun and alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is great! They are extremely cheap for sushi and the menu options are staggering. They have great cocktails and always have a good drink special going on. This place is great for having drinks with friends over some great sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi buffet for lunch.  Usually very crowded."}
{"text":"I have been to Ru Sans before, but last night the bf and I dined here...he is a sushi \"aholic\".  I just started eating sushi about a year ago so I usually play it safe and get myself a phily or California roll.  However, last night the server offered a suggestion and so I tried something new.  I am so glad I told her what I liked because my sushi roll was soooo AMAZING!  There sushi is the cheapest sushi (priced\") in that Charlotte area and in my opinion...the best I have had to this date!  my roll was $8.95.  However, there beer prices are high which is disappointing because I do love a good beer with dinner.  I had a japanese beer \"(12 oz) and it was $4.50.  This price of the beer will not deter me from dining at Ru San's but I will be limiting my alcohol consumption due to the price.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for dining.  It can be a fun and romantic date night!  

God's Blessings!"}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine has been raving about Ru Sans for a YEAR and I just checked it out last night for dinner.  I'm Asian, and feel as though I can say this: finally, a sushi joint that reminds me of the ones I've been to on the West Coast.  Loud, not too expensive, full of fun sushi, noodles, yakitori...and other Asian people.  That's a good sign. 

The sushi is FUN.  The menu is huge, and usually I'm weary of enormous menus, but you can see how high-volume the restaurant is, and you can tell the sushi is fresh and constantly made. You'll get lots of deep fried rolls, and cream cheese laden ones, yes, but along with it, you'll find vegetarian rolls with nice accents like mint, or strawberry. 

Keep in mind, the sushi bar serves faster than the kitchen, so we got our sushi first, then our appetizers. 

The yakitori and tempura menu is cheap, and was just OK.  I didn't mind because it was only $1. The tempura didn't have enough panko crumbs, it was too batter laden and thick, but still I thought it was yummy.  (Think, Asian inspired bar food!) The yakitori didn't really have much grill taste...I don't think it was prepared on a robata, which is fine, but I don't think I'll order it again. 

The house salad was typical, but the ginger carrot dressing they use here, my favorite!  Sweet and tangy, creamy and fresh. 

Dessert was 50/50. The fried banana with caramel sauce and ice cream was delicious.  The wrapper, thicker than usual preparations, but gave the dish a nice crunch. 

The cream puffs, I'm pretty sure were one frozen from a box.  (I might have bought them at Costco at one point!) 

But again, if the people weren't so nice, the ambiance so boisterous (sushi artists yelling our in Japanese, or whistling) I may have given Ru Sans fewer stars.  But the service was good, the environment fun and casual, the sushi is cheap and yummy.  

Can't wait to try the $10.10 lunch buffet!

PS:  Has anybody gotten that roll on the menu (sorry forgot what it's called) where you can win a $10 gift card by finding a treasure inside it???"}
{"text":"There is a negative. This is overall a nice establishment....they try.  But I did not like the Ramen noodles here at all. They were not anything like Japanese Ramen noodles. I've never had random veggies like zucchini and bell pepper in Japanese Ramen noodles before. I'll keep waiting for authentic in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've found in Charlotte. I would recommend the rich and famous roll, the grinch roll, and the dynamite roll. My husband and I usually order three rolls to split and it always fills us up. This is a restaurant we consistently visit and have never had any issues."}
{"text":"We didn't order the sushi because my wife is pregnant. I ordered the Nabe Udon which had all the ingredients and was served boiling hot, but it was too salty to eat. Even the noodles got brown from the amount of soy sause they put in it. The Don Kasu dinner was crispy but the batter didn't stick to the meat. The server said she would tell the manager who never came by, but we did get some dirty looks from the workers and nothing was said or done for us. Don't order udon or donkasu if you know what those dishes are suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. Some of the best sushi value in Charlotte.  

They have a lunch buffet during the week which is a great deal if your hungry. 

My only complaint is cans of soda. If you drink more than a couple of soda that become costly. 

Overall,  I recommend this place for sushi to my Charlotte friends."}
{"text":"After working in a sushi restaurant I feel kind of biased toward other sushi restaurants. Feelings aside. Lunch was by far one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Charlotte. Came here with a group for a friends birthday. We were told they can't accommodate a large group. Finally getting seated it took 25min before we were noticed by our server. Over an hour later no food. After finally receiving our food nothing about it was impressive, more or less just filled the void. Took another 30min for checks and this concluded my first and last visit to Ru San's..."}
{"text":"3 stars for food, but the service was awful. Appetizers were ordered and all the food was brought out at once after wondering where the food was. Saw multiple tables served while we sat around waiting for the check. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love it love it!! Best sushi buff. anywhere. My lil sis got me hooked on it. And now my hubbie and i try n go every other week, we live in lake wylie! soooo gggoooooooooooodddddd!!!"}
{"text":"Former top 3 sushi place for me has slowly fallen from it's former glory. Been going here since they were half the size.

One of my favorite menu items was the seven spiced seared salmon, this was removed years ago and as disappointed as I was, we occasionally went back for other things like the lunch buffet and for their ceviche shrimp maki rolls. This roll was unique to this location but....they removed it. 

Anotha one (*DJ Khaled voice*)

Menu can be overwhelming, but there are plenty of people who enjoy a cluster-fck menu as proven by the insane wait time during peak dining hours. 

Big fan of Uni and I've never been fortunate enough to have delicious Uni here, it's always been bitter.

If you love sushi rolls with all kinds of stuff in it, you will enjoy this place. So continue to queue up, you have 1 less party in your way.

Note: Party of 4 adults and 2 babies. The babies didn't eat shit. As a 20% tipper, that's fine. Take the 18% instead. Thanks."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi fan and for my birthday, that's what I wanted. I got my best girlfriends together and told them all that I had heard great things about Ru San's. We were all expecting a great meal and I was incredibly disappointed. The menu is huge and overwhelming. It probably took us 30 minutes to figure out what we wanted. The service was lacking and my friends were quite irritated. I spent about $35 dollars on food alone (on just myself) and only got $10 worth of sushi I liked. I am very open-minded and adventurous when it comes to sushi but this time it was to my detriment. I have not been back to Ru San's since but I heard about their buffet which is supposed to be good and very cheap. I am always skeptical about buffets but apparently this one is delicious. I would recommend trying the buffet before going for dinner, at least you can try things without wasting a lot of money. I hope to have a better experience when I go back for the buffet but I am not expecting too much."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Came in tonight with a party of 4 (Tuesday) and they were on a wait which is totally fine because that means good business. Host asked us to wait about 25 minutes so we caught a drink at the bar. Bartender was really nice guy ( brown hair larger gauges). We were sat and waited for about 8 minutes for our server to arrive. Her first words she barked at us were 'you alright?'. We ordered drinks, a couple minutes later she brought empty glasses and no drinks. Drinks were finally brought and she said 'you ready?'. I stated we'd like to start with appetizers. The two dishes we ordered she talked us out of because they would take too much time according to her (we were in no rush and never tried to give that notion). Ordered the Caribbean breeze  (conch dish) and the golden eye. Terrrrrrrible. Oil soaked hot lamp dried spinach with a couple pieces of pencil eraser, chewy, conch. The rolls we ordered came after. I have a hard time paying $9.00 for a roll that had a 1/4\" piece of shrimp and asparagus in it and 2\" of tempura flakes. Ordered the sesame crusted tuna dish and the tuna was totally cooked (not described as such in the menu). I'm exhausting myself complaining at this point. I've served and/or bartended for the past 11 years (I hate that I even feel the need to use that as leverage about this restaurants review but I feel it's important)  I also worked for an imperial Japanese sushi chef for 2 years ( let me state that doesn't make me think all sushi restaurants are going to be of the same caliber). The whole place just really needs to focus on their food and service skills. Don't treat customers as if their are an inconvenience, and don't serve slop and call it food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The lunch buffet is delicious and worth the money.  Inexpensive Maki rolls so that you can try several kinds without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"Ru Sans is great if you're looking for lots and lots of affordable sushi (their lunch buffet almost cannot be beat). However, what separates Ru Sans and a 5 star experience is their wait staff. Most are very stoic and borderline rude. About midway into our meal we were handed the check and thereafter the waitress proceeded to ignore us for the remainder of our time there. I was rather put off, but the food makes up for the goodwill shortfall. Overall, I will go back, but with the understanding that service is not their primary (or secondary) concern."}
{"text":"Today I had the most tastiest chirashi  On the menu it says \"chef's choice\" leaving it to chance but oh what a delicious meal it was!  Totemo, hijyoo ni oishikatta no desu!!! Mirugai to maguro to ikura... Waaaa! Mata Kumasi! Doomo arigatoo gozaimasu. Gochisosama deshita"}
{"text":"Overall, Ru San's is an enjoyable place for sushi.  The prices are moderately low, the sushi is good, the menu selection is vast, and the atmosphere is lively.  Their only flaw is the service, which has been consistently poor, at least from my experience.  Either way, I think Ru San's is worth visiting."}
{"text":"The food is really good; I usually go for their buffet if I get off work early. :D

The place is very clean and nice looking; the prices are amazing for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Ru San's for experimenting with different types of sushi because their menu is great for that. Its rare that I find something on the menu I don't like, and you can totally customize your experience. The cost is really good for the amount and quality of food. 

HOWEVER...

I would suggest avoiding the lunch buffet. I would give that one star. I was really excited to try it because I've had good meals there before, but it was really sad. The sushi rolls on the buffet are the most common, most American rolls, and have very little fish in them. Really not worth the $10. Feels more like you're paying $10 for rice and cream cheese rolled together. Also, it was a zoo in there when I went. So crowded, bad food, and unpleasant."}
{"text":"I am hard pressed to decide between this place and New Zealand as the best Sushi place in Charlotte.  This is much larger and has a larger menu.  I only sit at the Sushi bar.  Their specialty menu excellent.  I've been there several times and it seems packed constantly, but never had to wait more than 15 minutes (even on a Saturday night).  The waitstaff is attentive and responsive which is unusual for such a busy place.  They have a traditional kitchen menu, but I've never bothered with that when such great sushi is available.  The only detractor is that with the large crowd it gets kinda loud. Go. Enjoy. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The best sushi buffet anywhere! Get there early or wait in line.  Stay late. Enjoy! Great place."}
{"text":"Sorry but the amount of salt that they put on their also fish and wings is ridiculous. 

I don't think I'll go back here. 

Every sushi roll on the buffet had cream cheese. 

The Ramen tastes like powder and prepackaged. 

I was so excited for this place."}
{"text":"Given this place several chances and each time was a disappointment, and I've never been able to understand how so many people love this place.  Food was okay but they up-charge for anything they get a chance to.  I once asked for shrimp sauce and was brought spicy mayo instead and when I asked the server for the sauce that I originally ordered instead of the mayo he said \"oh we don't have shrimp sauce\" and STILL charged me for the spicy mayo that I did not order.  If the server had mentioned they did not have my request, that would have been fine.  But don't try to charge me for something I didn't even order.  This place is always busy so you will wait awhile on weekends and is very loud inside too."}
{"text":"Great place for Sushi. Great ambiance though can get a bit noisy at times. The buffet is incredible."}
{"text":"I've been to Ru San's for both lunch and dinner.  I've enjoyed both occasions but the experience has been different.  For lunch there is a buffet bar with all you can eat sushi - which is awesome.  I definitely went a little crazy and left very full.  The sushi wasn't the best ever, but enough to satisfy my palate and a great value for weekday lunch.  Dinner is the standard order-from-menu sushi fare.  Ru San's has an overwhelming amount of selection.  They have a lot of inventive rolls with ingredients all over the place - I think I had one with beef at one point.  The crazy rolls are about $7 or $8.  Additionally they have a \"value\" section of standard choices that you can get for $1, which is fun and affordable.  I chose a crazy roll and a few value items and had a great meal.  On the weekend night I went to Ru San's the atmosphere was very festive - there were a ton of young people and electronicish music.  There was some crazy bachelorette party at one of the large tables (good for groups!) in the back.  They have Asian inspired art on the wall that is signed by \"Ru San.\"  This Ru San seems like a renaissance-person.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and I had an overall enjoyable experience.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I decided to visit Ru San's after reading the reviews here. Having eaten sushi 2 or 3 times a month, I can say with a doubt that the sushi here is just 'eh'. The nigri was OK, nothing special. Something wasn't quite right, maybe the rice was off. (missing enough vinegar) They had the usual standard fair of fish offered at most general sushi places. I always look at the menu to compare whats available to my home town sushi house. Ru San's doesn't compare. The 2 rolls I had were best described as bland. Not real flavor to mention. The tiger shrimp appetizer was nice to look at, but turned out to some sort of mexican/spanish combination. I mean tomatoes, onions, and avocado..  This was more Thai perhaps, but to me, didn't fit what I expected or wanted."}
{"text":"Decent sushi - Super power building is solid... But for as large as an establishment as it is, it's unbelievable they don't offer gluten-free soy sauce #trash"}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy any of our food... tempura shrimp: terrible and mushy. Chicken fried rice; mushy and weird flavor. Beef teriyaki tasted like breakfast sausage. California roll terrible. Japanese bagel roll so freaking disgusting. Fried ice cream ... okay. So bad"}
{"text":"Best sushi experience in Charlotte....both in quality and in value.  

I hate sushi joints who think that just because they are a sushi joint, they can charge $4 for a paper thin piece of sashimi.  Ru San's, on the other hand, will serve you two pieces of toro that are thick enough to throw on the grill, for half the cost.  Easily, the best cuts of fish this side of Japan...and I've eaten at sushi bars all over the US.  (HINT: sit at the bar, get served directly by the chef, and tip the chef after your first round of sashimi comes out...)

Also, the lunch buffet is fantastic for a quick lunch...some people get squeemish when they think of raw fish on a buffet line, but honestly, this place stays so busy at lunch the buffet turns amazingly fast...they are putting out new plates every 10 minutes...and if you are lucky, you will time your trip to the buffet just perfectly when they are putting out a fresh tray of nigiri or sashimi, because those go fast! (NOTE: they don't do sashimi on the buffet everyday, and the pieces are thinner than they cut when you order off the menu when they do...but come on, its a buffet!  Take three slices, stick 'em together, and you got you a REAL piece of sashimi!)

Service can get slow here during peak times, but it is worth the wait.  Enjoy some sake and chill out.  The menu is truely an amazing sight.  They literally have everything...if you've dreamed about it, chances are it's on the menu.

For those that think this is the \"Americanized\" version of sushi; that is only because you don't order the traditional stuff off the menu.  They have plenty of stuff for the purist as well!  Their handrolls are authentic, and their sushi rice is prepared in the traditional way (i.e. high rice vinegar content, very sticky, etc.).  If you want traditional, stick with the nigiri, sashimi, etc.... all you have to do is ask!  

FYI, authentic sushi means you are eating slices of fish, sashimi-style, over a bowl of rice.  No type of roll, other than handroll, is authentic, traditional sushi.  I can't be the first person to pose this question to the haters out there complaining that this isn't \"authentic\" sushi.  Why did you order the deep fried roll smothered in mayo and expect it to be \"authentic\"?  What part of the \"Muy Buena\" roll that you just Yelped about did you expect to be authenticly Japanese, I wonder? 

FYI: Don't order the deep fried, mayo covered roll (it clearly states what each roll is/consists of on the menu), then complain that it was deep fried and covered in mayo.  I can promise you a non-authentic experience if you do these things."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Friendly, upbeat staff! Huge menu with lots of options (the Rising Sun maki is my pick). Can sometimes get a little loud, but I think that's because it's just a fun place to be. Probably not where you want to go for an intimate, chill dinner. This is the place I like to go to with a big group of friends - great for celebrations. I love this restaurant. I've truly never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi, cheap prices .. love sitting at the bar for the free cucumber /crab salad !  Not the greatest of atmospheres , but it's a Charlotte sushi staple !"}
{"text":"Such a unique spot! I've been coming to this restaurant for YEARS and I am always happy when I leave.. No matter if you come here for lunch or dinner, the food never disappoints and they have a decent beer selection! I'm practically addicted to this restaurant and a solid reason its such an excellent place is because of their wait staff takes care of you, especially Kristina..her customer service skills are refreshing! She exudes the perfect balance of professionalism and fellowship."}
{"text":"The appetizers are great but the sushi is unimpressive. The rolls are huge with mostly rice. Flavor is ok. I will only go for appetizers. Much better sushi places around town."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here for a friend's birthday. We wanted it to be a surprise so called in a day ahead. We got there just to find out that they don't do reservations. So when one of my friends got there, he then told them we needed a table of 7 and he was told that he could not hold a table unless ALL of us were there. So that basically ruined the surprise which was a bummer. But moving onto the food, for appetizers we ordered; the fresh roll which was pretty much like a spring roll. It was really goos but I wasn't a big fan of their fresh roll sauce. We also ordered a tempura green beans, it was just basically green beans dipped in batter then fried. The tempera green beans was served with some soy sauce. I was surprised cause i really liked it! My friend had ordered a mango salad for his appetizer and let us try a little. It was surprisingly good! The mango, strawberries, avocados, salad and salad dressing just went great together! For my entree I ordered, the spicy seafood udon. The serving was more than enough. The aroma of the udon wasn't that pleasant but it tasted good. There was kimchi, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. My boyfriend wasn't so hungry so he just ordered a California roll and had cream cheese added in. The California roll was great! The rice was super soft which I liked. We also had spicy mayo with it, but felt that there wasn't enough spice, all I could taste was mayo. 

As far as the service, it was okay. We had to flag the waitress down most of the time we needed anything. But I would still definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It blows me away how many times I hear people rave about this place but I am not a fan.  Not even a little bit.  Every time I have been there the sushi has been warm- GROSS.  I have crowned this place the most over-rated spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ru-San's was my favorite Sushi spot in Charlotte, and the other day I went with a group of friends to give it a second chance, and well it was better than average.  The night we were there it was very slow .(Monday night) but the service was good, the beer was excellent and the sake bombs were flowing freely.  In other words Ru-San's is back.  The Salmon and Tuna Nigiri were very fresh and the tuna was sliced so thin it just melted in my mouth.  We got the house sake' and  dropped shots of it into the Kirin Ichiban and the Sapporo Gold to enjoy the sake Bombs.  But the highlight of the meal, and the reason Ru-San's will always have a place in my heart is the FIRECRACKER, if you go to Ru-San's this is a must, its a lightly battered and fried tune and rice roll with an amazing spicy dipping sauce, oooh it is soooo good, gotta get the firecracker."}
{"text":"\"Nigiri\" means 'two cuts' and this is two pieces of sashimi on rice.....everywhere on the planet.  I don't care how you price it.  Of the menu says 'nigiri' then I expect two pieces. 

The Saba smells."}
{"text":"This place is overrated in so many ways. Yes, they have a sushi lunch buffet but people only go to it because it's so cheap. Paying for a $12 sushi lunch buffet is not gonna stop you from taking a trip to the restroom after. Yeah... No thanks, I'll pass. 

Sushi is pretty bad. Lol I'm not even gonna sugar coat anything. The quality of the fish is not even close to being fresh.. So if you're looking for some good sashimi, skip out on this place. 

Basically, I'm no sushi expert but lets just say most of these awesome 5 star reviews are from people who only knows how to eat California Rolls or Chinese food. 

Service is like a 2 out of 5. They're nice but they always make me feel rushed. Like... Please! I just sat down, I haven't even read the front page of the menu yet!! I just need some time to read this book of a menu!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day and it was really packed because of the all you can eat buffet ( I think..) The service was good but...the food was so bad. 
I got the buffet & my husband ordered from the menu. 
The sushi buffet was super normal and kind of dirty and messy in my opinion. 
My husband ordered some tempura stuff and some yakitori. 
The tempura and yakitori were soo bad he didn't even want to eat it. 


Definitely not coming back :("}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in Charlotte hands down!! The decor is a bit simple but they more than make it up with the amazing and diverse sushi rolls and friendly energetic staff. I have such a great time when I go there it has become a staple for \"date night\" with the hubs!"}
{"text":"Ru San's gets 5 stars for 3 outstanding reasons in the world of sushi restaurants:

1. AFFORDABLE! You can order a ton of food and still not go broke. Sushi as cheap as $1 and $2!

2. QUALITY!  I've been here countless times and  I've never ever had a bad meal. Everything is top notch and high quality. Sushi bar reinforces this: you see all the sushi chefs preparing rolls in plain sight.

3. VEGETARIAN SUSHI!!! Yep, that's right. Ru San's has a huge menu, but my favorite part is the big vegetarian section. Big list to choose from, anything from fried cream cheese maki rolls to tamago egg maki rolls to kimchi cabbage maki rolls. And basically most vegetables you can think of, all prepared in a perfect little roll... heaven! This is such a relief from most sushi restaurants who have ONE vegetarian sushi option (which is usually way overpriced). Most of the veg options are between $2 and $3... awesome! 

I really love the Eggplant Sesame Yaki. I usually order this as an appetizer and reserve the leftover sauce as a dip for some of my maki rolls. This dish has cubes of eggplant, seared perfectly, tender inside, light crisp outside. The wow factor here though is the sauce, it's a thick, peanut butter like sauce, tart and sweet and nutty, with sesame seeds.  You've gotta try this! 

If you have room for dessert, make sure you order some Tempura Ice Cream. This is basically a block of vanilla ice cream, covered in sweet tempura batter and deep fried. Then drizzled with a strawberry (and sometimes chocolate ) sauce. I'm not sure how they keep the ice cream from totally melting, but this dessert will make your day... heck, it'll make your week. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time.

Cocktails? Order the Lady Killer... kiwi juice and sake. mmm!

Kudos for being open a little later than most places."}
{"text":"Like others have said in their reviews, don't come here expectings the most traditional sushi or even the best quality sushi - come here expecting funky rolls you won't find anywhere else, and you'll love it.  The Dr. Zhivago roll is great, as is the Punk Rock and Roll (and a ton of the other rolls I've tried, too, but they have crazy names I can't remember).  Order some yakitori skewers as an appetizer - the scallops wrapped in bacon are the absolute best I've ever had.  The lunch buffet is cheap and plentiful, but again, don't expect the best sushi ever.  Last time our server was mediocre at best, but every other time I've been there the servers have been pretty average, so I'm not holding it aghainst them."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi options and great prices. Only reason not a 5 star is sometimes your waiter isn't very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"my coworkers took me here and as a newbie to charlotte i really liked this place...the lunch buffet for 9.99 was pretty cheap and the sashimi selection was not bad at all...just be aware there is a buffet table near the front and another buffet table in the back area...for lunch time service it was really fast, i will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Boss man and I went during the lunch hour around 1:50-2:00 pm on a whim and walked right in at the tail end of the lunch buffet. It was crowded and as a result we choose to eat of the menu since the buffer seemed picked through. The service was awesome. We ate at the bar and I enjoyed watching the live action from the chefs/cooks. We got shrimp tempura and the chicken wings for the appetizer and I got the Chicken YakiSoba and he got the  Chicken Teriyaki. Everything tasted fresh and We'll definitely be going back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Another attempt at Ru San's, another huge failure. We ordered takeout that included miso soup and vegetable gyoza. They gave us pork gyoza (completely unacceptable for us as vegetarians) and sent us home without the miso soup, even though they charged us for it. When we called the staff was absolutely unapologetic. Their incompetence is truly astounding. We've learned our lesson at this point and will never make the mistake of giving them our money again. I encourage everyone to look elsewhere; Ru San's does not deserve your business or your time."}
{"text":"No longer offering any gluten free options says the manager today. 
A sushi place that can not do gluten free. This is a first for me. 
\" you can order rice\" is the quote I will end this review with. 
Bye Ru Sans, you once showed me a great gluten free meal, now you are not willing to accommodate. 

Best of luck in the future."}
{"text":"Ru San's has the most unauthentic ramen I have ever had (Tokyo Shogu Ramen). The sushi was pretty good for Charlotte, and price is good too! So I recommend just getting sushi and skipping the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I come here often,  I can usually tolerate the bad service because the food is so good but this time was probably my last time coming to this location.

We sat immediately and waters were later brought to the table as usual. Our server was so uninterested in his job as a whole. We ordered our food, two sushi rolls and two teriyaki fried rice balls, which are our favorite. Our rice balls came in a timely manner, we finished those pretty quickly and waited for our other food patiently. Being that the host sat us right in front of the sushi bar we were able to see our food come up in the \"window\" ,we also sat and watched our food sit in that window for atleast 10 min while we watched serval servers and other employees walk by it countless times. There was other sushi rolls waiting in the window along with ours and those were taken to their table by who I thought was the manager (bald guy), while ours continued to sit there. 

Finally our server, who we haven't seen since he dropped off our rice balls, walks by the sushi counter and I think \"yes! Finally!\" But what does he do? Takes a look at it and continues on his merry way. At this point I'm tempted to go up there and grab my own food but I refrain and continue to wait patiently. 

After a few more minutes and more than a few hangry glares our server manages to bring us our food. He never comes back after this, not to refill our waters, not to make sure everything is okay, not to bring us or pick up the check, or even to give us the change for the bill, he never came back, NOT ONCE! 

This place is too good to have such poor service"}
{"text":"Good sushi however this place has little to no regard for anyone with food allergies. Also I have ordered to go sushi numerous times and the order was always wrong. After this happening twice I started checking my order before I left. However then I had to wait another 10 minutes for the order to be remade. This in addition to the to-go charge they add to your bill (which is ridulous because I've been to many restaurants that don't ever charge for to go orders).  When we called later about the incorrect order and asked to speak to a manager we were told to leave a number to be contacted by the manager. Well after 3 more calls, we still never heard from anyone.  Also they always try to charge for any \"special sauces\" as they call it. Since they don't have gluten free soy sauce I always ask for something else to dip my sushi in that is safe for me to eat. However they always try to charge for it and I have to argue with the server that since they don't provide an alternative for me I have to get something else and shouldn't be charged for it. Funny how other sushi places that actually have the GF soy sauce do not charge me for any other sauce I request.  Sad to have such disregard for customers with allergies as I'm sure that sweet chili sauce isn't that expensive (I have some at home that cost me less than 4 dollars for a large bottle).  Since there are many other (better) sushi places in town that get your orders to go correct and don't overcharge for dumb stuff (like to go orders and sauces) I'd say I've probably had my last visit here. Shame because the sushi chefs are great."}
{"text":"I have been to Ru San's for dinner a couple of times. Their specialty rolls are absolutely delicious. I don't remember a single thing I have ever ordered there, but they were all eaten with delight. They have a selection of basic sushi rolls which are really cheap. The service here is great, even when they are busy. On busier nights, expect to wait quite a bit for a table.

I tried their buffet the other day with my brother. It didn't quite live up to my expectations that I have come to expect from Ru San's. Every single sushi was pretty much bleh. He didn't like the buffet sushi much either. Can't complain about the price though (less than $12 per person). 

Ru San's is definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte. I'd totally pass on the buffet though."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!  Only complaint was on one visit they brought my miso soup out after my rolls... it's typically a starter, so I'm thinking the waiter forgot about it."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, especially good quality for a lunch buffet. Wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here again but given how cheap the lunch buffet is the quality definitely stood out."}
{"text":"Came here one time with friends and thought the sushi was good and the food as well. I decided to bring my husband so I came in tonight and order a 3 rolls and a sashimi appetizer. The sushi rolls were okay. The sashimi was the best it Tasted very fresh. I asked for spicy mayo and I was charge for a $1 for it. Almost every restaurants that gone to do not charge you for spicy mayo if you dine in, the lady that put in the spicy mayo charge me a dollar for order spicy mayo. I was not aware or was I told that I be charged for spicy mayo. I ask the server and he said he was not aware the spicy mayo was on there. It turn out that the lady that put it in was manger. I decided to ask what was going on the manger was like we charge for sauces $1 it's on our menu, well I didn't have the menu on me and I was not aware of that was on the menu that I would charge for spicy mayo, the manger could have told me it be extra and I would not got it. She was really rude about it and didn't even bother to tell me it was extra until after I got it. Didn't even care to take it off and just left it on there even when I said I was not aware of it. The service I got was really good but the manger was just really rude, and should treat customers a little better. I understand but at the same time it's not how you treat you customers and you should always tell your customers  something is extra before you charge them for something. I work in the restaurant business too, I will always tell customers if there an up charge on something, even if it says on the menu.  I think this ruin the experience for me.  And it only getting 2 stars instead of 1 its because the server was very nice about it he kept apologizing when it wasn't his fault when the manger could at least said sorry for not telling me and I would not have mind paying it, not even a a sorry from the manger. Unhappy! Be Aware they will charge you for sauces for $ 1 without telling you.  Don't e surprised when you get the bill. They will charge you for things without Telling you I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. One of my favorite sushi places. Tried the \"Kiss of Fire\", \"Chipotle Roll\", \"Dynamite\", \"Cowboy Maki\" , and ordered the miso soup. The price was under $40."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch sushi buffet. Cheap and pretty good quality. There's also salmon collar as a part of the buffet, and that was very good. I've heard that the regular menu is decent."}
{"text":"\"SAKE BOMB \"  was the the first thing I heard when i walked in, sounds like my kinda spot . Ru Sun's is a great spot to be with some of the best sushi and drinks out.  I was first introduced to ru sun's by a friend of mine and can't stop going. Its spot where we go before clubbing, shopping, or anywhere else.  The people are so friendly and if you go often like I do they know your name and you start to know them. Oh, and you have to try the spicy noodles on the back of the menu they are the best."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered their chirashi bowl. It wasn't spectacular and I question the quality of the fish. It was very busy for a Tuesday lunch-- probably because of the sushi buffet that they serve."}
{"text":"My daughter and I found this place shortly after moving to Charlotte almost 3 years ago and it has been our go-to spot ever since.  We've been coming pretty much once a week and never grow tired of it.  For the price, the sushi is great.  We can pig out here for $30 and when we order an equivalent meal at a different sushi place end up spending $60.  

The Firecracker Roll is my favorite, but I also like to sample around the menu and try to get something new every time I go.  I also love the crab cake and grilled teriyaki ball.  Their miso soup has such good flavor and they use noodles rather than tofu.  

This is my daughter's favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  When I asked her how many stars to give, she said 5 stars because the food is so good.  When a 9-year-old says a place is a 5-star place then you know it's good, right?"}
{"text":"My opinion changes every time I come, still waiting on a verdict. 

The Food is usually good enough to over look it's short comings. The service can be hit or miss and the music is super loud. The ambiance is very eccentric with lots of different lighting and things going on. 

My Dishes: 
1st time..
¬∑Rice and fried veggies- my first time -  Good, wasn't impressed.

2nd time..
¬∑Fried tempura- sweet potatoes, zucchini, & potatoes- Delicious! The sweet potatoes were decadent, much better than the regular potatoes. 
¬∑Egg noodles with Brown Sauce- not so good, one bite and I was done. 
¬∑Zucchini, broccoli, and onions in a Brown Sauce- incredible!! Loved it!!! Yum! 
¬∑ White rice- very good! Nice and Sticky!!

3rd Time..
*Note to self and everyone else*
       ¬∑Sir Fry = Regular Brown Sauce
       ¬∑Brown Sauce = too sweet, similar to teriyaki

Polly came to the rescue and helped explain how to order what I like next time. 

¬∑House Ginger Salad- Excellent!
¬∑Ended up with the Stir fry- broccoli, zucchini, onion- was mediocre this time.  


My friend's Dishes:

1st time..
¬∑Tuna - A massive plate! She said it's a 10!! She compared it to when she had the Increadible Tuna over seas. Love at first taste!

2nd time..
¬∑ Salad with ginger dressing- omg good! We both loved it!!
¬∑The protein platter- It was good for what it was. My friend prefers the tuna better!

3rd Time..
¬∑Spicy Tuna- good
¬∑Scallops- good
--Better than the second time, worse than the first--"}
{"text":"OK at best. Sushi is not bad (there is better in Charlotte, most definitely) but service downgrades it all. Slow. Slow. Slow. We waited, 15 minutes just to get our bar drinks & it wasn't even crowded. Our server never checked in with us except to take our order and deliver the check. Just poor service in general. The guy, possibly  bus boy, who was filling up water and taking empty plates was on top of it. Would have preferred if he was our server. There was also a stranger rotten odor when we stepped in the door but I guess we got used to it because it didn't bother us after a few minutes. Not sure I want to even revisit that thought. Have heard great things about the lunch buffet, most likely due to needing little service, but that will be the only reason, if at all, we revisit."}
{"text":"I went around lunch time 1:30 PM.  The place was packed.   We waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the very back of the restaurant on the right. There was construction happening right next to us.  It scared me the first time because I wasn't expecting it.  At random intervals there would be loud drilling or hammering.  The patrons next to us screamed back \"we are trying to talk here\" and it would subside for a bit.  

We did the sushi buffet.  There wasn't many options when we went.  Every roll was some  combination of tuna, avocado, and cream cheese. Two were toped with tempura flakes or crab. Fried or unfried.  None of which were labeled so I didn't know what I was getting but I've had sushi enough to make an educated guess.  

Besides that the whole staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Overly spiced dishes make me think they're hiding the quality of the fish. We went there last night and the hostess was very rude, for absolutely no reason., that's the main reason for my one star review...big turn off! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Only tried the sushi rolls but this place lives up to the hype. Great food for a very reasonable price, although the service leaves a lot to be desired. We waited about 30 minutes while we saw at least 4 empty tables available. Decent draft beer selection for 5 bucks made the wait easier. The sushi rolls were all great, fresh, and really well prepared. Will definitely be back to try again."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi restaurant in all of Charlotte. As far as the quality of fish they receive comparatively to their prices is INSANE. They have updated a few items in the buffet with a few new sushi rolls and here and there, and a couple new hot food items as well. The price may have gone up to $12.50. But that's still a better price then anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great sushi I haven't try the sushi bar but the sushi rolls are delicious. Some many kinds of sushi with a touch of originality.  No complaints at all in so many years that I been going there."}
{"text":"My first visit to Ru San's was last Monday and I've already been back a second time! this place is awesome. I love the laid back vibe and the food is on point.
 
Both times I went, I ordered the Kiss of Fire roll and it was delicious. I also tried the crabcake and miso soup - also great. As a sushi fan, this is some of the best I've tried in Charlotte. The only drawback is that the service isn't super great but it's worth overlooking for the delicious food. I can't wait to go back and try more rolls! This is definitely going into my regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with excellent and friendly service. I have enjoyed several trips here, but just noticed an item on the menu that will make this my last visit. I find the \"Pearl Harbor Shrimp Bomb Sushi\" to be a little unsetteling. I do not believe that an incident which cost the lives of thousands of Americans should be used in thus way at a Japanese restaurant. Shame on you Ru Sans."}
{"text":"Came here recently for lunch and it was worth the money. For a little under 12 bucks, you can have an unlimited amount of sushi plus other items like salmon and fried rice. It's a little tight in there, but other than that, it's a great little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Look at the many many comments posted, this place is great, Ive been coming to this place for years, affordable and always a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place!  It's probably a good thing that I don't live in Charlotte because I would eat here multiple times a week.  My friend, Samantha, and I tend to come here every time I'm in town.  We love to start with a miso soup (me), a salad with ginger dressing (her) and the Hawaiian Ahi Poke... one word - YUM!!!  They give a generous amount of tuna and the sauce blend is absolute perfection.  On my most recent visit, I wasn't overly hungry after the soup and sharing the poke, so I ordered the 5-piece nigiri set of sake salmon.  The salmon as very fresh and cut into healthy pieces.  The service is consistently fast and friendly.  I'd also love to try the lunch buffet one day soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here and had to wait for a little bit but this sushi is worth the wait. We ordered 7 rolls (Fire cracker maki, West wood, Spicy tuna, Exotic, Krystal rainbow roll, Dragon eye, Wheel of fortune [I have posted images]). All of there sushi was very good. The West wood, Exotic, and Dragon eye were all crowd favorites for there good taste and presentation. The wheel of fortune was very tasty but a little difficult to eat as a group as the rice is a thick wheel with the fish and avocado on top and a heaping pile of crab but you'll need a fork to dish it out. The service was awesome as well, if you are unsure about anything try asking the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I'll admit that when I first dined at Ru San's at few years ago, I left feeling as though I had an average sushi dinner.  However, after returning there only recently a few times in the past year, my opinion has changed drastically.  They've doubled the size of the restaurant and offer so many sushi choices and sake drinks that I almost feel overwhelmed.  And by overwhelmed, I mean that I order and order and order because everything sounds good and then I walk out of there feeling like a stuffed sushi roll myself.  

For sushi, there are about 10 pages of items that you can order.  I have no idea what they are, but all that I've \"sampled\" have tasted fantastic!   I've even tried items off the $1 and $2 menu that were tasty.  Ever try peanut sushi?  It's a good \"starter\" item if you've never had sushi before.  

For a special treat, try a specialty sake drink.  Ru San's offers several different concoctions for $4.95 (formerly $4!).  I started with the Lady Killer (insert joke here) which was a sweet, fruity sake with kiwi juice.  I then got hooked on the Kamikaze and haven't been able to try anything else.  What is it, you ask?  Sake, lime juice, and a splash of tabasco.  Yes, it doesn't sound too appetizing, but it is oh-so-good.  You primarily taste the lime...and then it's followed by a little \"kick!\"  It's not terribly hot, but it does have that \"kick.\"  YUM.  I'm craving one right now. 

The atmosphere is a little loud with lots of energy and music, but with enough open space that you won't feel claustrophobic.   The service is a bit slow, but maybe it's just because we've always sat at the sushi bar?  Thankfully, that slower service is only for the drinks.  If you sit at the bar, you order your sushi directly from the sushi chef in front of you and you get served immediately after he's prepared it for you.  No waiting!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for sushi lovers , best value for ur money at Daley lunch buffet, great menu dinner always crowded
My favorite now in charlotte ."}
{"text":"Ru San's makes me happy.
While the wait sometimes is a pain, I live close enough and frequent often enough, that I know the perfect times to go so we can walk right in and get seated. At this point, we've memorized the menu and I like it. There is literally something for everyone and to satisfy every type of craving -- Sushi, check. Bento boxes with a lot of food for next to nothing, check. Noodles, check. Chicken or meat, check. Fried ball of rice dipped in teriyaki sauce, double check. 

I think the quality of the fish is no better or worse anywhere else in Charlotte so thats never been an issue for us and when people raise that concern, I always brush it off. The entire menu is extremely reasonably priced AND they have a cheap as heck lunch all you can eat buffet. Sure, you might not know what you're eating but hey, you're broadening your pallet. 

It's a loud, fun atmosphere and the wait staff is friendly and almost always on top of their game, they yell hello and goodbye every time someone walks in or leave - it still always startles me, but I enjoy it. The wait for food is usually pretty short and reasonable and my water is always filled. If it weren't for the occasional crazy lines (though, I think thats a good sign in the restaurant world) and the occasional waiter that forgets we exist - I'd be closing in on 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Charlotte.

I would recommend going for lunch and the sushi buffet. All you can eat amazing sushi and other options for 11.95. 

For dinner I recommend the spicy yakiudon noodles or the super protein bomb.

The staff at Ru Sans is awesome as well."}
{"text":"The service was good however, I think it wasn't busy hour for them-yet. Although I would understand if it was. The food was okay, not the best. My fianc√© ordered chicken and pork yakatori, and my BIL ordered scallops and shrimp yakatori - those were also just okay. Not worth the price though for an appetizer. We all got the ginger salad I love salads so I can't complain but the fianc√© says it's a bit too bitter. We got there around 5 and so it was dinner both my fianc√© and BIL got the Pork Katsu Don, fried pork cutlet over rice with an egg and mixed vegetables. I got the chicken Katsu that came with rice on the side and mixed veggies also on the side. I thought the chicken Katsu was good a bit bland but it was crispy and good with the veggies. The pork Katsu don was not a good choice because the plating made everything too soggy. No sushi this time maybe next time, if there is a next time."}
{"text":"Dinner was wonderful here! The restaurant is crowded, but the service is quick and kind. The menu offers a plethora of sushi options, and all the ones our table tried were delicious. The waiter was attentive despite juggling multiple tables, and I absolutely savored each bite. This is a delicious and affordable place for your next sushi outing."}
{"text":"Rusan's is an old friend. No seriously, I used to go there 2+ times per week and I was the Norm of Cheers.  But a move put me further away from it so I'm not as regular as I once was.  While Rusan doesn't come by anymore, the owners Kim & Hata have grown the business through the expansion. It doesn't provide the same swanky ambiance as Enso, but you can go in your shorts. 

First, let me admit, I hate the lunchtime buffet. Everyone loves it and it's a great deal, but you're getting the mass produced generic rolls.  Plus it's super crowded. So I order off the menu for lunch.

For dinner, however, they have a huge selection of rolls, but if you sit at the bar and befriend the chefs, the best sushi in town can be found by just asking the chefs to whip something up for you.  They come up with some amazing stuff. That doesn't help, Jules. OK, so some of my favorites off the regular or seasonal menus are the jalapeno Hamachi sashimi, the \"martini\" with macadamia encrusted variety of fish, the Tokyo rock & roll, broiled sea bass, the twice cooked salmon, and seared tuna (add green onion the old way).  I also like the tempura shrimp and sweet potato. Yum.  

Rusan's is a place where membership has its rewards, so why don't you become a regular? It's the best sushi value in town. You can bank on it."}
{"text":"There is a large part of me that does not want to write this review. I don't want anyone else knowing about Ru San's. I love this place. 

The Vibe: The vibe here isn't anything fancy or special. It can get a little loud. I enjoy sitting at the bar so that you can watch folks prep food. There is ALWAYS a wait on weekends, but they do try and move folks quickly. 

The Food: They have a full menu, but order the sushi. All the rolls I've ever had here are good. I love the crispy tuna roll. I have dreams of the crispy tuna roll. I even got a non-sushi eater to try it and love it! I also want to make a case for the Veggie Futo Maki. I know. You all just looked at me like, this girl is plugging the veggie roll? Does she now know how this works? Stay with me...I think often folks just phone it in with veggie rolls, cucumber, avo, carrot, done. This is not that. The veggie roll is interesting and full of flavor and texture! As mentioned, they also do a great buffet lunch. It's a great deal. I will say, sometimes the labels on the buffet aren't the best. But that's part of the fun! 

Go to Ru San's. You'll like it."}
{"text":"This place only having 3.5 stars is a travesty, and I have to infer it's only because people are reviewing after having the buffet.

Do yourself a favor and come during the evening.

You will firmly believe, after having done so, it's the best sushi place in Charlotte.

Three words:  Seared. Tuna.  Nigiri."}
{"text":"I have always liked ru sans, but they messed a few things up last time I went. Of the 5 things we ordered, 3 of them had notable quality problems. Nice people and a fun place to be in Charlotte, but I get a sense that quality is starting to go down."}
{"text":"If you're in for sushi that is not super high dollar or pretentious, go to Rusan's. The rolls are affordable (as opposed to other sushi restaurants that can charge up to $22 for a roll!!) and delicious. The sushi tastes fresh is of decent portions and some of the rolls are really fun. My favorite is the Rising Sun Maki. If you're new to sushi you can start out with maki rolls that include chicken or just try tempura fried items or salads.

The service here is usually good but every now and then it will be pretty busy and will have you waiting a little bit longer than you would like. They also offer a lunch buffet but I've only been to it twice. There is something about eating sushi off a buffet that doesn't sit well with me. I would much rather go for dinner and order my rolls to order ensuring the most freshness.

If you're down for a relaxed atmosphere with a tasty, affordable sushi selection, Rusan's is your best bet in the CLT."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, I had the Jalapeno blackened tuna with zucchini appetizer. Service was below average in my opinion, they were not that busy so they were supposed to be better. The place is neat and I heard they have great lunch specials but if the service is as low as average busy days - no thank you"}
{"text":"Ru'san's has never failed me. Always great sushi and awesome specials . The staff is always on top of it And the prices are not ridiculous"}
{"text":"This place is always great for casual Saturday.. or any other day of the week for that matter. This Ru Sans has a great atmosphere.. the cooks and waiters/waitresses greet you loudly and warmly.

Take advantage of the lunch buffet on the weekdays. It's probably the best sushi buffet you'll ever have for like what? $5? :)"}
{"text":"Ru San's is holding its own - and offers something a little different from the other Charlotte sushi spots. What you'll get here is more focus on the sushi and less on the decorations in the room. Fresh, well prepared, and a fun staff."}
{"text":"Ru San's is where I go when I'm in the mood for sushi but don't feel like spending a ton of money. The atmosphere is pretty casual but  doesn't forsake the clubby music you hear in most modern sushi places. There's lots of affordable maki, including specialty maki - the Hidden Treasure is intensely amazing. They have some maki offerings that are only 3 pieces, in case you just want a little taste of something. Super cheap tempura and yakitori as well. The tempura ice cream is heavenly. I'm a big sake fan, and Ru San's has hot plum sake which I haven't seen often. If you're in the mood for a hot entree, they also have a large selection of noodles, rice and seafood selections."}
{"text":"I enjoyed all the food! The angry spider was a-mazing! Here visiting family and it was all smiles! Service was slow but it allowed me and my family to bond more."}
{"text":"Apparently everyone knows about Ru Sans and their Sushi Lunch Buffet. For less than $12, it unlimited visits to the buffet with a pretty decent selection of rolls and hot food. And really...can you beat that for sushi?!?!?

Is it the best sushi I've ever had? Nope. Was the service stellar? Nope. 

But I love sushi. And for what they offer, the variety and the price, I'm sure to be back again and again. I also want to give their regular menu items a try and see if I can find a new favorite roll!

For now, just three stars...but it was my first visit!  I'll keep you guys posted on once I become a regular!"}
{"text":"Great service and surprisingly great sushi!

I live in Los Angeles but I frequent Charlotte for business. Tried this place for the first time today and the fish quality was on point. Even better than some Japanese restaurants in California surrounded by the ocean and fish markets.

Our party and I arrived here around 10:30 PM (due to our flight) when they close at 11PM but everyone from wait staff to sushi man greeted us with welcome.

We ordered the sushi sashimi combo and couple of  rolls and udons. Everything tasted exceptional and the service provided was superb. We will be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"I'll preface with the fact that I am not a sushi connoisseur but I love Ru San's lunch buffet. It provides me the opportunity to try a variety of sushi along with other buffet items like the soup, salads, calamari, and deserts. The fact that the place is full every time I go there (for lunch) is an indicator that they have something going that is good. Price is right and selection is awesome. Now, I will agree with one review below that expresses some frustration with the lack of labels. Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating but when it is so good it doesn't really matter. Ru San's doesn't contribute to my sushi 101 learning so when I travel for work and want sushi I can't carry over my Ru San experience into the more sophisticated sushi places. I'm still a fish out of water when ordering sushi (pun intended).

Go have lunch at Ru San's. It's fun with a group of four or more (of course, I guess that depends on the four)."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Charlotte! Always great sushi that doesn't kill your wallet and they have an All You Can Eat lunch buffet. My favorites: Punk Rock n' Roll and Philly Roll."}
{"text":"Love this place! I took my granddaughter here last week and we both agree the sushi and staff were great!"}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing literally any time of day. 11:30am is no different!! Ru San's has long been my favorite sushi establishment in Charlotte. It does not play around. Lunch time special is $12 for all you can eat buffet of fresh (yes fresh sushi buffet- crazy, but the plates go so fast that it HAS to be fresh) delicious sushi. Lots of variety too. Nothing crazy or over the top like a rainbow roll but all you usuals. Part of the buffet also includes nigiri, salad, fruit and little desserts. Lord- yes. 

I took a handful of co-workers there yesterday and we got there right when they opened at 11:30. We had no problems getting two big tables for our group, and the service was wonderful. They tend to churn people in and out around their lunch time buffet, but even with out group, none of the servers were hasty or pushing us out the door. 

My biggest regret is that I didn't get more!"}
{"text":"A lot of people praise about this place... I'm not sure why... I hate sushi because of this place. I got sick every time I eat their sushi. But if your friends insist on going here, you can play it safe by getting their regular dishes like fried rice or noodles (personal tip lol). Those are not too bad but I can't guarantee you'll be happy with it either. 

The atmosphere is very upbeat. Most of the time, the service is good. The sakes are good."}
{"text":"\"A Night at the Roxbury\" of Japanese restaurants.  The music is so loud, unfortunately it's the main take-away.  Perhaps it's not as bad on any night other than Friday or Saturday for dinner. It's a beautiful space and the food is pretty good.  I would give them another try if it weren't for fear of leaving deaf and hoarse again."}
{"text":"Great prices on sushi and a fun variety. 

We were warned the service can be hit or miss so we knew that walking in. The first experience lacked the service but the second was fantastic. Hit or miss...

The sushi was fun and high quality. We've done the classic California roll, pickled radish and the spicy tuna along with the specialty Gone with the Wind. The specialty Gone with The Wind will probably be a fan favorite for some time. It's a three in one giant disc that is a mouthy watering sensation. The rice Ball was okay... and that can also be said for the yakitori. Skip them and just dive into another roll or two. 

The restaurant is loud and busy during dinner. It's not the type of date night for something romantic. You might be able to find a corner but generally speaking it's loud. Huge parking lot and a patio on a nice day can also be added to the positive vibes of Ru San's"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The service could be better. Overall, it's worth it! Get the gladiator roll!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Our server was Michael H, very prompt and good personality. He has a lot of knowledge on the menu and ingredients for someone with gluten allergies. One down side was when my food came out i could barely see the plate because it was so steamy. Steam was coming straight in my face as I stirred my meal. Great restaurant. Will return with friends from out of town very soon!"}
{"text":"Ru San's has a very interesting atmosphere. Note that it is VERY LOUD. Last time I was here, I saw some customers giving dirty looks to the sushi chefs yelling random Japanese phrases. They also whistle when a pretty girl walks by lol That's part of the experience so just a heads up :) Needless to say, Ru San's is very casual.

They have an amazing deal for lunch. They offer a sushi buffet where the chefs basically make whatever rolls they please and they are brought out to the buffet table. There's a good variety, along with sashimi, tempura, salad with ginger dressing, fried rice, dessert, etc. It's only $10! I normally get it to-go because they give you 2 containers to fill for the same price! That works better for me since I don't eat much if I sit down for the buffet. Plus, I'll have some for later! :D

Dinner prices are very reasonable. I wouldn't recommend getting sushi for dinner though. The prices are very affordable, but you basically get what you paid for. I do recommend ANY of their Udon dishes. I've tried some of the Udon soups and they were delicious. I really liked the Nabeyaki Udon. They are called \"Big Bowl Udon Soups\" for a reason! The bowl is huge and will blow you away when it arrives (comes in a clay bowl)! The Spicy Yakiudon Udon, which is stir fry noodles with spicy garlic sauce, is also amazing! I choose mussels as my protein and it was delightful (you can also choose chicken, beef, scallops, shrimp or vegetarian)! Not only is the portion huge, it was less than $10 (the soup dishes too)!

OH, I almost forgot.. DESSERT! The Tempura ice cream is delicious!!! Fried ice cream.. yummm!

It's also a plus that they open later than most restaurants. Late-night hunger for the win! :)"}

sushi is pretty good but they dont have shrimp sauce...they have this mayo stuff that is not like shrimp sauce

they are always out of the cake which kinda sucks bc it is good

hot food is pretty good ....idk what the fuss is over this place though....Fuse in University is 100x better"}

{"text":"Ru San's staff sexually harassed my wife.  
My wife went to the restroom which is very close to the kitchen and as she walked past several members of the kitchen and wait staff yelled sexual innuendos at her while whistling and making lewd gestures.  This happened both as she went into the restroom and came out of it.  After hearing what happened I had her point out the member of staff that did this as she was visibly upset and pretty shaken up.  I confronted him as he passed by and asked him if he said the things she accused him of.  To my surprise he said he did and that he didn't think it was a big deal.  
We had not been seated yet and if you've been to Ru San's you know that people just sort of hang out by the front waiting, which is where we were.  At this point we were both very uncomfortable as other members of the staff were smiling and making it known they thought the situation was funny.  I asked to see a manager even though we were absolutely not going to eat here at this point.  I explained to the manager what happened but I was very surprised to hear his response.  He explained to me that his staff regularly treats women like this and  while he apologizes we were offended it was \"just the way it is\".  We had been to this restaurant before and had no problems so this came as a shock to my wife and I. I asked him if he thought it was ok to yell sexually explicit comments at female customers and he replied that he did because it was all in good fun.  Keep in mind other customers could surely hear the things said to my wife coming in and out of the restroom.  If you are ok with patronizing an establishment that thinks it's ok to sexually harass female customers then Ru San's is your place but for the rest of us I can say I will never go there again."}

However I think Ru San's still has some of the best deals out there for sushi, and the sushi is good and fresh. 5 pieces of Sashimi for $7 and these are not skimpy that is an awesome price.  For someone who likes to indulge in sushi a couple of times a week this place is great!  You can also get Nigiri pieces from $1 to $2 a piece.  This place is busy and stays busy for a reason it is great for groups if you can get a table."}
{"text":"You've gotta love cheap sushi. Even if it isn't the best you've ever had, you cant argue with $1 for 4 rolls. Just like pizza, it's all good, baby. 

Ru Sans is definitely worth a visit if you're new to the Queen City or visiting some friends. Don't expect to be blown away, but its great social food. If you're coming with a big group of loud and fun people that love to socialize, you're in for a treat. Ru Sans is awesome for a night out. Do a couple of sake bombs (if you're into that) or just watch all of the bankers do them. HILARIOUS.

Two words: LUNCH BUFFET. If you haven't had time to experience it, you're missing out. Again, not the most mind-blowing sushi you've ever had, but the array of choices and other non-sushi items is worth the coin. 

Service is kind of meh. Lackadaisical at best and certainly not super attentive to things like, oh say.....drinks? You might go thirst for a couple minutes, but fear not. 

The atmosphere can get a little bit tight at times. You'll be squeezing in between chairs and tables to make it back to your seat. Also, the bathrooms are tucked behind the kitchen in a long hallway. Pretty cool, if you ask me. Kind of feels like you're part of the kitchen for a hot minute. 

Love the art on the walls. Not sure who the artist is, but they are awesome and intriguing. 

Definitely worth a try if you've never made it out. Take a bunch of friends, grab a cocktail or do a couple sake bombs and enjoy the semi-glorious sushi. 

Cheers, Ru Sans. You're doing what you do rather well."}
{"text":"Oh Ru San's you warm the cheap, cheap cockles of my heart with your delicious sushi goodness. That is not to say that if one had a more ample sushi budget you couldn't find some creative and complex maki, for you certainly can. I, however, am a diehard fan of the dollar menu. That's right kids, there is a whole section of the menu where a Sacajawea can get you a 3 piece maki. That means that for less than what I generally shell out at Starbucks I can get a fresh mix and match meal including a variety of fish and sauces.

Their sake cocktails are pretty tasty as well (I first gave them a try in order to reach the loosely enforced $10 credit card minimum). Do be warned That if you are not generally a fruity/sweet cocktail drinker sine selections may be a touch overwhelming.

While I have certainly enjoyed the Ru San's experience with a group of friends and for dinner w/the bf, my favorite Ru San's trip by far was pulling up a seat at the bar (which has purse hooks!) by myself. So next time you are looking for a spot to grab a lighter solo meal, I'd definitely point you in Ru San's direction."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for inexpensive, quick sushi. I really enjoy their sushi buffet as well as their dinner selections at night. I would recommend their jalape√±o tofu and the yellowtail sangria sushi roll. 

I gave it four stars because sometimes the service could be better. They could be a bit better when it comes to customer service when something goes wrong. However if you ask for Allison she is by far the best server there. 

Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something not too fancy but good enough to satisfy your taste for sushi."}
{"text":"This place is good if you like sushi shops that smell like Captain Jack Sparrow's Barnacle Barge. You can smell the fish from outside the building, which ruins the taste."}
{"text":"Good, affordable sushi. I am a vegetarian, so I can't speak to any of the fish. I have also only eaten sushi there, no other dishes. I was drawn to Ru San's because of their veggie sushi menu. Since going a couple times, I have figured out that the weird veggie sushi combinations are not very good. I do not recommend the kimchi roll, nato maki (unless you're actually into uncooked fermented soy beans), Oshinko maki (the pickled radish is so flavorless). Here's no surprise, the most expensive specialty veggie rolls are awesome. Other than that, I would recommend the classics. I.e. sweet potato tempura, avocado, cream cheese."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Sushi and probably one of my favorite places to grab lunch. Main reason for this review is because of the NOISE the dishwasher was making (Human, not the Machine) on 3/6 after 1PM.  A One-Eyed bull in a China Shop would make less noise..... And probably break less dishes..."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte. I usually get to-go orders to avoid all the crazy but Monday night I went with a girlfriend on a whim and to our surprise there was no wait. The energy there is always fun, so it was nice to experience it all dining in. I go for the nigiri / sashimi most times but have also found favorites in the miso soup, chicken lettuce wraps and gladiator roll! Their menu is so big I wish there was an accurate copy of it online somewhere to make my to-go ordering a little easier but beside that this place is a winner for me!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Ru San's for anything other than their lunch  buffet, which is to say in few words - an experience. However, I have made the pilgrimage from my office in Pineville more times than I like to admit to take part in the great sushi gathering. All in all, the overall experience is always a positive one. It is always busy, but the staff always does a good job with drinks and turning tables to handle a mounting crowd. The advantage of not having the sushi made to order is you can get in and out with a sizable crowd in a decent amount of time. Also it allows you to try a lot of different sushi pieces. I will say that it is difficult at times to know what you are eating as nothing is labeled. Also many of the rolls tend to be simple or are deep fried. In the end, you can always expect decent sushi in high volumes for lunch. Also try to show up early to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Ru San's is always bustling around lunch time with their reasonable week day lunch time sushi buffet.  One of our group members, we had 4 for lunch that day, did not think she could eat $12.00 worth of sushi, but of course we all ate our weight in Sushi and had a great time.  Staff is always prompt with requests and the sushi come out in regular intervals.  There is very few times I have been there that we needed to wait on salmon or tuna sashimi or any of the other rolls!

Give it a try......but bring your vcal cords....always busy and loud and not a good place to hold a conversation or work meeting."}
{"text":"Great sushi buffet for a low price! We only waited about 10 minutes for a table and we got there at 1230. Full house after only 30 minutes of being open is very impressive. The sushi was constantly coming out since it was busy, which was really nice. The sushi pieces are made pretty nicely for a buffet. There were some fried rolls, but I wasn't a huge fan of them since the texture was kind of strange.  You can also trek down a little further in the restaurant to try some chicken wings, stir fry, miso soup, and a little bit of dessert like fruit, cake, or creme puffs. I was pretty full after 3 full plates of sushi and some miso soup. Pace yourselves when you come here to eat!

I took a star off because I often almost ran into waiters/waitresses who didn't really care that you were there, trying to get back to your seat. They often would push their way through so they can get to where they needed to."}
{"text":"Not sure if these other people are eating here with their eyes closed and no taste buds but this place is a disaster. Went here with the hubby (who shares my same sentiments) for the lunch buffet around 12:30. It was packed so we were excited thinking that since it was so popular it had to be good and after a short wait we headed toward the buffet. Most of the rolls were comprised of tuna and cream cheese. Not really a broad selection. Everything tasted the same or was pretty much the same roll with maybe a variation of cream cheese or avocado. Lots of imitation crab. It was just horrible. The other table looked gross, literally like not cleaned and never refilled. The soup was broth, nothing in it and it was cold. A side of eel sauce is a dollar which I've never heard of before. This was by far the WORST sushi buffet even buffet in general that I have ever been to and I will not go back...ever. The only plus was the service was great, that's it."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi, I love it so much I try it wherever I can, so though an expert I am not, I do know a bit about sushi. Ru San has the best buffet sushi I have ever had. I am not into all sushi, I love my salmons, tunas, love the ones with roe, love mostly uncooked and mostly die for rolls, your spider rolls, dragon rolls, spicy tuna rolls and so on. I tried every thing they had out on the buffet island and went back three times. I would have gone many more but I didn't want my date to think he can't take me out... There wasn't a thing there that I didn't absolutely enjoy. 
I definitely highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi.

This is a very popular sushi place in town - always packed. They do a buffet that people love. I am not really into getting up and getting my own food, but the price is a very good value if you like quantity. The good thing about it is that its so busy, nothing sits very long on the buffet line - so that means things are fresher than you might expect from a buffet style meal.

I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We took a huge group and did the buffet and I remember thinking for the price, it was a good bargain.

Nothing fancy, but you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome sushi! Definitely a bit over priced. I can only make it out there on the weekends and it's way too crowded at all times!! The sushi bar is great because it's so long but it completely eliminates a third of the dining room. They'd do better to move to a bigger location"}
{"text":"There are not many ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT sushi places in Virginia...but when I heard about this place, I had to try it especially since it is only $12 and all you can eat(I came during lunch time)!  Seriously what better deal can you get?  
Yes, you wont get those specialty sushi(which is why i give a 4/5 stars), but you get sushi which is all I can ask for!  The rolls are definitely packed and can be filling!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in charlotte. The lunch buffet is my favorite.....so many great rollls"}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Terrible service.  Way too overpriced.  I got the wild wild spider roll.  It was served with what looked like fried corn flakes???  Weird.  Our waiter was Pascual.  My husband never got the sushi he ordered and our server never checked back with us after dropping off the food.  His loss because we would have ordered another round of drinks and we tend to overtip.  It wasn't busy.  I wait tables and am completely understanding when a server is busy but this was not the case.  This was our second time and last time to Ru Sans.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Ru San's and go pretty frequently. I've never had an issue always great service. Last night we ordered an appetizer about 5-10 min before placing our entree. It was busy per usual, but I was unhappy when I asked where our appetizer was long after we had ordered it, even our entree. I was told take out was busy but it should be coming out soon. Long story short, our appetizer came out when we were half way through our entree. We were still charged for our appetizer even after I said something and when I asked for more sauce she said that'd be a $1 extra. If I had been told that the wait for my fried calamari would be awhile, I wouldn't have ordered that. Normally my experience is  but last night put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Monday night. We waited over an hour for the sushi. We only received half of our order. Never received our drinks.  When we complained to the manager he said that server would not be there much longer and he would take off the food we never received and a glass of wine.  Terrible service and customer service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The best deal in Rusans is their $10 buffet! I tried it and its completely worth it :)
Their sushi is good! i personally prefer their tempura rolls and my favorite Kiss of fire roll. The only con about this place is that its not good for big groups. They always run into issues whenever we are more than 6 people on accomodating us. Also the ambience is too loud.. I do enjoy it but sometimes it gets annoying.
Overall iits a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Why can I say, 11 dollars and I can eat unlimited Samon Sashimi. It s one of the best and reasonable restaurant I ve ever been to. I personally like Sashimi, so it s the right place for me and those of you who enjoy Sashimi to go. The other dishes? Hmm, not so good... but for this price and this quality of food, I ll give it full points."}
{"text":"I love rusans!!! I always go for lunch and they never disappoint. The sushi is always great and fresh. It's always busy but we usually get seated rather quickly. I definitely recommend it for people who are just trying to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was really tempted to give this one star. Hostess was not personable at all... boarderline rude. We should have walked away then. However we were sat in an uncomfortable booth (after waiting 20 minutes despite there being nearly a dozen clear tables). 

We had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our waiter to come over for the first time. (I guess they were short wait staff that night... but come on, it was a Saturday night). The waiter wasn't very knowledge of the beer options or the menu overall. 

Spicy edamame was a bowl of regular edamame with a pile of salt and spices on the side?... didn't really understand that. 

The sushi wasn't very good... I've always heard not to expect much from the service, but the food was good. I'd beg to differ. They have about 85 specialty rolls to choose from which I found to just be annoying. Pick a dozen or so and do those really well instead of having a bunch of redundant rolls with weird names. 

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my family favorite place to go to. So you know what I'm going to say next. We go here all the time. However, I really dislike their services. I can't remember a single time I come here and receive exceptional customer service. One time, we had a group of 7 girls. They seated us toward the back. Didn't see our waiter for like 15 mins. When he greeted us, he never asked us if we wanted anything to drinks. Just ask if we know what we want to order. My family can consume large amount of sushi. Believe me... So we order a lot. After he drop off our orders. He never came back to fill our water, check up on us or even clear out some of the dirty, empty plates. When we finally said something to him about it, he said well why did you get seated toward the back. They tend to forget about the back tables. My jaw drop and I had to pick it up from the floor. Well no tips for you mister.... 
They do have great sushi. It's a lively, loud and fun place on the weekend. Sushi are priced nicely. I never had a bad sushi roll there and they have plenty to pick from. I love their fried ice cream. I get it every time. I tell people about their sushi buffet all the time. But I alway mention, don't alway except great customer service because they definitely lack that there. 
I will go and have been back to RuSan. However, I just wish they step up their customer services. I know it get a bit crazy and crowded. But a little attention will go far and could've score more stars from peeps like me."}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls in Charlotte, no one comes close. I have been coming to Ru San's pretty regularly for about 3 years now and it feels like it's only gotten better. Ru San's vibe is no frills, fast and casual, loud, great sushi. Items from the grill (hibachi chicken, rice, etc...) are also notably good, but Ru San's really shines with their specialty rolls that can get pretty interesting. I've tried several and haven't had a bad one yet. The quality of the fish has never been in question. Just because Ru San's prices are stellar, doesn't mean you suffer on fish quality. Try the nigiri and see for yourself (salmon is amazing). 

Service is consistently on point, fun, and friendly. The employees share a collective mood of \"we're having a good time, are you?\". Ru San's Achilles heel could be its extensive menu selection. They don't do everything great, but it's a sushi restaurant that conveniently caters to non-sushi eaters, so I'm ranking it on sushi. 5 stars without a doubt, until they prove me otherwise. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good. Ordered the Gladiator and Kiss of Fire. One perplexing thing was the 10% surcharge for a pickup order. You'd think it would be less expensive for the place to have someone pick it up. Gave it 4 stars because of this."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The sushi is fresh and the folks are so nice.  If you go, you really have to try the twice cooked smoked salmon Maki- It was FABULOUS.  My fiance always get the cowboy Maki.  The miso soup is wonderful and they always have specials.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is because they close from 230-430p and sometimes that's the perfect lunch time (not a crowd) but the place is so good, my fiance and I waited for an 1/2 hour until they re-opened.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just take a look at the servers wearing the \"Got Sushi\" shirts (think \"Got Milk\") and you know that Ru San's is in the mix.  With a 6-page sushi menu and reguarly-changing specials, ordering sushi can be a nightmare for the indecisive orderer, but it's all good here.  I think there is better-quality fish in Charlotte, but the rolls here are fun and different....  Though the really tasty ones (Flying Kamikaze and Rising Sun) tend to be fried and saucy, there are a bunch of healthier rolls like the terriyaki eggplant, ceviche shrimp, and ginger-simmered tuna.  The yakitori is good, too."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive great tasting sushi... they have some really great creations. Always welcome you when you walk in the door"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down. The lunch buffet is amazing. Awesome sushi, and it's all you can eat. There is fried rice, chicken teriyaki and the like as well but I always pig out on the sushi. Can't beat it for $12. I come as often as I can and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Charlotte has a ton of sushi options, from cheap and bad, to fancy and overpriced. But RuSans is the perfect blend of affordable and tasting amazing. They get very creative with their signature rolls and rotating specials. Those guys behind the counter are magic, and always super friendly. 

And to make this place even better, their weekday \"all-you-can-eat\" lunch special is second to none. And it's not a secret either, so if you want to try it out get there early because there will be a line."}
{"text":"Good for fast sushi!  Lunch buffet is awesome. Like the draft beer as well. Try seasonal rolls too!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for sushi at any time. Working off Park road I try to visit the lunch buffet at least once a week. Girlfriend lives 2 streets away in Dilworth so I head here with her for dinner.

Their regular standard issue sushi is just average. They make up for it in having the best tempura rolls around.

On top of all that? It's cheap!"}
{"text":"I love me Ru Sans.  Its like crazy hibatchi meets sushi.  People are yelling and things are just a blast.  Also, their menu is pretty big which is actually a good thing for once.  The appetizers are decent here especially the mussels.  The sashimi is good and oh did I mention they have a mofoin $1.50 menu?!  You get 3-4 pieces of sushi for a 6 quarters.  As with this, you might think the sushi is trash.  No, actually the sushi is better than some more expensive places in the area. The drink selection is great and for the price you just can beat Ru Sans."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte! I'm a Southern California transplant and this IS good! We're so happy to have found this place. The fish is fresh! The rolls are awesome! I've been here 6 months and was worried I would never get good sushi in NC. Ru-Sans is amazing!"}
{"text":"After many people asked me if I have tried Ru San's, I finally went! We were welcomed by all the sushi chefs yelling greetings. The staff were very much sports fans and would celebrate when a good play was made.

The portions were large and the sushi pieces and rolls were inexpensive. The menu is slightly overwhelming because of all they offer. The service was good, the selection was plentiful, but the quality of the food was lacking (I guess you get what you pay for.)

The restaurant itself was big, open, and bright. The music was loud and seemed a bit \"club-esce.\" It would be great if the place was packed, but it seemed a bit off when there were only 3-4 tables filled and it was daytime. 

Not bad for something quick, but definitely not a place I crave. And as you leave, all the chefs say goodbye too. I think the greeting and the salutation was awesome."}
{"text":"I normally like Rusans when we eat in. However, I ordered takeout and the lettuce in our salads was disgusting. I am very disappointed in the quality. It should be really easy to tell this lettuce should not have been served."}
{"text":"It was ok.  It took forever to get our food which was 4 rolls & an entree.  When it did come the entree was the wrong one.  

The American roll had a lot of rice on that tower w/the flag.   Tempura was tempura & everything was what would be expected from a Dynamite, Rainbow & one of the specialty rolls."}
{"text":"I became a fan of Ru San's YEARS ago when I used to go to another sushi joint.  I was pulled away by three things, the wonderful and lively atmosphere, the quality of the sushi and the price.  You just can't beat them on any of those.  If you prefer a quiet or intimate place, do not go here.  This place is all about energy-especially Friday and Saturday nights and during lunch buffet.  The lunch buffet is pretty darn good, but the menu is awesome from sushi-sashimi-tempura-etc. to the entrees.  I personally love the sashimi combos."}
{"text":"Won't seat party of 3 with 1 person not here with 20 tables open. I would have bought app and beers while waiting. Ridiculous rule when restaurant is practically empty"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Walked in with my family and upon being seated was informed that my sister with a severe food allergy couldn't bring her own food in a small box. Upon explaining the allergy, the hostess said in a rude manner it was against \"health code\" (FYI... There is no law against bringing food to a restaurant unless you sell the food brought).

We left. I refuse to support an establishment that is unwelcoming to willingly paying customers. No food could ever be worth such a negative experience."}
{"text":"Why soy serious?!? SUSHI IS SO GOOD. We had a 25 minute wait, and we had to wait for our food but we were there on a Saturday night.

There was a wide array of sushi combinations to choose from. I ended up choosing the Kiss of Fire only because the name of it was intriguing. It was a great sushi roll, with a sweet sauce on top, and there was a nice crunch in the middle. It was 8 pieces so I ordered a side to ensure it was filling.

I ordered the curry rice; which was a fried ball of rice with curry sauce on top! The sauce was amazing, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"It's just very OK sushi. Mediocre. It's where I sometimes drop in for takeout when I'm having a cravings for sushi and my girlfriends and I can't get together to go to O-Ku (Which is amazing BTW if you've never been GO, they have half off sushi Mon & Wed from 5-7 too! Best sushi in town). The rolls here have WAY too much rice, making the pieces GIANT. I have to half them (annoying). I end up picking off about 50% of the rice (why are you overloading me with unnecessary white flour carbs?!LOL) Any of the fried rolls I've gotten are the kind that are overly battered, not subtly flash fried like some other great places. Ick. When I go here, I stick with the basic rolls, cali, scorpion, japanese bagel, etc. I don't so specialty rolls here after the fried ones I tried that weren't good. 

One thing that really ticked me off this past time was this new $2 \"service charge\" they're throwing on AFTER THEY SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD and without telling you on takeout orders. Wait what??? I don't tip on takeout, sorry. Putting my food in a bag straight from the chef who is salaried does not entitle you to a tip. That's ridiculous. I don't know who this charge goes to whether that be the sushi chefs or the bartenders bagging my food but get real. As little as $2 is and I don't care about it honestly, I won't miss $2 from my bank account, it's just dishonest SNEAKY business practices like this that erk me to the point where I'm not coming back. Let me explain how this went down, and this is a new thing they're doing BTW.

I went to pick up my order, I got 3 rolls, my total was like $19.50 or something. I checked over my receipt, that was the grand total after taxes. So, I handed over my credit card. When I was given the receipts for my signature, there was a \"Srv Chrg\" on it. See attached picture. So basically they charged me some fee, after my credit card was swiped, without telling me.

This should have been disclosed when I placed my order and ESPECIALLY before I paid for it. This is a principle thing to me, it's BS. If they would have said to me on the phone, \"Okay great, that'll be ready in 20 minutes and just so you know there is a $2 srv charg fee for xyz on takeout orders now.\" I would have been like, oh..okay whatever. But they said nothing, just tacked it on my bill without saying a word. That's just unacceptable. And no, it doesn't say anywhere on their online menu that there's a fee for takeout either. 

I tried to mark through the $2 charge and wrote my total as $19.50 and they still charged me the fee when I looked at my credit card statement. I may dispute the $2 to prove a point. I just really can't stand stuff like this. Biggest pet peeve ever, probably because I'm a super honest person and I despise dishonesty. 

For this reason, I will not be back. I'll find another mediocre sushi place to grab my takeout from. There are plenty. 

Pros: The manager or owner is very friendly and welcoming. Sorry to write this review guy, but you gotta know that what y'all are doing, isn't ethical."}
{"text":"Friday night wait was about 15min for a party of 2. The waiter was very helpful as we had never been here before. Had the angry spider and another sushi roll of 6, and chicken fried rice. Had to wait a long time for the rice  and the hostess wasn't that friendly, other than that, everything was great. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"DINNER REVIEW (not the buffet)

Honestly, I don't know how they do it. This is probably one of the most innovative sushi places I've been in America, and I LOVE sushi. You won't be ordering the California roll, spicy tuna, or other traditional rolls. Instead, they just do something way off the boat and completely different and have a dedicated menu full of random assortments of sushi. 

- Venue
I'm honestly sort of partial about the venue. Fairly loud, not high class, but not homey either. I just can't put my finger on it as it doesn't really have a theme. Maybe a good thing?

- Food/Sushi
Just a marvel. First of all: VERY WELL PRICED. Everything for the most part is under $10, which is pretty much unheard of for a good sushi restaurant. The sushi itself comes in a variety of different mixtures with a unique look for every different roll. Ru San's has it's own original sushi menu which lists well over 30 different rolls, most of which you may not have ever heard of. I tried a few:

New Moon Maki 10/10: Shrimp sushi with baked scallops on top was to die for. Literally had a bed of scallop that was cooked to perfection and to top it off it had eel sauce (which is my personal favorite). 

Pearl Harbor Shrimp Bomb Sushi 10/10: Not necessarily a roll per say, but a huge tempura contraption on top of a huge portion of rice and garlic sauce. Very big portions of tiger shrimp that went very well with the sauce. Pretty much a de-constructed sushi roll.

We had quite a lot of sushi, but those 2 were definitely my highlights. Overall, everything tasted delicious, looked fantastic, and came at good portions for an amazing price.

Would come back as often as possible. Great spot."}
{"text":"Great price for amazing sushi! If you like sashimi get it here, very fresh. As far speciality rolls: I would recommend the Tuna Bomb and yellowtail sangria. The Gone With the Wind roll was really fun and unique and if you like your sushi fried you will love it. The only thing I didn't like that I have ordered there is the Ramen bowl. Stick with the sushi. 

The service is good, they can get pretty busy and the busier it is the slower the service. Not slow enough to keep me from going, I am patient for good sushi."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place for sushi in Charlotte. We've been there a couple of times and are always pleased with our choices & recommendations from the servers. Everything is fresh and delicious. The range of pricing & portions are reasonable. 

Tiger Shrimp appetizer is a MUST to try if you like spicy food. I have not tried much else that has been cooked but look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.5 Stars for their Buffet

First off, a huge shout out to Gabriel N for taking me here! I remember coming here when I first arrived in Charlotte in 2011, but came at night. I thought the Sushi was good but nothing special.....

However, I remained a Ru San BUFFET virgin until Gabriel suggested we enjoy it together on a Friday. And I am SO glad we came here!

The selection of different Sushi's was really wide, and they had a surprising selection of \"hot\" entrees like fried rice and noodles which were very good.

But unquestionably the star was the Sushi. And I partook in almost all of them! My only \"complaint\" was that they were NOT labeled....I would HIGHLY recommend that Management do that so you know what you're eating! Thankfully I liked just about all of it, some more than others.

Then Gabriels orders 2 speciality dishes...the first being a Shrimp Tempura and the other a Fried whole clove of garlic roll. WOW was that ever good! But you better love garlic....and I certainly do!

And of course, they have some really good hot saki for a reasonable price.

Overall this really is a great value and the quality surprisingly good for a BUFFET. It has a definite \"Hipster\" vibe to it and is a lot of fun! Definitely on the recommended list! And thanks Gabriel for sharing this great place with me!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, almost overwhelming in it's selection.  The atmosphere is busy and friendly, not quiet, in a attractive setting with a full bar.  My son and I went on Saturday night, around nine and had to wait about half an hour, helped along with $2.50 beers on the nice patio they have.  On the advice of another helper, we ordered the wok-fried tiger shrimp appetizer plus a couple of orders of yakitori.  The shrimp was amazing, spicy with cool slices of avocado and little rice cups to scoop it all up.  The yakitori was nothing special and too sweet for my taste.  We ordered a LARGE variety of sushi and maki - the angry spider roll stood out - fried soft shell crab with avocado and topped with spicy crab (krab?).  All of the sushi ($1-$2 ea) was fantastic and comes by the piece which is nice for a larger variety.  They also have half makis for about $2-$3 for 3 pieces.  The smoked salmon sushi stood out.  We also had a roll made with fried oysters and spinach which was amazing and a sweet scallop with chili roll which was great.  Our server was great and very attentive.  This is a special place, bill for everything was $47 - wow.  The only suggestion I would have is to supply diners with paper and pencil to organize your order before the server takes it.  My son wrote our order out on his phone and the waiter copied it from the phone.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am going to preface this by admitting, I have never been to Ru San's for anything but the Saturday $10 lunch buffet.  That being said, it's one good buffet! The sushi is pretty good for buffet and the other food on the buffet is pretty good, too. I am not going to say it's the best sushi I ever had, because obviously, at $10-- why would it be?  But it's is one heck of a deal for pretty good all-you-can-eat sushi that doesn't make you sick afterward."}
{"text":"I have spent my past 3 visits here telling myself  \"Meh, its just an off day\". After my last trip, im just done. Done and done. Yea, at one point it was good but that was years ago(like, before they expanded). Now its crap food with crap service. On my last visit the waiter dropped sushi in my lap, when it was finally replaced it was awful and then we had to wait 25 minutes for the check(and no, it wasn't very busy).  Ru Sans i am so over you and i will have a hard time trusting food advice from anyone that isn't."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Huge menu that speaks to EVERYONE! Vegetarians, sushi newbies, sushi experts! We go here once a week and have never had bad service or bad sushi. If you go on Friday or Saturday, be prepared for a wait. The wait is worth it every time though! Love Ru Sans!"}
{"text":"Ru Sans is sushi as good as anywhere - save for Sushi Yasuda in NYC.

The seafood here is top quality. We've enjoyed fresh Sea Urchin, Squid, Conch & Sea Eel. The high volume of product that moves through this place ensures freshness. There's a daily lunch buffet, and no doubt it helps, too. (but I've never been.)
 
They are DEEP FRY / TEMPURA masters at Ru Sans.  Try anything fried - it will be GREAT!

Sit at the bar if you'd like an amuse bouche of cucumber salad.

BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN HERE? Hamachi Kama, or grilled Yellow Tail Cheek. If you LOVE salt water fish - try it!!! It's found in the appetizer section of their menu, is big enough to almost make a meal of... and for less than $8 - what a bargain! ***Cheek cuts are prized among fish mongers - who usually save for themselves.

Don't be afraid to ask the sushi chefs about what is freshest or especially good... they're nice guys.
Note: If the cooks make a ruckuss & \"holla\" when you walk in or when your leaving, it's a good thing... your either a nice looking lady or a good customer. Don't be offended - it's their thing to do here.

THE WORST PART OF RU SANS is the service... it can be slow or spotty. This is the why they only get 4 stars. But, my wife & I are regulars & still get poor service sometimes - so don't take it personally.

Enjoy the yumminess!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is great and the price is right on point!  I had a wonderful dish with salmon perfectly cooked and yummy rice,eggplant and wonderfully cooked vegetables. The portion of this dish would easily feed 3 people.  Everyone at my table had a delicious entire. I will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet was a great deal! Kind of a college/ trendy atmosphere with lots of energy. Service was good and we were welll atended to. 
Buffet tables were well stocked with large selection and new rolls I had never tried before.

Recommend... for lunch, but reserving opinion for dinnertime"}
{"text":"If they had an option for zero stars, they would have it. We placed an order for pickup an hour ago. My husband is still at the bar waiting on the order that they keep messing up. Chicken yakisoba noodles. Is it really that complicated? They've brought him shrimp asking if that's acceptable. My son has a shellfish allergy, so no. He's asked to speak to a manager, hasn't see one yet. Absolutely unacceptable service or lack thereof."}
{"text":"So I went to last night and thought I should try something different, I asked my server, Kristina, what was a good appetizer and she suggested the hot wok tiger shrimp. When the plate came I could already tell it was spicy just by the view, I took a bite and it was heaven! The shrimp was juicy, the sauce was spicy, and the onions and avocado gave it a fresh clean taste. I loved it! If you like spicy shrimp this is definitely worth a try! 
SN: I love the atmosphere and servers there, definitely one of my favorite places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"When trekking out of the NoDa area for a initial potentially romantic encounter to the Dilworth area, Ru San's is the spot for inexpensive sushi in a fun atmosphere.  

The special rolls are always interesting and usually tasty for the safe and daring  sushi eater alike.  I had the seven samurai last night that tested my chopstick dexterity with a sticky rice wrap, but it was satisfying when I finally got it into my grill.

They have some beer (guh, Budweiser) specials that weren't bad, but I stick with wine by the bottle.  A LITTLE lofty on the pricing that way, but it is standard for restaurant mark up.

Note: fun atmosphere can quickly translate into \"am I old, or is it loud in here?!\" when someone does a saki bomb and the chefs all bang on the stainless steel counters.

All in all, an old stand by for a cheap sushi first date."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever enjoyed. Although the wait for s table on Saturday night was close to half an hour and akin to waiting to get into a club, the impressive menu, super friendly staff, and phenomenal food was well worth the wait. The sake selection is impressive, as are Ru San's specialty rolls. For those who enjoy nigiri, an equally impressive selection is available, at a reasonable price, and is very high quality. Pricing is actually less expensive than many \"wannabe\" sushi places. I'd give Ru San's five stars if they could work out their wait list and waiting area issues."}
{"text":"I think we have found our new favorite sushi spot, but I am afraid everyone in Charlotte already knew about this amazing place! There are plenty of seating options along the bar, booths, and tables. We opted for the bar as we like to watch them make the rolls. On one side of the bar  there are TVs in a two spots which is an added bonus. The atmosphere is lively and fast paced and I absolutely love their shirts, \"Why SOY Serious.\" 

Now for the important part..... the food! When you sit down you receive a little sample of cucumber and crab in a special sauce. I ordered the seaweed salad which was delicious. Service is quick and presentation is excellent. For our rolls we ordered the Fire Cracker, Rich & Famous, La La Land, and Ultimate Tuna. They were all absolutely awesome!!!! Our favorite was Ultimate Tuna and La La Land. 

You cannot beat the taste or the price. We cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ru sans turned out to be a chain that exists in a few cities around the country. It's not great but it's not bad either. 

There are a number of creative sushi rolls that exist on the menu and have a decent selection of vegan/vegetarian options as well. 

We have been here a few times which just shows that the food is good but don't expect it to blow your socks off. If you're looking for a place that serves tasty sushi, has a fun environment this is a good place to check out. But service at times has been slow."}
{"text":"Having been here for the $10 lunch buffet and dinner the impression I got was it's just okay. There's so many reviews on this place already I'm not sure what to write about that hasn't been said before. The parking here is nice and large, which is good since it can get super crowded. Inside you might have to wait a while for a table on busy dinner nights, but lunch is pretty fast seating.

The lunch buffet is satisfying and cheap. Since this is so close to where I work a lot of us end up here for a quick sushi fix. They seem to change around a few menu items every day for lunch so you won't be too bored if you come often.

The dinner rush is a totally different atmosphere than the daytime. Walked in to booming music, chefs and waiters cheering on sake bombs, pounding on tables, and people trying to be loud enough to have a conversation at their tables. I guess I've gotten old because it wasn't very appealing to me, I prefer sushi in a more toned down environment. The rolls themselves were cheap and some flavor combinations turned out pretty good. There seems to be a lot of fried rolls drenched in mayo and sriracha though. The food seemed to come out in a timely manner even though the place was crowded that night, and we even got some free rolls and dessert!

Well this place's sushi isn't the best but it's convenient for me and cheap. The service is friendly and fast so when I just need a quick bite I think I'll head to Ru San's, but for a nice night out I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Enjoyable. The wait was shorter than we were told. Extensive menu. A ton of choices. Would go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday. Sushi was excellent, the food prep area was extremely clean and they were well staffed. We ordered the Krystal Rainbow Roll (which I liked because it is made without Octopus), Garden Lavash Roll (wrapped in rice paper and comes in 4 pieces), Salmon Maki and the Exotic Roll which has mango inside and a chili aioli. Everything was delicious! The prices were extremely reasonable and the service was decent. They do not serve saki or beer which was disappointing. Regardless, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service, my order came out 45 minutes after everyone else I went with. And my check came out with gratuity already included after I had complained several times about how long my food took to get out."}
{"text":"I love the buffet here.

This place is really loud and a sensory overload so its not a good place to go and chat.  It is a place to strap on your feedback and go crazy on some sushi.

They have both cold and hot custom rolls on the buffet.

I personally focus on the nigiri style salmon, tuna, and when they put it out the yellowtail.  Watch out because people hover and grab the good stuff and you have to wait for more of it to come out.

I have put a plat or two full of rice out for collection and nobody complained about it.  I usually double stack the fish from two nigiri style sushi pieces.

If you aren't ordering the buffet I can't stress how much I love the conch: it comes on a bed of crispy vinegar soaked spinach.  It is like salt and vinegar crisps except no potatoes - just warm semi soft spinach.

You can end up spending a ton of money if you order off the menu.  Back in the day I used to come here every week for the energizer lunch but they have since changed it (no more $8 for more hand-rolls than I could ever finish)."}
{"text":"As a young sushi eater i fell in love with Ru San's.  There is a lot to love about this place-  they have a huge and creative menu, they have a large selection of dollar rolls, and they have a high energy staff that is entertaining.  However, as the years have passed I have fallen out of love with Ru San's.  The main problem I have with this place is that their health code rating has fallen (more than once) into the 70s and that is just gross.  One time they were reportedly docked points because food had been picked-up off the floor and then served.  I have also been there before and seen that they weren't refridgerating all of the fish (I'm talking stacks of crab sticks just sitting out  on a table, and they weren't about to be used).  If this doesn't dissuade you, my friends have gotten sick several times after eating at the Nashville location.

EDIT:  They have recently remodeled and I was quite impressed with the lunch buffet.  I checked and the health code rating was above a 95."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Ru Sans. When in Charlotte, I eat here often.  The wait staff is terrific, helpful, etc.  The atmosphere is very energetic.  They sometimes get a little carried away with the sauces, but it is still always tastey, and very well priced."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11:45 am on a Tuesday. One person . Empty restaurant. Asked for a booth or table and was told I could only get seating at the bar because the lunch rush was coming. I said I didn't want to sit at the bar. Even though it was empty I was told that was the only seating available for solo patrons. So I left."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so famous. I eat sushi almost every week, but this place has the worst quality of sushi. I had to pick off every piece of sushi. Also, crispy sushi was too greasy. Please eat good quality of sushi for your health."}
{"text":"Do not ever come here. Waiting hour for simple to go order.  No sympathy. No respect.   Horrible service."}
{"text":"RuSan's have the best and freshest sushi in town!!!! This place is always busy- and most of the time there is a wait on the weekends! The staff here are friendly :) stop by and order the 'rich and famous' & 'three kingdom' sushi roll (my favorite)"}
{"text":"Felt like sushi, but wasn't dressed up enough for one of the swanky joints. This place was perfect. We ordered 5 vegetarian rolls and paid around $17. i thoroughly enjoyed all of them except for the peanut roll. The peanut roll was really just peanuts in a roll. i thought maybe it would have some peanuts with something else, but no, just peanuts. Everything else was delicious: avocado, teriyaki zucchini, coconut tofu, and something else. i do put a little Sriracha sauce on everything, so maybe i just like the taste of that and could eat just about anything. Either way, i thought it was very good, very affordable, and plan to go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Ru San's but tell me what there is an extra charge on my bill now.  Check your receipt large party or not you'll have a sur charge.  We had a party of 5 and each of us had a sur charge. Even take out has a Sur charge!"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet. now granted, I know that the quality is most likely a lot different than the dinner plates (i hope). If I wasn't so hungry, I would have walked out after the first plate. Everything tasted mushy and all the same. Little to no flavor and nothing was labelled, so you had no idea what you were eating, even though all the rolls tasted about the same. There were some tempura items, but again, with the batter, you had no idea what is was since there were no labels. Only labels said: \"Out at 11am, Take away by 3pm\". Eww, let's hope it hasn't been sitting out since 11! Some tasted old, some tasted fresher. Nothing tasted especially good at all. I will never waste another dollar on the buffet here, but might give them a chance on dinner ala carte sushi. I hear good things about the sushi here, but I just did not get anything good. I wouldn't rate anything I got over a 4-5, on a scale of 1-10. Wish I had just skipped this place. $11 for that buffet food was a rip-off. 
As far as the service, I had a server ask me if I wanted something to drink when I got there, then I had to chase someone down to get a check. I had to ask 2 other servers, and still nobody came. Finally, I got lucky and saw mine walk by. Blows my mind how this place can be so popular and busy. Let's hope dinner is better. I am definitely not a food snob, and I can appreciate good food in a crappy hole in the wall spot, as long as the food tastes good. Im not even scared of sanitation scores. But the buffet food here was virtually inedible."}
{"text":"This place is great, but it needs a couple of extra servers to really be amazing.  The sushi is excellent quality, however it sometimes takes a few minutes to get to the table.  But there is a reason it's always crowded, everyone loves this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always fresh (all the dishes are marked with the time they come out onto the sushi bar), delicious and varied. The service is friendly and attentive and the crowd is diverse and appreciative. Very much worth the price. And, they feature the sushi bar (plus soup, salad and hot foods) 6 times a week, lunch only, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but we must go to Ru San's 2-3 times a month. It's essentially the only sushi place we'll go to in Charlotte anymore. It's not high end, but it's great for what you pay for. There's a very casual atmosphere inside their huge Dilworth restaurant with plenty of booth, table, and bar seating. They're almost always busy but the turnover is pretty quick so you shouldn't have to wait all that long. The staff are very kind and attentive, always checking in to be sure you have what you need. The atmosphere is lively and kind of loud, but exactly as you'd expect for this sort of restaurant. 

They have a very expansive menu with everything from your usual appetizers, a plethora a regular and special sushi rolls, nigiri, ramen, noodle dishes, and beyond. They have the more traditional Japanese beers and sake along with a good selection of local craft beers on tap and in bottles/cans. 

We always order three rolls that aren't actually on the menu anymore, but used to be on their specials. They're more than happy to continue making them for us. The miso soup and appetizers come out quickly and the main courses follow at just the right time. They have more basic rolls, healthier rolls, or gigantic deep fried rolls, depending on what you're looking for. I have yet to have anything that I didn't like. I do want to try their ramen, fried rice, and yakisoba at some point, but I always end up getting the same thing time after time. 

They need to replicate this same restaurant in North Charlotte!"}
{"text":"When we need our sushi fix, this is our favorite spot.  There are a lot of good sushi places across the city and most of them are either a bit pricey for what you get or reasonable but with limited options.  Ru San's satisfies both: reasonably priced and lots of choices.

It's located in a strip mall with a couple other restaurants and a wine shop.  It's a bit tucked away back there but it makes for easier parking!

The service is a little hit or miss, particularly if it's busy (as it usually is on the weekends, so plan accordingly).  That said, I don't mind waiting a little longer when it comes to sushi because of the work that goes into putting it together.  Also, the water dude is on point!  I swear to god, that guy is at the ready every time I take a gulp of my water to fill that thing right back up.  Much appreciated given that I tend to go with the spicier options.

All in all, great spot for reasonably priced sushi and a good time!"}
{"text":"I had been here once about three years ago, but didn't remember much. I went again for a late Saturday night date night with my boyfriend. It was pretty busy, so we were sat at the bar. We thought it would be unpleasant to sit at, but it was awesome seeing the chefs work and there was tv in sight too! 

At the bar seat, you can see all the fish that the chefs are working with and it's awesome. I ordered a rainbow roll and he order some chicken udon noodle soup. My rainbow roll was personally handed to me by the chef that made it, which was awesome. Later, my boyfriend and I split the tootsie roll! It was delicious and the eel sauce was awesome. 

This is a great place to have a date or just a nice sushi meal to yourself. The goldfish neon lighting above the bar gives it a good aesthetic. Definitely coming back for my new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Good sushi but not impressed that they tack on a 10% 'service charge' for picking up food!  Last time I  order take out from Ru'Sans!! No other sushi place in town does that to pick up your own food. Plus, they didn't charge me that less than a month ago!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Charlotte! Love the sushi and experience. There is a LARGE menu with something for everyone. It is a busy place, so if you go on the weekend you just have to be patient it is well worth any 30 minute wait as stated in previous reviews. I have been going here for 10 years and have never had a bad roll. My favorite is the sesame tuna roll. Every server I have had has been very nice!"}
{"text":"We got the Tarzan roll, Sassy Woman, Mango de Tango, and Honey (all from the Special Roll menu). Everything was delicious! The presentation was great as well. The service was good, with everything coming out rather quickly. We've eaten here before and will be back again."}
{"text":"Never been for lunch, but dinner has always been awesome!! Be prepared for a wait to get seated but there is a space at the bar you can sit at that not a lot of people know about.  Ask for a saki bomb and have a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, love the appetizers. I ordered yakiudon pan fried noodles last night and they were drenched with way too much sauce, I did not find it edible at all. The sauce was very strong, tasted like pure soy sauce, not diluted at all and just did not taste good. Even when I don't like dishes I usually eat it anyway so for me to send something back to the kitchen it has to be REALLY bad, I believe this is the first time I've sent something back anywhere. The waiter gave me a really hard time about sending the dish back, he kept insisting that I wanted a spicy dish, I kept telling him that I like spicy food and that was not the problem. Ugh eventually he talked to the owner (so he claims) and took the dish back. Then he brought the check and for some reason combined me and my friend's check, when I asked him to separate it he made a rude comment about me having to only pay for the miso soup I ordered. I still left him a 20% tip even though I shouldn't have, he would have gotten an even nicer tip if he had just taken the noodles back and showed good hospitality."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about coming to this establishment because of the overwhelming bad reviews in regards to their customer service. I went during lunch time and was seated at the bar. Five minutes went before a waitress noticed I wasn't being helped.. She apologized and quickly brought me a glass of water and a menu. She returned two minutes later and asked if I was ready to make an order, which I was.

I ordered the following:

Teriyaki Rice Ball - This rice ball is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It is covered in a teriyaki glaze. It is served hot and is good.

Sea Bass Yakitori - Delectable and melts in your mouth! Be sure to order it (salt only, no sauce).

Nigiri Ikura - Amazing 

Nigiri Unagi - Tasty

Nigiri Saba - They gave me a piece that was not presentable and tried to cover it up with some green onion. Regardless, it was delicious!

Calamari Tempura Roll - Calamari is hard to get right and this was spot on! Fried well, was soft, and tasty. If the calamari or octopus at a restaurant is tough and chewy.. they do not know what they are doing !

Grinch Roll - Delicious! Would order again!

Both rolls had an issue with keeping their form; it seemed that the rice was a tad over cooked and was not rolled tightly enough.

The food started to arrive within five minutes! Once I was done eating, I asked for the check and received my check and a complementary piece of cake within two minutes.

The sushi is great, the service was good, and the prices are fair; I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"What a great Sashimi place. Lots of traffic usually means a good business. To-go orders and dining in. People waiting outside on a Sunday evening.

I ordered the signature Sashimi Napoleon and was a little unclear on how the fried wonton was combined. They use it like a chalupa tortilla to stack the sashimi. Wonton, four thin slices of sashimi, wonton, four more slices, and so on. Great combination. I like a little crunchy with my sashimi and the fried wonton stayed crispy down to the last bite.

I could have made a meal of of the bacon-wrapped scallop yakatori appetizers. Mmmmm!

I didn't try any sushi but I was sitting at the bar watching them prepare them and their rolls looked great too. The chefs really packed them tight and all of the ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Best all-you-can-eat sushi buffet in Charlotte... Period... Great selection, decent price... Be sure to go for dinner and order off the EXTENSIVE menu.... Seriously, be willing to spend a little time considering ALL the choices and ask your server for suggestions.. You will love it"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! Best sushi in Charlotte for sure. No one else compares to the range of options with rolls"}
{"text":"I'll start off by prefacing this review by stating that we went for the buffet, and perhaps the made-to-order food is better. That being said, if you're a restaurant and you're offering food to customers, it should be good, regardless. 

To keep it short: Sushi was disproportionately rice-heavy, the rice was sort of mushy, and the ingredients didn't taste fresh either. This definitely isn't my first \"low-quality, high quantity\" sushi buffet, but this was the worst I've ever had. 

Having just moved to Charlotte and left behind all of my favorite restaurants, I was excited to go to the \"best\" sushi spot in Charlotte. We left unsatisfied and sort of grossed out, though, and have not given them a second chance, as the first was bad enough."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written about the greatness of this place yet!

I love sushi, I remember a time when I thought raw fish was the worst thing on earth but now I embrace it and can't get enough.  I have been here for a normal meal and the sushi is always fresh and very reasonable.  But you MUST go for the lunch buffet!

Here's the deal:  Everyday at lunch from 11am to 2pm I think there is an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi buffet.  They are making it fresh all the time and keep bringing out plates and plates of it for you to devour.  Also included is a small buffet of hot asian foods like egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice, calamari and some other items.  There's also dessert.  All this for....$10!  

I know what you're thinking, the sushi has to be bad, the fish is old, I'm gonna get sick!  But no, it's fresh, and delicious and many times on Saturday afternoon after a rough Friday night I've found myself there with my husband eating WAY too much and heading home for a nap.

Try it out, I doubt you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty great, but if you're looking for your classic Sushi options, you won't find them here!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and really energetic vibe. Went here on a Sunday night and it was still busy but worth the short wait. The Tuna Bomb was incredible and the sauces and spicy mayo made the options endless. The menu is huge so don't worry if there are some in your party that don't like it raw. They'll have plenty of options. They have very cool high top tables in the back that seat 8 and make this place perfect for big parties. My new favorite place in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"We met up with some friends here for dinner at 6:30 on a Wednesday night.
It was pretty busy for a week night. 

Atmosphere - Club music, clean tables, dirty bathroom, decent Japanese decor. 

Service - Nice servers, always had filled waters, cleared off trash/plates quickly. 

Food - Our friends think the sushi is pretty great. 
I had the Rainbow roll and another colorful roll. I sadly was not impressed, I could taste the fish was not very fresh. My fianc√© had the teriyaki chicken, she wasn't a fan of the chicken or veggies. We won't return, but our friends love the place."}
{"text":"I had my last RuSan's experience last night. I've eaten there before, and it's been tolerable -- that is to say, loud, but with decent cheap sushi, and good Japanese-style soups and entrees, prepared and served, ironically enough, completely by people of Hispanic descent.

My wife and I ate there last night. She ordered sushi, I had soup. Her sushi arrived about 15 minutes after ordering. She started eating and we waited for my food. (Not a big deal, she eats slowly anyway.) So I waited. And waited. And waited. My wife finished her food, and just about as she ate the last bite, the soup arrived. About 40 minutes after her food. Nearly an hour after ordering. No explanation was offered for the delay, and the place was not busy.

I'll be going somewhere else from now on. Inability to have the entrees come out within 5 minutes of each other is just inexcusable. Especially sushi. Were they afraid it was going to get cold?"}
{"text":"Too busy to focus on excellent customer service? Or is it because I'm a single sitting at the sushi bar that I'm not as important or profitable of the table of four? Tonight was the final straw for Ru Sans. My server was so neglectful and rude, the whole experience was ruined. I literally had to get up and go to the bar to get my bill because I only had seen my server once the whole time and I literally couldn't find him.  Did I want another soda? Did I want another sushi roll? Did I want dessert? Shame on you Ru Sans. After many years of coming here, I'm done."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food was okay, the fried rice was good but tasted a little burnt and my sushi roll had way too much cream cheese. I would go back and try some other things but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"What an Experience or maybe an Nightmare!!! The way that I pick the restaurants to eat at is through Yelp. The way that my husband pick the restaurants is through word for mouth.  Both could be beneficial, but I was not too thrilled to go check this place out, and boy was I right. I finally gave in to my hubby because people told him that this is the best Sushi Buffet in Charlotte, (he needs to really stop listening to those people LOL). 

The place was jam pack with people who I guess enjoys it, but it was not worth the $25.00 that we paid. This was for two $9.95 adult buffet and three sodas. Yes three sodas for two people, because you don't get free refills since the soda comes in a can. So anytime you want more to drink, you have to order another can of soda (which they don't tell you). 

Anyway the place was dirty looking and the buffet setup was in the dark aisle between the bar and other patrons booths. And boy was it a mess. The handles of the tongs were setting on the food and which made it sticky, not enough tongs for each item, so you have to use the same tongs for 3 different items and the food was just thrown on the plate like slop thrown in the trough for pigs. The sushi rolls were not label, so therefore you didn't know what you were eating and if you were allergic to something in the roll that was not seen you was SOL. The calamari tasted as if it was cooked in the same grease as the fried chicken. I guess their play on Chicken calamari! 

Best thing on the menu to me which I got three plates of was the....... SALAD and ginger dressing. Best thing on the menu for my husband was...... the Coke in the Can!!!! He hated everything. The most disgusting buffet I have seen. 

By the time the bill came, my hubby wanted to walk out, because he did not eat anything!!!! But the two cans of Coke. But we paid our bill and vowed to each other never to come here again!!!

P.S. The servers yell across the restaurant to alert the hostess that people are coming into the restaurant!!! So ignoring, especially since we were sitting at the booth right by the door!!!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review, and its important to note the food hasn't changed since my prior thoughts (see below). What is important is that the service has been drastically improved over the last few months - the phone seems to be attended better (although certainly not high tech), the orders are ready when promised, and they have even helped me through the ordering process on occasion. Its great to see positive change, and I appreciate the apparent effort to make my (still 100% takeout) experience better. Kudos, folks 

My new arbitrary food score: 3.5. It doesn't suck, and I can eat a ton of it
Experience score: 3. I still dislike the \"convenience fee\", the website is still really hard to navigate, and the phone still goes to \"fax\" from time to time...but I no longer dread stopping here and the folks have been very nice lately!

**Prior 2-Star Post: So the food here is fine. My experience is entirely take-out, as I have no interest in the crowds this place generates. The sushi is generally fresh, and has that \"fishy\" taste only 10-15% of the time. To be clear, this is American Sushi - fried rolls, lots of mayo, etc - and I'm a fan in general of this approach. It is NOT where I go when I want to have anything close to high quality sushi. Regardless, we eat here quite a bit as it is on my way home from work.

The main issue is the restaurant could really care less if they have my business (or anyone else's for that matter). Their phone system is antiquated (it typically takes 4-6 calls to get through, with some going to a \"full\" voicemail, others simply hanging up, and others going directly to a fax line. Their website is indecipherable, but if you do a google search you can find some alternative hidden pages with actual food listed on it - the main page includes nothing that would assist a phone customer with placing an order.

Once in the restaurant, Ru Sans staff treat people in the restaurant as inconvenient roadblock to the staff getting through the night. I'm pretty sure this used to be a cool schtick they employed intentionally and with vigor, but now they just seem bored and detached. I have yet to be treated as anything close to a \"customer\" in this restaurant. Its like the owners know they will have business whether they treat people well or not, so they go out of their way to AVOID doing anything that would make the experience better.

My arbitrary food score: 3.5. It doesn't suck, and I can eat a ton of it
Experience score: 1. It actually does suck.

Also, they tack a 10% convenience fee on takeout orders. Even when they take twice as long as they quote to prepare the order. This is not something they advertise or mention prior to pickup, and is - in my opinion - silly since I would never tip less than 10% to anyone providing decent service. Oh, wait...now I get it."}
{"text":"This has to be hand's, feet, toes, and whatever other body part you want to use to describe how amazingly AWESOME this place is. I have been doing some major grindage at this establishment since 2004. I have always had an enjoyable experience and meal every time:)

The saki is always a necessity and well with that comes the beer! 

This is a place that even the \"I don't like sushi\" type can go to and not complain that there is nothing on the menu to eat. Very nice non-sushi selection.
For the sushi lovers and the courageous foodies........NOM NOM's galore. The selection and price are just to \"YAY\" about and for the times you are so sushi craved the all you can or care to eat lunch buffet ($10.10) is the OMG. I can sit from 11:30am-2:30pm and never eat the same piece twice or thrice unless I want to. They keep the rolls a flowing and change the types every time a new plate goes out. Also get a whole hot bar section as well with calamari, chicken wings, salads, soup, Chinese selections, and dessert. 

Great for the intimate date, party group, or even the solo diner. You are always welcomed with a yell by the whole crew:)

Love the NOMMMA-CHAN!!!

{"text":"As a starving artist I am dedicating this review to the Ru San's lunch buffet!  I will often skip dinner, and breakfast in preparation for this glorious buffet.  For around $10 you can FILL UP on all you can eat sushi rolls.  You also have the option to have hot food, salad and soup.  I often arrive right at 11:30 opening to miss the line that forms at the door.  The line moves fast and I take it as a positive sign that I am not the only one obsessed with a sushi lunch buffet.  The selection of sushi is good if you like small, more common rolls.  If you are looking for the fancy \"American\" sushi then you will need to order off the menu.  How can we convince them to carry this buffet through dinner?  I would be there every night!"}
{"text":"Who knew North Carolina could have awesome sushi??

The white tuna here is really FRESH!  My friends & I got a plate full of it... literally.

We also got what looked like a tuna martini (forgot the actual name of it) and it had 3-4 types of tuna on skewers in a big martini glass. Very nice!  Two of my favorites were seared tuna & sesame encrusted tuna.

I also ate this sushi with three eggs: quail, tobiko & tamago.  I wanted to spit it out.

I don't think this place is meant to be super fancy; it was a hole-in-the-wall feel but it's still pretty good for it's price."}
{"text":"Ru Sans never disappoints. Every time we have an opportunity to drive up 77 for the sushi buffet we take it. There is always a wonderful variety of sushi rolls that can satisfy any taste. There is also a great selection of shashimi.  For the folks who do not like sushi RuSans offers a hot bar filled with miso soup, egg rolls, fried rice etc.  if you're within 60 miles of this restaurant I promise it is worth the gas. The buffet is $11.99."}
{"text":"Anything better than a sushi buffet? This place is awesome! I definitely can't get enough of it! Lots of my favorite rolls and sashimi too. Restaurant is very clean and got nice decorating. Costumers are most of office people at lunch time. They open at 11am. Me and my friends were waiting 20mins outside when we came first time. By the way the open, just a lot people come from no where all come in same time and restaurant get crowded quickly. Buffers absolutely satisfied our tummies! Yummy! I love octopus sushi and sashimi. And prices are not expensive at all ! Just $13 for each, I got surprised so much because each time I go to sushi bar, it often cost me about $25 for each person. But their sushi are great! Not bad at all ! I definitely will come back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Whether you're trying sushi for the first time, or you've got a passion, this place satisfies all of the above. Complex, fun, raw fish rolls, Cali rolls and a small Buffett of hot food and soup. Great place for a lunch date and definitely a place I will return, time and time again. They have a lot of local beers too!!! Woo!"}
{"text":"Ru San's has a lively ambience. Our waitress was very attentive and quick. My coworker and I dined here without prior research and we realized after we got our food why they call themselves 'innovative sushi'.

Half of the soft shell crab appetizer were fried vegetable chunks that shape like crabs. One of the sushi roll served was fried. Plum saki tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup.

If you enjoy fried dishes inspired by Japanese cuisine in large portions, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Has great sushi and a lot of options for non sushi eaters!  My favorite roll is Kiss of Fire.  Good appetizer is the Hawaiian poke.  The ginger salad dressing is the best in town!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the spot to go for sushi in Charlotte!!! There is none better and let me tell you the saki bombs are the business!! I would eat a fart to get to eat here just saying!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in charlotte. Fresh food & great presentation. The flavored saki is great too"}
{"text":"Love this place. My company comes here a lot for lunch. The sushi buffet I heard it's great although I've never had it but my coworkers love it. Are usually order the green turtle which is super tasty."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte, we've been trying to find a regular sushi restaurant. Since we've been to Ru Sans, we can't bring ourselves to go anywhere else. Amazing sushi and good service. They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. It's always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Sssssuuuuussshhhhi! All I can say is YUM! I was pleasantly surprised to find this sushi bar in Charlotte before heading to a concert that is in the area. My mom and I went to Ru San's around dinner time (6ish) on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy for a week night. There is nice outdoor seating along with indoor seating and great sushi bar seating. The employees were very friendly and were very helpful when I had any questions about the menu. I ordered a garden salad for my appetizer and my mom ordered the Sea Breeze app. I believe her's was saut√©ed conch meat and spinach. Whatever it was, she loved it! My salad was a nice start to our main entrees. Together we split the chirashi bowl, the rainbow roll, and the firecracker roll. The chirashi bowl was by far my favorite. The sashimi was insanely fresh and I was surprised to find a couple pieces of sweet tofu. Ahhh, and the hype is true! The firecracker roll is DELICIOUS. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and order it ASAP. Lastly, the rainbow roll, a favorite of mine, was very tasty. Nothing special, but very enjoyable. I really enjoyed my experience at Ru San's and I can't wait to make another trip to Charlotte so that I can have another delicious chirashi bowl! They have a huge variety of speciality rolls so I am also interested in trying some of those. My only compliant about Ru San's was that it did not seem like a very professional restaurant. Some of the employees were joking around and talking to each other across tables. Not that that is a huge problem, however, the quality of food was so high that I expected better from the staff. With that being said, I still highly recommend visiting this establishment!"}
{"text":"Tasty fresh sushi!

Cheap Sake!

Part of the Regional Chain the southeast...not the best sushi, not the best sake, but it balances price/value and all locations play good dance music later in the night...some with DJ....also know for a really cheap like under $10 AYCE lunch buffet in most locations....

Staple of any travel diet or el cheapo loco local...oops, did I call myself out?"}
{"text":"If you're looking to dine in a high-energy environment, go to Ru San's, where the chefs are often yelling and greeting you when you walk in. Ru San's has good sushi and Japanese food. Plus, it's pretty affordable. I'm not a sushi fan, so I tend to get vegetable tempura or teriyaki chicken, both of which are delicious at Ru San's. My sushi-loving friends love the place too."}
{"text":"Visited Ru San's for the first time on Friday evening.  I called ahead to set up a table for 8 people.  We had fantastic service from Eric.  We ordered the yakitori as an appetizer:  Conch, Sea Bass, Mushrooms.  The yakitori was covered in too much sauce and didn't taste grilled like the kind we ate in Japan.  Next, we ordered the Super Protein Sushi Platter to split.  It was a great value and delicious.  The Saketinis were tasty, but not very strong.  I enjoyed my experience there and look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Ru San's is my default, dependable sushi spot in town. Their prices are good and the quality is consistent. I like their power builder plates. It's easily enough for two people to share. Ru San's won't knock your socks off but you'll leave happy every time. Avoid coming during peak times because the wait can get scary long."}
{"text":"We came here last weekend and this place was great. They don't take reservations but even after seeing the long line we were still able to sit within a reasonable time frame. The staff were really good and helpful when it came to ordering our food too. Once we got our food, it was amazing. My favorite was the Twice Cooked Smoked Salmon Maki rolls. The sauce on top did it for me. 

Overall, it a great place for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi! I mean it was so fresh and good I can't wait to go back! Downside you have to wait until your entire party is there to be seated but that's fine because it's not the biggest restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Huge menu with plenty of options even things for people who don't care for sushi. The food was very nicely plated and a nice sociable atmosphere. I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Ru San's for many years now, and it's always a good time. The service is usually pleasant, and quick. And the sushi and rolls are always very delicious. Nothing fancy. Consistently good. Shout out to Dee who was our delightful waitress last night."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of some Ru San's. Unfortunately at least most of the time the service is horrible. There are 2 waiters that are just awful. They are slow, they never refill your glass...its just bad. 

The food on the other hand is great! I love their $1.50 sushi. It has a fun atmosphere and room for larger parties in the back. But if you do have a large party.. sometimes it may mean you'll be waiting for an hour for food. At least thats my experience with 2 birthday celebrations there. 

If the service was quicker I'd give this place five stars, but that poor service kills it."}
{"text":"Very good lunch buffet!  Price seems to have gone up lately which may push it out of my frequency.....Kenneth.....wish they would put names on the buffet so you know what you are eating.....or maybe we don't want to know what you're eating....I would recommend!"}
{"text":"This sushi place had so many options. With over eight pages of options, you can get whatever you wish for. The place was so so crowded, but the service was incredible. Our food came out so quickly and our waiter was so kind despite the busyness. I really enjoyed this place because of the affordability, ambience, and amazing sushi variety!!"}
{"text":"Probably the most overrated restaurant in Charlotte.  I give them two stars only b/c of their lunch buffet.  If you are looking to put down an embarrassing amount of mediocre mystery fish rolls- then this buffet is for you.  However, I have never left after the buffet without regretting the decision to eat there in the first place.  The regular menu is huge and has a great variety; but the quality is just not there and to me a lot of bad items does not equal a good meal.  So many other Sushi/Asian restaurants in the area- I would recommend skipping this one."}
{"text":"First visit; came for lunch.  First thing I noticed was the strong scent of industrial cleaner masking fish odor.  I grabbed a plate for the buffet.  None of the items were labeled, so trying to find something I'd enjoy was complete guesswork.  After one bite of what I thought was a noodle turned out to be (I think) eel, I tossed the buffet and ordered some fried rice from the menu.  Wasn't inedible, but still burnt and greasy.

I wanted to give more stars here because there wasn't anything seriously wrong with it, but I couldn't think of any two-star-worthy positives."}
{"text":"This is a hard pass for me.  After eating lunch there I find their sanitation seriously questionable. Eat here at your own risk.  

 I have worked at some very fine high end sushi establishments in my time and even those places tend to cut corners (behind the scenes) so every time I eat at a new sushi establishment I keep my eyes open for red flags.  While dining at Ru San's during lunch I happen to catch quite a few gross warning signs and therefore I will not be coming back here under any circumstance. Which is sad because I was super excited about an all you can eat sushi lunch and was even willing to treck the 40 minutes out of my way on the regular if this place lived up to the hype.  

First of all as of March 2018 they had a Sanitation score of 91 which is already pretty low for my standards.  They also had servesafe certificates hung alongside.  Typically  servesafe certificates add points to a score so that means that they actually have a high 80s score.  Thats some B grade sushi bs that I don't want to mess with.

2ndly their buffet while impressive at 1st glance was a huge disappointment.  NOTHING IS LABELED! This seems dangerous for people with allergies and illegal but obviously probably not but still you would think they would want to cover their asses and label their seafood products. You only have your eyes to discern what you are actually eating and putting in your body.  However all the rolls seemed to be the same 3 ingredients (tuna, avocado, crab) just mixed around abit.  Every single fried roll they put out wasnt even remotely warm by the time it got onto the buffet.  As I eagerly waited for a fresh plate of fried sushi rolls to come out to the buffet it was clear that they still had been made at least 20 minutes prior to them coming out to the buffet.

And lastly the mother of all red flags happened at the end of our meal.  Our server truly did something so unspeakable and so appalling that I was flabbergasted by it for a few days.  My friend and I had finished our meal but we were still sitting around chatting because it was my birthday and we drove 40 minutes to get here so we were in no rush to leave.  There were still at least 5 tables sitting around us that were still eating. Everything down to our straw wrappers and soy sauce had been prebussed at this point and we only had our waters left in front of us.  I was planning on drinking my water down b4 we left so I would be hydrated for my trip back.  Then it happened.  Our server came over and STUCK HER FINGERS IN MY WATER to pick them up and THEN looks at me and asks me if I was done drinking it.  Well my jaw dropped open and obviously yeah after someone sticks their hands in your drink I'd say I'm done.

 Not only was this experience utterly disappointing but it also gave me the bad poops so yeah I am definietly not coming back to this nasty facility they call a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. I'm sure they have something for everyone on the menu. I've visited Ru San's multiple times and it is delicious every time. The drinks are priced extremely well for a restaurant in Charlotte. The atmosphere is also great. Only con would be the back area of the restaurant and the restrooms could use a little TLC."}
{"text":"You guys, you are not a true sushi lover if you haven't been to Ru Sans.

The sushi here is to die for, so amazing. The service is quick and the staff is so friendly.

They make really cool sushi rolls that you can find anywhere else. The fish is fresh and full of flavor. This place is honestly the most price friendly place to get sushi at in Charlotte without it lacking anything but greatness."}
{"text":"Best damn sushi buffet I've ever had, hands down. Get there early or you'll be waiting out the door for a table."}
{"text":"Meh...kind of feel steered wrong by my fellow yelpers. Overall, just \"meh\". 

I have seldom met a spider roll I didn't like so when I saw the Angry Crab Roll my insides got all gooey with excitement only to be served overly greasy, soggy crab without any crunch AND it was topped with fake crab AND it had romaine lettuce sticking out like a salad. 

Overall, just kind of sad knowing how amazing this roll could have been and the kind of place that makes me upset I did my hair for this.

The one nice thing, and reason it has 2 stars instead of 1 is because my server, Mauro, was very helpful, friendly, and efficient.

Really, all the staff is very friendly, they deserve better."}
{"text":"Love this place!  GIANT selection of specialty rolls and I can't get to try something new every time.  I've never been disappointed.  Wonderful, wonderful lunch buffet too."}
{"text":"I've been to Ru Sans a few times, and I've always left stuffed. Although I don't eat fish, Ru Sans has a variety of vegetarian sushi options. The prices on their rolls are excellent, and the food is always great. 

It's a little tight inside, but I went with a big group and we still were able to get seated. It wasn't ideal, but it was good enough. I've been in with a kid as well, and the staff was friendly with him and helped the mother get him situated and fed. 

Overall, it's earned its reputation as one of the best sushi spots in Charlotte. It's not pretentious, the food is good, the service is friendly, and the prices are great."}
{"text":"The look/atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  But if you want to go somewhere that you can get full on sushi for $10-$15, this is your place.  The lunch buffet is the best.  All you can eat sushi buffet for approximately $10.  They have 20ish different types of sushi on the bar and they are so good.  My only complaint is that they aren't labeled, so you don't really know what you're eating.  When you go for dinner, they have a huge sushi menu with several rolls under $5."}
{"text":"Decent sushi for a decent price. Huge selection of rolls, I had some decision issues when the waiter finally came around. I'm usually good with choosing rolls I want, but after 2 beers and 2 sake bombs, I was having issues with everything. Quality of sushi wasn't the worst I've had in CLT, but def not the best either. Space was large and well lit. Atmosphere was lively with the sushi chefs shouting greetings at everyone and cheering on any would be sake bomb drinkers. TVs are aplenty, which is nice if you want to watch a game whilst eating your face off. And parking is ample. The Ru San's in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta is better and has more selection, but the chefs share the same enthusiasm. I'll have to come back for $10 sushi buffet."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The lunch buffet is amazing (especially considering it's less than $11 per person). They have a good variety of different rolls and Chinese food on the lunch buffet.  For the dinner menu they also have extensive options, and a specials sheet that changes seasonally (which is really nice).  While the dinner menu is obviously pricier than the lunch menu it is still reasonable.  I recommend trying this place out, if for nothing else, for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Ru Sans since 95' in Atlanta, solid and great food!
  Either the lunch buffet or a delicious dinner, I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"You have to experience this place to understand my facinstion. Whether it's a custom order or served on their incredible lunch buffet THIS is Sushi at it's best. May I suggest \" Gone with the wind\". An absolute work of art! One of the most impressive works of edible art. There may be a foolish moment when it arrives at your table you consider sharing. Don't."}
{"text":"Came in today and had the rudest most unpleasant dining experience i have had in a long time. This was the worst customer service I have had all year long and tasted worse than many of Charlotte's other sushi selection.what can you expect when u get to pick sushi pieces off a dollar menu, let me know next time ill hit McDonald's.... First off my meal arrived 10 minutes prior to my friend's meal, they had forgotten it, I completely finished my food before they brought my friends meal. The sushi, I would say tastes like the per made at Harris teeter, oops I meant food lion. It fell apart as I was trying to grab half of it and I had not gotten the spicy aioli I ordered out on top of everything as I asked...

   Meanwhile the waitress was running around doing lord knows what and seemed to want to have nothing to do with us, she was a tall older caucasian lady. Never once was I asked how's my food, which it was bad and wrong. It honestly seemed that the bus boy was getting us drinks and was communicating with our server for us. Ridiculous. 

After my friend finishes eating, we sit talking for ten minutes hoping to get our check and the waitress has now been gone for over twenty minutes...I had to ask a random server to get our check and bring it to us.  our waitress comes up drops the bills off and leaves not even bothering to communicate what it was she had disappeared for or apologize for us having to ask Someone else to do her work.
 
On top of all the terrible service and disgusting food received so far.. She added a beer to the wrong check and completely messes up the bill. To our luck the manager walks up. I try and tell her a mistake was made but the lady speaks next to Zero English. It was like talking to the Great Wall of China. And to my surprise it looks like the lady is getting angrier as i tell her they have made a mistake it was like talking to my 8 year old nephew. As I'm in the middle of trying to explain to her she rudely Snatches the bill and my money out of my hand and walks away after telling me that I am cursing at her which I am not at all. On top of all this TErrible service. They then bring me the wrong amount of change, short a few dollars. Brought by some short fat girl with a buzz covered in tattoos, wierd. She then proceeds to tell us that we should not be rude to the owner of the place and if we do not like the food we should not come back. expecting an apology from the staff, me and my friend were obviously shocked at the lack of care and disrespect this establishment shows to its patrons. I threw the remaining cents in my pocket on the table in disgust, only as a bitter reminder of her atrocity to waitressing and the management in general at Rusan's.

This was my third time here and i will never be returning. I live in the neighborhood and am glad to say they have lost my business and i hope yours too if you read this.This place was a HORROR SHOW."}
{"text":"8.50 sushi buffet, your expectations can't be that high.

But! The sushi is actually pretty good, and they even have sashimi. You can tell not all the sushi/sashimi's not fresh, but I guess that's why it's 8.50. 

Place is pretty crowded but kept clean for the most part!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this place more than several times and for several years, tonight the service was the worst. I understand everyone has to start from somewhere but the server had no business working on the floor and it's a slow Monday night. He should have been trained better before hitting the floor. What should have been a 45 minute dinner tops, turned into a 90 minute dinner. Quite disappointing!"}
{"text":"1. My family and I love sushi!!! We have wanted to try Ru Sans for quite some time now. Tonight did not disappoint!!!

2. Appetizers of pork potstickers and beef yakitori.....delicious!

3. Sushi rolls...shrimp tempura maki, crunchy mui beno, red devil, and dragon fly....all freaking awesome!!!! Absolutely delicious!!!!

4. Service was excellent!!!! Nothing fancy, just great food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ditto Annie - decent sushi for a decent price.  Service is quick and the place is always jammed at lunch.  I love the unlimited buffet but could you please label the plates so I know what I am picking up?  I am not too picky but geez some of it you dont want to waste the stomach space on.  I will definitely be back but I will also keep an eye on your sanitation rating Ru Sans!  Dont let me down again!!"}
{"text":"i ate there a few weeks ago for some take out sushi. i ordered two sushi rolls and the total came out to over twenty dollars!!! i was like, \"how is that possible the rolls were only $7.50 a piece?\" the waiter then said they charge a 10% gratuity for all take out orders. i'm like how unfair is that? who adds a mandatory 10%, to your bill, especially when a waiter or waitress didn't even serve you food? am i paying a 10% gratuity for the fact the fact that you put my food in a box? i have never heard of such a thing..  smh ?"}
{"text":"Again food was ok.
Now talk about getting take out
not eating at the restaurant calling up for an order to go..

This us the only place that adds a tip to your take out bill.
THAT IS TOTALLY WRONG!!!!"}
{"text":"Originally tried this restaurant in Atlanta and really enjoyed. Was very happy to see that they have a Charlotte location. I accidentally ordered the wrong roll, but my server was kind enough to let me order something else that I would like more. Overall good experience and great food!"}
{"text":"For what Ru San's is--a cheap place to get decent sushi--it excels. It offers a very happy medium between fancy (and pricey) sushi with impeccable presentations and the stale and often sketchy \"to-go\" sushi you find in grocery stores. 

Here you can find quick service and tasty rolls that won't break the bank. Against all odds, the menu ordered by price (e.g., $1+, $1.5+, $2+) is not only convenient but are of much higher quality that you would expect. As not a huge fan of fish, I was rather excited to see a very palatable and extensive veggie section. It is nice to have options beyond \"the veggie roll\" and indeed the Veggie Futo Maki legitimately rocked my world.

I will say that the lunch buffet--even at the ridiculously price of like $10 for all you can eat sushi, fried noodles, chicken wings, miso soup, and some other classics--was somewhat of a let down. The rolls are mostly rice, often fried, and contain cream cheese. While all of these are a few of my favorite things (along with whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses), it makes the meal a bit too heavy for having sushi. Plus, there were no veggie options. Overall the buffet does not do Ru San's justice, so I recommend ordering from the menu.

Finally, it can be a bit cold in there, at least during the summers. Do consider bringing a light sweater."}
{"text":"A Charlotte Sushi institution!  Lunch buffet is awesome, fresh, and delicious, and the chocolate mousse cake and strawberry cake are to die for!"}
{"text":"Hello, buffet (delicious) sushi! I frequent this place about once every 2 weeks or so. You can sit at a table (if available) or at the bar where you can watch the sushi being made in front of you. They have hot items, salads and desserts on one bar and all kinds of sushi rolls on another. They are constantly re-stocking the bars with fresh rolls and there is always a great variety. Best of all-because it's a buffet-it's super fast! I know I can get in and get out and get a good meal in the process.

**As of November 1st they no longer allow buffet takeout... in case you were looking forward to doing so...**"}
{"text":"Best lunch buffet deal- all you can eat Sushi!  Now that I live in California, I can't believe I didn't take more advantage of that option.  Interesting rolls and fresh sushi.  Always busy and pretty loud, very fun!"}
{"text":"They have decent price for sushi. But OMG workers there can be so rude! If you plan on calling for Togo orders or to speak to someone during dinner time, THINK AGAIN! They will literally pick up the phone and hang up on you! Thats just RUDE!"}
{"text":"Great place to have sushi and saki! This place is big. It can handle big groups as well. I tried a couple of the special appetizers. I was not thrilled with the fried zucchini and jalape√±o poppers but they were not bad. The sushi roll I had was awesome. The place does get busy. The only thing I would mention was that towards the end, we couldn't get our bill. We were ready to pay and get going but because it was super busy, it took a while to get our bill. I had to stand up for a while because I was tired of sitting down."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has 3 1/2 stars. This is by far the best sushi place in Charlotte and totally normal prices. I'm a bit of a sushi snob and can't eat it anywhere. So with that I give this place 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Charlotte and were eating here within the hour since our daughter said this was the best sushi. Since we were just back from Japan, it was good but not Japan worthy. I did like the huge number of selections available but the service is a bit on the slow side. The pork belly fried rice was good but not worth it and some of the rolls were good. I was most impressed by the Sea waves since the mussels were good and the spinach with it was excellent. The tuna tatami was nothing special at all- wish I could get my money back for this dish."}
{"text":"Good value.  Only one small section of Salmon Nigiri (no other kinds) on the buffet and lots of different rolls. 

If you I have never been here let me tell you how it works. Get here at 11:15am, before they open, and you will stand in line to get in.  That is not a worry though, because there are plenty of tables and seats at the bars. I will tell you this place is a MADHOUSE!!!  When I left there were people standing in line out the door.

For the lunch buffet I was in an out in 30 minutes.

The sushi quality is good but it is a buffet so you're not going to get top of the line.  There are two Buffet tables set up... one has a nice variety of rolls, and the other has a few traditional Japanese Buffet items....with one small section of salmon nigiri.

Service was very friendly and very fast.  Neat experience to be somewhere this busy, and the quality of sushi is decent.

 But I've had better."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Both of my sisters absolutely love this place, so they suggest it all the time. I'm a huge fan of sushi, but I don't get the appeal of this restaurant so far. 

I think their sushi is decent, but not amazing. Maybe because I usually do the sushi buffet, so it's made in mass quantities and has been sitting out for a little while. (If I go again, I'll try ordering something off the actual menu and write an updated review.) It's also confusing because the buffet food isn't clearly labeled! I love trying different types of sushi, so I don't mind this. But it'd be nice to know the names of each so I could get more of the ones I enjoyed.

The presentation/environment of the restaurant is not great either. It's squished and crowded. It also seems a bit dirty.

I've never had a problem with their service, though! Their wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This could have been a five star review if it was only relative to the food.  But I bumped it down just because of the no frills type place it is and the fact it can be extremely loud with all the sushi chefs constantly yelling or it's more like war cries but whatever.  I walked in there today and one of them started giving me a power clap style ovation....meh....my kind of guy so I obliged with my own clapping right back!  All in good fun :)

Ok, so no other place in Charlotte does a sushi buffet like this joint.  If you are hungry you can't find a better deal, it's something like $10, for all you can eat.  You could easily spend that on just 2 rolls anywhere else.  The sushi here is kind of \"Americanized\" in my opinion.  I'm not complaining but seriously, just know that if you eat sushi that has been deep fried, um, that's not healthy.  

They keep time labels on the sushi plates so as to make sure the sushi is the freshest it can be but normally the sushi runs out before the time does, so that should tell you something!  It's really good.  

I will continue to keep Ru San's in my Ru-tation for great local sushi spots! :)

Note: It can get crowded so I suggest getting there as close to 11:30 for lunch, otherwise you may have to wait (even though probably not long)."}
{"text":"Love their sushi selection! Always fresh and delicious too...always ordering too much and stuffing myself. Have a great selection of non-sushi items as well. The ambiance is great. Order a saki-bomb and see what happens! The place comes alive!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of sushi period.  But I'm even more of a fan of sushi that's fresh, flavorful, and CHEAP!  I know it sounds crazy, but the $5.95 Philly Roll was mind-blowing.  Ha-ha.  Definitely, try it.  The nigri was delicious and while it may sound insane, they have the best miso soup I've ever had-in my life.  A simple thing, but so good for the soul.  :)  I would say that anyone who hasn't been-must go....like NOW.  What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"We are here at least once a year a celebration and it has never failed to please. We try at least one new dish and have only found more good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love ru san's.

Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. 

I know that they have a lunch buffet that they have during the week and saturday for just $10. I have never had it because I'm allergic to shellfish and vegetarian, but my friends seem to love it. 

The cream cheese tempura roll and it is to die for."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun atmosphere paired with awesome Japanese food then you can't go wrong with Ru San. I have been coming to Ru San's since I moved to Charlotte about 7 years ago. Sushi, awesome service, sake-bombs, hip environment... yeah it's hard not to like this place."}
{"text":"I highly, HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving Japanese food. The prices were very reasonable for a nice dinner (less than $50 for two people AFTER a 20% tip.) Service and food were both excellent."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST sushi restaurant ever! Service is great and their sashimi is beyond words especially the Napoleon sashimi! Loveeee this place!! Service is always great here."}
{"text":"In Charlotte, this is by far the best sushi I have had! Matter of fact I can't think of too many places I've been that is just all around the bomb.  First off, I love how cheap the maki rolls are, but they maintain the quality.  Their specialty rolls are the bomb!!!  Don't feel limited to what is on the menu. If you see something you like you can modify, but be careful it can get pricy when you start building your own.  We usually come for the buffet every Saturday, and when my fiance is off during the week.  We've been for dinner as well.  I prefer their regular menu, just because I can get what I want, but I love the buffet because I can have the best of everything!  I just love this place and can't get enough of it!  If we ever leave Charlotte, Ru Sans will be the standard for every sushi place I try.  As a matter of fact it already is!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Ru Sans. Always try to hit this place when in Downtown Charlotte.

Fish is prepared well, huge menu, great prices.

Not much more to say - I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Love eating here! The sushi is alway great and the staff is very friendly! Definitely worth checking out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"As someone who cannot eat fish, I always expect just okay noodles when going out for sushi with my boyfriend. Ru Sans has a HUGE menu - it is mostly sushi which I don't enjoy, but I was still impressed that they were even able to offer so many things. I don't remember exactly what it was called, but I had spicy udon noodles with vegetables - they were indeed very spicy! I love spicy food, and these almost seemed too spicy, but yet I could not stop eating them. So delicious! The fried rice has an almost smokey flavor to it (my boyfriend says its from authentic use of a wok), and both entrees left us with a bill under $30 for dinner. Not bad! The entire staff was very friendly; the guys rolling sushi on the line said hello and goodbye to us, and thanked us for coming in....all six of them at once - it was overwhelming when we came in, but when we left we gathered that it is custom to their culture, which in the end I found to be a bit endearing. Overall, a very friendly, fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I stop in on every visit to Charlotte
Once a month.  Also a regular at the Atlanta location. Great Sushi every time"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan. The sushi was ok. I've had so much better. I just wasn't impressed with the quality of sushi. The staff was nice though. I probably won't be returning but everything is always worth a try"}
{"text":"Jonathan T. and I might be sharing a brain, because I may have also turned a corner on my love for RuSan's.... the quality is just not there sometimes.

I can't do the lunch buffet any longer - the sloppy rolls, no bueno. Plus it's not $9.95!

Will still go here for dinner though - I think their care and freshness are still A+ after the lunch crowd leaves.

If you're a sushi connoisseur SKIP THE LUNCH! Just go for dinner :)"}
{"text":"The price is reasonable for sushi, and the menu has a an unparalleled amount of variety. It's a fun environment and the staff interacts well with the patrons.
My problem is the food. It's just such a poor quality of product. The fish, while fresh enough, has some of the lowest quality of cuts I have ever experienced. Fatty in a bad way, gristle, and poorly sliced.
For example: the dynamite yaki has large pieces of octopi in the bake. Super chewy to the point of being difficult to eat. The baked tuna was an off putting gray color, and the salmon well over cooked.
Agadashi (sp?) tofu is fried and the coating resembles funnel cake batter. The \"healthy\" seeming nature and intricate flavor of the dish is completely lost on the preparation.
I had several pieces of sashimi that were thickly cut, sinewy, and dry/old.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Charlotte. They have a great buffet as well. I wish they served fountain sodas (they bring a can) but other than that, they are great!!"}
{"text":"I love RuSans! Their sushi, teriyaki rice ball, lunch buffet, ramen, and so much more! If you want great sushi at reasonable prices...do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Bar none, the best sushi in Charlotte! Friendly staff and amazing sushi options. It's very new age sushi with the perfect blend of tradition."}
{"text":"Wow....I have never been here for lunch during the week........and I have never seen nor experienced the buffet......but I did this last Monday.

It was a bank holiday, so I decided to have a little sushi for lunch and headed to Ru San's.  At 2pm in the afternoon I expected this place to be dead....I was dead wrong!

It was packed and I was told about the lunch buffet.  $10 for all you could eat of both sushi and a small hot tray area.

I quality of sushi was \"ok\" though without names I wasn't sure of about 80% of what I was eating sushi wise.

Wait staff were all over the place, but did get my beers in a timely manner so no issues there.

PROs - I was glad to get my fill of sushi  at a really good price.......

CONs - The mass of people and craziness was not for me.

Still love the place........but without the buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a reasonable price. Ultimate tuna, rich and famous, steak roll, kiss of fire, and gladiator rolls are some of our favorites."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great deal on sushi this is the place. There lunch buffet comes with an okay selection of sushi along with noodles, fried calamari, meso soup, and ginger salad. It's a value you just cant find any where else.

The staff is extremely friendly but dont expect to be seated until your entire party has arrived. This is understandable as the place is basically filled from the time they open at 11:30am until lunch ends at 2:30. 

We did some Saki bombs and our waitress was kind enough to bring over some napkins just in case they were needed. Our waters were always full and plates cleared quickly.

Don't expect too much in terms of quality and selection if your going to their buffet. But its still a good value for what you pay. If you are picky about sushi, order what you like off their normal menu and you'll be happier. Their normal prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Thrice have I now indulged in the wonderful lunch buffet that is Ru San's.  Each time I've gone, I have loved it more than the last.  For $9.99 at lunch time, you can eat as much of their tasty sushi as you like.  On the buffet, they usually have about 12 or so different types of maki rolls that you can eat.  On the other table, they have sushi, delicious fried calamari, stir-fry, desserts, and other little appetizers and salads, in case you get sick of just eating maki rolls.  They keep rotating out different kinds of rolls throughout the lunch period.  I was surprised on how many different types of rolls they put out.  

Yes, it is pretty much always busy here at lunch time.  Yes, you have to buy individual cans or bottles of drinks (particularly soda and beer).  It can get pretty noisy with all the people, and sometimes it gets a little difficult to get into the buffet lines.  I can never figure out which direction you're supposed to go, which is mildly chaotic.  Even when they first open, there's often a line outside the door waiting to get in.  Sometimes, when it's really busy, you have to wait a few minutes before the servers come so you can pay your tab.  If you don't mind that, this place is delicious, fast, and pretty cheap for a sushi lunch.

That being said, I've never been to dinner, so I can't speak as to that aspect.  At lunch time the servers basically just clear plates, which I've never had a problem with."}
{"text":"Gotta say, Ru San's is the warmest sushi restaurant ever. Everyone is super friendly, from the hostess to the guys behind the counter. And their $5 lunch box is incredible. Buffet style, self serve sushi, plus the chefs will handroll something fresh if you ask nicely. They even have fried chicken wings and stirfry dishes.
The first time I went, the chef was disappointed that I could CLOSE THE LID on my box, and insisted I go back for more. This isn't a place for sushi snobs, but it's an awesome, cheap, filling and friendly experience."}
{"text":"While I am not a Japanese food expert and definitely not a sushi expert by any means, I must say I have pretty high standards for both. For me, this establishment has done something that very, very few have done before. It gave me a feeling of satisfaction with my sushi. To me, sushi is a type of cuisine based around sticky rice that often involves raw fish. I believe it should be painstakingly prepared by masters with simple yet amazing flavor and design.

While I tried to stay away from their original rolls, the traditional sashimi was expertly prepared. The big bowl udon was fantastic and had all of the old-school additions that remind me of home (I'm chinese by the way.) The beef tataki had good flavor and a good grill on the edges with a nice balanced dipping sauce. The sushi and sashimi assortment dinner is a most-try for those who are new to this type of cuisine.

While all of the food hit the right marks for me, let's talk service. Oh man.. service.  It. Was. Crazy. While some restaurants assert a need to keep things clean and customers happy. The staff here insured every glass was always full of your chosen non-alcoholic beverage. They kept every bottle of sauce full as well with even the smallest amount used to be replaced immediately.  If that isn't pedantic service than I don't know what is. The server even poured my first cup of sake, which is extremely respectful in my eyes.

This place would receive a five star but I feel five stars are only for the restaurants that can either change my ideals, give my a cathartic experience or something along those lines. But it this establishment was just about to hit that mark."}
{"text":"Hip, industrial-chic sushi restaurant with oodles of choices on offer. The mood is young, fun-loving, and a little wacky--not at all uptight or pretentious. As my brother, a Charlotte sushi-lover, says, you come to Ru San for the rolls and go elsewhere if you're in the mood for nigiri.

 We absolutely loved the tuna tataki (piles of perfectly seared tuna atop crisp vegetable filaments with a side of pure heaven as a dipping sauce). Other winners included the Olympic Five Ring Roll, served with yet another divine sauce, this time a spicy aioli, and the Firecracker Roll, quite possibly the most delicious roll I've ever had. As another reviewer pointed out, their specialties tend toward the deep-fried and saucy, but that's ok by me. Just add edamame and Asahi for a nutritious, balanced meal. 

Apparently Ru San plummeted in quality when chef and owner Ru left town, but now he's back and has restored the place to its former glory."}
{"text":"Years later and this is still one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte. I personally think the sushi here is way better than what you'd get at Pisces. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"They have the BEST Chirashi Bowl in town, hands DOWN! Years ago, I would order this and it was only $15 bucks.  No one knew about this and I thought it was such a bargain because it comes in a BIG bowl of full on sashimi with soup or salad. I thought it was my little secret so whenever I come here, I always ordered it since I loved it so much. They are very generous with the type of fish as well.  Then after telling my friends about this or they would see my chirashi order comes out (who also has the SAME love for sashimi like I do), they now all ordered it too.  I guess it gained popularity and attentions from the owners/workers since we would have like a table of 4 orders of just chirashi bowls at least 2x or 3x times in a week.  That's A LOT of sashimi but it was so good!  Maybe Rusan's picked up that this was too much of a bargain and upped their prices to $17.95 (considering other sushi places around town at the time 2-3 yrs ago were overcharging chirashi bowl for $22-$25 for a small dinky bowl of raw fish).  What I thought was a steal now is no longer a steal. :(

I was a little upset they would do this but it's still a good deal in Charlotte whenever I'm craving sashimi so much.  Then last summer, they increased the prices up to $19.95, um what?!  I came back last month and I found out they took the Chirashi bowl off their newly updated menu but I still ordered it.  Finds out they charged it to around $22.95 or something like that now. What a bummer.  I won't be surprised if they kept increasing it to $25. Oh well, it doesn't bothers me now since I don't go there often but looks to me like they don't want many people to order it anymore if they had taken it off the menu.  Although I'm a little upset of the increasing prices, I have to say for the most part the chirashi bowls are always extremely abundant & impressive.  This place always has the best sushi and apps as well.  It's also not that pricey at all and you can get pretty full without spending a lot. 

Service however, sometimes sucks.  They're never known for their service so don't even bother reviewing about it. It's standard.

They have all you can eat sushi on the weekdays during lunch for $12 bucks (I think) so that's a good deal.  Except all the sushi are very basic (cheap to make) with tons of rice outside and very tiny sushi fillings. Yeah, they're trying to fool you in thinking you're eating for cheap, they know it! haha. Good way for them to make money by trying to get rid of their leftovers. (?)"}
{"text":"Good was great my tummy is very happy. Staff was slammed so service could be better. Line out the door before it even opened and through our entire meal days something about the quality"}
{"text":"I was wowed by this place the second I looked at the menu. Sushi that didn't break the bank but very fresh! We sat at the bar and watched the sushi gods make amazing rolls! I had hot tea but next time will definitely try one of the Sake mixed drinks. I had my eye on the sake pomegranate. I like that it has other options besides Sushi since my husband isn't a fan. He got the noodle dish with beef which was ahhhhmazzzing! We both loved it. They have a lunch buffet on the weekends for less than 12. Which I hope to check out soon. Outdoor patio seating is clutch for the warmer weather! It was decently busy but no wait and food came out quick! Walked out under 40 bucks w. Tip! 2 drinks(non-alcoholic), an appetizer & 2 dinners!"}
{"text":"First time at Ru San's and the sushi/sashimi was amazing. They provided a cucumber appetizer upon seating which was a great surprise. I ordered three pieces of yellow tail, two smoked salmon and one piece of scallop sashimi along with their kiss of fire roll. The kiss of fire is mix is tuna and salmon with avocado, topped with sriracha sauce.  Their wait staff are very friendly and welcoming.  I'd give this place ten stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Ru San's you disappoint me. Really, really disappoint me. If you know anything about the tradition of sushi, this is the rebellious son of the traditional eats saying \"screw you, dad, I'm going to play my loud music and go CRAZY. To hell with your tradition\". Ru San's is loud, slow, and the plating/rolls are messy.

My date and I waited a whole hour and a half before our food came. The waiter was really nice and continued to profusely apologize for the chef's terrible pace (and he comped us free salad too), but a good waiter can't make up for a bad place.

They do have loads of veggie maki rolls, which is a plus. We ordered the cranberry roll, sweet potato roll, teriyaki zucchini roll, inari roll, and kimchi roll. The cranberry was messy and the kimchi was a bit... off but aside from that they were okay.

Don't come here if you have somewhere to be after (I did and I ended up missing it). I'd just say \"don't come here\" in general, but seeing I have yet to find some place better in CLT to go, I guess if you have the time and enjoy loud atmospheres, here's the place for you."}
{"text":"Favorite Sushi in Charlotte! Affordable and great service"}
{"text":"Really really good sushi here but kinda pricey. Always really crowded so there's usually a little wait. It's a staple in our sushi diet."}
{"text":"i only go for the chicken fried rice!!!! i'm writing in all caps because it is that crucial to try!! big enough to share!!! delicious enough you won't want to!! you will look at all other fried rice with disappointment after you try ru san's. 

thank me later."}
{"text":"The sushi and the Yakitori were both lacking. The tuna didn't taste fresh and the Yakitori was drowned in sauce to cover up its lack of flavor.  Are there any AUTHENTIC sushi places in this town if so please let me know"}
{"text":"Lunch hour Mon-Fri is ALWAYS busy! So be prepared to wait..... Of course the wait is well worth it. Took my sister here for all you can eat sushi. Food was amazing of course. Everything was fresh and made to perfection. Our waitress was very sweet even though she was busy running around.... Left a nice tip of course."}
{"text":"I go about once a week. The sushi is fantastic and you can't beat the lunch buffet price. Friday's at noon is a bad idea though. It's so crowded you can't get in the door and the food gets gobbled up almost as fast as they can put it out. They are usually pretty fast about getting more done though. So final word, avoid Friday lunch, but a must go for lunch any other day."}
{"text":"Went last Saturday night, the first time in a while.  There were 6 of us and we got a big table immediately.  The waitress was very attentive and I was very happy with my meal.  My only compl"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and fun atmosphere! Wait staff is also very friendly  Great place for a fun group of folks."}
{"text":"Ok, I will give this place an honest 3.5 Yet I keep coming back even though I tell myself I wouldn't. Why? because when you get those sushi cravings, there is no other place in Charlotte, or let alone many parts of the US that is like this. Maybe in New York or like San Francisco...but definitely not in Charlotte. The LUNCH BUFFET that everyone else is raving about is the only thing I have tried. You have a good amount of sushi roll selections, raw, fried, vegetarian and sashimi!! I think the sashimi section is what makes it worth it, 4 plates, usually 2 tuna and 2 salmon. They used to just put out raw sashimi slices around a certain time but the past few times I've been, they stopped doing that (the sashimi is stuck to a a rice roll). That was a huuuge bummer. But oh well, I still come back. Their miso soup is terrible, too pasty and not flavorful at all, no tofu or seaweed it in just the soup. Their lo-mein is also really bad, drenched in sesame oil, which is VERY heavy. I LOOVE their fried rice though, it's quite fluffy mixed with diced carrots and peas. Their calamari is also pretty good. 

Also to be fair, I have heard a good amount of sanitation problem with this place, but I think since their last incident a good 5 years or so back, they have really tried to step it up. Never heard about sexual harrassement but I wouldn't be surprised. 

Try to get here early for the lunch buffet otherwise you would have to wait and it is a PAIN!"}
{"text":"I like Ru Sans. It's good if you're craving sushi and you want something quick and easy. The vibe in there is very casual. The food is good, but it's far from fancy. They have a good selection of rolls and the prices are reasonable. The waitstaff is also quite good.

The lunch buffet is craaaazy. It's a great value, but it's unlike any sushi buffet I've ever been too. It's pure chaos. But they have a lot of sushi and non-sushi options. If you're willing to put up with the chaos, it's a great deal. 

I tried the ramen there and although it tasted good, it wasn't authentic ramen. If you're used to ramen in NY, SF or DC, don't order it here. But it's not a bad soup. 

I like it here if I want something quick and easy. I'm not blown away, but it's pretty good. Ideally I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I tend to round up. 4 it is."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down. Have been here a few times for dinner and finally made it for their lunch and it was amazing. All of the sushi was fresh and they made sure there was plenty available for everyone."}
{"text":"Went today for the sushi buffet and while the food was decent enough for a buffet setting I was not a fan of a few things:
- the sushi rolls were not labeled
- tongs were not available for each plate causing people to use the same tong for multiple plates
- the sushi side of the buffet was kind of a mess when it came to forming a line

I will give it to them, the food was fresh and rotated very often. Each time I went up to the sushi table there was a fresh plate for several of the rolls.

My boyfriend isn't a fan of sushi so he sampled the hot food ... it was pleasant enough but it lacked variety. 

Overall we had a good time, but I don't think we will add this into the rotation until we sample more places to see what's out there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.

Good Food and lots of choices!  Great prices.

Nice atmosphere with plenty of booth seating, outdoor seating and bar seating with a couple of tv's."}
{"text":"The service is quick for a to go order but the strangest thing happens.  I got charged a service charge. Why is it a service charge for a to go order?"}
{"text":"Great sushi lunch buffet!! Love it"}
{"text":"Ru Sans is amazing. Always busy, but worth the wait. I try to get a different sushi roll every time I go, which is easy since their sushi menu is huge. Their sashimi is amazing as well. If you like sushi, and you haven't been here, you're missing out big time!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte I've been looking for an all you can eat sushi lunch special. I loved the one in my college town and I haven't found one like it yet, but this is a pretty close second. I prefer the made to order all you can eat style but this buffet is pretty good! Usually people hear sushi buffet and immediately think yuck I'm gonna get sick but that's not true with this place. Lunch is always busy and the sushi never sits on the buffet longer than 10 minutes, goes like hot cakes. They put out a good variety including specialty rolls and the quality is good. This isn't 5 star gourmet sushi or anything but it's definitely good for the price of 11.95 for lunch. Definitely give it a try, might have to wait for a table and the service is ok,but considering it's a buffet there's not much to do unless your ordering off the menu. I'm excited to try it for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! We go here once a week. Huge menu. Great prices. The staff is very friendly. We are constantly taking new people with us. This is by far our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nostalgia dominates my rating.

This place is still excellent, but the prices have crept up and the service has declined.  Even with this gentle slide it is by far my favorite place to get sushi in the queen city.

The pros are they have one of the more imaginative all you can eat buffets.  They have my favorite dish which includes fried crispy spinach and vinegar.  I got my wife into sushi at this very restaurant.

Cons: loud, loud, loud.  Busy, busy, busy.  It is hard to find a parking spot, it is hard to find a seat, it is hard to hear anything not being shouted at you.

If you want to really revel in food and have some nice drinks: RuSan for the win."}
{"text":"Another cheap sushi buffet place. My friends were all praise abt this place before I  tried it myself. Sushi is below average but worth the buffet price. Filled my hungry stomach but  not satisfied with taste. For three, bill was $29.15 on Saturday lunch buffet, which is cheap."}
{"text":"The only thing you need to know about Ru San's:

All you can eat sushi lunch buffet.

The selection of rolls and sushi is neither varied or exceptional but for $10 you can't go wrong. Ru San's definitely has the best bang for buck sushi in the area hands down!"}
{"text":"Maybe I have finally turned the corner and become a sushi snob!  I stopped in here the other day for the lunch buffet and was less than pleased with the quality of food.  I've been here for the buffet in the past but its been awhile.  

I do realize that it's a $10 sushi buffet so expecatations were set accordingly.  The mushy avacado is the rolls was just unacceptable.  The huge bowl of wasabi was just weak at best.  

My suggestion would be to skip the buffet and go get sushi somewhere else.  Sacrificing the quality of the ingredients just isnt worth the low price."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It is SO good and definitely has the best buffet around, and I typically don't care for buffets."}
{"text":"The lighting is way too bright and our waitress wasn't amazing.  The Cowboy Maki roll is delicious, i suggest pairing it with ponzu sauce.  The steak roll is not good at all.  I love that they have mochi too."}
{"text":"Ru San's has been on my \"must try\" list for ages, but having a husband that doesn't eat sushi doesn't bode well for me sometimes. Thankfully, our friends decided to have their birthday dinner there, so my husband was forced to buck it up and take one for the team and I'm so glad he did!  The sushi was a fresh, unique, and delicious as I've been told. We had several rolls for the table to share and each one was better than the last. My husband had a noodle dish and was very pleased as well.  We had a few specialty cocktails, too. We loved it all, from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times when I'm charlotte it's basically the only place I eat sushi when I come here. The customer service is so on point, and the food is AMAZING. get here early if you go on the weekends because there's always a wait."}
{"text":"The pro's - $1 rolls actually do not taste as bad as $1 rolls should
I love the parking lot (unlike KO). Mui Buena roll. Cheap. 

The con's- A lot of fried stuff...not a ton of simple elegant rolls. The quality of the fish- well couldn't really taste that over all of the fried stuff. Not everyone wants sriracha on everything. Do not try the plum wine- yuck. The rolls seemed a bit sloppy. I think they would do much better if they scaled back and took their time when making a roll. They need to figure out tastes and flavors that work nicely together and then they would be set. 



Mui Buena - best
Calif roll- pretty standard
Shrimp Ceviche roll- eh just ok  
Spricy Tuna- nothing special
Gone with the Wind- a bit ridiculous in my opinion...not a ton of flavor here although interesting concept. It absolutely is a \"whirlwind\" as the menu describes it
Crunchy Tuna- most fish in the sushi but it wasnt spectacular by any means. This was the only roll left unfinished. 
American Flag Roll- didnt try but it heard it was bad...swimming in a weird sauce that covered every inch (literally) of the plate...just odd. 

I would go back and give it another try - but it's definitely not my favorite..."}
{"text":"I've only been for the sushi lunch buffet, but it's such a steal. Unlimited sushi and a few hot dishes for around $12, and the quality of the sushi isn't too bad. We try to get a group together once a lunch to enjoy it."}
{"text":"so i used to go to ru sans way back in the day for their lunch buffet, this was before they expanded.  i always liked it just fine, good/decent food for a good price but it faded in my brain and i forgot about it.  then i went there again wednesday night.  half price bottle of good wine, couple rolls, couple pieces of sashimi and am back on the runsans train.  not only have they made the resty twice as big since i was there last it still has an upbeat atmosphere and extremely reasonable prices, actually id almost call it cheap.  so i summation, rusans is the best value for sushi in the city and how can you go wrong with half price bottles of wine?  i'll be back there a lot"}
{"text":"Ru San's is definitely on heavy rotation for dinner.  It's not the best sushi, but it's good and it's cheap!  I call it Everyday Sushi.  

It's also one of the ony places that serves decent skewers.  Definitely try to the tempura enoki and salmon skin.  The siracha sauce on the table stops me from having to bother the waiter for it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rusans sooo many times for dinner but haven't been for the buffet.  

Being off work on Labor Day we decided to check it out. The buffet starts at 11:30.  My recommendation is to get there right when it starts.  There were tons of options from regular rolls, fried rolls, teriyaki chicken, soup, salad, dessert, etc.  I tried to take some pictures but it was so crowded that I couldn't get good ones!   The whole restaurant was filled without an empty seat in the place.

The service was incredible and the lines went fast for sushi and all of the extras.  When a dish ran out, it was replaced immediately.  

The best part of it all..... the price!!  $11.99"}
{"text":"Everyone has been telling me for weeks that since we now live in SouthEnd, we need to walk down to Ru San's.  We did... and likely won't very often.

We strongly prefer the normal size sushi and aren't fans of paying for a more expensive roll only to find out that it has more rice than the other rolls.  If a piece of sushi takes more than a bite, I'm not as big on it.  I like a roll to encapsulate all the flavors, not to get a little of this and a little of that in two bites.  That being said, wasn't a fan of the 'Dancing Eel'.  

Service was definitely sub par and the place is crazy noisy.  We plan to go back another time and will try the outdoor seating.  Also, the protein bomb looks great as it's hard to screw up nagiri.  The Cowboy was okay and the dumplngs were average dumplings.  

With better service, extract the noise, and ordering different things, there is still a chance for good food here.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and 3rd chances.  Check out the photos for what we ate!"}
{"text":"Ru San's has to be one of the most-reviewed places in Charlotte (not that really tells you much), and I'm not a big eater of sushi, so I probably won't be adding a lot here.

The restaurant itself is tucked into a nondescript strip mall off Park Road - and not likely the Park Road that you're likely to have seen towards the South side of Charlotte, but up near the center city instead.

If you happen to find it, you might be surprised by how large it is once you're inside, and apparently the menu is pretty good-sized as well.  I've actually never looked at it, as I've only been once, and that was for their lunch when I met friends there.

The lunch is a decently-priced $10 for all-you-care-to-eat sushi, but not being an expert on the cuisine, I can't say if it's particular good.  I actually ate a decent sampling of what was on the buffet, meaning it probably isn't that great.  I didn't really care for most of it, just because it didn't seem that fresh or tasty, and the fact that I took it at all means to me that it doesn't seem that great.  Take that to mean what you will!

During lunch there is also a small Chinese section to the buffet where you can get fairly standard Chinese fare too, but again, it's not that great.

Also, be warned that the place is simply packed.  Go early or late!"}
{"text":"This place is great for inexpensive and tasty sushi, but the menu is huge. If you liked what you ordered then make sure to remember the name, otherwise u might have a miss during your next meal."}
{"text":"Had a much better experience here. I could not believe we got sat right away. We came at a good time for dinner (6pm) and by the time we were done, the place was packed. Sushi was great. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they change the menu a lot! Half price wine bottles on wednesdays are always a plus."}
{"text":"Ru Sans is known for its sushi buffet. It has a great selection of rolls and some other Asian selections on the hot bar. The sushi quality isn't the highest but it is delicious. Service has always been good and fast."}
{"text":"Always fresh very kid friendly sushi buffet is awesome deal for families, my go to place."}
{"text":"Great Food and even better prices... though the service can be slow"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in years. Fresh, tons of choices, reasonably priced. We had two rolls, calamari and a side of shrimp tempura for $30 minus tip. Service was prompt and pleasant. Our waitress gave me the check which was funny; took it as a sign it's my turn to buy dinner so I did. The two rolls we had were beauts. Next time, we're getting three rolls and no app. No wait at dinner time. Perfect way to start 2015!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The Website is out of date and they do not offer the services that at plainly displayed on the website. Recommend Zen Fusion which has much better service and food.,"}
{"text":"So many options! Like it or not, I think that's a good thing for sushi spots. We have someone with a shellfish allergy so it's nice to have something other than plain salmon or tuna rolls. Came in late on a weeknight so can't speak to the wait time here, but the service was satisfactory and we got what we came for. Good tasty and semi creative sushi. The prices aren't bad but can get pricey if you have a huge appetite. Otherwise come on the days they have the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Came here because I thought that it would be similar to the ones in Atlanta.

The menu is the same; the service, however, is a lot different.

They are slow....as hell. As I'm sitting here with my stomach literally touching my spine (we've been sitting, at this point, for over 34 minutes waiting for our order), I'm starting to wonder if someone had to fly to Japan to get some fish out of their water to serve us in Charlotte.


Definitely don't come here if you're about to die from hunger because well, you just might.

PS: the bald guy (I'm assuming is the owner) literally forces a smile. Anyone who can't speak to a baby when a baby speaks is an assh*le off rip.

PS2: our waiter was nice and super cute. I want to put emphasis on this because he is not responsible for the kitchen's goings on and will be tipped accordingly."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place so I decided to go try to lunch sushi buffet because I've never been to one just for sushi lol. Overall the sushi was okay, pretty good not for anyone who is really picky about their sushi (I've worked at a Japanese resturant & my boyfriend is a Japanese chef). I would come back if I lived around there but I live pretty far lol. At first I was confused because of labels and what not. I really liked the service. The guy even though it was a very busy refilled our drinks very quickly! But for those who want to come try it I would give one heads up. 1.) Go close to the time they open for lunch because we went around 11 before it opened and there was already a line!"}
{"text":"Was good but I didn't like what I ordered was completely my fault but I will definitely be back if I'm in the Charlotte area again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi! Their dinner sushi is way better than their lunch sushi, but that's because they do an all you can easy sushi buffet for lunch. They also have a very fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went for the weekend lunch sushi buffet. It was $13 plus tax and tip, which is not a bad deal. Got maybe a dozen varieties of sushi and rolls, plus some other items like fried chicken wings, seared salmon and miso soup on the buffet line. The sushi is certainly better than the sushi you'll get at the usual Asian buffets."}
{"text":"First time at Ru San's... so so good! Enjoyed Angry Spider (meh), Cowboy Maki (so good with the mango salsa!), Dancing Eel (orgasm in my mouth), Mad Max (cucumber- licious!), Tootsie (so so good), and candy crush roll with strawberry sauce!!! Amazing service by Pamela aka D!!! Will definitely be back for more innovative sushi!"}
{"text":"COOL spot if your looking for some great sushi after hours! I have spent plenty of nights here sobering up. Somewhere between the hours of 10 and 12 O'clock at night. I have also spent more money here than I have at the bars (haha). 

Obviously, my favorite thing about Ru San's is that they stay open pretty late on most nights. It is one thing to find a place open during these hours, but even more difficult to find SUSHI at this time! They have really saved me from settling for Harris Teeter's two day old sushi. 

In my opinion, their sushi is absolutely fantastic! It is probably some of the best sushi I have ever had. It is one of those sushi restaurants where you can enjoy the raw stuff, because you KNOW that the fish is fresh. Far too many times have I eaten at a lower quality joint, where I couldn't order raw fish because it wasn't fresh.

It is not just the food that is great, but the service is always on point. There has not been a time yet that I have had an empty cup. This is important to me, as I tend to go through at least a gallon of water when I go out to eat (especially after drinking). The creativity that is put into every dish is very unique. This brings me to the downside as it can get very pricey. Also, make sure if your ordering from the \"special roll\" menu, to ask if it is actually a sushi roll or an entree. I have ordered a roll from this menu once, and when my food came out It was definitely not sushi. It was just a regular entree with some rice..I was very confused. 

I highly recommend this place If you are looking for sushi any time of the day/night. I think you will enjoy your visit as I always do. Two thumbs up for high quality fish!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because my brother was raving about it. We stopped by on a early Friday night and it was already busy. Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table and were seated in a booth close to the entrance. Our server was very nice and friendly, but was a bit slow after we placed our orders and it took her a while to get our check and give it back.

The menu is ridiculously big and when I tried to look it up online it was no where to be found, likely because it would crash the computer trying to download it. We started with the tempura appetizer - the batter wasn't crunchy and onion wasn't included, which I found odd since it's a staple tempura veggie. We each had a spicy tuna hand roll. It had lots of big pieces of tuna but the seaweed wrap wasn't crunchy either. Then we had the hamachi sashimi - the pieces were big and too thick (one of my pet peeves for sashimi). We also split a Monsters Inc roll which was good - soft shell crab with spicy tuna and unagi. Perhaps it's best to stick with rolls here."}
{"text":"This has been on my list for quite sometime and it finally worked out that I was in the area for lunch. Didn't quite see anything on the buffet I wanted so I ordered from the menu. I got 3 Maki rolls and 2 yakitori  skewers. The sushi was very fresh and the spicy tuna roll was unique. Instead of the typical spicy mayo it had a some what bbq sauce with a nice heat to it. Different but not bad in any way. The bacon wrapped scallop yakitori is damn good. Will most definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs! Great quality sushi using some unconventional ingredients in some very interesting ways. Just my kind of place."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my and most of my friends go-to places but they recently updated the menu inexplicably removing most of the items that made it unique and worth going out of the way for.  They used to have several non-seafood sushi roll options including the Spicy Chicken sushi roll and the Ginger Simmered Beef Maki roll.  Now they have nothing except various cheese sushi rolls.  I understand needing to raise the prices but that made no sense.

I was told before the Spicy Chicken sushi roll was discontinued that they might be able to still make it even though it wasn't officially on the menu.  Tonight I found out that's not the case even though they still have the Spicy Tuna roll.  

It's still alright but not different than any other sushi place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ru San's is a lot of fun -and noisy!    Be prepared to be greeted by a lot of yelling when you walk in the door - and again when you leave!  The lunch buffet hosts a fairly standard sushi line-up and is a great place for a quick, tasty lunch during the week.  For dinner, the rolls are way more creative - try the punk rock and roll (my favorite!) and the Jana Moon.  I have found ordering the chirashi at a sushi restaurant gives you a good idea of the quality of the fish, and I have to say the quality here is not the greatest.  Stick to the rolls and shy away from any sashimi other than tuna and salmon.  Would be a great restaurant to bring out of town guests to!"}
{"text":"Ru San's was hubby and I's favorite sushi spot in town for a long time (until Cowfish ousted the Ru).  Great, fresh, and you can find a lot of unusual stuff on the menu.  Tons of food for a great value.  We like to order weird stuff (I find it's easier to eat something unfamiliar if you aren't exactly sure what it is), so their big plate thingies (forget what they are called) are great for that.  Just a bunch of delicious weird stuff piled onto a huge plate.  Done.  Love the atmosphere here, too - everyone is very friendly and upbeat.  Delicious rolls too!  Final verdict:  one of the better places around to get sushi for a reasonable price.  Plus weird stuff!"}
{"text":"GOOD all you can eat lunch buffett for $13????  I was skeptical, to say the least, but happy with the products offered.  But most impressed with customer service, as everyone we saw on way out thanked us for coming...too many places fail in this dept.  Well done Ru Sans and I will be back MANY more times"}
{"text":"I eat here anytime I am in the area.  Love it.  The Firecracker roll is awe.some."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, always fresh and friendly.  Can get very packed on weekends.  Great rolls and dollar sushi.  Great place to take sushi lovers and sushi novices as there is so much to choose from.  The sushi chef Sam is my favorite."}
{"text":"We love eating the sushi lunch. Can't beat that deal and the fish is good. They are putting it out quick so it is not sitting around. I don't like buffets for that reason and I don't mind it there. I do wish they would change the type of rolls more often. Always the same ones."}
{"text":"I'm rarely in the mood for sushi, but the BF is so we stop by here every few months. With that said, on my very first visit, I was very pleased to see that they had a little section of vegetarian rolls for $2.95 each. My favorites are the spinach, kimchi, & tempura cream cheese rolls. Ru San's surprisingly has some of the best kimchi I have tasted, besides my mom's of course. It's even better than all of the Korean restaurants I've tried (I haven't tried many.. maybe 5 within the last 3 years?). The kimchi is very sour, just the way it should be!

When I don't want sushi, I just get some steamed veggie dumplings.. yum! I think each order comes with 8 but that's not enough for me so 2 orders it is! The veggie udon noodles are pretty good, but can be very oily. Agedashi tofu is ok.. it's just soft tofu in a tempura batter.. I hate soft tofu.. Also tried the mushroom yakitori.. good 'shrooms, but the sauce is sooo sweet! Blech. The fried ice cream is very good, although I don't like the artificial strawberry sauce they sometimes use to decorate it.

Service can be pretty erratic.. definitely hit or miss, which is why I knocked off a star. I also don't like that sodas are served in cans.. seriously just invest in a soda fountain. Very loud environment, great place for a group of people to hang out but not somewhere I would like to go to regularly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Go here for the lunch buffet it is amazing! Sushi is very fresh and they have really different roles. Prices are very reasonable I could eat here every week! Never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"42 piece sashimi sampler - This is a boat load of sashimi.. literally a huge boat. I would recommend against it even though it's a good deal because it includes alot of sashimi that most people are afraid of eating (e.g. Uni - looks like poo, Octopus - has tentacles, Shrimp heads - self-explanatory...)

Snow White Roll - YUM

Sushi Tart - butter on top of sushi? Excellent idea. Hard to share, but delicious.

Steak Roll (special) - Good for the unadventurous. 

Kobe Steak Appetizer - Good steak, the sauce was a little too sweet for me.

Salmon Sashimi, Rich and Famous, Yellow Tail - Always a winner

Tuna Poke, Tuna Sashimi - Always kinda... meh.

3 egg sushi - WHOA, too overwhelming. Could only eat 1.

And they also have half off bottles of wine during Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Great sushi Great atmosphere the wait is worth it Big going to this place for over 15 years consistently great Sushi"}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's son's birthday.  He wanted sushi so sushi he got.  This happens to be my guys favorite sushi place so we try to come when we're in Charlotte.  

Pricing is a bit high but they have an extensive menu from sashimi to rolls and bento boxes. 

They also have noodles and fried rice as well as dessert.  

We spent about  $160 for two adults and 2 kids.  A couple of sake and beer. 

Place does get busy on the weekends so if you plan on trying it out, go early or off hours if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of mine when visiting Charlotte.  The sushi is good (even if not great) and the prices are great as well.  The grinch roll, rich & famous roll, and kiss of fire are our favorites.  Even if something is no longer on the menu, they will still make it for you!"}
{"text":"#PokeBowl was excellent but was disappointed with a one (1) little scoop of #greenteaicecream ? What's that about? I'm a regular so I noticed right away. Kind of ruined #thefeelz"}
{"text":"Went to Ru San's with my family, for my daughter's birthday.  We couldn't have been happier, with the service and the food.  It was outstanding!  I had the PowerBuilder Sushi plate and it was just incredible."}
{"text":"Sushi buffet,  $12.50.    What more is there to say.  You cant beat that anywhere.     Always fresh.  Made while you eat"}
{"text":"Great Sushi lunch place. Fast pace buffet style Sushi but with quality choices. Regular Sushi menu is also available. Friendly staff. Very busy at lunch but because of the buffet you can be in and out in no time."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp, tried it, loved it, then a few days later, another site I follow listed it as one of the top 10 current restaurants in Charlotte.  The Kim Chi roll is fantastic.  The first visit, service could have been better (I never got my sushi roll), but the food was good, so we gave it another try.  And the food was still really great, and service was fine.  Everything I've had there has been great, they have sticky rice, and the prices are good.  Any time I'm in the area and want sushi, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"You had me at sushi. I'm a big fan of the squishy, rolly treat and tend to venture out quite often to pick up my chopsticks. The sushi is fresh, flavorful and rather cheap. I actually come by here more than other sushi places simply for the firecracker roll - I have yet to find one that beats it in Charlotte. At Ru Sans, it's huge and the ahi tuna middle is always cooked perfectly... nice and rare as it should be. 

It may sound like a crazy detail but one of the best things about Ru Sans is how tight they wrap their rolls. I've never had ingredients come dropping out, leaving me fumbling in my soy sauce to fish out and pieces and trying to rewrap it myself. 

Oh and two words for you: lunch buffet. Take an afternoon and do yourself a favor. The buffet is extensive with one 12 foot table decked out in all sushi. Head toward the back and you find another 12 foot table with soup, salad, duck wings, desserts and anything else they decide to put out. Only downside is the sushi isn't labeled so if you love a roll, good luck finding out what it is. But silver lining to that, the chefs tend to make whatever they want for the buffet, and are constantly making sushi all throughout lunch, so on each trip, you have something new and fresh waiting for you. 

The atmosphere is lively. The sushi is cheap. Definitely check it out, especially if you're new to the QC."}
{"text":"Best sushi around, hands down! The buffet is amazing, fresh and reasonably priced. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It can be loud but has a great atmosphere. My favorite is the sushi buffet. Great selection of rolls. Fish is fresh. Service is usually good. On Saturdays get there early or you will have a long wait. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Just went here for the second time last night. I went with my boyfriend and, knowing that this place gets super busy at night, we decided to go around 5pm (on a Saturday).  It was perfect timing as we beat the crowd and had our choice of sitting inside or outside on the small patio. We went with outside since the weather is so nice. We started with edamame which was a nice fresh start, little strange that they bring you a pile of salt on the plate versus salting it before it arrives but it was good none-the-less. Next, I went with one of their basic rolls that had mango and a spicy thai chili sauce on top, it was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The other roll I had was the Salmon Fresh Roll with mango and mint, wasn't sure what to expect, but it came as almost egg roll types and there were two. It was also yummy although I would've liked to taste the salmon a little more. Overall good food, nice to beat the rush and consistent service. I'm sure I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"After visiting a sushi restaurant in downtown Charlotte that did not have a lot to offer, I immediately turned to Yelp in search of something out of the ordinary and found Ru San's! It was around dinner time, the restaurant was packed and the service was fast. Ru San's menu was overwhelmingly large (no complaint), and they had a lot of interesting speciality sushi rolls. There were so many sushi rolls I have never seen in my life! I was so incredibly stoked, until I received them. I eat sushi pretty frequently, and while their rolls were very interesting, they were not very proportionate. This made the plate not only look unsatisfying, but the sushi tasted unbalanced. I looked at the neighboring tables and their sushi seemed to look a lot more appealing than mine, so I am willing to give this restaurant another try. Maybe I just got unlucky? I ordered what the waitress said was their most popular roll. I do not know but I have had better sushi!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in all of charlotte! I try to go down here at least once a month. Get the Carolina Blue sake martini and the shrimp pot stickers!"}
{"text":"This review is for the all you can eat sushi lunch.

While the sushi was continually stocked, there were not labels as to ingredients (there was a lot of I think that looks like tuna conversations going on). On top of that, there weren't designated serving utensils for each different roll; an issue that irked me because of contamination or folks with food allergies (and irked my friend who is allergic to gluten even more). The sushi wasn't bad, in fact, I was surprised at the size and quality for an all you can eat situation (I expected the quality to be of a much lower caliber). However, the sushi wasn't great either; I was disappointed that I didn't quite know what I was eating (because it wasn't properly labeled); there were far too many tempura flakes; and several rolls had this sticky, sweet (in my opinion, not tasty) barbecue type sauce on top.

I left Ru San's full (an expected all-you-can-eat and sushi combination) but I'm not sure if I would go back when there are so many other sushi places in Charlotte with, in my opinion, better sushi.

{"text":"I like this place a lot. I had a bad experience once where my order was incorrect and I was there over 2 hours arguing with the server who stated the manger was too busy to come speak to our table. It was very unpleasant. However, I have been there many other times and had a fine time. So maybe just a bad night? Food is really good. I would probably still go back because I like the food so much."}
{"text":"This is a good spot in a centrally located place in dilworth close to uptown and south end. Huge variety of sushi and non sushi dishes. Good selection of beers and always a good crowd/atmosphere. Make sure you get there early or you will wait.....but it is never a long wait. This trip we had calamari salad and ginger salad to start and my pregnant wife had a shrimp tempura and baked salmon roll where I had one of the specials that had a little of everything in it. Service was good and the quality too without costing too much. Go here it is a good spot."}
{"text":"Ah, RuSan's. There's four in ATL, and our little outpost here. CLT veggies should rejoice, and I come here when I want (a lot of) sushi, because the selection is large and in charge. There is no where else in our fair town where you sit down and actually have to think about what rolls to order - the selection of veg-friendly stuffs is that comprehensive, and they're all about creating custom rolls. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado/cuke rolls, but one does crave deviation, occasionally.

Apart from that, I've had the Yasai soba (my fiance's angry tummy can attest to the broth being fish-based, as tradition dictates), edamame, fried rice (very good, but hey, it's fried rice), a few other hot items. But it's all about the vegetable tempura roll (special order) or what I like to call the bagel - tomato, cream cheese, scallion, toasted sesame seeds, deep fried (another special order). Yeehaw."}
{"text":"Go here if you plan to go deaf while eating terrible sushi. It is obnoxiously loud, the service is terrible and the food is on par with the service.  Our waitress was running around like a jackrabbit without paying attention to anything. She messed up not one but three of our dishes (luckily we were at the bar so the guy who was making our sushi fixed it right away). The so called 'Japanese' food is made by mexicans who look to one white guy for guidance on how to make stuff. Yeah..not exactly authentic.
This was a big waste of time and money.  It gets a star because they had Sapporo beer."}
{"text":"This isn't the best sushi in Charlotte but it's pretty good. They also have a wide range of food for the non sushi lover. All in all the food is good and worth trying. The firecracker roll is probably my favorite roll here. If you're looking for something cooked but want to be adventurous try the Hamachi Kama. It's a grilled cheek of the hamachi served with a nice dipping sauce. Unfortunately the plumbing here tends to smell sometimes (at least I hope that's what it is). It's not a good combo when you're trying to enjoy raw fish. The food is good but for this reason I've knocked it down a star."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Sushi is always incredible, my favorite is the exotic. This place has a certain city life vibe as well as the time it closes gives a more downtown urban bar feel. The music is spot on and light hearted. One of the best places to go for a first date."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and each time there is a line out the door!! They do not take reservations and will not sit your party until they are all present.  The sushi is fresh and delicious.  My husband gets the Soba bowls, which are gigantic and delicious. The worst part of this restaurant is that so many people know it is so good!"}
{"text":"Ok for sushi but not the best....I have definitely had better.  The service is ok.  They do have a wide variety of rolls, I wish it was just more fresh.  They sushi pieces are big so they fall apart when you try to eat them.  As far as food quality, it is edible.  Also, they have a tendency to mess up your rolls and order, they did that to us twice.  I would not go back after being there twice."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good. Service is pretty slow but it's almost ok because it's a pretty fun environment. Lunch buffet is great. Almost impossible to call ahead to place a to-go order because they will not answer phone."}
{"text":"When you're waiting for your flight out of CLT, just finished up some drinks at Sycamore Brewing, and just need some easy sushi, you find Ru San's. This seemingly fast shopping center sushi spot yielded for high hopes, but left me feeling meh. 

My girlfriend and I got here on Sunday evening and it seemed rather empty. Despite the pretty visibly open seating, it took them a bit to seat and serve us. Now I will say, this menu is massive. They have almost two full pages is specialty rolls, so keep that in mind for this review. We went with some old reliables and stuck with spicy tuna, spider, and their OMG roll because we didn't want to be too basic. The spicy tuna, rather than being made with a tuna and spicy mayo mix, actually had chunks of tuna with this sweet BBQ sauce on it. Interesting at first bite, but not a repeat. The other two were...well they were sushi. Nothing too exciting and required some siracha on top to make it exciting. Maybe their strength lies in their speciality roles, but I will argue that you need to walk before you roll. *ba dum tss*

For slow service and mediocre sushi, I'm keeping this spot at a 3. Feel free to try out this spot if you're feeling creative because there aren't too many other great options close by. Maybe your adventurousness in sushi picking will provide you with a better experience."}
{"text":"Now that I'm living just down the street, I've started stopping into this place. Made my way over last Friday evening w/ my daughter for a quick bite. The place was packed but we got a seat right away at the bar. Huge selection of sushi. Friendly staff. I tried the Chipotle roll. Nice little kick and very tasty. Wasn't as big of a fan of the Rich and Famous roll. My daughter enjoyed her veggie rolls too. It's a little loud in there especially when the chefs start banging their knives on the counter. Not sure what that's about but it was interesting none the less. Glad this place is so close, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited on VDay...the service was horrible. I ordered my food only to watch it sit on the counter for 20 mins ...while other waitress talked over the food and passed it over because it wasn't for their assigned tables. My server finally makes it back and ask did I want them to make my food over since it was sitting on the counter for so long...ugh talk about irritated. I waited 35 minutes for a table and now wait another 20 to 30 minutes for my food again...I opted out. 

Worst service ever!!!"}
{"text":"Walk through the sweltering heat of the parking lot, listening to the cicadas hissing, i pull open the glass doors and enter Ru San's. Seems like this place plopped down from the sky in the middle of a corn field. I'm exaggerating here.

Sit down, order saki and tuna tataki and miso soup.
It's not loud like everyone says.

Waitress is rushed but easy going. Soup has spaghetti in it? Huh?
Tuna was overcooked...and not enough sauce. Overuse and abundance of daikon is compensating for quality, similar to small man buying fancy car.

Firecracker roll was delicious like a donut is delicious.
Unagi was pretty good.
Spider roll also delicious.

Kirin and a $60 dollar check for 2 stuffed middle aged people.
I wiil be back for sure because the menu is sixteen pages long."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi restaurant when I'm craving sushi but can't afford the upscale sushi restaurants that I like (i.e. check out Soul Gastrolounge). The sushi is very good for the price you pay. If you can eat a LOT of sushi, it might not end up being that cheap, but for me, this has to be the cheapest GOOD restaurant I can go to for lunch or dinner. I usually just get a couple sake nigiri, unagi nigiri, and some spicy tuna rolls, and it is under $15. I've also tried their seaweed salad. I've only had that at one other place, but both were delicious!
Here is the full menu:
http://www.allmenus.com/nc/charlotte/41903-ru-sans/menu/
CHEAP!! But it works when you're craving sushi!
Also, I must mention the waiters I've had here have all been very pleasant, and usually pretty fast even when the restaurant is busy."}
{"text":"Cousins took me to this all you can eat sushi buffet. It was remarkable! Everything was delicious, you can even get miso soup, they had spring rolls, along with making yourself a ginger salad to go with your meal. The variety of susgi they had was amazing, and their service was excellent! Would 100% go back. Plus the price was very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in town, especially vegetarian sushi. They staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the amazingly large menu The service for the sushi the last couple of times has been slower than when we first started coming but it was back to it's old speed tonight. I would give it a 4.5 only because of that minor inconsistency. The food certainly deserves a whole hearted 5-Stars.

Try the tempura cream cheese maki for a subtly sweet offering that pairs well with a sushi meal."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for sushi belly!  That feeling you get when you've eaten way too much sushi, but you feel so happy about it!  Normally I have a strict rule about eating sushi off a buffet.  Ru San's alleviates some of these concerns by  kindly placing placards stating how long each dish has been out.  They get pretty slammed for lunch, so plan on being there early.  This probably isn't the place to meet friends when you only have an hour lunch.  All in all, it's a great little place, and I always leave pretty dang happy!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is 13 dollars including tax. I feel either food is salty or blend. It's too bad, since it provides Chinese food as well. Overall, it is little below average quality in my opinion. This review only pertains to lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Ru San's for me can be a hit or miss but Friday the food was really good. I like sushi so  I may be bias to this review; nevertheless, you should read it even if you don't like sushi.

 Okay first off why isn't there half stars on here? I always ask myself that because it's rare that I'll ever give something 5 stars! 

So it was super busy! Always a good sign and sat outside and it was great. The server was quick and funny as well. I highly recommend trying something you haven't tried instead of your plain old California Roll! Boring! :/ 

Go for a Bento Box or something crazy like Eel to give your tongue something different. Yum! 
I had the Exotic Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Avocado Roll. I must say the Avocado Roll was ON POINT SON! That roll I would give 5 stars ! :D"}
{"text":"Sushi... one of my favorite! This place is pretty good. Our server was super nice and knowledgeable of the menu. They have so many different rolls that it gets so overwhelming, I just wanted one of each! The miso soup is pretty good. We had the cold sake and it was sweet but it was pretty good too. Don't remember the name of it, sorry :-/. The fish tasted fresh but the white fish was a bit too slimy. The tuna was on point and the sauce they give you with it it's delicious. They have a bar where you can sit and they have tables and booth as well. Will recommend calling and making reservations if you have 6 or more people in your party. Overall a really good place to get a sushi bite."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite spot: creative menu, personable service'; quality food. No longer. Ru San's is falling victim to its popularity. Service is rushed and so is the food quality: output over preparation. Such a shame."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi (especially for the value) in Charlotte.  Always so quick and so freakin good.  Ginger salad, tempura, yakitori, sushi, all of it!  I wouldn't recommend for a date night or if you're looking for something fancy but if you want amazing sushi at the best prices in Charlotte, Ru San's is your place."}
{"text":"The menu is completely ridiculous. I've included the link to the menu below. It's a big menu and is completely overwhelming. Since I eat sushi, I was surprised that it was overwhelming to me. For someone new to Sushi, it will be a lot.

http://www.allmenus.com/nc/charlotte/41903-ru-sans/menu/

Aside from the menu, the sushi is great and the prices are reasonable. I had TEMPURA JAPANESE BAGEL MAKI and tempura battered scallops and sweet potatoes. It was all very good and wonderful. 

The service was poor at best. We waited a long time for our drinks, our orders to be taken, our food to come, our dessert, our check. It was a lot of waiting going on so if you're in a hurry, this isn't the place to go. I would have given it four stars because the food really was good but the service was terrible.

I'd go back only for carryout. Maybe I'd even try the buffet lunch."}
{"text":"Great buffet.  Amazing to be honest for $11.09. I bought my first beer as a 16 year old here back in 1998 before the bastards at ALE busted these fine folks. Great for parties and birthdays to those of drinking age. Sake bomb races are epic here. Just stick to the main menu. Had explosive diarrhea from here more than once by ordering oddball stuff off the extensive menu. Too much on the menu to keep it all fresh I guess."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is what it's all about at Ru San's, although they do offer a regular dinner service that's also good. Said buffet can be crowded, so be prepared to put your patience to the test as people forget how lines work. That's certainly not the fault of Ru San's, though. Things move pretty fast in this place and the attentive servers keep the buffet fully stocked with fresh platters.

This isn't traditional sushi and sashimi, but I love their creative approach. It tastes good and there's a fair amount of variety. If you have little to no experience with sushi, here's your introduction. My personal favorites are anything involving eel, asparagus, avocado, or tuna.

Try the cucumber salad and the fried calamari, if you go to the buffet."}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying Ru San's based on a friend's recommendation. We got there around 8pm on a Saturday night and it was understandably busy. The host told us it would be about 30-45mins so we stopped by next door to have a drink. We come back and the host VERY rudely tells us \"we already called you. Where did you go?\" we explained that we went next door for a drink and he scribbles our name on a list and says it'll probably be another 15 minutes now. We asked that since we missed our name being called does that mean we just lose our spot? He then responds with \"Didn't you see that I wrote your name down on the list? It's right there\" RUDE. SO rude. Obviously we were annoyed at this point and were talking about him outside and he flags us to say there is a table (literally a minute after we walk back outside). We sit and here comes the host again and he literally throws the soy sauce bowls, napkins and silverware on the table without saying anything and walks away. UGH. If I decided to base my review on this guy alone I would have given this place a 1 star.

BUT.. The food was very delicious. Everything we ordered we had no complaints about. The waitress and other staff were friendly. Their sushi, seaweed salad, kimchi salad, everything was hitting the spot. I will probably be back for the food alone but you guys should seriously get rid of that miserable man you have there working the front because if it weren't for him I would have given you guys a 5 star."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is amazing! This is the only place I'll eat a sushi buffet. The sushi always tastes fresh, and there are always a variety to choose from. You gotta also try the fried green beans!"}
{"text":"Garlic veggie noodles, spicy shrimp fried rice, sushi - favorites! Visit all the time and love it! Can get loud but great atmosphere and engaged staff! Some Outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I don't get the allure of this place? Had a sushi craving and figured I would stop in early before the place got super crowded based on yelp reviews it gets crazy. My Yelp comrades were not lying, the place opens at 11:30 by 11:50 the place was packed. First thing that rubbed me the wrong way, the hostess had an attitude. She tried to sit me at the bar, I requested I be placed at a small table instead. However, before she would let me finish my request she quips I can't have a booth as I am a party of one. Ok...great...if you would let me finish my sentence you would know I wasn't requesting a booth (I get y'all get packed and need the seats). Strike 1. 

Strike 2... the layout of the place is awful for a sushi buffet I mean people were crashing into each other trying to get around to the sushi or their respective tables. I'm sure they can figure out how to reorganize the interior to make it a bit more logical in terms of the layout. I found it very stressful to navigate around servers, staff, and guests. 

Strike 3...the sushi pretty much was awful. There were no labels telling you what type of fish was in each roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried and filled with cream cheese or covered in mayo. A few of the nigiri pieces were decent with seared tuna being an option at one point. Would it really be that hard to over some sushi that isn't deep fried or covered in mayo/cream cheese. Also, isn't it a health code violation to not label the food being served? Seems like a big risk to take given how litigious Americans are and the prevalence of food allergies. 

Skip Ru San's and go to Mr. Tokyo - you know exactly what you are getting, the staff is friendly, and you can skip the anxiety inducing procedure to get sushi as you order as you go."}
{"text":"Affordable, amazing sushi. I went on a Friday with a party of 8 thinking I was doomed and we were seated in 25 mins. Very impressive. My out of town friends loved this neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"I have absolute nothing bad to say about this place. I have been going here since my freshman year of college (cause we are all on a budget during this time) and have not turned away. I love going during lunch, there $12 lunch buffet is amazing! Fresh sushi along with other things such as miso soup, spring rolls, fried chicken and other foods (keep in mind this is a sushi restaurant so there are very little options for food that isn't sushi, unless you go for dinner) I have brought so may friends and family here and they all have left satisfied with the food and price. I typically stay away from buffets because the food tends to taste, cheap and microwaved? if thats a description, but this place has fresh food that does'nt hurt the wallet."}
{"text":"I would always go in to get to go orders, today I decided to do the lunch buffet. 
So worth it."}
{"text":"As I roll over the 4 star rating, Yelp tells me that this implies \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" Well, that's accurate. You go, Ru San's.
It's true, it's not the best sushi in Charlotte. True, it's not the cheapest sushi in Charlotte. But dammit, I just keep coming back. The atmosphere is always lively, the food is never bad, there's always a great combination of creative rolls and a HUGE menu.

I couldn't even tell you my favorite, because odds are it won't be on the menu by the time you read this and go there.

Service is nothing spectacular, but I've never been left alone for an unreasonable amount of time. All of this together in a great location kind of warrants multiple return trips, and I'll continue doing it until they have three strikes. Right now, they have zero. Well done, Ru San's."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 11 years, so I'm picky about sushi. While all their crazy rolls are very non-traditional, they are creative and delicious. Go for the lunch buffet, but get there early! My favorite thing to do is, after a haircut at Salon 42 (next door), I sit at the counter and sip on a Kirin while I wait for my \"to go\" order. I love that you can watch them making everything, too. Limited outdoor seating is covered, but not very special since it faces the parking lot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and really enjoyed my experience.  My waiter was a little too perky which made for interesting interactions with him.  I wouldn't say this is high quality sushi, but dinner here might go in that direction.  For lunch I got the buffet and for the price I paid the quality, selection, and taste was well worth the cost."}
{"text":"Ru Sans has the best sushi in Charlotte. This place is always busy but you never wait more than 10 minutes for a table. 

I love watching everyone do sake bombs. The chefs get into it and make lots of noise along with everyone else around the bar.

The menu here is extensive. Sushi, ramen, rice bowls, and so much more. When eating at Ru Sans you can close your eyes, flip to a page, and point to find a great order.

I don't come eat here often enough!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on Saturday night, food is good. Unfortunately the kitchen staff is very disrespectful to my 2 female friends to the point that i have to stop it myself. My female friends were so embarrassed that we eat at the patio, not even going back to use the restrooms. So if you go to this place be aware of the kitchen staff that are used to disrespect women with words and looking like horny dogs to your wife and in your face! Enjoy your sushi.."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with great prices. It's fun when someone does a saki-bomb...the whole bar and staff get in on that!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite sushi place. Friendly staff, the sushi chefs are always super energetic and the sushi is always amazing. Prices are great and has the largest specialty menu Ive ever seen! Plus the sushi buffet at lunch is great. Ive never been a buffet person especially when it comes to sushi, but its not your typical buffet sushi. Its fresh and has unique rolls as well!"}
{"text":"Okay sushi. Nice environment. Ordered green dragon, candy crush and twice cooked.salmon roll. Not a fan for candy crush roll, like the other two."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in Charlotte....loud and rowdy but the food is outstanding. Eddie the manager is awesome...always finds a place for me even when they are packed...You can't go wrong at Rusan's..Charles H. Jones"}
{"text":"Maybe in Charlotte it's worth paying a bit more for decent sushi. I ordered a few Maki- nothing fancy, very simple: should be a slam dunk to get right. Not the case: the Umi was too much, it tasted like taking a bite into a chunk of salt and the Salmon roll was full of wasabi- every piece I bit into brought me closer to tears as my sinuses felt the burn. I absolutely could not taste or enjoy the fish. Bringing me to my final roll, the Yellowtail. All I could taste was rice. Not sure if this was due to my burned taste buds from the Umi and Salmon, or just because their fish is no good. I don't plan to return and find out."}
{"text":"These guys are experts, they know their Sushi and do it well. Always a line for lunch and Dinner but it moves fairly fast as they just pump out meal after meal. Never a big rush, everyone is friendly and this is an Icon for Sushi in Charlotte. Try the 7 Samurai roll and enjoy Sake or Wine both at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to leave a review for Ru Sans for the longest time and I have finally come to it. I've been going to Ru Sans for as long as I can remember it is one of THE BEST places in the Queen City to get sushi. The rolls are amazing and that is what I go for the sashimi is good too and is always very fresh but I found another place called Yama's that has more exotic sashimi and for eating sushi as long as I have I would have to say the more \"experienced\" sushi people that want some exotic sashimi, notice how I am saying sashimi, should go there. Their rolls are good too but Ru Sans rolls are better. Most of their rolls are very and I mean very flavorful the sauces they use are amazing and the service is very friendly. A lot of times you can catch the owner working alongside the employees and that's pretty cool. He is very friendly as well and hooks us up due to our frequency of visits. If all you're interested in is rolls or you're a beginner to sushi come to Ru Sans because they are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Um where do I even start? I'm here like every other week. My fianc√© and I freaking love this place. My favorite dishes would be the firecracker roll, tuna tataki, and the any fried rice dishes. Don't wait and go now you loser"}
{"text":"Why was I a Ru San's virgin for so long?  I stopped in with a friend the other night for a quick bite.  It was packed for a Monday night so I thought that was a good sign.  I immediately noticed their outdoor/covered patio and quite a few fellow patrons were enjoying the cool summer night. 

We were seated quickly and I'm glad I had my friend, a Ru San's regular, to help navigate through the enormous menu.  We just wanted a lite bite so started with the always standard house salad/ginger dressing.  It was good.  We ordered the \"Grinch\" and  the \"America re-rising\" roll.  Both of them were well done, presentation was excellent and they were very fresh.  

They had some great sushi options...something for all levels of sushi eaters.  Veggie options, cooked options, fried options, a variety of fish, etc.  They were excellent.

The service was a little slow..or I think our waiter forgot about us at one point, but it was fine.  We weren't in a hurry.   There were plenty of other yummy options to try so I will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"After multiple horror stories of having to postpone post-dinner plans and two hour waits for food, I stick to the lunch at Ru San's, and lately just the lunch buffet. I usually try to plan on meeting around 1:30, not as busy, better selection, and a lot of times better quality rolls. but, sometimes I end up at ru san's at noon  with everyone else. the rolls go fast, sometimes dishes stay empty for what seems like forever (last trip a friend just wanted some chicken and broccoli, it sat unreplenished for almost ten minutes - which is a long time during a lunch hour) and at peak times there are a lot of filler duplicates (a plate full of basic tuna rolls next to another plate full of basic tuna rolls covered in sriracha). 

but, I get to have my ginger salad, cucumber seaweed salad, a few hot entrees, some nigiri, and my pick of a decent variety of freshly made (and with the way people file through here I assume with relatively fresh ingredients) sushi for $10... even if they decide to smother, cover, and top half the plates with sauces. added bonus (only because of what i've seen at other sushi buffets in town) you can actually identify what's in your roll. no really random filler, and almost all the rolls have fish in them. they even put out a random goliath tempura battered one (you know, the kind that are a test to your sushi eating and mouth widening abilities)

as for service at lunch, they almost always expect you to go to the buffet. the service has been fine when I don't get the buffet, but nothing spectacular. (and the rolls i've ordered off the menu have not disappointed) as far as keeping waters filled, they're usually on top of it. 

so go, enjoy mediocre sushi for cheap, and if you're lucky maybe a few people will start sake bombing. (it can be fairly entertaining here)"}
{"text":"Fresh and affordable with plenty of delicious options to choose from! The sushi and noodle bowl were delicious"}
{"text":"I live in Atlanta and I know my sushi and this place rocks. Great food great staff and a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in Charlotte. Incredible menu with great prices."}
{"text":"Despite the pumping techno throughout dinner, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The lobster tempura with mango roll on special was one of the best I've ever had. The prices are ridiculously low, service is attentive, and food is delicious. I thought the fish was great, not sure how much fresher previous reviewers are looking for. The environment is super noisy but I am definitely willing to overlook that for good prices. Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I am definitely a sushi fan and continue to check out sushi spots in Charlotte, because they definitely all have their own perks!

I have been going to Ru San's for almost 10 years now, but definitely feel like the service and quality of food has improved over the years.  Ru San's offers a great environment, sushi chefs welcome you, staff running around servers tables, bright lights, TVs, and always a large amount of other diners. With all of that going on know this is not a quiet restaurant. Be prepared to speak a little louder than you normally do, ha ha!
As for the food, Ru San's offers something for everyone: sushi, ramem, tempura, yakitori, asian entrees, desserts, beer, wine and saki. So much to choose, and the menu can be overwhelming.
I typically stick to sushi as I think they do a decent job and are reasonably priced compared to some others places in the area. To start, don't miss out on the ginger salad, a fresh iceberg lettuce salad with carrots, radishes and a light ginger dressing, and miso...one of my favorites. Always piping out and they sure fill your bowl.
Overall Ru San's is a great spot to check out on a weeknight, to miss the large crowds or a weekend to enjoy the loud fun, but as I mentioned and others, be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi bar for lunch is the best one in Charlotte.  The fish is fresh, the miso is delicious, and the atmosphere is loud and overwhelming.

Rusan's has been a staple in Charlotte for years, and it's easy to see why.  Walking into the place you're greeted with loud sushi chefs yelling at each other in Japanese a bustling crowd - a tell tale sign of fresh ingredients - and tons of fresh fish.

One surprising gem to look out for is the art on the walls.  Really nice stylized modern work by Rusan - I'm assuming to be the owner of the joint.  Who knew the guy could not only put together a sweet sushi place, but slap some paint on a canvas??

The best value they offer, as I mentioned earlier, is the lunch buffet.  For around $11 after tip you can bank on the fact that you'll be so full and groggy at 2:30pm, you'll have to leave the office or get a cup of coffee.  Don't forget to grab one of those bite sized pieces of cake at the end of the bar for dessert - really good!"}
{"text":"One of the busiest sushi places in Charlotte for sure. I'm there on weekly basis, as I'm a sushi lover. They have excellent sushi and always fresh with a very friendly staff. A lot of options to choose from and try every time. It's a busy place if you want a calm place for a romantic dinner that's definitely not your destination."}
{"text":"omg! i love this place after six yrs is still my fav place to have sushi!! they're always busy, but is alright i dont mind i just love their sushi!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because it's within walking distance of my apartment, and am so glad I did! The seafood ramen dish was absolutely delicious and so flavorful - the best ramen I've had. We had the sushi rolls that our waitress recommended (tootsie and firey dragon) and enjoyed both as well, although it didn't look the absolute freshest (hence the 4 stars), tasted great. All super reasonable prices, including drinks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place offered good sushi with friendly customer service. My only issue was witnessing one of the cooks sneeze behind the sushi bar and not wash his hands. One of our tables were a little dirty but we looked over it.

Lastly, they charged an 18% gratuity on a party of 6 and didn't disclose this in the beginning.

Nevertheless, they made up for it by bringing a birthday dessert to our table and singing happy birthday."}
{"text":"Ru San's is my old standby for sushi.  In fact after last night I just realized I haven't \"yelped\" this place yet.  With all the new fancy places (burgsushi? Owner performs song & dance?), nothing beats solid and affordable.  I honestly think Ru San's started the hip sushi movement in Charlotte.  

My favorite thing here is the $1 menu.  And unlike other $1 menu sushi places, Ru San's has options.  Here are some of my regular items: Cajun Maki, Lomi Lomi Salmon, Rock & Roll ($1.50), Bay Shrimp Salad Maki, Spicy Aioli Scallop Maki, Seared Salmon Nigiri, Teriyaki Eggplant Maki... also the Tofu Yakitori is great, as well as Salmon Tempura.  I often walk out of here with a fully belly for under $10.  

I personally avoid the lunch buffet but I know plenty of people swear by it.  No offense, I much rather enjoy my sushi that looks like sushi and not sushi shape rice falling apart creations.  

No matter how cool other places people say they are, Ru San's always have a spot on my dining list."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Ru San's for years. Today for lunch was absolutely TERRIBLE. Sushi was bad and the service was not the best either. I love Ru San's with all my heart but I am extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant due to yelp publicity of it. Eh, -- I wont be going back. 
, 
Firstly, there was a long line outside for lunch..My first thought- man, must be good. My second thought should have been ' or must be cheap'. .

I think this buffet caters to people that like quantity over quality. Given my Asain background, I suppose I am somewhat of a  sushi snob. The sushi rolls just have drizzled sauces..making them 'look pretty' without the taste. Was NOT quality rolls. I was sorely dissapointed..

Also, anyone that does not consume raw fish will be dissapointed as well (as my companion to lunch had a difficult time eating well)..Thier hot plate selection was subpar and limited... I would have even prefered a typical chinese buffet to this. 

The other main point is that the customer service was poor. Hostess was short with everyone. The place was soo packed, like sardines and only 2 small buffet tables for all of these people..I felt like a vulture, having to eye my prey of food and grab it before someone else did...It was seriously that packed/overcrowded and stressful. 

No thank you...I willl prefer to pay double the price for a relaxing, quality meal."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in town! I initially started going here for the great sushi buffet but even with it being a buffet, they provide tasty rolls that are actually big! Service is reliable and you always see the same faces when you go. The lunch buffet is such a good deal and it's a great laid back atmosphere. However, I will say do not go towards the end of the buffet....you risk getting all the fried rolls that were not eaten by the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sushi for lunch without spending a small fortune, this is the place!! All you can eat for around $12!! Sometimes it's hard to get in unless you get there right when they open. It's the only place I go for sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! If u want some delicious sushi that's also an art palate to the eye this is the place. Oh yeah the fried ice cream is the best!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ru San's regularly for the past year and a half since I moved to Charlotte.  They have a good selection of vegetarian/vegan options, and a massive sushi list.  I would recommend the tempura veggie maki and the delicious veggie dumplings.  The ambiance is also pretty fun. It can get busy on the weekends, so be prepared for at least a 20 minute wait. But in my opinion, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Practically an institution, I've been to Ru-San's at least a dozen times, always for lunch. The self-serve buffet of sushi isn't the absolute best quality, but there are usually a few good finds. They usually have salmon or tuna sushi as well as several of their creative and innovative rolls. At least half are fried, which is always an interesting option. This is, after all, the South. :-)

You can easily avoid the fried stuff and focus on the raw fish. Plenty of options, even on the slower days, the stuff doesn't sit out there for long. On the back table (you didn't know there were two?) are usually a steam tray with lo mein and egg rolls and sometimes fried chicken drumsticks and wings. I've spotted big trays of tuna and salmon sashimi there on occasion.

You can't beat the price. $10 with water or $12 if you get a soda. That's a deal and a half!

I love it. One of these days, I'll have to return for dinner."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely spectacular place for sushi and a lot of fun and interaction with other guests. They have an extremely broad menu. Are usually can go on and on and on about my reviews on restaurants, but I have one word for this restaurant \"AMAZING\"!!!!
As usual, I checked out their bathrooms, and they are very clean.
If you've never been there, be ready for a very big greeting when you walk in the door. The service spectacular the value for your dollar is incredible and if I just kept going on about how good their food as I would simply be rambling. I'm hoping they're open on Christmas Day!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first say, you will NOT be disappointed with the menu or the food here. That is definitely why this joint is always hopping, and why I find myself back here from time to time. The problem I've had here on many occasions is the service.
Right from the start, the host guy conveys \"I'm miserable and hate my job.\" I heard someone else complaining about the host on the way out. The servers are mostly running around doing the bare minimum to get you in and out quickly. 
The chefs/cooks and the food are GREAT! It's unfortunate with the amount of business they do here the wait staff and host don't do this place justice."}
{"text":"Where do you go for cheap sushi? Ru San's. Ask anybody.

I appreciate the large selection of vegetarian rolls and tofu entr√©es. There's an outdoor patio area that is perfect for pleasant summer evenings. 

The beer selection is nothing too crazy. Servers are genuine and helpful.

Why three stars? It's just not AMAZING. It's fine for what it is, and all of Charlotte seems to know about it."}
{"text":"This place feels like a diner that serves sushi.  Which is a really cool vibe, don't get me wrong.  The simple, cheap tables and decor probably just let them keep the prices rock bottom (which they are).  The quality of the lunch buffet fits this analogy perfectly too.  It is like Going to Old Country Buffet and shelling out ten bucks to have all the mediocre but incredibly varietous sushi you would like.  The spread really is incredible. From the sushi to the side dishes to the desserts (which are pretty crummy), I often find myself wandering aimlessly from table to table processing a fierce internal argument about what should-or shouldnt-go on my plate.  This is probably why I made it back to home base with a gigantic mound of sushi and rice.

Not to say Rusan'sis bad or good, it's a unique, $10 sushi experience.  Lots of variety, little flavor, and a unique atmosphere (for a sushi place).  It's also a zoo around lunch time, so they must be doing something right.  I only give this place two stars but I have been twice and would certainly go again if someone invited me.  It's just not that good compared to all the other sushi options I have experienced in Charlotte.  In this case at least, you get what you pay for.  So go ahead and grab as much of it as you can."}
{"text":"Two words...sushi Buffet!! No need to worry. Their staff tends to the buffet area so it's clean and fresh sushi is coming out at least every 20 minutes or as needed. The only down side, nothing is labeled. So you may have to ask a staff member or your waiter what you're eating if that's a concern of yours. If sushi isn't your thing, they also have another portion of the buffet that includes wings, fried rice, calamari, miso soup, and cake for dessert. $12.50 for all you can eat. Not too bad."}
{"text":"I dined at Ru San's last night. This restaurant does not have the fanciest atmosphere. However, the prices are great, and the sushi was well made and truly outstanding. The fun, friendly staff made the meal all the better. I certainly will recommend Ru San's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet. The food was fresh and the service was good. Lots of choices even for the non sushi eater. Most of the food is labeled even has the time out of the kitchen! Great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant again and were not nearly as impressed. The kitchen was super slow and my roll just wasn't that great. I think we'll probably find a new sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been  going to Rusans for 6 years and have tried about every other sushi bar in town. Rusans is my favorite. I go for dinner with my wife on Friday nights around 9 pm. we can get a spot at the sushi bar and know all the chiefs. my favorite are spicy scallop hand rolls, torro hand rolls. all thte different special rolls and nigiri. they also have good Korean Kimchee, it goes well with sliced tuna or octopus. The prices are good the suhi chiefs are great and the owners are wonderful

Thank you Hata and Kim!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what flare! They definitely have the decor and fun atmosphere down!! Plus soon many cooks - makes the orders come out pretty quick even on a busy busy night. Took a bit of time to get seated & there really is no where indoors to try to wait, other than the bar. The edamame is self-seasoned, as in you dip them yourself, good but not quite my style. The sushi rolls though are tasty!!

The best tip about this place: the bar wraps all the way around - as in an entire \"U\" shaped seating area to watch all the cooking!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ru San's many times, but lately they've gone down hill. Friday night was the last straw.

Ordered two appetizers (Calamari & Tuna Tartare), 1 Rock & Roll (Unagi & Avocado),  and three Yakiudons (two spicy and one very stringently requested with no peppers or spices). 

Calamari comes out. It's delicious. 

Yakiudon comes out piping hot, but all spicy. One gets sent back to be corrected and comes back lukewarm. It was obviously rinsed off under cold water. 

Notice I didn't say the tuna tartare appetizer came out. It finally came out 20 minutes after our main course. The entire time, one of my friends sat there picking at cold calamari because we couldn't get a waiter to take his dish back and actually fix it.

When the tuna tartare arrives, it's great, but we let our hungry friend eat most of it. The  incorrect dish was never fixed, but was removed from the bill.

Speaking of the bill, my sushi arrived with it. Seriously, my Rock & Roll came sitting on top of the tray with the check and an ink pen rolling around beside. At a sushi bar, sushi was basically an afterthought. 

The food was good as always (except for the uncorrected mistakes) and I'm used to the crowds and the noise. The service however has really started leaving something to be desired. It will probably be a long time before I go back and I hope they can fix it. 

It's not like when RuSan's arrived in Charlotte... there are other (better) places to get sushi now."}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss kind of place my first time was amazing....the second time my friend thought it was amazing I was not so impressed...the third time we both were disappointed...not sure if it is worth a forth...I have to say the tuna is very good however life is more than tuna!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for dinner and I like the place a lot.  Maybe it's not the best sushi, but the value you get on the price is amazing.  Don't fall for their Titanic roll.  Supposedly you can find a treasure which turns into a gift certificate, but it's not a tasty roll.
I recommend the Midnight Club roll and the Volcano roll.  Both are excellent.  Also, try the teriyaki ball.  Get some yakitori/tempura/maki rolls for $1-3 each.  End up with a full stomach after spending around $20.
The best way to order is family style where everyone shares.  That way you don't end up eating a whole roll you don't like and have more variety.  Honestly, both times I ordered so much food, and never spent more than $30-35 after tip.
Also, it's a nice looking restaurant with a pretty fancy decor, but it's a casual atmosphere, although I hear on the weekends it's pretty bumpin."}
{"text":"For my fianc√© and I, we love this place! I have never eaten anything here that I didn't like, nor has anyone I've come here with. A few items I recommend trying are the (Apps) Grilled Teriyaki Rice Ball or Gyoza and for Sushi rolls the Rising Sun Maki is my absolute favorite but, the other rolls I have tried have always been delicious too! They also serve noodle bowls that taste like fancy ramen, but are quite yummy! 
I've never had a bad experience with the service, so I can't complain in that department either. All in all, I definitely recommend Ru Sans and intend to keep coming back to enjoy some of the best sushi in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Very similar to what Ayumi W. said, I tried the chirashi bowl and it was mediocre at best. I had been craving fresh sashimi all day and my favorite dish to satisfy my fishy cravings is a chirashi. So, I was obviously very excited when we called ahead to double check that they had this on the menu and quickly drove on over when we got the good news. There was a 15 minute wait (not bad for a Saturday evening) and we were seated by a pleasant host. However, once we were seated, it took a good 8-10 minutes before someone came and greeted us. This is absurd. It wasn't that busy, and by that point we had already flagged a different server down and asked him if he knew who our server was supposed to be. He kindly had someone he was training bring us two cups of water. The girl who eventually came wasn't pleasant or cheerful. Nothing special about her and definitely didn't seem to be trying to make up for the fact that she took forever and a day to greet us. Whatever. I came for chirashi so this was all easy to look past. We placed our order and decided to get an appetizer just in case the food took a while to come out. The pork gyoza we ordered came pretty quickly and was tasty. The sauce it comes with was also super salty (which I like) and yummy, but to my disdain, THEY CHARGE FOR EXTRA. I never understand why restaurants charge extra for a dang DIPPING SAUCE! It wasn't even a large portion. I could understand if it were steeped in saffron or something but this was definitely some basic soy sauce and chili pepper concoction. Also not impressed with the fact that my friend's sake bomb came in a plastic soda cup. Who even does that. This place serves cocktails and you can't even put the beer in a glass???? Okay, now finally to the chirashi. It looked pretty sloppily put together at first sight. The sea bass--okay. The salmon--okay but tasted a little off. The tuna--okay but tasted a little off. The tako--nope. The ikura--nope. The scallop--okay. The fake crab---probably the best thing in there, WHICH IS SAD. The seaweed salad--tasted fine, just like all the other seaweed salad I've ever had. The eel--this was yummy, but there was A TINY LITTLE SINGLE PIECE OF IT. WHY! The tamago--decent, but I feel like the egg mixture should have been mixed more--not used to seeing the white of the egg still largely spread throughout the mixture. The squid--can't really comment on this because I never really like squid sashimi. The red snapper--tough. WHY. Then there was another white fish that I cannot identify; it literally must have been the scraps because it was SUPER tough and looked like they dumped a measly little end piece on there. The other decent stuff in there was the seafood salad (can't remember what it's called, pretty sure it is calamari salad--always placed right next to the wakame). I definitely question the freshness of the ingredients. It was no good and I left very disappointed in my meal. I think Ru San's may be better for their rolls--can't say for sure though as I've never tried them. One lady did say to me while we were initially waiting to be seated that she loved her meal and order the Grinch Roll...so maybe try that while it's the season. Otherwise, DO NOT TRY THE CHIRASHI!!! So mediocre."}
{"text":"This place seems overrated by yelpers because the food is very Americanized. They try to stuff you up by deep frying the sushi and stuffing it with cream cheese. The service had no room to be terrible because it was very minimal. The waiter never got to us so we had to ask two random waiters there twice for drinks. No greeting or good bye. 

I do like how the sushi is very fresh and it's cheap."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in the city. Casual, comfortable, open late night, and a great place to take a baby for 10pm  sushi when guest come to town."}
{"text":"This is the best priced sushi I have had in a while.While this may not be the best sushi you have ever had, it's worth a trip. Always busy, you may not get a quiet and or romantic dinner atmosphere. I have been a few times now and the staff is always friendly, fast and helpful. This is a great place to grab a well priced sushi meal. The mojito sake drink is refreshing and the west wood roll and ring of fire are delish. Expect to wait for a table, but you will be happy with your meal."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for dinner, but their lunch sushi buffet is very fun and very filling.  Sometimes it does get so busy that some of the sushi put out is gone in seconds, but you just have to time your trips to the bar accordingly - and also size up the competition on the other tables [nothing that a flying elbow to the face couldn't fix - j/k].

With other sushi places opening up in Charlotte, it will be interesting to see how Ru San's stacks up against the newbies to the QC."}
{"text":"I've lived near Ru San's for 9 years and only recently have I started coming here.  What the heck was wrong with me?

It's a fun place.  I enjoy sitting in front of the sushi chefs and watching them work.  There are also several booths around the restaurant if you like that sort of thing.

The menu is extensive with sushi options as well as japanese dinner specialties.  I am always craving something spicy and the firecracker roll is one of my favorites.  Also the Firecracker shrimp appetizer is great as well.

I've found the wait staff to be hit or miss but the sushi chefs are friendly.   

There are two flaws here.  One it's two loud an two, I think they are a bit pricy.  But the food is wonderful.  I think I found my regular sushi place."}
{"text":"One of my friends introduced me to Ru San's. The first time that I went it was lunchtime and we got the lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is delicious and lots of hot options, tons of great sushi rolls, and even dessert! All of the food was great. My only complaint is that they do not have a \"permanent\" buffet area. So they set it up and break it down each day. So when you go into the restaurant you can tell that it wasn't necessarily designed to have the buffet. The spacing and set up is a little bit awkward. 

The last time I went with my friend we got the soft shell crab appetizer! It was out of this world! I would highly recommend ordering it if you like tempura soft shell crab. 

For our entrees my friend got a sashimi rice bowl that had tons of different items on it. It had a great variety. You definitely get your moneys worth when you order that dish. I got two rolls - one was from their specials menu and the other was on the regular menu. Both of them were good. One was a chipotle roll - I didn't like how it had like a dry seasoning sprinkled on it that you could feel the gritty texture of in your mouth. 

The service the night we went was HORRENDOUS. After being seating it was probably about 5-10 minutes until the waiter came up to us and go our drink orders. Then it was about 5 mins for our drinks to come. Then he delivered our drinks and walked away from us even though we were ready to order. He disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. We placed our order. My friends entree came first. Then a few minutes later my rolls came. Then last to arrive was the APPETIZER! The guy was nice - but the service was a joke. I am basically giving them a higher rating because I love the food here. I also like the atmosphere of the restaurant - they play good music!"}
{"text":"I waited a while to write this review, so that I could at least try it more than once before giving my opinion.

Many people rave about Ru San, but I'm afraid I don't share the same enthusiasm about this place.  I think if you go in with the mindset of having some fun non-traditional sushi and having lots of alcohol,  you'll have a good time.  For me, I think I can appreciate semi-Americanized sushi, specialty rolls, etc. but Ru-San's didn't quite hit the mark.

I do enjoy the concept of their $1 sushi menu, buried within their vast menu; it's a great way to get a feel for their style, sort of tapas style.  Their Ceviche is good as is their Rock and Roll (or something like that).  I love that it's cheap, small portions, and kind of no-commitment (if you don't like it, hey it was only a buck).  The teriyaki rice ball is a crispy rice ball with rich teriyaki sauce and is pretty tasty, more in an appetizer/dessert sort of way.

If you veer off the $1 items, Ru-San's falls short.  While I respect that someone said the Firecracker Roll is \"delicious like a donut,\" that is only true if donuts taste like a$$ (I say this not to be mean, but purely to make a point).  I have to warn the rest of you.  I love donuts, but I did not love the Firecracker Roll.  It is deep fried where the fish becomes tasteless and then they douse it in red chili sauce that is absolutely overpowering, unappetizing looking and I am reduced to a one-syllable adjective - yuck.  Sometimes a child's vocabulary describes it best.  It's not the heat, (there wasn't much heat) it's the taste that turned me off.  It's like they took a good steak, cooked it well-done and slathered it in A1 steak sauce.  I wanted to rinse my mouth out with sake.  I just don't get the appeal of the Firecracker Roll.  

Unlike the others, I thought the service was good.  No complaints from me on that front.  

I think it's a fine place for a non-traditional sushi lover, but I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"The sushi buffet is THE BEST!! I have a mild allergy to avocado and I still find plenty of rolls/food to eat. The buffet definitely gets the bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"The wait was long, the service was slow and forgetful, and the food was gross and made us sick. I know people love this place, but I won't be back anytime soon. I also didn't appreciate that they didn't enforce the no smoking (signs were everywhere). Wait staff saw people smoking all around us and didn't say anything. Overall a really bad night."}
{"text":"I don't understand when people tell me they love Ru Sans. The sushi is just ok... Nothing Special. 80% of the menu is deep fried. Ick.

Not saying I would never go here again but there are SOOOOO many better places!"}
{"text":"This place is not only a good sushi joint, but nonstop fun as well.  In the 4 years I lived in CLT this was one of those places I kept coming back to.  

You have a great dollar sushi menu (try the fried garlic maki), allowing you to sample a wide variety of flavors without breaking the bank.  During the week there's a killer buffet that's always mobbed.  Go early or late to avoid the rush.  Even at the end they're still on top of refreshing the buffet. 

Dinner there is always good.  If you decide to do a sake-bomb the entire restaurant cheers you on.  The plum sake if delicious if you want a little sweet in your alcohol.  The tempura is great with a light minimally greasy batter.  Green tea ice cream is a perfect finishing move.

The entire staff (even the chefs) is friendly and attentive.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  My girl and I became regulars early on.

The one bad thing about restaurants in Charlotte is that you have to be told about the good ones.  You really can't drive down a road and \"stumble\" upon it.  Thankfully our Charlotte \"connection\" let us in on the Ru San's secret when we first moved there.

Fun, relaxed atmosphere.  Delicious food with a huge selection.  Incredible artwork (made by the owner himself) hanging on the walls.  What more do I have to say?  Get your ass over to Ru San's and have a sake-bomb for me ;)"}
{"text":"Only twice hv I had the luck of having either the owner or a pro sushi chef serve me here. 

Last night we ate there to celebrate a special birthday. I mentioned to the waiter twice about it thinking maybe an acknowledgement by the establishment would bring a cheer or a candle on one of the birthday boy's sushi. Nada. 

Fortunately the jittery waiter seemed eager to please which diffused chuckles around the table. 

Our birthday boy ordered the Sushi & Assorted Sashimi dinner which the waiter  mistakenly ordered the Assorted Sashimi Dinner only.  Two ordered the Tekka Don which tuna sashimi was cut very very thinly on top of mounds of rice.   How can you taste the fishiness with it being so paper thin? We could see the rice through the sashimi!!! 

No pro sushi or experienced Japanese cuisine chef there last night. Many foreign \"workers\" behind the sushi bar...sure they will verbally welcome you and thank you for being patrons which is a fun thing BUT if you're paying $$$, not $$, you should expect what you pay for, right? A well run sushi bar doesn't need ten+ guys. That's where my full slices of Tekka Don tuna went...to their paychecks and not to my tummy. 

Granted, the mounds of quality sushi rice was perfectly cooked and prepared but we didn't go there just for the rice! We had a birthday boy and a visiting sister from Seattle...how disappointing. Zannen zannen! 

Hopefully Ru-San will read this and re-evaluate. Please take this seriously for your business' sake."}
