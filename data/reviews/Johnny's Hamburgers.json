{"text":"1. Burger - $3.05 Big burger bun, patty is pre-made from a manufacturer. Condiments and toppings are basic: saut√©ed/raw onions, mustard, relish, cheese (extra)    Overall: For a late night burger, it does the trick.  No tables, just a counter and a bench. Many people eat in the parking lot or their car."}
{"text":"At 3.80 for a burger this place is great. Minus  one star for lack of toppings and no mayo but the essentials are there also for the price i understand. I recommend"}
{"text":"Nothing special by comparison to other gourmet style burgers, but definitely one of the best burgers ever.   +consistency (food tastes the same every time) +fast and occasionally entertaining service +onion rings (get the effing onion rings) +open late +very reasonably priced ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An institution (this place makes eating in a parking lot on the hood of your car fun)."}
{"text":"Wow  I live in scarbough and dislike coming here. But I had foodie friends from out of town read the glowing yelp reviews.    I should have gone to Harveys down the street for a frozen patty or upgraded to  swiss  chalet down the street.   if you like cheap frozen patties and frozen fries this is the place for you.  If you want cheap food go to Costco for a hot dog and pop for $2.   If you want a fresh made hamburger go to real mccoys at markham and Lawrence"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is always friendly, regardless of the time of day. I typically come in when it's 2 am - 3 am and even if there are a bunch of people waiting for their orders, the customer service is top notch; they're always willing to give you a nice smile or a quick greeting. They remember your face, which is extremely important. These days, corporate chains dominate the fast food market and customer service is never as personable compared to small businesses. People say they love the Starbucks experience, but Johnny's is beyond compare.   I will always be a lifelong customer because they treat me with respect and they are familiar with my order. They even have the courtesy of asking me how my night was, which is always great because I'm at this establishment!  The food is excellently priced. How could you go wrong with a burger that only costs $3.05? Mind you, you won't get a gourmet burger but you get a good meal at a great value. In addition, they have a grape drink that has absolutely ruined my love for Kool-aid grape drink and a delicious chocolate milkshake that you'll always be wanting more.  The decor is vintage, which is an interesting twist on a fast food joint. What's memorable is the adorable the orange and blue uniforms the employees have to wear; how adorable is that?  Quick Tips:  1. Know what you want before ordering because they strive for efficient service, otherwise you'll annoy the patrons in the line and the cashier.  2. There is no debit/credit machine so you'll have to use cash; there's a TD machine next to the plaza and a CIBC across from it.  3. They are open until 3 am on Fridays and Saturdays, which is great if you're hankering for greasy food after a night out drinking or dancing.  4. They are closed on Sundays  Conclusion: Show your support by going to this quaint and vintage-like burger joint! Maybe I'll see you there =)"}
{"text":"Another iconic Toronto burger dive. Back in the day there was a verbal war between the customers of Square BOYS and Johnny's, always arguing over who had the best burgers. This was before the internet folks. Although not as great as it once was, Johnny's offers up a decent burger experience for cheap. Burgers are frozen, same burgers as any other burger place. Fries and Onion rings are better than Harveys. It's basically one step above Harveys/Mcdonald's. Going there and expecting great service is absurb. Do you expect great service from Harvey's as well? Seriously,what do people expect from min wage employees these days? This is a basic burger dive that has better burgers than your average fast food restaurant. A great experience for those who weren't born twenty years ago and want to experience old school burgers and fries, which are much better than Mcdonald's and Harvey's crap from today."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I find this place to be a little overrated.  Nothing really stands out to me aside from the fact that the burgers taste different from your standard commercial burger joint.  The problem with this difference is that there are plenty of independently owned burger joints that meet the same criteria.  Not to say that it tastes bad, it does not, it just doesn't have that wow factor to warrant anything more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good food. Great value. Open till late. They have been there since 1967.!!!!! How can you not like johnny's burgers?!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Johnny's forever. Love their burgers! Usually, i get at least 2! The burgers are a great price, though condiments are just your standard, but the overall burger is great! Will be going back for a long time."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. From the outside looking in, the building seems run-down, disgusting and abandoned. From the inside looking out... Well, it's just about the same. Despite the dirty scenery and location, the delicious food they serve surely makes up for it! The famous Johnny hamburger is to die for. It has a smokey taste and it is HUGE! The toppings are simple which personally, I enjoy. Their fries and poutine are a must-try. Although, the workers are kind of, well, creepy. I went there to eat with my friend and a 40+ year old hit on her.... Uh..... Keep in mind we're 17 years old. Anyways, other than that overwhelming customer service, this is a simple and classic hamburger joint is must-see!"}
{"text":"A hamburger is just a hamburger. Not to say it isn't slightly better than others, just not as good as all the hype it has been given. I gave it 2 stars to bring down the average to where it is supposed to be 3/5 stars.  Portions are kind of small for the price. 1 combo won't fill me up and 2 combos is too much food.  Final comment, good food for if you are in the area, just not spectacular."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 18. I brought my girlfriend here who is now my wife and now, I come here with my kids who are now in university and high school. Johnny's has been a family staple my whole life I don't know how this place could get less than five stars, maybe a four for parking but that is the pharmacy not Johnny's. It is delicious, affordable, and in a good location. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I have read the reviews and figured I'd give the place a try. As I walked towards the place, the smell of grilled burgers fills the air. Ordered the Banquet Burger with the Sweet Onions and Tomatoes. I'd have to say it was an ok burger, I wasn't impressed by it. Granted the price was decent for the burger but, meh, you get what you pay for I guess. They opted to use the thin patties in their burgers. Which is ok if it tasted good, but it was bland and unseasoned (Unlike Holy Chuck's which tastes amazing, but not at this price). The toppings tasted good tho. The buns used was just regular white buns, again, nothing special.  Like I said earlier, its an OK burger with a good price that justifies it. But if you're willing to spend a dollar or two more for flavor, there is a Wendy's or Harvey's located a few blocks south of it. I will come back again to have another burger when I'm strapped for cash, or maybe try the fries and gravy.  FYI: This place does not have a dining area except for a bench for people waiting for their orders. And the parking lot can be tricky to navigate for some."}
{"text":"This place is over rated, it stays in business because it's been there so long and people stay loyal to it for some reason. Its like a high school cafeteria. Burgers are medium grade commercial patties at best and there is no where to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"Love this place, I have been going here since the early 2000s and hands down the best burger joint in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Flat out the best Burger I have ever had bar none. I love Burgers and I have searched for a better one out there somewhere and I can' t find it. I have eaten here all my life and I have nevear had a less then perfect burger. The steak and Slouvaki are also awesome.  The fries and Gravy are amazing best gravy you can find.  I just love this place, I would be heartbroken if it ever closed down."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was rather reluctant to enter the restaurant because it just looked so worn down and sketchy. Patties are also frozen, there is no lettuce for burgers, there are few parking spots in a tiny parking lot and no seats to eat at so you really have to take your food to go. On the plus side, the food here is cheap and it is a non franchise burger place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Can't say much that hasn't been said before. A Scarborough classic best bang for your buck when it comes to quick eats. Gives any burger a run for its money."}
{"text":"Cool place to stop in and get a quick burger but don't expect anything crazy. The quality is subpar and the the service has always been sketchy. My favorite thing from there is their sides like fries and gravy and onion rings. Prices are not bad but remember you pay for what you get. Basically the burgers are never cooked fully and the buns are so big compared to the size of the burger. The selection of toppings could be a little better to. Still considered to be a neighborhood staple but it used to be a lot better when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Sigh... After spending half my life in Scarborough, I finally got a Johnnyburger & I am not as impressed as I should be. My expectations were a bit high. I think most of their clientele being middle-aged makes Johnny's a nostalgic childhood craving since this joint has been around from the 1960s or approx. 20 years before I was born & those now 50-something-pluses used to go here as a hangover cure in their rowdy teenaged years.   I love how the 5 or so guys behind the counter are in their clean, charming uniforms & paper hats ready & willing to serve you. They have a whole system down to a science for serving people very quickly along with temperature retention of the food (in spite of their infamous & frequently hideous lineups that would make Timmies & McDonald's seethe with a morbid jealous hatred).   I also find it looks very good on their part for keeping some of the same employees for decades. You know a place is a reputable success when the turnover rate is a virtual nonentity. It's fantastic they grill the buns. However, it is far too substantial for the modestly-sized patty (even if I hate wimpy, doughy, over-processed Wonder Bread-type burger buns).   It annoys me to no end that there's no lettuce. I hate iceberg but adore leaf & Romaine so it would be hard for them to get that right anyhow. Had to add some leaf lettuce at home & zap the burger for 20 seconds. Very messy. A definite 2-hand burger. If you think you can drive or do something with one hand & feed yourself with the other, be prepared to have the beast unhinge itself & spill its delicious guts all over your lap-- which makes it a huge pity there's no indoor dining area.   Pardon my hangups but WHY OH WHY is the beef so over-ground rendering the patty flat and textureless? It was almost on par with the Harvey's burger I had the other day. I also got a tiny chunk of bone which I momentarily thought was a piece of my own molar. The bone discovery was very reassuring though-- because at least I know they use real meat. It's just that there seems to be a non-egg/gluten-based binder which is holding this patty together & giving the burger an unnatural chewiness akin to chemically-molested veggie or soy protein burgers (precisely why I don't dine at Harvey's anymore). The Lick's (vegetarian) Nature Burger tasted better than this.  The $9.03 cheeseburger at Five Guys & $7? Japaburger at Eki Bento are both worth it not to eat here (even for a measly $3.05?, which was impressively economical, BTW). Cannot wait to try Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck and other gourmet burgers that put McDonald's, Burger King, & other low burger achievers to shame.   P.S. The sauteed onions were too thick, greasy & insufficiently browned. I really didn't want to say anything bad about this place but I almost had no choice. I know they are Scarborough royalty and they put us on the map but I've had too many good burgers to give this beloved landmark a better rating.  P.P.S. They are a CASH ONLY business! The prices are decent but I did not like withdrawing money from an ATM & paying bank fees for the withdrawal."}
{"text":"Simple put Johnny's is the best non-franchise burger joint in T.O.  It is a cult favourite in Scarborough. I absolutely love this place for not changing who they are and that is a small burger joint that looks exactly the way it did forever! Classic Scarborough gem of a restaurant. I always have their Steak on a Kaiser with fries n gravy for around 10$ . Their portion size is very fair with a big sandwich n generous portion of fries. In summer we love coming here n eat outside near our cars because this is a mostly take out resto. I also like visiting in winter during my lunch. This is an old fashioned place which never gets old and a landmark in Scarborough. 5 stars  Fave combo: Steak on a Kaiser with fries and gravy."}
{"text":"Whats all the hype about here? These burgers are thin flat and terrible and the fries are soggy.  This place has been way over hyped for years.  you can taste the frozen'ness of the burgers, and the meat tastes stale.  Tried three times to like it, no thanks, never again."}
{"text":"Great value and huge hamburgers, love the grape drink, and steak burger. I usually stopped by on weekend in the middle of the night. When u bored of McDonalds then this might be a great choice."}
{"text":"Very well run and clean. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries. One onion rings LS a gravy.  Total was just over $13.  So very good value.   The patties are from Macgregor's (from the boxes) . Not sure if that means anything to you.   Cash only I think."}
{"text":"Love this place ! It is a Toronto institiution ! Makes the best burgers in the city hands down !  I have been going here since the 80's and havent stopped going.......... The burgers are the best and should be tried by everyone who live in the gta !"}
{"text":"Johnnys should have sold it's business when the area was bring done over. If you only have $3 left in your pocket and you are really that hungry, this is probably your best bet, besides that...horrible.."}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers in Toronto -- hands down.  Same staff working there for years, extremely competent and fast.  TAKE-OUT ONLY. CASH ONLY. These guys don't mess around.  Secret bonus: There's one picnic table at the back for the regulars."}
{"text":"I think I first went to Johnny's in 1984 or 1985 and I loved it from the first day. They have managed to keep the quality high and the prices low and if you don't mind lining up and eating in your car or, on a warm day/evening outside, do yourself a favour and head up there."}
{"text":"\"WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU MARIA?!\" - they call all the ladies that.  Love this place!   It's cheap, fast, fun and definitely a great way to end your night!   Always loved having a burger, fries and a milkshake there during the summer nights. Nothing beats having good laughs with friends on a park bench while chowing down on some awesome burgers at 2 am!    Just a friendly reminder...don't ask for lettuce. LOL"}
{"text":"The reason I went to Johnny's Hamburger is because it was one of the top food places, in Scaborough (based on urbanspoon's reviews) . I was surprised..but heck, i went to check it out. The environment was pretty much what it was described on urbanspoon. The service, was...decent. Not bad but not great. You basically just get your burger and get out. I went in there with high expectation because of the great reviews...I came out a bit disappointed. I mean sure it was a good hamburger, but it wasn't anything special. I don't think I will be going back there anytime soon...thats not because it was bad, it because theres nothing worth going back for. (at least for me) Its not one of those places where you have to go back for second."}
{"text":"It's not bad. I didn't grow up in this area so I don't have nostalgia like a few of the other reviews. Frozen burgers but they are charbroiled. The fries are frozen as well. All in all not bad if you are in the area, but nothing special. The prices are really good though."}
{"text":"I been going here since I was a kid!! Took the bus here with two tokens and $3 in my pocket to get a burger and a drink. Now prices are gone up of course but the food still same. Its old school and yuppies no LED screens here with artsy waitresses. The servers are to the point and will not hold back. So if you are love are and like to hold your pinky finger up when you sip your Starbucks is warned!! The burgers absolutely amazing!! I am bit biased here because I been going here for a long time. I think it's very nostalgic and good value for your money. AWSOME PLACE!!"}
{"text":"This place has an old school feel to it, awesome, right? Yeah! The food is cheap but just average in taste. There aren't many seats so you may have to settle for the curb in the parking lot but other than that, I'd definitely come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I don't understand what is the hype for this place? They serve an.okay burger. Maybe its good because it opens late."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a bang for you buck. The burgers are huge and the price is fairly cheap. Although these burgers are not my favourite, it ia one of those places that every Scarbarian should visit!"}
{"text":"Johnny's is a neighborhood favourite and very much a nostalgia thing with my friends and family. There are picnic tables outside in the summer so you can have a quick seat and scarf down the goods, but in the colder months people either take the food home or eat in their cars.   Not fancy, but a big juicy flame broiled burger. I could do without the fries. The souvlaki is pretty good as well, but I almost always save my appetite for the burger. 4 stars for being what they profess to be, and doing it well: a quick and delicious burger joint."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I have been going here since I was a kid. This place is an institution I have many fond memories of eating here.   So when I happened to find myself in Scarborough  and craving a burger this was my first stop. And well let's just say my tastes has changed a lot since my younger days.   Don't get me wrong this place meets many burger joint must haves; namely great milkshakes, yummy onion rings and of course greasy burgers. But the quality of the burger was the problem. They where frozen burgers not fresh from ground beef. I guess I shouldn't have expected real beef but the place is called Johnny's hamburgers!! As soon as you walk in there are open boxes of burgers everywhere announcing that you will not be getting anything fresh. Fries where also a disappointment. They were similar to the fries I remember from my high school cafeteria. If you must order them get then covered in gravy or make sure you smother them in ketchup.   The sum up... - great milkshakes, onion rings, and old school retro ambiance, tasty burgers considering they aren't real beef, oh and it's super cheap! We ordered 2 bacon cheese burgers, fries, onion rings, and a milkshake gave the guy $20 and got back change  - the negatives poor quality burgers, fries tasteless   If you are in the area need a burger, don't have a lot of money, pass by this place. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"EVERYONE has that craving once in a while for a FAT juicy burger. Don't deny it! The only place that can fully satisfy your craving is JOHNNY'S.  Similar to Golden Star (in Thornhill), it hasn't been renovated for AGES. The place is really small. They do not accept any methods of payment other than cash, and they have very few parking spots.  THE BURGERS.... YOU MUST..YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST have Johnny's Hamburgers before you get too old and get dentures."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent, simple, inexpensive meal, this is definitely the joint for you ! Johnny's Hamburger's has been an institution since it started. (Back in 1967?) and Johnny's seems like it's been around forever. Since at least since the early 1970's anyway. Really, not much has changed in all that time. The menu is pretty much the same as it's always been. The burger's are charcoal broiled, and they're delicious. Their condiments are fresh, and the pickles taste really sour and good, which is nice, if you're a big fan of pickles, like me. Everyone comments that there's no lettuce, but who really needs lettuce on a burger anyway?  Especially when the burger tastes this good? The prices are low, but it's important to remember it's cash only! The service is fast, but there's no seating inside. I'd like to tell you about the Steak on a Kaiser. It's what I usually get now. Personally, I think it's a good deal for the money too. The only big knock against Johnny's is that the staff are borderline rude at times !  One time, many years ago, I overheard one of the staff call another customer a derogatory name in the Greek language!  I guess he thought that we were just a bunch of Munchy-Cake Canadian's, who wouldn't understand his words, but I did know and understand the nasty name he called this person. it wasn't a good word. For some people, name-calling in another language is a deal breaker, Right? ... Right!"}
{"text":"better than Burger King and tastes fresher... if you are running on a budget I recommend this place used to go there every night about 5 years ago when I didn't have much money in my pocket... get a burger for $3.50 and a milkshake around $2"}
{"text":"Reminds me so much of Harvey's down to the onion rings, the orange colour and the grilled burgers, I guess that's what burger joints were like in the 50s/60s. You order, you are given a number and you wait for them to call you. No place to sit other than a bench for waiting. Does quite a brisk business, though. I disliked that they stapled the bag as the staple didn't close properly and I got stabbed. The prices were quite inexpensive, though."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once a month for the last eight years. If you eat at a place that often, you expect them to screw up every now and again; it happens. But Johnny's doesn't screw up; every burger is consistent and filling. These guys really do take pride in their work, and it's $3 for the best burger I've ever had. I'd recommend Johnny's to anybody."}
{"text":"Been coming here from 08' till now. Occasionally, though. Friendly staff, price didn't seem to change all that much. Great place to grub on if you want something fast and reasonable."}
{"text":"Why are there good reviews? This place never has any toppings for its burgers (there's no lettuce...what kind of burger is that). How is it even considered a good place to eat? You guys have never been anywhere better?"}
{"text":"Johnny's is best eaten super late on a weekend night, when essentially everything else is closed but you need something greasy to sop up all the liquor you've just downed from mugs, all classy-like, as some of my friends sometimes like to do.  It reminds me of the diner from Two Broke Girls, except minus any tables and no Kat Dennings.  The cooks are always the same small team of men, who work quickly, efficiently, and without much chatter.  Most people take their food to go or just eat in their cars. Which reminds me: If you're actually here post-drinking, you should come here with a DD/designated driver.  Aside from the fact that you should never drink and drive, it's also a popular hiding spot for cops in the dark back parking lot.  Not a reason to go or not to go here, but just giving an FYI.   The patties are about 3mm thick each, so if you're super hungry, consider doubling up on the patties for an additional $1.25 or so.  For prices not far from McD's, you'll get a fresh-to-order burger with toppings of your choice.  With the original cardboard cartons that delivered their produce sometimes still in sight, at least you can be assured that the fresh ingredients had to be prepped on-site rather than coming from pre-made bags.   There's nothing mind-blowing about the fare, but at under $4 for burgers and roughly $2 for sides like milkshakes, fries, poutine, or onion rings, this place has the feel and prices of being frozen in time in the early '90s and gives a certain nostalgic feel."}
{"text":"Seeing all the great reviews about johnny's burger made me give it a try, unfortunately the rest of the night I was vomiting in my bathroom. I somehow got food poisoning from Johnny after eating just a hamburger and onion rings."}
{"text":"They've changed their milkshakes, they only do chocolate now, comes out of a machine, and taste like soft serve that they make you suck out of a straw. Those old Johnny's milkshakes were handmade and the best in the city."}
{"text":"You really can't hate a burger joint that's been serving the community for as long as I remember for under $4 a burger AND that's opened late. Like legit.  All the staff is ALWAYS smiling even when I take forever to decide what I'm \"feeling\" for, then change my mind three times and then ask for more hot pepper. This spot always hits the spot whether it be 3pm or 3am. Just don't stand outside by yourself at 3am because some random will try and offer you and ride home. And no, you should not accept their offer.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger place, the food is not pretentious and taste really good, love their cheeseburger and poutine (of course, i always get extra gravy with it) for the price, you will be filled with just 10 bucks and still would get change, i always come here during afternoons to chill down the rush hour."}
{"text":"Johnny Hamburger has been around for years... pricing is very reasonable (cheeseburger $4.50 taxes in) lunch special  add a fries pop $6.00 and service is quick.... gentleman expediting the burgers I think is employee number 1 when they opened. He reminds me of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld episodes.   Let's decipher this burger... the burger bun is excellent. Tastes like it was just baked. The McGregor Meat frozen patty is tasty for what it is. Almost like a Harvey's patty. The grilled onions and pickle are kick ass and a must. Great burger joint that hasn't sold out in 50 years. Well done."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't found this place until this year! Obviously everyone else refers to this place as a classic, but I just recently visited a couple times. Johnny's Hamburgers is cheap, good food. It's very filling. I ordered the cheeseburger and onion rings, which totalled around 5-6 dollars. The onion rings here are amazing. I've also had their milkshake and it's great. Very thick and flavourful.   I also love how convenient this place is. It's open until 3AM Monday to Saturday. It even has its own wikipedia page! The one downside is that there isn't really a place to eat. It's much like a drive through except you just park your car in the back and order. I usually eat in the car or while I'm walking.   Everyone needs to give Johnny's Burgers a try at least. It's a classic burger joint that I crave pretty often."}
{"text":"Boy this shit be fire   The gravy is bigger than my fist, it's like the size of a triple shot of espresso, burger bigger than my damn self. I'd recommend to go there"}
{"text":"Location/Service It's along Victoria Park, in-between a Shoppers Drug Mart and TD Bank plaza. You can only turn when you're heading north of Victoria Park due do a very high traffic zone. But plenty of parking you can use in either plaza (and limited parking right in front of the restaurant).   There's no seating inside, only a small bench outside. Everyone pretty much buys it to go as a quick stop. Service was okay - there were a lot of staff equipped during lunch time, but I felt a little intimidated and rushed by the person making my burger.  Food Ordered a lunch combo (available from 11am-2pm). For $6.00, you get a burger, fries and a soft drink - can't really complain about the price (which also explains the service). The lunch combo is their regular hamburger. You get to choose additional topics - which includes your typical lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup/mustard. The patty itself was okay - it was done to the right level, but I felt it's a little dry despite having ketchup and mustard in there. Fries were okay too, not too oily.  If you really want cheap, fast food - this is the place. I didn't have great expectations and I got what I expected it to be. I'll be interested to their other burgers to spot any difference. And right between Victoria Park/Sheppard (Highway 401) intersection, it's a great spot for office workers. Remember to bring cash (no credits)"}
{"text":"I had first been to this place in 1994. I had revisited it around early 2000 when there was still a small parking lot surrounded by grass and recently revisited it again about a Summer or two ago with the area around it now developed. The prices have gone up over the years but not too bad for what you get. This place has it's own character with the orange color and the employees, along with what reminds me of a greasy diner/ truck stop feel stuck in a time warp. I'm a burger fanatic and I'd rate them as average. The burgers are quite descent, but nothing fancy or over the top for me to go out of my way for. I would still pick it over McDonalds. There are a mix of very different people who come here which added to the line up and long wait times. And from what I understand they have no lettuce and you have to pay in cash only. After seeing this place exist for 20+ years, they could have at least invested in some tables and chairs or expansion because you may still end up eating in the parking lot before the food gets cold."}
{"text":"Cheap, easy, fast, classic late night cult favourite. You want lettuce on your cheeseburger? \"NO LETTUCE!\" Haha. Not the best burger joint in the city, but if you're hungry at 1:00 in the morning on a Wednesday night there's not much more satisfying. That being said: know what you're getting into... -They ARE just frozen patties--nice large patties, but frozen nonetheless.  -It's take-out only other than a couple of park benches in the summer.  -The food comes out fast and hot...be ready when they call your number!  -No Lettuce. Just get over it. Haha, you're having a burger not a salad. Put some nice healthy fried onions on there instead. The souvlaki and steak on a Kaiser are also both good, but a straight up cheeseburger is the way to go. Fries and Onion rings are both great side options.  Johnny Burgers in a cardboard box sitting in the car in the middle of the summer with the windows down is hard to beat. I'd be kind of crushed if this place ever closed. They've rebuilt a lot of the area around this building since I've been going for the last 20 years, but this little orange box survives."}
{"text":"There is limited parking... we had to park at the parking lot next door.  The employees get upset when people take too long to order and I've witnessed a couple of the employees making fun of a customer... jerks!  That is what you get when you hire teenagers.  Food was oily.  I am never going to go there again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and it was pretty busy around lunch.   Pros: - Well priced  - Clean - Good tasting food  Cons: - No seating area"}
{"text":"Johnny's truly needs no introduction. They are very well known in and around the GTA for producing highly satisfying burgers time and time again, in fact many will argue that they produce THE most satisfying burgers around. The establishment has been around for as long as I can remember and with good reason.  Religiously I'll order the banquet burger which is your classic burger topped with bacon and cheese. One can have it topped with any of the standard condiments except for lettuce (don't ask why), with the addition of caramelized onions. IMO the bun is so vital in the success of a burger, at Johnny's the ones they use are well soft, fresh and massive.   DO NOT be bent out of shape if you visit the restaurant and can't find parking, or the employees get mad because you take too long to order, or become mad because you take too long to dress your burger, you don't have cash, or you simply cant find a spare picnic table to eat at. Bottom line is that its damn worth it, so suck it up, learn the rules, and indulge on the mouthgasm.    Fries and onion rings are a solid accompaniment to the burger. If ever I feel like the gi-normous burger won't completely fill me up, I'll usually cop a side of onion rings. They are perfectly fried petite onion rings which often find their way directly into my burger.   If you heart burgers then you've probably already been too, or heard of the infamous Johnny's. Otherwise get over their and get your eat on, see why this spot is one of Mike Myer's go to eateries in the GTA"}
{"text":"The service was really great but the burger itself wasn't very good. The outside of the burger patty  was cooked but the inside was raw and mushy with no flavour."}
{"text":"I remember going to Johnny's with my dad as a kid. For the price you pay the food is still a great value. I always stop by when I am in the Area."}
{"text":"Fast food, low quality, minimal taste. There are better burgers in the area...... Like Harvey's or Wendy's"}
{"text":"What happened to the Johnny's I grew up with in the 90's?! I remember back in the day when I used to get excited whenever my dad brought back Johnny's, but sadly I'd just drive right past this place without even looking anymore.  If I'm not mistaken, the hamburger patties have drastically changed and now taste like your below average frozen grocery store varieties.  Please bring back the original recipes!!  I honestly don't think keeping your prices historic while sacrificing the quality of your meat is a good idea.  The average person would gladly pay that extra $2 for quality!  If Johnny's won't change, well atleast I'll  always have those memories."}
{"text":"This place never let's you down! Been coming here  for over 10 years and still tastes the same! One of the best burger joints in the GTA!"}
{"text":"The most overrated burger of all time. If you are hammered at 2am and want a frozen burger that tastes like tofu than this is your place.  PS. Don't ask for lettuce, they haven't had it in over 150 years.  I've had better customer service at the US border."}
{"text":"Really good hamburgers and fries with gravy and good price point. The fries are good on their own but they have a really nice gravy so it's definitely worth it.   Patty is thin and you get your choice of toppings. No seating so you can sit outside if it's a nice day or enjoy the burger in your car. They've been here for a while but I've only been here since this year and it's become one of my favourite burger places."}
{"text":"Yup, I fell for it again! It was super-late, and not willing to brave McDoofus' drive through, I gave Johnny's another shot. ERROR!  I SO should have driven to Real McCoy or Burger Shack, even Wendy's.  Frozen Scheiders-style ultra-thin cereal-laden patty, cheap frozen McCain fries, grumpy staff, zero parking, it's just awful!  HOW do people love this place?? really??  OK, so a closer reading of the other reviews and I've figured it out!    First let me say that I DO indeed love the premium burgers at places like Burger's Priest and Sinner's Burgers, but I am not a snob, I also love Real McCoy in Scarberia, Golden Star North York, and Burger Shack down near Eglinton, west of Yonge. But NOT Johnny's!  Read each review, and the problem becomes clear - EVERY 4 and 5 star review mentions either price, or nostalgia. \"I used to come here when I was a drunk student\" or \"This is a great burger for $3\". There's the trouble. I want a great burger, not \"the most meat flavoured cereal filler $3 can buy\" nor \"The burger I used to love, after I'd vomit Bacardi Breezers in a parking lot.\"  Save your money, go to Real McCoy, Golden Star, Burger Shack, Harvey's, Wendy's, ANYWHERE, just don't fall for the nostalgia-tainted opinions listed below ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great, i've been coming here since the 70's as a wee lad, very consistent, fast service. In a time of gourmet burgers Joohnny's has still stuck with their standard frozen burger which is charbroiled over and open flame to perfection. Very similar to Harvey's but better,  Considering also that a cheeseburger and fries cost less than $8 is also ridiculous, super cheap eats here folks. If you are looking for simple burgers and fries, shakes and hot dogs, this place is it. they've been around for 50 years for a reason."}
{"text":"A Toronto landmark. I actually worked one summer here as a kid. Many of the originals that ran the place are no longer with us, but one thing that remains is they make a really solid burger.  What sets it apart? It's not an over engineered burger designed is some lab(burger king, Wendy's, McDonald's etc) and they don't pass off these home style phone book thick burgers devoid of any juice and flavor. What you get is a thick, juicy, satisfying burger that isn't drowned in special sauces or other unnecessary toppings (btw in burgers lettuce is unecessary). Give them a try. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for almost 10 years. I used to eat here every other day during my 5 high school years. I got the Johnny's taste of a over loaded dirty burger imprinted in my brain. However, after my visit today, I am very disappointed. The burger is not as charcoal burn as its used to be,the texture of the meat is totally different and there isn't any juicy oily beef taste which you get from a burger. I know they have keep the cost down, but I rather have an amazing burger which cost me more."}
{"text":"The burger is always good here. Only come here late at night and super hungry, maybe that's why it's so good? The patty to bun ratio is perfect and the toppings are not soggy so it's not messy. They have a good system and the burgers are priced pretty reasonable at $3.20 each.  Food 4.5/5 Service 4/5 Ambiance 2/5 Value 4/5  ========= Overall 4.2"}
{"text":"I go to Johnny's about once every couple months. The Banquet Burget is my choice. If you want a reasonably price burger and fries for $6-$7, then this is the place.  For people who like the expensive and well overpriced Burgers Like Hero, 5 Guys, Priest ...etc. this is not for you."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place! It sucks so bad! Burger was burnt the buns overlap the meat the fries were bad. I can't believe this place has customers. Frozen Patties it's straight up crap."}
{"text":"The burger is nothing to write home about. I agree with another reviewer who said it was thin and somewhat artifical in texture and taste. Not what you would expect from a mom and pop shop. It was a lot like a frozen burger. The onion rings were phenomenal, though! So crispy and fried to perfection. They were legit.  I saw about 80% of the orders were for \"Steak and Fries.\" I'll try that next time as it seems to be their specialty and better than their burgers."}
{"text":"A nice break from the fast food norm in the area...don't get me wrong I can eat Big Macs all day long but sometimes ya want different kind've McJunkfood. Onion Rings here are top shelf and never enough. Cheeseburgers better than 'meh'."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it's usually pretty good.  Great value, great taste and texture, so-so never really smiling service.  This is a no frills burger joint that often gets it right.    Today's burgers were a bit disappointing and I remember it being usually better.  For under $10 including tax, we got a cheese burger, hamburger and a chocolate milkshake.  The burgers are hefty and feel like a quarter pounder.  We took the burgers home before eating them and by then, everything felt a bit mushy and really not so fresh.  The chocolate shake was great though!  Aside from the thick, yummy milkshakes (there's strawberry and vanilla too), try the onion rings!  Not sure what the future of Johnny's is as according to the local MPs letter, they're trying to move the place as it's the middle lot of two other lots on either side that have been purchased by a developer.  They've offered him a new location with a drive-thru, but Johnny isn't budging.    By the way, parking is limited up front and you can only get to it going northbound on Victoria Park - you'll have to do a U-turn if you're approaching on the southbound lanes."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest I have no idea what the hype has been around Johnny's for the past ten years before ten years this place was soooo bomb, now you get a Costco made patty, and my main main issue with Johnny's is how can have a burger joint and not have lettuce for toppings! That is completely beyond me, giving two stars because honestly the burgers are no good anymore, and by not providing lettuce let's be real here... your making unfinished burgers! Honestly that has had me question this place for years!"}
{"text":"Great place, great price I enjoy coming here whenever i am nearby, but i have a few issues with this location: 1.The quality is going down yearly 2.The location is not very easy to drive in and out of 3.The lines can get long at times 4.It is take out, so there is no place to eat.  Dont get me wrong, this place is great, and the price is still like always, but i cant taste the difference in the burgers they sell today."}
{"text":"This place baffles me.  The burgers here are the cheap, frozen, right out of the box type you'd find at any neighbours backyard bbq.  The quality is lower than Harvey's.  The service is terrible and toppings are pathetic(They don't even have lettuce).  The only reason I can see people liking this place is because of the nostalgia of it.  Most people in scarborough grew up on this place as one of its few late night burger joints.  If  you want a good burger in that area late at night go to Esquires atleast they have homemade burgers."}
{"text":"This has been a staple ever since I was a kid. The burgers are great, but like other reviewers, the quality has gone down a little bit over the years. This is an in and out type joint. Get a number, wait for it (sometimes quite a while since some lineups get quite long,) and then pick your condiments (onion, pickles, tomatoes, bbq onions, mayo, ketchup, mustard, bbq, and hot sauce,), pack it up and get out! This is a purely take out joint. There are some benches on the side of the building, which is kind of neat on a summer day, but during the winter you'll see everyone eating in their cars or leaving. The fries and gravy are really good. The burgers are large and tasty, but don't expect the amount of topping other burger joints have. Keep your expectations realistic, but for the price you cannot beat this place. At 3am on a Friday or Saturday expect to wait forever to receive your order."}
{"text":"3 for the burgers and 1 for the memories.  My first Johnny's burger was in highschool. Back in the days where the Shoppers building next door didn't exist and the Johnny's sign upfront didn't light up. The food here was definitely affordable even for on a highschool kid's allowance.  The staff here are definitely more friendly than they look. I used to be able to walk in and the burger-chef would remember my order and what toppings I'd like on my burgers.  After almost 10 years, I still come back here from time to time. I don't care if people think the burgers are not as good as some \"gourmet\" burger joints or think not having lettuce is a crime against humanity. Johnny's hamburger would still be my #1 choice if I want a nice and satisfying burger....even at 1am."}
{"text":"Came back after many years. Loved Johnny's back in the day. While the charm, low prices and nostalgia remain, the taste doesn't. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the higher quality, and higher price tag, of all the new hipster burger joints, but this visit had me wondering about the ingredients in Johnny's burger patties. Methinks I'm better off not knowing! Either way, I'm sure I'll make my way back someday, just not right away."}
{"text":"Their burgers are big and they taste fresh. It's hard to find a place where the patties don't taste stale. You can choose large amounts of toppings and condiments. The fries are definitely worth a try. No wonder they are open for this long!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the city! The establishment kinda feels like you're in the 50's minus servers on roller-skates attending the parking lot drive-in, lol"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood & needed to grab a quick lunch. I decided with Johnny's because I'd heard a lot about this place. The place was clean & there were a few other customers besides me. The place has an old school feel to it. There are no tables & chairs for dine in customers. The prices are very decent & the service was fast, which was great since I was on a time crunch. I got the special combo, burger, small fries, & small drink which came to around $6 & something. I was initially very happy with the size of the burger, it was huge. However, in the first few bites, even with the few toppings I put, I found the burger beef patty itself to be bland. The fries were thick cut & okay. If you need a quick bite & need it at a decent price, maybe give the place a try. I don't think I'll be visiting this again considering I found the burger itself bland."}
{"text":"What is it about this place, it is the fact that you know what to expect that makes it amazing? The burgers are great, my companion swears by the steak on a roll. The fries are OK, I would definitely recommend the onion rings instead, which have whole rings of onions. Oh, and why not go for it, and get a shake as well? Your diet can begin again tomorrow."}
{"text":"VERY VERY over-rated place to get burgers.  They offer the cheapest burger available from suppliers, no seating, the staff are very rude & couldn't care less if you there or not."}
{"text":"Landmark of toronto....cheap burgers....so cheap....that I have to double up!!! The wait is long...but by the time you get to the car and start chomping on the juicy burger in your car....cant help but feel like you went back a few decade's...like drive in diner's that you hear about in the movies...ONION RINGS PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was a kid! This is the best place for a quick bite. Don't expect gourmet anything, just a greasy burger, basic toppings and fries.   Don't ask for lettuce, ask for hot peppers and cooked onions instead.   There are no tables, just a bench to wait for your order. Expect to take the good home or eat in your car (they will supply the make shift tray for the car). In the summer there are some park benches hidden behind the building."}
{"text":"Not much to add that other reviewers haven't said. If you want burgers and don't care for fancy buns or any other trendy marketing things, this is the place to go. Their no-frills approach keeps their prices low. It's not going to be the best burger you've ever had. But the prices will keep you coming back if you just want a good old fashioned burger to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"Busy fast good. Prices are amazing also. Burgers are 4 oz no big ones.:)will be back like supporting family businesses"}
{"text":"Its safe to say i remember why I stop going to Johnny's. Especially since i dont remember the last time.... the menu has gone through atleast two changes maybe more since i last went.   To put it simple. Its not good, its frozen patties so no fresh ground meat which i think people know. I cant see why Johnny is still busy as it is. Cheese burger is almost 4 buck but given it started at 3.50 back in the day so it not terrible on price.  There is no favour there the fried onion might help but still. Not a fan of orangish brown patty. Fresh burger or real mccoy will be better place to go.for classic burger  So long Johnny's"}
{"text":"Ever since I was in high school, this was the place I came for to satisfy my cravings for a nice juicy burger.   Unlike other burger places, Johnny's doesn't offer lettuce. Instead, you get a choice of tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish, and caramelized onions.  If you like something on the side with the burger, I recommend onion rings or poutine.   Had their steak on kaiser today, it was not as good as the hamburger.   4 stars because they don't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Being going there for over 40 years  What can I say Burgers souvlaki onion rings fries gravy Steak on a kaiser great Just something about the place hasn't really changed still see Johnny every now and then Live in the west end now but still go back Not fresh made burgers but something about them. Never duplicated anywhere Only problem progress parking smaller only one way out So what park in the plaza An institution"}
{"text":"We liked it!! Just went here tonight for the first time. Extra patty $1.65. We got double burgers, fries & onion rings $17. It's a little confusing when you walk in. We weren't sure where to go. I did miss having lettuce on my burger, but the staff were so nice I can do without. Everyone working there thanked us before we left. Really nice! Where do you get service like that anymore? We will return."}
{"text":"I think their regular single patty burger is a great value for the price.  - It's huge and comes with a nice soft Kaiser bun.  - They have your standard condiments, but also sauteed onions at no extra cost!   The prices are very affordable, and they open late."}
{"text":"This place has beene here for a while and is an old school burger joint that focus on two things. the value and bang for your buck. for the price you pay the quality and quantity is hard to beat from any burger joint. this placr has a lunch special for 6 dollars on weekdays that givrs you. big burger a soda and a good sized fries. hard to argue with value considering all their burgers and fries are fresh hot to order. the one thing this place loses out on is the amount of toppings they offer. they dont offer many toppings or sauce. just pickel tomatoes and onions. i really wish they would offer more variety of toppings. but overall they havr pretty good food. and the gravy for the poutin is a classic variety. in this area hard to find a better value for lunch"}
{"text":"Johnny's is so great!  They have a lunch combo that is only $6 and includes a hamburger & fries.  You sure get your money's worth as their portions are huge!  Such a great value.  The staff is also super friendly, and the service is very quick.  I will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing on my last visit. This use to be a go to as a youngster and then a teenager and young adult. Brought my own son last summer and told him so many stories. He ordered the hotdog and I the hamburger. Honestly I thought the burger from down the street at Harvey's was better.   Very disappointing and over rated now. So many other places to go to now for a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"I have been going to Johnny's Hamburgers since my husband introduced it to me one late night and I have been hooked ever since. I love that their menu is not big, its basic dive in food and its the best. They haven't changed anything on they menu from way back and the taste of everything is so good. Johnny's specals are Hot Dog, Cheese Dog, Steak on a Kaiser, Veal on a Kaiser, Fish on a Kaiser, Souvlaki on a Bun and Fish and Chips. Everything is so good and you cant go wrong with anything that you choose.  Toppings you can choose are Relish, Fried Onions, Fresh Onions, Tomatoes and Pickles. You can also ask for Tartar Sauce for the fish, secrets in their fridge.  Their milkshakes bring back memories of my childhood. Overall great simple food, great atmosphere, quick service and that's we we keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Not bad  Worth a try for variety.   I ordered a double and maybe I missed out on the true Johnny's experience.   Will try again and get the single next time in the area and let them suggest toppings."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I've been to Johnny hamburgers since I was a kid, and the amazing thing is not much has changed within the years.  The toppings are the same, pickles, tomatoes, onions, fried onions, relish.    The menu has just changed recently, before it used to be those old school style menus, like McDonald's before they came out with lcd tvs, if anybody could remember from that far back lol.   The burgers used to be $2.00, today it's up to $3.30. Which isn't bad considering its probably been 20 years.   Went there during lunch and they have a lot of people working.  There were probably like 6 workers, one person taking orders, 2 people dressing burgers and others cooking.   As usual, there were a lot of people, but they are very organized with calling out numbers, and by keeping their menu simple, they are able to get people out the door as quick as possible.   They have a lunch combo from 12-3pm for hamburger, fries and a drink for $5.75.  There are no substitution as I asked for onion rings instead and he said that would be full price.   The downfall is that there isn't any seating, we had to sit in our car to eat, and it's hard with a big burger and fries.  During the summer, they have 2 picnic tables in the back and lots of seagulls begging for food.    The burgers are pretty big, they had to give me 4 tomatoes in order to fill the bun!! Super yummy and I commend them on sticking with a simple menu and same toppings.  That's what makes them unique."}
{"text":"Wow this place is always busy! And I get why, because they have delicious burgers.  Burgers here are the cheapest I have ever seen, and I am impressed by the taste! I got a cheeseburger for $3.80 and it was soo juicy and cheesy!  Remember to grab a peach drink with your burger, it tastes amazing!  They have customers coming in and out, and they keep making burgers, service is very fast.  Review 57 of 100"}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in the community  Still there after all these years  This place is the perfect pit stop after a night of clubbing or drinking  The burger special hits the spot  They still don't offer lettuce but really it's not needed  The same guys are still there doing the orders  Will still be a place for that post party food craving!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made my way here. As a Pround Scarborough native it is a must to try these burgers. Let me say, I was NOT disappointed. There was definitely an old school vibe to these burgers right to the bun. Enough toppings to make anyone happy thou there is no lettuce. Fries were tasty and the gravy,  reminded me of being a kid with that dark,rich brown colour and thickness.  Be prepared for a line-up, thou it moves fast. They only deal with cash but there is an atm machine inside if your cash fund is lacking. I grabbed 3 banquet burgers, 2 fries, and gravy on the side and was surprised it only cost me $23 bucks.  I can not wait to go again, I would go today but they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"The burgers are huge for just $3, you can't beat that type of deal unless you go to McDonald's for their valu menu. These burgers are charbroiled and you get a choice of fried onions as your toppings. They just recently revamped their interior and completely updated their menu and added more items it seems. We frequent this joint weekly and are never disappointed. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"This is THE spot in the area and it's been that way forever.  I don't go here often but my friends that live closeby swear by it. It's cheap, tastes good, and leaves you satisfied.  Their burgers are pretty good.  They're not amazing, but for what you pay for, it's great.  Forget the Burger King, McDs, or A&W, this is where you want to be for a cheap and quick burger meal.  Their onion rings are friggin great and you can get a combo for around the same price as said fast food joints.    One problem is the lack of seating.  It's a small place and it's not very convenient to eat on the bench inside.  Make sure it's nice outside or drive here and eat in your car.    Other than that, it's perfect. If you live in the area, you already know this is the spot.  4/5."}
{"text":"I guess they used to be great. Money wise, this burger beats a lot of them out there. If you are really hungry and want something to eat for cheap you will be satisfied. But people who would like to have a juicy tasty burger will be dissappointed. Tastewise I was not impressed at all. A&W, Harvey's they make better burger than here. This place is much over rated.  The meat has charcoal flavour and the caramelized onions are tasty and that is where the good stuff ends. The meat is not that juicy, lacks flavour and the bun is also not tasty. I am not sure what they mix with the meat, as a beef patty should not at all taste like that. A great burger needs a great tasting bread and off course the meat.  I have given them three chances and not anymore...."}
{"text":"Had to line up which would be indicative of a good restaurant and when I finally went thru the line and ate my burger it was not unlike a  McDonald's $1.39 cheesburger.  Very greasy and nowhere possible to eat it in peace. The fries were also horribly greasy. Final nail in the coffin was the fact the staff did not even care if I was there or not.  No thank-you's etc....simply treated you like you were  a disturbacnce of sorts.  Will never go again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has taken me so long to write a review about Johnny's. Probably because it has been a long time since I went there. Well...that changed just last week because i was craving it big time! Everyone is always looking for the perfect burger, but what exactly IS the perfect burger?? Does it even exist? I've had $2 burgers and i've had $20 burgers. Price really makes NO difference to me. How it's seasoned, how it's cooked & how it's served and the type of bun it's on are what i look for. The first time i tried Johnny's i was 7 or 8 years old, now i'm taking my kids there for lunch or dinner. The burgers are some of the best tasting i've had, served on a great bun. Simple toppings offered, nothing to fancy that will take away from the delicious taste of their patties that are charcoal grilled to perfection. Another must for me - fries with ketchup & gravy and a large grape drink! Open late and ALWAYS busy (for a reason!). Know what you want & order fast because the line is always moving. Parking is a bit of a pain, but we always manage. Outdoor seating with picnic tables - perfect in the Summer!"}
{"text":"I grew up at VP and Sheppard so i am an honorary cousin...when I go in..they already know my order, when i lived in the states I have had people ask me if I ever been to johnnys, Mike Myers always bigs up Johnnys.  When u leave a club early just to make sure u get to johnnys before it closes you know that ur talking about a proper burger...yes I know its not a homeburger and its patties...dont matter cant beat johnnys just dont ask for lettuce, the green on the burger on the marquee is relish LOL"}
{"text":"Anyone giving this place more than two stars does not know a good burger.      The cheapest burger with the most filling available is what they are buying.  It is barely meat.  The charbroil is what gives it any taste."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to review this place because it has such nostalgic history in my heart, but it isn't, objectively, that spectacular. Johnny Burgers is a Toronto rite of passage. You can't be from Toronto and not 'love' Johnny Burgers. It's where you stop in after a late night. You can suggest it to your friends at 2am and they'll immediately respond with \"OOOOOO! Yes bro!\" The truth is that there's nothing fancy here. It's a straight burger. It's not the best and it's not the worst. The service is rough, but relatively fast. There aren't a ton of options and no one at this restaurant is going out of their way to accommodate you. Everything is a touch overpriced.   It is what it is. Eat it. Shut up. Don't over think it."}
{"text":"This place is where all the night owls would come to satisfy their hunger in the middle of the night.  Came here at around 1230am on a weekend and this place was packed!  Lineup to order was fast and I like their number system, the cashier gave us a number, told us it will be a 10 minutes wait, so my friend and I went back to the car to wait.  10 minutes later, walked back in and burgers were ready!  Added whatever topics I liked and dived right into it.  The burger was big!  Beef patty was juicy and the cheese melted perfectly on the beef patty.  Really loved my burgers on a late night and love how affordable the food are here!  Definitely a go to stop for late night meals for me now."}
{"text":"I was in an in-service in this area today. When lunch time rolled around my colleagues all started exclaiming about Johnny's. I had never been and they were anxious for me to try it out.  When we drove up to it I recognized it from driving by, but had never been in. The lineup encouraged me that I was at a good place.  Service was fast and friendly. I got a cheeseburger and onion rings. They gave me a number and when I was called up, I chose what to put on my burger.   Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty.  First of all, the toppings are VERY limited. Onions or saut√©ed onions, pickles, tomato, ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish...I didn't even see lettuce, unless it was hiding in the back.   The burger was large, but nothing special. It wasn't like some fantastic, juicy, seasoned meat or anything. Just a basic burger.   The bun was too soft and got soggy really fast. I mean SOGGY! It had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. The onion rings were your basic frozen onion rings...same with the fries. They weren't hand-battered, or homemade...just standard fare.   Honestly, NOTHING about this place warranted the rave reviews from my colleagues and the only thing I could glean from hearing them talk, was that this place has been around Scarborough forever and it's just a staple. You go here based on tradition.   Well, sadly that's not enough of a reason for me to give this a good review. It's also not enough of a reason for me to bother recommending this place. Unless this place has some near and dear meaning in your heart, Hero Burger makes a WAY better burger. I guess if you want your burger made with \"love and memories\" come to this place. I want my burger made with juicy meat, lots of veggies and some sort of mayo-based sauce! If you cannot deliver, I am not interested. Johnny's did not deliver for me on this one!  (PS- If you are the type of person who reads reviews, you'll see one of two camps here...people who love this place based on landmark status and people who haven't been coming here since they were young and therefore are not big fans. Basically THIS \"PS\" could be the review!)"}
{"text":"I ended up going to Johnny's Hamburgers with two friends of mine who are familiar with Scarborough. Apparently Johnny's is a landmark. I had never heard of it before! We went at night and the place was full (it is very small) so we had to wait a long time for our food. The food was relatively cheap and very good. I enjoyed reading all the newspaper articles on the wall and talking to one of the staff members about the history of Johnny's. If it wasn't so far I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We usually stop in at Johnny's about once a month. Maybe it was a bad night but for the 1st time ever we had the worst burger ever. The patty was overcooked and the server was grumpy. Things have changed but we are hoping it will be better the next time we stop in."}
{"text":"Oh, they make huge size burgers for really  cheap price. Have to try their onion ring."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????logo.???????????????????????????order?????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago, but it is really a great place if you want to have a good burger. The staff here are really kind, and the proportions that are given are huge. It's about two times larger than a regular burger, and it is filled with toppings. It's a must when you're in Scarborough."}
{"text":"after a night of partying........anytime before 3am..Johnny's is the place to go.  Their Banquet burger (bacon slices) is the perfect antidote to cure you're hunger after all that alcohol! the people are fast and efficient, and the staff knows what the client wants, especially for those regulars!! I would be heart broken if this place ever left, however its funny to see everything being newly built around it little Orange brick building...but i think its here to stay...Fries and gravy, onion rings, and Milk shakes are awesome! here comes JOhnny!"}
{"text":"I've lived all over the GTA and no matter how far the drive is, we drive to Johnny's.   Mouthwatering hamburgers To die for souvlaki on a bun Deep fried goodness of frings (fries and onion rings) with gravy on the side  Johnny's is a Scarborough legend. As such, there are certain guidelines I've learned through the years. Only order when you're ready. Don't stand at the cashier with your mouth open while staring at the menu. Trust me, you don't want to do that. Order quick and make sure you know what toppings you want. Then make yourself comfy sitting on what could be those old wooden gym benches. Your patience will be rewarded.  If it's warm out, you can sit outside on the picnic benches (good luck with that as they're always taken) or you can sit on the curb, in your car, on your car or just eat standing up. If it's cold, you're sitting in your car. Either way, you'll be happy.  4 for the food 3 for me never ever getting any picnic tables 5 for being so bad ass"}
{"text":"When you have friends or family visiting you from outside of Toronto you MUST bring them to Johnny's!  It's just one of those places that represents the Scarborough area. This place is open late... I would rather eat here than McDonald's if I had to choose late night meals  The prices have barely changed in years!  You gotta order a double cheeseburger it's your only option!  Are there better burgers out there?? For sure!! But this place is my go to when I want something fairly priced and want a good burger"}
{"text":"Good food. Went there with a friend and I ordered the cheese burger with onion rings and a peach drink they had. The burger was simple and good. Onion rings just how I liked it. Just remember that there is no lettuce as a condiment and there is no seating for customers. Also there is no debit so you have to walk with cash. It was busy when I was there and the staff were efficient in taking and making the orders. My friend and I waited for 5 minutes for food."}
{"text":"I will never understand the love for this place.  I think people like it by association with good times.  Most good reviews say after being out late and having a great time... So even the good reviews are not about johnny's they are about having fun then stopping here drunk for a bite, those shouldn't count.  There is even a review saying they got sick but the place was legendary, how is that possible?  Old is cool, I like a place that has history but this looks more run down than old and the meat in the burgers is so soft I imagine it was poured onto the grill.  I didn't find the prices out of this world and the taste was very middle of the road and one of the times I visited gave me well.. intestinal discomfort which seems to be common.  Maybe the soft meat reacts well to the right amount of alcohol and I just haven't experienced that but I think three tries is enough."}
{"text":"I know this is a Scarborough institution but I'll say from the start, I wasn't impressed. my biggest criticism is the meat, it's a little too soft for my taste. A burger patty should have some texture to it but this barely had any, it was just pur√©ed to the point that you question how much the meat vs. filler ratio is in the burger. It's more moist compared to a McDonald's burger, I'll give it that, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go there.   My best friend has told me for years he didn't like Johnny's Hamburgers at all, I can kinda see why now."}
{"text":"Johnny's burger's are probably one of the best burgers in Toronto that I've eaten. This is a family run restaurant and you need to pay with cash. From the outside, it looks like a dump but the burgers are actually really really good. Johnny's is literally a takeout restaurant as there are no tables or chairs to sit. People usually just go and eat in their cars. However, they can do this because their food is really good. Every time I have eaten here, I have not been disappointed. The burgers are extremely tender and seasoned just right. The entire burger itself is really big and 1 will usually fill most people. The fries are ok but it's called Johnny's Hamburgers. Not Johnny's Fries.  Usually around noon, the place is packed so if you can, go a little later or try and hit it up early. Especially if it's on a week day where everyone from work goes and gets a burger."}
{"text":"Honestly when you look at Johnny Burgers, you really wonder how this place stays afloat. (WAIT - JOHNNY FANS HEAR ME OUT I HAVE A POINT!). The exterior hasn't been touched in 30 years, (nor has the interior for that matter), the menu is the same, they don't have mayonnaise NOR do they have lettuce!!! However Johnny's has grown a mighty name for itself, a name that will never faze anyone from the looks of this place. When anyone in your group suggests Johnny's, there's no discussion, that's where you're going and no one ever disputes it!  However you'll find that when you make the trek there's never enough space to park and Johnny's customers spill out into the next 2 or 3 parking lots over to get their delicious square burgers. Mind you these customers are 90% of the time drunk and returning from their escapades in the downtown area but nonetheless, for many it's the MUST go to on the way home.  There's not much else I can say but to give these bad boys a try and add in a milkshake while your at it, they're extra thick!  IMPORTANT NOTE: Cash only! Though there's a TD and CIBC in close proximity."}
{"text":"A staple for Scarborough.  When I worked there ate many a burger/fries at Johnny's!  Good, fast, reliable.  Hopefully it sticks around a long time and if you want a burger in dirty Scarbs; this is a good place!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers amazing fries one of the places who still use potatoes and not fillers. They only take cash but prices are really low compared to other burger joints."}
{"text":"The Best burgers in town. So juicy!!!  I often order their hamburger combo with fries and drink for about $5.50 after taxes. Great place for lunch during summer time because you can eat outside on their picnic tables (if you find room).  This place has been in business for a very long time. There must be a good reason for that.  Unfortunately there is no place to sit and eat and parking is limited.   If I'm in the mood for a good burger, this is where I'll be."}
{"text":"Why all the hype, is not that good! I love that this place has been a staple in the neighborhood for years.  But lets be honest guys.  Their burger is your frozen processed Harveys patty.  Its not that good.  The only reason why this place is famous is because it is open in the till 4am so all the drunks can eat some slop on their way back north from Downtown Clubs and bars.  Its a fun place to visit at 3am, when everyone is hammered.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Best burger place in my opinion if you consider price and taste. I always see the staff working bright and early in the restaurant when I'm heading to work (7 a.m.), which shows me that they take this restaurant very seriously and the busyness of the restaurant on average obviously shows that. I usually get a hamburger with ketchup, mustard, mayo, garlic sauce, cooked onions, and tomatoes. It really hits the spot for $3.50. Great customer service too - \"Yes, my friend?\""}
{"text":"I remember coming here as a kid and have been dying to come back.  This is a Toronto original. Driving into the area and seeing that orange building with glowing orange sign and your eyes light up. Park it illegally on the sidewalk as there is never any parking here and run your ass over to the glass door towards the red and white paneled counter and place your order with the jagged old man who has been doing this his entire life. Take your number and sit on the indoor park bench while you wait for your burger to be cooked up and take in the sites and smells.   The smells are delicious but the sights - they could use some work, okay a lot of work. beige floor and wall tiles, wood trim on the walls, 70's inlay mirrors on the walls, and sun faded menu signs. At least there is a random picture of orcas in the cooking station to the right... weird.  Service here is pretty quick even when it's busy, not more than a 10min wait. Customer interaction? Who needs it when you got an orca picture to look at. Besides, the old dude that just took your money doesn't really want to talk to you anyway.   Hamburgers. These square puppies are good. Huge, moist, and topped well. Get the grilled onions as they are fantastic. I got everything on mine and couldn't be happier. The buns are nice and fluffy and steamed wonderfully, it's what really makes the burger. The onion rings are good too, nice and crispy with a thin layer of batter, put these guys IN the burger... mmmm. This is no gourmet burger so expect nothing fancy. Kicks the crap out of McDick's but don't come in snouty touty expecting the worlds greatest.  Overall, this place hits the spot. The prices are dirt cheap, $2.95 for a Hamburger and $3.35 for a cheeseburger of this size? Can't beat that value. I've had better burgers but the bang for buck is just so high I gave it that extra star. Eat it by the car illegally parked on the sidewalk so you could keep a look out for cops or tow trucks.  PS scrounge for change as they only take cash."}
{"text":"Johnny's Hamburgers is the single greatest name for a burger joint. Not only does it bring up every boy's nostalgic moment of eating frozen burger patties growing up, it also rocks the greatest name that God has blessed on this Earth. Unfortunately, the nostalgia doesn't affect me having grown up in tropical paradise my whole life and not the \"borough with the Scar\".  This burger joint is a tiny place that has no tables and barely enough on the bench. If you're looking to eat-in, you're going to look like a fool sitting on the floor. The menu is simple here. Get a burger or get out. They also have steak on a kaiser, hot dogs, shakes, and apparently fish and chips. The prices are so small that you pretty much understand why these patties are frozen.  Get the cheeseburger and fries ($6) and you're set. $3.50 for a cheeseburger is a cheap lunch and the fries here were actually pretty good. A part of me enjoyed my fries more than my burger. They were crisp and not at all greasy. The burger patty was not very good, but I like all the free toppings that come with them. Despite it all, the burger patty and bread didn't make for the best burger experience.   Service is quick though and the lineups get ridiculously long for a subpar burger. But I get it. People grew up on this stuff. Probably the same lubby dubby feeling I get when I see McDonald's McNuggets, despite the obvious lack of any taste for either. Open real late so if you can't decide what to eat (like me), you can make your way over. You should probably still expect a line..."}
{"text":"Burgers are tasty and the fries and gravy is awesome!  Busy place"}
{"text":"I remember when I was a kid my dad used to take us to Johnny's on the occasional Saturday. He used to grab a bunch of burgers and we'd open the trunk of the van and have a little picnic. GOOD TIMES.   Nothing has changed here, If you check out the pictures you feel as you've been transported back in time. I kinda like that, and nothing has really changed in terms of pricing. You can get a really decent meal here for under $10. I would say this beats every chain burger place like McDonalds & Burger King.   I ordered the Banquet Burger which is a 4oz patty with cheese and bacon. With over 2 million burgers sold, this place is still doing things the old school way. I obviously had to order Fries & Onion Rings. An older guy who's been there forever asked me what I would like on my burger, classic options only - ketchup, mustard, onion, and pickles.   I took my to-go container to the car, unwrapped my burger and it was really like going back in time. The bun was super soft, the meat was very juicy and soft and the toppings were all fresh. The fries were okay, but the Onion rings had a great crunch to it which I liked.   This isn't some gourmet burger shop, so don't except a triple AAA patty, but the quality of everything surpasses any other fast food joint for burgers.   Give it a try!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"The reputation exceeds this place.  The burgers are okay but I would like bigger patties.  It has an old fashioned feeling to it, but for a tiny parking lot and no place to sit and relax, I'll be eating burgers elsewhere."}
{"text":"You've got to be impressed by the way that this place refuses to change over the years, despite the gourmet burger boom and the fancy food trends in the city. They know what they are about and they stick to it.  Classic sizeable hamburgers with your choice of toppings, a good crunchy side in the form of fries or onion rings and fast friendly service. If you want to get fancy, buy a milkshake.  Simple, fresh and filling for under $10 most of the time. You even get to eat at your car to complete the retro vibes. Definitely turn into here over any of the fast-food conglomerates in the area."}
{"text":"Old school burger joint. Everything they make is good and cheap, but don't expect any \"gourmet\" style here. Also don't expect a sit down meal... this is to go only."}
{"text":"great burgers, great price and awesome staff.  these burgers really hit the spot. very traditional and simple, but delicious and exactly what you want.   the staff are also really nice. it was a pleasure eating here. i will definitely go again if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been going to Johnny's Hamburgers since I moved tom Toronto in 1979.  It is one of my family's favourite burger joints.  We save it far a treat, birthday, a special occasion or we just needed something special. The burgers, frys and onion rings, are great.  Just like the ones you could get when I was growing up at lots of places - before all the plastic Burger joints.  Mum long live johnny Burgerrs"}
{"text":"Burger was good and filling but after all the high reviews I was expecting more. Nothing you won't find at any other fast food burger joint. Price was reasonable though at $3.05"}
{"text":"Been a customer of Johnnys for the longest time. It's in my neighborhood so whenever I have a craving for a burger, it's my go to place and yet I haven't written a review on this place.   It's an old school burger joint, don't expect anything super fancy like the gourmet burger places all over the city. Affordable prices and decent food to satisfy a craving. They offer lunch special with a hamburger, fries and pop for 6$ up to 3pm which is an A-OK deal.   My usual is the hamburger with fries and cup of gravy. Since I've last been here, prices have increased slightly and menus have been upgraded. The taste has never changed. It is a thin beef patty served on a thin hamburger bun and there are select number of condiments offered (yes there is no lettuce). It definitely is simple but satisfying."}
{"text":"I don't know why I enjoy these burgers so much but they are certainly delicious.  This is one of my favourite burger joints during the summer but there is always a pretty long wait.  I've only ever had their cheeseburgers and fries and they have both been very very enjoyable.  It's definitely nothing fancy - at all.  If you want to go for fancy burgers, you shouldn't hang around here.  But if you just want a good, simple, old-fashioned quick burger, Johnny's hamburger is your place.  Price wise, they are very very reasonable.  You definitely get value for your money.  Just don't walk in with high expectations that you'll get a fancy whole wheat burger on an organic patty with avocado spread and havarti cheese or something...because you won't."}
{"text":"Well, it was definitely of a lower price than the famous burger joints in midtown/downtown. The burgers are definitely bigger as well, so I'll give them that.  Johnny's has been a longstand burger joint in Scarborough. I heard a lot about this place, especially when we're talking about top 10 burger places in Toronto. I finally had some time to visit this place earlier this week.  I ordered a double cheeseburger and a side of onion rings. The total came to $8.30 including tax; not bad! The burger was huge as well, so the value is there. It tasted quite good too. However the onion rings were honestly nothing special. They're pretty much the same level as Harveys in my opinion, which isn't amounting to much.  Service wasn't too great, though looking at the reviews I seemed to had the better end of the stick. So it could've been worse?  As for me visiting back, if I don't feel like going to the core I wouldn't mind being a regular here. I don't eat burgers too often though unless absolutely necessary."}
{"text":"Um famos√≠ssimo lanche por essas redondezas! Vale experimentar! Sem lugar para sentar por√©m o atendimento √© r√°pido, bem eficiente. Voc√™ escolhe o que quer colocar no seu p√£o com Hamburguer e o cara monta pra voc√™ todo caprichado. Eles inovaram - come√ßando muitos anos atr√°s quando abriram a hamburgueria - colocando um molho de nome Tzatziki. T√≠pico da Gr√©cia e da Turquia, tem ervas e especiarias com base de iogurte. (√â bem gostoso!) Outro diferencial da empresa √© o Hamburguer, que √© caseiro e bem gostoso. Tirei uma estrela pois realmente faz falta algumas mesas pra poder comer por l√° mesmo."}
{"text":"Cheap big and filling burgers, reminds me of a harveys where they ask you what toppings u want although they do not have lettuce...onion rings are pretty good for 2 bucks Mind u it's a take out place   This place is good for a late night munchies"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a little girl and I never get tired of it. The food is always good. The decor has been the same for as long as I remember and I don't think it takes away from it at all. It wouldn't be Johnny's without that distinctive orange building."}
{"text":"Did I just step into the 50's? Johnny's is a staple of the Vic Park-Sheppard area, but this was my first time to this groovy joint. The decor is simple...roll in order, sit down on the bench to wait and roll out.   The burgers were decent and you get to choose your toppings. All the regulars are there are at the party; ketchup, mustard, relish, sauteed onions, onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. I like the customization you get with this burger, it's kind of like Harvey's. The fries were fresh, but not as crispy as I would have like. The surprise of the meal was the onion rings. They were crispy and delicious, greasy but satisfying."}
{"text":"I think this place surfs on the nostalgia of its patrons. Must have been really great back in the day... But not TODAY. Burger was frozen, kind of mushy once cooked. No thrill."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is great.  They have a lunch special where you can get a combo for $6 and honestly, you can't even get a combo at McDonald's for that price. This place's burgers are definitely a lot better than McDonald's too.  This is mainly a grab-and-go kind of place; there's not much of a parking lot and there's not much of a seating area inside either.   If you're looking for a burger to fill you up, this is the place! If you want a gourmet burger, I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, yes it look like s*it - it's worth the trip inside.  It's like they are the original Harvey's!  Flame broiled, juicy, and so big!  The burgers are made fresh and are customized when you order it.  For around $6 you get fries and a drink and add another couple bucks and you can get a HUGE bacon cheese burger.  If it's a nice day, take your number and sit outside on the bench, cause trust me, it's gonna get busy if it isn't already, if not sit in your car, or try and cram on the bench inside the tiny store.  Once you get your burger, have a seat at one of the park benches at the back, or in your car to eat it - trust me, it's not a eat and drive burger like Mc Donald's is - you need two hands for this sucker.  Every time I've had a Johnny's burger combo I'm stuffed for the rest of the day.  It's well worth the money and it's so yummy."}
{"text":"- Late night tradition to come to Johny's - Charcoal grilled Burgers are simple yet very tasty and at 2A.M. it hits the spot ! - Service is amazing. The staff have been there forever - Fries with gravy, chocolate milkshake are must orders - Pro tip : They're closed on Sundays. Always made that mistake."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times over the last 10 years. This place is a staple in the scarborough area. You'll find a line up any time you go, even late at night, or especially late at night. the same guys   It was one of my first good/memorable burgers. While I have had many great burgers from my first experience at johnny's until now, it still holds for me. Beyond nostalgia, I still really enjoy this burger. Its a simple burger and its very cheap. They have a no frills type of service but they are efficient and have an old school charm to it. Probably offensive to some people now, but they call all the girls \"maria\" when you are picking your toppings.   Ordering system is simple. You line up, you order, you get a number. They call your number and you pick your toppings for your burger: tomatoes, onions (raw and grilled), relish, pickles... No lettuce. Don't ask for it, or you'll get a comment back. its always been like that and I suppose has become part of the charm.   Cheese burger, double burger, banquet burger...they're all good. The fries and onion rings are awesome as well. Shakes are delicious. I can't comment on the hot dogs or the steak on a bun etc. as I've never ventured to order those....I don't think I've actually heard anyone order those. The burger is where its at.   Theres no seating. Most people eat in their cars or around their cars in the summer. Theres a picnic bench in the back during the summer. Overall a great place for a quick, no frills, bite."}
{"text":"Theres a popular consensus that Johnny's served great burgers --- even better when consumed under the influence. Personally, I've never had their signature product while inebriated but I'm convinced all the good things I've heard about Johnny's were either from people who did not know what makes a good burger or perma-drunk because these burgers are probably among the worst I've had.  This is yet another place I really wanted to love based on its long history and had this been a new joint in town and they served the same mediocre product, I would have ranted long and hard but I'm giving Johnny's 2 stars simply for the throwback feeling. Take away the bright orange exterior and old decor with nowhere to enjoy your meal and you've basically got a very bad and overpriced burger place. The patties are horribly soft with the very apparent taste of filler and the lack of lettuce seriously bothers me. Service was also lacking and my burger was served with a frown. Honestly if you put a gun to my head and asked me to choose between Johnny's and McDs I'd go with the latter because at least service would have been better. Let's just hope I'm never forced to pick between the lesser of two evils in real life."}
{"text":"Really overrated. I went 15 yrs ago and then went 6 months ago and now I know why I didn't return. Patties are not very high quality imho. Staff is really nice though."}
{"text":"Been around forever, and famous for the owner calling every female that walks in \"Maria\", Johnny's is an institution.  It's a great place, really cheap, great shakes, great onion rings, good gravy and the burgers are good (though they have declined a bit over the years). Beware though, burgers have no lettuce - but instead they add taztiki and a toasted bun. Yeah it's good."}
{"text":"Johnnys is pretty good.  I'd choose Johnnys over Real MCcoys at Markham and Ellesemere.  I like that their burgers are short and straight to the point, none of that puffiness in the buns.  Secondly, the onion rings are just right.  Not too over cooked, not too brown but very original and cooked just right.  Haven't tasted the fries but seen them, they're just normal fries.  However, Real MCcoys has home cut fries which id prefer than Johnnys fries.  But yet MCcoys has that unwanted puffiness in the buns.  Overall, Johnnys is the way to go."}
{"text":"This is a great burger joint with home made milkshakes. The menu is simple with things like burgers, hot dog, fries, onion rings, poutine, milkshakes and fountain pop. The only reason I m not giving a 5 star review is because the fries are frozen and not fresh cut. Onion rings are nice and thick. Staff is friendly and seem happy. It's always busy when I go here but the service is speedy, the staff is organized and communicate well with one another."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries and gravy. Real ice cream milk shakes. Good value. Famous place, always customers, the line moves at a good tilt."}
{"text":"Price. Good. Bun. GOOD. Size. GOOD. Meat. GOOOOOOOODDDD  IOW: Nice no-frills, no nonsense classic burger place."}
{"text":"2 juicy cheese burgers with a side order of fries came up to $10.20 and Monday night seemed to end beautifully...because of Johnny!!!  They've served their fair share of legendary meat to enough carnivores earning the level of a black belter in grill fill and the price is right!  The staff is uniformed in an 80s diner feel and even with the grim and forced smiles serving patrons, I felt lost yet hunger brought me back to my senses. I'm sure none of them were thrilled yet I felt the genuine joint effort in avoiding eye contact longer than 3 seconds which made serving time snappy and me, happy!  Johnny be good! 'Twas to me."}
{"text":"Johnys is the best non franchise burger joint in Toronto. I've discovered it over 7 years ago and they have been consistently amazing. They are a family business and on the wall you can see articles about them. Their toppings are simple, but the best is their fried onion!! Burgers are massive and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I was obsessed with coming here for hamburgers for a long while. They're just so cheap and so delicious and they're open whenever you want one.   Definitely something to check out if you're looking for a late bite or even if you just want to try some good hamburgers!  I recall that there was a lot of construction behind there which made it a bit difficult to park and to go by but I'm not sure if that's been cleared up yet"}
{"text":"omg, the best quick burger joint in the GTA -- and they're open late on friday and saturday  no wonder it's mike myer's favourite burger in t.o! it's mine too! ~ 4 bucks, no combo gets you bitefuls of nostalgic charcoal bursts of flavour -- even in the dead of winter i feel like i'm sitting on a porch eating a fresh burger off the grill.  don't expect a place to sit, or a place to stand though -- it's like a drive through without the drive through -- haha, as in you need to park, and walk in, order, get your burger and leave. but i usually devour my burger within 2 mins in the car or outside in the parking lot anyway... it's that good   the only thing weird about the condiments is that they don't offer lettuce. i know.. strange, but i guess it cuts down on their labour costs and if you don't order fast enough they get mad at you like the soup natzi but i'm also a purest,  so tomatoes, and ketchup, is plenty :) (unless they offer grilled onions, but they don't but they do have raw chopped red onions)  highly recommended! :) yay!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the East end of Scarborough and often when I was out with friends downtown and coming home late, we'd stop at Johnny's on the way home. It was the thing to do and we always loved hanging out in the parking lot enjoying our burgers and shakes.  I had an occasion to come back here today and have one for old times sake. The burger didn't taste as good as I remembered, but it was still great.  Be warned...know what you want before you line up. There's no delaying the order line."}
{"text":"So good! Love the bread they use for their burgers. Poutine is to die for! At lunch they gave a special for less than $7.   Not much room to eat here so you'll have to do take out."}
{"text":"This place is a classic, and it's been around as long as I can remember. I recently had a chance to visit, and it was as great as I remembered.  Is this place the best burger place in Toronto? No - not really...but it's the best $4 cheeseburger that I've had in a long time! The bun was a little too big for the burger, but that was simply solved by ripping off the excess. The fries were pretty good too, and cheap as well. During the week they have a lunch special for $6 which I'll have to come back and take advantage of. Service was very friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my order to come up. Parking situation is abysmal and you can only access the restaurant from the same side of the street, but with some careful manoeuvring I managed to get in and out unscathed. Also is nice to support the little locals!"}
{"text":"Good Burgers, tomatoes were actually healthy looking had colour.  (seems like a rarity for sliced tomatoes)  Really Good Milkshakes, your can taste the ice cream, (I got chocolate ) but the fries and onion rings are frozen nothing special. Would go back for the burger and shakes, forget the fries. Price was good too."}
{"text":"Love this place...Fast and friendly service and the milkshakes are awesome!  To the people that like swanky burgers,  (hero burger, craft burger, etc.) you'd probably expect too much out of this place so don't add yourself to the already long line-up (and to each their own, of course).  There is and never has been lettuce offered as a topping so get over the no-lettuce gripe.  Fried onions as a topping is a bonus.   Fries with gravy actually means that there is gravy on every fry. Not just dumped on top like other establishments."}
{"text":"Delicious souvlaki! It's like heaven in your mouth! And reasonable price so it's definitely recommended. It's a takeout place so there aren't many seats other than a bench. Staffs are all very nice and funny!"}
{"text":"I have being going to Johnies for 20 years and the prices are quite good. However , they are getting very stingy with the add ons like pickles, tomatoes and relish. It is the only thing I really enjoyed to enhance the burger. However , I will say they have upsized my milkshake when I ordered a small one and wanted the big one for no charge. Otherwise they make the best burg In these parts of Scarberia."}
{"text":"Love this place with all my heart.  Been going since the 1990's.  Prices have hardly increased, only to match inflation, really.  Hope it never closes down.  I don't drink soda, but always order one with my cheeseburger and fries/gravy just to spend a bit more there, cuz they deserve it!"}
{"text":"A Scarborough Staple!  This place brings back memories whenever I'm back home.  Awesome burgers and perfectly fried fries!  Their milkshakes are also awesome!  Love the fact that they have tzatiki for their burgers.  Yummmy!  There is usually a line-up but it's definitely worth the wait.  The service is always quick and always with a genuine smile.  Definitely a must visit in the East end of Toronto!"}
{"text":"A great iconic landmark for Scarborough.  The are known for their short tempered service and blunt remarks, which make this place a free entertainment zone as well. I love bringing new people to this place, to see how they get dealt wtih.   Ask them for lettuce on your buger, hahaha. They will ask you if you want a burger or a salad? Cause they dont offer lettuce as a topping.   Love Johnnys."}
{"text":"They have my favorite burgers! And fairly priced. A must go restaurant in Scarborough area if you like old style burgers."}
{"text":"I recommend: the regular hamburger (double up!)  One night I had a dream that I was on a mountain of Whoppers, happily devouring a Whopper in my hand (I'm serious). That's how much I loved the Whopper. I know..there's better burgers out there, but I wasn't exactly a fan of burgers or a burger hunter at the time. Until I met this little burger joint. My eyes were finally opened to the world of Burgers! After our first visit here, we came back again and again...And again...You HAVE to double up your burger for the BEST experience here, even if you can't finish it! Their hamburger is delicious and so cheap ($3 something). We always order 2 coke + 2 double burgers with ketchup, little bit of relish, and extra mayo. Mmmm...  I don't care about service here, I just want my burger! Service here is not exceptional, but it's not horrible. The guys that work here rarely smile. I guess if you're working all day, dead tired with an oily face you wouldn't be smiling either.  Great thing about this place is that they open super late. I think they close at 3am. If you come during that time, surprisingly you'll still see quite a bit of people here. Lunch time is the worst time to come. Oh the line!  There's a bench in the back if you want to dine there. Or just eat in your car - that's what we do. Their parking lot is very small, but there's additional parking right beside them. (I believe it's for Shoppers).   So the next time you're craving for a late night snack or a delicious, juicy burger - forget Mcdonalds.. Come here!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why I waited years to come here. My wife decided to buy me a burger there and damn...  Based on the price, quality and size of the burger. I'm giving this place a 5/5!  I think she got me a double patty hamburger and it was good enough to keep going for a couple hrs. It was delicious in every way and think it was about 6.00...cannot complain.   The good: Great place stop by after work for a good burger. Food is good it will release your inner stress! Price is good. Quality and portion is good.  Here's the bad: There's no place to sit and eat.  I heard the veal was good but they don't have veal anymore.   Thanks kimoneatz@gmail.com"}
{"text":"Why I have not heard about this place before continues to baffle me especially since I work near the area. Maybe the shoppers drug mart covers this gem.   Anyways the burgers are huge! $3.30 for a classic burger $3.80 for a cheese and $4.75 I think for the banquet burger. For toppings you get onions pickles tomatoes relish and your normal burger dressings but no lettuce for some strange reason.   I took one star off because of service. They could be a bit more friendlier!   Will return again...."}
{"text":"What can I say about Johnny's??? I loveeee this place so much that my fiance and I go up there at least 3 times a week. And we even got his mom and sister hooked on Johnny's... Burgers, fries, onion rings, gravy, steak on a bun.. Its all good... 5 stars all the way!! And 5 more stars for the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"\"Steak on a kaiser and strawberry shake because you can get a burger anywhere.\"  This restaurant is up the street from where I work and I have been here a number of times.    Though they have a wide selection of things to order, for some reason I always get a steak on a kaiser and a strawberry shake.  Seem to recall onion rings once and they were pretty good.  On the kaiser I tend to get mayo, grilled onions, ketchup.  Medium well.  Sort of place to go to celebrate something or I need a pick me up or what have you.  As I stated above, I can get a burger anywhere, but a steak on a kaiser?  As it has been for decades, an extremely small driveway (however, with Shoppers ScamMart building on the corner, I suspect many now are parking in their driveway as it wraps around this restaurant).  No seats inside or out - might be a lone picnic table there still.  So you go to pickup and eat elsewhere.  You order and they give you a tagged number, then they call it.  Lines can be daunting but they always are quite efficient so things move quickly enough.  Will update the review as things change."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in Scarborough. I've seen this place opened in years and I never tried Johnny's Hamburgers until today.   I have ordered 1 Double Cheese Burger +  1 Chicken Burger. The total price came up to $10.75 with tax included. Great deal!  The double cheese burger tasted divine. Great texture and charboiled flavour. The chicken burger... wasn't my cup of tea, but wow..... that double cheese burger... alone was worth my $10.75.  For sure I will visit this place again.  From this day on, whenever I am around the area and craving some delicious beef burgers, Johnny's Hamburgers is the way to go.  I would highly suggest everyone to try out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I grew up with this place!  The burgers have always been filling.  I remember the burgers being even better years ago.  That may be my childhood memories building them up.  The service is more exacting and abrupt than when I was a kid.  I wish it was more like I remember and the only reason I share this is the hope that the owners read this and start having fun again!  I guess after all these years, it starts to get monotonous.  The burgers are tasty, the fries are good and the gravy has depth.  Good to see they are there after all these years.  I wish they would consider expanding with other locations!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Johnny's Burgers since I was a kid. It's been several years since my family has moved out of the area and the surroundings have definitely changed but Johnny's Hamburgers has always been consistently delicious! It's not a very big space in the actual storefront so probably best to park along the side or at the back and eat your burger in the car since there's also no outdoor seating.  Their standard hamburger is always my go-to, although I've also tried their souvlaki and veal on a kaiser, both of which are also delicious. Like a real hamburger place, fries and drinks are sold separately. I like the crispness of the fries. They also serve milkshakes which are perfect for summer days.  Several of their line cooks and workers have been and are still at Johnny's Burgers so it's nice to see familiar faces even after all this time has passed. Staff is always friendly and service is quick. They open every day at 10:30am and close at 1:00am on weekdays and 3:00am on weekends."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to go to Johnny's Hamburgers and grab a burger for lunch.   Maybe after reading all these reviews I came with high expectation and was a little disappointed.  The Hamburger ($3.05) I order is ok... not too bad but I definitely have much better one! I found the patty does not have a lot of bite. The bun did not toasted enough so it got a little soggy by the time I eat that. The cooked onion as one of the free toppings is a nice touch if you like onions...  Onion Rings ($2.10) is A-OK. The batter is light and was not too greasy.  BTW, they do have lunch specials for $5.24 Monday to Friday 11:00-3:00 pm will get you a burger/fries/drink.  I did get a really good smiling service... the guy that took my order even trying to practise his limited Chinese with me :) and they were all really friendly. Maybe because the place was not too busy when I was there?  Will I go again?? Maybe... since I find the lunch special is quite a good deal and it is good to have a change from eating Asian food all the time! :)"}
{"text":"Had the burger, fries, and a strawberry shake. Every thing is individually priced, with no combos. However, everything is still reasonably priced.   As to the taste of the food, it's not any different than what you'd get from your standard backyard bbq.   Service is quick and efficient,  and seems like a pretty popular place for the neighborhood. Perfect for when you want that hit of not-so-healthy food.   Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's Charcoal Broiled Hamburger is one of the oldest eatery in Scarborough.  The charcoal broiled beef patty has added a level of smokiness to the burger. The fried onion offers additional sweetness to the savouriness of the beef. Sadly, Johnny's Burger discriminates against lettuces. Lettuces have the magical ability to brighten flavours. As a lover of textures, I also missed the crisp texture of fresh lettuce. While I cannot comment on the overall quality of the food (as I question legitimacy of the burger's \"beef content\"), when you dine at Johnny's Burger, you are eating a (bright orange) part of Scarborough's history."}
{"text":"This is a good burger joint, but it's really similar to the Harvery's next door. To be honest if they served lettuce (like any other burger joint) and added a few more toppings available I would give it a 4. The lack of toppings is a shame for a burger joint, I've had many better burgers. It may be time to retire this place, although I will miss it, for memories sake."}
{"text":"Iconic staple of late nights and post entertainment eats, I inaugurated my 10 year old into Johnny Burgers after he returned from summer camp.  Simply put you get a reliable beef burger on a tasty bun with all the fixin's and perfectly  seasoned fries along with a pop or a shake all at prices that haven't changed in decades.  The decor is unchanged too, and that's why it's so popular. Simple menu, great tasting food, great prices, efficient staff... I hope this place never changes.  My one complaint is the inconvenient parking set up. Not much space at front and it's a one way drive, you need to go all the way around to exit... but this is a minor annoyance at best."}
{"text":"Strangely enough after 2 years working in the area, I decided to try out his place. This place has cheap burgers and fries. It definitely has an old school vibe. I ordered a burger, fries and a milkshake. The milkshake was a little disappointing as it was not creamy enough. The strawberry flavour was the worst, good thing I ordered chocolate. I don't think I will come to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food for great prices!! Came here on Friday night, around 9:30 and the place was really busy, and only got busier! Service is quick, but almost rushing you. Understandable, given the amount of people waiting to order and receive their food.  I got a hamburger, my friend got a cheeseburger, and we split a poutine and vanilla milkshake. The food tasted super good, all in all we were probably in and out in 15 minutes? The food is best hot (of course) and they have long pickles, not the small circle ones, which is nice. They also have a choice of caramelized onions and raw onions to put on your burger (i got everything on mine!) and the poutine looked beautiful, even though they DO use shredded cheese here and not cheese curds.   We paid about $17 for our food altogether, and we were very full by the end, which was great! Three things of note, however. There is next to no seating space. We ate in the car but we watched many many people do the same around us, and that kinda sucks in the Winter.  Also, we ordered a strawberry milkshake at the counter, but I'm pretty sure we were given a vanilla instead (which is fine because we were going to change our order to a vanilla, but didn't and it tasted awesome anyways).  Lastly, maybe this can be attributed to my slightly sensitive stomach, as my friend didn't have any problems at all, but the food seemed to digest...a little too quickly, if you catch my drift.  All in all I would definitely go back here if I'm in the area! Love the \"poutine\" and the burgers aren't bad for about $4 each!"}
{"text":"Went there again for their Souvlaki again.  A VERY LITTLE bit disappointed this time around.  It just wasn't as good as the last time (some time last week), I think it may have been slightly undercooked, just slightly.  It was during the lunch rush so it may have added to the rush job.  Overall I still would go there again.  My other usual order there is the \"double steak on a kaiser' but I didn't really feel like taking anything that heavy lately.  I'm still not really impressed with their burgers, so if you want a plain burger, I don't recommend this place.  Whatever you order, make sure you add their fried onions.  Considering I hate onions, I really like their friend onions."}
{"text":"If you talk about tradition,  this is THE place.   Johnny's has been open for a long time and they still have the same staff and same food, but just slightly more expensive.  The food here is always great, sometimes fries can come cold,  but when you go many times it will happen.  The environment is so welcoming and the employees make you feel as if you were home.   To simply put it: if you want a good meal at a good price. Come here. You will never be disappointed"}
{"text":"The classic - 50 years going I think. Open late and for under $10 easy, you get the full spread. None of that lettuce on those burgers, a shake to pair, gravy and fries. Done."}
{"text":"If you want to eat a burger and fries, come here. Best bang for your dollar.   No lettuce for the burger because that's for a salad.  Won't be disappointed unless you want organic beef. In which case, you shouldn't be eating a burger"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger, regular fries and a chocolate shake. Their service is a no-nonsense approach. I didn't expect much from the shake but it had enough flavour. Not too creamy which I didn't like but at least it wasn't overly sweet or watery. The patty on the burger isn't as good as Lick's but it was quite juicy tasting, definitely not dry. I didn't feel like it was frozen at all. The toppings sans lettuce are very basic but they were fresh. The fries weren't anything spectacular, just average. The prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back when I'm craving a burger that isn't overpriced like some burger franchises."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my Johnny's experience. I had high expectations because it was on a bunch of \"best burger\" lists for the city but left unsatisfied.  We didn't have to wait long for our order and the service was about what I expected - not friendly but not unfriendly. There is nothing fresh about the burger. It seemed like it had been frozen and thawed and it had little flavor. Toppings were OK, nothing complicated so its hard to mess up. The fries were horrible. No seasoning and very soggy.  I will not give Johnny's a second chance. There are so many better places to grab a burger in the city."}
{"text":"Been going to Johnny's for for almost four decades! How does time fly and my arteries have not clogged and failed - Yet! The formula is simple, grill them what they want and charge a reasonable price for it. When a McD's combo costs more than a Burger, Fries and Drink from Johnny's, you have to think - QQF!?!  (QQF = french version of WTF) Besides a new counter top and a new sign, I think the place is still the same. The food is still the same - probably the same charcoal and oil too! LOL! If you want the old style burger joint that has a bunch of guys doing the Olympia Cafe schtick from Saturday Night Live \"cheeseburger, cheeseburger, no coke - pepsi!\" (well they have coke here) head on down and get a bit of entertainment with your meal. Not a culinary destination but I'm magnetically drawn here every time I'm doing an West to East run across the highway! The Thrill of the Grill!"}
{"text":"Want a quick hamburger with efficient service even late night, here's your spot! The east end connection for late night lives here! Someone guy is a bit too quick, so slow him down to get it the way you want it! Overall a great take out joint!"}
{"text":"Johnny's is a landmark. Tons of memories, not always the best. The go to place after a night out or working late.   Nostalgia for all us guys that grew up around here to have an incredibly late night burger served by some incredibly miserable guys. Don't get me wrong - if you're use to that sort of thing growing up around these guys - you are now home!  Summary - Ok non home-made everything made the old fashioned 'cheeseburger-cheeseburger' way."}
{"text":"$3.50 for a burger with onions, mushrooms and ketchup and mustard and mayo? Why would I complain. Johnnys is a very 90's type of take out bigger joint, I love how they open late, and is take out only, they also have thick shakes that kind you find at Johnny rockets(I know the names are similar but the price is so different and the diner vs take out. I vote take out.) This place is closed on Mondays but I won't complain, the parking is a bit limited so in busy nights is a bummer and hard to get to during rush hour. However, that doesn't stop me when I have a burger fixing."}
