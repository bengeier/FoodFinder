{"text":"They had an open buffet.. line of waiting was so long and by the time i reach food was already gone.. no refill what so ever.

Paid 35 dollars per person to eat french fries and management even did not apologies accusing me that i was late!! (10 minutes after opening the buffet the food was gone)"}
{"text":"They serve hooka (shisha) in a closed environment with poor ventilation for KIDS BIRTHDAYS! I have no idea how they pass the health inspection. As you walk in, you are greeted with a disgusting smell of tobacco and charcoal. We left with a headache caused by all the second hand smoke."}
{"text":"I was quite excited when I saw this place in the plaza. Didn't intend to go but I couldn't help it. I like to expand my food knowledge and wanted to try some Dubai food. I'm a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine but have never visited a place with \"Dubai\" food.

I went in to get takeout. The menu was a bit puzzling. I kept trying to find something special that I can't find elsewhere, like a Dubai specialty. Nope. I couldn't find. I was hoping to at least see some grilled kabobs or mandi or some ethnic specialty. Nope. They have shawarma and wrap version of shawarma, manakeesh and that's about it. The rest of the menu is occupied by stuff like chicken supreme or franchisco beef. Or even Mexican chicken. They also have pizza with a middle eastern touch. Pretty sure these aren't native Dubai dishes.

I ordered the soujouk sandwich and the sausage pan appetizer as these are the closest \"unique\" things I can find on the menu. Both were very underwhelming. The sausage pan only had about 5 pieces of sausages. It was mostly fries. I paid $10 for fries and 5 scrawny bite sized sausages. I could taste only a little bit of the pomegranate sauce. The sandwich could have used more meat. It had very little toppings. I feel it could have been improved with more meat and stuffing. This was also about $10. Taste wise they were just \"ok\". The meat in the sandwich tastes like the meat you find on Turkish Pide.

I would pay maybe $7 at most for the sausage pan and about $7 for the sausage. So I'd say this place is quite overpriced. Their shawarma plate is a whopping $16. From the picture it looks about the same stuff you can get elsewhere for about $10-13. I don't think I'll come back to see if it's worth it."}

{"text":"Came here to order a chicken shawarma wrap to go. The menu stated \"chicken shawarma wrap with lettuce and pickles. 8$\" okay fine, 8 dollars is a little higher priced than your average Mississauga shawarma. 
Thinking they would offer more toppings for my wrap, HE LITERALLY ONLY PUT CHICKEN, LETTUCE, AND PICKLES. THE WRAP WAS AS THICK AS A BABIES ARM. FOR 8 f*kin DOLLARS. wtf??? As you can see with my photo, THERE ARE NO VEGETABLES OR MORE SAUCES. Wow. 
Ive been to every possible Shawarma place in Sauga, each one offering massive wraps with endless veggies and sauces to offer between 5-7 bucks. 
 
They tried to explain to me thats how it works. All I heard was \"this is how we cheap out on our food and take peoples money.\" I will not contribute to a business that think they can get away with selling mediocre chicken slices and f*cking lettuce in a pita bread.

First time to this place and the first time I ever had to ask for a refund."}

{"text":"Came here for shisha during Arabic night. There's live music so there was a good crowd and a lively atmosphere. Since it was our first time here, we ordered grape mint shisha as that is our barometer to see if it is good. We were happy with it and the charcoal cubes were a plus. 

We also decided to order some food and tried the akawi cheese manakeesh as well as their minted lemon drink. The manakeesh was tasty and had the right amount of cheese on a thin crust. The minted lemon drink was delicious and tasted like a mojito slushie. 

Now the service is what brings this place down for me. Our food came out fairly quickly but it took 20 mins or so for our shisha to arrive. The table beside us were seated after and received their shisha in about 5 mins. We flagged down our server and it still took at least another 10 mins. When we were asking for a refill on coals we flagged down a server who was walking around with them and he saw us and promptly walked past us to refill other tables. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican Chicken platter with salad instead of rice and fries, but for some reason they assumed salad and coleslaw is the same thing. 
The coleslaw was good though but the chicken was under seasoned and looked like no effort was put in it. 

My friend ordered the Shish tawook which was decent."}
{"text":"I was in the area, in a rush  and in the mood  for a quick small snack. I noticed that the space  formerly occupied by Nader's  Middle Eastern  was replaced by a new restaurant named Toshka  - Taste of Dubai.  Anything that is new I like to check out 
It's just opened  I believe a couple of days and looking at the menu saw that it's filled with  a combination of  middle eastern and Western dishes. . 
Since I'll be  doing a long workout tomorrow. I settled  on the garlic bread without cheese .
It came well presented on a wooden plate with some  tomato and olives. It was hot and soft and I ate and left .. Service is typical of an newly opened  restaurant  in that  they are good but get better over time .
My only disappointment is that there is no takeout
I saw some dishes on the menu that I will definitely try when I bring my friends  such as the Toshka sandwich,  and shish tawook ( chicken  sandwich )"}
