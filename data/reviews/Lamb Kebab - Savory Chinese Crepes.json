{"text":"Get your jian bing fix on. Just trying to decide if I prefer them for lunch, breakfast, or late night snack"}
{"text":"Yummy, affordable and crispy Chinese crepes. They can only make 2 at a time though so lines/waits can be long."}
{"text":"This little stand makes THE BEST jianbing I have had outside of Beijing/Tianjin for a decent price.  $4 for one.  $.50 for extra egg, $1 for ham, $.50 for shredded pork floss.  It is one of the best price for Toronto.  Love it.  Like being on China.  I hope he always stays in business."}
{"text":"I tried a few Chinese crepes in other places (including T&T) and they just weren't quite right, so I came back here. These are without a doubt the best in Toronto. Perfect balance of crispy and chewy with fresh lettuce. Ask for extra sauce to get closer to perfection ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing little kiosk in the sidewalk on the north side of Dundas on the east side of Spadina. I tried the taiyaki, which is a cute little crepe type of Japanese dessert filled with red bean, green tea, or pineapple. Tasty and warm! And I also tried their BBQ which was good as well. They have several different meats on a stick but my fav was the Philippine sausage, yummy!
After standing there (no seating) for a few minutes, it was obvious I have to return soon to try the Chinese savoury crepes which look very good. It's a crepe coated with egg as it cooks, and wrapped around a crispy cracker with lettuce and some sauces. It's from northern China and people were telling me they come from Mississauga to seek out one of these delightful looking snacks. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The portion is so small that 4 of their skews is probably the same amount of meat of one skewer from other places."}
{"text":"This place now has a new owner, which brings us higher price, slow service, and bad quantity and taste.

They definitely cheaper out the meat they put on chicken and lamb skewer.. also they don't taste good.

It's quite disappointing because I used to like this little shop before they change the owner."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but as a previous review mentioned it's gone downhill after the change of ownership. Bought a crepe as a late snack (so I wasn't that hungry tbh) and had to throw it out because it tasted so bad. The lady making the crepe also used the same hand she touched money with to bag the crepe. Gross."}
{"text":"If you want something to eat something quick this place have yummy Chinese crepes. They also have taiyaki(Japanese fish-shaped cake) and BBQ sticks. 

The crepe was $4, it was made in front of you and you can add additional egg($.50),dried meat floss($.50) or ham($1). It was filling. The matcha taiyaki was an interesting flavor, I ate it half an hour later after so it didn't taste as good. I would definitely come back to when I visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The first time my bf and I discovered it, we did the 40 min trek from our place 3 times that week cuz we couldn't get enough. Now whenever we eat out at Chinatown, we save a little room so we can share a crepe and/or a Taiyaki on the walk home. Not the healthiest habit, but soooo yummy."}
{"text":"The Jianbing here is absolutely delightful. It had just the right amount of sweet and spicy sauce. The crunch from the lettuce and crispy cracker was a great contrast to the soft and chewy crepe. You can't beat that for the price. Too bad I live in NYC. There are a few places that have it but it's triple the cost. I might have to find my way back to Toronto soon just for my Jianbing fix. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was casually just browsing yelp while I was on the streetcar when I came across this stand. Intrigued by the positive reviews I decided to give this stand a try. The woman who took my order spoke absolutely no English. Despite the language barrier she still communicated well through lots of pointing. 

Decided to order the savoury crepe with ham. Crepe was prepared in front of me. It was made quickly with a great amount of finesse. Definitely a good crepe but .5 star because of the lack of ham. Overall 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Always drop by here when I'm walking on Spadina. The lamb skewers are flavourful and delicious. I like them a little spicy. The beef skewers are also decent, but I prefer the lamb ones as they are fatter and less dry. Skewers are 10 for $12. This is relatively cheap compared to the ones you get at chinese night markets. 

Service here is great. It's always the same lady or man working here. They are extremely friendly and nice. 

I only come here for the skewers but they also sell crepes and bubble tea. It's also priced really cheap! Maybe next time I'll try the crepes. They are freshly made on the spot and look pretty delicious."}
