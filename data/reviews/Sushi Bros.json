{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Relaxed atmosphere, great food and even better service. I'll make this my go to Sushi stop in Phoenix! I think my faves are the orange and cherry blossom but the sweet thing is a right there with them."}
{"text":"There is a reason that %99.99 of the reviews are positive great sushi and not just great sushi for the price but great sushi and then you see the price and cant believe that its so cheap for such good sushi , the staff should get 6 stars cause they are genuinely nice people with great attitudes , this is our hidden gem sushi spot , but if everyone tryed this place once they would be hooked . Sushi bros your awesome"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, was not disappointed.  The sushi was very good, place was clean, service was very good and we did not have to wait a long time for our meal.  We will definitely be going back.  One of the other reviews said best kept sushi secret in town, we totally agree."}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided we wanted sushi for lunch on our lunch break. This was down the street and reviews were good so tried it out. Not super busy when we went at 1pm, which for us was good. Sushi was fresh and tasted great. Came out with good timing. Loved they way it looked inside. Waitress was very nice. To look at the outside you would think it would be a bit sketch but complete opposite. Plus they have happy hour all day. We will be going back"}
{"text":"Sushi was good and the price was even better. Staff was friendly. However, the place has a smell that took me a while to adjust to, like cigaret smoke. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bros doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let the dodgy strip mall fool you. It's cute, clean and yummy inside! My husband and I went out to celebrate, and had the totally awesome surprise of stuffing ourselves full on totally delicious and reasonably priced sushi during happy hour! (7:30pm-close) + 10% off in-house dining? Heck yeah! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quite unexpected. Love this place, sometimes eat here 2 times a week. Unexpected due to location but absolutely delicious. Friendly staff and super affordable. Can't beat the prices and quality anywhere for great sushi."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place we've gone to so far! Clean, smells good, fast service, fresh fish as well as great portion sizes. My husband really loved the mixed tempura and the gyoza sauce. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As far as price and selection go, this is a very good option on this side of town.  The happy hour deals are very good.  Sadly I was not able to visit during happy hour, but I'm still glad I made it in, even at full price.   I had two rolls: the Dunlap Roll (a spicy tuna roll topped with white tuna, mustard sauce, green onion and tobiko) and the Couple Roll (spicy crab roll topped with salmon and tuna).  I thought the Dunlap Roll was just OK.  For all of the toppings it came with, it lacked the punch of flavor I expected.  The Couple Roll was very good.  Everything tasted fresh and looked appealing.  They also provided free edamame, which is the best kind.  I only saw one guy working there, so cannot confirm if there are actual Sushi Brothers."}
{"text":"They had such an amazing menu. I went back a few more times after the initial visit. The food was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and tasty specially rolls. This has come to be my favorite place to dine before heading downtown. They have nice wait staff and the sushi chef is very talented can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Inside does not look like outside. Very clean.  Owners very courteous and polite. Food was excellent and fresh. They have been open only since December and could use some more business. It is close to my home and want them to succeed. If you like sushi, at least peek in door to see the inside."}
{"text":"Always great sushi! Good choice of different rolls, and nice quick service. Love this place."}
{"text":"I went back here again recently and I think it's a great spot.  The owner is behind the xounter.  They have many specials and the portions are big.  You can take the rail right to the front door too."}
{"text":"Will take tip off credit card without consent!!! Beware happen to me and once I noticed I said something immediately and the waitress simply told me you didn't tip Last time which is a total lie I always leave cash tips and even if the was the case why would you tip yourself using my card NO EXCUSE!!!!"}
{"text":"The prices are great! They offer lots of specials like free  Edamame or $4 sake bombs. The mermaid susi roll was awesome. As was the night train roll.  The deep fried rolls were just that, deep fried. Im used to a tempura coated fried roll, so these were a bit too greasy for us, not a fan.  Highly recommend the crazy avocado appetizer!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place some love. Being away from the west coast, sushi in the valley is sub par. Although this place may not completely compare, I found a spot that has decent sushi at a great price. I felt at home here and came back many times."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here last night (2/12/17) and I want to say this is not only good food, but the prices are kind of unbeatable. I love to order their Shrimp Tempura, Vegas roll and spicy thing...all of them are so tasty and they even have happy hour which makes your meal even more inexpensive. I would recommend you give it a try. The outside of the restaurant looks a little shady, but once you get inside you will not regret your decision. I have come to realize that the little holes in the wall are sometimes a gem in disguise and that is what I would say about Sushi Bros."}
{"text":"Late lunch with my love. Came due to the great reviews. Reviews didn't do it justice. Food was excellent, service fantastic, and very affordable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I used to live in Okinowia, Japan and the teriyaki chicken was to die for. The sushi was perfect and made to order. I got the red dragon roll. The prices were good too. Oh and I had their sake bomb with Sapporo beer. I was impressed and I like to think of myself as a real sushi snob."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in Phoenix, I make time to stop by whenever I'm in town.  My favorite is the salmon roll, most places skimp on the fish but here it's a good amount and always delicious. They also have teriyaki chicken bowls and other dishes if you have people with you who aren't in the mood for sushi. Highly recommend this place, love it :)"}
{"text":"Little spot with authentic sushi made proudly by a master. Large pieces silky texture grade A fish I'm sure. Nothing like it in San Diego. We will be back. Incredible happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have been going to a lot of various sushi places in the area and this one was close to home and I found that it has some of the best prices and best happy hour. The workers are friendly and service Is always great. Big selection too. It's become my regular place to go."}
{"text":"My friend and I love coming here for happy hour! This is where we get our sushi fix for sure! You get quality sushi for an affordable price. Sake is super cheap and authentic..it gets the job done lol  The area isn't the greatest but don't let Thay fool you and make you miss out on a good time with good food.  The space is small but intimate! This place is a Must try!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix! Great happy hour prices and the owners (chef and waitress) are awesome."}
{"text":"I like this place. Usually a sushi place in this area isn't really good but this place is different. The only problem I have is that I think they close earlier than I would like because I work and go to school and sometimes would like to have sushi but overall a great place for the location."}
{"text":"I had a great experience yesterday at Sushi Bros! There was an avocado dish that was AMAZING! The  rolls were something that I'd drive for  definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"So incredible! Great prices, great edamame, quick service too! Very small and quaint restaurant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time today. Simply put, the food was fresh and delicious, especially for being so reasonably priced. I highly recommend the spicy scallop hand roll and the yellow tail. Also- the employees were very kind and attentive. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! My friend and I came for a spare of the moment lunch! It looks a little sketchy from the outside but the sushi was super cheap and delicious!! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We go to Sushi Bros easily 2-5 times a month. We love this place, great environment, wonderful staff and amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"The tuna is fresh, the sushiya is a pro, and the prices are excellent!  This is a hidden gem in the middle of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. The Tuna Sashimi was thick and fresh!  The shrimp tempura was also awesome. Smith knows what he is doing!  Prices are great too. I will definately be back!  5 Stars"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like it would have good sushi on the outside, but when you step inside, it's a really good place. They have really good happy hour deals and the sushi is terrific. Delicious sushi for a great price! 5/5 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The only reason I know about this place is because i searched sushi bar near me. I'm from Ohio, in on business, so no one recommended this to me. Thanks, Yelp people, cause holy shit this place was great.   The front of the building is nothing to look at. In fact, my coworkers were skeptical about going in and eating sushi, but they're pretty bougie. Me, I know the least conspicuous places are usually some of the best, and this place is no exception.   The decor is amazing, full of character. You can tell the sushi bar is well loved. The food was fantastic. The service was personal. I was chatting with my coworker about what I wanted to get (we were sitting at the sushi bar) and the chef made it upon hearing me. He was nice, humble, and attentive.   The Cherry Blossom, in a yelp recommendation, was phenom, so thanks, internet stranger.  The Sweet Thing was great. I've never had such a large, deep fried roll that didn't fall apart immediately. And he flavor. Wow.   The house sake served hot is well worth the $2.50.   If this place was back home, I'd go as often as possible. Amazing."}
{"text":"Eating through the menu. This week we enjoyed the Monkey Brains, tempura battered mushrooms and spicy imitation crab meat. It was delicious, beautifully served with a salad with a sweet and savory dressing.  The chicken katsu was also expertly prepared. The chicken cutlet was lightly breaded and fried to perfection. It came with steamed rice and a soy vinaigrette.  The miso soup is a steal for $1 with finely diced tofu and scallions.   On Thursday, we were treated to amazing yellowfin hamachi belly. The maguro wasn't bad either. Affordable fresh sashimi works for me every time.  We also live the egg rolls. They use thin rice paper and the filling is unusual and flavorful. Three egg rolls are fried and served with a sweet chili sauce.  Chefs An and Ki and the Kims are the epitome of hospitality. They are always warm and welcoming. The clientele are friendly and social, always offering their recommendations. We are proud to be regulars."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in town, esp for us college students. Working at a sushi restaurant I know when owners overprice their item to make more profit but with sushi bro you will never get that feeling. Today I went with a friend and we ordered a sushi combo which came with a full size spicy tuna or california and a 7 pc sushi for only 13.99 come on what a great deal. Not only that but we ordered a chicken teriyaki bento which only costed 6.99 and you get a full serving of rice, chicken, small side salad, 4pc roll( Cali or spicy),edamame ANNNND a 3 pc mix tempura.. For 7 bucks!!!! You seriously cant go wrong with this place. Outside looks a bit sketchy but besides that LOVE THIS PLACE! Wish I had taken pictures but the food looked so great that I went straight into it haha. 10/10 plus the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Sushi Bros is delicious! We came here for a family dinner and everyone got something different to share. Everything we got tasted amazing. Great food and great service. I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for sushi or Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Great service! The server was so nice. She gave edamame for free. The rolls were a really good and for a really good price. Even tho they were on the cheaper side they didn't skimp on the size, portion, or quality. We got the Las Vegas roll, Sweet Thing, Shrimp Tempura Dream, and a soda! All for $20! I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the full 5 star rating they had. And wow did they deserve all 5 stars! First off they used fresh avocado. Like the freshest avocado. Not a speck of browness and yet very soft. And the sushi chef knew how to cut the avocado evenly. Creating nice pretty slices on top of my roll. Secondly, they got my order of tempura wrong and after I brought it up they without hesitation gave me another order of the correct tempura! Very nice people making very nice sushi. Was very pleasantly surprised that they fully deserved the ratings they got!"}
{"text":"Omg! Amazing food, clean and friendly staff, super affordable as well, hidden hole in the wall, so worth visiting! I live so far but definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place. Happy hour on a Saturday 8pm  for a total $25: 3 rolls and 2sake bombs (4$a pop) . Very customer oriented. Individuals who work here very attentive. Clean. Don't let the outside fool you. went on a Saturday night almost didn't believe it was open all the windows are well covered which once inside gives it a nice ambiance inside. Not only will I go again but recommend others. I love supporting these local business"}
{"text":"We are tough critics when it comes to sushi; we can't help it, we lived in a fishing village in Japan for 2 years. The fish was really good quality and sauces were delicious. Crazy avocado was interesting, in a good way. The rice in the rolls was okay but didnt quite have the authentic sushi rice flavor. Great quality sushi for Phoenix. Excellent service & good prices! Very clean."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall sushi spot that is well worth the drive and money! Good service! Decent sized happy hour menu but the prices are unbeatable! You can get $4 Sapporo Sake Bombs! Sushi comes out right away and it is all so fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a decent little place.  Friendly staff and nice atmosphere.  They had a lot of choices for rolls, and your basics for sashimi.  They also have early and late happy hour specials.  Not much parking though, unless you're willing to walk a bit.  But I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. We ordered our food for pick-up. It was rainbow roll which was dry, and the teriyaki chicken which tasted funny and the rice was dry.   The inside looked really cute with nice ambiance. Maybe one day if a friend talks me into it I would try it again inside the restaurant.   Just outside their door it smelled like urine on the sidewalk. Not their fault; it's just something to watch out for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! When we first walked in there was no one in the place which made us a little nervous but the 5 star reviews on Yelp forced us to per severe. We sat at the bar and looked at the menu. We quickly decided on the Las Vegas roll and spider roll and ordered. The food came out quickly and man was it awesome!!!! The food was super good and the there was about 6 pieces per roll. We asked for the bill thinking we probably were approaching 20-25$ with the two specialty rolls and the edamame we got as an appetizer. When we got the bill we were shocked to see it be less than $15!!!! I double checked it to make sure they weren't missing something and realized that we got 10% off for dining in and the edamame was free!! This place is awesome!! The food was great and the price was unbeatable. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So glad I believed the Yelp reviews and gave this place a shot! Don't be put off by the strip mall location--the food and ambiance inside is wonderful. The owner/sushi chef is friendly and the rolls are fresh and delicious. The happy hour menu is pretty extensive and incredibly affordable. We had 4 rolls and a sake bomber set up for $20. Will definitely be coming here in the future when we are craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Very good food and reasonable prices. They have great specials too. Definitely worth giving them a try. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Small space but definitely homeisssh feeling. Prices are reasonable and they have quite a variety. Their fish was super fresh. I had salmon and tuna and both were extremely tasty and fresh. Customer service was at point."}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly staff. Food was just what I needed. Big cuts of fish and well prepared. No complaints. Very happy and full"}
{"text":"We eat sushi semi regularly around town and have for years.  We had been to Sushi Q one time and we live close, so that should tell you something about what we thought.  We are SO GLAD we tried the new place!  Everything was awesome - food, owners, cleanliness. When the owners found out that my 12 year old some really likes fish, they made him this plate on the house.  It was so nice.  See photo.  It doesn't get better than this for American style sushi.  We are headed back tonight."}
{"text":"I did lunch here today under the suggestion of my sister. At first I was skeptical because it's a tiny little hole in the wall place, nothing outstanding on the outside.  We sat down and ordered water to drink. They have fantastic water. That sounds weird but water can be kind of hit or miss at restaurants... Then we all ordered a few rolls. What I loved about this place is for a few bucks a roll you get huge slabs of fish and not a ton of rice like most places. It's a great bang for your buck and the service was good.  Looking for budget sushi that leaves you satisfied and not bloated? This is it."}
{"text":"I was schooled on not referring to this strip mall sushi spot as Sushi Brothers but as Sushi Bros. Like \"Hey Bro, how's it goin'?\" And it does have that kind of frat house vibe about it, especially since their big tag line in the front window is \"Happy Hour Every Day\". I would have been more impressed if it said \"Happy Hour Every Hour\". We parked between two Ford trucks, one with a gun rack and the other with a Trump for President bumper sticker, so we fully expected a lot of testosterone on the premises during the lunch hour. But no, I guess real men don't eat sushi. In fact, surprisingly no one eats sushi since the place was empty.  My colleague counts this as his favorite sushi spot since it's pretty close by the business park where our office is. The rolls have all sorts of provocative names like the Playgirl and the Climax which has some kind of mystery sauce. I bypassed those in favor of the $13.99 Chirashi, which was completely a chef's choice of fresh sashimi on top of rice. I came on a good day because the lacquer box was chock full of slices of tuna, salmon, prawns, and sea bream (photo: http://bit.ly/2BtcC9L) and quite a generous side of white rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2Fg7KXz). It was a good option in an unlikely location.  FOOD - 3 stars...generous box of chirashi AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...strip mall fancy, nothing special SERVICE - 3 stars...nothing that stands out or sears in my memory TOTAL - 3 stars...a little bang for your buck in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great prices, solid rolls, friendly service!  Sampled above average menu items such as teriyaki chicken (grilled, no less),  good ole chicken katsu, and miso soup.  Looking forward to investigating the menu further. Happy hour prices make me happy (think sake  bombs)...."}
{"text":"This place is such a find. The crunchy spicy tuna roll is the best I've ever had.  Don't let the exterior discourage you.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Overall an excellent experience for a local sushi restaurant. They work hard and provide good quality sushi, had a tuna hand roll, sweet shrimp and a yellow tail roll, all very tasty.  They staff was very friendly and eager to provide a very enjoyable customer experience. To top things off the price is very reasonable. I'd defiantly return if I'm staying locally, also recommend giving it a try if you're near."}
{"text":"Wanted something light so we decided some sushi sounded good. Found Sushi Bros on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Despite tbe fact the location wasnt typically our first thought for where great sushi is \"born\"   They have happy hour 7pm to close on Sat night. The prices are unbelievable. 5.50 for a Vegas roll? 5 bucks for a spicy tuna roll? AND THEY PLAY 80'S MUSIC!! LOL.  Another thing I am a complete germaphobe. To the point where thinking about how many hands have touched the menu I am holding freaks me out if I pause too long on the thought. But this place is immaculate. The menus are spotless. Everything is taken care of exceptionally well and very very clean.  But that's just the beginning because what good are low prices and great throw back music if the food sucks? Not the case here. The food was great. The sushi chef obviously knows his stuff. He's great AND he's fast. Skills, serious skills.  The one thing that baffles me was this place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. I know the restaurant was a bit difficult to find and it was off to the side of a strip mall and the windows are covered (privacy or safety?) So it's a bit dark making it a little hard to find. The inside though was fun with intetesting things to look at and talk about so I had to add my honest opinion of the restaurant and the food because its truly a shame if this place is always so under appreciated.   Give Sushi Bros a try and you'll see it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Take out Fri evening..delish, something crunchy (sweetpotato) over salmon Chefs choice plate, tuna,eel,etc better than being in restaurant cuz we could watch Bill Mahr & Vice !"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a sketchy strip mall. The food was delicious and inexpensive, and the service was fast and attentive. The happy hour menu has a lot of items on it. With curiosity overriding trepidation, I ordered the happy hour \"Monkey Brains.\" I figured that, priced at less than $5, they weren't real monkey brains. Winner! They were imitation crab stuffed mushrooms, deep fried and drizzled with spicy sauce. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great, super friendly staff, and prices very reasonable. Not the greatest neighborhood but the the food, service and prices easily make up for it. The whole family loves this place, and I've had many nice biz lunched there."}
{"text":"The reviews didn't mention it was in the hood and next to a liquor store. However I took my boys there before the sun went down. The sushi was very good, the chef was engaging and the service was very good. The restaurant offers no frills but the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Every Saturday we come here. And here's why:)  The flavor is consistent and the price is awesome. For less then 20 bucks you get a bento and 2 sushi rolls. (That's our go to)  We used to live nearby but now have to drive 30 minutes to get here, but that does not stop us from getting our sushi here!!  We tried most of the cooked sushi but here's our faves: 1. Vegas 2. Shrimp Tempura 3. Calamari 4. Golden California 5. California dream   The bento is also very appealing to the budget, here's what we've tried and recommends; 1. Chicken bento (almost 90 percent of the time) 2. Salmon bento 3. Beef.  This place was the first place that made my gf eat sushi. So if you think someone needs to try some good sushi- drop some love here.  Disclosure: I tried a lot of sushi places and for us to keep coming back here weekly - speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I know chef An way back then. He was really artistic and honest chef. When I found out that he opened his own restaurant, I couldn't be happier. Food was really good and well prepared. This restaurant is new kid on the block and definitely this is must try place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is friendly from the chef to the waitresses and happy hour is all day! It's become one of my \"girl time\" spots   And we always feels welcomed!"}
{"text":"Clean, simple, good atmosphere, good textures, good tastes, good prices. This place does not feel rushed or presumptuous -which I like!"}
{"text":"Food was definitely delicious. It's a great place to meet people and it does get busy which means slower service."}
{"text":"This place is great. The sushi was delicious and the people were so nice! The happy hour runs like all day and had a lot of selections. Everything came out quick and was so good. We had the edamame and gyoza. Will be back for the gyoza alone!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Everything tastes great for a great price!  Clean, fast service, & friendly grateful staff.  I can't wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"I started visiting this place when it was known as \"Sushi Q,\" and had not been here in a while. Not much has changed, decor-wise, in the interior, but I have noticed a change in the food offerings. (The miso soup seems to have a different flavor that most varieties I've tried, but I'm willing to give it a chance.)  What really impressed me was the rolls I've tried, and of course, the sashimi. I swear, the fish portions are more generous than I remember. (Reminding me somewhat of a place I went to in Fremont, CA ages ago.)  Overall, I was satisfied with my meal, and the price, and I'd be likely to return whenever I can. I'll be keeping an eye on this place, and seeing how the next evolution goes \"with the bros.\" ^_^"}
{"text":"Super good and friendly staff. Food was fresh, tasty, and quick service. Night train roll was definitely a repeat. First time and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding taste, Fresh sushi with a big selection! Staff very friendly!! I will be back soon thank you."}
{"text":"Great sushi, Great service!  All around fabulous place.  My \"go to\" for fun, tasty last minute dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have never had a bad experience, a bad suggestion, or a bad piece of sushi.  The staff is great, food is amazing, and the sushi chef is awesome.  If you like sushi that is affordable, beautiful, and delicious - this is the place for you.  Oh and 2 words: Crazy Avocado  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! We came here for the first time and will definitely be back SOON. They have amazing happy hour pricing and a big variety of rolls to choose from. It is small and cute, the workers are very polite and friendly. I give a 5 star for service, pricing and of course the food."}
{"text":"It's decent, not great.  The roll variety was kind of minimal and everyone commented that they all sound the same.  They were all very similar.  Service was good.  Price was very low, so that helps balance out the value.  We found one of the tuna sashimis rather bland, thought it's usually full of flavor.  Don't know why.  They do have fresh wasabi, which certainly helps."}
{"text":"Been looking for a new sushi place near our new office. After reading the positive reviews,  I made the visit. I've been to many locations to eat sushi in the valley and this has to be the place the serves the thickets sashimi slices. I was pleasantly full after having their sushi combo #3. Fish is nice and fresh, firm and delicious. I think I have found my new spot near work"}
{"text":"Wonderful little sushi place right next to home!  Don't walk by without checking it out!  Everything we've had has been fantastic (my favorite is Sweet Thing)!!  The only downside is that they don't have as extensive of a cocktail menu as I would like.  Other sushi places I've been to have 4 or more varieties of drinks, while this place only has a couple."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi spot in town, if not in state. Sushi chef An does masterful work with his dishes. I'm a big salmon connoisseur, so my review is primarily based on dishes containing salmon. I've tried most all variations containing salmon and none has ever disappointed. Their sashimi dishes are spectacular, especially so for the Salmon Avocado sashimi dish (masterfully presented as well). Their Salmon Nigiri also does not disappoint. Simple yet very tasteful. Sushi Bros offers a wide variety of sushi rolls, including some of the more popular rolls. A happy hour that covers all but two and half hours of their business day, as well as great pricing to match 20 of their happy hour choices. Their complimentary edamame is also done right with the perfect amount of salt. Their egg-rolls, which are not oversized like in most places, make a great addition to your meal as well. Friendly and courteous staff, you're bound to enjoy your time at Sushi Bros. I recommend this place to any and all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, not best part of town. Unbelievable prices and quality sushi! Each roll seems to have its own unique tastes and are packed with flavor. I haven't found quality sushi for this cheap in the valley yet."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great!   Don't let name or location turn you off.  The sashimi was fresh and wonderful.  Authentic.  Of course I was hesitant to come in since but Phoenix strip mall locations can hide jewels.   I will be back and make this my prime sushi in north Phoenix when I am visiting.    It's not glamorous. But good sushi does not have to  be."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised! We read the reviews and gave it chance. The food was great, sushi fresh, and the happy hour menu was fantastic. Service was great and made sure we were happy with the food and experience."}
{"text":"You cook very wonderful! I love of kind eat! They nice and friendly to we made happy. In room very nice. I like less money very good save our life. We loved this place! Definitely a diamond in the rough! We will be going back.. Don't be scared of neighborhood.. Its a great place on the inside. Free edemama!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place to come to in Phoenix! Always great service and amazing tasting sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place! It looks a little sketchy on the outside but once you step in the doors it's all good! The sushi is amazing and the prices are low :) I go here multiple times a week and have never had any issues. Highly recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the disconnect is for this place vs all the reviews I've read.  Boyfriend and I walked in at around 8:40pm and sat down. We immediately got water and a soda, and then were completely ignored/forgotten about for close to a half hour.  Waitress walked by many many times, but didn't give us the time of day. I finally flagged down the other waitress and we put in our order.  Then, while we were still eating, first waitress gave us our bill and informed us that they closed at 9:30 so we would have to pay and leave quickly...I had to bite my tongue to not snap back at her \"well, we would be done if you hadn't made us sit here for a half hour!\".  Not going back. Oh, and the sushi was just okay, nothing to write home about.  Disappointing date night :("}
{"text":"Never a big fan of sushi although I have tried it in various restaurants  & cities.  Only came to Sushi Bros. because my daughter recommended it  so highly and I enjoy her company.   I love the food we get here!  I think my favorite must be \"Crazy Avocado\" which resembles a salad and must have at least one entire  avocado on it, maybe more.  The dressing is a bit spicy but good.  The hot saki is delicious any time but especially now on chilly, wet evenings.  \"Sweet Things\" is excellent and even their vegetable tempura is excellent and not greasy.  We just tried \"Monkey Brains\" last week, after carefully confirming it's not real brains but fried mushrooms with the same spicy dressing or sauce as Crazy Avocados.  We also enjoy Green Lipped Mussels although they do take about 20 minutes  after being ordered.  My daughter is wild about the various kinds  of fried ice cream but they give you a huge amount of whipped cream with it but only toothpicks so a lot of the cream goes to waste. Don't be put off by their location.  It is next to a drive through liquor store and the strip mall itself seems to attract some dodgy looking people.  The food is worth it and the service is both friendly and efficient.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great quality for a cheap price! Don't let the sketchy exterior steer you away, the interior is beautiful with excellent customer service & delicious food!"}
{"text":"For the past 4 years I would order takeout from this location when I wanted a quick sushi fix. The place was \"Sushi Q\" back then and I never had a complaint because I knew what to expect. They had inexpensive, better than grocery store quality sushi. Now it has been taken over by new owners and I seriously could not be happier!! They have amazing sushi and great prices. I ordered my usual tootsie roll, spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll. They did not disappoint! WAY better quality and no filler in my spicy tuna! Thanks Sushi Bros for sprucing up my local sushi joint! You have a customer for life."}
{"text":"This review was colmpleted friday but posted today After 5 check ins, and 2 other times that i forgot to check in, and many posted pictures later , is time i post review!   By far every experience has been great, the staff never fails to be friendly, and attentive. Now lat me tell you why service is amazing here... First and foremost there's about 3 big tables that can sit six people , 3 that sit four and about 4 that sit 2 now this changes as party grows because the tables are placed together.. Now every single time I been there (except for yesterday) there had only one person attending to many tables at once and delivering such a great service. Now yesterday there was one more person and they both did an amazing job since the place was pretty packed. They continued to give great service, despite the obvious pressure  The food.. I'm not the one that had tried many sushi places... But how could I? when I already fell in love.. I'll feel as I'm cheating if I do!! The food has been great, 7 visits later and the quality remains the same, flavor and texture both perfectly align every time!   For starters they offer a COMPLIMENTARY edamame (which I never ordered)  or gyoza (4 pieces for party of 2 and more pieces for bigger parties). Now they offer happy hour from 11 am to 4pm and from 7pm to 11 pm  Mon- Sat. They have a variety of rolls included and the quality remains the same because out of my 7 times here I have been here twice on a Sunday (_no happy hour special).Now the hiight of day ... The sake bombs for $4 during happy hour. Ive ordered only the sake with a Sapporo beer and I always ask for a second cup and Shae with a friend or my bf , whoever goes    I've basically ordered everything that's deep fried already, and by far my favorite was the sweet thing and viva las Vegas! I always get both ! Soooo good !!! I just went last night and feel going again tonight.. I have problems !  Bathrooms, soooo clean everytime and never fail to disappoint.   I love sushi here"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice small sushi house, good customer service, outstanding sushi platter presentation on the sushi..awesome happy hour! Lunch specials as well, Id come bak fo sho. Definately tastey food."}
{"text":"I found this great little jem on Yelp, so glad I did. The sushi was amazing and super fresh."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 20 years. I eat here 3 to 5 times a week, it's awesome An the sushi chef and owner is amazing. Don't let the location fool you this is the best sushi in Phoenix for a great price. Truly I cannot say enough about this place."}
{"text":"Happy hour Monday-Saturday all day! $4 sake bombs.  On a Saturday night we had 3 rolls and 2 sakes for $25.   The second time we went we did not get rolls in happy hour and they were $10.99, which being a specialty roll is not bad.   Out of the rolls I've had my favorite is Sweet Thing.   Definitely recommend this place. It looks a little sketchy from from the outside, but truly worth checking it out."}
{"text":"sushi bros is the best, wish it was closer to me but it's worth the 15 minute drive! sashimi here is the freshest I've found in AZ :)"}
{"text":"Ok I have to say once again exceptional! Spot on with service, the ambience and mostly, the food. I have my favorites but every time we go we try something different."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. The staff is friendly. The sushi was good and affordable. They serve nothing but sushi here."}
{"text":"Great prices.  Excellent Happy Hour, free appetizer + 10% off for dining in.  Place is really small.  They only have one sushi chef so bring a dose of patience. However the service is top-notch and they make sure you get appetizers and drinks promptly while you wait.  The last time we went there was a hair in my husband's tempura - the reason for my 4 star review - but they were really great about it and removed the item from our bill. Hopefully they will be more vigilant about their food handling practices.   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This my favorite sushi spot. Me and my GF  frequent weekly and we like it so much we'll do takeout for nights we don't feel like going out. The sushi quality is superb!"}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall type of restaurants. Gave this place a go because of their awesome reviews.   Their happy hour menu had a good amount of sushi on it and the prices were amazing! $4 Sapporo sake bomb? Who wouldn't love that! Probably the cheapest sake bomb special I've ever seen. Complimentary edamame and 10% off your total bill just for dining in (it also applies to the happy hour items)   I ordered their philly roll, shrimp tempura and sweet thing! The fish didn't taste cheap and had a fresh taste to it! The server was super pleasant and our food came out in a timely manner! Cups were always refilled and most importantly the food tasted great!   I will def be back!"}
{"text":"When this place was Sushi Q it was a disaster. Since it has been purchased and rebranded I love it. The happy hour prices are perfect. The fish may be the freshest I have eaten since I was in San Francisco. They make the big rolls not the small rolls with lots of rice but no fish. This is clearly an organization that wants their customer to be happy and satisfied with very good prices. I even had a very nice conversation at the sushi bar.  2 Salmon Nigiri (perfectly sized) 1 Salmon Roll 1 Tuna Roll 1 Fried Cali Roll 1 Salmon Tempura Roll 1 Ice Tea $27 including tax"}
{"text":"I went here based on previous Yelp reviews, and I guess my expectations were too high (or I didn't order the right rolls). The lollipop roll was decent, the Alaska roll is AMAZING. I should mention we ordered the sushi as takeout (I know, blasphemous) so I can't review the decor or service. You should definitely try it out of you are in the area."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover! We were pleasantly surprised. Even though the outside looks run down the sushi is amazing and so are the prices! 7.99 for two rolls is the lunch special with a large selection of rolls. Also free edamame for the table during lunch time happy hour. Everyone enjoyed their food and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Looks sketchy from the outside, but it's nice on the inside. The sashimi tasted great, our waitress was very tentative and the atmosphere was nice. This is definitey my favorite sushi bar."}
{"text":"I tried here for the first time today after reading great reviews about Sushi Bros. I am picky with sushi and I thought it would be worth trying here. The sushi chef was awesome and I left the restaurant filling good and full. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants good sushi with good prices."}
{"text":"Cute little sport we found by searching \"yelp near by\"...I have said I love all things Asian so of course we stopped! We got 4 rolls and were completely stuffed!! 5 stars they didn't have any veggie options on the menu but when I told her how I liked it she said \"sure no problem!\" Uuuummmmmm yes please....now if only they had a bucket full of hundreds!"}
{"text":"Go here if you're looking for a small, quick sushi bar/restaurant. The sushi bar sits about 10, and there are about 8 tables in the place total. Small staff - just the sushi chef and one waitress, who was so sweet and attentive. I live nearby and had been meaning to try this place for a while. I was pleasantly surprised that there was complimentary edamame - and great happy hour sushi roll and drinks specials (open until 4:30 PM, and from 7 PM to close). They do have some special rolls and noodle bowl entrees, but I just got the rainbow roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Both tasted really fresh - and were great. I also had the edamame, the pork gyoza and a glass of Cabernet. Overall it was all fast and fresh and good - I will definitely be back...especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and we both loved it!  The food was really good and the dining area was very authentic and beautiful. The have happy hour from open to 4 and 7 to close.  With 4$ sake bombs and half of rolls.  We will go back soon!  Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Food was good, place was quite and small. Everything was fresh and prepared quickly. They do serve gluten free soy sauce, which is a big plus for me. The happy hour goes all day, which to me seems silly. Why not just lower the menu items on the list? One down side is that most of the rolls are spin offs of the California roll, or have a tempura element. Being gluten free, that limits my options and lends little to creativity. The veggie roll was pretty good, and we had the tuna lovers roll, which is really quite tasty. I was told a long time ago by a friend that the best way to judge a sushi restaurant was by the tomago. This place, it was just ok. The texture was almost brittle with a bit of a spongy texture. The flavor was alright, but the mouth feel was off. My son, loved the place, though it has been a while since we have gone for sushi, so he may have just missed the experience. I will definitely go back, I'll give the tomago another try."}
{"text":"Good place with fresh fish and yummy rolls! And I'm also shocked at the great prices for the quality of rolls. Normal ridiculous places charge double and their rolls are mediocre. The staff is incredibly nice as well."}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin...came in today around 5ish it was empty...based on the reviews decided to try it. The bathroom was spotless!! Very clean and tidy. I ordered a sake bomb and three rolls. Ordered the sweet thing, las vegas, and dunlap roll. These rolls have been one of the very best I have had in Phx!! The rolls were very well made and heavy...which means well packed as well! Delicious everything was delicious!! Will def be coming back to this place!! I recommend for everyone to try the sushi here. Amazing quality and service!! Service was very quick and waitress was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. Best prices, amazing service. This is our go-to for all our sushi cravings! Owner/Chef An and his staff are so nice. Love Sushi Bros!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way back to our town. First let me say where we live is small and the sushi is not great, so I was dying for some great sushi like I've always had in Tucson *(sushi ten)*. I saw it had great reviews, and a happy hour, so I was game.  First it's in the weirdest place ever. Off the side of a strip mall with like NO parking, but as any wannabe foodie know... Don't judge the book by the cover.  We went in and it was pretty empty, it's small, but it's everything I love in a sushi place. They catered to my kids and got us edamame and miso soup. My husband and I ordered 4 rolls. We had the spicy tuna, Las Vegas, crunchy California, and I think it was called sweet something roll. They were decently quick (again empty though) and the food was delicious! It was perfectly flavored and wrapped.  Plus it is happy hour all day until 6 I think, and if you dine in you get an EXTRA 10% off! We paid $22 for drinks, 4 rolls, and the miso soup.  I call this a WIN! And will be back again when we are in Phoenix again! -- plus it's close to the 17 so that's awesome too."}
{"text":"Great prices, great sushi, GREAT SAKE BOMBERS ($4.50 a pop...can NOT beat that). The outside looks highly shady but the inside is nice and the staff is friendly. Definitely a new staple location. My husband and I got  6 rolls and 2 sake bombers each and our bill was less than $50. Seriously....cant beat it."}
{"text":"Sushi Bros is one of the best sushi joints in this area. The waitstaff is friendly and the food is ready quickly. Their happy hour is a great value! It's in a sketchy area but don't let that deter if you find yourself off 19th avenue and Dunlap with a rumbly tummy."}
{"text":"Every time I get sushi in phx I've gotten food poisoning. I decided to give sushi one last try and was so glade I did! Sushi bros  was amazing! And had great prices for their happy hour! They sushi chef was so sweet and even gave my fiancé a free drink for his 21st. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First, let me say this place is incredibly inexpensive, yet very good.  The sushi is not the absolute best in the area, but it's very, very good.   You can EASILY spend twice as much at wild tuna, and find the equality marginally different.  The three of us went to wild tuna on Tuesday and received a bill for $160.  Here it was $62 for similar orders."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden local treasure. Everyone there is super nice and ALL of the food we have tried has been delicious!!"}
{"text":"By far an excellent find, a hidden gem in this area. The sushi is delicious and is reasonably priced. Don't let the outside appearance fool you because it's very nice on the inside and the service is good too. I will be eating here every time a travel to Phoenix for work"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood sushi restaurant. The sushi is good, affordable, and the people who work there are very kind. You can tell the sushi chef works hard and is dedicated to his business."}
{"text":"AN, the sushi chef can roll with the best. Happy hour everyday and 2 will fill you up. This was my first visit and will not be my last. The restaurant was clean and quiet very relaxing on a lunch break!"}
{"text":"This place looks a little sketchy on the outside, but if you go in, you won't be disappointed. The sushi was delicious. We had the Climax roll and the Alaska roll and the 5 piece sushi combo with spicy tuna roll. Everything was delicious and the server was prompt and curteous. Definitely recommend this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow. I had a hard time believing so many 5 Star reviews could belong to this hole in the wall gem. Boy, was I wrong! My only surprise is that this place is not packed every night. If you are local and eating sushi anywhere else, you are crazy. Yes, they are not AYCE, but just look at the quality and portion size of the sushi in my picture. Unbelievable! With the Happy Hour prices I ate until I was stuffed and still left for just over $30. Service was great, too! Run, don't walk to Sushi Bros!"}
{"text":"First time visit and definitely not my last. I was in the mood for a cucumber wrapped roll. While it wasn't on the menu, the sushi chef was kind enough to grant my lunchtime request. It tasted like heaven, so fresh and crunchy with just the right kick thanks to spicy tuna. Amazing happy hour all day long from 11-4:30 and again from 7 to close. The service is so friendly. I couldn't help but notice almost every customer that left gave a hearty thank you and/or good-bye and it was happily returned. A good sign in my book. For all location snobs: Please don't let the strip mall facade deter you, there is a hidden gem inside Sushi Bros. Give it a try. I know I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Sushi Bros after reading Yelp reviews and also because it's so close to our neighborhood. We sat at the sushi bar and the staff were warm and welcoming. We ordered the Sake bomb with Sapporo and yellowtail and shrimp sushi along with the Arizona roll. Our edamame appetizer came with our drinks and were warm and slightly salty--perfect to start with. Wow, everything was made with care and the yellowtail was lovely and fresh. My husband ordered the salmon teriyaki dinner and the fish had an excellent glaze and was delicious. I ordered the chichen yakisoba and it was exactly how I wanted my noodles! Flavorful and full of chicken and vegetables. The Arizona Roll is a delicious combination of tuna and avocado."}
{"text":"We come here atleaaast 4 times a week. The owners are absolutely amazing. So nice and funny too. 10% off dine in and happy hour specials are to die for. Not literally of course. Lol"}
