{"text":"Spaghetti pie - yes. omg Yep a kid and Crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"I used to hang out at Pizzazz all the time growing up.  I loved their chicken salad.  But that was like 15 years ago.  I recently went back and discovered that yes, the chicken salad is still just as good.  What consistency!  I can't explain to you what is so delicious about this simple chicken salad.  It's just iceberg lettuce with grilled chicken, grape tomatoes, black olives, shredded provolone, and house italian dressing.  All I can surmise is that the secret is in the house dressing.  And the cheese is wonderfully moist, unlike most dry shredded cheese on salads.  I vaguely remember that their pizza is good too, but really, this review is for the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Salad dressing with HAIR, not one but TWO. Waitstaff and management were shockingly cavalier. There are plenty of pizza places that can make dressing without the HAIRS. Never again."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with their newer menu and chef.  I've been in a few times this year already and I along with my bff are pleasantly surprised and happy with their changes that we will continue to support this local restaurant.  The food is actually great.  The wine prices are cheap and their brewed iced tea is always fresh.  They have the best calamari in the city- never overdone.  I Love their raspberry dressing on the arugula pear salad and the Italian wedding soup.  My bff usually orders the mesculin salad with a side of chopped grilled chicken. Mmm...the warm bread is delicious.  Service is friendly and fast and the place is clean.  That's important to us because we eat out a lot.  We've had the calzones and they are large and hearty, usually enough  to take home. The gnochi is fantabulous.  Their flash fried kale is good and different but a little greasy."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and well organized ! However the food was way below average ! Pizza was oily and the crust was tasteless. Honestly I don't understand the high reviews here ! The service was very bad and unacceptable , the waiter was best conversation killer ever ! All we heard from were ( yes / no / ok) he wasn't welcoming at all and not happy serving us , Not coming back there and will not suggest to a friend"}
{"text":"In Cleveland from out of town. Decided to try based on a Yelp review. Was very pleased with the food, the 4 cheese calzone was great."}
{"text":"The first time I experienced Pizzazz on the circle near JCU I was invited to a party in their downstairs 'Jake's Speakeasy'.  it was a great venue for a party - plenty of space, bar seating and tables.  Overall a nice laid back atmosphere... the food was tremendous and the party was a blast.  My girlfriend and I decided to go back for dinner with another couple.  I went with the Stuffed Gnocchi Abruzzi (amazing) and my friend went with a chicken parm.   He loved it ! My girlfriend, being a finicky eater, was thrilled that the menu was not limited to just pizza; she had the Cajun Chicken Salad which was impressively fresh, not to mention Pizzazz's famous Italian salad dressing, which is great.  This has become a regular spot for us, and will continue to be for takeout and dining in."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My husband likes to occasionally stop and get pizza here because of the convenient location between his work and our home, and quite honestly because Pizzazz takes credit cards and Geracis requires cash on hand. The last time we ordered pizzas from Pizzazz, they were both watery: the topping layer would immediately slide off of the dough base leaving you with one big bite of toppings and many bites of boring, soggy dough. We also had fried provolone which smelled and tasted like it had burnt plastic in it and the cheese was dense unless eaten quickly while sizzling hot. I wouldn't let my toddler eat it for fear of choking and not understanding the harsh smell- although my husband and I both tried some and we're fine. I don't understand the hype, except that we Heights people try to support our local family businesses and Pizzazz has been in this area for a long time. They do have a lovely spot on Fairmount circle."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I was growing up in Shaker but I got it after moving back to Ohio from Cali and this place has gone downhill. Food is not cooked or made well. I had the Pesto Pizza and Stuffed Gnnochi and it did not impress or bring back memories why I loved the place growing up. It looked like they have just a bunch of teenagers working there. Don't know if they just don't care about the experience they hire now.."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the cleveland area and we went to this restaurant.  We were sat but a waitress never came so we had to go back to the hostess area and ask for a waitress, turns out the waitress that finally came over was the one who saw us sitting there 15 minutes ago but she said she didnt know we were there, the calamari was horrible and the pizza so so soggy I couldnt pick it up to eat it and there was sitting water under my pizza, then of course I had to go and get my own napkins to sop up the mess because the waitress was so unattentive.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"First thing is First.  The dinner salad.  My friends and I can never resist ordering the dinner salad when we come here (which used to be more often when we went to John Carroll).  Usually by the time you get through the cheese, it is kind of hard to eat the rest because I swear they use half of a block of grated cheese.  I have really never been disappointed here.  Sometimes the service can be a little rude,  but they are usually pretty busy so that is understandable.    Word of advice to anyone that likes Irish Car Bombs but you dont feel like paying $8 at another bar, you can get one here for a mere $5 and they are usually pretty big.  Warning, you may get wrapped up in the fact that the shots are not that expensive, and the next thing you know, huge bar tab.  But then again, the only people who use this as an actual bar opposed to a restaurant is my group of friends."}
{"text":"For pizza in Cleveland, this place is great.  It just doesn't compare to pizza from Chicago or New York, hence the 3 stars.  Great place for the local JCU students to eat because it's right across from campus.  I enjoy their dinner salad as well as a few of their pizzas.  Their meat toppings may not be plentiful but that's why their prices are average.  I've had nothing but good experiences here and will continue to grab pizza here every once and a while."}
{"text":"It's that place! Great food and excellent wings. Very quick on the carry out order pick up times"}
{"text":"First time back here in years. Tomato basil pasta was a little heavy on the oil and could have used more basil for taste, but all in all tasted alright. I added Romano cheese for flavor, wouldn't do a repeat of that order though.  Spinach provolone bread was excellent. The dinner salad, when I found it under a pound of cheese was all iceberg which is basically tasteless. The dressing, I absolutely love their dressing . I will return, but if I were to encounter rude service as some of the other reviews state, it would be a deal breaker. I ordered carry out ."}
{"text":"Great local Italian joint with good pizza, excellent pasta dishes and a great beer selection. Been going here all my life. Always happy to go back."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey for the amount of food you get the food is high quality but it's kind of pricey and it's always crowded too many people in a small space"}
{"text":"I noticed new management a couple of years ago and it has never been the same since.   Very upsetting, I used to love this place. SMH"}
{"text":"We hosted a family celebration at Pizazz this afternoon for a party of 14. We ordered the food in advance, and it was ready shortly after all of our guests arrived. We had 4 large pizzas and lots of salad with the amazing House dressing, plus beverages (including a few beers) and the tab was  only $130. We had boxes of leftover pizza and salad - enough for another meal for 3-4. They let us bring in a large sheet cake, even setting up a table for serving the cake. Our server was very attentive, keeping plates cleared and drinks refilled. Its proximity to John Carroll makes it so convenient for students and their families."}
{"text":"We dine at Pizzazz fairly often. We have had good experiences and bad ones, so I will list some of the pros and cons of Pizzazz.   Pros -   1. The pizza is pretty good.   2. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere.   3. Lots of parking.   4. The salads are great (don't forget their house italian dressing!)   Cons -   1. Service can be hit or miss. We once had a manager, of all people, claim that the mushrooms on our pizza had something called \"wild seasonings\", after we said that the mushrooms on our pizza were not wild mushrooms like we had asked for, and are advertised on the menu.   **Please note, service is especially bad on the bar side of the restaurant! If you don't want to be ignored and forgotten, eat on the dining room side!   2. Pizza sometimes comes out of the kitchen way too hot and the cheese just slides right off when you go to pick it up.   3. Employees in the kitchen are sometimes loud enough for you to hear in the dining room, especially when the owner is not there."}
{"text":"The menu has been expanded a bit. The food its very good and prices are reasonable. The same wait staff has been there for decades, which tells you a great deal about the operation. it's family friendly. The calzones are terrific, pizza is very good and the chicken part is tops."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is, \"the worst popular place in the area.\" The pizza here isn't that great at all. It's actually pretty bad. Yet this place is always popping, mainly because of it's ideal location for the nearby students.  I've been here a few times and I just don't get what all the buzz is about. And I've asked the others in line and they agree, it's not great food. And I'm not even sure why. But I do really wish they'd use more sauce on their pizzas. Even when asking for extra sauce, it's still not enough.  The location is great as I can walk to it. And as I said, it's great for students. Their prices are a bit high for pizza, especially what you get. I'm not sure id recommend this honestly. My family agrees, so does the other customers; try elsewhere !"}
{"text":"I've lived close to this place for years, but never ate here as I figured it was a cheap college hangout with cheap, runny sauce. Wow, I was wrong! I got the pepperoni/meatball pizza - it was amazing!! Thin crust, but not too thin. Crispy bottom. Perfection."}
{"text":"The house salad dressing was awesome. The pizza came out and looked AMAZING. I remember thinking, wow this is gonna be delicious. It had no flavor. I sprinkled Parmesan and red pepper flakes to give it some flavor. Maybe they forgot to add seasoning? Not sure. Looked good though!"}
{"text":"I do service work for pizzazz and the people who own it are very very nice. They have the best pizza around. Ive been to Italy and had great pizza there but i prefer pizzazz. Their salads are excellent too and the dressing is a work of culinary art! I highly recommend visiting this place if you love pizza."}
{"text":"The calzones are to die for, and their pizzaz salad has as much meat as green. As a pizza fanatic I am impressed with their restaurant and especially with their pepperoni pizzas"}
{"text":"It's neighborhood hangout. Food is average.. I have a couple favorites.  Calzones often doughy. Salads a very fresh and crisp. Guacamole gross and over spicy. The saddest part is most of their wait staff don't smile. There are a couple that work weekdays that are fun and friendly. The hostess seating me didn't even smile today. Many have been there for years and seem unhappy. Today I basically had one totally ignore me. I knew I'd be there for awhile working between events in town and would have tipped over 20% for being there. If your not buying alcohol I guess your not worth the time. I even told her I wanted to order a pizza To go for a 4:00 event. She said they take 1/2 hour. She basically never spoke or acknowledged me again. Even went to bar to get my bill and she didn't respond after 3 attempts and standing by my table with my coat on. I should have walked out without paying."}
{"text":"Asked waiter if they had meat balls , he then smirked and proceeded to say \"You can meet these balls\" . Very rude and disrespectful service will not come here again . Still didn't get my meatballs . Restaurant does not deliver ."}
{"text":"Pizzazz  This is a place that I believe to be a bit overrated, however the close spatial proximity to JCU makes it an obvious option for students.  I always just had the thin crust pizza when I went here.  One time my roommate ordered a salad that said it came with some meat topping.  This salad came out with three of the smallest pepperoni slices that I have ever seen.  We were all laughing.  Another time I saw my psychology professor repeating, verbatim, our lecture to try to impress some middle age woman.  Something like, \"Your smell is driving my limbic system wild.\"  Again I was laughing my ass off."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre Italian food. I thought the Alfredo pasta was pretty bland. The calzones are huge though and taste pretty good. I guess the highlights of this place are that the food is relatively inexpensive and the service is great. But don't come here expecting outstanding Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is an old family favorite.  Every so often we have a dinner gathering here.  The food is awesome.    I love the open kitchen.  The bar side is a great place to sit with friends and enjoy the game while the dining room side is a nice place for family dinning. I attended a friends work party in the basement party center/bar which was really nice too.   Go for the Cajun chicken salsa pasta.  Switch the pasta to cavatelli.  The pizzas and salads are great too!"}
{"text":"What are you doing right now. Are you on YELP looking for somewhere great for dinner? BINGO!!! You found it.   Now that I'm done with my cheezy opening, lets get down to it. This place is awesome. You can't go wrong with anything off the menu. First thought would be to get something that someone on here has raved over or a fan favorite. But...please look at the specials. They always have something that usually I can't pass up. I'm a sucker for carbs in our love hate relationship. Know darn well you should come with an appetite. Start with something off the app list. I love the stuffed hot peppers. This is usually the go to with a side salad with the house dressing. The pasta on the menu that is my go to - the Stuffed Gnocchi Abruzzi. Holy moly. Soooo good. Bonus - if you don't see a combo you like under pasta, you can create your own. Same with the pizza. One of my boyfriend's favorites along with the Chicken Parm. For those of you who are hating carbs today, the salad menu also has quite a variety. Done? Not quite....don't forget an order of cannoli to go.  Need an event catered? They do that too. And they have an awesome party room in the basement. For great food and great service, don't pass Pizzazz up. Bookmark it and try them out!"}
{"text":"Wow, first time at this location and I was truly impressed and can understand why the place is so popular.  We made a reservation for late Saturday afternoon, for 15 people.  We arrived and the space was ready and waiting for us.  Our server Carly, could not have been nicer or more efficient.  Very eager to please and accommodating, especially because there were a number of small kids in our party.  We ordered pizza, salad and soft drinks.  There was also complimentary italian bread and butter to munch on, while we waited for the food.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  The pizza, was EXCELLENT, warm, gooey and delicious.  All of our guests, really enjoyed the food, so much so, that several ordered food to-go.  I can't wait to return to Pizzazz on the Circle, to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but I will never go back here. The last few times we've  eaten here, we've have had the absolute worst service. Our last waitress was the rudest person server I've encountered. Because of this woman, we will never go back. It's unfortunate cause we really do enjoy the food. Sorry Pizzaz, you guys need to be careful who you hire. A couple of your waitresses are immensely disrespectful to patrons who dine in. I've never felt more unwelcome and uncomfortable during a meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sit down pizza place in the area. Warrensville Center road at Fairmount. Opened in 1975, this is essentially a classic, casual Italian restaurant that does an enormous carryout business. The pizza and salads are pretty good and they usually are on a wait.  Pizzazz salad is my favorite: basically an antipasto with a very delicious house dressing. There are several pizza options. You can select from theirs or create your own. Classic deluxe (my favorite), Four Cheese, Margarita and Hawaiian are great. They serve wings as well as fish and chips though I've never tried them.  Good wine and beer selection. 5 dollar pints are always a big plus. Outdoor seating in the summer in a mature atmosphere is awesome. All major cards accepted. Great service but they get busy so be patient. Free parking in the back."}
{"text":"For all the amazing food Cleveland has to offer, pizza is not its strong point.  The standards are particularly low, and the pickings are slim.  That said, this is one of the better pizza places out there in the greater Cleveland area.  The pizza is good, if not particularly interesting.  It doesn't have any objectionable qualities: it's not too greasy, not too salty, and it's a step up from any of the mainstream pizza chains.  The atmosphere is very snazzy for a pizza place...sleek, modern, but in a classy sort of way.  It's a spacious place too, and can usually accomodate very large groups without much trouble.  When I lived in Cleveland I wouldn't eat much pizza but if I were in the mood for it, I would never object to going to this place."}
{"text":"Nice clean place close to the school.  I ordered a calzone.  It would have been good, but.... They put an extremely large amount of toppings to the point that it was overwhelming.  For example.  Instead of eating pepperoni, I was eating stacks of pepperoni.  Also my pineapple was hard.  Basically (gross). It would have been fine if they didn't dump the entire can of pineapple on the pizza.    But, the pizzas looked good, and the other at the dinner party enjoyed their meals.  I'm sure it's better than 3 stars, but my meal wasn't.    Cheers."}
{"text":"Despite living close to this place, my family has not eaten here frequently.  After my last visit, I am clueless as to why that is the case.  First of all, they have a very good beer (bottle and draft) selection, and a full bar.  Always a plus.  Great apps - we shared the calamari and the fried mozz.  We don't usually get fried mozz, but this place has some of the best we've ever had.  The salads are pretty good, too.  They have a large salad that my wife and I split, and still had enough to take home.  Those who have commented on the house Italian are right on the money - it is very good.  We shared some pizza.  One minor complaint here is that my wife ordered meatball and it appears we got sausage instead.  Still tasted okay, though.  In general, the pizzas are very good.  I have had their sheet pizzas on other occasions, and they are also outstanding.  The biggest complaint would be regarding the shrimp tacos I ordered.  The waitress gave me her recommendation, and although they looked appetizing, they were only so-so.  I thought the idea of tacos at an Italian restaurant was strange, and I should have stuck with my gut.  Maybe the others are better...all I know is I'll be having some pasta next time.  Overall, a very nice visit.  Service and food were good, and the family left full and happy."}
{"text":"Normal good pizza, lots of good pasta and other options, need more appetizer options... Had Excellent quick and friendly service tonight... Easy parking... Bar inside... Affordable price...a university heights must"}
{"text":"I get nostalgic for Pizzazz. Hostessing there was my very first restaurant job back when I was 16 was at the Solon location (no longer open) and I used to love sampling everything on the menu.   This location of the mini-chain is a nice mix of families and college kids, giving it an eclectic cozy feeling.   I love that they have a variety of sauces for your pizza, and I've never had a bad one. By far, my fave is the diablo (red sauce with roasted hot peppers...spicy, but not too spicy to enjoy). The raspberry vinaigrette they put on the mesculn salad is pretty noteworthy, as well."}
{"text":"Went here with the rents the other day. Just around the corner from my sibling's house! I will bump it up one more star. The bread was warm and the olive oil I asked for was really nice. The salad dressing is kick ass and did I mention bread was warm. Yeah I'm back to the carbs, lost a little too much weight!  The chicken parm was great like the last time and still is under 11$, I had lunch for the next day!  The calzone my parental units got look really good and they seemed to enjoy it. It was vegetarian and that goes against my 1st rule of calzone. Calzone must have some type of pork product so I did not sample it.  BTW you must try the grilled chicken salad. Sometimes less is more and that is definitely the case with this bom-chicky- chicky salad!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????order??piazza?????????????????????????piazza????????????tips????????????d????????d???????????......"}
{"text":"The Pizzazz Salad is to die for.  I'm also a big fan of their chicken sausage. It's great alone or on a pizza with red peppers and artichoke hearts.  They can get pretty busy, but the staff is very nice.  It's a great place for a date or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Average food. Good selection of salads. Portion sizes for entrees tend to be large. I usually can get two meals out of it. Consistently good, never great."}
{"text":"Stopped by Pizzazz today to get a quick bite for lunch after I got my hair cut next door.  Pizzazz is awesome for a reasonable, delicious meal.  Only about a mile from my dorm room, this was a no brainer  I ordered the Char Chicken Maria, which is two pieces of grilled chicken topped with artichokes, red peppers, and provolone cheese with grilled asparagus and zucchini on the side.  I was looking for something healthy and tasty, and this definitely came through for me.  After my calculations, I estimated this dish to be around 650 calories ... SWEET!  Too bad I didn't remember it was Taco Tuesday (50% off tacos)!    Pizzazz is a great option, especially for me, since it's only a short walk away from John Carroll's campus.  I've had pizza, pasta, and chicken dishes from here and all of them have been nothing short of great.  Definitely check out Pizzazz if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza spot right by John Carroll University in University Heights. My family loves to go here in the summer and sit out on the patio. The salads and dressing are really good - everything I have ordered has been great, but favorite is still the pizza! The staff could be a little more professional...lots of young staff probably students from the university. Great spot though!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night because it was convenient. I had never been but heard the pizza was pretty good and have been wanting to try it. Upon walking in, I was a little surprised at the atmosphere- I guess I expected it to be a bit more classier. You could definitely get away with casual dress, as it's more like a bar/tavern atmosphere. Regardless, we were seated immediately (even late on a Saturday night) and brought a basket of \"rolls\" (looked like ciabatta), which were served with Italian dressing to dip them in. The fresh, soft bread kept me satisfied until our meals came.  My brother and I ended up splitting the large calzone; we chose to fill it with chicken, onions, mushrooms, and red peppers. It was cooked perfectly- slightly brown on top, with lots of gooey melted cheese in the middle. The chicken was good, not the least bit dry, and the vegetables were all fresh...if only they had been sauteed a little instead of crunchy and raw. It was a decent calzone and plenty big for the two of us to split. I also stole a bite of the mesclun salad, which I highly recommend. I could put that raspberry dressing on anything!  Before I can really judge this restaurant, I'll have to order a pizza on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I don't go often to the place but am a huge huge consumer of their deliveries. Pizzazz makes great and tasty food. Pesto pizza and 4-cheese calzones are decadent and a must. I'm a little bit upset for the disappearance of their best starter from the menu (which was the absolutely amazing pesto bruschetta) but the place is totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm in the minority in thinking Pizzazz on the Circle is a tad overrated? I used to think the world of Pizzazz. Perhaps it's the same as I once remembered, only now my hypothetical pizza-palette has matured since experiencing other great pie's since I first met Pizzazz? Then again, perhaps my criticisms are perfectly warranted....  The decor is quite different from the original Pizzazz on SOM Center. I'll even go as far as saying I prefer the Mayfield location to this one. Gasp! This Pizzazz boasts a large, brightly lit dining room. The building is newer and lacks some of the character of the original location. It's loud and often crowded. I think better light control would help tame the crowd, but I digress.    Patrons include a good mix of college students from nearby John Carrol to families with kids. Lot's of boisterous kids. Forget about a relaxing meal at this place because it can get quite loud. The Mayfield location is a bit more conducive to a relaxed dining experience than this location.   One thing that bothers me are the pictures on the website. They're a bit misleading and seem to be a stark contrast to the food that is served here. Now, I'm not saying the food is horrendous, but the website boasts some really vivid food imagery that resembles up-scale Italiano food. Pizzazz is clearly not that.   For an appetizer, we started with a side of fried cheese ravioli's which ended up resembling a pierogi; so much so, I almost asked for a side of sour cream and apple sauce. Fried rav's should be breaded and stuffed with oozy cheese. This one was an oily round mass of un-breaded pasta stuffed with dry cheese. Very unappetizing.   For our main course, we split a calzone (sicilian) and small pizza (pepperoni & italian sausage). Both were passable, but with reservations. The calzone contained capicola & genoa salami with onions, fresh mushrooms, spinach & provolone cheese. One odd thing that stood out to me was the raw red onions. It left a pungent taste in my mouth for the rest of the evening. I would've preferred them to be sautéed prior to them being stuffed in my calzone.   As for the pizza, it was decent, but nothing better than average. The dough was a bit too doughy. The sauce a bit too bland and the toppings a bit too greasy. For a 9\", four-cut pizza at $9.25, I expected more.   Perhaps in title, but lacking in definition; I'm still trying to figure out where the dazzling style, flamboyance and flair that inspired the title \"Pizzazz\" came from."}
{"text":"The service is awful but the pizza is really good!! I've been there twice now and both times I had to wave down our waiter to get their attention every time I needed something. The chicken wings were okay. The salad was also okay and the chicken on top of it was cold but had a grilled chicken flavor to it. The pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is kind of cold but nobody I know has ever acknowledged it. Service is fine and many young people work there. Pizza is fine but not the best I've ever had, or even the best in Cleveland. Salad dressing is really acidic. Also, fries? At an Italian place?"}
{"text":"Although I live and work closer to the Pizzazz in Mayfield Village, I think the University Heights location is much nicer.  The menu is different (and better, in my opinion) and the decor isn't circa 1975.    I went to Pizzazz on a busy Friday night and got to sit in the bar area.  Boy, was it packed!  You could tell that a lot of the local regulars were there watching NCAA basketball.  I ordered a dinner salad and a spinach cheese calzone and my boyfriend ordered cavatelli with marinara sauce.  As always, the salad was delicious!  I always enjoy the mountain of cheese that they put on their salads and I think their house dressing is seriously one of the best Italian dressings I've ever had.  I love dunking the fresh, warm bread that they bring to the table in the dressing.  Despite how busy it was, our server was very attentive.  She kept checking on us and refilling our drinks.  When my calzone arrived, it was oozing with cheese, just the way I like it.  My boyfriend's pasta looked as exciting as cavatelli can.  He said it was just ok but my calzone was good as always.    If you're ever in University Heights and are craving some good, down-home Italian grub, this is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, extensive menu and wonderful, young enthusiastic servers.  It is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant we go to regularly."}
{"text":"Pizzazz is just a typical \"Italian\" restaurant in my opinion. They have your pastas, pizzas, calzones... I'm actually unsure why they are so popular when Little Italy is just 15 minutes away. I'm going to guess convenience, since it is located across the street from John Carroll University (and that is exactly how I ended up there!).  I went after class with some friends and found it to be very mediocre. All three of our entrees were just unimpressive, though definitely edible. The cost of the meal I found to be just a tad expensive considering I wasn't having any mouthgasms. As a side note, I have also previously had their pizzas, which is what they are known for. Again... just some pretty typical pizza. I honestly would rather eat Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I don't think Pizzazz lives up to its hype. The food is fine, but I have never been there and had good service. Last time I went, we ordered salad and pizza and waited 45 minutes!! During that long wait, not one person came and checked up on our table or gave us an update.   Pizzazz is definitely a family friend restaurant. They have options from salad, to pizza, to pastas, to tacos- something for all ages. I'm not quite sure they need to have tacos on their menu considering it's an Italian restaurant!   One thing that is a hit at Pizzazz is the warm rolls they bring out with their delicious house Italian dressing. While I was there and waited for 45 minutes for food, I think someone should have stopped by and asked our table if we wanted more rolls (they start out by bringing 4).   Overall, the food is decent, but service definitely could be improved."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress staff and very attentive. I had the garden calzone which is very good, especially with the artichoke hearts.  I recommend this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"They say the definition of insanity is repeating the same efforts and expecting a different outcome. Every time I come here I have my hopes up that the food has improved and each time I am disappointed. The location in Mayfield Village is far superior - everything there is expertly prepared and served, and in comparison the food here is just okay. The calzones really show the biggest difference between the two locations - here the crust is so overcooked it is crunchy and hard to cut through, while at the MV location it is lightly browned and SO delicious!  I just need to get over the fact that this location is closer to me and make the extra drive - it is so incredibly worth it!"}
{"text":"The diablo sauce is a little spicy, if you like that.  The servers have always been friendly here, and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"They have one of the best tasting pizzas on the east side. Great for college students at John Carroll University.  They also just added chicken & steak tacos to their menu, and I must say, they are now one of my favorite items they offer.  I was a little leery trying tacos from a pizza place, but they are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here with friends. The warm Pizzazz sub with capicola, ham, & provolone on a  sesame seed bun was tasty, and really loved the option for grilled asparagus & zucchini instead of fries. A friend enjoyed the grilled portobello, and another had the Italian sub. Friendly & fast service. Cool location on the circle!"}
{"text":"Great family neighborhood restaurant with friendly service!  Located just off Fairmount Circle...."}
{"text":"Was going to have an event here. Emailed, fb messaged and called. No one got back to me."}
{"text":"We stopped in the other day, myself and AN, we split the chips and guac, a small pizza with double pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, onion and green pepper, it's our traditional date night pizza. And for dessert we had the cannoli! It was the best pizza we've ever had and AN and myself have had pizza all over the U.S. from NY, to California, to Chicago and many more places, Pizzazz is still the best pizza, the best service and always feels like home."}
{"text":"Picked up pizza from Pizzazz the other night. Our order was pretty straightforward: large pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted garlic. $16 for a large was slightly expensive to me.  When I took the pizza out of the box, it was completely sodden with grease (unfortunately, that is no exaggeration). The pizza was soggy and bland. While they get kudos for having great ingredients (the mushrooms were very fresh and delicious), their pizza on a whole was not very good. We ended up tossing over half the pizza because it was so inedible.  We picked this place because of all the great reviews, but the pizza here is not that great! There's so many other places that have way better pizza for cheaper!"}
{"text":"I ate at Pizzazz the other day with a group of friends and was not overly impressed with the food or service - this was not my first time to Pizzazz. The restaurant itself is clean and there is a lot of easy parking nearby. We were quickly seated when we arrived and waited on.   The one thing that did bother me was there was no attention to detail by the wait staff. Everyone was friendly, and I know this isn't a 5 star restaurant, but there were a number of hiccups that should have been easy fixes yet took a while to correct (missing silverware, unfilled drinks, plates delivered to the wrong people, no salt and pepper at table, and no extra napkins). These issues could have been easily resolved if the wait staff just checked in and asked if we needed anything, especially since they were not too busy when we went.  The food was not bad. Pizza itself can be made a million different ways and you can like one but not another. I am not a huge fan of the way that Pizzazz makes their pizza, and it was very greasy, which I also didn't like.  Pricing was reasonable - I was able to get a personal pizza, salad, and beer for right around $20. My friends do like to meet up here, so I'm sure I will be back. Hopefully my experience next time will be better!"}
{"text":"Came out to lunch with family that has been coming here for quite some time and had the perfect little lunch! It's clean, cute, and offers extremely quick, polite and friendly service. We all had various salads and shared the calamari and shrimp appetizer. I had the Strawberry salad which was lovely: fresh and bright, great fruit on top. The house Italian dressing is super tasty! And I have to say, the calamari and shrimp (sautéed not fried) was SO good. Great kick to the sauce and I could have had the entire appetizer on my own. Everyone's  salads were huge, a joke was made that a whole back yard  garden was on their plates! Great amount of food and tasty quality! No complaints and next time I'll splurge for trying the pizza, which I hear good things about!"}
{"text":"Great selection of draft beer especially for such a small place. Definitely better selection of beer than that \"speakeasy\" place downstairs (HA! found you sucker via wifi network).  Mech, pompous bartender down there for a such a low rundown bar.  I got the El Diablo specialty pizza and added pineapples on it. Spicy advertised. Spiciness denied... well for the most part. The pizza is a bit watery. Not cool especially for those who love to eat with their hands.  All the waitresses, presumably college girls with John Carroll University next door,  wear spandex pants and black v-necks. Yea yea yea, some eye candy you suppose, but not really. You have to see my girlfriend with hers on. I know, iBrag.  4 for beer.  2.5 for food. You can't budge me for a 4. Sorry!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I were in the neighborhood and decided to give Pizzazz a shot. A very clean, well dressed neighborhood restaurant was just what we got. Split between two dining areas, we opted for the \"Bar Side\". A spacious area with a 15 seat bar and ample seating including both booths and tables. After being seated by the hostess we were greeted by a waitress almost immediately. The best part was, she had the hot bread on our table top before even asking for our drink order! I was in Heaven already. The beer selection was more than I expected. From locals to crafts, they had it all. If your a domestic beer drinker they have you covered as well. About 12 Beers on tap I chose the Buckeye IPA (Lakewood, Oh)  We started off with a few Stuffed Peppers (4 for $8.50) and an order of Kale Sprouts ($5) Both came out in a timely manner and both dishes were amazing. I ordered the Chicken Parm ($11.50) Two large breaded breasts and a nice pile of penne paste. Let's just say It was enough to feed two.  The service was phenomenal. Not only was our waitress on top of everything, and the manager was very helpful as well.  For those who are saying this place is over priced?! I couldn't disagree more. Well worth the cost and we will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"I'm an undergraduate at John Carroll and this has always been my go to if I'm not feeling the cafe food. I got the seafood pasta and it was great. The shrimp was excellent and the Diablo sauce was perfect. The atmosphere of pizzazz is great, everyone is so friendly! I defiantly suggest you come check this place out!"}
{"text":"My partner and I had spaghetti with olive oil and fresh tomatoes and were not terribly impressed. The pasta was way overcooked and the dish looked drab and was kind of tasteless. Over all, we felt the place was just going through the motions of trying to stay afloat as a business; there was little joy in the service, interior decor or presentation of food. It reminded us of a candidate for an episode of a restaurant-salvation TV reality show, although the place was reasonably busy. Maybe the pizza is a draw, but I had it several years ago and it was only okay."}
{"text":"Food as good as ever, but the wait staff was not adequate on the patio. One person for 10 tables?  Won't stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"It's not great - it's good.  Tastes the same as it did when I was in high school.  Friendly staff, and I have only had one bad experience having frequented this place for over 15 years.  Pizza is good, but sometimes a little soggy.  Their chicken parm sandwich is good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered gnocchi and a pesto pizza and we were slightly disappointed with our order. My husband used to love their food but did not find their food as appetizing as before--I had never had their food and found it to be mediocre. My advice would be to find another pizza place with more pizzazz!"}
{"text":"This is our standby for the nights that we don't feel like cooking. We get the same things every time because they're solid and delicious:   Hot wings. They seriously have some of the best wings in CLE.  Pepperoni pizza, thick crust, with diablo sauce (its a must if you like things spicy) Grilled chicken salad - I don't know how a restaurant manages to make such good salad, but the fresh ingredients are always perfect.   We always get takeout. The staff is mostly young high school and college girls...and definitely leaves something to be desired in terms of service. Can't go wrong with carry out though."}
{"text":"A classic and Cleveland staple! I've been coming here for years and love it every time. The food is excellent- fresh and homemade. Menu is huge with a lot to choose from- not just pizza. Will continue to come and enjoy this place."}
