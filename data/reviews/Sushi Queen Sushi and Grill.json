{"text":"Wonderful sushi at extremely reasonable prices.  They also have great  specials.  Dined with my two little kids who each had a kid meal. At $3.50 - 4.50 each it is one of the least expensive kid meals in town, comes with chicken, shrimp or beef, rice, carrots, broccoli & mushrooms.  I started with a house salad with ginger dressing.  The dressing was different than any other I've had but I thought it was better. Service was great too. We will be back!,"}
{"text":"Ok i drove past this place many times and never gave it a second look.  Why? Cause it's in a strip mall in a Walmart plaza, that is why! I couldn't imagine how good or safe the sushi would be!!  Well happy to say after reading the reviews I tentatively tried his place and honestly was not expecting much at all! Well wow! I was pleasantly surprised!  It was quite excellent!  I got the special roll combination and it was very good.  I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Sushi Queen~! I Love Their Sushi. Came In For The First Time Today And The Sushi Is Really Tasty, Both, Raw And Cooked Sushi. Fresh Ingredients, Extremely Clean, Nice Management And Workers, And Overall A Superb Environment. I Have Lived In Every Major City In The U.S. And Haven't Found Sushi Quite Like Sushi Queen's. I Ordered The OMG Roll, Fire Roll, And Corn Roll, And It's Made With Fresh Tuna, Eel, and Vegetables. Also Love Their Ice Cream Desserts! P.S Fast Service. Looking Forward To Trying The Tuna Tataki! Again, Great Place For Our Taste Buds!   -Sam"}
{"text":"This place is a pleasant surprise in an unassuming wrapper.   I tried the Sushi Queen today and will definitely do so again. Today is it's half price sushi day. You can get select rolls at half off of the menu price. I was surprised by the limited yet diverse selection.   I had the rainbow roll and the half off yellowtail rolls. For a starter, I tried the rice balls. Everything was fresh. Everything was delicious. It was so good, that I ordered a dish to go. My togo  order was their Imperial Dinner with Yakisoba Noodles instead of rice. Lo and behold, this dish was excellent as well.   I have only one word to describe the service. IMPECCABLE!!!  These lil ladies need to teach a seminar on customer service. The lady who prepared my sushi actually took a moment to come to my table to see if I was pleased. I could only give her a thumbs up because my mouth was full. Lol  Great service + Fresh/Delicious Food + Giants/Cowboys on the flat screen + a very very reasonable price especially for the quality = SUSHI QUEEN is a must try for any novice or sushi expert."}
{"text":"Amazing service and INCREDIBLE sushi!!! Was not expecting this level of flavor out in the middle of Concord but was definitely surprised. Very affordable too."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in search of something good in the area and yelped nearby restaurants.  Sushi Queen came up and had great reviews.  We thought to give it a try - we ordered takeout.  My hubby picked up the food and shared that the ladies working (owners) were very pleasant to chat with during his wait.  The order time was fair - 15 minutes because we had a last minute sushi order.  The food is yummy - we ordered hibachi.  The food was hot and not overcooked.  The meats were tender - hubby ordered  - steak hibachi and commented that it was tender.  We are excited they at so near as we normally travel to Charlotte for hibachi.  Now we have a place near home.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A true hidden gem.  Taste and presentation was a excellent and the service was outstanding.  Can't wait till next time we are in town to revisit Sushi Queen."}
{"text":"We had dinner here before the Charlotte NASCAR. I ordered Shrimp Yakisoba while my gf ordered Tofu Chicken rice noodles. I thought this was a traditional Japanese restaurant but it turn out to be more of a Asian fusion. Yakisoba is not bad but you have to finish fast cuz it gets cold so quick, a warm dish would make it much more enjoyable. The tofu Chicken rice noodles however, is not our favorite. It's a bit plain for us and we were expecting more flavors. If you are using Google map for navigation, it's on the right hand side when you are facing Walmart rather than the left :) Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! Always fresh and tasty. My go to spot when I don't feel like cooking and don't want greasy fast food. Best of all they have sushi specials for every day of the week. My favorite is Tuesday when they have happy hour. I go here more often than I'd like to admit but it's just so delicious!  Their ginger dressing is awesome. Favorite rolls are Philly roll, OMG roll, and Tiger roll."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! Its really nice and clean and all the waitresses are nice and helpful. Its so nice to be able to get tasty and quality sushi and hibachi so close to my home. Prices are reasonable and they have really great specials pretty much everyday! I totally recommend."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the prices are AWESOME.  It's a VERY small restaurant, and the service can be either somewhat slow or very slow due to what sushi orders are ahead of yours.  We ate in the restaurant three times, and had a good experience in spite of the wait. We typically order takeout now, and the food as excellent when eating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're looking an intimate and enjoyable meal, this is the place to go. I found this little gem on Yelp! and I'm glad I did. The sushi was fresh and the entree was made to order. The staff was friendly and made sure each guest was comfortable and happy. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area! Fast service and fresh food. We will be back when we have a sushi craving."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh ingredients and combined well. Small but quaint. Great quality food. I plan to go here again."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi places around..! This place is a gem and the sushi is yummy and always fresh! My favorite is the Tuna Titaki roll! Their hibachi and noodles choices are also off the chain!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great place in the middle of nowhere. I feel like they could get much more business if they moved to a different location. It has become our go to place to get sushi."}
{"text":"I may be the only one to give this low of a review, but I have my reasons. All the sushi looks amazing in these pictures. We assumed there would be an extensive sushi list, and there was. But not much that accommodated vegetarians/vegans. There were maybe 4 veggie rolls, so we ordered 3 and they were good, nothing to rave about. We also got the tofu hibachi and it was just alright. The waitress put in an order for 2 hibachi sly but we only ordered 1. The fried rice wasn't really fried and had a floral aroma to it. No, it wasn't ginger, it smelled/tastes like flowers lol. Anywho, we won't be going back because of the lack of vegan options, and the hibachi and sushi rolls were just ehh. Besides the waitress doubling our order, she was very nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time! Delicious food,  amazing sushi. Amazing service! The people are kind and the place is clean. We sat next to a regular who said this is the best place in town! I agree. Nothing compares."}
{"text":"Looking for sushi without going to Charlotte, I found this gem on Yelp. 5 miles from my hotel and tucked away in a shopping center, I walked in and was greeted immediately. We sat, the place is small and not lavish. Had soup, salad (with ginger dressing) and two incredible rolls. This place was great."}
{"text":"Imanagative!  Unfortunately I can give 5 stars!  The menu has many unique offerings. The chef owner is well blessed with her creativity.  We tried 6 rolls and all were completely different from each other and completely different from anything we have ever had before. The sushi provides your pallet a wonderful experience that you never want to end. I have every intention of returning as often as I can. The food was perfection and the waitstaff was very courteous. If that wasn't enough the pricing of everything is very affordable and well worth the experience. If you do get the chance I would recommend trying their dessert roll as it is like nothing you will ever see anywhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I'd really give it about 3.5. I travel for a living, so I've had a ton of good sushi. I wasn't expecting much, in Concord, NC. This was pretty good. Not amazing, but good. Decent prices. I had the Fried Green Tomatoes. It's deep fried, then topped with cream cheese, salmon and scallions. It was the most bizarre thing! I don't know why that works, but I does. A little watery, so it fell apart half way through, but good. Then I had the White Blossom Roll. THAT was good! What a delicious mix of flavors, a little sweet, spicy, tangy, savory....lovely roll. Friendly staff, and a sweet, young girl making the sushi. I came for lunch on a weekday. No wait. Pretty quick in and out."}
{"text":"We tried Sushi Queen tonight on a whim as ALL the other Asian restaurants in concord are closed on Sunday.       We were not disappointed. Sunday's are 1/2 off certain specialty rolls which we tried (OMG roll, Fire roll and another one that I forgot)....    The OMG and Fire roll were very delicious and I highly recommend them. The Spicy Tuna and shrimp Tempura roll were ok but nothing amazing. We also had 2 pieces of yellow tail nigiri which were very generous portions.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Trying to eat sushi is a nightmare with my long list of allergies- they were very accommodating! The staff was super friendly, and even though I did get take out, they met my every need, especially with my allergies. I got the veggie delight sushi, and it was great! Most definitely will be making this my go-to sushi place :)"}
{"text":"Southern hospitality meets GREAT sushi!! Great rolls on the menu, but they will make whatever you want!! Thursdays is $3 off any Dragon roll, and you can make substitions! Great sushi, service, and prices! Oh, and by the way, the beer is cold!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I'm not going to change the stars on this review because the sushi is excellent and has been excellent every time I've gone... however, I will advise that you stick to the Sushi... the hibachi is not good.   Hands down the absolute best sushi I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of sushi.  I didn't try this restaurant for years because it is in a run down strip mall that I try to avoid because the traffic pattern around this area is terrible, but it is the closest place to my home that serves sushi and I was really craving some sushi today.  I could not be happier that I tried it, the cashier was incredibly nice and the sushi was AMAZING!  Please don't let looks deceive you like I did for so many years, try this restaurant, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"I was a little taken aback when we walked in. It wasn't I expected but I am so glad I stayed. The food was awesome,  and really priced well. Do not forget to get the cheesecake which is deep fried in tempura batter!"}
{"text":"Good portion sizes. My favorites were OMG & Fantasy rolls. Hot mama was definitely spicy ;-)"}
{"text":"Fresh, Fast, Friendly!  This little gem is a wonderful place to get your sushi and hibachi fix. I have not been disappointed by anything that we have tried so far.  Also, the shrimp sauce is an addictive addition to the fried rice.  Give this place a try if you are wanting some authentic Japanese cuisine!  I wish we could give 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Small place, easy to miss in the Walmart shopping center.  Daily specials, lunch specials and happy hour make the prices very reasonable. The sushi is good, very fresh (you can watch them make it) Next time I'll try a hibachi dish."}
{"text":"We were in town for a soccer game and need a quick bit for lunch. We had great service and great food."}
{"text":"I love this place....the food is so very delicious and always fresh.  The staff is friendly! I would recommend to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"First time here and we enjoyed it. My husband had the chicken and steak teriyaki with an extra side of rice. He loved it. We came here because he wanted sushi and I hate sushi but didn't mind the other items on the menu. I explained to the waitress that I didn't like sushi because of the seaweed. She proposed that I try it with the rice paper instead. I got the veggie lover (tempura style) with the rice paper and OMG it was sooooo good!!! I will definitely be coming back for more. I had the ramen type noodles, it was just ok but again sushi made up for it. Service was rellly great as well."}
{"text":"I am sooo happy the place near my house I had planned on going to was closed! The extra drive to Sushi Queen was well worth it. I loved their menu - vegetarian options are fantastic. I got veggie tempura ($3.99 - amazing price/quality), a house salad (huge portion, great dressing), tofu teriyaki w/fried rice and sweet carrots, and a veggie lovers roll with soy paper, which was simply divine. The had several creative veggie rolls - not just the run of the mill cucumber & avocado. I loved it all - I definitely didn't need all of that food but I like to sample a few things my first visit.   My friend got actual sushi (non-veggie) and he said it was great. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Suishi was okay. Nothing to brag about. I am a sushi lover. The sushi here is fresh and beautiful to look at but the sauces ruined the overall taste. I went here three times wanting to support small businesses and that maybe they will have perfected their sauces. To no avail... The hibachi or any of the rice dishes with meat...were over cooked and over sauced with no real taste to them...as if the sauces would cover up it up."}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! Very nice place to have a casual lunch and chow down. Sexy Dragon Roll, Spicy tuna roll, and miso soup were all wonderful!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the sushi was great, I ordered the sexy dragon roll and it was amazing. There were many options for sushi and they all look good 10/10 would eat here again"}
{"text":"We just relocated to the area and were looking for a really good sushi place. Well, lo and behold we found it! Great food and service. We'll definite be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Pulling into the strip mall I wasn't sure what to expect. The restaurant is small but very clean. We were seated and waited on by an extremely friendly member of the waitstaff. My wife and I were floored by all the specialty rolls and ordered 5 different ones. (Omg, rainbow, rock n roll, brown dragon and Golden girl). It took around an hour to get our food which trust me was worth the wait. The care and meticulous craftsmanship of sushi was amazing and utterly delicious. We fell in love!! Five stars is not enough. 10 stars fit this place. It was our first time and it will not be our last. Thank you Sushi Queen!!"}
{"text":"My career has me constantly traveling throughout the surrounding Charlotte-Metro area and honestly, I love it! I think my mom was the first person to tell me about this place, and since my last customer visit was in the same shopping center around lunch time, it was a no-brainer.  Just a teeny-tiny Asian grill in the strip mall to the right of Walmart, Sushi Queen fills the gap between high-end sushi joints and just settling for fast food. The restaurant itself is minimal-frills for the most part, but upkeep is good and clean.  For lunch I got the Spicy Tuna roll and a Hibachi Chicken & Steak. Considering the price, you get a LOT of food. Spicy Tuna was very simple, as expected since this wasn't a combination roll (it was essentially a maki roll), and at $6 was a steal! The chili sauce they use isn't too spicy, and I would have liked it a bit hotter but the Tuna had a great texture. I'll give a special roll a try next time!  As for the Hibachi entree, had I known it would be as big as it was I probably would have skipped on the roll! $11 gets you a Soup or Salad, a huge helping of rice, Japanese steakhouse-style carrots, and some mixed veggies (mushroom, and broccoli). Was really surprised that the waitress asked how I wanted my steak cooked because most smaller Hibachi places just cook it well. I asked for medium and I'll be damned if I didn't get medium! Great rice, perfect seasoning on the meats, and even the mushrooms had a body & flavor that is usually overlooked at other places. The carrots were just the right amount of sweetness, A+.  For the price, you're not going to find anything better anywhere around here. Don't come here expecting lavish offerings of Hamachi or burger-sushi fusion (no really, it's a thing!), however the dishes they do offer are fantastic. Mama didn't steer me wrong, I guess lunch is on me next time!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the most unassuming spot. This is, hands down, the best sushi I have had in Concord. Even Charlotte for that matter! My boyfriend and I try to eat here at least a couple times a month.  Do yourself a favor and get the fried green tomatoes to start. I promise you, it will knock your socks off. The tomatoes are covered in a cream cheese salmon mix that is out of this world. Your taste buds will thank you.  You can't go wrong with any of their sushi rolls. We recently ventured out and gave the hibachi a shot and we were not disappointed. Next time, I'm going to try their yakisoba noodle bowl. If you have the chance to go here, do it. Take your friends here who claim that they don't like sushi. You'll turn them into huge fans!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy, and the service is outstanding. We live out of town and drove an hour today to have lunch here. They are happy to omit or substitute items & will even create a custom roll for you upon request. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This sushi is so good. We got the OMG Roll and the Fire Ball roll without cream cheese and they are amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is over hyped. The chicken teriyaki is bland and dry. The sushi was also bland and I tried the hot papa as well as spicy salmon roll. Plenty better Japanese places in town. Hokkaido is by far the best and down the street!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight after seeing all of the positive reviews, and since I moved closer to concord I figured I should give it a shot.  I can easily say I'm not impressed at all. I got the Yakisoba noodles with steak, the steak was supposed to be medium-but was super tough & bland and so were the noodles. It did not have any hibachi flavor at all. I also tried the Hot papa roll and Fantasy roll, both were also ok but I guess I can't expect 5 star sushi in a small town like concord. My boyfriend tonight had the Teriyaki steak & shrimp and his also lacked in flavor. The only good thing on his plate was the carrots. For sushi he got the Smoky mountain roll and he liked it. For $56 I'm disappointed in what I ate tonight. Our server was nice(hence the extra star), and the food did take a while but I'd save myself the trip and stay in Charlotte next time for some food."}
{"text":"This was an okay sushi restaurant. I ordered a salad with ginger dressing. The dressing was a little watery and did not have enough ginger flavor. I also had a shrimp tempura roll. It was good. I asked for eel sauce because it's my favorite. I think I missed the lunch special but it very reasonably priced. I would return for the sushi and try something else but not get the salad."}
{"text":"It's okay, nothing to write home about. They need a new recipe for the shrimp sauce. Theirs is more like washed out 1000 Island dressing. Sushi rolls are okay. Again, not earth shattering."}
{"text":"Read the reviews, \"a local gem\" hmmm, definitely worth a try. My wife daughter and I loved it. We started fresh spring roll and an order of edamame, I've had better fresh spring rolls but it wasn't bad, you can't mess up edamame so an okay start.  The rolls were very good, on Sundays they have 1/2 off their corn roll both my wife and I tried it and were very happy with the choice, I also had the Sexy Dragon roll along with a California roll to round out my meal.  My daughter's rolls we also delicious.  We all lived our rolls and am posting pictures, we will definitely comeback and try other daily specials including lunch specials.  Beers were $3.50 including the imports, we tried the Kirin Light and the Lucky Buddha, good and cold can't beat it.  The place is a little hole in the wall you will miss it if you aren't careful but most definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place and have been more times that we can count. The party platters are the best deal we have never found on sushi and it still taste great. We love that you can choose what you want and change it up every time you order it. We have had all the options on the special rolls platter, the dragon roll platter, and a lot of rolls off the menu. We have never had anything bad. My favorite appetizer is the fried green tomatoes. They also have daily specials and all of those rolls are wonderful also."}
{"text":"my my i cant believe that i have never checked in here from yelp! i love love love love this place!!! if you love sushi you will love this place!!   yes its small but perfect!   also great customer services always ! great good alway!!!    i can't wait until their new location will open)it's closer to me). it gonna be on off north tryon by the new neighborhood wal-mart and across the street from star light movie and q-t"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unassuming corner next to a Walmart, this sushi joint is definitely a gem in the rough. A casual and cozy atmosphere is combined with courteous staff who do a perfect job of getting you in and out for lunch. But the real surprise is the sushi, which is far superior than its humble location might belie. You'll love such fantastically presented dishes as the Orange Dragon, with shrimp tempura ends on each side and sliced orange in between. The soups, appetizers, and sauces are equally as good. And, to top it all off, they run daily specials all week.  A welcome addition, Sushi Queen is not to be passed up!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi! We came in just before 1pm but the place was almost full. I ordered 2 rolls, 1 cold spicy ahi tuna, and 1 hot shrimp tempura on their 2-rioll lunch special. I took my first bite of tuna and it was delicate, spicy, and I can actually taste the tuna and sesame and it was still cold and fresh. The shrimp tempura was okay. My hubby got cali and spicy salmon and he thought his salmon was fresh and tasteful. My son had 3 rolls, one of which was the eel and it was  plentiful and visibly appealing. He told me they were all good. Service was very good. Hope, our server made eye contact with me right away as I walked in and while waiting on  my two companions. She handed me the menu as she ushered me into a table with 4 chairs. The place was small but could easily sit about 40-50 with strategically placed tables and chairs. It's located in a shopping area just next to a Walmart so even though the place is not fancy, the food was excellent and service top notch! Thanks to yelpers! I found this spot by looking up sushi while we were driving on I-85 South towards Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! By far the best I've had in the Concord area. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Thanks to this app we found this gem while in town for a concert. The miso and creamy crab salad is the way to start out. We all bought about 8 different rolls which were all absolutely amazing. If you're in town or within driving distance, do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Wow !! So lucky to find this gem in Concord. Their roll are so creative and full of flavor. The Cherry Blossom has tuna and a surprising piece of lime. Yes lime, it gave the roll a refeshing taste. Sexy Dragon was also good too, I love crab stick and the roll was top with it. Don't forget to order fried green tomatoe, a southern twist on tempura.   This place is run by two sister. Traditional sushi are suppose to be made by men, because of the temperature of the woman hand. Well these sister prove that wrong. The server was attentive and very friendly. You got to try this spot. Very cosy."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the sushi. Also had a chicken and noodles dish that did not have a great flavor. Service is also SUPER slow. We were there for over an hour on a weeknight just waiting for the sushi rolls to come out."}
{"text":"If you know anything about me and food, you know that my girlfriend and I really started exploring restaurants through sushi. From then on, it really has become our goal to find the BEST places in every category; until visiting Sushi Queen, I (we) were convinced that the best sushi to be found was at Now and Zen in Charlottesville, Virginia. We found another place in Alabama (Mikato) that was top-notch, ousting Now and Zen in the service category, but Sushi Queen is the epitome of sushi and service, giving a value for your money that will be hard to find elsewhere!  Located in Concord, NC, a smaller town outside of Charlotte, NC (an extremely big city), this establishment is tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center; it seems as if the best places are really that unassuming from the outside, and this place is no exception. I was lured in (obviously) by the daily specials that someone luckily posted on this establishment's Yelp page, and it is quite remarkable that they offer specials every day! It just so happened that we were coming on a Sunday, where three of their specialty rolls were half-off, and I could not turn down the prospective value!  The server was not phased at all when we came in a little later (under an hour until they closed), and it put us in the best mood, considering this was set to be the end of a great day we had had. The setup of the place is so comfortable, with half-booth-half-table eating areas lining the walls. Putting everything on the outer edge of the room, as well as mirrors on the walls, made the place feel much more spacious (not that it matters much, but it is a nice touch).  There are pillows laying on the couch-like booths as well, contributing to the epitome of comfort apparent in this place.  Reading the menu was definitely enjoyable, as this establishment combines sushi with a large variety of non-sushi items! Sometimes you just want some fried rice on the side, or something nice to make for a bit of variety. We were soon ready to order, as we had been awaiting the meal all day, and our server took our order and, as I said, never seemed phased by the time we arrived, answering all of our questions as positively as possible. We ended up ordering the corn roll (half off), two other rolls (I believe one was vegetarian), and my girlfriend got a sizable portion of lo mein noodles with shrimp and I got a side of rice with mine as well (as the sushi was my main focus).  While we waited, there were TV's playing the Olympics, a nice touch for some reason, even though I do not much like to watch TV (I guess because it was interesting and culturally relevant). The music was nice, current, relevant, and calming. They even have some sort of rewards card (benefits yet to be determined) that I picked up while we were waiting for our food! I certainly cannot wait to see what that has in store, as I love participating in loyalty programs (if they are worth being loyal to!). We did not, however, wait long, and our food was out in front of us before we knew it!  There was so much food and it all looked great in front of us. The sauce that they brought out (that they called \"shrimp sauce\"), apparently called yum yum sauce, tasted good on everything. The meal was rich and filling in all the right ways, and we ate every bit of it! I am happy I got a picture of it before we went to town!  We will undoubtedly be back to this place whenever the occasion arises, and hopefully on Sunday again because the half-off rolls cannot be beat! I recommend this place to anyone in the Charlotte area, as this is the best sushi we have found!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Surprised it wasn't packed. Highly recommended. Try the Fantasy Roll... you will LOVE it."}
{"text":"It's deja vu all over again! Same day, same weather so why not come back for some fabulous sushi and turkey egg rolls?! Tucked away in a strip center, it's easy to miss, so keep your eyes peeled or set the GPS.  Now for the food...There is hibachi, sushi, various appetizers, and the list goes on. I can speak to the sushi. Love it! Tonight we ordered the tuna roll (without spice), fantasy roll, black widow roll, and the red dragon. Check out the pics! The one appetizer we have tried we absolutely love: the turkey egg rolls.  At first thought, you will probably question me, but I, like you, read a Yelp review that said the same thing. You have to try them!! :-)  We have made this place a fav spot after only two visits. I promise that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After leaving a ball tournament we opted to stop close by rather than enduring the traffic around the mall. We were so glad that We tried this place. I was first intrigued by the Fried Green Tomatoes with Smoked Salmon and a cream cheese sauce. Who would think you get could such a thing in a sushi place! They were absolutely amazing!! The mix of flavors was indescribably delicious! My daughter had the kids chicken with noodles which were really good and had a great flavor. We tried the OMG and Golden Girl rolls. Both were out of this world! My husband also had a hibachi plate. He commented that even the fried rice was the best he had tasted. He said many places don't give a lot of attention to the rice but he could tell that this was totally different. I would highly recommend this little spot if you are in Concord!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Sushi places I've had in the area. The place is small but the service and food was great! The Golden girl sushi and  Hot Papa roll is a must try. My kids loved the hibachi. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi and great customer service. I have been to several sushi places in Charlotte and this one is the best one so far. Granted it is new to the area but if they keep up their service and freshness they will be one of the busiest and best places to eat. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the sushi was great and fresh. It is a small place but it is comfortable and family friendly. The staff was very attentive and the food was served in a timely manner. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Friendly small place in strip mall. Fresh and tasty the fourth time so it was time for a review. As Charly said Sunday's are 1/2 off certain specialty rolls and daily specials as well. fast and courteous staff. a must try"}
{"text":"Just returned from Sushi Queen after enjoying a late lunch with my brother. We had the following rolls: Citrus Twist, Sexy Dragon, Sunny California and the Orange Dragon. Yesterday we both enjoyed the Tuna poke salad and shared the Orange Dragon roll. I highly recommend you visit here and you will not be disappointed. Thank you once again for preparing an array of excellent food."}
{"text":"I'm glad there's a delicious sushi place near me now. I've only tried one roll and that's the Eel Dragon Roll. Loved it and I could go back for more!! Have always ordered to-go, but once I dine-in, I will update on that as well.  For now, the ladies are awesome. Drop by when you can and they have specials everyday!"}
{"text":"Love love this place.  Always fresh and fast.  Good prices for the sushi rolls.  So tasty.    They have daily specials.  1/2 price on certain rolls on Sunday's.   My go to spot for sushi."}
{"text":"I love this little place! The staff is friendly and its very clean. Try the crazy roll!"}
{"text":"Went last night and was really impressed. Got the sexy dragon roll and the crunchy roll - both are amazing. Also no complaints about the fried shrimp roll and the spicy crab roll. Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great! Giving 3 stars because hubby ordered chicken and steak and got shrimp and steak. We didn't order a lot, so no reason to have gotten our order wrong. Also, the wait for the food was a lot longer then expected. Price of the hibachi was amazing! Very cheap and tasted good for the price. Sushi price was average for any sushi place. Around $10 for special rolls"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Great specials, friendly staff and close to home. The menu did not have many completely raw rolls like I am used to (outside of NC) but they seemed to incorporate some interesting tastes and sauces so I gave it a try. I think the sauces are they to mask the unfreshness of the fish, unfortunately. I haven't tried their hibachi, so I can't speak to that, but I won't go back for sushi. Golden Taipei is still my favorite in this area. I'll continue to explore but most likely won't be back here."}
{"text":"In Charlotte, this is a pretty good sushi restaurant with plenty of choices. Although their menu with cooked sushis may not be really \"fully cooked\", but in general the sushi is good. Will not say amazing, but by far it is the best I have ever tasted in this area. The Turkey eggroll is plain, not recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a very reasonable price.   We started with the tempura veggies, which were wonderful - I could've eaten an entire plate of the mushrooms.  Then we had an order of the Crab Dragon rolls, which was very good. And an order of the Yellow Dragon rolls. I'm telling you, the Yellow Dragon Rolls are officially my favorite sushi rolls that I've ever had in my entire life.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi."}
{"text":"Great little find! I have claimed this a my new favorite sushi spot because the sushi was tasty and they have great specials! I really enjoy the sushi happy hour on Tuesdays and service is excellent. They are friendly, helpful, and quick!  I've tried the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy yellowtail rolls and was more than pleased. I had chicken hibachi once and was also happy with it."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in Concord. Hands down. We've been regular customers now for over a year. They have outstanding selection of sushi and their dinner entrees are fantastic. Seating could be a little larger but a lot of people do carry out too.  During the week they have sushi specials, on Thursday we got the spicy dragon sushi roll for half off. Everything we've ever tried is great here. They have any kind of sushi you can think of. Don't judge from the outside. It'd not a super upscale fancy sushi place but it doesn't have to be, when your food is that good the inside doesn't matter! Wow!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever .. my favorite is the hot papa roll . I just wish they stayed open longer ."}
{"text":"Great sushi and the fried green tomatoes were amazing. Lunch special is more than enough food for a reasonable price.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been a few times since the grand opening.  I've done take-out, eat-in, lunch and dinner.  It's just OK sushi - nothing fantastic.  Then staff has been nice and helpful during each visit, but I guess I am just expecting a bit more creativity with sushi."}
{"text":"They have just open up a second location of of N. TRYON  past the broadwalk.  So am rating the shop in Charlotte. They are own by the same family.  Okay I gave this place a 5star because I just love everything about it, from the hand drawn art works on the wall by the owners and also from local artwork right here in Charlotte.   The service was a little slow since it is their first week but the still did a really good job, 4 stars plus we was being a little difficult.  Now to the food, we order the fried green tomato, seaweed salad, crozy yellowtail tuna, the salmon belly, these were just the appetizer.  For the actual rolls we got the Black widow, sexy Dragon,  Cherry blossom, and something else it was so much to remember. My favorite one was the Black widow, it do have a kick so if you don't  like spicy that it might not be for you. I also love the fried green tomato top with I think salmon, but it might  have been tuna.   If your not a raw fish person they do have cook items too, they also have hibachi too, my husband got the salmon one and it was cook just right, still moist and the sauce was awesome too. It was not to heavy.  Over al I say give this place a try,they are really good."}
{"text":"After about 8 trips to Sushi Queen, I have never had a Roll here that I didn't enjoy. I've realized that I need to keep a list in my notepad to remember which ones I've tried and which I haven't, since they have at least 40 rolls. I've done both eat in and take out, and the quality is still the same.  The Concord location has some out there rolls, like the Angry Bird Roll which is grilled chicken topped with hot Cheetos. It was worth trying once. I don't recall seeing it on the menu at the new N Tryon location. The Concord restaurant is small, but the newN Tryon one is pretty big, lots of seats and neat artwork. I'm just happy that I don't have to drive all the way to Concord anymore. The new location is right off of 485, on 29- if you're driving from South Charlotte like me.  The food is delicious, comes out promptly, nice casual atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
