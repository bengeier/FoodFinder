{"text":"This is our second time here.  My fiancé and I had Rachel as our server and sat at sushi bar with Jackie.  They were both amazing!  Food was fresh and good.  Happy hour prices for great food and service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Ginny was our server and she was very polite and accommodating. 

My husband and daughter are both picky eaters and they loved the food.

Appetizer: egg rolls 
Hubby: grilled teriyaki steak
Daughter: yakisoba with seafood and vegetables and a side of rice
Me: pork katsu
All of our meals came with salad (choice of sesame or ginger dressing) and miso soup"}
{"text":"Mykala was such a nice hostess, every time i'm there I see her and she's so polite! Great service and food(:"}
{"text":"We have been to Uni several times and have always had a great delicious meal. We don't eat meat, so can only comment on the meatless dishes. The vegetables are fresh and tasty, and the seasonings are awesome. We often bring our visitors to Uni. We will continue to go there and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying\" I don't eat Sushi\".  Therefore I didn't even know what a lot of menu items were but I went with a group that wanted to try it.  I still don't eat sushi but ordered the Chicken Tempura.  We went at lunch time so we ordered from the lunch menu.  I don't know if the portions are the same as dinner time but I did not go away hungry.  It came with Miso soup (which I never had before so I don't know if it was a good Miso soup or a bad Miso soup but it was tasty.) It also came with a salad which I chose Ginger dressing for and it was good.  The main meal came with fried rice and steamed veggies.  Chicken was well seasoned and not dried out as some can get. All were good but I have to say I've had better fried rice.
The service was excellent, especially considering our group was about 30 people.  Food came out quickly for most (our table had a glitch but the server brought some cookies for us to munch on while we waited.  It wasn't any more than about 5 minutes after others were served.)  Servers are friendly and courteous.
Seeing some of the Tempura dishes that some of my fellow diners had, I will definitely be back to try those."}
{"text":"The place to go for happy hour! Food is pricy but delicious.  Very happy to have a place like this in Surprise"}
{"text":"The sushi bar chefs, Mike especially,are 
exceptional.  We have been to a few sushi bars aroun the Westside and honestly this is by far the best. They have a great selection of specials and will make you any kind of role, cut or hand, that you like.  Sadly the grill part of the food is not so good. We have had calamari, gyosa and a friend had a steak & shrimp plate.  They definiately over cook everything from the kitchen.  The cocktails are great and they have a wonderful selection for their every day happy hour. If you love sushi and sashimi I don't think you'll be disappointed with this place.  If you're more into the Teppan Grill type food, probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. A hidden gem in Surprise! The quality is better then any of the others in the area."}
{"text":"Have been twice now to sushi bar during the well-priced happy hour- which is pretty much all afternoon.  Good sushi, nice presentation, good service. I really like this place so much better than gross place that starts with an \"H\" across the street.  (That places smells like the bar is rotting and is terrible).  I'm not sure why they are not more busy here?  I think it's just a tough location being tucked away in that center.  It can be a bit loud because the sound bounces around in the cavernous space- so it feels more casual than intimate or romantic.  Definitely best in the area for sushi."}
{"text":"We have returned again for date night. Sat at the sushi bar and nothing but good things! The spicy crab roll was on point as well as the shrimp tempura roll. Our service couldn't have been more attentive to us if they tried! They kept our drinks full and cleared plates quickly. We will return soon!"}
{"text":"I haven't found better Japanese food in the West Valley.  Also, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  When they first opened (over a year ago), the prices were a little steep, but they've adapted the menu, and now the value is outstanding.  I am SO pleased that we have a good sushi restaurant nearby.  I go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"So I went here with my daughter for lunch. I could get sushi from Fry's that is better than this. The rolls fall apart, they don't even use sushi rice so rice went everywhere. I do not recommend the spicy tuna and shrimp rolls, they use some weird chili powder in it and doesn't taste that good. I paid about $2 more per roll than I would have at other locations for mediocre sushi, lesson learned I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Last night we introduced our daughter to sushi dining. We were seated without delay, and that was the only thing they did right last night. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  Two servers AND the manager walk past us several times, not one of them acknowledged our existence. After about 15 minutes we can hear the two servers discussing whose table we are. That tells me the place is unorganized!!.

When they finally acknowledge us we ordered our drinks, had already made our sushi selections and ordered garlic ademome. We can see the bar and watch the bartender very slowly make the drinks. After 20 minutes of the drink being ordered I walked up to the bar and grabbed the drink myself as our server never returned to the bar. I passed the manager and told him I grabbing it myself since our server does not want to do it. The managers was stone cold with no reaction. The ademome finally arrived after I grabbed the drink and it was a pile of mush, the worst tasting ademome I have ever tasted!
Once again, I told the manager how horrible the service was, he apologized and left. He eventually came back and said he would comp the drink and give a 20% discount.

We ordered 4 rolls and received all poorly placed on one plate and had to stop the server to get us some soy sauce boats due to not being placed on the table once we ordered sushi. The sushi rolls would fall apart as soon as we tried to dip them. I will say the only thing positive was the sushi did taste fresh.

Time to get our check, that was the fastest service of the night and when looking at the bill, the comp drink was still on the bill. When I confronted the server, she went to the manager and he tried to do a switch a roo on us and tried to comp us for our daughters (non alcohol) drink.

To summarize, unorganized, lack of acknowledgement, and unapologetic. I was hoping to find a sushi place close to home, but that is an epic fail and will continue to travel the distance to well established, previously visited establishments."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was surprised reading these reviews.  This place was a total disappointment.  

The atmosphere is anything but Japanese.  It looked like the decorator was confused.  Baseballs were on the wall.. There were Cheap and poorly placed decorations on the wall...

They did have happy hour items.  The sushi was small and not good at all.  We were very disappointed.  You get more flavor from the sushi at Frys.  

The calamari looked as if it came frozen and not made with fresh ingredients.  

If you want better sushi with better prices check out Nakama in Goodyear!  Now that is bomb.com sushi.

My advice is save your money because this place will have you questioning yourself why you came in.  

On the positive note:  the tempura happy hour item for $7 was not bad at all."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan. But my husband is, so we've tried this place a few times. He loved it...and I LOVED their veggies. This is odd because I'm not a veggie person generally, but their veggies are amazing. The katzu chicken was great too if you're looking for a non-sushi option.

The service was pretty quick and the waitresses were friendly. The only weird thing is that the restaurant is always really empty. We've gone for lunch and dinner. We were the only ones there at lunch and one of a few at dinner, so we hope they can stay open at this location."}
{"text":"fantastic......best sushi i've ever had

crazy good happy hour prices....9 pm to close.

$2.95 sushi rolls $ 3.95   sushi rolls

i will make this my once a week go to spot......

great servers  nice clean place...."}
{"text":"Great new find in Surprise UNI SUSHI.  Prices are reasonable and atmosphere is nice.  The Red Bull Roll is delicious as well as the Yellow Tail Box Roll.  Will definitely frequent this establishment.  The sushi chefs are friendly and interact with the patrons. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had dinner at Uni and it couldn't have gone better. She had chicken yakisoba and I had teriyaki beef and both exceeded our expectations. Uni features Sushi but that's not our thing so we ordered from the dinner menu.

Service was also very good. Eric, our server, was personable and efficient. Very nice. I have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! The food and service was amazing! Our server, Ethan, was extremely helpful and accommodating. Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I went there last night and loved it! The best salmon sashimi I have ever had. The rolls were delicious. My favorite is the poke roll. Definitely a place to go back to!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for the fist time this week. Excellent sushi and reasonable prices. Unfortunately our server was very new and had to ask the sushi chef for answers to our questions but this didn't negate the quality of our lunch."}
{"text":"my friend and i went for their happy hours, we ordered a few rolls, and we really love spicy tuna and Vegas roll. it was really tasty and yummy. i also really like their stuff, very friendly. my friend and i will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Would definitely return next time I am in the area! Sushi is amazing! Adorable bartender!"}
{"text":"Service never lets me down! This is my go to for sushi in the area. Staff is pleasant and food is awesome! Happy hour is a great perk as well!"}
{"text":"So the snow birds are history and we can get seats and service again. Living by Sun City has huge implications in the Fall and Winter. It's  difficult to find a place to eat and park. I hope that next year this restaurant will staff their shifts accordingly."}
{"text":"Meh! I would have rather gotten Sushi from Fry's. It wasn't terrible, but wasn't even close to great. Everything was well packaged, but tasted the same. New age tasteless rolls. The hibachi chicken was pretty bland as well, with over cooked rice.

Who gives Ranch and BBQ sauce with fried calamari? And $2.75, and the nerve to come out and tell us there are no refills on a small Apple Juice for an infant...really?

The last complaint, which bothered my wife (I didn't care), was the \"gangsta\" rap being played over the speakers...curses and all. So, I guess it's not really a \"family\" place. Glad we didn't bring out 6 year old.

I won't be back...but good luck!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best sushi restaurant in Surprise! The chefs and wait staff are the bomb! The manager will rock your world! Music is #good vibes"}
{"text":"This is our second visit. Food again was excellent,  service was superb! We will definitely be back and also tell all our friends that they should visit too.
Happy hour portions were much more than expected."}
{"text":"The sushi was decent. I went here for the first time last week and didn't appreciate the waitresses in short skirts giving off a sexy school girl vibe. You don't need to objectify young women to sell sushi. Not cool. I'll continue going to Fresh Wasabi around the corner for good sushi and service."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. I'm not sure what happened. Consistently terrible over the last month or so. We eat here at least once a week and will never eat here again. Honestly the list of things that are wrong with this place is too long to list. I could get the same quality of sushi/sashimi from the grocery store. Actually, I know the sushi from Fry's is better :/"}
{"text":"Finally a first class sushi restaurant in Surprise
Our second experience, with friends, reinforced our initial opinion, and our friends agreed.
The service, food preparation and presentation were excellent."}
{"text":"[DATE VISITED]: Wednesday October 22nd, 2014 for Dinner

[THE INTERIOR]: The place is very spacious, and I like how the tables aren't so close to each other. Looks like a good place to bring large groups of people. They have a large sushi bar with lots of chairs as well. My friend and I were seated promptly in their dining area.  

[THE FOOD]: My friend and I had a sashimi combo A, baked lobster roll and grilled teriyaki chicken. The sashimi is the freshest I've had in any sushi place in Phoenix. Props to the sushi chefs! Overall the quality of the food was pretty good, and the prices I'd say were fair and reasonable for what we got.   

[THE SERVICE]: It looks like they just recently opened, but service was still pretty good. I never felt like I was unattended. The owners and chefs are super friendly.  

[OVERALL EXPERIENCE]: Definitely a place I will comeback to try some of their other selections. I'd recommend coming here, and giving them a try. The sushi chefs, and manager/owners seemed to really care for the customers that were there, and I really enjoyed seeing that."}
{"text":"OMG this place is the best!!! Been here twice and both times top of the line in sushi, sashimi, service, consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend who had the unagi bowl which she thinks is the best available locally. I had a lunch combo of chicken Katsu and shrimp tempura roll. Lunch came with a salad, miso soup, rice and mixed tempura. Everything was very good and with a 20% off coupon, was extremely good value for money. What this place needs to learn is that people want to dine together. They have a tendency to serve piecemeal and when having a meal versus sushi to share, this is a problem. Server was attentive and followed up on drink refills."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We came in a had fantastic server, who was beyond thoughtful, knowledgable and not pushy. Nice open concept and well lit. The extensive menu selection fit the restaurant and sushi bar looked amazing. The sushi itself was fantastic and fresh. The rolls were generous portions and well put together. My wife and I really enjoyed our food!!! Great touch on the cooking. Some places try to overpower you with flavor, Uni sets itself apart by letting the food do the talking and gives a measured touch flavor to enhance. We will be back and recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much obsessed. Love the daily happy hour too! Totally couldn't find that in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Sushi was delish! We had Palm Springs roll & Oh Boy roll. Both were fresh & flavorful. So close to my house too!!"}
{"text":"The sushi and steaks here are great!
Carry was a great server and our service was speedy!
The food came quickly and was just as we ordered."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in the West Valley. I highly recommend!! My daughter lives in San Francisco so I'm used to really good sushi. This is the BEST I've had in Arizona!! 

They're new, give them a try....we want to keep good businesses in Surprise!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The sushi was some of the best I've ever had...service was excellent, place was very clean. 
A great find in Surprise, can't wait to go back with my friends"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I recently took my wife here for the first time and we were blown away.  The staff is friendly, prices were incredibly fair, and the sushi was well made and delicious.  The lychee sake was our favorite sake to date.  We had fickle different rolls and found each one to be delicious.  We will be back soon for another dinner.  Also, their happy hour deals are unbeatable along with the fact that happy hour runs all evening daily.  

Well done!"}
{"text":"Great service and sushi was good! Will be going back to their sushi happy hour. Location is great too, not in the middle of all the chaos!"}
{"text":"Terrible service/totally understaffed.  Our waitress never asked us if we needed drink refills.  Waited over 20 minutes for a second round of rolls- just cucumber rolls. By the time they came, I had already fed our hungry children a snack from my purse. Left hungry, unimpressed, and shocked by \"happy hour\" prices. Way too expensive for experience."}
{"text":"Great service, environment and sushi ! Their happy hour is from 3pm-close everyday. Great value on top of a great place :) will come again with friends !"}
{"text":"Just opened so have some growing pains, but at the end of the day it is about the sushi and quality of fish and they do it well.  We've been twice and not had a bad bite.  Once the snowbirds come to town..they will be packed.  Worth giving a try,and they have 10% coupons in most west side papers."}
{"text":"This gets two stars because the food was decent and reasonably priced.  However, that is where the positive ends.  I have no idea how UNI finds such spectacular staff members, but do the exact OPPOSITE of them and you will already be miles ahead.  First the hostess seats 6 of us in a tiny booth in the corner.  Putting tables together was not an option.  Second, we had 3 kids with us.  No forks were put on the table, only chopsticks.  We had to request three times to get the \"cheater\" device for the chopsticks.  Third, because we had such a small table, when all the food started coming out there wasn't enough room to place it on.  We had some soup bowls that were finished that could have been removed prior but instead they just stared at us like \"do something customer, this plate is hot\", so I had to put on my bus boy hat and move the dishes for them.  Fourth, and by far the ultimate knee slapper...the waiter is refilling my wife's drink and accidentally spills water all over the table and onto our Golden California roll.  He then walks off.  I assume it's to get a rag to wipe up the mess BUT he never comes back for 10 minutes.  We are sitting there laughing just waiting for the camera crew to appear with a \"gotcha suckers\" but sadly they never showed up.  Later when he brings the bill my wife gently tells him that water was spilled all over our food and it was soggy and no longer appealing to eat (just trying to get a simple apology).  The waiter says \"Soooooo you're blaming me for spilling the water.\" Umm yeah dude we are.  He then offers to replace the roll \"if we want, but if not that's cool too\", but craftily finds a way to stop just short of actually apologizing.  We will never come back *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have tasted in a while, absolutely delicious 
I always order food from here"}
{"text":"Yikes, love the local place... But tonight was horrible. Slow service, wrong food delivered, drinks delivered 20 minutes after being ordered, second sushi dish delivered 30 minutes after being ordered. Asked for check 10 minutes ago and still waiting. Get your act together!!!"}
{"text":"Their ramen was delicious and try their ice cream it comes in a super fancy cup."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous service at this place! Ordered sushi to go. Told the person we would be at the bar waiting for our food. The bartender and two other employees completely ignored us! I'm not sitting at the bar for nothing! I'd like to order drinks - and you don't have to put your mind reading hat on for that - geez!!! Not only that, but the manager who was watching TV behind us, and walked by us multiple times nothing! Left without food. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food. All the food was so fresh. They have happy hour everyday from 4-close. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing lunch. Jeremy was our server with impecable timing and very nice personality. The food is delicious. The salad with the sesame dressing is the best. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome from the time we walked in. Staff very nice, respectful and friendly. Food was good too. Enjoyed dinner with family."}
{"text":"We love fish. We eat it probably 3-4 times a week. So I'll start by saying all I really care about is the quality of the sashimi. We ordered the sashimi combination box and it was 30$. Which is fine if the food is good.... but it was truly disgusting. Not all the wasabi and soy in the world to save it from itself. The service was very friendly and quick. I hate leaving nasty reviews but the prices just did not match the quality of the food. 14$ for the poke roll! It was basically just a California roll with tuna on top. It was gross! Too much mayo! WE WILL NOT COME BACK. SAVE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"Good service and very fresh, tasty food. Looking forward to going back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Surprised on how good it was for the fist time. Sushi was very tasty and plentiful. They have soju here which I was excited and it was a good brand.. It's really a diamond in the rough and didn't expect something this good out here in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Service is awesome food is great. Can't ask for much more. Try the firecracker and garlic edamame to start with. You will be very happy"}
{"text":"Great service, and food. Loved the apple souju! Awesome happy he is from 3pm to close!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Our waiter was Erik and he claimed to be fairly new but we couldn't tell. He was fast and efficient. Really happy we found this hidden gem! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Some of the better sushi in the area, though not quite the best.  Their rolls and nigiri are all good, and we used some of their non-sushi selections for kids who weren't in the mood for fish.  The staff is super nice and very good at what they do.  The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is just that I like to find something really unique and exciting and awesome when I go for sushi, and they had pretty much the same thing you can find everywhere else.  It was all great, but they didn't have anything that had that extra unique flair that I love to find at different sushi spots.  If I'm way out in Surprise, this will be my spot for sushi, but if I'm a bit further east, I won't make the trip just to get to Uni."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go out to BWW- but saw this place on the sign at the entry, so we decided to give it a shot (after checking yelp for reviews!)
It was pretty good! We started with Vegas rolls- they were ok- not the best I've ever had- but good and on happy hour pricing too! The Miso was really good- mostly the broth, very little tofu and green onion hunks in it, but still the full flavor. 
I prefer my friend rice to not have veggie in it- I ordered it that way and they must have forgot. My husbands food came out and I was still waiting for another 5 minutes while they remade my rice. =( 
Everything was cooked well, seasoned well and tasted great. Glad to find this spot because the Steak and sushi place across the street sucks!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the service, its suuuuper slow and they aren't even busy. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Sushi and came across this place in Surprise. Was seated quickly and our server Sean was very prompt. He gave us a couple good suggestions on top of what we had already chose and all in all was a good amount of food. The garlic edamame was a little to done but was still flavorful. We did enjoy the golden avocado as well as the vegas roll. Prices were great and enjoyed there happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I feel like Uni is one of the best kept secret sushi spots in Surprise.  It's almost never busy, which is surprising because the food is to die for!  We're lucky to have Ginny as our server 90% of the time.  She's always fast, efficient, and friendly.  And did I mention the food is to die for?  Plus they have a killer happy hour."}
{"text":"Friendly service, and delicious food. I'm not big on raw fish but I don't have to worry about that because I absolutely love the fried rolls! Oh boy roll is my favorite of them all! Also the tempura items on the menu are quite tasty!! Not only do they have great food.. but they have some awesome desserts! Fried cheesecake and Mochi ice cream ?? Yum!!"}
{"text":"Good food, and the waiter was very friendly and fun. Once we finally started getting served things went well. Reason for 3 stars...
1.Hostess looked unhappy with being at work and like it pained her to seat people. The hostess is the first representation of your establishment, they should be the bubbliest (not ditsy), most joyful employees and let's face it, the responsibilities are not demanding. Stand there, greet, seat, and be happy gosh you bummed me out girl! 
2. It took forever to get service and order anything.
- 2 Stars.
I would still go there again and hope for better service because the food was very good."}
{"text":"The salmon was fresh and the broth is amazing. The tempora was nice and crisp. And the waiter was sweet!"}
{"text":"Kicking myself in the butt for not taking a pic because this is too ridiculous to even make up. We ordered the Poke Roll and there literally was rainbow sprinkles on top, like the Wilton  Nonpareils that you would expect to see on a cupcake. No idea what they were thinking and this was not on the menu as an ingredient. It did not mesh well with the excessive mayo taste of the roll (turns out sprinkles do not make everything taste better). Also as a tea fanatic when I order a ice green tea from a Japanese restaurant I am expecting a few brew or a matcha mix - they served us a sweetened Lipton green citrus. Bad service, bad quality and over priced for what you receive (and I have no problem dropping $100 for some good sushi)."}
{"text":"As a regular sushi eater and a customer of this establishment I have yet to be disappointed.  I tend to go during their happy hour which is hard to miss considering it is every day from 3pm to close.  I also tend to avoid rush hours so it is never busy when I am in there (don't think I've ever seen it full).

As you walk in you are greeted by the hostess with a smile, it has an open floor plan and definitely has the atmosphere of a local (bigger than a) hole-in-the-wall joint.  Over to the right is the alcohol bar, with brightly colored lights changing colors as it lights up the alcohol bottles, a little tacky but honestly I kind of like the vibe of them trying to be a \"hip\" sushi spot. I usually go straight to the sushi bar where you have the two sushi chefs out in front of you, chopping up fish and hand crafting every roll to order. 

Sitting at the sushi bar they will almost immediately hand you a cucumber dish (for free) with sauce drizzled on it. For starters, I hate cucumbers, don't know what it is I just cannot eat them, but I almost want to ask for more of these cucumbers every time I receive this tasty treat. Bomb. The server tends to come up within a reasonable time asking if you want drinks, miso soup (also free, also bomb), or anything from the kitchen. The service is usually good considering I do not come during peak hours so the servers are never busy. They tend to come up 3-4 times during the meal to make sure we are well.  Personally, I stick with the good stuff, sushi rolls. I tend to start with a California (or if I'm feeling like a little fried food the \"Golden California\"), move to a spicy crab or spicy tuna, next the Philly, and almost always end with the Vegas roll. All decent size and fresh. All of that and a beer tends still fall around or under $20. All the prices on happy hour are pretty unbeatable. Unless you crush 15 rolls, then go find your AYCE sushi spot elsewhere.

Growing up next to the beach and having access to great sushi, I haven't been disappointed by Uni. That is why I am giving this middle of the desert spot the rounded-up portion of my 3.5-star review. I can't say that they are better than any of my nostalgic sushi spots back home, but they definitely do a good job here.  If you are new to sushi, or you are trying to find a good cheap spot, you should definitely try this place out.  Does not smell fishy (which I stress to avoid any sushi spot that smells like fish or covers every roll in a sauce), servers tend to always have a smile on their faces, the ambiance is calm, the beer is always cold, and the sake is hot. Perfect spot for a little date night."}
{"text":"Really great service and the food was awesome! Seriously addicted to the garlic edamame. So so good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, atmosphere, service and price.  Our family has eaten at Uni Sushi since it first opened and it's a family favorite.  We always get something we like even when we try something new. They have a great happy hour. The sushi doesn't get any better than this in Surprise, AZ.  We're addicted to this place and everyone we've recommended it to also loves it!"}
{"text":"Nothing will ever be as good as the food in Japan but Uni makes a heroic, Americanized attempt. Food is good, staff is kind though there seems to be a high turnover rate. We come here a few times per month"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. If you want somewhere with good sushi and good hibachi good, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"My wife and I love going for teppanyaki, we thought this place had table side grills, it does not, however, the food and service here are top notch!! Each time we have either gone here, or gotten takeout, the staff has always been very attentive, and on too of their game. It is set back off of the street so not many people know about it. I highly recommend this place, it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We recently tried this place out. Great food! Great service! Great prices! We were happy to find that Happy Hour runs daily from 3-close. We ordered the egg rolls, firecracker, spicy tuna and golden California roll. All were absolutely delicious. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good size portions. Very nice and attentive  friendly service. Food comes fresh and fast. Nice laid back feel. Happy hour from 3pm till close. The complimentary slices of cucumber with sesame seeds and some brown sweet sauce was surprisingly really good. Misu soup is on point."}
{"text":"Came back to tryout the chicken Katsu again. Still as flavorless as ever. But everything else is good."}
{"text":"Yummy california rolls! a nice crunch on the outside and delicious inside. The rice dishes were good and the sushi got high marks from my companion."}
{"text":"We tried Uni since we had a coupon.  We were very happy with the food! My husband had a Long Island Icetea and said it was tart and wonderful.  
We ordered appetizers - Poke tuna and avocado boats - both excellent! 
I ordered for dinner the beef teriyaki and tempura shrimp & veggies.  They came with fresh vegetables also and I loved the seasoning. All was wonderful. The only kink was that my husband's dinner came about 20 minutes later.   His sushi/ sashimi combo platter was very fresh and tasty! We will be back - Can't wait to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"Uni for the price level is great. It's not fancy Scottsdale sushi but it's very well prepared, great variety and combinations.  I've been here twice and the service is good, is a big area which makes it feel empty, but again it's not high end. Compared to other sushi restaurants, in the NW area it's an excellent option."}
{"text":"I write this review in extreme protest since I loth sushi, with that being said every single one of my friends loves this place and whenever we all go out and someone says \"sushi\" this is where we end up. I of course find something to my liking and that is always delicious so that is a plus.
I should explain that I do not like sushi because I have a shellfish allergy and without fail I walk into a sushi restaurant and end up with some sort of rash from cross contamination. Unit is the only sushi place this has not happened and just about the only place I trust for it not to happen, hence the five star rating."}
{"text":"The decor was not as nice as the photos. The booths and seats did not match the decor and the music didn't really fit. The sushi was pretty good, but my date disagreed. I really enjoyed the drinks though! The seats could use an update/fixing."}
{"text":"First time here.  The service is very good and the waiter attentive. Food is fresh and the portion is ample. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The food and sushi was excellent. Awesome service! My waitress, Carmen was super friendly and fast. I would definitely come back when I'm visiting the area again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Uni's.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean.  The original order from the Sushi selection form was lost so we were asked to complete another one.   A number of items were ordered for the four of us and the food was fair.  The order was mixed up though and food we didn't order was presented to us and other items we did order never showed up.  One meal in particular (a sushi/sashimi combo) took an hour to arrive.  The Manager was apologetic and removed that meal from the bill.  I'll give them one more try and I hope they get their act together"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!  Everything is so yummy from the sushi to the fried rice and steak!  Every time we go it gets better!  All of the staff is amazing!   Ambiance is great and can't beat the happy hour!  Our new favorite place!  Surprise is lucky to have it :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and top notch service!  I have known the owner Honda for many years.  And when I first met him he was managing a Teppanyaki restaurant.  I always used to tell him he needed his own thing because he was too darn good to be working for anyone else.  And now here we are many years later and UNI he was born.  By Nature Honda has a touch for creating great food at a fair price.  Once a former Teppanyaki Chef himself who better than to have a restaurant then a man who has been on the frontlines cooking himself?  So if you're in surprise be in for a surprise if you choose to go eat at Uni; it is world famous in my view!   
Cheers,
Will James."}
{"text":"Weirdly Good ! First time there with family tonight. Food was very good service was adequate. The reason I say weirdly good is this. The place has been several restaurants over the years and all of them have the place configured weird. It just feels off when you walk in the place. It was a Roadhouse at first then The music man and now Uni, it just is a weird layout. Otherwise everything was good."}
{"text":"They just opened a week go in surprise, me and my friend went and tried habachi combo and some rolls. Everythings fresh and yum. High recommend for this place."}
{"text":"Uni's food is great. Mike is the best chef, he prepares our food to perfection. It's nice to have a sushi restaurant close to home. Highly recommend the garlic edamame and the happy hour menu is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the spot! Best happy hour ever! Never too busy and food and drinks always come so fast! Sushi is great too!"}
{"text":"First time here and I don't know why I waited so long. The happy hour menu is awesome and it's 3 pm to close every day! I'll be coming back here often."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good. Great presentation. Music ??? Not sure why they choices it after all this is Japanese restaurant.  Prices I felt were $$$ not $$ I would come back  though because Sushi was fresh and good."}
{"text":"I recently moved back here with my family after 2.5 years away in California. I used to really like Uni when it first opened up. Sure, they had some bumps a long the way but that is expected for a new restaurant during the first couple of weeks. The food was always on point and of high quality. My issue now is after going back a few times I feel like they have let the quality of their sushi slip. I'm not going to judge the other food because I haven't had it yet but my daughters teriyaki chicken kids meal was on point. I ordered my favorite roll the other day the tuna tataki roll and was eager to eat it but when I received it it was not the roll I remembered... instead it was very bland with what appeared to be store bought fried onions on top and some weird dressing. When I used to get it it had real crispy fried onions that they made in house... the sushi at frys grocery store looked better and more appetizing then my roll... for 14 dollars I was expecting way better. This roll was worth about 10 because of the actual Tuna on top.

Service has been great can't complain about that. That roll really bummed me out and I don't think I will be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Place was really busy tonight. We enjoyed our dinner and the service was average but will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is sad and disgusting!!! I went there because on google it's the \"Top 10 best restaurant\" but in reality it's the \"Top 10 WORST restaurant\" ! I'm never going there again. They should just go out of business."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience with a Groupon. It is not reflective of the food. 

The Groupon was worth $30, but only $27 was taken off the bill. When I questioned the server, she went to her manager for an explanation. She returned and stated the difference is the tax on the $30. What??? I've used many Groupons as well as other deals and have never had this happen. Make no mistake...The $3 does not break my bank. I paid the bill without giving them the fight I would have given if my kids weren't with me, but I did deduct $3 from the tip. I also contacted Groupon and based on their customer service I expect they will resolve this matter for me. 

It's s shame because the food was pretty good but I will never go back to Uni again."}
{"text":"I've gone twice now, once for dinner, and once for lunch.  

For the dinner I got the Sashimi salad and it was good.  A fair amount of fish on the salad and overall tasty.  I got it with a bowl of miso soup which was also good.  Food came out fresh, although both meals not at the same time.  There were a few minutes between plates.  Servers friendly and attentive.  

For the lunch the place was pretty empty, 3 tables.  The server seemed pretty new and we had to point to the items on the menu for her to write it down.  Both ordered a meat with the tempura.  I had teriyaki salmon which was very tasty and the tempura was excellent.  But way too much food.  I had a nice amount to snack on the rest of the day and for a light dinner.  My recommendation, make the lunch portions smaller, drop the price a few $$ and then you'd have a great lunch deal.  The current lunch is just  a bit cheaper than the dinner. Not as much of a deal, and too much food.  

Overall, tasty. I'm not a sushi snob, but what I had was tasty, the fish tasted fresh, and the servers are nice.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Really great place to grab sushi. Late night runs here are pretty often with my fiancé. They are usually very quick to get the food up to you. They did get rid of my fiancés favorite dish but that's okay. The environment is usually pretty quiet, the hostess seems to not like her job to much. Other than that the food is great the servers are always nice. Never have a problem when we come here. We are somewhat new to surprise so we are checking out some other places in the future."}
{"text":"I like their food. Service can be spotty but ok. You get a lot of food for the money but I don't think that there are any Japanese people working there, and that is a shame"}
{"text":"California rolls were fire like it always is here.
The food is so good here that I would eat it.
That server Kayla tho #DamnSon"}
{"text":"Always great! This is one of our favorite places to eat. The service is fantastic and the food is even better. If your in the west valley you must stop at Uni."}
{"text":"Just left and have to say I was so disappointed.  This was my third visit and order the Vegas Roll, and  Lobster Roll which was not at all like I had before.  My husband order the chicken habachi which had no flavor.  Our server Kaylee was amazing, it was her first night.  She had to apologize to us because the habachi came out way after the sushi.   Told us they were down one cook.  At that time my daughter ask to speak to the manager.  He came over listen, went in the kitchen and came out with the plate.  If you are short a cook, why as the manager aren't you in that kitchen helping out instead of sitting at the bar in deep conversation. So overall the food was not good and to make things worst they still had Christmas music on."}
{"text":"First time here! Everything was amazing. The service is as also on point. I highly recommend the Jalapeño Poppers and all the sushi was delish.

*Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"This restaurants food was well prepared, and fresh.  We had a group of 20, so one table at a time was served.  The fresh Sushi California Roll and  lollipop lobster were outstanding and  were prepared in front of us so you know it was freshly prepared.  Several in our party had Tempura  while others had Teriyaki and all were delivered in a timely manner.  The staff was friendly and able to make suggestions."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, price is affordable, service is friendly and happy hour menu is awesome."}
{"text":"Food was decent, nothing out of the world, better than Hayashi, i will def make this my place to go for Sushi in surprise. Service was really good, my soda was flat, politely let the waitress know, she offered free drinks for the rest of the day, throughout the meal she was helpful and attentive, brought up a billing error and that was quickly rectified, my gf and I will be back soon for some good food :).  Also if you give a place 1 star because of 3 dollars... really.. go back to 4chan,"}
{"text":"Excellent food! It was a little cold but, I'll be back...I love their sushi rolls! The korean waitress was very kind, and made sure we were helped, and the food is so genuine and very good indeed! :) mmm, see you soon guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. Was expecting this place to be awesome.  
Every kitchen food item that we ordered,  the food was cold.  It seemed like the food was pre-cooked and the just heated it up but it didn't help.  
  
Garlic Edamame:  Overcooked and slightly burned
Sweet and Spicy Chicken Wings:  Pre-cooked and was heated up in the microwave and splashed with sweet chili sauce. 

Palm Springs Roll: Fairly good

Chicken and Steak Hibachi: comes with friends rice and vegetables. Vegetables were good but cold. Chicken was tough and again pre-00cooked and heated up. The steak was as tough as steak you had as leftovers from 2 weeks ago. 

Lunch Pork Bulgogi combo.  Got the vegas roll with the combo. Roll was leftover from the day before. Bulgogi was good but again... pre-cooked and was cold. 

Our server was clearly not a server. She was nice but shouldn't be a server. She was wearing open toe wedge sandals. She was walking so slow and we couldn't figure out if it was just her or because of her shoes or maybe both.  Both her and the other female server disappeared for over 15 minutes.  

They need professional servers. 

Considering that I knew where one of the sushi chef came from, I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I went when it first opened and I wasn't impressed with their specialty rolls.  It was in the wintertime too, so they had their heater blasting...so we were burning up.  We actually had to ask them to turn it down...funny though, because I was thinking of how the scantily clad waitresses were probably freezing.  Ha!

Our favorite roll out of the few we ordered was the unique Honda Roll, which had super thin slices of lime on top.  It added a really nice little flavor flare to the roll, which would have actually lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Very pleased with our first visit. Portions were pretty big--like the Hibachi dishes were enough to share--and the service was excellent. I was surprised that the child's size beef teriyaki came with miso soup as well as a small salad, rice, tempura veggies AND the beef teriyaki. It was a sizeable portion for $7. I appreciated the Happy Hour pricing being extended. The Gyoza was good. Im not used to it being fried rather its usually steamed but it was good. The egg rolls were tasty. Not as good as Saigon Kitchen but its hard to top those. I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place. Going to a sushi joint, you always have to be prepared to pay through the nose but here the price simply wasn't worth it. Two and a half people, lunch, $65.10 - and that wasn't including the tip. The food wasn't all that great (RA Sushi in Old Town or Tokyo Lobby in Glendale are far better), but the prices here are just nuts. $12 for a rainbow roll - really? (Tokyo Lobby have them for $10). Even the nigiris are a half buck or more over what they should be charging. $5 for two small pieces of fish and let's face it, 80% of the damn thing is plain boiled rice. They even nickel and dimed us an extra dollar just because we switched one roll to soy paper from seaweed. And a tiny cup of green tea was $2.75.

Definitely not coming back, I'm afraid. I'd rather make the trip to Tokyo Lobby (which IS the best sushi in the West Valley IMO) where the food tastes better and the prices are more reasonable. I guarantee Uni won't survive in Surprise, not with prices like this and especially not in the cattycorner location they moved into, site of at least four or five other local restaurant failures."}
{"text":"The hostess said they were understaffed tonight but our service did that reflect that. We had a great waitress who was tentative and made a real strong Mai Tai! We ordered 3 sushi rolls and each were so good. I highly recommend this place. Great service. Great sushi. Great drinks."}
{"text":"So the truth is that I was not impressed at all.  The service was poor but in truth that seemed to be an issue with staffing not the quality of the staff.  There were two women working the entire place pretty much all by themselves which was far too few for the number of tables and people present.  There were other people wandering around doing other things but not waiting tables.  It was over 10 minutes from the time I sat down to when the poor waitress was able to get over to me to greet me and take a drink order.  It was not that she was just screwing around though, she was working her tail off.  She had great attitude and was apologetic for the delay.  There was also an additional dely in the food coming out which again appeared to be a matter of staffing.  I do not take management screw ups out on staff.

The sushi was not cheap and over priced for the size of the pieces.  These were baby sized pieces of sushi.  I ordered the 8 piece assorted sushi and frankly assorted sushi to me means assorted not two pieces of salmon, tuna, snapper and shrimp.  Now the fish tasted great but for $25.00 I expected an assortment, meaning 8 different pieces.  The Dragon Roll was good although the sauce on it was quite watery compared to any other sushi place I have been to. At least the size of the roll was standard although the price was couple dollar more than I am used to paying for the same order.  And frankly $2.75 for a mug of tea is outrageous.  Hot water and a two cents worth of tea leaves does not equal $2.75.

The decor looked like something but I am not sure what.  I never was here prior to whatever was here before this place but the decor looked more like someone had had some sort of roadhouse theme or something prior and they just kept it.  Truthfully I so not think I will be returning.  The truth is that while the waitress was a nice person she had far too many tables to attend to and this is unfair to her and the customers.  The flavors were quite good but the size of the sushi pieces was small and the assortment was not an assortment.  For the price they are charging I would expect better and frankly if you are going to charge 2.75 for hot tea, serve a small pot not a single cup."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for the past two years for my birthday dinner. Service is always excellent and regardless of it is busy or not, the waiters and waitresses have a complete awareness of how to serve their customers. Drinks and food are always served promptly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Excellent sushi in a fantastic setting. The service is hit or miss but I always feel welcome and comfortable. The menu contains a decent variety of options and the chefs plate every dish beautifully. There is also a full bar serving so many different brands, including the Japanese brands i love so much. I dont have enough supurlatives for this establishment. (More attentive servers would have earned 5 stars)."}
{"text":"Sushi was great! This was the first sushi place I've eaten here since moving to Surprise. I'd definitely come back to get my sushi fix. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"this place is a gem. Happy hour is all night everyday and very cheap. Sushi is excellent. Cheapest drink prices anywhere. Last time ordered 2 sushi rolls, appetizer, draft beer and saki bomber all for under $30."}
{"text":"Shiawasena Jikan!

Have been here three times and every visit has been great! Our last time here, we just stopped in for happy hour and appetizers. There were three of us each having a couple drinks and filled ourselves with a variety of delicious appetizers. Paid less than $40 for three of us! Happy hour goes from 3 pm to closing, 7 days a week!."}
{"text":"Great deals after 3pm- they are way under staffed in the foh though and service suffers greatly.

Sushi is not best but I am rooting for his place to do well."}
{"text":"My go-to place for sushi in the area.  I am a regular at the restaurant, and notice that when one particular chef is there, the sushi is very very good.  On other days, it is not as good.  I typically order the Dynamite Roll, Shrimp Tempura, and Inari roll.  The service has always been really good---I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great happy hour, great service!! What more is there to say?!? Jeremy is the best!! If I could give him 5 stars I would !"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. Food outstanding as usual. Had spicy pork Bulgogi. Not too spicy, nice little burn with extra sauce on the side that is just fantastic. Used it up. Came with a grilled variety of veggies that were so flavorful. Also came with rice, and miso soup and a salad (with the ginger dressing) to start out. My wife had crunchy California rolls with eel sauce and avocado rolls. She declared them delicious. My elderly aunt had the shrimp and veggie tempura and polished it off. She said her food was outstanding as well. I have never been disappointed by the food here. In fact, their non-sushi menu items (not a big sushi fan) are some of the very best I've had at various Japanese restaurants in the valley. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"The chefs were very nice.  Our waiter was friendly & knowledgeable.  I would have liked our area bussed more but that would have been my biggest complaint.  All in all no biggie.  That Red Bull roll should be tested for illegal substances bc that is addictive!
Thank you for the great local sushi joint with service to match.
My husband approved of the short skirts on the waitresses.  We didn't drink but I can imagine hanging out in their bar area with friends.

P.S. I feel the prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Came in to sample some local sushi, ordered several different types and found them to be just ok; not as flavorful as I've had elsewhere so I was slightly disappointed but the service was excellent and the price was reasonable. Also the menu has more to offer than just sushi so I'm definitely going to return and try something else."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The servers are really nice and do a good job checking on you and keeping your drink full. They are pretty fast with bringing your food once you order. We have eaten here twice now and are excited to go again."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had since I left Korea and there's two years of Europe after there. Also cheap."}
{"text":"Excellent place and they give you 20% off with movie ticket stubs from digiplex... well worth it..if you want to try a new place you can't go wrong here.  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed an amazing dinner here! We are from San Diego area, so trying a new sushi place we were a little hesitated, also it was Valentines evening and neither of us wanted to cook, so after some Yelp reviews and called to see if there was a wait (there wasn't at 8pm) we arrived. Our serve Erik was awesome! He has great suggestions and excellent customer service! Now for the sushi! One word.....AMAZING! My husband and and I were almost in a shock how in Arizona this restaurant was making top line sushi! In all we had quiet the spread for 2 people, two miso soups, two appetizers( firecracker and gyoza) follow with our first two rolls Vegas Roll and Shrimp Tempera, we loved everything we were eating, so we ordered more! We went with Erik's suggestion on the RedBull Roll (amazing!) and the Golden Californian. So much delicious food for 2 people. To end this amazing dinner course we completed with green tea ice cream that the presentation again surprised us! So much detail into every roll and dish! This is definitely a go to place for authentic top line sushi! (did I mention my husband has traveled to Tokyo) and he was pretty impressed with everything! We are looking forward to our next visit and can't wait to explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Offers steaks, noodle dishes, teriyaki chicken and other cooked dishes, if sushi is not your thing. We tried all sorts of menu items and we're happy with them all. Our waitress was very friendly. The restaurant was so clean I would eat off the floor....almost. Don't be alarmed that it is located in a shopping center."}
{"text":"This was a while ago but I live very far from my favorite sushi spot and my parents and I both wanted sushi and they had tried this place before and wanted me to go with. The first thing I noticed was that it was super busy. So that must mean that this place was really good. Well for how busy it was, we actually had really good service. I really liked our waitress. She had to of been around my age. Her name was Katie. She was super sweet and very attentive to every single table. As far as the food goes, it was about average. It was good tasting but I'd like to see more of a variety on the menu or special sushi rolls. I would like to go back again though and try some more. The service definitely gets an A and definitely gave me a good impression of this place. Maybe next time I can try an. Appetizer or dessert. We'll see!!"}
{"text":"Had the firecracker appetizer and Katsu chicken with fried rice and a sake/asahi bomber. Food and service were excellent. I do have two complaints I hope management will read: the jalapeño I had with my firecracker was so mild my children would have eaten it and liked it too. Firecracker implied some spice and I was disappointed in that dud. Also I would like to state that $5 is way too much money to substitute fried rice for the white rice my katsu came with originally. While it was good fried rice I feel that substitution price deserves a second look."}
{"text":"NO Steak!

Went to Uni Sushi and Steak for Steak, however no steak, it has been taken off the menu."}
{"text":"Great food & awesome service!! Extremely pleased with the quality of sushi.  Great atmosphere and perfect location for us who live in Wickenburg."}
{"text":"Hello we had a  nice time the server Rachael was wonderful she was happy and very helpful too I had California roll and check out there happy hour  selection too loot to chose from and if you get the calamari and it looks like onion rings it's not if you do get  server as we did once again Rachael she very friendly it makes it nice"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it's still just OK. I've gone to some really nice sushi spots so this is decent for the price. 

Three stars because I had the spicy, pork bulgogi last night and it was horrible. I've ordered this dish a few times and this time the meat tasted a bit off/bad. It was removed from the bill but something wasn't right about thy meat.

Amazing daily happy hour from 3-close with some tasty items!"}
{"text":"We love Uni! Their happy hour is unbeatable for the amazing sushi and other items they offer! The staff is nice and food is always as ordered and fresh!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. Had teriyaki chicken tuna rolls tempura and Japanese vegetables. Everything was delicious perfectly prepared and presented. Amounts were ample and prices/value excellent"}
{"text":"Moving  from Los Angeles to Surprise... We hoped there would be a good Japanese  and or Korean place to go to. Well we found Uni last night and it was a really solid find. Quality fish, tempura was light, fresh and overall whole experience was really good. Something we didnt expect....  A Korean side of the menu that we for sure will dive into on our next visit.    Mike was great and so were the servers.  Bonus here is a full bar and TVs so I can watch Hockey... whats not to like!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke now! \"It's against our policy to do kids meals to go\" they set up a business in a suburban family community and won't sell paying customers that have kids and don't want to dine in a kids meal. The excuse we got \"too many adults order them for themselves\" my response who gives a shite they still paid you for it! This place doesn't deserve my business anymore.  The food and service has gone way down hill anyways! Avoid them and their \"policies\"!"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to try sushi in AZ after moving here from Vegas a few months back, but I had a friend who lives in Surprise take me to lunch and I'm glad he did. The service is friendly and prompt, the food is made fresh and the prices are great. I was so impressed by this place that a month later I took him there for lunch. My favorite thing on the menu is the Golden Avacodo... if you like avacodo this is a MUST have! The lunch combos are such a good deal and you get so much for your money. I will definitely be returning every chance I get."}
{"text":"Everything tasted the same....very disappointed with the food. Only thing we liked was the fire cracker for appetizer. Sushi on happy hour was not good. Service was fine."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good happy hour deals on beer and sushi. The draft beer tastes a little odd but the sushi is a good value. Great service!"}
{"text":"Great service! Love the cucumber salad they give you when you sit at sushi bar. Great happy hour choices!"}
{"text":"The sushi was really good and the white peach sake is awesome! Go for reverse happy hour to get the best prices"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok but the service was horrible. The place is understaffed. The service was slow and really not worth returning."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I always try different things and they seem to amaze me every time. The hostess' are young students that will greet you kindly at the door. The servers are attentive and are professional. The chefs are awesome and makes amazing food. Looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment and were impressed with the food and service.  Great Happy hour with a good selection of reduced priced items.  We started with appetizers of Garlic Edamame and the Fire Cracker (fried Jalapeno, spicy tuna, and cream cheese).  Then ordered a Sake Bomber along with Scallop Dynamite and a Shrimp Tempura roll.  
All of the food items we ordered were very good.  Service was adequate. We will definitely return and try some dinner combinations and specialty rolls next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and even better food!!! Will definitely continue to come here regulatly"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and good happy hour deals. Servers sometimes are shaky but the chefs are great!"}
{"text":"Great California Rolls. Wonderful teriyaki chicken with fresh vegetables.  Great service. Clean and friendly. Lots if good flavors."}
{"text":"Great local spot with good prices and food. The service was a bit slow though for not being a busy night."}
{"text":"Not bad, came here because Suma was closed. I didnt think it was as good for the higher dollar amount. The avocado roll was good but only 6 pieces which would normally be 8 or 12 for 6 bucks, the Vegas roll had too much breading. Sake bombs were just fine but the were $6 instead of the $5 happy hour special that Suma does. We did not try teppenyaki."}
{"text":"Fun place to meet friends for happy hour. Happy hour menu is good - pick several items and share  with the table.  Been here several times in the past couple months with both six plus people to two people and each time have been served quickly and the waitress have been friendly each time."}
{"text":"This is not your quiet little tucked-in-a-corner sushi bar with koto music playing the the background.  It is a large place with a high ceiling ... looks like a sports bar design ... several TV screens.  There is a sushi bar plus a drinks bar plus lots of tables, so they can accommodate many customers.  Waiters were friendly and food came fairly quickly.  Gyoza were hot and crispy.  Hubby almost always orders sashimi but this night he thought the teriyaki salmon sounded good and it was.  Perfectly cooked, with just a light teriyaki sauce.  Came with stir-fried veggies and rice.  I enjoyed my tempura and spicy tuna roll.  Japanese beer selection.  I had hot sake.  I really can't think of any reason to downgrade the rating."}
{"text":"Great food! Great people! 
I've been to Uni for lunch, happy hour and for dinner as well! (not on the same day) LOL
The teriyaki chicken lunch is the best $12 lunch I've ever had, anywhere!
The Happy Hour menu is fantastic!
The sushi is very fresh & tasty (go with the Honda Roll & you'll be very pleased)
Dinner portions from the Hibachi menu are huge & delicious!

I recommend this place to anyone within a 20 mile radius!

Oh! The staff is very attentive, helpful, and easy to look at! LOL"}
{"text":"Great place and good sushi for an awesome price! Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely return and I definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and great food selections on their happy hour menu! Yum yum! Our new date night spot!"}
{"text":"Seriously was hungry late at night and stumbled across this place.  Omg I was not disappointed! Being from Hawaii,  I'm picky with my fish and sushi.   And this has been the best place I ate since moving here.  The service here was amazing!  Our server Jeremy was polite,  friendly,  and on top things.   The food! I would recommend the Buffalo Roll!!! Happy hour is from 3pm-Closing!! That's crazy!   Would highly recommend,  and I will be back for more. 


Update:  Been here 3 freakin times since!  Food still freakin awesome haha!  About to become a regular soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here clean, good food, prices and  great service. I meet here with my brother once a week for sushi."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and prompt. The food was good and nice atmosphere.  Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the food and service have always been on point BUT the best thing is the huge HappyHour menu from 3-close! :D everyone is friendly, the place is spotless I mean I don't what else you could want! They also have mochi ice cream which I've had before and am debating ordering again before I leave ;)"}
{"text":"Went back again and found the food and service fabulous. The sushi was extremely fresh and appealing. The salad was delicious as was every teriyaki dish we tried. I highly recommend this new restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is great. Menu includes many non-sushi items for the faint hearted.
The sushi is great, the tempura magnificent. prices are good."}
{"text":"When we arrived on Saturday night around 6:00 PM, I should have seen the sign and walked out immediately. The sign was, there was only about 11 people in the whole place and much of the staff was congregating on the left hand side of the bar talking as if they were the last humans on earth. However, we decided to sit down anyway and have dinner.

We ordered drinks which were ok but when we ordered our appetizer and our meal we expected a little bit of a wait. A wait that would enable us to enjoy our drinks ya know, (1 or 2 sips) but........ our soup came out immediately after our waitress walked into the kitchen and then our salad came out less than 1 minute later. I felt as if this was an order someone else bailed on. This is how fast they came out. I am not kidding, our soup and salad came out in less than 2 minutes.

It wasn't long after that our California rolls came out. Maybe 5 minutes after that. The rolls were not very good. The California rolls at Fry's Market are a lot better but also, getting back to the salad, the salad dressing was creamy on top of the salad but, towards the bottom of the bowl it was watery as if they tried to wash our salad before putting it in the bowl but didn't bother to pour the water out.

But then out came our meal. I ordered the beef teriyaki, and my wife the chicken teriyaki. The vegetables were way overcooked and extremely mushy. They were also brown in some areas. The beef was extremely chewy and the whole experience reminded me of a Bar Rescue episode if you have seen this show on Spike TV you would know what I meant.

The moral of my story is, I am very disappointed in the food and service there and we should have went to the place at Westgate like we originally planned. I will never go here again. Seriously, go in to the place yourself and ask for a to-go menu and be observant of what I mentioned above. I assure you, you will be heading to Fry's to get California Rolls or the noodle aisle to get a $0.25 bag of Ramen noodles to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"i was craving sushi & we hadn't found a good sushi place yet, so i quickly just looked \"sushi\" up on yelp & saw that Uni had amazing reviews so we figured we'd tried it out. we were both very impressed. we sat at the bar, not the best service (we're bartenders though so we're critical), but when we did see our server she was awesome & super nice... we also came in later in the night. we ordered our appetizers & they came out quickly, they were delicious. we ordered some sushi & that was by far some of the greatest sushi ever. very fresh tasting, even at 8 or so at night. we both were very happy & will definitely be back. huge menu selection, pretty good drink menu & a great happy hour menu. we live right down the road, so the convenience is nice factor too! we will be some of the newest regulars!"}
{"text":"Sushi used to be awesome. Almost like eating art. Perfect 99% of the time. Now it's bad 100% of the time. They must have new management or owner and I haven't seen the regular bartender, waitress, or head sushi chef there in over a month. When I ask about them, they are \"on vacation.\" Won't be going here again. Very sad. Rip uni."}
{"text":"This place! Do yourself a favor and stop in. Staff was phenomenal and clearly love what they do. Food was equally as delicious and presentation was beautiful. And folks, the happy hour prices are amazing. Eric recommended some things we would've normally never touched. Great recommendation from a guy who loves what he does! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of sushi. But I live near surprise so i usually have to drive quite a ways to get good sushi. My fiancé randomly found this place. I'm so glad he did! The sushi is good. They have happy hour from 3pm to closing. The service here is great and very friendly. The owner is awesome! I don't want this place to go! I'm only 5mins away so please people stop by and try the sushi! Uni!!! I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"WE WERE SO EXCITED AT FIRST. (Please, understand...if you do NOT have a gluten sensitivity...this is a good restaurant.) Their food was good and worked for us for a while and then.....they suddenly decided that they no longer have gluten free options when they once did. We used to go there weekly to get take out or have a sit down dinner and now...we can't go back again because of this. They unfortunately are no longer an option for our family due to our gluten sensitivities. When we asked about why they don't have that option anymore....the answer we got was \"Sorry.\" Not why or maybe again someday...just sorry. 
When they had gluten free options....we would have given them a \"5\" star rating. They chose to exclude the gluten free community so they get a \"2\" star."}
{"text":"Awesome menu! My family and I love this restaurant. There sushi is fresh and are a great size. They have a happy hour which is to die for. The prices are very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I finally found a good sushi restaurant in Northwest Phoenix.  I didn't get sick after 2 days so I know the fish was fresh and handled properly.  The lunch specials for 12 dollars was right up my alley.  They give you plenty of food as well.  For just 12 dollars, I got a bowl of miso soup, sesame salad, vegetable tempura, a spicy tuna roll, and teriyaki chicken!  That simply can't be beat.  Is it the single greatest sushi I have ever eaten?  No, but after all considerations concerning location and price, I can't help but smile after eating here. 

I highly recommend Uni Sushi, it's the best Japanese restaurant I found so far in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"The service is good here. They are pretty friendly and come over pretty frequently for refills and what not. The inside looks pretty thrown together tho, it doesn't seem like they put a lot of thought into the decor. The sushi is decent, but maybe a little off. They put gigantic chunks of cream cheese in the philly roll and the type of seaweed they use on the fried rolls, (like the Vegas roll for instance) gets kind of hard and sharp after it's been deep fried. Which maybe seems a little dangerous"}
{"text":"So.. I probably should of given them another shake.. I sure did, sit at the sushi bar. They do decent sashimi and at least the last few times I've been there, nice quality fatty tuna (this is seasonal-) The service is far better at the sushi bar, and I do find that while they may not have some creative rolls (I don't do deep fried or stuff filled with cream cheese) the quality of the fish is pretty good. We all have to remember we eat IQF fish in the US when it comes to sushi so I am used to not getting caught this morning tuna sliced up in front of me. The sushi chefs are approachable and quite fun. I've also given a few extra points for being close to me in proximity. Surprise has a struggle to obtain and maintain decent restaurants that aren't chain driven and I try to support indys when due. Definitely a great place for a quick bite of saba and toro."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service! I lived in Okinawa,  Japan for a few years and the red bull roll and orange roll reminded me of Japan. Raw fish was fresh and presentation was lovely. Also had yakisoba and tempura ice cream, all delicious.  My family and I are hooked!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Sushi for the first time. Brought family from CA when they were in town for a visit. Food was amazing! They loved it and said it was comparable to what they get in San Fran. I figure it must be good since we live in the desert! lol! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed having lunch today with my daughter at Uni. This is our first time here and the experience was wonderful. She ordered the shrimp tempura roll and I the Red Bull roll and they were both delightful. We also had the garlic edamame, yum! To finish out lunch we shared green tea mochi. 

The service was good and our waitress was always smiling. It was reasonably priced for everything we ordered at $41.00 for the two of us. 

The only negative thing I have is regarding a couple that sat behind us who complained that one of his rolls took 8 minutes to come out. He requested a discount and when the manager agreed and gave 30% that was not good enough. The nerve of some customers. 

I will come back again and look forward to trying some new dishes."}
{"text":"Reminds me of california sushi bars. By far the best sushi place in surprise. Such a nice environment and the staff are great."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi bar! Great items for cheap on the  happy hour menu. Recommend this place for great sushi."}
{"text":"The food here was great, the service was quick and friendly.  But OMG the Garlic Edamame was FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place
Very clean and friendly
Love the happy hour menu
My favorite roll is the California 
The fried rice is excellent 
The grilled shrimp is even better"}
{"text":"This place is really good but you definitely just want to take advantage of the happy hour menu to really get the best out of your visit! Sushi is really good I've had the teriyaki chicken and steak but wasn't all that impressed. That's why I suggest just going for the happy hour and eating sushi and whatever else is on that along with a Saki and a beer!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible sushi. The quality...not good. The taste, not any better. The decor and ambiance...just weird. We went here based on the 4 star rating and also being California imports. So disappointed. We didn't even finish any of our sashimi or oysters. We left it all because it was that bad. Worst part. $90 tab with tip for fish bait and a wasted date night. Do yourself a favor...don't come here."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday around 3pm. It was pretty busy and they only seemed to have one waiter for the entire area. He tried his best to keep up with everyone, but they could use some more staff for how busy they were. I'm only giving it four stars for that and how long we had to wait for service throughout the meal. The food itself was amazing. My normally picky 12 year old had the angry ramen and loved it. I had a combination plate with spicy tuna rolls and teriyaki chicken and rice. It was presented well and loved every bite. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food great happy hour and awesome service.  Very shocked this place is not more packed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here 3-4x now and it has become a family favorite. The food is priced fairly but the quality is not on par with some other sushi places we like. We had excellent service from Katie on Friday night. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour not only for drinks but food also. The wait staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. The decor is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"Great service and food. New to Surprise and we found our new sushi place. They went above and beyond. Recommended."}
{"text":"10 minutes after being seated I flagged down the manager since our waitress hadn't come by once, even though multiple waitresses attended everyone around us without ever glancing at our table.  Water and a beer was brought to the table.  The beer glass was cracked on the rim.  Since she dropped the drinks off and immediately walked away without saying anything I had to flag down someone else to get a new glass.  Our actual waitress brought back the new glass.  I had to ask if she was indeed our waitress.  We placed orders for appetizers because by this point we were questioning how much we could take.  

The first appetizer arrived 20 minutes before the second.  I had to (again) flag down someone else to ask them for our waitress. She brought the to the wrong table first.   By this point when she did arrive, we asked for our check.  It took her less than a minute to bring the check.

The food?  It looked like it could have been good.  There is NO WAY I would get passed that horrible service to find out though.  The appetizer's were ok.  One was overly deep fried so had a little burnt taste.  The firecracker was good.  We left here and went to Saigon where the service was outstanding as usual. 

It's a shame.  I had writing bad reviews for locally owned places.

If the owner reads this, please take this advice...  Hire a REAL industry professional to come in and teach customer service.  Fire all the friends and family that you employee that clearly have no experience being servers and have no business doing so.  

They took on a large space up front.  Very risky business that makes it hard to manage and it shows."}
{"text":"This is my to go sushi place since I've been in surprise. The sushi is extremely good quality and the prices during happy hour are unbeatable. My wife and I are very picky with our sushi and always have some kind of special request with each roll but uni has never failed to accommodate us. We come here at least 3 times a month and never spend more than 30 dollars each time"}
{"text":"We came upon Uni via Yelp and so happy we had a delicious meal and excellent service! We were tired and hungry at 8 PM and they immediately helped us and they also had a good happy hour menu.
We ordered a couple appetizers and several dishes to share. Appetizers came out fast and hot along with our beers and saki. Our meal was well
presented and tasty fresh sushi.
If we lived in the area we could
easily be regulars. Also very friendly staff and proffesional to handle tired \"hangry\" diners who left satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"I always like coming here.  The food is a great value and the drinks and happy hour menus are really fun for a quick bite or hanging out with friends. The staff is always very friendly and attentive so I never have any complaints. I usually tell others about this place for an affordable and nice atmosphere where you can enjoy sushi or cooked fish if that's what you prefer. I can't speak on 'cooked' items  such as chicken etc. but for everything else I really like this place. I'm by no means a Sushi connoisseur but my hub is and he likes to come here also.  Check it out I don't think you will be disappointed. Will continue to come by."}
{"text":"The firecracker was amazing and the random sushi that I had off other folks plates was awesome.  Recommend!  Everyone at the table had something different and each person liked what they had."}
{"text":"This is mine and my fiances favorite sushi spot. We have tried almost every roll they have and the appetizers are amazing! The best server they have is Jeremy! Hes always making great sugguestions and is super attentive to his guests."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a sushi roll connoisseur...so a 3 rating is good as far as I'm concerned

I've had sushi all over the world (Italy, France, England, Germany, Netherlands, etc...the BEST being Tao, in the Netherlands!!! I'd fly there EVERYDAY for sushi if I could!!) With that being said, it's hard to impress me unless the  ingredients fresh, unique and the rice is superb.

At Uni, the sushi rolls were pretty creative...good variety, and the rice was good...everything was just good...hence the 3 rating. I have no complaints, but nothing to rave about. Oh well, one complaint, WAAAY TOO MUCH sauce on the baked lobster roll. So if you don't like to taste your sushi, this is the roll for you! Otherwise, beware.

I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the spicy tuna roll with seared tuna on top (forgot the name, sorry). I was too starved to snap a photo, but the presentation was not bad either.

They also offer complimentary miso soup, small bite/appetizer, and a fruit dessert surprise with your meal...all were a pleasant surprise.

In conclusion, would I return??...YES! Have I had better??...YES!"}
{"text":"For some reason, Surprise just doesn't quite perform when it comes to Asian food. Oh, we have the brilliantly executed Saigon Kitchen that is one of my top 10 overall Valley places, and Big Buddha is pretty good Chinese if you aren't expecting Flushing or Chinatown. The sad truth is we are a city of chains, and the options are slim.

Take Japanese food, for example. We have two choices if we want to stay in town. First, Fresh Wasabi, which sent me screaming in just three visits. One, adequate. Two, they refused to honor a Groupon or Living Social deal that was purchased just 10 days prior and complied with all rules, which we discovered from a sign on the door in tiny print. You want to drum up new business? Be honorable. 

Third strike, the sushi tasted off, they informed us it was just fine. It was not, and the results were very ugly indeed. Bye, Fresh Wasabi. 

That left us with Uni Sushi and Steak. It offered a bright and funky decor that felt like a disco sports bar. Lots of lunch and dinner combos,  friendly service, and a fab Happy Hour concept.  After some time the Happy Hour changed from all day to limited hours, but we understood. Other things fell from the menu, too, like steaks, hibachi meals and even some of the sodas..

But we forged on, able to fill our bellies with classic Japanese favorites, teriyaki tempura, tofu and assorted yummy bits. 

So when we arrived yesterday and found a bright, nicely printed sign taped to the front door that announced Happy Hour was now Every Day, All Day, we were delighted as we like to mix and match several smaller items. When our server arrived, I asked for the menu, only to be told Happy Hour only from 3-6. When I asked about the sign, she repeated 3-6 only, and left us to chew on our more pricey choices. I started digging in my bag for a scissors so I could down the erroneous door sign and save some other starving soul from being disappointed. 

Yes, the food was mostly fine, but I despise being tricked. Drink service was slow. Our lunch and dinner combos were supposed to have miso soup but it never appeared and we forgot until after we were already gone. The toddler dropped a soy sauce dish and I asked the waitress to replace it, but she simply set it on the next table and ignored it. Later in the meal, he spilled a tiny dish of gyoza dipping sauce, hitting the table, floor and chair, and she stood watching him try to clean it up with his napkin, never offering extras or water to get the drops that hit our clothing. 

The restaurant has a kids' menu and lots of little ones were there. Would it have ruined their budget to bring over a towel?

For a wee child and three adults, the bill for lunch was nearly $80 before tip.   Now, I adore them all and was happy to treat, but for lunch without alcohol, that was way beyond. 

Lucky for us, Phoenix has dozens of Japanese options who welcome our business and don't tape lies on the front door. Uni has talent in the kitchen, but the front of the house needs too much work."}
{"text":"I have given this place two tries now and will not be going here again. Both times the wait for food and service was horrible and the sushi in my opinion was not even worth the wait. The first time we went they forgot entirely about 2 of the sushi rolls we ordered."}
{"text":"Dad got hibachi calamari, which was perfectly cooked! Me and the stepmom got two rolls, house salad, miso soup and some veggie tempura for the whole table. Let's just say, we're stuffed! Not the best soft crab roll, it was just ok, I've had better. Everything else was awesome!!! Best veggie tempura I've ever had! Had to ask for saucers for soy sauce, and the music is crazy (I heard a song about f***ing my a$$) for real... It's a little much, and that's why only 3 stars.  But overall good food and service."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi eater... and I've eaten at many sushi restaurants in my life.

I've been here 3 times so far. It's a newer sushi restaurant, so it's not busy yet. But the food is pretty decent.. both rolls and entrees. Service is decent. Owner is really friendly. The price is a little higher than what I'm used to paying for similar quality.
It's the best in Surprise, AZ area!"}
{"text":"Yum. The Yellow Tail box was outstanding! We also had Anago, yellowtail, spicy tuna, & green tea ice cream with Carmel topping, served like a sundae with cookies & whipped cream. Tip: green tea ice-cream sundae is plentiful, better to share.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Clean. Friendly service. Great prices. Amazing happy hour from 3-close everyday! So glad we decided to give it a try. We ordered a combination of hot food and sushi. Im vegan so i was quite please to see so many available dishes for myself and my carniverous husband was just as satisfied with the menu.

The layout is very open and studio like with asian themed decorations and pops of sports memorabilia. Signed baseballs in a sushi restaurant? I probably wouldve left those in the man cave at home.. Otherwise very clean and we were quite cozy in our booth.

Service was very friendly but slow at the beginning. Took a long time to get our drinks and orders but once that was done service was all uphill from there.
They have soju!! Only other place that serves it is almost an hour away so we are quite pleased to find it. (Soju is a korean clear alcohol distilled from a variety of root vegetables or rice that goes down like water, similar to sake but much smoother and served cold) Just Order the bottle($13) and skip the flavored variations they mix for you, trust me.

Sushi arrived first then hot food which is just how i prefer it. Sushi rice was cooked perfectly and the fresh wasabi ($1 xtra and worth every penny) complemented perfectly without overpowering like the usual powder wasabi mix you get. Husband said his fish was very fresh and sliced perfectly. Hot food arrived and it was good but not great, hence why I didnt give 4stars. They need to work on their bulgogi marinade,  my husbands had lots of bulgogi at many places and he said this one was overly sweet and strong of soy sauce. My kimchi ramen was delicious and the side kimchi was just like home, the ramen did taste of packaged base flavors though, definitely not made from scratch.

All in all, great prices, great selection and we can say we've found a new spot and will be coming back for sure so stock up on that soju Uni!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Happy hour sushi and delicious plum wine , then rainbow roll. Owner decided I needed to try miso soup and she was right , yum !  Hibachi shrimp was fragrant and melted in our mouths . We will be back and will recommend to our friends !"}
{"text":"We went there for a date night and the sushi wasn't that good! I mean it was ok but not the best!! The service was ok too I wouldn't go back or tell anyone to try it! If your looking for just ok I guess this is the place for you."}
{"text":"When it's Happy Hour everyday after 3pm including weekends, a Star(1) just for that.....when I saw that bud lights are $2, Kirin Ichibans are $3, and a 22oz Asahi beer w/ a sake shot is only $5,  a Star (2) just for that.......when they told me the Vegas roll is only $6 and the Spicy tuna roll is only $5 and it also taste GREAT, another Star(3) for that.......then when I experience great service, an entviting atmosphere, and real Japanese chefs preparing the Sushi, they deserve another Star (4)."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and got immediate service. Happy hour 3-close!! Unheard of! We got two drinks, 3 rolls, and a app for under $30. Friendly staff, great food, GREAT prices. Will definitely be back. Who can beat $2 beer and $4 mai tais??"}
{"text":"The food is always great! The Philadelphia Roll is the bomb....salmon melts in your mouth. Staff is friendly! Carrie is super good and takes care of you! Drinks are yummy and the prices are right... Happy Hour everyday.."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants! Can't decide if I enjoyed the Poke Roll or the Akuma Roll more. But the seafood udon pasta is a must have also the salmon sashimi was vape to the nines 

Thanks Jig for great service, recommendations and also for being on top of your refill 

I'll be back for happy hour next week!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous giving this place three stars. Japanese is my second language and I've spent almost two years of my life in Japan. That being said, sushi in America isn't anything close to Japanese Sushi. Like many other foods from other countries, we've Americanized Sushi and have made it palatable for the unsophisticated pallet that likes to act so snobbish and highbrow while eating a sushi roll LOL!!! Folks, you eat sushi with your hands, not chopsticks, so get over yourself! Why is it almost every American Sushi joint is ran by Koreans and in Arizona and California, Mexicans help to create and serve American Sushi. Uni was a major let down, as my (sushi ??) had (fish ????) that was not just room temperature, but was hot from rice that had not been properly cooled before forming (???rice with seafood on top). The quality was a 4 out of 10 and the service was sub par. The Wi-Fi didn't even work properly. No doubt, a ton of wannabe AMERICAN sushi enthusiasts will scorn my diatribe, even if it's absolute truth. The truth hurts, if you want to lie to yourself to feel better, by all means. As for my wife and I, we're done with this place. My wife had purchased \"Seafood Udon,\" that was listed under \"Ramen,\" which she had specifically asked our waitress \"That comes in soup form, right?\" To which the server replied \"Yes, of course.\" WRONG! A hot mess of buckwheat-noodles and seafood were brought out on a plate, SERIOUSLY!? In the Phoenix metropolitan area, ( Sushi Roku \"6\")is as close as you're going to get to semi authentic. They have blue fin at times and although they are pricey, it's worth it. Please, if you see someone eating sushi with their hands, take your thumb out of your backside and understand, they are eating the sushi correctly, you're the stuck up dork that believes chop sticks make you look cool and separate you from the other ( Gaijen Foreigner) but your still Gaijen and so am I. The Japanese will never accept you as one of their own, so get over yourself. Take a pass on Uni, it's subpar and filled with pretentious twits!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in town! Great service, cold beer, Friendly staff and best of all...HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY starting at 3. Try the \"Honda Roll\" never disappoints"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate here for the first time while out running errands around lunch time.  We decided to split the teriyaki chicken.  The waiter brought a salad to each of us even though only one salad actually came with one order.  How nice was that?!  The dish was absolutely delicious and we had more than enough to feel satisfied!  If you haven't given this place a try, you definitely need to plan a dinner there soon.  Service was outstanding.  Food was unbeatable!  Restaurant was super clean and spacious.  We will be stopping in again very soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and they have a great happy hour menu. Whether you like traditional Japanese food or sushi this place has very fresh good food and prices."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times no problem. Went in for Happy Hour two days ago and am now suffering from food poisoning. I know it was the sushi, as everything else I ate I had made myself with no problems. It couldn't have been the following Easter dinner because the rest of my family isn't sick.

Really sad, I wanted to like this place because it had great prices. Will be skipping this place in the future for more expensive and quality fish."}
{"text":"Fav sushi in surprise!! They have a good happy hour :) Nice environment & everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Growing up in Seattle with a family in the fish industry means I know good fish--Uni has good fish! The salmon (sake) is amazing, the albacore was delicious, the uni was good too. Their vegetables (garlic edamame, asparagus, and substitute veggies with the chicken teriyaki instead of rice) are perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cocktails are great, they have Kirin Ichiban and Sapporo on tap, and delicious reasonably priced sake. We will keep coming back and told all of our friends to come too! Service is great, so many smiles!"}
{"text":"Very impressed ...I'm  very picky on sushi ..iam from cali where are sushi is really the best.so I know how sushi should taste and what I expect....rolls were very good, very tasteful ,came out in about 20 mins on a busy day so that not bad ...I would recommend this place for sushi any day and will be a regular here the baked rolls were my favorite. .. Scallop rolls lobster rolls were the bomb ... Jalapeno rolls for the app my fav...."}
{"text":"There was a fly flying around my food while I was eating. The fire crackers were okay. The calamari was definitely a no no, it came with barbecue and ranch. I would except it to come with eel sauce or other Japanese sauces. The quality it's far from yardhouse and kabuki's calamari. The poki roll was 14 dollars, but for the amount of fish they put on top of it was not worth it. The server wasn't attentive at all. This place is WAY over-rated. One more thing, it's that I saw the sushi chief picking something up with his hands and eating it. That grosses me out so much. Their prices were very similar to kabuki, therefore I suggest you go to kabuki instead of here if distance isn't a problem for you."}
{"text":"YES!  All the deliciousness of table tepanyaki, but about $10 a plate less.  I had a steak and chicken combo, the steak was perfect, but the chicken was teriyaki.  Not my favorite, but that's on me, not them.  For a couple of bucks more, I will do the fillet mignon next time.

Have you ever cooked broccoli or a green vegetable so perfectly, it's that perfect green color and still has the right amount of crunch to it?  All the veggies come out that way.  Piping hot, perfect veggies, gooey fried rice.  All the elements of a killer meal, not to mention the miso and salad. 

This is our second time here, and we'll probably be back for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in ... well everything. The service was not good. Took too long for us to receive our adult beverages and they were coming at different times. I believe our waiter was new and everyone has to be new at some point but there was a disconnect for sure. $12 patron shots.... rolls were undersized. Just very disappointed. The food didn't taste bad which is why they got the 2 stars but for a place that busy I was expecting more"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places in surprise. The happy hour deal is awesome. The staff is always friendly and helpful when I have questions. There is hardly ever a wait, and if there is it's not long. Bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and delicious sushi 
We had California roll and spicy tuna roll.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time in and we order the Vegas roll, California roll, shrimp tempura and Philadelphia roll. Honestly it was nothing special. I felt like there was more rice than anything else. Not much flavor or meat in the rolls. I doubt I'll ever come here again. She the price is low but when I come to eat sushi I expect better flavor and better quality rolls. 

Disappointed."}
{"text":"The gyoza was served cold. Sushi served warm. Everything looked like it had been on the belt for too long. The lids looked old and like they need to be replaced. Disappointed."}
{"text":"So nice to have a decent sushi place in surprise. Always consistently good and the happy hour is great."}
{"text":"Their happy hour specials are awesome! Rolls for $3? $5 sake bombs? Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm a girl and even I was taken aback by the female staff wearing the little schoolgirl skirts.  Ok guys, don't all rush in all at once!

I'm a little biased, living in Surprise but I've also been to a LOT of sushi restaurants in Arizona and I've been to all three that exist in this city.  By FAR Uni is better than the other two.  It's a bit more expensive on some rolls than some places, but the service is great, the size of the rolls are standard to larger, and I always leave full and happy.  I'm sure sushi lovers understand that sometimes price can also be affected by quality of fish or the size of the roll.  For two of us, we ate for $30.  We probably could have done a little less but couldn't resist an extra order of unagi!

Some tips for the best value if you come by:

1.  They just extended their Happy Hour.  It's now 3pm until close.
2.  If you sit at the sushi bar, you get a couple of freebies in the form of a deliciously refreshing cucumber salad, and miso soup.
3.  Lunch is $12 and includes miso soup, salad, one of three sushi rolls, a small shrimp tempura platter, and a large bowl of udon noodles.  This meal lasted me three days total!  If you have to prioritize what to eat and what to keep, the udon noodles taste great reheated.  Tempura and sushi rolls....not so much - so eat those first!  For $15 you can pick more premium rolls.

I've been coming in to dine at Uni for awhile now and have had the pleasure of seeing the fan base grow.  The owner is very community oriented and is open to suggestions.  I don't want this place to go away, so help us Surprisians keep this place around!

Some of my favorite rolls - 

The Red Bull Roll
Poke Roll
Lollipop Roll

And we can't forget the UNAGI!

So to sum up - I didn't put 5 stars to it because I can't honestly say it's the best sushi I've ever had.  But I have never had a bad meal or experience, and it is my favorite in Surprise.  I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Service was great , the edamame and miso soup weren't too warm but the sushi was awesome especially the caterpillar and shrimp tempura rolls"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We had the Red Bull roll, highly recommended. The staff was great, our server was very attentive, and the chef is really good. All in all, a great experience. I'm glad that we now have a truly stellar sushi place in Surprise."}
{"text":"Another great find due to Yelp reviews.

1.  Happy Hour 3-Close, with a number of great selections on that menu.
2.  Presentation/Creativity in food preparation is outstanding. See, e.g., the Lollipop Roll.
3.  The Red Bull roll lives up to its yelp reviews.
4.  Although I saw a few negative reviews on service, my experience was outstanding.
5.  Not sure how you can beat $4 house cab at dinner time on a Saturday night.
6.  The $3 California roll on the HH menu was 8 good sized pieces. The prices might be small but the portions aren't.
7.  Overall great value for the money.
8.  Can't wait to go back!  What a great find.

Arigato gozaimashita!

And thanks again, Yelp!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and nice happy hour times/prices. I will be returning for those factors. The service initially sucked though. Walked in to an empty post (they weren't busy either) and waited a while before someone noticed. Once someone noticed, I told them we wanted to sit at the bar and pointed to sushi bar and was acknowledged, so we walked over. She didn't follow us and never brought menus. After a while someone else came by and brought us all the menus and took over. Much better service from the second guy."}
{"text":"This sushi place is pretty good.  Sushi is reasonable alcohol section is good and they have an excellent happy hour.

As far as Japanese food in this town it might be as good as one can expect in the middle of the dessert."}
{"text":"We ate at Uni Sushi in Surprise last night. The place is spacious and not crowded, but the sushi was served lukewarm and my Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta tasted like someone dropped a jar of cayenne pepper into it! (This comes from a person who LOVES hot & spicy food!)"}
{"text":"Decided to try some sushi in the area as our family loves sushi from CA. I was really excited for this place after seeing some promising reviews. The salad and dressing was good but all the fish is stale. The texture on good quality fish vs stale old fish is huge. Eating raw fish as sashimi should be clean and silky. When it gets old it starts getting gritty and loses flavor. Like an old sponge. Yuck. 2 stars for good service and atmosphere.  Sorry Arizona, this is not good sushi. I would have guessed this fish to be at least several months old."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in during happy hour on a Thursday. The happy hour menu was quite nice since it had lots to choose from. We had the Firecracker appetizers which we loved! Stuffed jalapeños lightly deep fried with a spicy sauce drizzled on top. Yum! We order the Las Vegas roll, Soft Shell Crab roll and the Red Bull Roll. The Red Bull roll was money! It had a smoky flavor to the meat and was just straight up delicious! The Las Vegas roll was your basic role that you can get at most sushi places. However the soft shell crab roll seemed a bit on the fishy side. By far not my favorite soft shell crab roll at this spot. Service was wonderful! When we sat at the bar we were served a small cucumber salad which was delicious and after our meal we were given a small fresh orange to clean our palates. Everybody was friendly and we would return to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was full, but the food and atmosphere are terrible.  It's a box retail space with dark walls and everything is dingy.  After our food arrived, the smell of animal urine (rats? cats? don't know) became overwhelming-- seemingly coming from the air conditioning vents.  The sushi rice was overcooked and the fish was mostly mashed up bits, with a few better looking pieces on top-- I ate some and then was a bit terrified that I was going to be sick.  I was not, but really, I've had tuna fish sandwiches that were more like sushi."}
{"text":"Gotta check out this places happy hour specials. Off the hook."}
{"text":"Ask for Choi ! My husband and I went for dinner and left very happy!! Choi was incredibly sweet, informative, and food was delicious and decent priced. GREAT happy hour!"}
{"text":"Overall a decent sushi place for Arizona. The sushi itself was delicious. The playlist was also enjoyable. The biggest disappointment was the wait... I went with a table of 4. We split the order into 2 (couples). One couple got their order in an expected amount of time. We began eating not knowing that it would take another 25 minutes for the second couple to receive their food. It's frustrating since the point to go out to eat with other people is... To eat together... Half of the table shouldn't get their food half an hour later. We were there at 630 on a Saturday night but not all the tables were full. We will probably try a few other sushi places before we return here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place of all time! I have tried various places all over the West Valley and the prices and quality of food here wins it all! Great servers who are very attentive and overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Uni is my favorite sushi restaurant they have fresh fish and a great atmosphere. The owner and staff are always so friendly when my boyfriend and I go in. Their happy hour prices are cheaper than anywhere in town. Sake bombers are less than $5 and the happy hour menu is incredible! It is my new favorite happy hour spot. I recommend this place to everyone looking for a great place to eat in surprise!"}
{"text":"Having that craving for some ramen and searching the area for a good spot to try, my wife and I decided to give Uni Sushi a go.

Here's what we had:
-Gyoza
-Chasyu Ramen (shoyu based broth with noodles, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, broccoli, green onion and cabbage, topped with slices of pork.
-Fish & Chips (wife loves fish and chips)

Our server was friendly and the half-off happy hour appetizers were worth taking advantage of. 

The food was just okay. The gyoza seemed out of a frozen bag with the interior texture mushy. Not bad but not good. My wife thought the fish in the fish and chips was a little over done but she was hungry. The ramen was not what I expected of a shoyu broth. This ramen tasted to me like a watered down chicken noodle soup. Again, not bad but not good or what I was expecting. A good ramen base is the foundation for the rest of the dish. 

I would like to go back and try some of the other dishes but Uni Sushi & Steak is not high on the list."}
{"text":"One word... Amazing! We have been going her since the first week it opened and it is consistently amazing every time.( we go about 3 times a month) the lettuce wraps are soooo good and the sushi is so fresh; the prices are good, and we get great customer service everytime.You can't go wrong with this place!  #1 sushi joint in Surprise. ( oh and my husband lived in Japan so he knows good sushi!)"}
{"text":"So we are new to the area and this is the first sushi restaurant we have visited in the area. This is a new place so upon arrival for a Saturday night it was very slow, also I think they need more to livin up the outside to make it seem more inviting. Okay upon entry we were greeted by the two sushi chefs like you find in most sushi joints. We were promptly seated since there were only 4 other tables being serviced. Anywho, we had an avacoda/crab appetizer that was delicious. My wife had the shrimp and steak Hibachi and we were both very happy with it overall, taste was great..the steak was a little too fatty for my wife. I myself had the teriyaki beef and found it to be seasoned just right. We ordered a baked lobster roll that was amazing. We usually do the typical tuna and cali type rolls but since we were doing full on meals and not just sushi we went with the ladder. Overall everything we ate was great. What really made me like this place was the fact how friendly everyone was. I have two young kids so we don't eat out much because there short attention spans usually have us wanting to leave after appetizers arrive. The waitress always interacted with both children when she came to the table and the sushi chefs sent out a origami  orange and whipped cream desert on the house that my kid really enjoyed. It was something they just tossed together but I found it pretty cool to help keep the kids from really loosing it at the table. We live a few miles away so I see this becoming our sushi spot when we craving it for sure. For the quality and quantity of the food and the service I was fine dropping a bill for dinner here. I sure hope they keep it up and manage to stick around."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever received. If i could rate it less than 1 star i would. First I called ahead to make sure that there wouldn't be a wait and that I didn't need a reservation and when we got there they told me it would be a 25 min wait. Not that big of a deal really got seated and was looking at the menu asked the server to give us a minute he took our drink order grabbed us a highchair came back with our drinks and never asked if we were ready to order just turned and walked away and never came back we sat with our 17 month old for over an hour and still never was asked if we had been helped and our server never came to our table again so we got up and left."}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in the Northwest Valley. Great food and drinks. Very friendly staff and wonderful service. Been here a few times now and each time is just as good as the last. Our \"Go To\" place for Sushi."}
{"text":"It's our first time trying out this place...hubby and I are very meticulous when it comes to Asian foods, especially Japanese..and of course we have our favorite place to go..as Asian myself, cooking is my passion, and you know when I go out to eat, I can be the most picky! Of course I know what and how an asian dish is considered delicious,  there are a bunch of factors that needs to be considered haha. ;-) it should be done the right way to for it that taste right. 
So yeah, this place is surprisingly good! no wonder why they have lots of diners in here..Our newly favorite Mexican food place is just close to this restaurant so we always see people coming in here and sometimes  waiting outside. 
Their food is good, I mean not excellently good, but they are good! hubby ordered some sushi rolls, he noticed they're warm already, you know sea foods especially fish should be kept cold to prevent food poisoning. I tasted it, it was good. Our server was nice, she just made a mistake though, when I ordered the seafood udon, I asked her if it was a soup..and she nodded, when she brought it, it was actually a stir fry not a soup! LOL :-D 
Oh well they taste good, but that would not justify her mistake. haha.  yeah, it's indeed very important for servers  to be very familiar with their menus, to be able to answer questions right because if they encounter people with attitude, oh man they're gonna get humiliated..you know what I mean. 
Uni Sushi, you are a good food place. It's just that there some things needs to be improved in order for you to attract more diners! and oh I think it's better if you guys use crystal drinking glass for your drinks because I noticed the plastic cups that you use look a little dirty or cloudy, not very hygienic! tsk! you know it's always appetizing to be drinking from a crystal clear cups. Cleanliness is a key factor or one of the most essential elements in a restaurant business..because even if  your foods are great,if the utensils, plates and cups that you use to serve your customers are dirty, I don't think they would want to come again."}
{"text":"Had an assortment of specialty rolls. Very good service and great quality sushi. We will return to sample more of the menu.

Owner came over and was very nice. I hope this does well. Great location and large dining area.

The entire staff is friendly. Glad we found a good place to have Sushi"}
{"text":"Yummy :) I'm a sushi snob but I can not complain about anything here, the fresh taste of the rolls are spectacular, try Spicy Tuna Land soooo very good, Rainbow roll was great tasting and fish was fresh, I have been to great sushi bars/restaurants in Scottsdale, Phoenix and this Surprise restaurant kept up with the taste, finally a sushi place in Surprise I'm so happy. Try this place it's worth it, the price is right on for a sushi place not cheap but not over the line."}
{"text":"Delicious. Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in the area. Everything we tried was exquisite, and the service provided by Carrie was Amazing. Made us feel welcome and like she knew us for ever."}
