{"text":"03/20/16 My wife and I tried numerous south indian restaurants across over the last few months and we guess the search has come to an end. On the top of our list for south indian food from now on. A must try, especially if you love your indian coffee :) 5 stars to the food and service!"}
{"text":"Terrible wait time!!! and those who came after us got their food before we did. They didn't even give water... Pathetic...Not coming back ever and definitely wouldn't recommend to any of our friends"}
{"text":"Woodlands is everything I could ever want in an Indian food restaurant.  The food was excellent.  I have tried malai kofta and aloo palak at many Indian food restaurants and I can confidently say that Woodlands versions of these dishes is among the best.  The portions were a very descent size and there was just the right amount of spiciness to the food (if you like it hot, I recommend telling your waiter you want the food \"India Spicy\" , which the Indian patron sitting at the neighboring table told the waiter).  The naan was cooked fresh and to perfection.  The samosas were delicious.  Not only is the food excellent, the menu items are very reasonable priced.  About $10 an entree and this INCLUDES rice, which typically needs to be ordered separately at Indian restaurants.  Also, the service was good.  The waiter was attentive enough and the food came out very quickly.  The restaurant interior is clean and to the point.  Honestly, I'm tempted to not even bother trying any other Indian food restaurants in Charlotte because I found a keeper."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and had Gobi manchurian, Mysore Dosa. The Manchurian was bland and I could taste the flour in it. Dosa was equally tasteless.  I have been there before and it had pretty good dosa's. Dunno what happened."}
{"text":"Been there couple of times with friends and family. Food is ok, nothing great. Service is bad. Avoid their restrooms."}
{"text":"Average food in buffet, food www not hot, wierd combination of items in buffet.."}
{"text":"If Woodlands isn't the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte then its a close second!  The food is De-Lish!  I am vegan and I love that they are willing to alter ingredients to accommodate my dietary requests.  They also offer organic dishes if you prefer.  So far, I haven't been disappointed and will continue to eat my little heart out at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with family for Lunch. With average expectations.  We ordered Chola Bhatura, Chilli Pakora, Schzewan Noodles, Mushroom Masala, and more.   As per my friend this was the best Chola Bhatura in US, I loved the schzewan noodles its like typical Indo-Chinese flavor that is available in India.  Very good place, surprisingly very distinct Indian food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to an Indian restaurant since I moved to the US from India. I didn't have high expectations but it turned out to be great. The service was good. Since they have a buffet on Sundays we opted for that. It was $11 per person and it came with a free Dosa at the end of the meal( you can choose from plain dosa or masala dosa). The buffet food was tasty. They had tandoori roti, palak paneer, some south indian curry,rice, custard, kheer and lot of other stuff to choose from. My favorite was the Pulao Rice with the Palak Paneer. They had a cleanliness rating of 100 which I have not seen in any other restaurant. Over great place to enjoy an Indian meal. Recommended."}
{"text":"Best indian vegetarian place in Charlotte. Don.t miss its chilly paneer"}
{"text":"First off, a very big THANK YOU to all of you Charlotte Yelpers who reviewed this place!!!!  Very nice to see honest, thoughtful reviews of places in town when I come in to visit my wife's family.    After looking up another Indian place to eat in the area I came across a listing for Woodlands made by other folks on Yelp.  Upon seeing so many positive reviews my wife and I decided to meet my in-laws there for dinner this evening.  Tucked back in a nondescript area across from an Inn-Town Suites and next to a strip mall shopping center, this place is an amazing find.    As one local Yelper  Tonya P. stated in a review, the menu can be daunting but our server was patient and took her time explaining various dishes to our party.  On her recommendation we ordered a sampler platter of various appetizers and was not disappointed. It was like a Nicholas Cage movie because it was \"Gone In Sixty Seconds\" I can tell you that.  So good.   Everyone ordered something different but I only remembered what my wife and I ordered so apologies for that.  I ordered the Mushroom Mutter Curry and she ordered the Vegetable Korma which were both wonderful.  My in-laws dishes were delicious and the sharing that my wife did with her folks told me they loved the dishes they had too.  I'm a greedy bastard and chose not to share which I regret to the fullest now.    Service was good, the place was busy but not overly crowded, and the food was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and eat there again.  If you're a local of Charlotte, who loves Indian food and you have not been to Woodlands, well you need to correct that serious error in judgement right away."}
{"text":"This is simply a hidden jewel of Charlotte. If you're whole food plant based diet, vegetarian, or vegan you will especially enjoy this place. Food is done with passion and such great taste. Indian people eat here and you know they know what's going on!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I can give zero stars. Too much price for average food.  Do not trust the positive reviews. Either they were written by the restaurant staff or someone who do not know how Indian food is supposed to taste. Ordered Royal Thali for $27. Hardly anything royal about the Thali. It's a rip off.  There are many better restaurants in Charlotte that serve better food for better prices. I would rather go there. Do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. We visited couple of times and tried different dishes. All dishes were not at all fresh and everything is highly priced. Sambar and Chutney not at all tasty. Avoid this Restsurant  if you're looking for authentic south indian veggy food."}
{"text":"Best noodles in the town. And awesome Paper masala dosa."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have not gotten anything that wasn't delicious here. The biryani is great as are all of the dosas that I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I was driving from Atlanta to Virginia when I decided to stop in Charlotte and have a nice dinner. So I went to woodlands and ordered a dosa. After about five minutes a waiter came over and asked me if I had ordered. I said yes and pointed to the other staff member who had talked to me, but then he wanted to know wether he had written it down. Strange. I said I did not know. Then the original waiter came over and apologized for forgetting about my order. After waiting for another 15 to 20 minutes for my food, I got up to use the rest room. I came back to see they had given away my seat to someone else! So I was left waiting for a table. As luck would have it, my dosa arrived while I was waiting. The waiter had the gall to ask me to sit at a storage shelf and eat the food! It did not even have any legroom or a chair, and was in a dark dirty corner. I refused. So they cleaned up a table and let me have my food, not reheated may I add. Overall the experience left me disappointed. The good was ok, but not delicious. Perhaps someone with restaurant management experience could enlighten me. Is it really that hard for three people and a manager to serve 17 tables?"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a very poor experience at Woodlands, although we had high hopes, having read good reviews and both loving vegetarian Indian food. I ordered an eggplant curry (baigan bartha) and a green salad; my friend ordered, from the organic selections, a palak aloo that according to the menu was supposed to come with rice, a salad, \"hot salsa,\" and applesauce. Well, I received my salad first, ice cold out of the fridge, with an almost-empty bottle of balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing (there was no choice in dressing offered-- I was just handed the bottle). My friend's salad was nowhere to be seen, so she asked the waiter, who seemed rather confused about whether she was supposed to get one. When it came, her \"salad\" was just greens in a bowl. Dinner came quickly-- the curries and some rice for each of us, but my friend did not receive the \"hot salsa\" or the applesauce. When she asked about the applesauce, the waiter said she wasn't getting it. At least we were given our curries, which were passable. This restaurant needs to get its act together with regard to service, accuracy of the menu, and quality of its food. I can't recommend it and certainly will not go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving through Charlotte the other day and looked up places to eat that were vegan-friendly.  We found Woodlands and their menu looked great, so I called up to order.  The man I spoke with was very helpful, telling me which entrees had dairy and which ones didn't.  We arrived there to pick up our order, and everything was ready and hot.  We had to wait to eat until we got to my in-laws about an hour away, but everything was still semi-warm and delicious!!  The Chaat was really tasty, my favorite! We also got the Samosas, the chickpea masala, Dal, wheat Naan, and rice.  Yum!!  We will definitely be back to this place!!"}
{"text":"Good appetizers and dishes,  Taste is good and authentic. I will visit again for appetizers, dosa's, snacks. Only thing not happy with is Thali--very uninteresting and bland for the price."}
{"text":"This is the REAL DEAL when it comes to southern Indian flavors. All the items are outstanding and taste like what I ate while in Bangalore and Coimbatore."}
{"text":"Very bad quality of food and service. I do not recommend going here. Tried their mango lassi and it tasted horrible. Was served with spoiled chutney along with dosa. Least to say, management is worst!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. First of we call to find if they are open, they didn't even told us their timing. When we reached there, the LADY was rude and said they're closed. No courtesy to be polite. Zero customer service, now imagine the food one would get! People go to restaurants not only for food but decent customer service! Guys, be prepared for bad food and WORST customer service at Woodlands Charlotte! I have been to Woodlands in Orlando and my experience is totally opposite so thought let me try this place. Never ever going to Woodlands Charlotte."}
{"text":"Indian lady at counter... Lady like her will only have negative rating for business. Don't know how to deal with customers. We went for dosa lunch buffet and after serving 2 dosa they said it will be extra charge plus buffet charge in middle of lunch . They don't understand what buffet means and the lady kept coming to our table to tell us you can take once per dish in buffet. WILL NEVER GO AGAIN AND I SUGGEST EVERY ONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR BAD TRICKS TO CHAGRE EXTRA."}
{"text":"Roaches everywhere! Dead and alive! We got out of the restaurant even before we could place an order."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience with this visit. No one took order for more than 15 min after we got the table for which we had to wait 10min. After all this, a lady came to take order. When we asked to make the order fast, the answer she gave was \"I am not cooking\". That was so rude. Better she changes her attitude to have repeating customers.  Coming to food, dosa taste was ok but would prefer hot instead of cold soda. Two stars are for the taste, otherwise I wish there is an option for negative rating."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food, and very kind staff. We hosted a Young Professionals dinner event and received wonderful service. The thali plates are great! The manager is generous and friendly and treated us as her own guests. By dinner time, the place was full of Indian families dining and it was clear many of them are frequent patrons. Highly recommend it, especially for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Again.. Same kind of response from the staff.. Careless and they even used bad words when myself and my cousin asked about quality of the food.. Worst restaurant.. Worst management"}
{"text":"Vegetarian heaven! This place has been one of my favorites for quite some time. The menu is tremendous, service is friendly and atmosphere relaxed. I have never had something I didn't like from this place. My best suggestion is to order a handful of items from the menu and share with everyone at your table so you can try more! You can't mess up. The staff is always happy to make recommendations if you're feeling indecisive. I love ordering takeout from here too."}
{"text":"Yes to all of the above.  Woodlands is simply fantastic.  Though we'd been wanting to try it for a while, we hadn't trekked out to Woodlands simply because it was (in our eyes) all the way out in the boonies off Albemarle Road.  Despite growing up in the CLT, I can count on one hand the times I have actually driven on Albemarle Road (imagine my surprise then, when we passed the old Eastland Mall, and I was all, \"OHHHH... THIS is where Eastland used to be\").  ANYWAY.  Last night, however, searching for a restaurant that wasn't participating in Restaurant Week, we decided to head out to Woodlands, and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there.  Excellent.  Despite previous reviews, the exterior and decor weren't particularly off-putting... it seems to me that almost every great Indian place I've eaten at has a very similar set-up (Udipi in Cary, anyone?), so it felt like home.  I do love opening a menu and knowing I can order anything off it.  This time, I settled on the chef's specialty of chana batura, and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan.  The puffy bread with my dish was like a light, unsweetened funnel cake - fried, indulgent deliciousness - and it sopped up the chana so very well.  The chana were perfect.  Husband's aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty, and the garlic naan just blew me away.  Yum to absolutely everything.  We also ordered a couple samosas, which were also perfect... just the right amount of spice, and flaky beyond belief.  The service was excellent, for what it's worth.   Although we've got Maharani around the corner (which I like very much), as well as Copper (which underwhelms me, despite all its hoopla), I imagine we'll be making the well-worth-it drive out to Woodlands when we're in the mood for particularly fabulous Indian food.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Woodlands has great vegetarian Indian food.  Everything I have tried was really good.  Only downside is the lackluster atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went for a weekend buffet. Food was average and not much variety. They charged for a two a half year kid as well. Average and overpriced."}
{"text":"I won't come again.  Service is so bad and food was not that great.  Experienced twice Same thing.  Only one server with bunch of attitude and did not come for 15 min."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, there are very few restaurants that have a diverse menu.  Woodsland is such a place.  I frequent various ethnic restaurants due to the fact that so many cater more to vegetarians than  American restaurants.  I also like the fact that Indian people frequent here as it lets me know that their food is authentic Indian cuisine and not some Americanized version of Indian food.    Their focus is southern Indian cuisine.   I am a regular customer.  They have an award winning appetizer, Samosa Chat, that is wonderful.   I cannot count how many times I have order that item.   They also have a variety of Dosas that many Indian eateries do not have on their menu.   They also have a variety of curries, rice  specialties and  assortment of breads.  They even have an organic menu.  I have been to other Indian places that may have better Dal Mahani but if you are a vegetarian and enjoy Indian food than Woodlands if your place.  The biggest drawback is that their service WILL be slow at busy time as they usually only have two wait staff working."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a negative rating. There was an Indian lady who was serving with a very bad attitude.... We ordered a dish and it was not tasting good so we requested for addition of spice, so she took back the dish and added hell lot of spice and literally threw it at our table. If they don't want to server the customers in a gentle way , I really wonder why they want to run such businesses and spoil the mindset of people who are dining in..!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Best thing for a vegetarian. But service was a little off. Could have worked more on service."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS delicious and fast. I've been countless times. Lots of organic and vegan options. They're always willing to assist you on choices and suggestions too. My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte food wise, tho all the booth seats need to be replaced or repaired as the springs have broken and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food was ok until I found a finger nail in my food and also a questionable object in my food. I was highly disappointed especially since there are so many rave reviews on this site. Will never go again. I tried to call to advise but no answer. I left an message. I also emailed them. I will be contacting them about this."}
{"text":"Authenthic veg indian food,, dosas are awesome.. U r going to love it. Service was ok"}
{"text":"There masala dosa was awesome. Curries and naan were above average. Overall the food is good, but staff including owner are very serious and unfriendly. Better to take \"to go\" food."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant few times. But recently we have bad experiences . Owner was rude. Also food has become bad.. sambar taste is not good as like before . Dosa batter is not good . Too much salt in some food . I don't know how these people running business with rude behavior and bad quality food . Another thing is food is very costly but quality is not comparable to it . Best thing in South Indian cuisine is sambar but recent sambar taste has gone bad .. I don't know what has happened. We may not visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Woodlands' lunch buffet based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the food did not meet my expectations and it was pricier for a hole-in-the-wall joint.   There weren't very many options: \"salad bar\" (a large platter of limp salad with some sauces and onions surrounding it), a soup, bread, some fritter-type thing (not samosas), rice, noodles, a dessert, and about 4-5 kinds of curry. I know that sounds like a decent number of options, but all the curries tasted alike except for the saag paneer. I love saag paneer, but this was thin and bland. In fact, all the curries were watery... My plate had a pool of water that separated from the curries. I've never encountered that before.   The dining area was cramped and small. Which is fine... I don't expect ambience from a small ethnic place. But there was also no temp control -- it was sweltering hot... Which doesn't pair well with spicy-ish food.  The staff was nice, but incredibly slow.   I would not return of my own volition."}
{"text":"I have eaten there multiple times since they first opened.  I actually was one of the first customers, and I have taken several friends there..  The food is very good and they have a quite extensive menu of choices .  I have not been to the buffet yet, but I will try it soon.  I don't eat out very often period because of being poor, but this is a place I would recommend for flavorful as well as healthy food."}
{"text":"We visited Woodlands at 8PM on a Saturday night. The restaurant was completely packed with local Indian families, which I take to be an excellent sign that the food is authentic.  Unfortunately, the wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed. It took 20 minutes for someone to even come by our table and take our orders, and another 20 minutes for our Samosas to come out of the kitchen. Once we had the Samosas, the rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, but waiting until 8:40 for our food was agonizing. I was sat with my back to the kitchen and I was so hungry that I kept looking over my shoulder, to the point that my husband said, \"Trust me honey - once it looks like our food is coming I will stand up and *applaud* there is no reason to keep looking behind you.\"  Service and food slowness aside, our meals were excellent. I ordered the Chana Masala. My husband ordered Dal Makhani. I had reservations about visiting a vegetarian Indian restaurant, but the food was really very, very good. Woodland's won't ever be the first on my list to visit, because I prefer meat-based dishes, but if you've got a vegetarian friend who wants to eat somewhere, don't shy away from Woodlands because there's no meat on the menu.  The service wasn't terribly friendly, which is quite different from what I'm accustomed to with my favorite Indian restaurants (my favorite places are in DC, actually). But the food was terrific.  Woodlands was quite a haul from our Ballantyne home, but it was good to visit once to see what the fuss was all about. The food was fantastic, but with the distance, long waits to get our food and poor service, I doubt we will be back. If you're in the area and hankering for Indian food at a less busy time, I recommend visiting."}
{"text":"I had the Mushroom Mutter Curry and it was tasty. My friend had the South Indian Thali vege sampler which I thought was so-so. The Naan was freshly made and excellent. Points for being all vegetarian and serving beer."}
{"text":"I've been going to Woodlands for something like 15 years. It is by far the best Indian food I have ever had anywhere I've lived. Every time I come to Charlotte, I try to go to Woodlands to get my fix. It's hard to pick a favorite dish there. Order the appetizer sampler and anything else. It's all truly delicious."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were recently guided to this place by searching for and reading reviews for good indian places in CLT on yelp.  Neither of us are vegetarian, but it doesn't even matter at this place.  The food is fantastic, and is very hearty.  You don't even realize that what you are consuming lacks some form of animal protein!!  Each time I've visted the restaurant, I've tried a different dish....and I haven't had one thing that I didn't like.  If you like spicy cuisine, I highly recommend the Baigon Bartha or the Veg Vindaloo (listed in the Curry section of the menu.)  I also suggest getting a couple orders of the Garlic naan to go along with your meal.    All in all, great Indian food, good prices, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We had buffet here. It was really poor. Very less options and food was extremely poor. Service was bad. I would never go back. May be people are going there due to lack of options in Charlotte. If you have ever had South Indian food don't even plan to try."}
{"text":"Not sure who gave 4 or 5 stars may be owner himself... one of the worst ever indian restaurent.. Ordered roti and it came after 30 minutes complained to owner and he said less staff and staff doesnt understand anything.. never ever visit again.."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Most Indian restaurants cater to North Indian dishes but this one is mainly South Indian. Try the dosas, idli and vadas for a true South Indian cuisine. The chaat (quick snack/street food) - sev puri and paani puri tasted authentic. Very clean restaurant. Great tasting food and friendly staff. Didn't have to wait for long after placing an order. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! The food is heavenly: super fresh and perfectly spiced. My favorite curry dish is the Paneer Makhani,. Favorite appetizer is the Paneer Pakora. The Poori bread and the Garlic Naan are to die for. The service is a little slow, but I am under the impression it's because they make your meal to order, from scratch... it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Woodlands for the  buffet this weekend.  I  enjoyed the lunch buffet although it was much smaller than I anticipated.  Also, while everything was very fresh and flavorful it did not offer the variety of items I expected.  I will certainly go back to try dinner and off the menu items to ensure that I get to try the dishes that many friends have said were really great.  As I stated earlier, the buffet was flavorful!  I enjoyed the masala dosa delivered to my table upon request.  The two rice options were good with the vegetarian curries and lentils.  The onion bharji was OK.  The parathas were good.  I really liked the vegetable uthappam.  So good with the sambar.  The noodles were good also.  But I must go back to try other items because I know there are better dishes off the menu! Looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant we visited upon moving to the Charlotte area. We are vegetarians and enjoy hitting a veg-only restaurant once in a while. We have only eaten dinner and have been in about five times now. In our experience the staff is always friendly and the food is tasty.  We particularly like the dosas, which are huge and perfectly crispy. We always eat family style and have tried most of the dishes on the menu. We have enjoyed everything we've tried. They are more than happy to adjust the heat level (spice), depending on your preference.   I've read reviews stating the staff ignores Indian people. My husband and I have not seen or experienced this. Furthermore, the restaurant is often filled with diners who appear to be Indian. In my experience, that speaks volumes about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great South Indian restaurant. The Dosas ( savory crepes) were perfectly crispy. The sambar perfectly spiced."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is my favorite Indian food In Charlotte hands down. I have been to many and this one is my favorite. Some of the reviews say the owner is rude but I have not had that experience. Honestly,  even if I did I would still go back because their food makes me do a happy dance when I eat it. The malai kofta is heaven. The sauces are so rich and delicious. My son and husband love it there even though it is vegetarian and they are major meat eaters. Not fancy decor, just great Indian food."}
{"text":"We ordered many dishes and two dishes were tasting too spicy , so we requested for an exchange but there was the owner who was an Indian lady and she refused to alter the dish for us.. she really had some attitude problem, she never came with the next dish and literally hit the utensils on the table while serving."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing. The decor is horrid but the food makes you forget all about it. And, prices are very low!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks. Great flavor and vegan options a plus plus. Staff is equally as good - they seems very pretty eager to please and were attentive. I would highly recommend (esp for vegetarians and vegans)."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and love it. I don't think I've had anything that wasn't delicious. The butter dosa is my go to dish and is filling!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pesarattu masala dosa and chai. Both were good and met expectations, but did not merit an exceptional 5 rating. Chai could have been hotter (my personal preference) and the chutney with the dosa could have been fine-tuned a bit. (I'm very picky about my coconut chutney.) Overall a pleasant meal. Bollywood music playing lightly in the background. Clean setting, decent service. Recommended."}
{"text":"Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food is fabulous here. Loved the Dosa and the Shezuan rice. The ambiance and the service was really good. The Chinese tasted as delicious. Will be visiting this place more often. Extremely pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a good Indian restaurant for some time now. I've visited several popular places but could never crave a second visit. I found this place through instagram, and I'm so excited that it wasn't a coincidence. As others have mentioned, this place is pretty impressive if you're a carnivore enthusiast. There are so many great, tasty, and filling options that meat seems alarmingly irrelevant.  We went crazy ordering a sh1t ton and everything was very good. They have good Indian beer selection also. Enough said..Def go try them out."}
{"text":"This place is delicious,  I haven't been here in years and visited last week. The food was as good as I remembered but the chick peas were way under cooked. I showed up at 2 pm (not knowing that they closed at 3) and felt rushed. Just go at an appropriate time so your food isn't under cooked and to where you feel you must gulp your food down. Still delicious - just go at a good time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I will never go back the owner lady is so rude she should not be in front taking orders or deal with customers. The food was okay after a long wait but missing authentic flavor they just named it Indian but it's not authentic Indian food coz no body knows the real authentic food should taste and presentation is horrible on top of that arguing owner lady was big no no for me ."}
{"text":"Very very poor service.. ordered a veg Hakka noodles and it was tasteless, so requested for an exchange.. the lady who served was not ready to exchange, irrespective of it we ordered a different dish, she threw the next dish at our table.. seriously a bad attitude..! Spoils ur dine in mood..! Really wish there was a negative star to rate."}
{"text":"It's awesome to be able to walk into a place and know you can eat anything from the menu! This vegetarian Indian restaurant is a jewel of Charlotte. I get something different every time I go. I'm going to work my way through the expanse of a menu in time. The aloo gobi is definitely be at the top of my favorites list so far. The restaurant also caters to large family style gaterings. I'll continue to come back until I've tried everything they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Awesome food specially Chinese and South Indian food. Exact taste of Mumbai, India fast food restaurants. We loved sczhwan rice, manchow soup and paper masala dosa."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  This really is my favorite restaurant!  The lady who runs the place is always really nice.  I can't place a favorite dish because I have so many.  However you can't leave without trying the mango ice cream!  And I personally always end with a cup of the tea :)"}
{"text":"I'd say it's just alright.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  I expected more flavor, but our little bit of everything appetizer tasted all the same.  The curry was mediocre.  I had a bread thingy that was blown up with lentils (don't remember name) that was tasty.  For a vegetarian place, it was as expected."}
{"text":"This weekend, my SO and I decided to give it our first try. Checked the reviews here and was excited about checking it out.  The food is tasty, but the service was very slow and unattentive. I noticed it was every table and not just us, so that was a little comfort. I would try is again, but not go out  our way again to go."}
{"text":"I guess this is the only Pure Vegitarian restaurant in Charlotte..South Indian food is decent..You can give it a try once.."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside scare you, Woodlands is really a great restaurant. Clean and has very tasty authentic food at reasonable prices. Their dosas are amazing! They usually have a $9 buffet on the weekends as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian vegetarian food from South India. In incredible doses, mango Lassi and other healthy  Indian fare. Nice attentive  owners  and great service. Loved this place."}
{"text":"Food: sub par. I ordered my food and they completely forgot my order. I had to remind them and he ran back to make the dish and didn't even apologize. I ordered the scheuzan noodles, it was spicy but nothing special  Service: below average--didn't refill our waters and didn't bring my food out on time (see above). It was also freezing inside, the heater was \"being worked on\" and my entire family had their entire jackets inside the restaurant which made the experience less than positive.   Price: completely overpriced, expect to spend at least $15-20 per person   Bottom line: I don't recommend. Find another Indian restaurant that will have better service for a better price."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE foodie. I love foods of all cultures and I loving finding new gems and trying out different places. I actually found Woodland's through a coworker. She would frequent Woodland's for lunch and I tagged along for what would be one of the best life decisions ever. I've been back close to 10 times and they are CONSISTENTLY amazing! I've gone several times for the lunch special, which comes with 2 curries, samosas, naan and some sort of dessert. It's about $9 and TOTALLY worth it. I've also   been to the lunch buffet about 4 times! It's SO MUCH food for both the lunch special and buffet and I honestly, can't believe I'm saying this, DO NOT MISS THE MEAT! The buffet is constantly changing but there are always a variety of curry, soup and some sort of dessert, among other amazing yummies. If it's your first time, I recommend trying the buffet. It is only on the weekends and for about $11. You'll get to try a variety of food and you'll definitely find something you love!"}
{"text":"We really went all out to try this place. We got the assorted appetizers, two entree's, and bread. Every single thing was even more delicious then the next. Everything had a very unique flavor.   Usually Indian food leaves me feeling heavy, and full. This place I left full and satisfied, but it didn't have a heavy feel to it. Very light, and delicious.   The sauces were great, the appetizers were to die for, the rice was well cooked, and everything was so full of flavor that I often of dreams of the delicious food. I can't wait to go back over and over and over again! Some of the best Indian food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My review was written four years ago, so I thought it was time for an update.  Still solid four stars, bathrooms have been remodeled, many owner changes and currently service is a little slow, but if you know this going in and you are in a good mood you can certainly tolerate it.  We meet at 5p on the dot, order starters and a bottle of wine immediately, but if you don't know this, you might be sitting there a little while.  If you like spicy food be sure to specify because they will tone it down for you.  Especially if you are getting take away tell them HOT or they will write medium down.  Even with crazy service, I don't care, Woodlands remains one of my favorite restaurants in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I tried their curried special for lunch and this is my second visit....great Indian Food"}
{"text":"Ok ok....So, these guys aren't the easiest to find, get to, track down, locate, etc, but the journey far exceeded my expectations. On the outskirts of Eastland, it's not the prettiest area, but I dig the trudgery it took to experience the flavorful onslaught.   It's purely vegetarian/vegan. Not a whisper of meat was found in our food.   Started with the pea/potato samosas and garlic naan. Perfectly executed. The sauces served alongside were lovely. Spicy and pungeant. I'd order these again, but would look forward to trying another variety. The garlic naan was legendary. Chewy, charred in places, and kicked so much flavorful ass.  For entrees, we went with Chana Masala and the Paper Dosa. Masala was absolutely wonderful -- served with jasmine rice. The Paper Dosa.....just look at my photos or anyone else's. It's like a joke. So massive and hilariously served on a medium sized plate. It's a crepe-like bread with a potato mash on the base of the plate and a few dipping sauces. It's one of the most versatile Indian dishes I've experienced. the sheer size of the dish will stick with you for the rest of your life. However, the flavors are wonderful and earthy. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.   Service was efficient, but they did seem to exude the \"you're inconveniencing me right now\" sort of attitude a few times. Not a huge deal, but it did make use the eatpayleave strategy.  Would I go back? Hell yes. Will I get Paper Dosa again? Hell yes. Am I stoked to explore the menu further? Oh....hell yes.   Count me in as a part of the Woodlands fanclub."}
{"text":"I was here over a year ago with my partner and we couldn't remember the name or location because it was before we moved to Charlotte. I'm happy I tracked it down again because I look forward to going back. A full veg Indian restaurant with giant bread, hell yeah! I don't remember what curries we got, but everything was great."}
{"text":"Ate at Woodlands for the first time last night. Wonderful and interesting food, combined with great service. Best Indian restaurant I've found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I have to get any South Indian dish, this is the place to be. Tried bunch of Indian places but woodlands is hands down is my favorite of all. The staff and the owner lady I see most of the time is very nice and welcoming. I will highly recommend to try any kind of Dosa and you will not be disappointed. I will be back very soon, especially after having a really bad experience at Peacock, South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Much as pains a true blue carnivore like myself to give a good review to a vegetarian restaurant, this is one of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte.  It's too bad that it's in the middle of nowhere but there gobi manchurian and chili paneer were both quite good and their channa bhatura was nothing short of stellar."}
{"text":"I live in the area, and I've seen this place a million times. I like Indian food, so decided to give it a try tonight based on Yelp reviews. I ordered the Chana Masala for take out. This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the first thing I noticed was a 100% sanitation rating, which is nice to know. They were busy on the inside, but very nice and friendly as I checked out.  The food was good; I'll definitely go back to try more. This would be a good place to take my NYC friends when they visit."}
{"text":"been to this many times... variety of dosas... chole is the best... veggie fried was just fine, not great...best choice for desi snack and breakfast... service is just ok.. have to wait for the waitress for a very long time..."}
{"text":"I really can't rave enough about this place.  It is so great to find a REALLY top notch Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  I've tried a few of their curries, and while all were great, the Malai Kofta (which I had never had before) really stood out.  It is in the most incredible curry sauce.   While I'm generally not a big fan of Dosas, I must admit that they are really quite good here.  Actually, I've been here four times, and I can't think of anything that ISN''T good.  The lunch menu is quite reasonable, and they have a well-stocked buffet on the weekends.  And those who are vegetarian-wary shouldn't be frightened away: this food is spiced so well, you will not miss the meat (I'm serious).    I guess the only negative is that service gets a little spotty (lack of water refills and lengthy check delivery)--something to be prepared for.  Fortunately, the food more than makes up for these minor deficiencies."}
{"text":"I am blessed to have a lovely boyfriend from Andhra Pradesh who is an EXCELLENT cook. Everyone flips out when he cooks and begs him to cook again. Honestly, I can't stand most Indian food, but he is a magical unicorn in the kitchen. Anyway...the man was starving last night and he wanted to take me to Woodlands.   We ordered idli and vada for appetizers and a dosa and veggie uthappam for the main course. He tried to order something else that he saw on the online menu, but the server, who we assumed as American, had no idea what he was talking about and looked at my bf like he was an idiot. The server was kind of rude and dismissive in general. I've seen worse service, but still...  When the food came, I must say that it looked delicious. It was very well presented and seemed to be very well prepared for what it was. The vada was tolerable. The idli was too heavy. The sambar was not that great, but the coconut chutney almost made me throw up (for an hour after we were done eating). I kept trying to eat, but with every bite I took, I cried to God for mercy. My bf asked if I wanted to order something else. I said only if he was going back to the kitchen to cook it. The dosa was pretty good and the uthappam was alright but I learned that you cannot take your leftovers home unless you want your car to smell horrific after the food cools down on the drive home. We had to stop and throw it out.   I may give this place another try, but I'm pretty sure nothing will beat that man's home cooking.  Three stars for what was probably decent food to other people, minus one for that rude server."}
{"text":"Solid four stars and I will return! At first when my husband and I arrived, there was only one other couple. However, by the time we were finished at least four other parties filled the place.   The food was very flavorful! If you like spice, you'll find it in their dishes. We ordered the wheat bread with potatoes and spices. Fantastic! We also ordered a rice dish with a black lentil dish. Definitely order a few dishes and share; one entree would have been too much of the same flavor. When the dishes came out, the portion size looked small; however, looks were deceiving and we took home leftovers.  The servers were nice and attentive. The atmosphere leaves you wanting, nothing flashy or upscale. The bathroom was clean, but worn for wear.   I wish it were closer to where I live, but I will happily make the drive for some quality Indian cuisine. Definitely check this place out and keep them busy."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food, bad service or a bad experience at Woodlands. I don't get there often as it's 20 mins away from me but somehow it feels further away.  I needed Indian food in my life as well as some veg so Woodlands it was! It's a vegetarian restaurant so expect to dig into noodles, biryani, dosas, and paneer dishes.  We started with my favorite starter; gobi manchurian which is sautéed cauliflower with a whole bunch of garlic, soy sauce, another sauce and green onions. It's large enough to share wit a table of four, which we had.  What I ordered last night was Szechwan noodles that are stir fried with veg and a semi spicy sauce. That was a very large portion. My husband ordered mixed veggie curry which had a great bite to it going down and another curry ordered at the table was mushroom. Love the texture of that one. The show stopper was the Mysore masala dosa. Look it up on their site for a picture. I couldn't get a pic because my dining companion dug in way to fast. It's like a little present! Get some naan and you are in your way to happy town. They also have Indian wine; Sula. It's hard to find so I enjoy that."}
{"text":"I love this place. We have been eating here for many year and we do because we are treated like part of the family. Leslie and Agnes greet us with a smile and welcome us back. While yes many new Indian places have opened in Charlotte over the past 6 years or so I like to stick with the tried and true recipes of Woodlands. Yes I have tried other places and some I even like very much, however when you combine the QUALITY and SERVICE that you receive here that is where the VALUE comes from. I love this place and my family loves this place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for excellent vegetarian, Indian food you MUST visit The Woodlands.  I have never had a bad dish here, whether it was eat-in, took-out or on the buffet.  Mind you, don't come here for the ambiance as this no-nonsense restaurant is meager in terms of the dining space, but who cares when the food is incredible!  Plus, they have many organic versions of their most popular items, appetizers to desserts.  I went back to look at the menu for specific recommendations, but I've never had anything on under \"Curry\" that I didn't love, but I must say their Kadai Bhindi is off the chain!  Oh, and when they say the Vegetable Vindaloo is spicy, they ARE NOT JOKING!  At least two-alarm.  The weekend buffet at LUNCH (they do not have a dinner buffet) is such a deal at $8.95-$9.95.  It's well worth the drive to East Charlotte where folks are just now beginning to figure out how \"true\" the food is at the ethnic restaurants over there!"}
{"text":"Yep, one the best restaurants for completely vegetarian south indian food.  Wife and I grew up in south india and whenever we crave for some authentic south indian food (which we call as tiffin back in india) we go to Woodlands. Like many have said the food is not cheap and unfortunately not many options around the queen city for an authentic tiffin experience.  We have been there few times and was never disappointed with the food.  Service is ok, I mean we see this gentleman every time not sure if he is the owner himself - he immediately seats us and asks if we need water(with or without ice) and takes about 10 mins minimum for another server to come take our order.  Usually no wait (we have been only to dinner) and service is not very fast, a little bit slow even when only a few tables are occupied.  Wife loves the Channa batora ( i do too) and orders that every time we go and I keep changing my entrée. In our recent visit I tried the special spring Dosa - it was good, loaded with veggies and potato masala, big giant dosa cut into 3 rolls, liked it but i was expecting some crunch in the dosa which was missing, probably this version of dosa does not come out as crunchy.  For $10 it was good enough, large portion with enough chutney and sambar.  We also ordered Mixed veg pakora and a plate of vada (which comes with chutney sambar) - both were awesome.  One should definitely try this place if craving for south indian tiffin ;)"}
{"text":"This spot is legit. Delicious vegetarian dishes and a wide array of choices.  I would recommend Woodlands for dinner, as their lunch menu is a bit pricey. Check out their North and South Indian Thalis. They're the Indian equivalent of pu-pu platters, if you grew up eating a lot of American Chinese food. They are a great way to get a lot of variety for dinner.  I highly recommend rasam soup and the chana masala, malai kofta and baigan bartha curries.  This is a great place for groups as they have really large tables to accommodate you. Also, this is a great late-dinner place, as it doesn't really get busy until around 8:30."}
{"text":"I am from San Jose,Ca with a huge Indo-American community and over 100 Indian Restaurants to choose from. I have traveled extensively in India as well. I found the food at Woodlands to be exceptional and of the quality of a fine Indian restaurant but at prices which were more family oriented. If I am ever in Charlotte again I will be sure to have more than one meal there."}
{"text":"Very tasty North indian food Ok south indian dishes.. OK ambiance and location.. Good for vegetarian people like us but there are better indian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food is great but you need to watch your bill closely.  We were never told gratuity was included in our bill.  Chole puri, uttapam and dosa all tasted authentic and great."}
{"text":"It is a relief to go to a vegetarian restaurant.  It is a delight to be offered plain or masala dosa.  If I lived in the area, I might never cook."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great food and great options for vegetarians and vegans. My girlfriend and I are now regulars."}
{"text":"The food is great - my husband and I have been treating ourselves to Woodlands for years as it is authentic and delicious but it's best to get it to go - especially if you're looking for a nice dining experience which includes good service and a nice dining atmosphere. Cheap plastic diner quality glasses filled half way with room temp tap water and no ice, a napkin dispenser instead of cloth napkins and god awful techo music? No thanks. Get it to go and savor the flavor - if you dine at the restaurant, the bad service and lazy decor may distract you."}
{"text":"When I think of Woodlands, two thoughts come to mind.  The first: what the heck is a meatosaurus like me doing eating at a vegetarian restaurant?!?  Yeah, it's that good!  And the second: why didn't I know it was so close to where I lived?  That's a dangerous thing for my pocketbook.  My go-to dishes here are the Paneer Makhani and the Vegetable Makhani.  The spices are so well balanced that you completely forget there's not an ounce of meat in the place.  And the dosas...  absolutely delicious!  My wife has recently gotten into Indian food, so I have a feeling that Woodlands will be a frequented spot for quite a while.  The interior decor is a little dated, and some may look at the location as not the best in the world.  If you're wary about that, they do offer take out."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here this past weekend. We ordered chana masala and another curried type dish, they may have even had the same sauce, which was fine because it was delicious. i'm not one that knows the true authenticity of foreign cuisine, i just know i liked it and i want to eat it again.   It was pretty empty on a Saturday early dinner time, so the service might have been extra attentive. Almost creepy attentive, but not. The one dude would like slowly back away from the table just to be sure he didn't miss us if we decided we needed something, and i could always sense he was standing not too far off watching our table. Still great service.   Too bad it's way on the other side of town for me or we'd probably visit pretty often."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, spicy and simple. Sunday buffet is a deal."}
{"text":"Such a terrible place.. To start with the server was  so not courteous.. Ordered idli and onion rava dosa.. Which was good(though not authentic)but Overpriced! Asked for chutney which should by default come with dosa. But they charged 1.50$ for it."}
{"text":"We were regular patrons of Woodlands @ Maryland and came here yesterday for lunch with lots of expectations.. but sorry, the south indian thali was a big let down.  And the Veg Biriyani was only marginally better.   The biggest shock was when they charged USD 1.50 for a small extra cup of raitha, which was the first time for us. Despite pointing this, they didn't bother to reverse at all.   However even if they had reversed this charge of USD 1.50, I won't bother to come again here as the food is anyways not that great to warrant a travel of 10 miles.   Sorry thumbs down"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge Indian food eaters. He grew up in New York, and is the son of a man who lived a portion of his life in India. We both lived in New York City for some time, surrounded by Curry Hill and it's delicious flavors, and we missed those flavors when moving back to Charlotte, until we found Woodlands. It's the real deal.   We have visited all of the other Indian restaurants in Charlotte, and no one holds a candle to Woodlands. This place has the most amazing paper masala dosas we've tasted. They are huge and quite filling. The curries are excellent, and the desserts are tasty. We have had about half of the curries on the menu, and we haven't had a single one that was bad. The flavors are rich, but not overbearing, and they aren't jammed with sodium. We don't leave feeling thirsty.   If you want to get more bang for your buck, go on Saturday and Sunday afternoons when they have a buffet. They change it up, and offer a TON of food. You won't leave hungry.   A lot of people may steer away from it because it's all the way on Albemarle Road, but we live on the west side of uptown and it takes us exactly 12 minutes to get there by taking I-277. You avoid a lot of the Independence Blvd traffic by taking the Albemarle Road exit.   I assure you, it's worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food I have eaten. I had just moved from India and I was craving Indian food.   So my roommates took me to this place and I felt like I was home. Good paper dosas, the Masala dosa is a home run and try the almond halva you have to ask for it. It's called Badam halva."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Indian food, and have cooked quite a bit as well. Okay, the truth is, I may have a bit of an obsession with Indian food. While I may be kind of (or: really) a wimp in the spice level factor, I could eat Indian food for the rest of my life and be happy.  Try the Chana bhatura - amazing! My fiance and I use it as an appetizer/ side dish to sharing an entree. The dal makhani is amazing. We haven't yet made dal makhani, but after trying Woodlands' version of it, it's next on our list. The paneer makhani is really delicious as well. My fiancé and I have been here half a dozen times and have not once gotten something we've disliked. Definitely worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times so far, twice for dinner and once for buffet. I would say I am quite happy with the food here. I am a vegetarian and since this place is a vegetarian restaurant, I could chose from anything. We ordered Indo-chinese food for the dinner. Pretty delicious. Prices are also reasonable at least, as compared to other Indian restaurants in Charlotte area. Buffet had excellent variety. The biggest surprise was that they would bring freshly made dosas (stuffed with potatoes) at your table. This is unique because I have normally seen only small plain dosas served for buffet. These guys are not very customer friendly though. Don't expect great customer service experience. Go just for the food. I certainly would go here again."}
{"text":"Love Woodlands and bring my parents here when they come to town (Dad has always loved Indian food and Mom is very pro-vegetable). Amazing food and a giant puffy bread that I order instead of naan here and only here.   I do wish the location was a bit different. From outside it doesn't look like much at all and inside is oddly subdued. A better location (and a bit closer to home) and I'd be here a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Why are some Southern-Indian restaurants called \"Woodlands\"?  In the United States, they are usually located in gritty urban environments, far from any forested areas!  This one's actually situated not far from some random clumps of trees, but shabby strip centers and even a demolished mall are more prominent nearby landmarks, rather than any real woodlands.  But enough of that.  Whatever the genesis of its name, this Woodlands is very good.    We went for the weekend buffet.  As advertised on Woodlands' street sign, the restaurant serves \"pure vegetarian\" cuisine.  (I think the word \"pure\" is meant as an extra warning to those folks who, as incredible as it seems in 2014, remain unsure whether fish and even chicken (!) qualify as \"vegetables.\")  The buffet itself isn't that extensive: a couple of soups; a few starchy items like vada, uthappam, and paratha; and four or five veggie items like dal and palak paneer.  This stuff was mostly delicious.  But best of all, you get a complimentary masala dosa.  This was the highlight of the lunch:  It was griddled perfectly, with a nice balance of chewiness and crispness.    Good stuff.  The decor at Woodlands is somewhat dreary--it's dated and dim, but comfortable enough.  Service was efficient but a little stiff."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant 2 years ago and had liked the food, so decided to revisit yesterday. But it turned out to be a bad decision for multiple reasons.  First, the food was nowhere close to authentic Indian food. We had ordered several items on the menu ranging from north Indian cuisine, south Indian cuisine to Indo chinese. None of the food items were flavorful for what they were.   Schzewan rice was very bland - no hint of vinegar or soy sauce or garlic. Samosa chat was dry and soft, the crunch was completely missing.  To top it all, the servers were rude and paid little attention. We had been waiting for one item that we ordered and kept waiting until we could wait no more and decided to leave because of the the main servers asked us to \"empty the table\" as other people were waiting for a table. I have been to several restaurants that have huge influx of diners. But at none of those places you are asked to leave just because there are people waiting while you are still waiting on your order.   In short, I was highly disappointed. I am never coming back again."}
{"text":"Well I can't review the food at all because we were turned away at the door. Now - I am fully aware that we showed up at 2:50 and they close for lunch at 3 and I would have NO PROBLEM being turned away except that a family in right in front of us - literally - was seated. In addition there were two tables of guests who had just received drinks, so they obviously were at the beginning of their meals. The only difference was that we are not Indian and everyone else was. The host was rude and not at all apologetic. Had I been alone I would have been a lot more demonstrative of the fact there I suspected some discrimination. I won't return."}
{"text":"Amazing food! D owner was very courteous and so were the waiters.. Would definitely go there again. No buffet for lunch. But the food was delicious and filling."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent, although other places have better Gulab Jamun. However, the female waitstaff is extremely judgmental and rude. The male waitstaff is incompetent but politer. We will not be returning, even though their Dosas rock.  This is America; don't be soooo surprised to see someone different and judge based on looks. And for the record, my wife is Indian. Had you bothered to look past her appearance you might have caught on."}
{"text":"This is definitely true authentic South Indian cuisine. I went this weekend with my friend who is Indian and we had a great time. The mango lassi is fresh and delicious, and the dosas are the traditional style which come to your table sitting 3 feet wide. Tons of fun to surprise our friends with who aren't used to foods extending past the end of their plates. :)  The spinach samosa starters were excellent, and I loved the dipping sauces that came with them. My boyfriend got the Malai Kofta and he really enjoyed it. I got the South Indian Thali because I really wanted to experience the most traditional form of the South Indian breakfast. The flavors were diverse and delicious, and the \"dessert\" bowl really hit the spot.  Like many places in this area, you don't go there for the ambiance, but rather the authenticity. The interior is very casual but the food is high quality (with many organic options) has zero trans fat and is served in the traditional way.   They automatically add 18% gratuity for parties of 4 or more. I'm a good tipper, so it doesn't bother me. But they didn't tell us this (it's written on the menu) so we accidentally tipped double. I'm definitely not used to that policy starting at 4 people, usually 6. So just be aware.   Don't forget to wash your hands after ordering and before you eat. It's the respectful thing to do."}
{"text":"Food is consistently great! I highly recommend their South Indian fare - the lentil crepes (dosas) or their casual Indian street fare (chaat) items like Dahi Batata Puri or Samosa Chaat."}
{"text":"Watch out if you go with kids for lunch buffet. The owner makes up cut-off ages for child rate on the fly. Food is ok, nothing outstanding. Attitude of the owner is disappointing. Most places have 12 yrs as cut off for kids. And 4 or 5 yrs may be for free kids. I don't mind paying whatever the kids ages. But then do please post the ages. I don't want to stand at the check out and discuss why is she charging me so much!"}
{"text":"Do not let the vegetarian throw you off. A lot of Indian cuisine is vegetarian. I have taken a few meat eaters with me to this restaurant and they loved it, and a couple of them had had Indian food before and hated it. I've since taken them back to this restaurant. It's authentic and delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!! Did not disappoint! Looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Oh my word, do yourself a favor and eat here. As a vegetarian it is very, very difficult to find quality food in the Queen City that I can enjoy... this place takes the cake! From appetizer to entree to dessert, we were very pleased with the presentation, flavor and portion of all the food that we ordered. While the service isn't \"Southern\" friendly, they are polite and get you everything you need in a timely manner. Honestly I prefer it.  A bit of a hole in the wall, but a real gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"After looking at the other reviews about this restaurant, I was not sure if Woodlands would live up to my expectations. But as seen from my review, it really is a 5 Star restaurant. The Chilly Pakoda is what we started with, moved to Assorted Appetizers, parallel-ly having Hayward 5000, an Indian Beer. Chilly Pakoda along with the green chilly sauce can make some people sweat. Hayward-5000 brought India feeling back making me feel I am home (in India). Chole Bature was good and filling, a little more spicy would have made it simply awesome. Dal Tadka was surprisingly without Tadka that was a bummer and Vegetable Pulav was OK-ish.  The service from Christopher was really top class and friendly.   Ending our meal with the Sweet Lassi and Mysore Coffee was like icing on the cake. Since it was raining outside in Charlotte yesterday, Mysore coffee was really amazing."}
{"text":"I change my mind a lot about which Indian restaurant in Charlotte is my favorite, but I think I'm committing to Woodlands. First of all, if you're vegetarian, it's awesome to go to a restaurant where everything is safe. They have an organic menu as well, which is pretty exciting.   The staff is really friendly, and the weekend buffet is amazing. They bring you these Indiany-burrito-like things...I think they're called Dosas. They are stuffed with spiced potatoes, and they rock. They also have this fruit custard, and their rice pudding is incomparable.   The most interesting thing about this buffet is that they have free freakin' wireless. Who would ever have imagined going to an Indian buffet that has wireless? It's such a beautiful, dangerous combination.   They're prices are pretty good as well. I don't remember the cost of the weekend buffet, but it's not bad. During the week, they have some great big plates that you can order for lunch that are all around $7 or $8."}
{"text":"I liked the Sunday buffet (opens at 11:30 am).  It's tucked away in a corner and doesn't look big at first, but once you start examining what's there it's quite a lot.  If you're not sure how to eat the food, just get in line after an Indian and see how he or she puts it together.  You'll need those stainless steel sauce cups for the dipping sauces.  A dosa comes with the buffet. The food is good here, but it's not \"Oh My God!!\" good, you know?  However, the desserts were spot on.  The gulab jamun was the best I've ever had--there was a good balance of the savory cheese and cardamon with the sweet syrup."}
{"text":"This place has the best vegan Indian food around,  I have been coming here for years and the quality of the food is always great.  Try the onion rava masala dosa,  gobi manchurian and palak paneer and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A huge thanks to Julia S and Tonya P for turning me on to this place. I'm ashamed I hadn't written this review earlier, this place is fantastic. Despite my love for Indian food, I can never remember the names of anything I eat, so I'm just going to say that it all tastes great. Especially the curries. And the dosas. And the naan. And the samosas. I am so hungry, let's go back please.   Don't mind the location and decor. Service is great and food is delirium inducing."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch. Food was good but the service was less than average. Overall good food with average service and some loud  music."}
{"text":"okish place with average food and service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Rudest owner. For the food we get there, we might as well go somewhere else where We get a good whole experience. Nothing special! Not going back!"}
{"text":"First things first, the lunch buffet is no more (fire code or something). Don't worry. For two people the special meal #4 with some naan is like having a buffet at your table!! Soup, three apps, dal, masala, two curries, rice, and deserts. Works out to be $11/person. Everything was delicious and I enjoyed eating new things that I might have passed up on the buffet just to double up on some old faves. I will definitely be back - always in two's!!!"}
{"text":"My husband is picky when it comes to Indian Food & I trust his judgement. We both enjoy this restaurant! We've tried several different things &  each item never disappoints.   My husband went for some take out the other day & the owner struck up a convo with him. They also have him some free tea while he waited on his food:).   The only complaint is the decor is a bit outdated."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I've been to in the Charlotte area.  What they may lack in ambiance (it is relatively spartan, although they do decorate for Christmas by hanging ornaments from the ceiling), they make up with their huge menu options that are prepared quickly and deliciously.   I appreciate that they serve the classics (palak paneer, malai kofta, etc), but also uthappam (think a pancakey pizza) and even some of the less seen southern Indian items, such as dosa (those comically EMORMOUS crepe-looking things you sometimes see, but never know what it is called so you never order. Yah, those).   The food is consistently tasty, well-spiced, and decently priced. And vegetarians rejoice--you can't go wrong as it is all meatless!  Plus, they have fantastic gulab jamoon for dessert--deep fried doughy cheese balls in rose water. Nom nom nom!!!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian food ... Especially South Indian. The Assorted Appetizers were our favorite with the veg pakoras being the star!!! Onion Uthappam and Pav Bhaji tasted good too. Service was average, and prices value for money. Everything is worth it for the authentic food quality and taste."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice staff. The atmosphere is relaxed and it is a nice place to come for good, healthy food with your family and friends. I love the veg vindaloo with chapati soo yum!"}
{"text":"So this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  It's all about the vast options of menu items and the quality of the food.  The flavors are amazing.  There were five of us and we ordered different things so that we could all sample a lot of different foods.  The Indian cheese was spectacular and had just the right amount of zesty spice.  The Indian pancake with veggies was also amazing. And oh the fried rice with veggies was delicious.  If you are into vegetarian fare, this could be your place.  Although I like chicken and fish, I could grow accustomed to eating just vegetables IF the flavors were as robust as here.  This restaurant is definitely off the beaten path.  If it were in South Park, it would be swamped with a line coming out the door.  But this Albemarle Road eatery offered a quiet space with a nice ambiance.   They could probably update the restaurant a bit, but it was clean and the focus is not the art on the walls or the color scheme, it is the food.  At exactly 9:30 pm as we were still yipping and yapping, someone came to our table and asked us to leave.  That was s little bit off putting, as their posted hours are 5 pm to 10 pm on Saturdays. I guess we had overstayed our welcome.  Hmmmm.  It sort of made me realize that the server could have been more friendlier during our dining experience.  She did her job, but exuded NO warmth.  This is why I am giving 4 stars and not 5.  I still want to go back to try some other dishes.   It would take about twenty visits to feel like you had tried at least a majority of their menu items. Again, I have not had a better Indian meal in all of Charlotte and I have tried a lot of them.   If you go to Woodlands, just make sure you are finished and prepared to exit the place by 9:30 sharp.  And I do mean SHARP!"}
{"text":"EXTRAMLY pricy indian restaurant I have ever seen in the Charlotte area. For regular entrees cost over 17 dollars like malai kofta,  paneer dishes etc. SAMBHAR is so watery and lack of taste. NAAN also very pricy.  I would better go somewhere well else and eat same taste and dishes less pricy. Money and food not worthy."}
{"text":"Vegetables, glorious vegetables!! Your Mom would be so proud that you went to Woodlands and you ate your veggies! Well, it is a vegetarian Indian restaurant so you kinda' have to... But here's the good news. Everything is delicious!  Have you ever eaten a piece of bread/crepe, stuffed with spiced potatoes and onions that is 3 feet long and six inches wide? Would you like to? Then order the amazing Butter Masala Dosa (and bring a tarp and machete so you can wrap the leftovers).    The vegetable Samosas are fried pockets of yumminess that come with nice tart, vinegary tamarind and mint chutneys. If you are brave and want to know what it's like to have your face melt off your skull (in a good way), try the Chili Pakora - chick pea battered, deep fried jalapenos  - the heat is addictive!! Feeling adventurous? The Gobi Paratha is sooo unique and good - whole wheat bread stuffed with cauliflower and potatoes.    The Baigan Bartha was by far my favorite- Mashed eggplant cooked with tomato, onions and spices - like eating a big bowl of eggplant butter!! Wash it all down with a crisp, dry Kingfisher and your mouth now officially loves vegetables!! Nicely done Woodlands! Solid Four Stars!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit. Food was very tasty. We had North Indian, South indian Thali & Veg. Biriyani. Everything was awesome. A touch spicy, but that's what Indian food is all about. Authentic Indian taste. Only thing that's missing was the service. A good service and it would have been a 5* without a doubt.  My verdict:  Awesome, Authentic Indian (South) food with a very average service."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in Charlotte. The Indian lady who attends to the customers is so rude and literally throws the plate in the table as though we have come for some free food. But the other lady was so nice and courteous. I'm not sure if the Indian lady is the owner or just a manager, she needs to learn how to treat people. Will never come back. Google reviews about this place says it all. Bad that I missed checking google reviews before thinking to go to this damned place.   Food taste is not good either. I am from south India and I can't even call them as a South Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Wow.  OK, this is one of only two Indian restaurants I've found so far in Charlotte where the food tastes authentic.  We went there for dinner hungry and tried several things -- the appetizer sampler, which came with three different chutneys and sambar, and then channa masala and pongal avial as the main courses.  Everything was delicious, but the samosa on the appetizer plate was a highlight, as was the carrot pudding that we shared for dessert.  The pongal was super-traditional, just like something you'd get at a casual family dinner.  What we ordered was way too much food for two but I'm sure it will make great leftovers.  Albemarle Rd. isn't much for atmosphere, but the restaurant itself is pleasant."}
{"text":"Very good buffet.  I went here for Sunday lunch buffet. I am delighted to having tried such a nice vegetarian buffet. All their chutneys are great. Masala dosas are delicious and small uttappam were great. Sambhar was fantastic. I really enjoyed their buffet.  I was surprised to find vadas. After long time I have eaten vadas. Vadas with sweet red chutney and mint chutney was epic.  The price is perfect for the number of items they had on the buffet. They had some varieties in vegetable curries. I tries baigan ka bhartha. Loved it.  I would go again to this place although it's too far for me. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"My home girl Elizabeth A. loves, like totally BFF4LIFE LOVES this place so I've been to Woodlands many a time celebrating her birth or us surviving another work week - honestly, she loves this place many many times over so we go when the diets are thrown to the wind and we're looking for an excuse to get down the ground on some grub.  Being an Indian food idiot/novice, I can't tell you a whole lot of what I've tried on their lunch buffet (it's always changing!) but I can tell you that about 90% of it is amazing, followed by 10% of it which is pretty good.  The naan? MMMM. That's right - 4 M's. Carbs, freshly cooked (fried? please god don't let it be fried) and available to scoop up your rice and whatever cheese, chicken, spinach, potato, eggplant stuff you've put on your plate along the buffet - seriously, this naan stuff is NO JOKE. Good bye, garlic bread! Don't call me Parker House rolls! I have a new carb fave in town and it's Woodland's naan. I love thee!  Moving on to the random list of stuff I don't know the name of, I simply say: Girl, don't take it personal. I love you - like, forreal! And while I wouldn't buy this crapola from a dude trying to hustle me for my lovin', I hope that you know that I am true and love all of you. Variety is the spice of life, and lunch buffet, you always got me hooked like that. Everytime I go it's something new to experience and you got me twisted up in your Indian game.  If my review/hip hop montage doesn't make you want to go to Woodlands, I am concerned about your reading skills and/or knowledge of late 90's R&B and kindly request you download \"Pony\" and proceed directly to Saturday's lunch buffet @ Woodlands!"}
{"text":"My friend Laura and I went here tonight and I'm super excited to be her new Woodlands friend! We got there at 5:00 and had the whole place to ourselves. We ordered way too much food and I do not regret it. We started off with samosas and vegetable pakora. The samosas were incredible!! Some of the best samosas I've ever had. The vegetable pakora were not bad, but they seemed to lack something. Maybe they should have been crispier? I still ate them. :-)  For our main dish, Laura got a North Indian  thali and I got the Mysore Masala Dosa with garlic naan. I could eat that garlic naan every day. The dosa was good, but it was my first dosa and I didn't really know how to eat it. I will definitely be going back! Excited to try the mixed vegetable curry next time!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, and I have to admit, I have not really eaten at many vegetarian places.  However, I do LOVE Indian food, and this place came highly recommended by a friend.  After two trips to Woodlands, I can say that I don't miss the meat when I come here.  In true Indian restaurant fashion, the smell of the spices and curry permeated throughout the restaurant.  The inside is painted a peach-like color.  Hindu decorations and paintings adorn the walls.  However, the decor is simple.  The staff is friendly and reasonably attentive, even when the restaurant is packed.  While it's maybe not the quickest place, our food has come out hot and fresh each time.  Their prices are very reasonable, with many entrees less than $10 at dinner time.  And now, on with the food I've had:  Samosas: Crispy crust on the outside, plenty of flavorful filling on the inside.  These are not too salty, but plenty of great seasoning.  While these are not the best I've ever had, they're pretty solid.  (4/5)  Garlic naan: The naan I've always had has been soft and fluffy.  However, both times I had it here, it's thinner and a little crisp on the outside.  The garlic flavor is more subtle than at a lot of places, but still good.  I think the crisp texture holds up a little better for loading it with food, so I really like it.  (4.5/5)  Chana Masala: Great spices, and I like the chickpeas. (4/5)  Vegetable Jalfraeze: I absolutely loved the vegetables in this, and this sauce highly flavorful as well.  (4.5/5)  Palak Paneer:  This reminded me of saag that I used to get at an Indian place back home.  It's more of a mild dish, but the spinach and the cheese are wonderful in it. (4/5)  Malai Kofta:  This is, so far, the best thing I have eaten here.  The sauce is a little more creamy, mildly sweet.  The dumpling is AMAZING, although I only got three medium-sized ones in the dish. (5/5)  Paneer Makhani:  Again, the cheese is so delicious in this dish, but there is just never enough in it.  The tomato-based sauce was very good and decently spicy. (4/5)  Mango Lassi:  I have never had one that had such a fresh, strong mango flavor to it.  Very delicious.  (5/5)  There are still so many things I want to try here.  I have seen their Dosas, and that is next up on my list.  Their food is flavorful and spicy, but not overly hot (unless you request that, I believe).  Overall, I'd rate them a solid 4.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"A solid option for South Indian food in Charlotte. Decor is sort of below average; I feel like this place should decide whether it is going to be a hole-in-the-wall or an upscale Indian place. Right now, it's sorta straddling the line and it shows. Don't get me wrong, I love hole-in-the-wall restaurants, but you gotta choose one and commit, dang it!  My dining companion and I ordered the appetizer sampler to share; it came with a variety of chutneys and a whole shitload of deep-fried things. I could immediately identify the samosa, pakora and vada, but I was mystified as to what else was on the plate and it was not explained by our server. Luckily, my friend was of Indian descent, so he was able to explain a few more of the items on the plate, but that left us guessing at the remainder. They were all very good, but it would have been useful to know of the deep fatty-fryness we were getting ourselves into.  The garlic naan was spectacular - a thin variety, but very soft and perfectly seasoned. I ordered the Baigan Bartha (mashed eggplant with tomatoes, onion, and spices) and it was very good. Subtle blend of spices were balanced very well with the dominant eggplant flavor, while the tomato and onion flavor managed to stay appropriately in the background.   So, yeah, I'd love to come back. I REALLY wanted to try a dosa and see how it stacks up to some of my favorite Indian restaurants/food trucks in L.A., but I was in the need of something healthier. Next time. Also, a friend really loves their buffet, so I'd like to see if he knows his stuff. Cuz, if not, I am sooo going to rub it in his face."}
{"text":"I had been to Woodlands once before tonight but it was years ago so I didn't remember much about it.   Tonight was with one of my dinner groups and we were all basically in the same boat, we didn't know what to order.  So we started ordering a little of everything in the appetizers and every single one of them had their own unique flavor.   We continued on with the entrees.  One of our group had recommendations from coworkers on what to order so most of us went with those.  All of the flavors were wonderful from the vegetable curries to the chickpea and potato entries to the the noodle dinners.  And the bread..wow.  The breads alone would make a meal.  Such unique flavors in the breads.  And the breads were HUUUUUUUGGGGGEEEEEE!   Ok, some of it was puffed air.  But still.    Who would have thunk that 6 meat eaters (and a vegetarian) would enjoy this restaurant so much.     Thank you Woodlands for enlightening me on the flavors of India!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian Restaurant in Charlotte. Very courteous waitress and super nice owner. The Saturdays lunch buffet looked pretty legit, however we wanted to order off the menu instead because I particularly wanted the huuge paper dosa and my friend wanted to get specific dishes that reminds her of the dishes she had back home.   My paper dosa was AWESOME, presentation wise haha. It came huge and even as the waitress was taking it out, she couldn't help but to laugh a little. We got to the restaurant early so it was just us and one other table, the guy at the other table looked at it and laughed too. I did not mean to cause so much attention, embarrassing haha. The filling of he dosa was awesome, potato, curry, peas...the paper dosa itself was a bit hard to eat and was kind of blend after a while.   My friend's stuffed potato pancake was so juicy and tasty. I also ordered the garlic naan, which i thought was a tad overcooked. We also ordered the scallion pancake, that was pretty huge, filled up a whole large plate, but i'd say that was like a 3/5.  Overall, the portions here are very generous. Lunch buffet is around $10. I'd say price range wise this restaurant is 2/4 dollar signs.   It is a tad dark in the restaurant and it has VERY heavy indian spices smell, make sure you are ok with that. They have booths and tables. Cleanliness looked pretty ok. Bathroom is acceptable as well.   I am definitely looking forward to coming back to try out the lunch buffet...I wish it was a bit closer to town...but still worth the drive! There are also a bunch of ethnic and vegetarian restaurants in the area, if you get a chance, do some exploring!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Palak Paneer (spinach with cheese) for dinner, and it was like most other Palak Paneers I've had in the past - nothing too special.  It came with rice.  My main reason for giving it 3 stars (instead of more) is that the service was a bit slow and the portions were not very substantial for a dinner meal (especially for the price).  Would I go back?  Maybe for the buffet, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"We LOVED the malai kofta here. Really amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes. We were dissapointed in the appetizers though, they use a sort of fluffy batter that is a bit strange. We've noticed this at a few Charlotte Indian restaurants. Seems like a cheap Cisco brand of batter or something. Anyway, would give 5 stars if they improve on that. Skip fried apps, go right for the main meal here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is consistently a delicious restaurant. Yes, it is in a strange location, but this is by far one of the best places to go to if you are eating with vegetarians.  The buffet is my personal favorite option because they have SO many choices and everything is fresh.   Take a Vegetarian here. He/She will love you forever."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! I definitely recommend going for the lunch buffet on the weekend for a sampling of many dishes, especially if you are new to Indian food or to the restaurant. Some dishes are, of course better than others, but overall the food is quite delicious. I would imagine non-vegetarians would enjoy this restaurant as well, for it's bold, complex flavors. I was there around 2 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed, which is always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it an A-Ok.    There was a couple of curry sauces, very spicy - which I know for a lot of people is a great thing.   There was a potato patty with veggies in it which was good.  The tamarind sauce was good, as well.  I came here with Taste of the World and the owners and staff were very welcoming and friendly and gave us a lot of food to try & I can't remember it all.  It wasn't to my tastes, but the people I was with were definitely enjoying it and I recommend people try it for themselves."}
{"text":"The whole family loved it!  Super tasty everything and they could handle food allergies w no problem!  We will be making the 30 min drive often!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!!!! This is the best place in Charlotte. Make sure you get the woodlands special"}
{"text":"The Chana Masala and the Paneer were definitely some of the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in eating authentic Indian cuisine. I knew this ahead of time but the only downside is that this place is completely vegetarian."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!! I am late in writing in this review but I did want to get the word out there on this restaurant.  I have visited this place a few times and it was pretty good, however I went a couple of weekends ago & OMG the food was so nasty I felt I wasted $40 on Sunday buffet.  There was no salt, spices, flavor, or color in anything.  When you know what true Indian food tastes like and you end up eating something so tasteless, you wonder if the chef even tasted the food.  Not only that, but these people give you warm water and you have to ask for ice....what place does that? Not only that, it was a hot Sunday when I went and there was no A/C in that place. Charging $11 for buffet, you are telling me you can't afford ice & A/C...REALLY?!!! I read recent reviews on this place & no disrespect to anyone's taste buds but being Indian and knowing what the flavors should be this place DOES NOT meet the standards.  Please enjoy other places like Bombay Grille, Blue Taj, Persi or anything other that Woodlands.  If you give this place a chance, you're optimistic you'll get good food or you have a craving for Indian food and this is the closest place to you."}
{"text":"I tried out Woodlands on the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a vegetarian) with a group of girls on President's day as we all had it off of work. I'll be honest - I've not had great experience with Indian food, but this restaurant completely changed my mind. It was literally the best pure vegetarian food I've ever eaten. We decided to get the full experience and share a bunch of dishes around the table. Here's a list of what we ordered:   Appetizers  Samosa Chaat - chopped samosa topped with wheat crispies, yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney - this was literally the best item I had at lunch. It was the perfect blend of texture and flavor and set the bar high for the rest of our meal.   Dahi Batata Puri - cripy dough topped with yogurt, potatoes and chutney - very delicious but also quite rich.   Lunch  Pesarat Masala Dosa - green lentil crepe - this came out looking like a huge pancake, and it was almost as delicious. The dipping sauces were quite good and gave the crepe a bit more flavor.   Chana Batura - large puffy bread (think elephant ear with no cinnamon/sugar) with chana masala (chickpeas in delicious sauce) - great item for someone who has never tried (or says they don't like) Indian food. It had great seasoning but wasn't too spicy. The bread was great with everything we had on the table.   Palak Paneer - spinach and home made cottage cheese with tomatoes, onions and spices - my second favorite thing we ordered - I paired it with the puffy bread just to change things up a bit. That puffy bread is good with everything.   Gobi Manchurian with gravy - marinated cauliflower sauteed with ginger, garlic, green onions and soy sauce - the sauce was absolutely divine.   Gobi Paratha - whole wheat bread stuffed with cauliflower, potatoes and spices - this was my least favorite item we ordered as it was very spicy (even though the menu says \"mildy spiced\"). It was still good...but something had to be my least favorite, and this was it.   Parking was not a problem and it's not too far from uptown. The food has no trans-fat and there is an organic menu available. Tables don't turn over very quickly, so the restaurant seemed full the entire time we were there. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back soon to try out some new dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious! Super vegan friendly and willing to modify to make make dishes vegan. Super appreciate their patience."}
{"text":"I was really worried when I moved to Charlotte that I wouldn't be able to get my South Indian fix. Luckily with a Woodlands here, I know I'll be taken care of. Pretty much all your basic south indian fare. Dosa, uttapam, idly, sambar, rasam, etc. Delicious all all veg.   Don't let the all veg scare you, I love meat and eat lots of it, but what woodlands helps you realize that a meatless meal if done as well as they do is just as satisfying."}
{"text":"There is little argument that Woodlands is some legit Indian food, and vegetarian to boot. Not a sign of meat in the place in all the years I've been coming.  The menu can be a tad intimidating because there are plenty of fine choices - just pick one and dive right in. Don't like it? choose another. Prices are not bad, by any stretch of the imagination. Dined the other day with my wife, Will and Jenny H and came away with a completely reasonable bill. And Tonya P was at the next table. Tough to beat that sort of crowd.  For those bread-lovers in the crowd, you are sure to find something. Loads of naan, and the garlic is a perennial contender. The dosa is also a winner, often for presentation, but it also offers a nice alternative to the naan because it's a bit on the lighter side, and gives a nice way to eat those yummy veggies in wrap form.  Curries are served with basmati rice, which can seem on the small side, until  you realize that they will bring more, all you have to do is ask.  The unfortunate issue is that service is just this side of horrendous. They are friendly enough, but getting their attention can be a challenge. It makes for a nice time to chat with your dinner companions, but getting a refill (drink, rice, etc) does not come quickly."}
{"text":"The good news: completely vegetarian. No meat here... Gluten free options.  The bad news: completely vegetarian. High prices. All in all, I liked the Chana masala, noodles, and fried rice. However, I thought the portions were small and the prices were high especially for lunch. I think I will keep looking for better Indian food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am all about trying new cultures' cuisines and Woodlands knocks their food out of the park.   I work just down the street so my coworkers and I often go for lunch. They have a great special that offers 2 curries, rice, a samosa, and a rice pudding. I always tend to order the Malai Kofta and it's amazing! Order it with a side of the garlic or onion naan and your day will be perfect."}
{"text":"I have tried just about everything on the Woodland's menu. The food is very good.  Recommended dishes are the rava dosa and idli.   I recommend the weekend lunch buffet before going for dinner.  You can try the sampling of food before you go for dinner.  Dosa is also including in the buffet.    Service at this restaurant is terrible.  Even when they are not full, waiters are slow.  The food is slow to arrive.  Terrible communication between wait staff and kitchen staff.  This is why I go during the lunch buffet.  Fine place for dinner but be ready to tolerate some slow service."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I love the samosas for my appetizer. I usually get the Dal Mahkhani it's great and spiced perfectly. Sometimes I switch it up and choose the spring dosa which is a generous amount, I always have some left for a to go box. The service is usually pretty good. They also have a pretty good weekend buffet."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I lived right down the street from this place for 4 years and never even thought about going inside.  Then one day we were looking for some place to to try and found some reviews on yelp and figured we would give it a shot.   We were not disappointed at all!  The food is fantastic!  I am as far from a vegetarian as anyone could be, but the flavors they get in their curry is fantastic!  We almost always get #14 with pees, and I recommend everyone try it at least once....sooooo tasty!"}
{"text":"Really bad food(Me and my friend ordered 2 appetizers and 2 Entrées and everything  tasted bland) and bad service. WAS MY FIRST VISIT AND I'M SURE IT WILL BE MY LAST) To the lady at the front desk try to learn some etiquette. Please do not behave as if you are serving people for free and seeing the reviews its clear that she treats Indians with no respect at all. I wonder how this restaurant has got a 4 star rating on yelp."}
{"text":"This place as absolutely outstanding.  The food was wonderful, and the staff was very nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Best Vegetarian Indian Food!   I had the mutter paneer and poori lunch special with hot spice. It was perfectly spiced, the sauce was creamy and smooth and the paneer had the perfect texture. The rice was piping hot and perfectly cooked. The star of the show was The Poori! SIMPLY AMAZING!!!   As a bread lover, Poori is the first thing I look for on an Indian menu.  Much to my dismay, lots of Indian restaurants focus on Naan, which I adore too, in a second-place-option-gotta-eat-it-'cause-they-don't-have-poori kind of way. Not only does Woodlands do Poori, they do Poori well. Big fluffy Poori with the perfect, signature chewy texture, hot and fresh from the oil.   It was the perfect marriage of the mutter panner, poori and rice that won me over completely.  In terms of speed of service, I'm a person who doesn't mind waiting for quality. But if you're impatient, allot more time. After all this isn't fast food, it's good food, done right.    The service wasn't what we as Americans may think of as \"Over the Stars Amazing\". But our server was very polite, kind and attentive, The interior is spotless and smells clean. I will admit the decor is a little dated and not very Indian other then the color palette and gorgeous statue of Ganesh, but seriously who cares.  I'd rather have awesome food in a clean environment over striking decor any day.    As a native of Charlotte,  This is on my list of the best places to eat in Charlotte hands down!"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Good north and South Indian food. I have had uttapam, onion masala dosa, chole batura and every thing tasted really good. Vegetarians get a kick out of this place :-)"}
{"text":"Woodlands has been on my list for many years, and my husband and I finally made a point to visit them one Saturday.  They are certainly not close to us, but the food is delicious, and it was worth the drive.   We started with the Paneer Tikka, a grilled appetizer with onions and green peppers, topped with a spicy sauce.  Persis's version of this dish had a bit of an edge over Woodland's, as the latter's version didn't have as many grilled vegetables, and the Paneer wasn't quite as flavorful.    For our entrees, we both had thalis, which are hard to dine here in CLT.  My husband had the South Indian version, and I had the North Indian.  The Southern version was spicier than the Northern one, but the Northern version had items I'm more familiar with.  I also could choose two curries on the Northern version.   Both were excellent.  We love variety, and the small cups were just perfect for trying lots of different dishes.  And they were incredibly filling, too.  They came with bread--his with roti, and mine with a choice--as well as rice, raita, and dessert.    Service was efficient and helpful.  While it's a long drive for us, I expect we'll both be in the mood soon for another thali from Woodlands."}
{"text":"I work in the nearby area, and Woodlands has been on my to-try list for awhile. A co-worker and I decided to give Woodlands a go for carry-out for lunch one afternoon. We both ordered the paper masala dosa, and it was super delicious. The folks at Woodlands thoughtfully packed the dosas separate from the fillings to prevent it from becoming soggy. The only thing that didn't quite work for me was the chutney. The flavor was good, but it was very thin and soupy in texture. As mentioned in the other reviews, this dosa is massive and we easily could have split it. Who doesn't like leftovers though, right?"}
{"text":"Went here a for a family dinner and had a great dinner! The paper masala disable is massive and super filling! It's nice and crunchy - exactly what I want out of my dosa! Extremely authentic dishes! Wish they have me more sambhar to match the size of the dosa. Service was ok - food came out super fast!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night, had tried to got here many times ,always in that area on Tuesdays when they are closed. My husband is South indian and had been looking forward to it and well we were not completely disappointed but it could have been better and not so expensive.I had the Aloo Goci and it was tasty but there are no bell peppers in India and never in that cusine. It was more like a tikka masala sauce came with rice it was 9.95 for a small serving. My husband had a full meal with soup, vada and a dosa. He said soup was not very good but the vada was ...sambar so-so and the dosa was good but nothing special. I also had Aloo Paratha and it was again just good. Add two sweet teas to this and it was 36.00 a little pricey for a small amount of veggies."}
{"text":"I had a really exceptional experience for my carry out and first time trying this restaurant.  I had it bookmarked for awhile and was in the area, so decided to get lunch.  It wasn't busy on a Saturday early afternoon, so I was able to get in and out pretty quickly.  The man who took my order was very friendly.    I ordered the paneer butter masala..medium heat and garlic naan.  It was so delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They had a huge variety of vegetarian items that I'm excited to try.  (It's vegetarian only). I may go for a little more spicy next time, but other than that I was quite pleased with my selections."}
{"text":"So I have to admit that I am an Indian food snob. I went to school in NYC and ate on 6th street (aka Curry Row) 2 to 3 times a week, because it was cheap and tasty. Once I got a job and had a little cash to spend, I scoured Queens for the best buffets and samosa stands. I'm a little nuts about Indian.  That being said, this is one of the reasons I'm culinarily comfy in Charlotte. Better than 90% of the Indian I've eaten, it's reasonably priced, traditionally spiced, has a fascinatingly diverse menu (Dosa's are amazing, and so are the curries! Their Szchecuan dishes taste like high-end chinese! CRAZY), and a sweet, if tho often harried, waitstaff. Very importantly: they trust you when you ask for \"very spicy\". If you tell them fry-me spicy, it comes out fry-me, crying, happy spicy. I can't tell you how often this is NOT the case, although my fellow Indian food snobs will understand how frustrating this can be.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands-down."}
{"text":"The weekend all-you-can-eat lunch buffet  offers great value. There is a vast variety of food to choose from (South Indian, North Indian, Indo Chinese).  I look forward to next visit here."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with the place, food, ambience, staff and services. They were extremely accommodating for my picky food choices- without compromising on the quality. I'm going to be a regular here!!! My group and I were so much into food that we didn't click pictures- just dug right into the food. Well, shall post pictures next time on. We had ordered dosas, rice, schezwan and manchow soup."}
{"text":"I had been there for a take out of North Indian Thali. Well, the food was ok. Naan is too hard to even chew. And curries were having the same base with different veggies. And, the Dal was the only thing I liked and ended up having with rice. Overall, this thali is so pricy. They mention it is gluten free and organic, Well most of our south Indian is gluten free or vegan. We have been cooking since many years and our ancestors have followed that , and so does we. Also, the thali was so over-priced for $21.00. I hope there was atleast quality in the meal which was provided. I have had better Thalis and south Indian (so called vegan/gluten free/organic) food for a lesser price i New york city and NJ.  Also the attitude of the Lady who is the Host is apparently doesn't give any respect. While taking the order as well, she did not provide me the details of food options available. The only thing I am thankful is for holding the thali I ordered until 3pm."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I needed to refuel after Ikea before making the drive back up to Durham and decided to indulge in a type of food that we can't really get back home: delicious vegetarian Indian!  Taking the advice of previous reviewers, we ordered a Masala Dosa (excellent!  especially when combined with the slightly sweet coconut sauce that came on the side).  Since we had four people we also ordered the Paneer Tikka, Poori Bhaji, Aloo Gobi and the garlic naan.    The Paneer Tikka was delicious and that was a surprise bc normally I don't like Paneer anything.  This paneer was spicy and hot off the grill, with a cilantro, jalapeno, mint sauce that gave it an extra kick.    The Aloo Gobi and garlic naan are my go-to Indian dishes and having them here at Woodlands was a brand new experience.  A depth of flavor and subtlety I had never experienced before.   Really, I think all other Indian food may be ruined for me after this place!  So, I think you can tell by my effusive praise that this place has great food.  They also have friendly employees but were obviously understaffed on a busy Saturday night (almost all the tables full at 8pm).  Our waiter forgot about our order of paneer until we reminded him and we never got our dessert at all.  I am also a bit of a clean freak and the bathrooms needed some attention in the mopping department...  Since the food was so good I can overlook all that.  If Charlotte weren't outside my driving-while-hungry-range I would be back here every weekend!  If you live in Charlotte, please go have a Dosa for me!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on yesterday with some co-workers.  My first time eating vegetarian indian food and everything was delicious!  We had the cutlets for starters, then I had the Chana Poori and ended with the Mango Lassi.  Everything was seasoned well, not too spicy, and good size portions.  Servers were very nice and attentive.  The owners came over and checked how we enjoyed everything.  Great experience, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had homemade Indian food and I was looking for a place where I could get some. After reading reviews I came here and ordered the North Indian thali with mutter paneer and palak paneer. It was delicious! Great price and great portions it was enough for 2 people. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food but RUDEST Host(owner) Ever... served burnt food and said we asked for it... FYI... we asked for crispy Dosa not Burnt.... It seemed that she did a favor on us by serving us food.... Dosa was never replaced...."}
{"text":"On all my trips to India,  I never once had food THIS good!   Whenever I get near Charlotte I alway come here as I live almost 2 hrs away.   When friend or family needs a ride to the airport, I'm the go to person so I can eat here.    This time I ordered the lunch special of butter masala dosa with the savory donut things plus ordered vegetable samosas.  Too much food, had to take most of the dosa home (what s shame! !)  As always,  service was excellent, food worth the long drive, and again I have left full and wondering why this place is soooo much better than any other Indian restaurant I've eaten at.  Can't say enough wonderful things about the tastiness of every dish I've ever had here.  Please don't miss this amazing little gem of a restaurant even if you're not into Indian food.  You will be after a single dining experience!"}
{"text":"I went here today for Christmas lunch. We were so grateful they were open! I believe this is one of the few places in Charlotte you can find a Thali. Also, everything is vegetarian, which is pretty cool too.   Everyone was very nice and the food was served very quickly! Our Thali was very good. We had a spinach curry and a chick pea curry, rice pudding, another curry, garlic naan, fried bread, soup, and even more bread. We got their largest Thali to share, and it was definitely big enough for the both of us. Everything had good flavor, and we definitely left full.   I will go here again for another Thali for sure!"}
{"text":"Woodlands is my go-to for some soul satisfying South-Indian food! My favorite is the mysore masala dosa (indian style crepes coated with a spicy sauce, filled with potatoes), followed by the south indian thali (which gives you the opportunity to try many different dishes) The dosas are always crispy and delicious (delicious partly because of the high sodium levels - hey, no one said the food was healthy! :) ) and of all the items in the 'thali', I love the rasam - it's equal parts tangy as spicy! the hubs loves the north indian thali; it's a great way to sample some really good north indian food. I'd recommend Woodlands to anyone looking for a wide range of delicious vegetarian food! It's a simple restaurant, service is quick and the food always tastes fresh. They can up the level of spiciness if you request it, and they're not kidding if you ask for your food to be spicy! :)"}
{"text":"The lady at the front desk has an attitude. Food is ok. Not great stuff worthy of a 20 min drive.. bad service. Ok Ok food. I have had buffets here, and they are useless.  There are many restaurants in Charlotte which are waaaay better for the price and service. There are a few things good on the menu - the south indian platter - but not sure if you would like all what is served in it. We had the masala mysore dosa - which was literally floating in OIL and the know-it-all lady said, \"No, this is how it is.\"   I am from South, I eat dosas for breakfast and dinner and have been eating for 27 years! Are you kidding me? No acknowledgement, nothing. She had to prove that she was right. I am never going back to this restaurant. I also had the gobi manchurian - waay salty and hard as rocks! Really man? Can't even bite into that thing. I have repeatedly given this place a chance, 4 times so far, and never has it been good. Will not go here. Too many options at Charlotte where food is better, cost is lower, service is better."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is great. So nice to see vegan Indian food. My only suggestion would be to make slightly larger portions. However, I have heard that the weekend buffet is abundant...I just have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Always get attentive service despite being crowded many times.   Also most dishes are flavorful and taste is consistent.   Highly recommend - rasam, any Dosa and utthapam.  Have tried their North Indian and indo-Chinese items but must say their South Indian dishes are their speciality."}
{"text":"I am teetering between 3 and 4 stars  My Experience:  I have been looking forward to trying Woodlands after reading all the wonderful reviews.  I live on the East side of town so I was excited to hear about a restaurant that is actually good over here!    The location is not ideal and let's just say it isn't in the most \"vibrant\" part of town.  When I first stepped into the restaurant I was not exactly impressed with the decor or the customer service.  I was there to pick up an order so I didn't get the full dining experience, but the overall vibe wasn't exactly cozy.  It looked like an old motel lobby that had been transformed into a restaurant but they decided to keep the same wall color, carpet, pleather chairs and cloudy chandeliers.    So, after I got past the dive aspect of this place I was excited to actually try my meal!   I ordered the mixed veggie curry in a cashew sauce and a friend ordered the Szechwan Noodles (w/ mushrooms).  And, of course, garlic naan.  Mine was good.  The sauce was lacking some flavor but it was decent.  The veggies were a little disappointing because it seemed like they took one of the frozen packets out of harris teeter and cooked them in their homemade sauce.  It was peas, carrots and green beans..pretty generic and definitely not fresh.  The Noodle Szechwan was good.  The coloring was a little off-putting (like a pinkish/red) because of the sauce but it was tasty.  The Naan was awesome...great flavor, crispy and warm--even for a take-out order.  Overall Summary:  This restaurant draws a diverse crowd and those looking for an authentic Vegetarian Indian meal cannot go wrong.  They have a ton of vegan options as well so there is a lot to choose from.  In the scheme of Indian Food in Charlotte I don't know that this was the \"best\" I have had but if in a crunch I would return."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic vegetarian Indian at indecently reasonable prices. Go. Like, now."}
{"text":"Being the vegetarian I am, woodland is a good option for me at anytime. The food over all was okay, we had the mango lassie for drinks, and cauliflower dipped appetizer with samosas. That a nice starter and flavorful. For the main dish we ordered the butter tofu, the portion was way too small even for one person. Generally Indian places give u big portions for their entrees, not at this place though! The dish was okay, but not very flavorful. For dessert we had the rose water ice cream, that is by far one of the worst thing I've tried anywhere! Knowing that I love rose water, this was an overload of sugar, highly don't recommend it. Would probably only try this place again for the appetizers, but aside from that not really my Indian place to be."}
{"text":"We had a good experience the first time we can here for dinner. The Chana batura was awesome and the dosas are huge! They had rushed us out a little since stayed past closing but I still would have given them 3.5 stars. I had to dock a star for the overpriced but good indian food and a half a star for the rush.   But we came here for the weekend buffet yesterday and they no longer offer the buffet option!!! I was so bummed. But we stayed for the regular menu. We started out with gobi Manchurian, good flavor but not enough spice or crunch like we expected. I ordered a Chana batura ($13) and my boyfriend got the North Indian thali with malai kofta (it was ok, Paradise Biriyani makes waaaay better kofta) and palak paneer ($17). Super pricy for indian food btw. After the appetizer, my boyfriend asked to make our entrees spicy. Instead of cooking to request, the waiter brought our food with a side plate of chilis. How was I supposed to incorporate this into my meal?!? Take a bite of chili?! The terrible service was more aggravating. There were two servers in the restaurant, the male was nice and checked up from time to time while the female back server was just terrible. We sat without a refill of water for more than 10 minutes and when I asked her for a refill, she only refilled my boyfriends glass and not mine. I had to call her back to get some water. She was either new or high, either scenario is viable since not refilling the entire table's glasses is just laughable.   The food was good but way overpriced, $17 for a smaller thali, no thanks! The service just sucked, kitchen and servers. I will stick to Cholas and Aroma in Concord."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Woodlands, even if you're not of the vegetation persuasion.* The menu is chock full of flavor and I defy you to leave anything other than stuffed to the gills with amazing food.  A favorite of mine is the paper dosa. Even if it sounds intimidating, you should order it. The sheer visual impact is enough to make it worthwhile.  Lots of chickpea dishes with splendid seasonings. I'd recommend ordering quite a few dishes and sharing with your dining party.   Naan, check. Samosas, check. Chana masala, check. Everything else I haven't tried? Probably going to be awesome, too.  Make the drive out to Woodlands. Eat, eat and be merry.    *Save the animals!"}
{"text":"Good food. Veg Uthappam & Tomato soup were good. Almost tasted like home cooked food. Booth seating could be better... The couches were not too comfy."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and we were in need of some take out. I remembered this as one of the restaurants I have bookmarked. Sure glad I did.   The samosa's (#7 on starters menu)  were incredibly flaky and cooked to a golden perfection. The inside was full of flavor and the chutney and other green sauce that accompanied it were like a flavor explosion in my mouth.   Speaking of explosions... wow that vindaloo was like a volcanic eruption in my mouth, damn that was spicy, I'm sweatin' just thinking about it... but I braved it out and finished it (took me three days, yep I'm a whimp to a degree!) It tasted incredible over my poached eggs for breakfast the next day.   But what I really loved was the Malai Kofta (#13 on the curries section), these were heavenly.... the potato dumplings were not heavy at all... carrots, peas, raisins stewed together in a lovely saffron based sauce with cashew and almond. This was incredible! You know... vegetarian food should not be caloric... damn it because I would have used a straw to suck down that sauce like a milkshake!   I got a cup of the tomato soup... well more like broth... interesting to say the least. I would save this for a rainy day when you're sick and can't keep anything down.  And of course, garlic naan to boot... really de-lish as well. It all came with basmati rice...  The man behind the counter said this would not feed the three of us... are you kidding me?!! I had leftovers for three days!   At first I was going to say it is quite pricey, but since I got three days of food out of this one visit, I'd say it is well worth it.   Can't wait to go back and try some more goodies!"}
{"text":"Woodlands has great vegetarian and vegan options as well as all organic options of Indian cuisine.  The food is fresh with outstanding flavor.  They have beer and wine to go with your dinner.  My only complaint was that the samosa wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still good.  It tasted like it wasn't as fresh as everything else I had. The rest of the food I had there was excellent, as was the service.  I recommend Woodlands for anyone who likes Indian food and is vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but I am a big fan! Not your typical Indian restaurant with its Chicken curry dishes and so on. A lot more interesting South India cuisine. The place is not fancy but the owner is really nice and the food really interesting! Went there 4 times in the last 2 months and the experience is consistent."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, two stars for the service. Only a few other customers but service was slow and our waiter seemed unenthusiastic about his job. Food had great flavor and it was so nice to have a 100% vegetarian menu to order from. We will definitely go back if we are in the area."}
