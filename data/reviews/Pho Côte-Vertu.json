{"text":"I really like this place! The staff is really nice and always checks up on you if you need anything. The food was good too! Its not salty like the orher places I've been to! I recommend!   PLUS! There's bubble tea so bonus"}
{"text":"Le restaurant offre une bonne variété de plats vietnamiens et leur pho est bon. J'aurai just aimer avoir un peu plus de viande avec la soupe. Cependant, le fait qu'il y a un chat Time (bubble tea) dans le restaurant compense pour le menu"}
{"text":"I usually never review restaurants... but this pho needed a review. I ordered a large pho and ended up having 3 thin slices of beef in my bowl with a few little pieces of tripes and tendons. Sorry I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Large selection of dishes (Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, Chinese), simple decor, spacious room, incredibly friendly staff (regularly came to talk to us and made many good jokes). Food was average in taste, portion size was slightly lower than competition and for price (low 10's). Has a bubble tea shop in the same building. The restaurant is a nice addition to Saint-Laurent."}
