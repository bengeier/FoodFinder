{"text":"Ordered a pizza and they didn't put all of the ingredients that was ordered on it. So I called to let them know and the girl was absolutely rude. I will drive TO Bellefontaine or Marysville before I order another pizza from them. Pretty sad when I live a couple of minutes away from the gas station."}
{"text":"Mediocre carryout, gas station and Pizza shop. It's dirty, over priced and employees are not that friendly.  But you're paying for the middle of nowhere convenience."}
{"text":"We order pizza here frequently. The pizza is cut into squares. We have got taco, deluxe and pepperoni. The pepperoni is our favorite. Huge pizza sizes. The wings are good too."}
