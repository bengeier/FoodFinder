{"text":"I'm a little sad that they changed their recipe/ingredients for their Egg Drop Soup & Hot & Sour soup. I read some reviews about their soup being \"bland.\" But I have to argue that it was NOT! I'm pretty sure they changed their soup because of the reviews... But they shouldnt have. Both the egg drop and hot & sour soup, now have peas and carrots in them, I hate smushy veggies! Not only that, the soup tastes more like vegetable soup rather than Egg or Hot & Sour. They were both perfect before the change.  We use to order them both in double quantity... Not anymore. So sad..."}
{"text":"Love, love this place!  Their mongolian beef and house special fried rice are the best.  Everything I've tried in this restaurant was amazing so far.  It's just a bummer that they don't open on Saturdays.  My husband and I only go to Vegas on weekends and normally leave on Sundays.  So sometimes, we miss having their food."}
{"text":"The food is good! Had the wonton soup and thought it was just going to be a couple of wontons but no it had plenty of veggies and slices of chicken and beef! Also had the salt and pepper fried fish, it was nicely seasoned and crunchy. Definitely a good place for a quick bite of Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! If you don't care much for fancy restaurants but want quality Chinese cuisine or just need to order something for pickup, this is an excellent place.   Make sure to try the house special chicken and salt and pepper fish filet.  Actually, everything is good. I keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"The best Asian food that I have had the graces to ever eat! Seriously if you're looking for a good place to eat, eat here.   Best food!  Best service!   My family of 5 ate here and I will definitely be bringing the rest of the family of 13 for future eat outs!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. They're super friendly. She always gives me (free) rice, and food is consistent and tastey. Food portions are excellent!"}
{"text":"Always looking for good neighborhood Chinese... #FoundIt. Had the salt n pepper wings, Mongolian beef and chicken special. Will be back for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great prices and huge portions. What more can you ask for?   Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Awesome customer service.  Eveybody is so pleasant!  Our favorite is the House Chicken and Sweet and Sour Soup, but we also tried everything else on the menu.  Good food. Great value."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, we drove out of our way to find this surprise! Ordered sweet and sour chicken and a bowl of egg drop soup the soup was enough for 4 people and the food was hot and delicious ! We will return to sample more of the menu.   Happy year for the monkey!"}
{"text":"Ordered garlic shrimp with extra mushrooms..no extra mushrooms to be found. The dish itself was tasty and portion size is good. I was expecting white rice but received fried rice, which was mediocre. I barely ate it because i didn't want the extra calories.  I would have preferred the white rice.  Next time i will specify.  Last, the hot and sour soup was decent, but i like more substance! Maybe some chunks of tofu and/or meat? It had no texture.  Baidu's on Rainbow has them beat on the soup & they also give you crackers. Overall i would try another dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service! I always take out and they're very fast and efficient all while having delicious and quality food. All of the workers are super friendly which makes Asian Fusion so amazing. The house chicken and salt & pepper shrimp are must try's!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing.. food is super good specially the house special chow mien.. food is not so salty as some chinese restaurant.. seasoned to taste.. the staff is very friendly very attentive of your needs..  the restroom is very clean too.. overall this place is a hidden gem.."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who the people are that have given this place 5 stars! What? Maybe I went on a bad day. If you like good food, do not go here. We ordered the lunch specials and an order of egg rolls. The owner/cook walked out just as I was asking if I can get all white meat for my chicken dish. The waiter asked him, he looked upset and said something in his Asian language. The waiter looked at me and said $2.00 extra. I said ok fine no problem. We got our lunch and no egg rolls, I said hey you forgot my egg rolls. The waiter was very nice and said sorry one minute. Five minutes later we got the egg rolls and then I was sorry. Half way through the filling was frozen! Don't waste your time. The food was ok and very bland not worth the money. I'm surprised this place is still open."}
{"text":"This is the best Americanized Chinese food restaurant in SW Vegas! Great local business, and I'll be coming here a lot more often!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was pretty good as far as take-out cheap Chinese food goes. Food was good...I had the Kung Pau Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork both were good and the portions were very large (especially for a lunch special). At $6.50 a piece with rice and soup. Great deal"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, delicious. I came to this place a month ago when I saw a banner stating that this place is under new management. I tried the place with my co-workers, and we were pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge, the prices not so much. The service is extremely pleasant. I have frequented this place many more times after my initial visit and the pricing, the service, and the portions have remained constant. Take this place for what it is: A neighborhood Americanized-Chinese restaurant that can and will suffice many a cravings. I hope that people give this place a try."}
{"text":"Huge portions! I even asked for egg drop soup, and the woman working there was very helpful when expressing it was for 2 people, so I said never mind. Then she came and gave me a small portion anyway, without me even asking! Such GREAT service if you dine in. Everything tasted perfect! My new spot for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Xlnt. What more do you need to know? Small place, clean. Table service and take out. Very friendly and good service. Portions are large so don't order too much."}
{"text":"Ordered the salt n pepper shrimp and house chicken special very satisfying! Lots of food! 2 ppl could share just the house special . Will b coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here and they give big portions here and everything was good. We ordered family style and share . We had mixed vegetables with chicken, Beijing pork, and salt and pepper chicken wings ( highly recommended).. Will be back too try other dishes!"}
{"text":"This is our family neighborhood go to for Chinese. We usually get it for take out but have dined in as well. The older woman who was running the place when we've gone is an absolute doll! She was attentive and goes the extra mile. Last time I got takeout, she saw I had little ones with me so she brought my order out to me when it was ready.  We always order the same things so I don't have experience with the entire menu except for we love the beef & broccoli  and mixed chow mein, we order those every time. Egg drop soup was good as well. Portions are great."}
{"text":"Nice people; nice food.  When I am in the mood for Fried rice, I order here.  If only it was delivery."}
{"text":"House Special Chicken is my new addiction! Also any of the Salt&Pepper Fried items (Chicken, Shrimp or Fish) are very good with extra jalape√±o!  The Soups could use some work and they should have more spice-based condiments available (Siracha)!!!  Stay tuned because they may be changing owners..."}
{"text":"I've tried several Chinese restaurants in town and they were all just \"okay.\" I discovered Asian Fusion Kitchen one day when a coworker and I were looking for a place to have lunch. We chose this restaurant over a sushi place a few doors down, and boy am I glad we did. The food is great and the service is excellent! The staff is so very nice and I love seeing their smiling faces every time I go in. I've added this one to my favorite places to eat and I highly recommend! This is the best place for Chinese food that I've found in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very plain and boring food. Chicken teriyaki was poor quality and one bite smelled like armpit body odor...gross! Hot and sour soup just ok. Beef chow fun was tasteless and the potstickers were chewy and tasted like they used doughnut dough...way too thick. At the time we were so hungry, but after dinner and thinking about it, it was pretty nasty food! This was our first and last time ordering from them."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday with a coworker. Venue was too warm. Felt like ac wasn't working. Ordered off the lunch menu. Fairly good portion for lunch price. Food tasted good. Only complaint is waitress had a very hard time with the English language which made ordering more difficult than it should of been. As I mentioned food was good but it didn't blow me away. Too many other places to help expand my waisteline."}
{"text":"Good local Chinese pick or delivery place. The food is delicious, the owner is very friendly(surprisingly nice by any Asian restaurant standard), the portions are huge, it can last you 2 days, and the prices are very cheap. What else do you need for a quick takeout? O highly recommend trying their Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian beef and War wonton soup."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere delicious food I had the house chow mein great portion size lots of meat. Flavored well. My gf had the lemon chicken. Very sweet, tender and crisp. Be careful of the chili oil. It will sneak up on you. It as well as the rest of the meal tho amazing."}
{"text":"Well this place in my opinion is a good 5 stars ! I came here with my sisters and the lady working there was super nice to us and she was very attentive to our needs ; we ordered a kung pao shrimp , a wor wonton and some fried chicken and let me tell you . The portions were so BIG for us three and they gave us enough soup for all three of us to drink . The salt peppered fried chicken though was so delicious I loved it so much it had a hint of spicy. The price was actually not bad at all considering how much food we got for it and even the chef came out and told us to be careful the chicken was still hot ! How sweet of them so considerate of us definitely coming back here . I think they're new owners from like 2 years back when liu's kitchen was there . I like these owners better though ."}
{"text":"So when I goto a restaurant I normally order 2 dishes and take them home as I love leftover Chinese food.  :) they just seem to taste better the next day.  Lol anyhoo...onto the review.  :)  They earned 1 extra star for bending over backwards to create a tofu dish which was NOT on the menu.  They had every other protein on the menu except tofu and I love tofu.  :) they created a tofu and vegetable dish in a white garlic sauce for me.  It was pretty good.  :) I asked for fried and got steamed tofu but it was tofu so all good.  :) beggars can't be choosers u know?  But next time I'm gonna ask for fried tofu and see what happens.  :)  The other dish that I got was a beef and broccoli dish.  Odd thing was that it had onions and carrots in it as well.  If I had known I would have asked for no carrots as I hate cooked carrots but the flavor was decent and the meat was pretty tender.    I would have given them 3 stars but they did make that tofu dish for me.  :) so 4 stars.  :)  I paid around $18 for 2 large entrees and 1 large fried rice.  Totally worth the money. There is no way I could even finish one entree. And the veggies were perfectly cooked.  They still had texture and definitely were not soggy which is what I love.  :)  I was thinking that these were the same owners as Liu's BUT it's not.    I have been hesitant to try them but after today I will definitely be back to try something else.  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Cream cheese wontons were perfect. More than just cream cheese and so crispy. Pot stickers were also scrumptious. Perfectly crispy on one side and doughy on the other. Yummy meat filling. Garlic chicken was great. Good balance of meat and veggies. I added broccoli which they so graciously allowed. Kung pao shrimp fantastic. Perfect spice level.  All around excellent meal. So glad we found this place!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Really great food and amazing service! They were so friendly from the second we walked in. Suggestions were provided and they even checked to see how we liked our food, you can tell they definitely want you to be satisfied with your meal!   The portions were huge for the price you pay. We ordered the garlic chicken and house special chicken, both delicious, and we shared family style. Will definitely stop by here again for their lunch special.   Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is a cheap and fast Chinese place  to dine in or do a take out. Also the portions are always big but still have flavor.   I have been here twice now and every time I have come in the lady at the cashier has always been hospitable and greeted me  with a smile ."}
{"text":"It been awhile since looked for Chinese lunch food special. I notice Asian Fusion Kitchen. I got thinking this was the spot get my lunch special on again. I reminder this place being two different Chinese restaurant under different ownership. Just thought was interesting. Lol!   The menu is not that big when I think about most Chinese restaurants. Really for the most part has your normal or should say most common items see at every Chinese restaurants. On the back of the menu have the lunch specials. They have ten different ones choose from. I went with the Chicken Broccoli. The lunch specials come with your choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup. I went with the hot and sour soup. I thought was pretty tasty. The chicken and broccoli. I was definitely impressed with it! It decent size portion for lunch special. It nice and hearty. They give you bunch of vegetables besides broccoli, nice amount of chicken, and the KEY for me is the sauce. I had no expectations. It usually been hit or miss with me with Chinese lunch specials. The sauces can sometimes lack any kind of distinct flavor or any flavor period. Asian Fusion Kitchen they do it right. Light not heavy sauce. Just refreshing dish, perfect light hearty lunch, and the price is steal of deal (even with soda) under $10. Woot! Woot! I definitely plan on coming back try more of the lunch special list.  The service was awesome. She was very attentive, friendly, and great service."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant here in Vegas.. I order at least 3 times a month. ;) staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best asian cusine plavces I have been to here in Las Vegas.  From the hot and sour soup to the main entrees, such as the orange chicken and creme cheese wontons, this place was amazing.  The food was amazing, fresh and presentation was on point!  I highly recommend Asian Fusion to anyone who wants some authentic asian cuisine"}
{"text":"Honestly very bland Chinese. The ladies were very nice however. My first issue was not understanding if they deliver or not. Yelp says they do but the app you use to order online didn't give the option for delivery.   Based on the fact that they called with the food ready in less than 10 minutes tells me everything is pre-made and just heated up. We got crab wontons, Kung pao chicken, cashew chicken and the lemon chicken. Everything was very bland with little flavor and the Kung pao chicken was not very spicy at all. The rice and chicken for all dishes was dry as well.   I will be going elsewhere unfortunately"}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was good. The fried rice a bit bland and the Orange Chicken was all dark meat cut in very small, thin pieces. If I get it again I'll avoid the Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"all those 5 star reviews must be from their friends, lol. It was not a bad place with previous owners, not now."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now (House Special Chicken and Garlic Chicken) and both dishes are amazing.  I think I've found my new favorite lunch spot!   Just a hint: They've started allowing online orders through Yelp, which is cool, but make sure you designate the time you'll wanna pick it up (leaving as \"ASAP\" caused a little confusion).  I should of simply looked at the clock, added 10 mins, and hit COMPLETE.   Regardless... Awesome joint!"}
{"text":"Great food good portions and friendly service. Wanton soup was excellent.  Great place for a quick meal"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I savor every bite of everything we ordered. In short: AMAZING!!! The flavor, the portion, the value is incredible. My boyfriend and I ordered take-out and the food was still steaming when we opened the boxes. Easily the best cream cheese crab ragoons I've ever had! Each one had plenty of filling and fried to perfection, not soggy at all. The orange chicken is tangy and delightful, we went with mild heat, next time I might try medium. Fried rice is on point. But let me try to describe the wonder that is the Kung Pao Chicken... Again, I went with the mild heat which is perfect for my liking, but the sauce and seasoning are almost indescribable I love all the veggies that were included: green onion, zucchini, green pepper, white onion, red peppers, and peanuts. My mouth is so happy I could cry  this was our first visit, but I know we will be loyal customers from now on! I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for DELICIOUS and reasonably priced Chinese food, look no further! The only suggestion I have is to call your order in advance, there is a wait but it is worth it. My boyfriend and I had the chicken wontons, vegetable chow mein, orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken and it was so good!!! Next time we are in town, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I love small independent Chinese restaurants.  I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area so I've experienced a LOT of Asian food.  This place is really really good.  I had the garlic chicken - cooked perfectly - crispy chicken and crunchy zucchini with a savory garlic sauce.  My only criticism is that the hot and sour soup was a little thinner than I'm used to - but overall a really good meal, a really fair price, and wonderfully friendly staff - try it - you'll like it"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! My brother lives near here and everything,e we get together for a pool day, we always order from here.  The servings are huge, the dishes are full of flavor, and the staff are extremely helpful and sweet!   I have recommended this place to a lot of family and friends and they are always happy they ate here."}
{"text":"Actually had really good food, would of been a 5 star if it wasn't for my vegetable fried rice tasting fishy. If you like fish you will prob love the fried rice. (Which is my favorite part) Everything else was good"}
{"text":"I tried to have a nice takeout lunch in front of the tv for my Saturday afternoon and what I got was me eating cardboard for about 3 minutes before I threw the dish in the trash. Bland, flavorless, driver did not have change for a $20 bill to pay and tip (this was a cash transaction). My expectations were low to begin with now I literally just feel sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"This is my first time here but I love the atmosphere. It's comfortable but yet quiet. The waitress is vey nice and she always checked up on us to see if we were doing okay. The interior is quite nice and clean. The food itself is very good and the portions are big which is a plus! I definitely recommend this place (:"}
{"text":"The egg drop soup as changed a few times in the last few weeks. I like the most recent recipe. The first couple of times it was too bland.  I've tried the kung pao shrimp, cashew chicken, orange chicken, and house special chicken. All items were tasty.  Competitors nearby: It's better than Rice & Noode. I don't think there are any other chinese type places nearby.  Flavor: 4 out of 5 Location (compared to competitors nearby): 5 out of 5 Price: 5 out of 5, you sure get your moneys worth  I'm giving this place 5 stars for lack of competitors nearby. You'd probably have to drive 15-20 minutes away to find anything better."}
{"text":"Place is great. Food is delicious! Owners are nice and honest ppl. Restaurant is cheap! Food is authentic. I'm Chinese myself, from the motherland and I enjoy coming here versus other Chinese places because it's good, clean, Chinese food (other places can be less caring when it comes to their food,unfortunately).   But yeah. I love this place. I'm a premed student and US NAVY  veteran and i need to save money while staying healthy so I try to come here more often!"}
{"text":"I saw all the great yelp reviews and had to try it myself. We were not disappointed! Everything we ordered was bomb dot com. We got a lot of food so that we had leftovers to take with us. We got the Rangoon, ppt stickers, egg rolls, crispy beef, house special chicken and combo chow mein. Everything was so delicious. I honestly think its the beat Chinese food I've had in a long time. The lady who took our order gave us the beat service as well. She checked on us, brought us a pitcher of water, and she was always polite and smiling. She seemed like she really enjoyed her work and was happy we were enjoying the food. This will definately be our new fav spot for Chinese food. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times before, the food and service is always outstanding. The dish portions are fairly large, it can be shared with a couple more people. The price is reasonable since the dishes are big. The House Special Chicken is one of my favorites on their menu! Now I have a new Chinese restaurant to recommend to friends and family nearby!"}
{"text":"This is a great, family owned and run restaurant. The food is fantastic and the owners make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I'm obsessed. The \"chicken special\" reminds me of pick up stix!! Staff is friendly and quick. This will end up being a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and proximity to my house.  This place was yummy and service was fast and food cook to order.  We had Egg Drop Soup (shared between two), Orange Chicken and the Salt and Pepper Wings.  Stuffed our faces and still have leftovers.  Reasonably priced too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here plenty of times.  The food is always excellent.  All of the employees are very polite and friendly every time I come in here."}
{"text":"Not bad, really, but not good. What seemed apparent is that they go cheap on the items. For example, the Crab Rangoon was all fried dumpling with very little filling. The egg rolls were actually spring rolls. The sesame chicken was basically tiny bits of chicken, so it tasted more like popcorn chicken. I'm not sure how this place has so many good reviews. Perhaps because it's convenient? The staff is really nice and the place is clean but the food was not very good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite, local take-out place. I can't review anything on the menu besides the sesame chicken, because that's what I'm craving any time we order chinese take-out! (Yeah, I know, worst Yelp review ever...)  With that said, the prices are very affordable, our food is always ready on time (and quickly!), and they give you a lot of food! My husband and I usually can split one dinner order between the two of us. At least for the sesame chicken dish they give you a ton of chicken! The service is usually pretty friendly, too.   I was also actually surprised by how nice the inside of the restaurant is; it looks like they've recently remodeled."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of this place, I'd go every night if I could. I love love love their fried rice, but I wish there was pork fried rice also lol. Still super tasty, and really fast (literally ten minutes from start to finish)!!! And their service is so kind and so polite. I'd definitely recommend this place, they've only been open here for a month, and it's already my new favorite place."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch and I had a really good experience as far as customer service.  They really value customers opinions on the food and were gracious about my feedback.  Very rare these days.  Small businesses like this always deserve the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong or don't make you enjoy your food.  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and my shrimp had tasted very sour.  The server asked me if I liked my food and I told them my honest opinion.  My food otherwise was excellent.  She immediately and profusely insisted I order something else.  So I ordered a Kung Pao Chicken to go.  The wife loved it and I definitely will be back.  She didn't even charge me for the shrimp fried rice.  Before I left she explained she tasted it too and agreed with me and it came preseasoned from there vendor.  Her and the cook apologized at least several times and thanked me for bringing the matter to there attention.  For sure this place is bookmarked and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing and the workers here are so kind and generous! The food is delicious, cheap, and hits close to home. The dishes are plentiful and enough to be shared by more than two people. Their egg drop soup is BOMB!"}
{"text":"Super bland. No veggies in the fried rice, and the crab rangoon tastes weird and had a yellow color to it on the inside."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I ordered take-out through the Yelp app at 9:00pm during a weekday when they closed at 9:30pm. I showed up at 9:15pm, my food was packaged and I paid in advance through the app. Easy to place an order, and they get your food ready quickly. Portions are also VERY large, good enough for two meals at least."}
{"text":"I used to always order take out from here. But under management now, food is horrible, the size of food u get is definitely not family size. Everything was served on or in disposable dishes. So sad .. just horrible."}
{"text":"My first time eating here I was excited to eat because I've been craving Chinese food for the longest time. I order the house special chicken and house chow mein. I wasn't all that in love with the meat. It was really soft and squishy. The chicken and the beef in my chow mein were both like that. squishy meat isn't that good of an experience. Other than that the lady Vicky was very nice and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Since this place is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away from my house, I've had the great pleasure of stopping by and being served by these lovely people.  I almost always stop by and get their House Special Chicken. It's delicious, it's simple, it's absolutely amazing. Great presentation, and the flavors are rich and on point. I've also tried their crab rangoons, wonton soup, and fried rice is simple, yet not oily at all and delicious.  That's the best way to describe Asian Fusion Kitchen, it's simple and delicious. They don't go over the top, they don't complicate things, they know what works for them, and they do it well. The prices aren't expensive, an the portions are HUGE for what you pay.  Service, now that's something you don't get much of at traditional Asian restaurants. AFK steps it up here, everyone has always been super polite and very accommodating to our requests.  All in all, we will definitely make this place a regular stop when the fridge is low on funds, and the appetite is high!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here.  Best asain food in town. I go here at least 2 to 3 times a week. I suggest the beef with hot garlic sauce."}
{"text":"The most amazing food I've had in a long time! Easily the best.   We are here on holiday and my honey wanted some spicy food. I suggested Chinese and got on yelp. The reviews are great but I don't think it does this place justice.   No frills, clean and quiet. We came around 4:30pm before the dinner rush so there was no one here. We ordered the house chicken, salt and pepper pork chops, beef chow mein and the cream cheese wontons.   The waitress, who is likely one of the owners was very proficient, very sweet and checked in with us the entire time. Making sure we were comfortable, had enough of everything. She brought pitchers of water and extra napkins without prompting. But the food was out of this world.   Everything was brought out plate by plate, steaming hot and as fresh as it gets. The house chicken was mind blowing. The perfect amount of sweet with savory. The green onions were cooked in the sauce and really made the flavor pop. The cream cheese wontons were perfectly crispy and the filling was sweet and balanced. The scallions were a great touch to the cream cheese filling. The beef chow mein was incredible. The noodles were perfect. The chunks of beef were huge! The onions perfectly tender yet crisp. The salt and pepper pork chops however were like nothing we had ever had before. Big pieces of pork, coated in a tempura batter and fried perfectly. The topped with tons of salt and pepper along with saut√©ed jalape√±os. They had a flavor that was like nothing we had tasted before.   Between the service and the food, it's easy to say that we will come back whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer here since my job is right around the corner. Great food, great portions, very friendly staff. Their egg drop soup is delicious. My favorite dishes are the beef & broccoli & the Mongolian beef. The sauce is very flavorful & their food is always fresh.  If you're looking for fast, tasty & cheap this is the place!"}
{"text":"At the entrance there's a sticker that says \"People love us on Yelp,\" but I'm the first person to review this place. Take that sticker down.  With no reviews, I took a chance. Expecting an Asian fusion menu, the menu is similar to one you'd find at China A Go Go. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special, which came with rice (white or fried) and soup (egg drop or hot and sour). Service was good. Egg drop soup was solid, orange chicken was pretty bad, and the fried rice was mediocre. With so many other options in the area for quick Americanized Chinese food, this place doesn't make the cut."}
{"text":"I got the cashew chicken, Mongolian beef, Eggdrop soup, and crab rangoon. These are my favorite on the menu. I brought this home to the family for the first time and they really liked it! I don't normally eat chinese food but I go to this place because its quick, cheap, and convenient. try it out! you won't be disappointed :D"}
{"text":"My wife & I have had lunch here twice now and we enjoyed everything we have tried.  The staff is very friendly and the portion sizes are much larger than most.  The price for their lunch special is very reasonable and they are quick in service."}
{"text":"Nice place, I've been coming here for awhile. This used be to Liu's kitchen but it's under new management. The egg drop is good. Salt and pepper pork chops is really good. This place has better food then some of the other Chinese hole in the walls around this area."}
{"text":"It was a nice size portion for lunch plate but food was bland. Had hot and sour soup and house special chicken with egg rolls. Everything lacked flavor.... Not returning."}
{"text":"After the reviews I read, I really wanted to love this place. Maybe my score is based more on not meeting the high expectations I had after reading all the great reviews. Dined a few days ago. Portions are huge. Prices are great. But I was disappointed. No vegetables in the fried rice. Egg rolls seemed like they were actually spring rolls. Hours of business don't really work with my schedule. Wish there would've been more sauce on my entree. But with the price and the portion size, it begs you to give it another shot."}
{"text":"My favorite to go place. Ordered Mongolian beef with mushroom and chicken lettuce wrap. Food was really good. And they deliver too."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service. Placed my order online at 7:29pm and I called to cancel my order at 8:45pm. I waited 1 hr and 15 minutes and my order never arrived. And when I called to cancel, the lady didn't seem to care to make things right. Absolutely horrible. I will tell everyone I know not to order delivery from this place."}
{"text":"Your basic Chinese food with not very many options on the menu. Service was fine and the price was right."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Quick service. Tables were a bit sticky but it was just due to the tables themselves. Cleaning chemicals wearing them down and such. A bit worn down. Otherwise very tidy and clean."}
{"text":"We love this place, Asian Fusion Kitchen is a must for our family everytime we're in Vegas! We love the hot & sour soup and the Mongolian beef. We make sure to order a large soup so we have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Great food and portions are good.  She warned us we were ordering to much and was on top of everything.  Food was hot and fresh and at the end of the meal she even boxed our left overs ...we will come back and FYI lemon chicken is bomb :)"}
{"text":"Don't order from here. Changed management not worth ordering. Food quantities are ridiculously small compared to before. Basically got a bic macs worth of food for $35. thumbs down"}
