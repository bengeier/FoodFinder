{"text":"Burgers were mediocre.  Did not taste fresh nor did the fries.  Food is way over priced!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only was the food delicious but the services is impeccable! We didn't have just 1 person ask us if we were enjoying our meal but 3! A young kid even asked if we needed him to clear our table and asked if we needed anything else. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this place from a nearby coffee shop, very very disappointed.  To the restaurant, since the patties are very thin please train your cooks to not burn the edges so much, the taste of burned meat stayed in my mouth for most of the night and at 6.00 for a burger I should have went across the street to in n out to eat.   Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"absolutely refreshing place to eat at.. the staff had fun and worked as a team. food was great also!!"}
{"text":"Just ate there again today and as always, the employees are still super friendly (FOUR different employees stopped by our booth to check on us!) and the food was also still great.  I have stopped by here many times since my last review and this location still delivers great service and great food."}
{"text":"not good, that is about as plainly as I can put it!  Way too greasy and fries are always cold.  Bread gets wet from grease!  Yuck!  I would bypass this place and go anywhere else, perhaps, mcdonald's or any other chain, but NOT this one!  I even tried to contact the management staff, nothing was fixed or changed.  Never again!  You lost me and my family and co-workers."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but drive thru customer service is horrible when I asked for condiments the girl just rolled her eyes as she went to get them"}
{"text":"I have mixed thoughts. I went there just now. I took a long time to read the menu because I was looking up ingredients. When I pulled up to the window I could see the manager or someone inside yelling at employees. I saw a lot. Because they take forever to get food out. This is my third time at this location. Once the line was forever and when I got home my order was completely wrong. Another time I waited over 20 minutes in the line. A person behind me got out of line to leave and eventually I did to as I had to be at an appointment. I won't go back to this location. The food is good, but the people inside need to treat each other with respect and get moving as a team.  On the other hand my usual location is Surprise. Great fast service and great food."}
{"text":"3 stars because I do always enjoy the food however I did deduct 1 star because the restaurant was filthy and has been every time I've been here (wife works in the area).   My main issue with this restaurant is the customer service from one individual that works here. The first time I was here I brushed it off on maybe she was having a bad day, the 2nd time I did the same, but now I'm on 7th or 8th visit and it's plain to see she either hates people, or her job. (Long brown hair, square black framed glasses, can't remember her name). Even the times I came through the drive through she looked extremely unpleasant.    If people come to your restaurant and think to themselves \"man I hope I don't get that girl\", there's an issues.   She doesn't invite people to the register, she just stands there and stares at you till you address her, she doesn't smile, she very blatantly shows negative emotions when asked to assist with front counter duties. Being the first impression when you walk through the door you want your employees to make customers feel welcomed and comfortable. She makes you feel like you're annoying her.   I've heard groups of people talking about her attitude at their booths as well.   Im im the service industey as well and would Invest some time into training this person on proper customer service.   Like I said tho, food is great, place needs to be cleaned more often.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat fast food because it's all the same, greasy and bland. this place isn't any different, the patties are super thin and and flavorless. as for the service... haha. this place is overpriced and bland."}
{"text":"Like that the food is made fresh, the fries are awesome with the fry sauce.  We have never had the custard because we are always too full to eat it.  A little pricey but always a great experience."}
{"text":"I never usually leaves reviews but I'm just so impressed with this location! Every time I've come in the service is always amazing and the food is delicious. This is my favorite location by far! The staff is always so quick and courteous and I've never once had a bad experience here! Definitely will be coming back:)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience... They messed up my order through the drive thru and they were not to happy when I told them. I was nice about it. I waited for my order and it was brought out to me, but you could tell by the look on his face that it was an inconvenience to them. Well, I got food poisoning. I can't hold anything down. This really sucks because their food is really good. Thanks to the staff working today, I will definitely never be going back again."}
{"text":"Hire competent employees, I guess that's not what you want. Worst customer service, always 15 minutes minimum in drive thru, and order is always incorrect. Would never recommend this place again to anybody"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Lots of ways to have them, single double or triple, California style with lettuce and tomato, patty melt, tons of different condiments to choose from.  One of us had the patty melt double with half portion of the grilled onions - they got it right.  One had a burger with lettuce, tomato and onion (California style).  I had the A-1 Chop House burger (mushrooms, white cheese, grilled onions and steak sauce.  There was a bit too much sauce which made the burger slide around and fall apart a bit too much.  Other than that, all of the burgers were excellent, good taste, cooked consistently medium well (all parties).  Excellent fries and onion rings, and the chili cheese fries were perfect with lots of chili and just enough cheese.  Of course we had to sample the frozen custard.  The medium is really big, I opted for the small.  One of us had his plain, the other with all of the sundae fixings (chocolate sauce, whipped cream and the inevitable maraschino cherry.  All in all a nice place to go, plenty of options and great frozen custard for dessert!"}
{"text":"Yeah....I'm not so sure about this place. With so many choices for a burger these days what differentiates Freddy's from everyone else?  The burgers were painfully thin and the texture was that of gristle. The fries are the super thin shoestring type, not my fave. The service was slow in the drive thru and lacked any sort of personalization. So in the end I'm struggling to see what makes these guys any better than the others?"}
{"text":"Today at 6:24p Thanks for the chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries but how am I supposed to eat this with no fork or spork and two napkins. My hands? Clowns."}
{"text":"Very courteous, good food, and accommodating. I can't give 5 stars bc being gluten intolerant they only have ice cream for someone like me. I cannot even have fries bc the fries are cooked with chicken that is wheat covered.   Doing wheat free in food = 5 stars"}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is a better, but more expensive, dairy queen.  The double steak burger was ok, the fries were good.  I think the combos should be $1-$2 less.  I can appreciate the food being cooked once it is ordered.  The dining area was relatively clean.  I will try another of their locations next time and get a dessert.  Freddys is worth trying and seeing what you think."}
{"text":"Burgers and food are great, staff is friendly.  Bathrooms are HORRIFYING, smelly and gross.  They show signs of neglect for many years.  Not a good way to represent this brand, the employees, or customers.  We can't return to this location."}
{"text":"This place is all hype. Expensive, small patties, terrible service. Plus I ask for extra sauce (see picture) wtf? Go to in n out."}
{"text":"I am running out of crazy ways to introduce my reviews now.  LOL I will say that Freddy's is one of my favourite burger places.  I mean there are a lot of them now, but Freddy's seems to separate themselves some how.  The food is really good.  I like their fries too.  I was here with my niece this time and she loves it because she is young.  I am getting a tad older and have to watch the food.  The burgers are just really good here.  We did not do custard this time because we were on a mission to get candy from the candy store in the mall.  Which was a successful mission too. I loved reading the history of the man that started this place too."}
{"text":"Stopped by Freddie's on Bell Rd after reading the reviews. It is much like Steak and Shake which means a great burger and fries. My wife had the paddie melt which also was very good. Would give it a five star but they offer Pepsi and not Coke!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but it took forever to get our two meals. The restaurant was very dirty inside... It was not busy at all, but most of the tables were not cleaned, trash and food on the floor, and the doors/windows were very dirty. This was my first time at this location as we usually go to the Freddy's in Surprise. The Surprise location is much quicker, cleaner, and just seems to have a better atmosphere. Maybe we just came in here on an off day.?.?.?"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Steak and Shake since I could remember. I absolutely loved their burgers, UNTIL my hubs took me to Freddys and my tastebuds literally exploded! Everything was delicious! The bread and sauce, the meat, the cheese! And because it was my first time there, the staff gave me a giant bowl of custard with caramel and I lost it! I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers an shakes nice an polite service.  I like the double an fires with cheese.  For how busy it is the place is really clean not hard to find good seating."}
{"text":"I love the French fries, which is generally something I can do without! Killer fry sauce too!  The burgers are awesome - the meat is really tasty!  The custard goodies are good, but certainly not what I would come here for!  The food is great!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Freddy's, first was in CO so I was looking forward to trying their food again. We went to the drive-thru & the girl taking our order was patient & didn't make us feel rushed. She repeated our order back to us which I always appreciate, especially in a drive-thru. We waited a min or so & our food was ready. Our car smelt sooo good. My husband & I both ordered double cheeseburgers & split an order of fries. Their fries are AWESOME! Super thin, crispy & the perfect amount of seasoning. The burger was way too much for me. I'm not a huge fan of large meat patties & thought the singles would be skimpy which is why I ordered a double, next time I will def order a single. I could barely finish. The burger was very flavorful & tasted fresh. Their menu of ice cream treats was huge & I look forward to trying something off of the dessert menu in the future. Can't wait to come back for more fries :)"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing! Try the chile cheese fries as a meal or on the side. They have the  best custard ever,  I like vanilla the best. I don't think I've ever eaten anything there I didn't like"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food burger and fries. The burger is cooked through and if you order is California Style you'll get lettuce, tomato and Freddy sauce. The Freddy Sauce is very good. I guess it is similar to 1000 Island, but better. They also have Jalapeno Freddy Sauce which is just the right heat. I have yet to try the ice cream, cuz I eat too much burger and fries. The fries are seasoned and very flavorful. I really like shoestring fries! Oh, and the Fried Cheese Curds are really good as long as they are still warm. I've been here twice in 5 days. I really like the food here!"}
{"text":"I popped into Freddy's just because I liked the name. I have to say this, it was much better than a \"Salt Burger\". Oops, I meant to say Smash Burger. The difference is that this burger didn't have nearly as much sodium infused into the burger as the aforementioned competitor. The last time I had a Smash-Burger, it was like taking 5 of those little silver packets from the Top Ramen and pouring them directly down your throat.  Freddy's is clean, the beef is good, and the service was good too. It is adjacent Arrowhead Mall, so their are so many things to do and see in this area. During the winter months, it is a stop on the way to Cardinals games or the Yotes. In summer they are really close to all of the spring training baseball.  I have not tried the custard here but would like to do so. Although that may add to my already starting to plump like a butterball frame. This place reminds you a little bit of a 5 guys without paying $12.50 for a burger and a coke. The world has changed for sure and I'm not sure when it shifted? Paying $5.99 for a burger used to be the staple. Today it's crazy for a fast food style burger it's $8.99 and up.  Freddy's, I will be back soon to take on the challenge of a Funnel Cake or Custard soon. WESTSIDE!!!!! Peace out. #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Love this place, they are always super friendly and the food comes out quick even when they are busy. The hot dogs and fries are amazing. I always make sure I get a chocolate peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"Burgers were tasty, not a lot of meat, but good. Make sure you tell them you do not want a combo or they automatically give you one. The custard was really good too."}
{"text":"I love love love their cheeseburger and custard!!! Wished they have normal French fries instead of the skinny ones."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and amazing dessert to finish it off! Never a bad experience here snd we love coming back!"}
{"text":"I originally reviewed this place saying how terrible the food was. Looks like they deleted my review somehow. I'm here again to post another horrible experience. I ordered a chocolate malted shake with extra malt. I couldn't taste the malt in it. I drove back and my husband went inside to get it remade...got it again and it couldn't taste it again. How fucking hard is it to add extra?!? So, I called management and had to drive back AGAIN to get a refund. I'm am beyond fucking irritated. If I wanted a chocolate shake I could order it from anywhere!!!! This was literally there one chance to redeem themselves after the first terrible experience I had. They didn't. Stay away from this place. Its fucking awful."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. I came here with a few coworkers during our lunch break. Customer service was lacking. We were not greeted when we walked in or acknowledged when we were standing looking at the menus.  The biggest issue I had was the cleanliness.  The tea urns that the store looked like they have NEVER once been washed they are brown and dirty with no lids to prevent contamination. The soda station itself was covered in what looked like dirt with a water marks everywhere.  I work in the food service industry and tea urns and the soda station should never look like that. The only way that they get that way is when they're not washed.   Multiple of the meals we purchased were supposed to receive sauce and we got none and when I went to ask for some I  was handed one.  When I asked for more the cashier just looked at me and then I had to explain what we ordered. For two chicken finger meal's onion rings and cheese curds we received three sauces. They acted as tho it was an unconvinced to get me sauce! There were 6 of us eating we needed sauce."}
{"text":"The burgers leave something to be desired. The fries with the Freddy sauce is amazing and normally the reason for our trip. I just wish the burgers were thicker but that's just me."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this place from the outside so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did. From excellent customer service that is fast and friendly to a clean welcoming environment that brings nostalgia to mind. It's exactly the kind of place my parents would have taken us to in the old days. Black checked floors and red booths and chairs. Order at the counter and they call your number when ready everything is cooked to order. I had the patty melt combo and it was perfectly cooked with crunchy bread. The shoestring fries are good and since the burger was so tasty I decided to try their custard. Excellent in terms of everything and  I know I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there after movie worst burgers ever ! Frys greasy and cold bathroom dirty ! I would never go back music so loud at at register I could hardly hear the girl and she could not hear me"}
{"text":"Worst burger I've ever eaten. I've had better burgers at McDonald's. So that's saying something. It was the  thinnest slice of meat I've ever seen and burnt to a crisp. I went here after work at 10:30pm tonight. I guess the cook and employees wanted to enjoy their night. The expensive burger went right in the trash. What garbage! Don't go to here if you want a good meal. I will be calling corporate if the morning. I'd give negative 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Tried Freddys for the first time. I'm a big fan of good burgers and shakes. I ordered the Original Double Cheeseburger, and the patties were VERY thin, and the edges were burned, thin, tasteless portions of beef. Nothing like the photos and definitely below In N Out or even McDs Big Mac. The shake was good and the fries were OK. Probably will not be back and I can't recommend them."}
{"text":"Wow...this is so much better than DQ or McDonalds or all the other places you can get fake ice cream!  Loved it. Vanilla seemed more runny and soft, and the chocolate should be called chocolate fudge as it is more like fudge than milk chocolate but both good.   I love this place, my thighs love this place, my mouth loves this place."}
{"text":"I had been here a few years back while I was in town and didn't remember being here until I saw my review at another location and it was funny because I ordered the same burger and the same Turtle as last time. atleast Im consistent I guess. too bad we don't have one close to home in Cali."}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix 5 days ago and kept seeing Freddy's so I decided to give it a try today. I'm from Atlanta, so the only steak burger place we have there is Steak n Shake. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a cashier and he went through the menu with me on after I let him know it was my first visit. So I got the #1 (Freddy's Original Double) just how it comes. The burger was excellent and the fries were piping hot so I added the fry seasoning. The Fry's in the fry sauce was superb as well. Overall great food and great service so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I usually love Freddys! Amazing burgers and shoestring fries and hands down best mint oreo shake I have ever had, usually.. I was very disappointed in this location as I recently took my boyfriend in to try it since he loves mint oreo and we ordered two large shakes. It took about 15 minutes in the drive through line with only two customers, us and the one car in front of us. By the time we got to the window the man took our payment and then proceeded to go make two tiny shakes. He realizes the mistake and has to make them again. After waiting for 25 minutes for a 6 dollar shake we tried drinking the shakes and it barely had any cookie crumbs at all in it. I am unsure who was working that day but he needs more training."}
{"text":"Freddy's cheeseburgers are so delicious and their Freddy's jalapeño fry sauce is one of the best sauce I've ever tasted and it's addicting I put it on everything. Great food and awesome customer service"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix on our way back to Cali and stopped here for lunch. Place was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Burgers are a touch greasy, but still tasty. We gave them 5 stars anyway because of the customer service. Great job!"}
{"text":"Love Freddy's!  The best french fries & dipping sauce on the planet.  The burgers are really good too.  The service is always great.  Do yourself a favor & check this place out."}
{"text":"Nice retro style fast food diner! Yet to have a mistake and always seems to be a clean friendly establishment when I pull up. Foods delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced! Excellent location, they're quick.. I mean, what more can I say!? If ya haven't tried Freddy's Steakburgers and Frozen Custards go now! Oh, and they have veggie burgers just incase ;)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was one of the dirtiest restaurants I've seen in awhile. I was almost afraid to eat here, but my son was begging for fries and a custard. I should have definitely gone somewhere else with all the options nearby, but I'd had luck with the Freddy's in Gilbert, so I thought things would be the same. Big Mistake! I should have held out for Culver's! Every surface in this restaurant was dirty, the countertops, tables, floors, and don't even think about going into those filthy bathrooms! And this was at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, definitely not what I would consider a lunch rush either since the place was nearly empty (only 7 of the 30 tables were occupied). I guess other people have noticed the lack of cleanliness here and decided to eat elsewhere, not really sure.....either way I wouldn't recommend eating here ever again."}
{"text":"Freddy's.  I think you have the best burger/fry combinatio in town.  Excellent job.  3 stars because of two things.  Brain dead employee talking to her Boy friend in the restaurant.  We crossed paths when i went to get my order as I crossed her path shes all giggly w her bf and almos ran me over.  2.  Not a christmas. Scrooge but your christmas music is too loud , too old, and I felt like U was at my grandparents house or in church when you play church hymms..  Just not enjoyable at all.  I will come back in January."}
{"text":"Really enjoy eating their double steak burger California style with chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Delicious all around! Great burgers, great shoestring fries, great fry sauce, and great desserts! Very friendly service too. It almost felt like you were at a Chick-fil-A because they were so darn friendly! I definitely liked the shoestring fries with my friend did not. I don't really care that they were really skinny because the fry sauce overall made up for it.  Just great Classic Diner kind of atmosphere and definitely some place I want to try again!"}
{"text":"In the words of the great Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) in Lethal Weapon 2, \"They always f$@& you at the drive thru!\"   First I get drinks without the lids on tight so I've got a front seat soaked in root beer.  Second, they short me an order of fries.  Third, my daughters burger was overlooked to the point it was crispy.   With In-n-Out and Five Guys both within 2 blocks I won't be giving Freddy a second chance."}
{"text":"Generic middle class burger joint like five guys or in n out burger.  Burger patty quality and taste are good.   Being my first time eating here I ordered a single patty burger instead of the double.....wrong choice.  Go with the double patty as the burgers patties are extremely thin.   As for the custard...FREAKING AMAZING! Ask for a sample, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loveeee coming here. I have never had a bad experience with the food or with customer service. I love the smiling faces with positive attitudes I get when i first walk in. I do not have a negative comment on my food. Fries are always crispy and burgers are delish! Love the steak burger and the Freddy sauce, yum!"}
{"text":"Even if the food wasn't amazing (it is!) we'd go back for the amazing service! Every time we come here the staff is so friendly and go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect!   And the fry sauce... Can we all just have a moment and reflect on the fry sauce... OMG!!!   This is definitely, hands down our go-to fast food burger joint!"}
{"text":"Do I give a 3 or a 4? I go to their stories because they are clean and I can get protein without the bun. They are good for a burger as that is all I get at their location. My wife and grandchildren like to go there because of the selection of food for the grandchildren. Always find something each one wants and will eat. The servers are always friendly and eager to help. They always come by the table to see if you want it cleaned of your finished items and to ask is everything is OK."}
