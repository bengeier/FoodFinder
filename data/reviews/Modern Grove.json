{"text":"What an awful experience, overpriced food no service at the table and had to beg to get a refill. I tried to talk to the manager but by then my family went to go to the car. I waited though and when he eventually did come over he wasn't interested in a word I had to say. I finished by explaining my family will NEVER come back and his response was 'well OK' and then left. What the heck? Hands down the most insulting experience I've ever had in any restaurant. Rude lady tending bar tossed my change at the table and exclaimed she doesn't want my change? My daughter was in tears by the time I got back to our car because she felt everyone was staring at her. I have come to this place several times in the past because its close to our house and when it first opened it was a different atmosphere and it was good. Modern Grove has fallen far, far down. The staff seem so uptight and not at all happy with their jobs. They have definitely seen the last of my family's money. Too bad, I don't think it will be around much longer."}
{"text":"Over priced under flavored food, wouldn't go back. Try Red, white and Brew if you want delicious food for reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Food is very good, quick service, great prices also!   Bacon cheddar burger is really good and their sweet potato fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. We went twice: once in December, and again in February. Both times the service wasn't too friendly, the food was mediocre and overpriced, and we stood at the counter for at least three minutes waiting for someone to take our order. The place has really cute decor and a nice patio with string globe lights and artificial grass. It has so much potential."}
{"text":"Foods om. Staff needs some work. Walked in after I called in my order to find two girls standing there talking, with no one in the restaraunt and they didn't even start my order. Also table were dirty with plates, again, not busy at all. Things would be different if I was manager."}
{"text":"We went to Modern Grove for the first time on Saturday.  The fig, goat cheese and ham pizza is very good.  The Reuben panini was cheesy and excellent.  The strawberry chicken salad was fresh and my wife loved it.  Our waitress was attentive and made good recommendations.  Eating outside at a slat-wood table was perfect. Definitely going again.  Prices are reasonable for a gastro pub."}
{"text":"The staff was welcoming and friendly, I was excited to see they offer portobello mushroom caps as a burger bun alternative, but didn't end up having any. Bummer. But I ended up getting a lettuce wrapped burger and it was delicious! The decor is awesome. When the staff is awesome, your drinks are always refilled and the decor makes you warm inside you can get over the whole mushroom bun thing  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times and every time I kept saying to my family let's give them another chance they need to work out the kinks. But I feel like they just don't get it?? The food is flavorless! How can u not season your food? Mayb do a taste test for quality control.  I'm done eating here and spending too much money on less then mediocre food. Maybe they need to fire the chefs (if that's what they really are) and hire more experienced chefs. Or just try some salt and pepper!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Just what this part of town needed.  I usually have to drive 20 minutes for this type of experience.  I'm sure I'm biased because I can ride my bike here, but it's really a great spot.    They have a cox WiFi hotshot that you can sign into for really fast Internet.  They have about anything you feel like on the menu."}
{"text":"I had the Roast panini. The meat was tender but the sandwich was rather flavorless. Not sure where the tangy horseradish sauce was either. My boyfriend's Cubano panini was ok but neither one of them was worth the price. Not planning on going back."}
{"text":"I wish the food was as good as the decor! We live in the area and were excited about trying out what could have been a neat little place close to home.  We were both disappointed.  We ordered a Shroom burger and a chicken panini and requested 1/2 & 1/2 fries (half regular and half sweet potato) as sides for both. We also decided to split a cinnamon roll.  We were the first to order in a long line of people coming in for lunch.  The table that ordered behind us got served first.   Normally not a big deal (maybe their food was quicker to prepare),  but we could clearly see our food sitting on the shelf under the heat lamp waiting to be delivered.    The fries that came with both sandwiches were regular fries and not 1/2 & 1/2. Instead of just bringing us a side of sweet potato fries while we started on our food, the server took one of our sandwich plates back to the kitchen (for yet more hot lamp time!) to change the fries.  I requested the burger be medium and it was pinkless and dry. The mushrooms were tasty when I picked them out with a fork, but there were entirely too few of them to make a difference when combined with the bland bun and overcooked meat.  The chicken sandwich had some sort of cheese or something on it that had congealed into a mass with the chicken chunks.  I'm assuming because it cooled down while sitting around waiting to be delivered and while it was heading back to the kitchen to get the correct fries.   The red pasty spread on the panini bread wasn't good either.   The cinnamon roll was nice to look at, but was dried out inside and pretty tasteless.  When the server came around to clear our plates (with lots of uneaten food on both plates) I told her about each of our issues and was offered an unapologetic \"Gee, I hope you come back again because we'll do better next time\" or something along those lines.  I doubt we'll be going back.  A new place should be concerned about an unfavorable review and making things right. I get that places have off days, but when there's an off day a genuine apology should be given and an effort made to make the experience better. In my opinion, no effort was made to satisfy either of those conditions on this visit."}
{"text":"my wife and I visited the first week they opened. Menu looked good, drinks were good, but service was horrible . Other 2 couples in party got their food but we didn't. Went up to check on it and tried to straighten out the issue only to find out they gave our food to others.  we finally got our food about 20mins later than the rest of the table. Manager didn't seem too apologetic for the issue - offered no comps.  We live down the street but will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Ok, so I was really excited for a hip, tasty restaurant in this area. Sadly, I don't know if this one quite fits the bill. It's a tad over-priced when compared to comparable restaurants like Postino and Liberty Market. Additionally, their highlighted appetizer is their Mac and cheese bites with bacon cheese sauce. Now, I'm a big fan of fried mac and cheese and have tried them at pretty much every restaurant that I can, but these were a disappointment. The panko breading was overwhelming, there was no discernible cheese in the actual balls themselves, and the bacon cheese sauce was bland cheese with a small sprinkling of bacon on top. Ten bucks buys you four 1.5 inch diameter balls that are dry and flavorless inside and a bland cheese sauce to dip them in. Overall, a super let down.  On top of them being lackluster in the flavor department, was the fact that from where I sat, I could see them and the rest of our meal sitting under the heat lamp for 10 solid minutes while other meals were being happily taken to their diners' tables. I could see all the glorious steam leaving our pizza as it sat there. Why did they just leave it there, you ask? Because, for some strange reason, they decided to bring our appetizer, meal, and dessert all at the same time. So they left our food to sit while they waited for our bread pudding to be prepared.  The pizza and bread pudding were both better than the mac and cheese bites, but the bread pudding needs something lighter to balance out the chocolate and caramel, maybe whipped cream, or some sort of berry. I'm all for rich desserts, but this was a bit much for me.  All that being said, I feel like for the price, it's just not going to hit the mark. The ambiance is pleasant, and the food is going in the right direction, but still needs refining. We'll try again in a couple years when they've had time to get in their groove."}
{"text":"Came back again and ordered the equivalent of a bacon cheese burger. I asked for bleu cheese and I'm pretty certain I got feta. The patty was handmade (huge plus) but had an odd taste that lacked flavor and tasted somewhat like fuel. My wife ordered a salad. It looked really good but for close to $12, I believe it fell quite short, in comparison to what you can expect from Oregano's (locally owned) and Pita Jungle (locally owned). The interior and exterior of this place is on point. The food, however, significantly falls short of the price point. If they would step up their game, they could have a unique concept that could easily branch out across AZ. Let's see some magic!!"}
{"text":"Very good, fun restaurant.  Food is imaginative takes on classics.  Fun outdoor seating.  Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a pleasant surprise. I've eaten there many times and have not been disappointed. My favorite is the strawberry chicken salad. You get a generous portion that includes goat cheese, strawberries and turkey. The hamburgers are also very good. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little hangout. I have come here twice for late lunch. And haven't been disappointed. The place is pretty crowded for dinners on weekends so I can't speak to food quality or service during those times. We tried mac&cheese bites which were decent. The chorizo kale pizza is scrumptious & filling. Husband had the bacon cheeseburger and they cooked to perfection. The quinoa bowl is good but spicy so watch out . They serve beers on tap & bottles, wines, great ice tea & coffees. Good concept and great eatery desperately needed in this area."}
{"text":"Modern grove burned my eggs and gave my son alcohol tasting syrup.  It was very liquidy and smelled of alcohol. When I complained, there was barely an apology. I was incredulous. Food is expensive and very fair in taste. Waffles were very bland tasting and weak. Apple juice looks great but I saw them pour it from a plastic bottle from the grocery store. Facade. Fake. When I asked for additional butter, they said they ran out. Really? Who runs out of butter during breakfast??? Very disappointing. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is just what our neighborhood needed. The food is good and they have good beer on tap. It is fun to see all the neighbors riding their bikes up there. We meet someone new each time we go. So glad to have them within walking distance.  Oh did I mention we love the staff!!!! The already remember us and great us by name."}
{"text":"Consistently one of my favorite places. Some plates are a better value than others. The flats are tasty but come without a side. Sandwiches and salads are more filling for the price. Super fresh food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow this place great when it opened now very disappointing  Pizza with no topping when I asked they said that the way we make it The owner needs some better training"}
{"text":"Had the gluten-free margarita pizza and it was very good - unfortunately it was too expensive to make it worth returning."}
{"text":"My burger was decent.  Only has lettuce tomato bacon and cheese. Could have been seasoned better. Love the local beers on draft. KILTLIFTER!! :) perfect portion sizes. A little over priced. I would probably come back to have a few beers at the bar. Probably not for the food. This place is super close the my house and 6 bucks for a local craft beer is right up my alley. Great ambiance and the staff were friendly enough. Staff didn't follow up on the table after the food was delivered. That is something that should be considered. I hope this place sticks around--nice trendy spot in old, tired, Mormon Mesa."}
{"text":"So glad for the change...I adore the little outside eating area as well as the design in general! The panini's are delicious..End of story"}
{"text":"I had hoped this place would be a cool new little spot in a part of Mesa that desperately needs a cocktails and funky-food joint. Unfortunately, this was just an overpriced, no- chef-on-site,chain restaurant. The prices will keep me away because you get the quality of fast food at the cost of a boutique upscale eatery."}
{"text":"Place is ok if you're looking for a burger and don't want a \"fast food\" one. I've come a few times but every time I do the prices go up... Kinda disappointing. Same food just pricer."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to going. Wanted breakfast, they stop serving at 11, except Sunday's. Got there at 11:06, so ordered lunch. After being opened only 21 days, they had a surly order taker.  Ordered a GF Margherita pizza, asked to include Feta. Got a barely cooked crust with not enough sauce and Only Feta cheese. My husband and teen remarked that the $11 burger was \"just OK. \" SmashBurgers tastes better for less. After serving our meal, no one bothered to follow up. \"Surly Boy\" went outside to smoke on his break. A pesty fly buzzed about throughout meal. We had to continuously fan it away. No one seemed to notice. One older gent possibly mgr/owner? Spent a lot of time talking to other older diners and conveniently ignored us. We spent $45 for two just ok burgers, fries, one lemonade and a joke of a pizza. Never returning. Will keep waiting for a great, fun restaurant in tired old Mesa. This is all flash and no substance."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, but it's a bit pricey for what you get. Seems like they're trying to tap into the fancy-food trend but the 3 slices of tomato and mozzarella that make up the caprese dish shouldn't cost $10... That being said, it's a lovely place to meet friends, sit outside, and have a glass of wine. It's oddly located away from other similar nightlife establishments in a residential area of Mesa which makes it very accessible and not crowded."}
{"text":"Love the new menu. Better selection, better prices. There is a great happy hour too. Staff is very nice. There is a separate bar area and nice patio area to eat outside. Love the salads. I've never seen it crowded so fast service."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far and just took carry out for lunch! I ordered the white pizza. It didn't let me down. It had great flavor. I'm interested in checking out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend, the atmosphere is nice we sat outside I ordered the ABC Chicken Sandwich it was delicious. the food was as good as it looks!! Highly recommend (:"}
{"text":"Cute, family friendly little place. We've enjoyed most everything we've tried. The only item I deemed inedible was one of the daily soups. My biggest complaint about this place: NO flexibility with the menu options. I've never been denied so many special (minor) requests. Most restaurants seem to try and be a little more accommodating. For example, they serve sweet potato fries here, which my son loves. The kids meal comes with a choice of sides, like regular fries or fruit. On our first visit, I asked for sweet potato fries with the kids meal. Apparently, it's only available as a side for the regular menu. I understand they may cost more, but even offering to pay more for sweet potato fries was not an option. Wait. What?! You refuse to sell me what I want? I came up with a creative solution. My daughter likes a sandwich off of the regular menu and my son prefers regular fries. So, I order my son's kids item with regular fries and my daughter's sandwich with sweet potato fries. Then when the food comes out I simply swap the fries between the kids. Problem solved but still kind of annoying. On our visit this week, I asked for a side of mac 'n cheese which is a kids menu item.  After sampling it off of my kids' plate on a previous visit, I decided I wanted a side of it to have with some fresh fruit. But guess what? They wouldn't sell it to me. They have great fresh brewed flavored teas here. They also serve alcohol, including unique beer. Great to drink away your sorrow of not being able to order what you want."}
{"text":"If you live in the area, and love chic, trendy, upscale, cool restaurants, check  out Modern Grove.  From restored wood interior to gourmet menu, this place has the ambiance and the quality food. This is the most awesome  place in the immediate area. I am so escatic  to have this place nearby. Chic places like this bring up house values! Yeah  it's not a super cheap  place, but you pay for the atmosphere. I will be here a lot to support more trendy  places in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant was pretty average as far as the food goes. I had the Strawberry Chicken Salad, which was tasty but did not fill me up as an entree. My husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger with sweet potato fries as a side. He said it was pretty good but not memorable and definitely not one of the best he has had. The sweet potato fries tasted good. Our kids had a Pepperoni Pizza, which they enjoyed, but our kids will eat any pizza put in front of them. On the bright side, the staff was very friendly from the start, and our waitress was super attentive. We also had the chips and queso appetizer, and even with all of the food we ordered, all of us left the restaurant still hungry. I think the prices are high for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Awesome venue for our neighborhood! Nice selection of wine; however, some reds should be chilled (all bottles on shelves were warm)! Shared a bottle of chilled white wine, modern hummus and brushetta board! Excellent service from Tyler and manager Don Moore was engaging! Very easy to spend time on the patio enjoying every morsel and sip of wine!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited on a beautiful Sunday morning in October 2016 and took advantage of the outdoor seating. Though the decor inside is great, we just wanted to enjoy the outside as the temperature was in the low 70's. Both inside and out, the restaurant is very clean and modern with an upscale ambiance. Even the plates and little fruit serving dishes are upscale.  The service was superb. It came complete with a never empty cup filled with a smooth blend of coffee that perfectly accompanied the breakfast. I had the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, avocado and cheese with a side of fruit for $8.00. My wife had the breakfast scramble with a side of breakfast potatoes and toast for $9.50. Mine was delicious. My wife's portion was so huge that I got to try it too. It was also delicious. I consider this restaurant a great find and will return soon."}
{"text":"It's nice to have an option so close because there's not much around this neighborhood in terms of restaurants. Unfortunately it's not a great option. The food is just OK, nothing special. The customer service is probably the biggest thing lacking at this place. Whoever came up with their operational systems was clearly high or under the influence of something. Forget about ordering food while you're in the bar. You have to walk up to the front counter yourself, order, pay for it and then walk back to the bar. They're trying to mix a fast food and dine-in restaurant - but they do it horribly.   They don't have a full bar. Just cheap wine that's overpriced, warm drought beer they poor with a three inch head and a few can options of local breweries.   Drive a few miles in either direction and you can find something better, I'm sure."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood place to grab a bite to eat.  Staff is friendly.  Food is good.  Not a lot of choices if you are a vegetarian.  There is one veggie sandwich.  I would stick with a salad or pizza.  Music is super loud and you can't really enjoy a conversation.  Sit outside if you can!"}
{"text":"I just left so annoyed I'm knocking a star off my review.  I still give it 3 stars, because my salad is delicious, but the overall experience left something to be desired.  Here's the recap:  I order their strawberry salad to go.  When I arrived, there was no one in line, there was just a couple sitting at a table waiting on food, and another group or two eating.  After I ordered a group of 3 came in and placed an order.  These were the only customers. The place was pretty slow.  After waiting about 15+ minutes, I'm starting to wonder what's up.  It can't take that long to make a salad and they're not busy.  Maybe they had to grill the chicken?  Finally the cashier notices I'm still standing around.  \"Are you waiting on something?\" She asks.  \"Yes, my salad.\" I reply.  \"What salad?\" she says.  Keep in mind, this is the same lady who took my order, and has only taken one other order (that group of 3) since I came in.  \"Um, the strawberry salad? That I ordered to go?\"  \"Oh, okay, I'll check on that for you.\"  She then proceeds to go to the kitchen, get food for the one couple that had ordered before me, meander back to the kitchen, and then ask the cook about it.  I can hear his response: \"Yeah, I was just working on that, can you hand me a to-go container?\"  She hands him the container and he proceeds to make my salad in under 3 minutes.  And then, when he places it on the counter, ready, she continues for another few minutes writing a customer name on a to-go bag (for for that isn't even ready yet) when she knows I'm waiting on the salad that IS NOW READY TO GO.  She finally finishes that, then takes her time filling a container of dressing for me (as if she couldn't have done that earlier?!).  By the time I've gotten my salad it's been almost 20 minutes.  The chicken was pre-cooked and the strawberries were pre-sliced.  There was literally NO prep time.  So basically, they let me stand around waiting for 20 minutes for a salad to go, that takes less than 5 minutes to make and could have easily been put together while the one other order ahead of me (burgers) were cooking on the grill.  Then to add insult to injury, to stand there doodling on a bag when my salad is ready and I'm right there waiting for it (and have been for long enough time that you had forgotten my order all together).    To be fair, I don't think this level of customer service is indicative of the business as a whole.  I think it was just a bad day (or maybe a bad combo of employees who happened to be working).  I would encourage others to check it out, at least once.  But I'm not going out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a burger during their 1st anniversary special with a group of family, including a toddler.  What a pleasant surprise!  Very family-friendly place with great service.  We shared the pretzels and the bruschetta as appetizers.  The bruschetta were good, but I absolutely loved the pretzels and cheese.  They were warm, just the right amount of salt and an awesome cheese sauce - freshly made, not canned or bottled.  So good, we ordered more!  The special was burger, side and soft drink for $5, so we all ordered the burgers.  Too many places overcook their burgers, making them dry and tasteless.  At MG, you are able to order the level of doneness.  Mine was medium rare and very juicy and flavorful.  The fries were fresh and had quite a few that were a little crisp - just how I like them.  My husband and I returned a couple of weeks later for dinner.  What we love is the outdoor seating.  We will always choose a restaurant where we can sit outside over other places.  What surprised us was that we had the same server and she remember us and what we had ordered on the previous visit.  Very impressive!  This time, I tried the Reuben sandwich and my husband had a salad with salami and cheese.  Both were very good.  We also enjoyed the wine - it was moderately priced and very nice.  We love having this restaurant in our neighborhood.  If you know anything about Mesa, you'll recognize that having a neighborhood restaurant (not a national chain), especially one where you can sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sunset, is a rarity.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited two times. Nice atmosphere...Very nice employees.  Food is nothing special. Over priced. Takes a long time to get your food. Both times I have been there I have paid the $7.00 for chips and queso and both times it was hardly even warm. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The food is great!!!!! Nothing even close to being as good in all of Mesa. The live music tonight is great.  The look and feel inside and out is so rad.  I won't change a thing and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. It's apparent that the five star reviews are from friends/family. I had a bacon cheeseburger and my wife had the chicken wrap something or another.   I ordered the burger medium. What I got was burnt on the outside and dark gray on the inside. This burger was so hot I had to wait 10 minutes just to eat it... And it was still nuclear hot. There is no way it got that hot, and stayed that hot, being cooked on the grill. I think it was microwaved. Hands down one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  My wife's chicken something or another wasn't much better. It was also nuclear hot. This poor chicken died just to be half eaten and the rest discarded. It was so dry that it had that stickiness to it. You know... When you bite down and it has that weird texture that makes your teeth stick together.   We also had the Mac and Cheese bites. They were ok. Nothing special.  It's really too bad about this place. We were really excited about having someplace good, and relevant, in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, we'll just have to wait a little longer for something else to come along."}
{"text":"Cute local restaurant. Tried Gobbler burger with fruit....with a Sanpellegrino =$15!!!! WITH?! Burger was bland, unimpressive. I had to drown it in mustard. Service was sub par; guess it takes too much effort to smile. Oh well. Hope the other location is better. Not giving it a try though."}
{"text":"Not quite sure where all the five star reviewers ate!!! You could get better food in a hospital cafeteria! If you build it, they will come... But likely only once!"}
{"text":"Modern grove is a very nice and different type of restaurant, it is long overdue in mesa seeing as there are no other restaurants of its type and the employees are very friendly with incredible food and awesome appetizers. They also feature a bar which had a good selection of beer and wine"}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in the neighborhood. Good food, friendly staff and great atmosphere. It was our first time so we tried multiple menu items and were impressed by everything. I am totally becoming a regular of Modern Grove."}
{"text":"It's great to finally have a new healthy restaurant in this area of Mesa.  Everything I've tried I've loved!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I have been a few times because it's near my house and I really wanted to like it. The service (or lack there of) is embarrassing. The staff were not friendly and we had to wait a really long time for someone to even acknowledge us to take our order. The food could make up for the service but it's really not good and super over priced. I gave it 2 stars because it's a decent cafe if you're in a pinch but I definitely will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great decor awesome outdoor seating. I had the tuna sandwich. It lacked tuna and the bread fell apart as soon as i picked it up. I had to go back in and ask for a fork to eat it. Sweet potato fires were delicious! Serve yourself coffee area didn't even have cream or milk just little fake sweetener pods. The guy working may have been new...he seemed confused and unsure when asked a question. For all the hype about fresh healthy food they really need to step up their quality or lower their prices."}
{"text":"LOVE!  Very refreshing menu. Good mix of food. (They did mess up a takeout order but comped it on my next time I came to dine in and were great about it).  I have been itching to go back again."}
{"text":"Today me and my beautiful wife tried this place for lunch.  The place has a good vibe.  It has a little store that looks like it sells local stuff, i think?  I didn't look to much at that section because i usually don't buy stuff like that.    There is a bar inside that sells beer only as of now.  They do have a liquor license and plan to sell some soon.  They are also looking at having a happy hour, woohoo. We need more HH around here.    I had the tuna sandwich with fries.  It was a good sandwich.  Nothing really special on it and it was the right size.  Wife had the cubano with pasta salad.  It was also a good sandwich.  Both sandwiches were a little pricey i think?   I had a beer with lunch, it was the grove ale which was good.  The small,16 oz was $4 and the large, 23oz was $5. I'll take the large please.      If they were to have a lunch special and happy hour it will be a 5 star place.  I think once they have a happy hour i will be frequenting the joint."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this restaurant open.  Mesa so desperately needs more little cafe type places with good quality, fresh food.    We went there for lunch today and the menu looked good, lots of variety.  We settled on the Classic Chicken Caesar and the Shroom's burger.    The Caesar salad was supposed to come with oven roasted chicken.  The chicken we got had absolutely no color on it and no flavor.  If it were oven roasted, I would expect the outside to be seasoned and brown and the chicken to be juicy and flavorful.  The chicken we got was all white, dry, tough and flavorless.  It looked and tasted like boiled chicken.  The dressing was fine - there was WAY too much of it on the salad - but even the dressing couldn't help the bland, tough chicken.  The salad was just meh.    My daughter ordered the Shroom's burger and said the flavor was good.  Her issue was that the bun was 4 x the size of the burger.  They asked how she wanted the burger cooked and she said medium.  However, the burger was so flat, the only way it could be cooked was well done.  She said the mushrooms were tasty but, the bun completely overwhelmed the burger.   I also think it was pretty pricey for both the area as well as for what you got."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio with the great weather and quite. GOOD service, food was excellent and with good size portions!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks and hospitality were fabulous.  The manager was very accompanying as well as our bartender.  From my understanding it is undergoing a new concept. I was never there before, this one is great!  I would highly recommend it, very posh place."}
{"text":"First and Foremost....this place is great! I just want to get that out there before anyone thinks I am trying to be a negative Nancy...This place popped up seemingly out of the blue and is in my old neighborhood .  It has great atmosphere , simple menu and great drink offerings (including beer and wine) .  Seating is really cool and simple, this is a \"Fast Casual\" dining experience, so you will order your food, get a number and be given your drink and they bring the food to you. My wife and I both ordered the same thing \" The Roast\" Pannini which has several heaping slices of mid-rare steak with cheese and a creamy horseradish sauce. I had regular fries and my wife had sweet potato fries.  The bread was amazing and perfectly grilled. Everything  else was up to par and tasty (nearly perfect)  with ONE exception...The steak was totally bland nd lacked all seasoning on both mine and my wifes .  That said, there was plenty there and they had plenty of extra hot sauces available that helped give it a bit more season.  For the price, and quality, I give this place a 4 out of 5 stars and we will deff be returning (prob often ).  Note to the chef , work on that seasoning the steak."}
{"text":"Used to live in the neighborhood and frequent our favorite Zoyo which is next door to Modern Grove. Temperatures were warming and on our last trip to the Z we discovered the Grove. Wife and I are amateur foodies\"and won't hesitate to drive 50 miles to try something new so we put MG on our calendar. We took the 6 mile drive last night and were really looking forward to it just from what we had seen from the outside. We arrived and it was a lovely evening with all of the outdoor tables occupied by couples and families. Ok must be good. Love the decor and the \"vibe\" of this place which this old neighborhood could really use. Upon ordering the staff was courteous.  So we settle on the pretzels for an app and Cubano panini, my wife orders the strawberry chicken salad. Checked out the wines and beers but decided we'd focus on the food since the price points are a little high basically a sandwich shop so we settle on a water and soda. Given our number card and found a lovely table by the front window.   Pretzels arrived quickly with a honey mayo sauce and a good spicy mustard. Pretzels were good and for $7 they better be. No sooner than getting halfway through the first, our main courses arrive.  Mine- Cubano is layered with cheese, ham and turkey, but you wouldn't know that unless you opened it up since it was missing half of the meat a panini should have. What it should have been called is the Slice Dill Pickle panini. On first bite that is all you taste, pickle. I quickly removed it to salvage my sandwich but too late. It was soaked in it's juices. I got through the first half and I was done. Finished my pretzels. Wife-Strawberry chicken salad you can't go wrong with but this place did. First the chicken breast chunks were large and plenty of them but look like they were boiled! This bland white look with no seasoning whatsoever. Good mix of other greens but she had to physically dig to see if any dressing had been added because she couldn't taste any. After a couple bites she was done and finished her pretzel. So we got containers to go and she would doctor it up when we got home. 2 stars are for ambiance only. $35 tab for this was absurd. Not all was lost though. Walked into Zoyo and had one good thing to eat that evening. Being the only game in the hood won't guarantee you'll survive in this business. Better get it together."}
{"text":"Bye Bye Hollywood Video and Hello Modern Grove.  I LOVE that this place is here.  Why you ask?  Well, it is right dead in the middle of Mesa.  If you know anything about Mesa it is filled with houses, houses and more houses.  Unless it is a huge corporate restruant we usually don't have a lot of eateries.  Also, the feel of this place is very urban.  I feel like I am over on Mill in Tempe or some posh place in downtown Phoenix but instead I am just down the street from my house.    The food is delicious.  I have ordered several different dishes.  The most recent time we started things off right with Pretzels and Beer Dip.  Although I am not fan of tangy mustards, I couldn't get enough of that stuff.  Something about it was just so right with the cheese dip.  Next up for me was the Napa Pizza.  Oh the onions on it were amazing with the ham.  Together all the ingredients made the perfect combinations of flavors that just fit so right!     Truth be told I am quite torn about giving this place 4 or 5 stars.  However, I am going to settle with 4.  The food is wonderful and honestly I don't think it can be much better than it is.  I just feel like it shouldn't cost so much.   The atmosphere just feels like it should be cheaper and I think it would be if it was located in Tempe, or Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went with my hubby for dinner on a Saturday night. I have to say that I am a foodie and have very high expectations...that being said, after this first experience, I almost didn't go back (Read another review about my 2nd experience). I ordered a steak panini and he got a burger. Pieces of meat were thick and overcooked and had no seasoning. Sweet potato fries had no taste at all. My husband's burger was not tasty or juicy. Service was attentive and friendly but the food was NOT good! Overpriced, underseasoned and not properly cooked. As excited as we are to have a fast casual restaurant in the area I do not feel like it hit the mark."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Service-The guy seemed genuinely interested in the food and offered the anniversary special, their burger, fries and a drink (8 different teas, kinda cool) for 5 bucks!  Food-Awesome burger, great bun selection, nice presentation, cooked perfectly (I'm a burger foodie, LOL).  Fries. Usually don't care much for fries but they were fresh, hot and not over seasoned, nice!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Save your money.  I ordered a salad and it was not great at all. Poor taste. I also ordered a hot vanilla latte made by the manager which was maybe room temp and when I said it was not hot at all, the manager took it back and warmed it up in the microwave. Really!? Never eating here again."}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was delicious.  Excellent food and atmosphere.  Located NW Brown and Gilbert Rd."}
{"text":"This new restaurant, owned by the same guy who owns Zoyo Ice Cream right next door, is in our neighborhood and on our list of places to try.  Any other restaurant review I've given has generally been about the food, because that's what really counts at a restaurant, right?  Well, we didn't get the chance to try their food because of the clock.  We entered the restaurant at 10:55 am.  We were both impressed with the appearance of the facility.  Given menus by a very friendly young lady at the counter we made our selections and returned to the counter to order.  My wife wanted the margherita pizza but had noticed the menu note that stated it was served after 11:00 am.  It was now 10:57 am.  My wife asked the young lady if it was okay to order her pizza now.  The counter girl turned to one of the cooks behind her and asked the same question.  \"Not 'til after 11:00 am,\" he shouted back to her.  \"Sorry,\" said counter girl.  We stepped away from the counter to discuss our options.  The only real option was to depart without spending our money.  As a long time marketing manager with heavy emphasis on customer service I have to ask what would it have taken for the counter girl and/or the cook to say, \"Sure!  We'd be happy to take your order.\"  I mean, we're talking three minutes early.  They didn't even have to start making the darn thing until 11:01 am and we never would have known.  Instead, they stuck to their rules and in the end lost our business, forever.  Having said that, based on reviews of this location and the Tatum Road one, I don't think we're missing anything.  Too bad owners won't train their staff to take care of the customer.  First impressions last a long time."}
{"text":"Split q lunch at modern grove. Had the mac & cheese bites and pizza Bianca. Decor is cute if not your standard for a fast casual hipster place. Order at the counter and get a number, food is delivered, full bar in the back, self serve fountain sodas in dining room along with a cooler of bottled drinks and small assortment of specialty grocery items.   Mac & cheese bites were a little bland in their own but tasty with the cheese bacon dipping sauce. The pizza was too big for a single person but not quite enough to share without ordering an appetizer. The prosciutto was more a basic lunch meat ham then traditional prosciutto. The cook also had a heavy hand with the meat, more isn't always better. The crust was thoroughly cooked with dark brown coloring on the bottom but tasted doughy and under done.  Over all the look is good, the menu sounds great but the actual food isn't impressive and is a tad over priced."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. The Executive chef personally walked me through my gluten-free options (besides their GF pizza). Dog friendly too on patio/lawn and occasionally has live music on weekends."}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  Quality and service subpar.  Minimal selection of bar food."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this most  unique and out if the way place. I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. The outside eating area has been shady and cool so far this warm spring.  I have offered the same thing twice the apple chicken salad sandwich on whole grain bread. It is simply the best one around. I have been craving chicken salad sandwiches and went to chick fila and paradise bakery and ended up here again today. The amount of food is amazing and the chicken salad is excellent.   The staff is very friendly and eager to help and serve your needs"}
{"text":"Delightful atmosphere, friendly service and tasty food! I had the bacon avocado cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite. Mesa is SO lucky to get the 2nd location of Modern Grove. We are so excited its right in our neighborhood. Everything we have tried so far has been delicious...Pretzels and cheese, hummus and veggies, breakfast sandwiches, bruschetta boards...I want to try all of it. The atmosphere is awesome...cute and modern design, laid back and comfortable, perfect place to relax in the morning or hang out late with friends. Staff is super friendly, attentive, and cool. The patio area is fantastic...I only wish my backyard looked like this!!! First week and we've been her twice already...the only question is how many times we can fit this in evey week from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location but they are struggling with service. It seems like they don't have enough business to attract good help. What comes first, good service or a busy restaurant? This place has a cool factor in appearance and atmosphere but it just needs a boost. I do like the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Good burger, nice ambiance, but cost accountants are picking the ingredients. I asked if they offered whole wheat bread, and was served white multi grain. Fruit side was tiny and not good. Restaurant has healthy pretensions, but its all fake. Executives are too greedy."}
{"text":"I wanted something good that was not fast food. That is quite the challenge when your only option for medium sit down quality food in north mesa is Outback or Serranos. This place was surprisingly good. I had the modern turkey and  french fries.  I intend to come back here in the very near future."}
{"text":"Listen up people, Modern Grove is now not only delicious food; it's also MUCH less expensive!  They have slashed their prices and maintained the same impeccable food quality.  While they no longer serve pizza, the menu is great and they have added a few more items at VERY reasonable costs.   Modern Grove is a quaint place to hang out and relax. It's a no-brainer and we go almost every Sunday.   Here's a tip: if you fail to get the Mac and Cheese balls, you can blame yourself!  Do not skip them!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times hoping that it would get better, as it's so close. The best thing I have had is the beer. The quality of food is dismal and really should be looked into especially because it's priced like as if it's high quality."}
{"text":"Best customer service I have had in a while :-) please had the best medium rare burger ever :-)"}
{"text":"I love having a local place where we can go to eat that's close by. I love the dog friendly atmosphere and the fake grass outside where Fido can lay down. The food is very good and the speed is also fine. I do have a gripe with the price of the food as I feel it is out of line for the area. The last time I was there I ordered too cinnamon rolls and the guy behind the counter told me he was sorry they only had one because it's so slow they only make two and one of them had already been sold.???  Lastly I want to mention that most the food that was on the shelving to the left of where you order, was out of date --meaning it was expired -- so before you buy from them make sure you check the dates. I want to love this place so close to my house but even after multiple visits, I'm not feeling the vibe!"}
{"text":"This place is a refreshing addition to Mesa And just what the area needed. Great spot for lunch, drinks, or coffee. We took our grandmother here for lunch and she loved it just as much as we did. The owner was also a nice fellow who moved a table from across the patio just because we ordered too much food for the 3 of us and needed more Space!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for lunch. We ordered the Mac and Cheese bites and two paninis.   The Mac and Cheese bites were frozen in the middle .   I had the chicken panini, and it was flavorless. The chicken wasn't fresh (tastes like the pre-cooked and cut chicken you find in the freezer isle at the grocery store).   My sister got a fruit salad for her side, and it a literally 6 pieces of cantaloupe.   I'm not too sure why they have so much staff, they don't do anything. It's not like the place is super busy.   The pricing is kind of outrageous and not worth it at all. I was hoping for fresh quality ingredients, but everything taste like it came out of a freezer. The set up and presentation is cute, but don't let that fool you. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the marguerita pizza. It was delicious! Service is great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great spot for sandwiches in Mesa/Gilbert. The quality of the meats they use is phenomenal, and their  breads are really soft and substantial.   The atmosphere is typical modern chic- smooth cement pour structures, astro-turf grass that feels good on the feet and nice picnic benches and places to sit and eat- both in and out of the shade.   A good refreshing place!"}
{"text":"Modern Grove is my new favorite go-to for delicious, healthy food in Mesa. Everything I've tried has been great (the bruscetta board and their chicken salad sandwich are highlights for me) and the service is always great. It's a bit pricey though, otherwise I'd give it a full five stars. Definitely check them out, you won't be disappointed for fresh, healthy options in Mesa."}
{"text":"Good food, cool vibe. A little pricier than I'd like but we need more of these type of places in Mesa. The burger is solid and the pizza is also enjoyable.   My wife has dietary restrictions and they were super accommodating today."}
{"text":"When we first moved here I was really excited to try this place. We went the other day and I love the great decor and outdoor seating area. Menu has a nice healthy variety but I agree with everyone pricey for what it is. It would be nice to see \"local grassfed beef\", local produce or organic lettuce in the salads even at this price.  Helpful staff, but lagged a little while they talked to their friends in the back bar area didn't like that much and because the family booth is used as an employee table. Also, didn't know outside drinks were allowed to be out in restaurant I thought that was against health code?  Otherwise, it was alright, probably return to the neighborhood spot because it's close and healthier option."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great the food is meh. My husband and  have been there two or three times and it's been mediocre each time. Go somewhere else. :("}
{"text":"I really want to love this place as it is close to my house, super cute and dog friendly. But, they just can't seem to get it right. I keep giving it a try but it falls short every time. I like to eat healthy and it's hard to find something good and light here. The salads are weak. They need to get some lessons on salads from Pita Jungle or even CPK. I think their burgers and pizza are decent so a good place to go if you don't care about calories and want a cute local place with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Super cute place! Food is ok, but WAY overpriced!! I work a 1/2 mile away but this place is too expense to go for lunch.."}
{"text":"I started writing this review while sitting on their adorable patio tonight, in the dark, when my phone died. Why was it dark? Because they closed early and turned off all the lights, even though there were customers sitting on the side patio.   Let's start this off from the beginning. This was my first time here, along with a friend. We were excited to try something new. We were quickly told to pick a seat, inside or outside, and were given menus. We chose outside because it's been a beautiful, randomly cool day in April. Our waitress, Gretchen, was super nice and informative. Our food was amazing (vegan quinoa bowl for me; cheeseburger and fries for my friend; peach tea for both; and the pretzels to share). Everything was fresh, cooked well, tasted delicious and just overall really good. We were given a box to go for my leftovers, and offered to-go refills of our tea. Yay, bonus points for that. Then it got weird.   The cute little lights over the patio went out. We looked inside to see a worker turning them off. The time on the door says they're open until 8. It's just before 7. Huh? Our server comes out once more to clear the last glass on our table and we ask about closing early, without notice. She says that since they're slow, sometimes they close early. We both say \"huh\" and that's the end of that. Another server comes out and talks to the other set of customers behind us. One of those poor ladies has to chug her glass of wine because they're closing.   Honestly, this place would have gotten 5 stars from me. But to give no notice to the paying customers already there that you're closing an hour early? What in the world?! We had talked about getting dessert, but, nevermind. Since it was our first time there, I wanted to check out the marketplace as well as the huge blackboard in the back of the restaurant with entertainment and info listed. A huge worry/safety issue was that the young lady that was there to completely close by herself kept the doors unlocked while she counted the drawer. Then she locked up and exited from the back. She was outta there by 7:23."}
{"text":"We had gone to this restaurant when it first opened and was fairly disappointed. It was over-priced and under-delivered. The food was meh.   We returned about a week ago because we were in a hurry and there was a sign saying 'under new management'. We hoped for the best, but weren't expecting much.   It was a Friday night during the dinner rush and the place was empty. Kinda sad. We ordered a salad, burger and fries to share. The salad came out first and was thoroughly disappointing. The spicy chipotle ranch dressing did not go at all with the soft dark spinach greens they chose. It would have been much better had they chosen a fresh, crunchy lettuce like romaine.   Needless to say, at this point we were regretting our decision to stop here. Then the burger and fries came out. They were nice enough to cut it for us knowing we were splitting it. The burger was surprisingly tasty. It was really good. It was a classic burger, so nothing out of the ordinary with ingredients, but they cooked it well and it tasted fresh. With the fries, they lightly coated them in batter before frying (or something like that) and they were extra crispy and hot. Soooo good. The main course definitely exceeded our expectations.   My mind is still not made up about this place. It seems hit or miss. I feel like they're close and are improving the menu, but unless they change more and people start noticing, I'm afraid it's going to close. Which is a shame, because this area needs more good restaurants.   Anyway, if you go, I recommend the classic burger and fries. Skip the salad. Still is overpriced."}
{"text":"Food delicious, service excellent.  (Best ambiance is outside, so we don't go when it's too hot for that). Focus is on healthy fare, but it also has a discreet wine/beer bar in a separate area for those who wish to include that in the experience. I love having a place within walking distance!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Modern Grove.  We are so glad to have another great place to eat in Mesa. We had the Rise and Shine and Ultimate Breakfast sandwich. Both were good choices not anything fancy but tasted good.  We are excited to come back and try their other lunch and dinner items."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bianca pizza and strawberry chicken salad. The food was pretty good, but just expensive for what it was. It was pretty slow for the night. I feel compelled to leave a 20% tip at the counter but wait staff basically just dropped our food off and asked how everything was. If you give a 20% tip, I feel like staff should walk over and ask if you need a take out box and clean your plates.  Overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"While the food here is usually good the service is awful! I've come here a few times and it's been bad every time. This will be my last visit here. There is a total of 7 people here and it has taken over 30 minutes to get our breakfast paninis. This will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Tried this after finding it on yelp. Did not know it was the there.  Good food we tried the bruscetta and the pizza with ham, carmelized onion.and goat cheese."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter for dinner. Food was decent. Got a burger protein style. Ordered clam chowder and got potato soup - at least there didn't appear to be any clams in it, but it was still tasty. Daughter had a panini. Overall good experience, even though I have read pretty bad reviews."}
{"text":"My friend and I met for lunch on a Friday, and the place was busy but not overly crowded. We both ordered salads, and they were delicious. It was hard to choose because everything on the menu looked great. The only downside: there is major construction around the restaurant so accessing it was a bit of a pain. I can't wait for the city to finish up the roadwork since I'd love to come back and try other items!"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast at Modern Grove this morning and it was delicious.  We both had the ultimate breakfast sandwich and a latte.  The service was friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was just as refreshing.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood has been dying for fresh good open modern food, wine, and friendliness! Modern Grove provides it! Hands down yummy goodness! Misty and Erik the bartender's rock-it and is are structural gears; pizza oven needs some work on completeness of dough cookness, great prices, clean, open, expect complaints from the LDS community cuz its in it and its not Mexican, this place is a sneak peek at what \"Mesa Should Have!\""}
{"text":"Turkey burger. Because it's November and stuff. But holy salt batman.... I think the chef accidentally poured the whole can of salt on this burger. I'm just too lazy to walk back in from the patio to tell them. Plus the cashier was nice enough to bring my dog a bowl of water, so I don't want to come off as an ungrateful jerk.   Like the patio ambience though, and dog friendly makes up for the salt fest. Sort of.   They have a bar. Looks like a nice selection of craft beers and wine. Order at the counter, seat yourself. I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"Not very crowded for a weeknight but still decided to give this place a try. The banner in front says \"Under New Management\". Upon entering we were greeted and told we could sit anywhere. server took our drink orders and brought those back and took our order. Food came out quickly and the strawberry salad and Reuben sandwich were well portioned and very tasty. Our server checked on us a couple of times to see if we were doing ok. Location might not be the best, but I hope they succeed. We would go back again if we are ever in the area. Great service and food and a nice place to dine out."}
{"text":"I love this place it they changed the menu! bring back the fig jam pizza it was to die for. one of my favorites and they no longer have it! use to come once a week just for it!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but a little pricey.  Burgers are $11, at that price I would expect more then a patty.  Because the cow was not given hormones, as menu states, doesn't mean a frozen patty made from its meat is going to be any better.  The side portion of pasta salad was ridiculously small."}
{"text":"Diverse menu. Posh deli feel. Serves alcohol. Prices are a little high for the location and would be even for Scottsdale. Overall great outdoor patio and excellent service."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I felt like it was priced pretty high for basically fast food. You order at a counter then wait and pick up your food when called. For $11 a sandwich I would have liked to be waited on."}
{"text":"This is the classic mistake most restaurants make - they value style above substance.  Though it is a beautiful sandwich shop, the food is mediocre. We were served by beautiful food by beautiful teenagers that had little flavor. I had a dry, tasteless chicken panini that cost me almost 10 bucks. (That's another gripe of mine- why the heck does a sandwich with a fancy name have to cost 10 dollars...its a frickin sandwich people!)  You could serve me dinner on a paper plate with greasy napkins and I would be happy, provided it actually tasted good.  That is why I go out to eat....to eat good food, not tasteless, stylized drivel.  Make the food taste as good as it looks...otherwise....what's the point?"}
{"text":"Had lunch today and unfortunately I was very disappointed. I had the pizza and the crust was so soggy I couldn't even pick it up. My son had the chicken salad sandwich which had big chunks of dry, tasteless chicken. Our other two meals (there were four of us) were just ok. The bill was $55 which is quite high for the area and way too high for the poor quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! A bit pricey but well worth it. It is under new management and he is very nice! Makes sure you're comfortable and have everything you need. My favorite part is they are dog friendly and will bring out a bowl of water and a dog treat! I would recommend to give this place a try"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, and have eaten at Modern Grove though each stage of their existence.  my mom was in town visiting, we chose MG. Wednesday night 5:30.  they looked under staffed.  the waitress was very nice,  and the food was good.  The price was high.  4 burgers, 1 plate of fries, 2 sodas, 4 beers, and a cup of tea $98.00.  I thought I was a chase field.  $8.50 for a 20 oz beer.  I would love to continue to support this local place but not for the prices that they charge."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the $5 birthday burger. The food was fine. I customized my burger (and paid extra to do so) and they messed it up several times. FYI, I didn't send it back; the waitress came to the table multiple times and was like, \"Sorry, the cook accidentally did _____, so he had to remake the burger.\" Needless to say, the wait was forever. Finally, the burger made it out, still wrong, but I just wanted to eat. The fruit cup was tiny and the burger, while good, wasn't super filling.   If I ever go back, I'll try one of the salads."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Mesa after living in Arcadia for 3 years. I was so excited to have a cute new restaurant in my neighborhood, seeing as mesa doesn't have a ton of restaurants and Arcadia is full of them! I have Modern Grove 3 solid tries because I really wanted to like them! I talked to our waiter each time to give them feedback because I just really wanted them to survive. After time number 3, I'm kind of over it. The food is good, but not good enough for the price! The prices are more expensive than LGO and the food, service and atmosphere isn't even comparable. It's such a cute spot and, like I said, the food is good. Just crappy service, waiters/cashiers who seem scattered and not super educated on the menu, and too pricy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood hangout! Great food, great craft beers. Service is good. Mostly self serve; order your own food and pick up your own drinks at the bar.  They are recently trying a happy hour but days and times were vague (not printed on the happy hour menu) and because of this we missed it by 10 min. We were not offer an extention.  Few kinks to work out like every new restaurant.   We will be back.  Hopefully more often if the happy hour is set in stone."}
