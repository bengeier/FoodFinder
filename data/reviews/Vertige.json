{"text":"We had a fabulous meal at this restaurant a few days ago, and we will definitely be back!  Excellent service, and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Land Menu, and loved every bite.  And I don't consider myself a connoisseur of meat, either; I usually order fish when I go out to eat.  But all of the items on the Land Menu were superb.  I cannot wait to go back and sample some of the other dishes.  Now we understand why this restaurant is so popular!"}
{"text":"Everything was great, but what stood out was the excellent seared foie gras!"}
{"text":"We went to this great little spot for my daughter's 20th birthday.   We were not disappointed. I had the fois gras to start which was excellent. Not the best I ever had but it ranks up there. I followed with the sweetbreads. For those not familiar this is thyroid (of calf, in this case). I have had this several times over the years as it is a French specialty. Here it was delicious. A rich creamy sauce but not overly heavy.   I forget what everybody else had but suffice to day opinions were much the same as mine.   I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation. I will go back."}
{"text":"We went to Vertige for New Year's Eve and did their New Year's Eve tasting menu which consisted of the following: (excuse my rough English translations-this is what I understood the dishes to be generally)  -Amuse Bouche  (Oyster Tartare with caviar)  -VELOUTÉ DE CÈPES FAÇON CAPPUCCINO-Arancini de risotto aux cèpes (Cream of Mushroom Soup with foam and Fried Black Truffle Risotto Balls)   -VERRINE DE PÉTONCLE ET CAVIAR DE MULET-Émulsion de chardonnay au citron (Sea Scallop Mousse with Caviar)   -LE FOIE GRAS DE CANARD AU TORCHON MAISON-Chutney de figues séchées confites au porto, pain brioché grillé  (Foie Gras with Fig Chutney and Brioche Toast)  -LE PAVÉ DE BAR DU CHILI RÔTI-En croûte de chorizo et d'oignons confits, brandade croustillante Jus de viande réduit au porto (Chilean Sea Bass with Mashed Potatoes two ways- fried and regular)   -LES JOUES DE VEAU DE LAIT BRAISÉES- Sauce Madère à la truffe, mousseline de céleri-rave Fricassée de champignons et haricots verts  (Veal Cheeks with Mashed Potatoes)   -LE FONDANT AU CHOCOLAT-Glace au caramel à la fleur de sel, tuile de cacao  (Chocolate Lava Cake with Salted Caramel Ice Cream)  I love seafood but the oyster and the sea scallop mousse were a little overly fishy for me.  Both were presentations of the seafood that I've never had before though so it was still pretty fun to try.  The mushroom soup and the fried black truffle risotto balls were amazing.  The soup warmed me up and the flavor of the soup and the risotto balls were perfectly seasoned. If you like mushrooms and risotto at all, you will love this dish.  The foie gras was good but not spectacular. It was a generous portion though and 4 slices of brioche toast was provided.  I really enjoyed the Chilean sea bass and the veal cheeks.  The sea bass had a great firm texture and the veal cheeks were very tender.  I thought there was a little too much mashed potatoes going on, even though it was done well.  As for dessert, I absolutely loved the chocolate lava cake and salted caramel ice cream.  The lava cake comes in a very hot cup so be careful not to burn yourself.  This was my favorite part of the meal and I was scraping out all the chocolate by the end, even though I had been overly full 2 courses earlier.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and it was bang for your buck at 5 courses + amuse bouche for $59 and $10 more if you got the foie gras.  I think I just expected a bit more for one of the top French restaurants listed on Trip Advisor, and for French food in Montreal.  P.S. I believe that many of these dishes are on their regular menu as well, so find which ones interest you and check to see if they're on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great incentive tapas place! If you have a substantial appetite the Tuesday through Thursday $29 per person tasting menu is a good deal."}
{"text":"We went to Vertige last night for a late dinner, and were very pleased with the experience. Vertige is a casual but upscale place with a funky music playlist and convivial atmosphere. Our waitress cheerily greeted us in French but graciously switched to English when we asked. She was very attentive throughout the meal and always made sure our wine glasses were full. The Coq Au Vin was simply the best chicken I have ever had anywhere. It was full of flavor and fell off the bone. We also had the fois gras duo and steak tartare, which were divine. All highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to Vertige after not being able to reserve a spot at Au Pied de Cochon. We arrived at 6 pm and there was not a single soul in there whereas it was packed at Au Pied de Cochon. Should have known.  We came here for seared foie gras based on recommendations from other Yelpers.  We've eaten foie gras in many places, and this is by far the worst!!!  It was over cooked and dry.  Also, I don't know where exactly they got their foie gras but it was stringy and disgusting.  Foie gras is supposed to melt in your mouth, but I just couldn't swallow it.  Very rare for me to turn down foie gras, but this is the first time I allowed my husband to eat it himself.  We also ordered filet mignon and it was dry.  Too bad because the waitress Isabelle was very sweet.  Our meal ended up costing $180, after all the taxes.  You're welcome, Canada!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! They wouldn't let me and my wife drink at this empty restaurant at the bar. We were told we could only stay at the bar if we ate. I understand this if the restaurant was full or if they were going to become full, but this place was the empty. No joke, it was 15 percent full at tops and stayed that way all night (we ended up eating next door at the magnificent Au Pied De Cochon). The server was super rude as well. ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"This is the Montreal we were looking for: modern, eclectic cuisine with a French accent.  You can get Indian, Italian, Portuguese, etc. in any city. This wasn't stuffy French, but it was excellent from the bread to the wine to the duck confit to the molten chocolate cake.   Plus the service and atmosphere were pleasant and enjoyable.  And it's located in a lovely neighborhood, good for walking or biking."}
{"text":"I like this place because they were very understanding that I didn't speak French. I came here on a Friday night but got a table immediately. I got the Escargot (snails), Magret Canard (duck), Plat Petoncles (scallops), Merlot wine, and Tourte Mi-Cuite (chocolate cake).  All were excellent but my favorite was the Magret Canard."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  Other reviews must have been written in the twilight zone.  Lackluster wine list over cooked veal rubber gnocchi best part of the dinner was the cab ride home.  How do you say garbage in French?   Vertige"}
{"text":"Malgre la reputation et la recommendation pr ce resto, je suis surprisement decue de l'accueil et de l'attitude des hotesses/serveuses.  On ns a carrement mal-accueilli et repondu froidement.  Concernant le menu affiche a l'entree, ca faisait deja 3 semaines qu'il l'avait plus sur la carte de menu - fausse publicite pr faire rentrer les clients ds l'etablissement.  En plus d'avoir une serveuse effrontee et mal-polie. Je recommande personne a y aller a ce resto sur la rue Duluth. Tant pis pr eux, ils ont perdu une clientele-gastronome!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my aunt's birthday. We were a large group, and so a group menu was offered, and I was surprised by the wide selection they had. The service was good and accommodated us well.   For my part, I had foie gras, salmon and beef tartar and a fondant au chocolat for dessert. Across the table, many other dishes were taken: beef carpaccio, steak, ossobuco, etc. Some of the entrées served looked stunning, such as the cromesquis de porc fondant.  The portions were big, take for example their ossobuco. The place is nice, good ambiance, but I wasn't impressed with the taste. Foie gras left me hanging and the tartar was ok. For dessert, I had a chocolate fondant, which I found ok. The crème brulée my sister took however was probably the biggest one I've ever seen, and it is serve in a long rectangular tray, which stands out from the usual circular form.  Overall, ambiance is nice, food is ok but with big portions. If you're looking for a place to catch up with friends, Vertige is good. However, if you're expecting the culinary experience of your life, this place doesn't crack the top in my opinion. There are better French places according to taste.  Finally, I guess the price is a bit pricey (65$ for table d'hôte entrée/fois gras/main/dessert and a martini), but I had a great time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely perfect! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday our first night visiting Montreal. They were fully booked with reservations but set us up at the bar to accommodate us (extremely nice).   We started off with them handing us a sample of the Lobster Bisque (which was delicious) and fresh bread and butter. We then ordered the Steak Tartar, Mesclun salad and Truffle risotto balls. All were great, but the tartar and risotto balls were my favorite.   The entrees were the Roasted Cod and Moroccan Lamb Shank. The cod was so buttery and perfect; the lamb fell right off the bone. We practically licked the plates clean.   Finally, we had the Panna Cotta for dessert, which was served in a cute mason jar with fresh berry compote. It was a perfect finish to the meal.   The waitress was attentive and so sweet, and the chef was so nice - he kept peeking out to ask us if we liked it. It was an overall great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at Vertige. The host welcomed us warmly and provided guidence in our menu selections. My friend and I each had 3 courses plus dessert. Everything was tasty and well-prepared."}
{"text":"Delightful attentive staff. We had the duck and \"land\" menus. Flavorful new cuisine. Pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was orgasmic!!! We ordered the discovery menu for seafood, the duo foie gras, shrimp, and Portuguese chicken. I had some doubt with the chicken but it was super tender like I have never tasted chicken before! The veggie in the chicken probably has been dabbed in wine sauce. Super delicious. The morue was so soft I don't need any knifes to cut it. Sorry for the rambling but that was how good the food was! Even the fries that accompanies the chicken was surprisingly addictive! The bread they used for the foie gras was the pain brioche and that with the figue was just a perfect balance. The shrimp ravioli of which I thought would be just meh turned out to melt in your mouth! Don't forget the martini as well!   It was my first time here. I have heard some good things about the place but for some reason the French restaurants in old ports looked more attractive on yelp than this place so I haven't been to this one until now!   The servers were super nice and I would totally recommend people to come here. Especially if you are here for tourism that's the most INEXPENSIVE and EPIC French restaurant you can find in Montreal! Trust me, I've been trying to find the best one at any cost!   I don't usually write reviews but I just had to create an account and tell people about this because the rating was not high enough for what it's worth! Try it for yourself :)"}
{"text":"We're getting to be regulars at this terrific little restaurant. the food is excellent and the value extraordinary!   Most recently we celebrated New Years at Vertige with a group of about 15 friends. They setup the tables in the rear of the restaurant in a large rectangle for us so we all sat together at one large table and it felt like we had our own private restaurant. We had a great prix fixe menu where the food seemed to never stop flowing and all for about $85, did I mention that it was New Years Eve!  I also highly recommend their Tuesday and Wednesday night tapas. You can select 6 items from the menu for a fixed price of $29/person. The rest of the week they also offer great multi-service menu options all at extremely reasonable prices.   Great food & great atmosphere a definite must in my book!"}
{"text":"I've been to Vertige 3 times over the last 1.5 years and have loved the food every time. The prices are good and the service is very attentive. The first time, we came for tartarefest in 2016; I had the salmon tartare and Alex had the beef tartare - both were very good. We also ended up ordering mains; I got a pasta dish and Alex got a meat dish - both were very good.   The second time we came for lobster mania or something in the summer of 2016, where we got two small portions of lobster risotto which was amazing. Again, we ended up ordering mains; I got a pasta dish and Alex got a meat dish - and both were very good.   The latest time we've been here was August 2017, as I won their Instagram contest of a 6 course meal. Although I did not LOVE everything, it wasn't because the food wasn't good, its just because certain things I didn't like much (like the foie gras, that's not my cup of tea). I really enjoyed the grilled shirmp risotto, the cod fish, the duck and the salmon tartare. We also ordered drinks which were excellent (amaretto sour and kir fragoli).   For my full review (en français) and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"I just went there for my dad's birthday. He's not so fond of \"wierd foods\" as he would probably say it.   We actually tried the Tuesday and Wednesday special (6 tapas for 23$) and HE LOVED IT! We had some arranchini (exquisitly moist and flavourful), the lobster raviolli (to die for), the steak was well cooked, but a bit too salty to my taste, the coconut shrimps were well balanced, the portuguese chicken was tender and well seasoned, some foie gras en chiffonnade (great texture)...  I don't remember all we got, since the special requires everyone at the table to take the special if you want it, so we had 18 plates total (with some we took 2 or 3 of)...  2nd time around for me and I'll definitely come back there again."}
{"text":"The food was great! The decor is very modern, it has a bistro/bar/classy restaurant vibe and it all works very well.   We decided to go with a small group of people, 7-8, on a Tuesday and we we're strongly recommend to go with the Tuesday special since you get to taste a lots of food for the price if one regular dish.   This is we're they lost a star in my opinion... The way it worked is: we have one sheet of paper and you put down the number if tapas you wanna a get for the entire group. So your order is for 7-8 and not only for yourself, my suggestion: write down your choices because the waitress won't bother ( she told us she wouldn't ). So we did order about 40 plates since it's 6 per person, and what was to supposed to happen did. The order messed up. We had one tapas extra and one of us had 2 tapas missing. The waitress blamed it on us and told us we had to pay for the extra... Overall the food was great and she bitterly gave is the two missing plate and brought back the extra taps to the kitchen. One order per patron would have saved her the trouble, but some people don't listen.   I still recommend, great food, good ambiance and on a Tuesday, if you \"like\" the place on Facebook, you have a complimentary drink!"}
{"text":"It was OK - for the prices and the what the menu was said to offer, I expected better. We were told right off the bat that the main courses were small, so they suggested you order 2 per person......... that threw me off right away because main courses already were priced around the $20 mark. Yes, they have a tasting menu, but when you're not a pasta eater, or too keen of red meat, you prefer to make your own choices. They gave us bread to start, which at least was warm, but was basically a baguette. My husband had to request olive oil because the butter tasted like nothing, really.   So between the 2 of us, we started with the Bison Kofta... basically 3 meatballs on a chickpea puree. Absolutely nothing special and made me nervous for the meal to come. I hate when you go to a new restaurant and read good reviews and then the meal starts off on the mediocre/bad side of things. Then we had the foie gras, which was 2 small round pieces of cold foie gras, 2 toasts, and a teaspoon of fig marmalade. This was the first time I didn't really enjoy foie gras... it's supposed to be a treat. But served cold and looking like liver pate, we were a little disappointed. Especially with how small the portion was. Cannot believe this was in the main meal portion of the menu. Do not order this as your main, you will leave starving. The fig marmalade was good though, it went nicely with the foie gras. But again, would've preferred it warm or pan fried.  Then we had the sweetbreads and duck magret. The duck... mehh.. again, I've had better and so have you most likely. The sweetbreads were delicious though - I'm a big fan of sweetbreads so it's difficult to do this wrong. Both were served atop of a portion of creamy parmesan polenta which was probably the tastiest part of the meal. But again, the portions were small to OK. Again, at a restaurant like this, you either expect to be blown away with the taste, or leave completely satisfied. There was nothing innovative about their meal, no flavor combinations you haven't tried before. Vertige is not a dinner destination I will go for again - in Montreal, you can find a better spot for a $100 dinner."}
{"text":"Mediocre. It's what you expect from elegant  French cuisine but the flavored either didn't go well together or was just not memorable.  It's fine if you're hungry and like spending money on food... But not if you're looking for a unique or exquisite dining experience.  We ordered: Mushroom tartalette Escargot Salmon tartar Duck brick (it was an eggroll) Duck with polenta Black truffle Arancini Foie gras Chocolate soufflé  The best thing from this was the roasted duck with polenta. I felt they did it right. Everything else was good, don't get me wrong. Just easily forgettable."}
{"text":"We walked in at 10 til 10pm, starving and desperately wanting French food for our first night in Montreal.  They told us they could take us if we ordered quickly-- I was afraid that the whole meal would be rushed but they ended up telling us to take our time.  They brought out a free tapas plate- sort of a seasoned meatball on top of a chickpea spread-- it was good and helped to tide us over.  For hour devoures we got Crispy Shrimp which had a tasty dipping sauce.  For dinner, I had the pan seared scallops over greens and a cauliflower puree.  The scallops were perfectly cooked-- I was afraid they might be rubbery.  The puree was seasoned very well.    We skipped the dessert and instead had a round of beers.    It was an excellent meal and the waitstaff took care of us well."}
{"text":"(je voudrais mettre 3.5 comme note mais c'est juste 3 ou 4, alors je mets 3) Nous y sommes allées entre copines pour le Tartarefest. Le tartare de saumon était délicieux, le verre de vin qui venait avec aussi. Nous avons aussi pris des à coté, qui étaient tous très bons. Le service était impeccable aussi. Seul petit hic, je dirais les prix, mais je pense que ce sont les prix sur Duluth?! En tout cas, les verres de vin sont à 10$, et les plats entre 14 et 19$ sans accompagnement pour certains, qui sont entre 4 et 6$ chaque. Ceci dit, c'est un bon rapport qualité prix je pense, et il y avait beaucoup de monde le soir où on y était (un mercredi), c'est que tout doit être très bon! :)"}
{"text":"After getting our fix on poutine and crepes, we decided to have a nice dinner out and we found this place. We wanted French food, since Montreal is French influenced. For starters we had the Foi Gras (seared and in pate form), and Escargo. Both dishes were finely decorated and tasted as good as it looked. The chef even brought out fried cod for us to sample, in some type of orange tartar sauce. For an entree I ordered the cheek meat, which came on a bed of mash potatoes, corn, carrots, and string beans, all covered in a gravy sauce. The meat itself was very tender and flavorful. Although the food was good, service and food was very slow (maybe it's because we're spoiled Americans and we want to get in and get out..  Decor was dark and really set the mood except for me finding floaters in my water.  Anyways if you're in the area and feeling for some French this place is not too shabby."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. My boyfriend and I were in town and someone recommended this place to us. We went on a Thursday evening, so we were able to take advantage of their 6 tapas for $29... such a great deal.   Food: The tapas really exceeded my expectations. They all had such great flavor and the meat was so tender. Of course, they were very small, but I definitely felt full by the end. The escargo was out of this world! I also loved the chicken.   Ambience: The place is cute enough. It's clean and has a good date night vibe. They were playing a really great playlist the night we were there, so we really enjoyed it.   Service: I think there was only one waitress working the entire dining room. When we got there, we were the only ones in there, so it was fine, but as more people started showing up, it became a bit slow. It took a while to get our check. But we were so pleased by the food and music that we didn't even really care."}
{"text":"What can I say about Vertige that hasn't already been said?  We came here on the last night of our trip to have some authentic French cuisine.  The atmosphere was romantic in that we were dining in a dimly-lit room with relaxing, ambient music, but I also saw groups having dinner (double-dates, birthday parties, etc.).  The dress code was fairly casual.  We ordered a bottle of wine, Les Deux Anges, which was absolutely perfect and our accommodating waitress would not let our glasses be empty for a second.  We began our meal with an amuse-bouche of salmon tartare which was delicious, as was the bread that accompanied it.  I had scallops with grilled vegetables for my main course.  Excellent.  I also had a bite of Mike's duck which I can attest to being \"un-FUC-ing believable.\"  While Montreal really is a great city for dining (as well as shopping, as I found), Vertige was easily the best restaurant we tried, in my opinion, and I would urge anyone visiting MTL to go there."}
{"text":"I came here twice, once in 2008 and again two weeks ago. The first time I went,  I had a 6 course meal and it was amazinggg. But the second time I came I had the group menu which wasn't as impressive. The group menu consisted of 4 services for 39$. I started off with the tomato soup (with milk foam), it was on the sour end.  I then had the salmon tartare, which wasn't as flavorful and came off a bit bland. For my main, I had a filet mignon . I asked for it bloody, but it came to me medium rare. (I think I wasn't clear enough, I should have said \"blue rare\" that's the correct term for an extremely rare steak). For my dessert I had a chocolate tourte.   Service was very pleasant, but food was a bit overpriced and some dishes was a hit or miss. I wouldn't really go back again."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal for New Years and was looking for a restaurant for NYE. We had a few recommendations but each place was booked. Although the Yelp review were mixed, we decided to give this place a try.   I was extremely happy with the experience and food. The menu was a five course set menu. The lobster ravioli was great, next came the arctic char which was delicious and cooked to perfection, we ordered cod instead of the beef dish which was also great. We selected a Merlot which was very reasonably priced. The service was great and the atmosphere was great as well. Our server said the cod is one of the most popular dishes and I can recommend that.  Overall, great new years experience!"}
{"text":"Very good ambiance. We sat by the large window in the front of the restaurant in a warm evening. I started with the foie gras, which was divine. As foie gras lovers, my boyfriend and I agreed that this place has one of the best foie gras that we ever had! They served it with a glass of wine that goes with it. I had a dish with fish with vegetables as my entree that was delicious too. The service was very good and the waitress was knowledgeable.."}
{"text":"upscale-casual atmosphere, perfect portions of delicious French and French-influenced food, an extensive list of wines, and actually fairly affordable...I really think Vertige is a perfect storm of French dining in Montreal.  located on a short but busy side street in an otherwise fairly quiet and residential neighborhood, Vertige was our final dinner in Montreal and really cemented how awesome this city is for dining. candle-lit tables, some chill/jazz music, and an awesomely designed bar (lots of lights/lamps).  we were given a small sample of salmon tartare and bruschetta to start off with, as well as some excellent bread. having not eaten since lunch (it was now around 8:30), this was certainly good padding for the wine and stemmed me from going T. Rex on my dinner.  when I saw multiple menu choices with duck, it was clearly time to go \"positively decadent\". I wound up getting the roasted duck magret. it was like a steak...but made from duck, with a maple and port wine reduction on top, and a bed of string beans and puree sweet potatoes underneath. un-F.U.C.-ing-believable! so many flavors working together in wonderful unison.  as for booze...their focus is on a huge list of red and white wine from all over the world. I'm not really a wine drinking guy (I'm a terrible Italian-American in this respect; I am more of a beer/whiskey/gin type) but it seemed fitting to class it up with a bottle of vino. ended up picking Les Deux Anges, a terrific French red.  service was excellent. not pushy and hovering, but not forgetful and lazy. perfect.  there's no real single \"type\" of clientele here, demographics-wise. it's fine for groups or couples, families or friends, young or old. while some were more dressed up than others, no one was in a suit or anything too stuffy like that.  the portions are perfect for the price. you won't waddle out all bloated, but you won't feel ripped off (the latter is my chief complaint with French food in New York).  I would most certainly go back to Vertige again. the fact that they also have a tapas menu on some nights and a full multiple-course tasting menu means the combinations for deliciousness are endless."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner last night.  The food was very well executed.  The service was incredibly discreet leaving plenty of room for leisurely conversation.   The whole evening was very well paced.  The  table d'hote option is very nice ($10).  Nice selection of wines.  Though they have English menus, you may want to research the menu on-line before hand because the French descriptions are better.  Not to worry though, you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"They have one of the best Foie Gras I have ever had (prepared on site)(Should be accompanied by a glass of Sauternes; strongly recommended). The atmosphere is usually pleasant,  in a cozy decor that will make you feel at ease within seconds. I have been there twice, and I really enjoyed the food and overall experience both times. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"In the cute Duluth street, i'm not sure that vertige really specializes in a specific style. The food is strongly classic but well done. Obviously, I noted the very cool wine cork tables, covered with corks of nice producers from around the world with a strong portuguese majority, at least for the one table I was seated at. The wine list is very interesting too! And extremely affordable. All the wines are between let's say 20 and 55$ with a great overall quality for the price. This is a huge advantage. If you go on a warm sunny day, the huge sliding windows might be open for you to enjoy fresh air."}
{"text":"We loved our evening at Vertige. We had the 7 course tasting menu and every course was delicious. Service was fantastic! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for the holidays and I literally spent 2 hours trying to find a good restaurant and I gave up and let my husband pick. He picked Vertige and it was beyond awesome. We were there on a Tuesday night and got to sample 6 \"tapas\" or choice of small bites of appetizers or main courses for only $29. All were fantastic, as was the wine and the service even though there was only one server on duty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Family occasion, table for 10. Set menu (busy F1 weekend) was superb. Lots of choice.  Service Service was excellent. Great wine list. Just what you want in a local Brasserie in a pleasant street   Room Classic modern Brasserie: busy but not too noisy. Starch white table cloths.  Food Tomato Soup, Salmon Tartare, Bavette de Veau, Chocolate Brut. Classics done well. Only complaint was that fries tasted a bit of old grease and were not crispy.  I would go back. 4 and a half stars. Great evening!"}
{"text":"We went to Vertige for their Tapas night which takes place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. All I have to say was that it worth every penny! Tapas night at Vertige works on a set menu kind of like a table d'hôte, you pick 6 different tapas from the list and share with your friends, your friends also pick 6 from the list. We were 12 so we got to taste every tapas on the menu and every one of them were excellent.   The service was stellar even with a large group all the food came to the table at the same time no one was ever without something to eat or drink. The ambiance was cozy and warm even if the restaurant was less then filled to capacity since it was a Tuesday night but that didn't matter the place still felt lively and fun, the fact that we were twelve may have played a part in the atmosphere.   All and all this was a great experience and I will be back! If the tapas are any indication of the quality you can expect from the rest of the menu I can't wait to go back on a weekend! Try you'll love it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday while on Vacation in Montreal. We chose 12 tapas from their Tuesday/Wednesday tapas menu and were very pleased. The choices were great and we were able to try many different foods. We had a few beef, duck, cheese, and chicken tapas, as well as a delicious mango salad which had little mango slices on top that tasted like candy.  Highly recommend coming here and trying as much out as you can!"}
{"text":"Tour guide recommended this restaurant and thought since I liked his lunch recommendation, I'd listen to his dinner suggestion.  I'd give this gem of a restaurant 4.5 stars if that was an option.  Wonderful appetizer for me and hubby - shrimp ravioli and the foie gras duo, veal chop was the best I've had - perfectly cooked. Great wine and service.  All around wonderful experience.  Nice neighborhood - welt like SoHo in NYC. Will come again next visit for sure."}
{"text":"Tapas have expanded to Thursday night too!  Enjoyed the small plates and had a delightful array of items from lamb to beef tar tar, and shrimp!  A wonder sampler of food for $29."}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience at Vertige. Our dining experience started out okay with appetizers that were tasty, and then it just went downhill. I ordered the steak- was not what I expected at all. The piece of meat was massive but overcooked and it came with creepy vegetables that looked like frozen ones. I ordered the crème brulée for dessert, which tasted more like burnt milk than anything else.   The server was rude and condescending, and we were basically kicked out of the restaurant at 10:30ish because the servers had their friends at the bar and wanted to drink with them. And instead of asking us to leave politely, they just decided to blast music (some weird disco stuff) and ignore us when all we wanted was to get the bill and get the hell out of there. I will not be going back to Vertige, Montreal has a lot better to offer."}
{"text":"They do tapas nights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We had dinner reservations but tapas seemed like a fun thing to try, so we did. Seems like a small staff, it almost seemed like a family-run restaurant, which is pretty nice. The decor seemed interesting, somewhere between a bar and a trendy restaurant.  Overall, though, it seemed like it was more concerned with attracting a gourmet audience (something about the purple lights and the tapas menu...) than actually just being really consistently good. All together we had 12(!) plates. That's a lot of different stuff. A couple were really great, a couple were really not great, and everything else was pretty much in the middle -- not bad, not amazing, and pretty much exactly what I'd expect from any restaurant.  Maybe if they concentrated on fewer dishes it could be great. The service is shockingly good - two servers for the whole place, I think, and we never really had to wait for anything - it's busy, it's got a great location. Maybe the non-tapas dinner is amazing, but it'll be a while before I go try again."}
{"text":"Everything looks delicious on the menu it was difficult to choose. I went with one of their discovery menus as did my daughter where they give you 4 courses with the intention of tasting one another's dishes.  She had the land menu, I selected the sea menu. Brilliant decision! We had beef carpaccio/salmon tartare, veal kofta/shrimp ravioli, lamb chop/cod, and for dessert, molten chocolate cake with caramel ice cream! My husband and other daughter both selected filet mignon- mouth watering tender and succulent! My biggest surprise was the shrimp ravioli. It is served with a coconut sauce, Or at least there was coconut in the sauce.  It doesn't matter.  It was divine!  Could have eaten that as my main entree! We were very impressed! There is a window to view the kitchen from the dining room. Looks like 2 chefs did it all!! The wait staff comprised of 3 women.  All very pleasant and attentive! We did not have a reservation, but they were able to accommodate us on a Friday night at 7pm! I'm so happy they did!"}

Had the duck confit brick, which kinda had an Asian flair, it looked similar to an egg roll and had sweet and sour sauce... but it definitely tasted much better than an egg roll. The beef carpaccio, which was very clean and fresh. For entrees we had the sea scallops which were perfectly cooked, and the Duo of Foies gras and Sweet breads which were deliciously rich and fatty!"}
{"text":"Resto bien décoré, ambiance intime et chaleureuse. C'est surprenant qu'il n'y avait pas plus de convives un samedi soir. Le service et les conseils accord vin avec les plats vraiment top! Les plats sont délicieux, prix et portion super! Compter 3 tapas par personne ou le menu dégustation si vous êtes deux affamés. Les arancinis sont à faire rêver. J'y reviens assurément avec l'être cher."}
