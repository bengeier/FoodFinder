{"text":"One day I complained to a girlfriend who is from Queens NY how much I miss NY pizza and she was the one that mentioned this place to me. But I ignored her wonderful comment \"this is the real NY pizza and it taste just like it\". The place is down the street from me, so I stopped by and when the smell of their pizza hit my nostrils I remembered her comment...she asked them if they were really from NY and she was told the entire family is from Long Island. After one bite of my one slice of pizza I was taken back to BK (Brooklyn). With closed eyes I had another bite and another and I found myself coming back for more. I am glad my friend told me about this place and I've taken other friends to experience the same excitement I have."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, I've been driving by on my way home from for a while now. Dinner was delicious my husband had the veal parmesan & I had the fra diavolo it was delicious, the portions are good sized you wont leave hungry. With your entree you get to pick the kind of pasta to have with it. In my Fra diavolo there was a lot of seafood. Dinner was fabulous. Have the cannoli it was amazing."}
{"text":"By far the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had! My daughter and I went there for Mother's Day. 1. Upon entering the restaurant, nobody was there to greet us. There were only about 5 tables sat at that time. It was 2:15pm, so before/after the rush. 2. Feeling awkward just standing there, I took a to-go menu from the plastic holder to look at. When the host finally came, I went to put it back and the plastic thing tipped over. I fixed it and the hostess said \"you o.k. there?\" HOW RUDE! 3. Server took way too long to come get our drink order. A table was sat behind us a few minutes after we were and had their drinks and order was being taken before we had our drinks. 4. The restaurant was NOT busy. The owner/manager or whoever she is just sat at the bar doing nothing but talking to the bartender who had 1 customer and was just chatting.  5. Ordered an appetizer. It took 20minutes. It was cheese sticks! 6. Finally got dinner ordered half an hour later. A philly steak sandwich and baked ziti. 7. Another 30minutes later, asked the server about our food. She said it should be a couple more minutes. 5 minutes later, no food. Asked her again and also asked why ours was taking so long and the table that sat behind us was now paying their bill! Server said \"I was wondering the same thing\". 8. Forty minute mark - food finally comes. Another server brought it. I asked her why our dinner took almost 40 minutes and this was her SNOTTY, RUDE reply....\"I checked the ticket, and your order was put in at 3:02pm. It is now 3:32pm, so that is only 20 minutes\". REALLY? That is 30 minutes lady. 9. Finally, so upset, I went up to the bar to find a manager. Turns out the woman doing nothing sitting at the bar was indeed the owner. I explained my frustration and she could care less. Her attitude was just as bad as the girl that delivered the food. Said \"we make all our food fresh here\", blah blah blah.  10. I asked for my check, we paid, and I left.   After getting home, I went to their website and found out the snotty waitress is also part of the family that owns this place. They claim to make you feel like part of the family when you come in. Nothing could be farther from the truth.   Thanks for making my Mother's Day so bad."}
{"text":"Was a big fan the first few times we ordered from LF. Great cook on the dough, just the right amount of not-too-sweet sauce, generous toppings, tasty sausage.  Then...we caught them without their lipstick and make-up...AAAAAAGGGHHH.  Burnt pizza, toppings uneven on the pie, wrong sauce given on request (pizza instead of marinara), sauces forgotten (Extra ranch? Sure, no prob- not gonna happen skippy). Oh, and don't forget the disconcerting delivery guy who says little and will not let go of the pie until you've signed and tipped, heh.   We keep trying to find great consistent pizza in this area and have struck out with 10 places so far- VERY, very disappointing.  These guys will do in a pinch, but don't hold your breath for Za nirvana. Seems it depends on who's taking your order, and if the big guy is not on premises stepping on the kitchen- it's a bad sign. Mamasita doesn't watch the kitchen or keep them on task, so you get mediocre at best.  The inconsistencies will slowly drive you insane, as it did us last night when we gave them yet one more try.  T"}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday for a 50th wedding anniversary party.The food and  service was great,especially the eggplant parm. They had a cannoli cake for desert hat was outstanding. Going back for their pizza."}
{"text":"Got the large calazone to go.  When I got home I noticed it wasn't  even fully cooked.  Yes the interiors were cooked, but the dough was raw. We had to throw out over half of it.  Waste of $20+.  Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"First time and will NOT be the last. Delivery was 20 minutes early. Food was fantastic. My husband loved the wings. Stromboli was perfect!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Excellent service they are very friendly. The wings are awesome too. Great local spot at a good price"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for a number of years.  I can describe it in one word--GREAT!  I'm from Long Island, New York and every time I visit this restaurant, I feel like I am home.  The aroma, friendliness and outstanding food keeps me coming back.  I live in Gold Canyon and drive many times to La Famiglia.  It's worth the trip!  Pizza is outstanding, pasta dishes are superb.  Check out the lunch menu.  Very extensive and real value at $5.95!"}
{"text":"Live this place, new fav family run spot! Pizza by the slice, great pasta selection, unique and delishous!"}
{"text":"Lisa I just want you to know that you have no idea what good pizza taste like...how could you say that there was no flavor in the pizza... there pizza is the most flavorful pizza you are going to taste in the UNITED STATES.....  you really don't know what you're talking about and I know because I was in the pizza business in Brooklyn New York and there basic cheese pizza in which they use  the best cheese you can use for pizza which is Grand cheese is the finest quality cheese you can use for a pizza.... the cheese spreads evenly and pizza is unbelievable.. The taste is unbelievable I'm pretty sure they throw some oregano on the pizza after it comes out of the oven you can taste it its really good..... Keep up the good work guys and I love your new location..."}
{"text":"Tonight I picked up a manicotti, side of meatballs and cannoli for my friend and I to share. It was all delicious! The manicotti had the perfect combination of cheeses, the meatballs were the perfect consistency and the cannoli was fresh and tasty. I would also recommend the white pizza with spinach, I've eaten it during past visits and it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Great moderately thin crust, good toppings and very flavorful. Wings are great and the garlic bread is a very generous 4 piece portion."}
{"text":"If you're longing for pizza like back home in New York this is the place for two reasons:  1 - Pizza tastes like it comes off 7th Avenue in Manhattan 2 - They're rude and act as though we're here to cater to and support them  I called in 20 minutes to closing tonight to order two pies for pick-up. She didn't even answer the phone with the business name and all she was interested in saying was that we had to be there by closing.  Thai Basil, Cornish Pasty, and other corporate chains in the area never do that.  The blonde portly girl gave flack all the way through the transaction.  My Spanish isn't the best but I swear their Spanish-only speaking cook in the back said something about a white guy and kept shaking his head in my direction during payment.  Luckily I watched the pies come out the oven, so I don't think they were sabotaged.  Except for an obtuse crust at the edge of the pizza, it tastes great!  Excellent sauce and decent cheese.  They'd get 4 to 5 stars if it weren't for the acerbic service.  So, if you want to be insulted and inconvenienced while you get a great tasting pizza, stop over at \"The Family\" and they'll treat you like their own step-child."}
{"text":"Sausage/Onion/Pepper Stromboli was really good and price-per-ounce a pretty good deal at ~$8.  The cheese was really stringy, and the sauce is a good compliment (worth the $0.75 charge...lol)."}
{"text":"I am so sad they moved since they are not as close anymore. This is an amazing family run business with a true Italian feel.   The food is absolutely fantastic with great prices to go along with it! Their garlic knots are amazing and I can't say enough about their Eggplant Parmesan. The Alfredo sauce tastes just as good re-heated the next day it did the day you ordered it, which is very hard to do. It is extremely creamy and wonderful.  Would highly recommend if you are looking for some great, authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"The waiter Steve is awesome, friendly and helpful. The pizza and pasta were perfect. Nice atmosphere. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pasta so I stopped by. Since this location was close to my house and I had heard they have good food I gave them a try.  I ordered a \"safe\" choice the spaghetti and meatballs. As I waited I saw some awards on the wall so I was hopeful. I was greatly disappointed! The dish had no flavor to it. I like big flavors in pasta dishes. This tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and warmed it up. Maybe their pizza is better, but I wont go back."}
{"text":"I come here most days on my lunch, as I work within walking distance. For about five dollars you get a large slice of delicious pizza and a drink. The complimentary wifi is icing on the cake. Friendly staff to boot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love their hand-tossed pizza! There's always plenty of cheese, great sauce, and lots of chewy, doughy crust. It definitely beats out any chain pizza we have had around here.  We always order our pie with sausage and mushrooms.  The sausage comes as large slices, as opposed to the ground, \"rolled up\" little pieces you sometimes find on pizza.  If you do order wings, know that the mild is very, very mild.  I often joke that even mild salsa burns my mouth, and yet I found these wings to be lacking any kick.  Definitely go for something higher on the heat scale if you want any spice.  Overall, I would stick to the pizza, but know that it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have had pizza from here before but never one of their dinners. All of that changed last night. The chicken parm alla nonna was delicious. The chicken and pasta were cooked perfectly, it had flavor and the sauce wasn't to chunky or to thin. Just right. A great meal."}
{"text":"Service from Isaac was fantastic! Owners sat and talked with us, which we enjoyed. Pasta Primavera was one of the best I've had, my hubby's Shrimp Scampi was incredible! Love this family owned/operated restaurant. Great food at reasonable prices. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"This place was not quite what I expected based on other reviews. I ordered the baked ravioli and garlic knots. The ravioli was not baked, they had good flavor but the sauce was bland marinara, from a baked pasta dish I would expect the melty cheese baked on top and maybe a little more flavor. These were nothing but your typical frozen, boiled then doused in sauce. They probably should take these off the \"Baked Pasta\" menu.   The garlic knots were great when they  were warm, as soon as they cooled off they were hard balls, almost as if they microwaved them before they were delivered. They did not come with any sauce, luckily my ravioli had more than enough. I'm not sure if this was a delivery mistake or that they just don't offer any dipping sauce.  I'd have to say that this would probably have been a 2 star review have the delivery drivers not been as prompt and personable as they were (yes, \"they\", there were two)."}
{"text":"I'm so happy these guys are right in my backyard.  We started going to their restaurant when they were up on Warner and Alma School; close, but now they are even closer and we couldn't be happier.  My wife and daughter had lunch there yesterday and whole family had dinner there tonight.  The wings and garlic knots are awesome.  My wife and I split the shells; very good.  You can even get pizza by the slice.  Excellent.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.  It's like being around the family kitchen table, only their family table.  Vinny (of course his name is Vinny :) ), our server, was great!  Attentive and took great care of us.  Be sure to sit in his section.  I know we'll be back and I can't wait.  Thanks La Famiglia!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in a 20km radius. Very different than your average pizza. The crust is very light and you don't feel like a whale after you eat it. Interesting and fresh toppings."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, the pizza got a little mediocre at one point, and I heard from an insider due to a family issue etc etc. they had let \"THE\" pizza guy go and had peeps with no skills creating the pie's, it showed. Glad to say it's better again, not sure what they did, but its been good. I'm a transplanted NY'er and know my pizza, and they do a rocking basic NY pie, the sicilian is great, for a little over $20 me and my wife get 4 meals out of that thing, a full large pizza box full of goodness! The calzones are also very good and salads are worth the money. The only current bad is the delivery, for a while I just didn't call them, always an 1.5 hour wait, that's just unacceptable. It's been better as of late and will continue to do business with them"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is a local family restaurant,  hard to get that here in AZ. The food is amazing. I have had the pizza, chicken parmesan, and desserts. They have all past my expectations. The service is good and fast for how fresh the food it. Great place to go."}
{"text":"When I first walked in this place had a horrible smell. The waitress finally came up after about a minute of standing then took me to sit down. At the table the seats and table were dirty I was wiping it off as I was scooting in to the booth. She just smiled and said sorry. Annoyed but i sat and looked at the menu. I ordered baked ziti. About 30 minutes later this plate gets brought out and there is runny sauce everywhere and hardly any noodles. First off baked ziti has everything baked into it....so the waitress comes back a few minutes later to check on me and asks what's wrong with the food and I asked her if that's how they do baked ziti because everywhere else I've ever gone has always baked it in. She tried to belittle what I just said by rewording it, then I told her that's what I just said to you. She grabs the food and takes it back. I paid then left. I will never go back to this place! Don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"The Fettucine Alfredo is heavenly.  It is so thick and creamy, and the noodles are so fresh.  The Stromboli is quite good.  I would give this place 5 stars if I were judging it by the food alone.  But the service is inconsistent, when I order for carryout, they get my order wrong half the time. Still, the Fettucine Alfredo is worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great neighborhood restaraunt. Pizza is OK. But their Fettuccini Alfredo is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, inexpensive, friendly service"}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place! We've been coming here for 8 yrs now. In fact, this was the place I sent my husband to many times during my pregnancy 7 yrs ago because it's so crave-inducing.  The girls who work there have enjoyed watching my son grow up and they know him by name :) I suggest the garlic knots and ziti. Every time we have a pool party or slumber party we order their pizza.  My favorite is the plain cheese...it's so good it doesn't need any toppings. This place is owned by a great NYC family who knows what they're doing!"}
{"text":"such amazing pizza! you have to try this place if you're in the area! I came here for a canadian pizza slice and it was the best i've had. However you're better off getting the xl pizza for $10 as opposed to one slice for $3.50. One slice for $3.50 (that u need two to feel full) vs. xl pizza to share with friends for $10 with about 8 slices"}
{"text":"This pizza place makes my list of top five pizza places in Arizona very good pizza. The Sicilian pizza is Very good as well."}
{"text":"I  my wife and I went to LA Famiglia  for Pasta night this past Monday.  The sign outside advertises  Monday as 7.99 pasta dishes. What it fails for show is any time frame email for this special. We ordered our pasta at 3:45  and we're served in about ten minutes. The check was printed at 4:20 but to my surprise the pasta dishes were charged at full price!, When I questioned the server she replied \"oh that doesn't start until 4 o'clock, you ordered a little earlier than that\". Neither sign in or out of the restaurant mentions any times for the special. I hope this trickery was profitable for them as they have lost me as a customer forever. As th ey say let the buyer beware."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because a friend of mine and held a birthday dinner here 2 years ago and I liked their pizza. I invited a couple of friends for my own birthday dinner this year.  At first I thought I would call to make sure if they had any tables available just to know if we had to wait or not. As restaurants almost always do, they asked if I could hold, so I said yes. After 5 whole minutes of staying on hold I got pretty irritated so I hung up and called again. Same guy answered and put me on hold again, and after 2min he picked up. Luckily, he said there was space available.  When I entered the restaurant, I wasn't even greeted by the hostess, no smile, no warm hello, no \"how many are in your party\", nothing. Just an emotionless look.  I had to ask her if she had a table and she directed us to it.  After everyone was seated, we ordered. The food was amazing. I ordered an 18in with veggies; huge portions and friends loved it. The Greek Salad was delicious. The La Famiglia Quattro was very good. I was never given any bread and olive oil, I remember specifically having it at my friends party. I came there to eat well, talk, laugh, have a good time, and spend money. I was gonna go all out for my birthday dinner. So I was quite upset when after about 20 min of eating, our server handed me the check right away, without asking if I was ready for it. Not once did she ask if the food tasted well, if we needed refills, or if she could get us anything else. After bringing the bill the first time, I handed it back and asked if I could order a small cheese to go. She brought it back along with the bill. I then sent it back and asked if we could order dessert, since she never bothered to ask. Finally we were all set, and I paid. Plain cheesecake was awesome, however a little small. We stayed a bit afterward just to settle down and let the food digest.   One thing I never understood is why I was put on hold for 5 minutes when throughout the whole night, there were maybe 4 tables filled, and there were 2-3 staff members just sitting down talking. They were not busy at all, and there was always someone available to pick up my call and answer a quick question. Secondly, I have never felt so rushed at a restaurant before. I don't know if our waitress thought we weren't serious about dining here and just came for a side salad or whatever. It disgraceful. I highly suggest training some of your servers, including ours, a Miss J.K. I felt very unwelcomed. I tried to be as nice as possible there, but I thought I would let others know what to expect. Not planning on returning here."}
{"text":"Running errands and spotted this little place.  Smelled wonderful inside so I bought two slices of cheese pizza and took a seat.  Service was nothing to write home about but Damm that pizza was good!!    Tasted like Manhattan Street pizza."}
{"text":"I get thus delivered often. Usually got a dish that has a nice Alfredo sause last time I ordered though it seemed ...different. Less creamy. Still tastey but I was a bit disappointing cause it was not the usual sauce."}
{"text":"Good food, normally pretty good service. I have been to this location five times and have not been overly disappointed with anything. I am  also not craving anything there on a regular basis either very clean environment and great desserts."}
{"text":"I've ordered from these guys about four times now. I've not ordered from any other pizza place since my first La Famiglia pizza. Does that tell you something! This is my pizza place now. The pizzas are large and very tasty. They're not made by some teenager that hates his part-time pizza job...they're made with love by someone who cares about his little family business and cares about every pizza that comes out of his oven. I also tried the lasagna on my last order and it's good. I'm tired of restaurants that think that more meat and more cheese makes for a great lasagna. La Famiglia knows that great flavour in lasagna is all about the seasoning. Of course, it's nothing compared to my mother's lasagna, but no restaurant has been able to beat her yet.  Way to go La Famiglia."}
{"text":"Ordered from here and it was sooooooo amazing.  I Had a great experience. When i called to place my order i heard cooks Playfully arguing and the women on the phone was so sweet with her strong accent . Sounded so authentic italian and tasted it too!! 100 stars!"}
{"text":"Had pizza, a salad and a garlic roll.  The garlic roll was excellent.  The pizza reminded me of being back in Long Island.  Even met an Uncle of the Family from Islip Terrace- What a treat!  The food was great, the service was exceptional and of course I enjoyed the company because we talked about growing up in Long Island.  Good food, I will go back there for my pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Called on a Sunday night to place an order for pick up. The guy places me on hold for at least 2 minutes then comes back and asks for my phone number. I give it to him, but he doesn't hear it and when I start to repeat for the third time, he interrupts me to ask me if he can put me on hold again! I hung up. I drove down instead (I was on my way anyway but thought I'd save some time by calling en route).  When I get there, I notice how nice the place actually looks! The patio looks great and inside is open and airy. But not so busy which, even for a Sunday night, isn't a great sign. I used to eat here when it was a little place on Warner and Alma School. I always thought they were pretty good: I've had their pizza and Calzones before and not bad. Back to the present: I stood at the counter while a young kid stood there taking an order on the phone  for a couple minutes, trying to be patient, but it was taking a long time considering it was for a large pizza delivery, oh wait, that'll take an hour? 25 minutes for pick-up, okay...tap, tap, tap on the screen to seemingly change the whole order, and oh MY... then the waitress is back and forth a couple times and there is a woman sitting at a table nearby with a lap top who I assume is an owner. Finally the kid takes my order. I start off by letting him know that I'm the person who had been told to hold twice while trying to give my order over the phone. He looks sheepish and apolgizes. And yes, I did point out that is a customer service no-no. Okay, I know I'm a little hangry, but I say, \"it's okay\" and smile. I feel bad for him that I have told him off and I know I'm not being nice...but I felt I had to say it.   The aforementioned waitress walks by during my little speech and smiles nicely. She continues to make eye contact and even when we leave she says \"good-bye, have a nice night\"...you know, and the kid was really sweet and was having trouble with some ordering system, which he explains is what kept him from taking my order over the phone. Whatever, I just order a meatball sub and plain spaghetti with meatballs for my kiddo, then wait. The owner sat there the whole time on her computer and discussed with the waitress and the kid the problem they were having with \"grub hub\"...she never spoke to me, not that she needed to, but you might say something to make nice to an angry customer! Throw me a free garlic knot or something, or even a little verbal exchange while I sat on the window sill with my daughter waiting for our food (awkwardly there's no chairs even though there are two separate entrances and people waiting for take out don't have anywhere to go while they wait).  Okay, I get wordy...the gist is that I spent $21+ for plain spaghetti with (2) meatballs and a meatball sub with mozzarella cheese. That's a little spendy to me, but the sub was delicious and the pasta looked pretty good. Kiddo ate a whole meatball which was good since she's usually pretty picky about that kind of thing.   Up your game a bit, LA Famiglia and you could probably fill more of those tables on a Sunday night! We will probably come back and sit down on that patio, then I can give another wordy review!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I love that it's family owned and that they make everything from scratch. Sure that makes the orders take a little longer, but I would rather wait for fresh food then have something pre-made come out quickly.   My family and I went here for a birthday dinner and they made us feel so welcome. The owner even came by to check on us and chat with us, which was a really nice touch!  My husband and I pick-up food from here all the time.   Everything we've had has been great. Amazing calzones, great pizza and best authentic pasta dishes in town  Definitely the best Italian restaurant we've found in the valley (and we've been here for 12 years)!"}
{"text":"I want to rate it better out of sympathy, but I just can't bring myself to it.    We love trying out small, family-owned, hole in the wall joints.  This one I had seen several times in a dying Walmart plaza nearby our house so we decided to give it a try after shopping.    One you walk in, you'll be surprised by how small and crowded it is.  There was only 2 other parties in there at the same time as us, yet somehow everything was still very slow.  Slow to get any service and even slower to get our food.  We were rarely checked on and honestly did not feel welcome.  We decided to wait it out since we had no other plans anyways.    The prices seem way to high, in my opinion, for a small busted looking place like this so I fully expected the food to be amazing.  After almost an hour, we finally received a cheese pizza and baked pasta.  The portion size of the pasta was small and nothing special - I make it better at home; However, the pizza WAS good and my boyfriend really enjoyed it a lot.  If he were rating the place, he'd probably give it another star based off the pizza alone (but he's not \"Yelp cool\" yet so oh well).  I think it also took about 10 minutes or so after we had already completed eating till we finally received our bill.  That's a bit unprofessional.  OVERALL:  This place is good for the pizza, that's it!  I would never recommend dining in... just order it to go and eat it on the elegance of your couch -- because your couch probably has a better atmosphere than here."}
{"text":"Last night I had the meat lovers pizza I was pleased with the amount of toppings an the way it was prepared . I gave three stars because I don't prefer the the style of pizza. I also don't like eating pizza with two hands. The service great also the delivery  was fast."}
{"text":"Finally, a nice family owned Italian restaurant near our house. Try the lasagna and a side of sausage. The sauce and spices are just right. My son loves the pizza. If you still have room try the Canolis. Mimmo, the owner was a baker in New York so the desserts here are a treat. You wont regret it. The service was good but could be improved. Everyone is nice and friendly. Great place to bring family and friends or a date.  Fair prices good food."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Arizona! !!!!! Crust crispy but delicate..sauce delish. Has just the right amount of everything.  Won't eat any other pizza now that I found La Famiglia."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Came in for a work lunch with 10 co workers. waiter/cook forgot an order and we didn't receive until everyone else was finished. Instead of comping the $7 lunch item he gave us ¢78 off the entire $100 bill. When questioned about the late food he just shrugged. Could've done better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They have great pizza! And the family that owns and operates it is so nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Sorry to give a 3. We drove by not realizing you had moved.  Got excited as we loved the old place and the warm family atmosphere.  Hate to say you lost that loving feeling.  We only observed one waitress for all tables. Her warm customer service skills were lacking or she was stressed not getting help. We are served warm ice tea,  had to ask for ice,  our salad showed at the same time as the pizza.  The wait was long not offered anything while waiting.  Not that busy.  Pizza was 'eh'....I agree with other posts,  it lacked flavor. I use to love your pizza.  Our tablecloth was dirty and no one bused our dirty dishes. When you move to a bigger place and raise your prices,  as customers we now expect more from you.  A higher level of service.  We want you to succeed. .... pls listen."}
{"text":"I just came and ordered dinner.  Unbelievable!!! the food is great.  The staff are attentive and very pleasent.  A total 5 star place.    David"}
{"text":"They bit up more than they can chew.  Slow slow slow.  We used to love going to their smaller location - but even there the friendly element was not there when it came to customer service.  When we visited the new place the mother owner just made excuses for the slow food. I don't care if the owner lady tries to convince us it's \"made to order and it takes time.  If people don't like it they don't have to come\".  Her words.  My family own pizza /Italian restaurants - very successful too and would NEVER say that to someone.  Esp if they value customers.  We were waiting for fried mozzarella sticks over 45 minutes.  The pizza never came.  We waited one hour for our pizza and just decided to leave.  Food is still delicious but I was livid at how this woman reacted to our wait.  Mozzarella sticks even \"made to order\"  should take 10 min Max.  If I were the family I would keep their mom away from the customers.  She doesn't help the situation."}
{"text":"Ive been ordering from them for about two years. Thanks to my friend John for introducing me to their pizzas. I've tried almost all of their pizzas and I am as satisfied as it gets. Even every customer agrees on the food that it is delicious.  It truly is. Very yummy. My husband always gets the chicken alfredo pasta with shrimp and is very happy with the portion and the level of deliciousness!  Reading a certain reader's perspective made me a little confused because not once have I seen the workers give bad service. As I was scrolling through her comment, it seemed that her focus was on \" specials\" and/or getting stuff for free and creating problems rather than focusing on dinner.   Don't worry La Famiglia, people have too much time on their hands!  Bravo on the food"}
{"text":"I was out and about running errands in Chandler. I really needed to eat something. So driving along to my next appt. I just thought I would stop at the next place I saw. This was it. Italian food is always good right! When I first walked in, it smelled wonderful. I decided on a Slice , Cheese with mushrooms. I need to  wash my hands so into the bathroom. It was very clean and nicely stocked. Which was good considering the lunch rush had just ended. I had brought lemon water with me and I do not drink soda so I just got the slice. I got a side of sauce which was free.  Can I just say wow!!! I have now found the best Pizza in the Valley! I have never really found too many places here in Phoenix and surrounding area that have good Pizza, so I am very happy.  I also noticed they Ariancini Balls( something you do not find very often). I asked the girl if they were for Dinner or a special order. No you can get them any time!!  I told Mario that night and we are going to go there for dinner the next night.  I do not know how they taste, but, the Pizza and sauce were really good. I looked up the website and they are a family owned and operated business from New York. Real Italians!! Real Food.  Just shows how you can stumble on something really good without expecting it.  I did notice that they had free WIFI also, lots of parking in the lot. They do have delivery during certain hours and some great lunch specials for pick up and dine in. The lunch specials are from 11-2 Monday thru Friday."}
{"text":"This is a 10 star eatery. My Note Investor Forum Meetup had to move to another location, as we outgrew their space. Staffing was great. Food was great. They truly looked out for all of our attendees. If you need a restaurant location, you need to book at La Famiglia  Dave ---Capstone Capital USA"}
{"text":"Don't worry, they didn't close.. Just RELOCATED!! We LOVE this restaurant!!The best New York style pizza and Italian food. Very family oriented and the owners make us feel like family at all of our visits. Both my husband and I are New Yorkers and I was soooo pleased and excited when I 1st entered there old place and recognized the owner almost immediately!! I looked at my husband and said.. I know that man.. He looks so familiar... OMG, that's the man that owned Mary's Pizzeria in Islip Terrace, NY..  My siblings and I grow up having Mary's Pizza.. We were sad when they sold the place back home to retire.... And years later, we found them again..only about oooohhhh 2500 miles away from home!!! The new location is beautiful, much bigger, and has a bar area. We are so happy and excited for them.  The whole staff is wonderful...they know our order.. Peppers, onion & sausage Stromboli, with hot wings and a large pie!!  We've also had there lasagna, eggplant and chicken parm... Everything is GREAT!!   A special thanks to the owner and family, for there kindness and warmth they give to us ALWAYS!!"}
{"text":"I have never gotten anything at La Famiglia that was not delicious. The pepperoni rolls are awesome and even better with cheese. I often get the tortellini, baked ziti, pizza, or chicken dishes. They have always been open to substitutions, e.g. different sauce than on the menu. I prefer loaf bread to the focaccia-style breadsticks they serve, but they are still good. My husband always orders extra garlic in his dish. The servers and hosts are always nice too."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice.. crust is crunchy and just right:)   We had a chance encounter with this place, by just driving by and decided to give it a whirl. Its a nice tiny eatery on the corner and it must be legit, because almost all the people ordering take-out and dining in were Italian.. We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at good prices! Do not let this little joint fool you. The pizza, turkey sub, lasagna & shell pasta are so great! Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I had someone recommend this place to me and I was so glad that he did.  Ever since we have eaten at La Famiglia we have not gone anywhere else for pizza.  They sometimes get busy but that's because they are so good.  An awesome family run business I think everyone should support plus their food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My only gripe with La Famiglia is the delivery, they used to have really awesome friendly delivery guys, but the newest kinda bigger dude seems rude and miserable. Bummer because their east coast style pizza is great! The wings are also on point!"}
{"text":"Small but cute. The wait staff was nice and the place is clean. Good pizza, pasta needed to be drained a little bit more but the marinara sauce was flavorful.  The place was real hot however.  Not too comfortable.  However, it won't stop me from trying it again."}
{"text":"BLECH! the garlic knots are VERY garlicky & the only good thing @ la fam. The madeira sauce is packet brown gravy & all the pastas are boxed or frozen & not home-made; which u think u'd fine at a mom & pop place like this. their marinara is soupy & same consistency as canned Chef Boyardee :( i wont go back!"}
{"text":"I agree totally with John D. post.  Every time we order a take out pizza they give us a pick up time and it is NEVER ready on time, even when the restaurant is not busy at all.  Its common to have to stand around for another 20 minutes waiting.  Also, I don't appreciate the fact then when you enter the take out door the \"family\" is often sitting around the big dining table right by the entrance eating and someone has to get up from their meal to help you with your order.  Awkward to say the least."}
{"text":"If you eat anything here, make it the baked rice balls. SO delicious!!! Everything we had was amazing. Canoli for dessert made it even better :) Friendly, fast service in a very family friendly atmosphere. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have not been to the new location due to the distance, but had bought a groupon, so we decided to make the trip. The place is much different than the old place, which was counter service. The new place waiter service and the atmosphere has stepped up with a full bar and great happy hour prices. We ordered the Sicilian pizza which was just as good as it was at the old location. love garlic knots and the delicious sauce.  The service was very good and would plan to make the trip to Mesa again, maybe try the pasta dishes, although we cant pass up the pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Since discovering this place, my family does not order pizza from anywhere else. The chicken wings are excellent, especially the honey BBQ. The sandwiches are fantastic as well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My original review was in 2010 so it is time to update!  The place looks exactly the same - no changes there which is fine. It still seems like the same family operated business, which is good.  The TV is on with the Olympics on, YES!  So nothing here has changed. I still love the pizza. I did get a normal crust this time which wasn't as much as the Sicilian. The Sicilian was a total beast of a pizza - still I'd vote fit for a group of men.  The four stars on this place remains! Not the absolute best pizza I've ever had, but one of the best in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and entrees. Friendly service. The Best place I get my pizza from when I'm on my side of town.\" Don't forget to try the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Like to support local business but you guys need help.  First thing I hear is bickering back and forth between probably owner or owners wife and employees. NICE! Good start.  I usually have to order a pizza here and there for others. Ordering take out is a pain. Said 20 minutes. Show up 25 minutes later and the pizza is not even made and in the oven. Value my time, I will value your business. This has happened three times now. Just tell me it's going to be an hour. I will be there in a hour.  Also, when calling. I've been placed on hold for longer than 10 minutes and no one picks up the line. If they do, can you hold again please? Or I get disconnected. Come on man!   I also don't enjoy seeing a full setup of your office bills, computer, phone and other get up in the booth next to the takeout counter. This is not your home. Take it in the back office. It's a place to eat right? Give yourself the best visual experience for the customer and keep it clean.  I actually like your pizza. You just need to fix all of the extra crap and nonsense. I'm sure you guys would be much busier and be killing it in the $ department if that was the case."}
{"text":"Best I've found so far...if you're looking for New York style. Which is the only type I will eat. Absolutely can't handle a bite of the gut bomb carb loaded stuff that's with Chicago style & deep dishes, etc. Its not that cheffy/artisan type. Its the fast pace, family owned pizza joint.  Note: for some reason it tastes better in house. It loses something in box on a drive. The crispness of crust...? Its small inside. If group, its tight but happy"}
{"text":"The best Italian food!!! Biggest XL pizza special anywhere. Ask for it New York style and they'll make it a thin crust. Which is less doughy and tonnes more tasty. Foods better than those pricey restaurants on avenue road or st clair avenue west. Without previous knowledge of this place you'd likely just drive by.....even when you see the seating area you probably just walk out. But we love the company of the husband(pizza maker)and wife(pasta preper)business. We eat here sometimes once a week (sometimes twice ; )) Wifey loves their alfredo sauce and i love their meat sauce. You chose your type of pasta and sauce preference too! Lunch specials too!!! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place,   Pizzas, salads, service, quality, flavour ... it is all there  I recommend the Hawaiian pizza, real treat, just enough topping to make it pretty much the best hawaiian I have had in Toronto"}
{"text":"I had the pizza and it was really pretty good.   However, there are lots of places to get good pizza.   I was with a large group. (about 40 people with about 20 separate tabs) They added an 18 or 20% gratuity to each of the tabs. Fair enough. However, the waitress then added an additional amount onto my tab giving herself a grand total of 42% gratuity! Since someone else planned the outing, I didn't get the manager or say anything. There were too many of my group around and I didn't want to make a scene. She knew that! I'm sure she did the same with anyone else that paid cash. She just never brought anyone any change. Nice trick!  Won't ever go there again. If I go with the group again, I won't order anything, or I'll bring exact change.  Bad ju-ju!! Padding your tip is a no-no!! Wait service school course 101"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in Arizona. They have an excellent full menu. Great big wings. Closest pizza to north east pizza we've had in Arizona. We go there very often and have enjoyed everything we've tried. I am glad we are near by."}
{"text":"Been coming to La Famiglia since 2004 they recently moved to this location and maybe they are now too big because the service was AWFUL and the food not nearly as good as it was when they were a small local place.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Ordered from them randomly based on a flyer and absolutely loved the service and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Went to a party for a friend about 50 guests. The food was very good. First course was an assortment of cheeses and meats with bread and rice balls.  Main course was baked ziti or egplant parm. Salad and chicken picatta.  Cake for dessert. Service was very good! Will be back next month when they have their liquor license.  Cuz thats how I roll..."}
{"text":"First time here this evening and food was yummy. The decor is a little outdated and the entrance doesn't provide much of an inviting area or place of respite if you were waiting for your table. It wasn't super busy when we arrived but slowly picked up while we were there. We asked for recommendations from the waiter and we selected the Stromboli, hero sandwich, and garlic bites that he recommended, all were delicious. The table next to us had pizza and pasta, and it too looked good. Large portions, as we had leftovers from out dinner. Looking forward to trying their specialty pizzas or even dessert next time. Wish the service was a little better, but our waiters swapped mid way through and the gal that helped us in the later half of our dinner experience was nice and apologetic for being busy. Didn't quite understand the swap. They are accommodating for young kids, but no children's menu? Or we did not receive one anyways. And do they serve free bread? It seemed like the other tables got complementary bread but we didn't get anything. Also, their water tastes funny, maybe time to upgrade the water filter system. But overall good food so we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome Stromboli. Are here at about 5pm and there was about a quarter of the restaurant occupied. A group of cops are here and it's obvious this place is cop friendly. That alone guaranteed the 5stars. They support the thin blue line. That's enough for me!  See you guys again soon"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting pizza, much better than the chains (guess that goes without saying, bar is pretty low anyways). Service is also very good - it's a family run business. One of those hidden gems. Will be coming back to try the other menu offerings like calzones and lasagnas."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for a wedding. We were treated to Friday night dinner for Pizza and salad and then on Saturday night they did the catering for the event. Let me start off by saying carbs are a treat. The pizza was warm and delish. The garlic knots were the bomb! Saturday night dinner was baked zitti, eggplant parm, chicken parm meatballs and salad. Everything was so good. The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The eggplant tasted like it was made with care and love. The meatball well don't get me started. I am back in San Diego still thinking about this place. They did a wonderful job getting people served with smiles all around. I was so impressed.  Maybe they will want to move to San Diego....."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food was really good. The meatballs were tender and spiced just right, and the pasta had a nice texture to it.  I probably won't be going back here though.  The lady in the front seems like she hates the world and the service is pretty slow.   I think the negative attitude might be an 'authentic' italian thing, but I don't want to go to some place and hear about people's problems.  I just want some meatballs.  For the price, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Very happy we found this place. Love the Monday night pasta and am very happy with the scratch kitchen. Meatballs are awesome and the Alfredo is deelish. Very nice family! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta Pizza, Greek Salad, Cannoli: The pizza was overwhelming with raw onions and garlic. Too many tomatoes piled on a soaked crust and box. When I picked it up to move it, it fell through the box and all over the carpet. Huge mess! The salad consisted of brown, wilted iceburg lettuce. Awful, horrible experience!! Very expensive, not including the professional carpet cleaning I had to pay for."}
{"text":"Like the stars say, \"Meh. I've had better\".  I had the Stromboli and it was burnt all the way through.  On of my kids had the cheese pizza and it was so thin that it too was burnt.  My other kids had the lasagna and it was good but not great.  I think the best part of this experience was the diet coke... at least I knew what I was getting. We tried to sit outside to eat, but were told we aren't allowed, because \"he\" hasn't opened it, yet.  The door to the outdoor seating was open and who is \"he\"?  Grrr... I probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"This is the best New York style pizza place I have found in the East valley...also, \"leave the gun and try the canoli!\""}
{"text":"Quality thin style pizza! We've ordered several times now, always arrives hot and fresh! They take your credit card by phone."}
{"text":"This place was great! We thought we would try it since its in our neighborhood and were always looking for new restaurants...we had a pepperoni pizza and the fettucini Alfredo with chicken and both were delicious! Were happy also that they deliver and that you can stop in and grab a slice of pizza. So glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. If your looking for the pizza with the most tasty crust, this is the place. I thought I died and went to pizza heaven. I will be back again and again. I had only two slices and a drink and I was full. Prices are wonderful too. I got my 2 year old some pasta and meat sauce and that too was incredible.  Seriously you need to go!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love, love, love, love, love this place. LOVE.  As the daughter of a New York Italian who knows her way around the kitchen, it's so wonderful to find a place that has food almost exactly like moms.    The pizza is fantastic, as good as real NY pizza, and even better than some places in NY.  And the wings are AMAZING.  One thing I will say about the wings, I generally order the hot sauce on the SIDE.  It's a very hot sauce and they are drenched in it.  I find the medium sauce to be a bit bland and greasy, so I find that just being able to control the amount of hot sauce I have is the best option.  But the wings themselves are delicious and crispy.  None of that fatty, flappy, grisly bits you get at chain pizza places.  I usually expect the actual entrees at a pizza place to be pretty bad.  Before trying their entrees, I had never had a positive experience with pasta or Italian entrees at pizza places.  But La Famiglia's entrees and pasta is delicious.  Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes and I love theirs.  Their tortellini pesto is quite good too.  A bit heavy on the pesto, but that's just being nitpicky.  Cannolis? Amazing. They used to have Black and White cookies that were so delicious, but apparently no one orders them so they no longer make them.  I do hope people start requesting them more so they will bring them back!  I'm not in LOVE with most of their other appetizers.  The batter on their fried foods (calamari, zucchini, etc.) is a bit heavy for me and I feel a bit sick after just a few bites and find I don't want to eat anything else.  So I never order them.  I do wish they'd reconsider the batter and come up with something lighter because I'd love to be able to get some calamari.  I also wish the calamari was just rings and not the tentacles, because... well.. tentacles.  My one other criticism is that they are pretty strict and misleading about their hours.  They say it's delivery until 8:00PM on the weekdays, but if you call after 7:30PM, you're out of luck.  I think this is far too early to stop delivery to begin with, but if you are going to advertise for 8:00PM, I think you should take orders until 8:00PM.  I did see some reviews about rude staff.  I did have ONE bad experience awhile back, but haven't had any trouble since.  It's family owned and operated, with a few non-family employees.  And, well, everyone has a bad day.  My one experience hasn't deterred me from going, nor has their rigid policies on their hours.  Overall, I still give it 5 full stars, regardless of personal feelings about some menu items or policies because the food is good enough that it really doesn't even matter.   Please go.. and request black and white cookies so I can have them again!"}
{"text":"Being from NY been hard pressed to find a truly good family owned Italian resturant Yeah this is it. We normally order to go but recently decided to ear in. Thier was myself my wife my son and Grandaughter. You can tell this a family place just by all the groups sitting at Tables. Good service one minor note kids menus should always have crayons. We already.love the Pizza sliced sausage is the best. My wife is a sticker for fettuccine Alfredo  and the sauce her is the best we have had anywhere. OK I seen some of the poor reviews here and to date I have no issues though   I will say if you order to go there thing a bit off if they say 20 min more like 30. BTW few places in this town to get a good cannoli"}
{"text":"Finally found New York pizza ....great crust ,great sauce and nice people,next time we are dining in"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of 8 on a Saturday at 3:30pm. Our waitress was slow and kept disappearing. My father-in-law had to hunt down the waitress for a drink refill. The pizza was good and had a nice zesty sauce. My husband and I ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they weren't fresh at all. The cheese had turned solid and you could tell they were sitting for a while before they were brought to our table. I wanted to complain and get a new batch but my husband said they were fine. They weren't. I also ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken for around $17. My meal had way too much Alfredo sauce with the pasta. I was getting mouthfuls of sauce with each bite. It would have been delicious if my pasta wasn't drowning. We didn't get the comp. bread for the table until just before our dinners came out. That bread was cold. My husband loved the stuffed shells he ordered though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place .. my husband and I are vacationing in the Scottsdale area and figured we would try this place out ..  we got the grandma pizza and the penne ala vodka.. both delicious! And our waitress was great and friendly .. would definitely come back ."}
{"text":"Sicilian style.  Great pizza.  Try the Grandma Pizza.  It is delicious!  The lunch special is super cheap for pasta/pizza + soda + salad for $5.55 + tax.  Family owned and operated business.  The patio is nice and shaded.  I enjoy sitting out there on my lunch hour.  Good people!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty good. We have a pretty large group and our server keeps busy and does well. Food is consistently good. Like the pizza options. Calzone is huge and their lunch pasta dishes are the perfect sizes. Basic salads are fine but the dinner portions are pretty good sized."}
{"text":"OK; I know I might sound schizophrenic, but I am updating my review to 4 stars.  Went for a massive lunch yesterday with my GF and we enjoyed ourselves very much.  The trick is now after eating at this restaurant for a number of times, we now know what is good and what not to order.  And this time we got a waitress who knew what she was doing, provided great service, and was not a numbskull -- this makes a huge difference to your dining experience.  Like I said in my last review, I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was excellent again.  My GF ordered the bruschetta app and it too was very good.  We ordered a Greek salad and we knew it was big enough for us to share (and even big enough that after we had a large serving each, we still had two servings of salad to take home for dinner).  Comment here -- we learned that the Greek salad is excellent, but the antipasti plate is nothing more than a simple Italian salad with some cheese and salami slices on it.  We both thought that the Greek salad was a better option.  I ordered the veal marsala over linguine for my entrée and my GF ordered the ham/pepperoni/cheese Stromboli.  Both entrees were very good and I loved the thicker and heartier marsala gravy on my entrée (not the classical thin gravy).  The Stromboli was about 10-12 inches long and baked nicely and filled with ham/cheese/pepperoni.  A final comment -- note that we ordered dishes that did not have their marinara in them or on top of them.  IMHO their marinara is really bad, but the other dishes without marinara are very good.  I know that some people will say that this restaurant's marinara sauce is OK or good, but not IMO......just saying."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. The food was fresh to order and service was prompt. The only negative is the attendants behind the desert stand. They should have been more attentive to my questions. I probably would have bought something if they answered my questions in a friendly tone rather than focusing their attention on their iPad. Overall good food and dining service. I love the spinach gnocchi."}
{"text":"After months of seeing the girls in the office enjoying what always appeared to be fresh pasta, I ventured into La Famiglia last week to finally give it a try - and am kicking myself for not going 8 months ago when I started working in this area!!    The wait is a little long for lunch, so don't go expecting something out of the microwave and in your hand in 5 minutes.  It is all made/baked to order and takes a little more time.  With lunch specials of pasta, side salad and a drink for $5.95, it is well worth the wait!    Last week I tried their Italian Hero sandwich, it was so good.  I had always been a fan of Cousins Subs and didn't think anything would beat their Italian - until I had it here.  Today, I tried the stuffed shells.  Again, delicious.  Cooked to perfection and the flavors making my taste buds want more and more.  My only gripe would be that they don't give you any garlic rolls with the lunch specials, and they are much needed for the sauce after your finished the pasta - no note to self, next time order a side of them!   I look forward to tasting each and every item on the menu in the next few weeks."}
{"text":"Pizza & wings are amazing.. but honestly I feel this place has a thing against Hispanics, every time we dine in they sit us in a back corner & take an extremely long time to bring us out our food. There was a table that sat down after us & got their food before we did. Our waitress had such bad customer service."}
{"text":"SOOO SLOW!   Seriously.  We've been waiting for an hour.  For spaghetti.  No wonder there are only four other tables of people here. The garlic knots are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't my favorite but the pepperoni we had was good. What I really liked was the calamari. It was an appetizer but plenty enough for a meal for one or two ppl. It was $10 but worth every penny. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some lunch with a few coworkers at La Famiglia.   The food was pretty bad. Everything tastes like it came from a can. The prices are very reasonable, but the food quality reflected this heavily.  I also found it strange they would play the walking dead on the TV's during lunch hour. The young kids in the front were loving it, but I prefer to eat my food without the sounds of flesh being consumed by zombies. Call me weird, just a preference.   Overall, this place is a pass for the future unless I am behind on the walking dead and need to catch up quickly during lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian! This place just opened up in our neighborhood, Dobson Ranch, and the family owned atmosphere was comfortable and clean. The menu is all Italian fare, complete with the best homemade Chicken Parmesan I've ever had. We happened by their first day open, the service was smooth and friendly, I never would have known it was their first day! All that being said, give it a try and don't pass on the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Ordered a dinner. Comes with bread and salad. Salad was a small palm full of ice berg lettuce, one slice of tomato cut in quarters and two olives. Side bread was not Italian bread my Italian mother from Italy used to serve. The pasta itself was very hearty portioned and well prepared. Compared to other places I've tried the food so far is better here except for their salad and side bread. Also tried the hot subs. Really good. Not over sauced or soggy. Veal especially is very tender. Easily customizable on request when you phone in. Delivery was prompt. Prices are very fair for what you get. I'm picky since I'm Italian so I took one star off for the sides of bread and salad but overall it's a place I do recommend for delivery when you're too tired or busy to cook yourself, or, you can't cook. I'm now a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I've been going to La Famiglia since its first location.    The subs are usually very good but not always consistent.  Sometimes they toast the bread and sometimes they don't.  It gets kind of confusing.    The pizza is always my favorite.  It's probably the closest thing to NY Style pizza that I have found in AZ.    Be ready to wait a little longer than they quote you.  If they tell me 10 minutes it usually more like 20.  Last time I ordered a pizza for take out over the phone.  They told me it would be ready in 25-30 minutes.  I get there after 30 minutes and end up waiting another 25 minutes.  Worst part is they were not busy.  Lucky for them the food is good so I put up with it.  I would love to give them 5 stars but the lack of consistency and slow service cause a star to be lost.  I'm still a fan and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"Some of the best New York Style pizza I've eaten.  You won't regret ordering from here. Definitely in my top 5 pizza joints in T.O."}
{"text":"Portions are huge. Food not so good. I think the red sauce came from a can. Chairs could use an update. Its to open so private conversations are not private. The girl across the room told are table about her whole relationship with a guy she had a one night stand with. Definitely annoying as we are trying to have a family meal. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"First off, you have to get their thin crust Sicilian pizza.  They call it the 'Grandma Pizza'.  It is bar none the best pizza ever.  I kid you not.  The Chicken Alfredo is excellent.  The spaghetti is awesome.  Just about everything they have is excellent, including the Philly Cheesesteak (I get mine with marinara and the cheese/steak.  You won't find a better value, anywhere.  I've been eating here for the past 4 years.  If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out.  Plus, the new large restaurant is a nice upgrade from what they had at the old location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend spoke very highly of this place.....ehh it was ok. They really need some different color paint on the walls. Its just white.....not a very \"Italian\" looking restaurant. Service was good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new local pizza restaurant and decided to give this one a try.  Situated in the tired old strip plazas on O'Connor, it's a hidden gem.  This looks to be a family-run business.  Staff were lovely and the shop was clean.  Pizza sizes are quite large.  We got an extra-large and side order of bread knots for take-away.  The food was fresh and well made.  The marinara sauce to dip knots in seemed as if it may have been home made.  Very good!  Although we usually prefer a thicker crust, the pizza was a delicious thin crust that we very much enjoyed, with generous amount toppings.  Will definitely be back here to try other items."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the big pizza chains and their blandness then give this place a call.  It's got a real home-made taste to it and their prices are hard to beat.  They have many different types of pizzas, everything from your plain cheese to a philly cheese steak pizza.  All of the classic pizza joint appetizers like chicken wings, bread sticks, etc....  I ordered a medium Italian Pizza (Red Peppers, Pepperoni, Sausage, Cheese, Marinara) and 10 boneless chicken wings. For 2 people it was just right. The medium is the size of a large at some places and the boneless wings were huge chucks of white chicken breast marinated in a kick ass hot sauce.  The delivery time was about 50 minutes and the price was only $30 including a $2.50 tip.  Also according to their delivery flyer they have a catering service with real Italian food with all the good pastas and meats."}
{"text":"Awesome NYC family style food.  Great memories of home.   Wonderful food at reasonable price.  Great service by friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ok, I generally do not like Italian food.  I just don't care for pasta.  Well, La Familgia changed that for me!    I brought the wife here on a whim.  I had some of the best veal I've had the pleasure of eating.  This included a side of tortalini.  I hate to admit it, but the pasta sold me more,then the meat.  We've come back for several visits since.  Each time just gets better and better.  The portions are huge, the quality is the best.  Everything is made fresh and to order.    Is it pricey?  Not for the quality, and quantity of food get.    Add to this, it is a family run restaurant.  The owners are super sweet and want you too feel like family."}
{"text":"My bf was craving Italian so we decided to give this place a try, since it is close to our apartment.  He had the linguine and clams, which was pretty good- lots of clams though they were clearly canned. I was horribly disappointed in my gnocchi, it was pretty much overstuffed cheese ravioli with generic marinara...come on it's Italian food, where is the basil? garlic? oregano? Anything??   That being said this would have been a 2 star review were it not for the cannoli. Amazing. I would go back just for this, but I doubt I'd bother to do dinner there again."}

{"text":"Simply good food. When you come in here you have to think big. Big plates, big cups... Authentic NY style pizza. Great tasting food.  Friendly service. Got to try it 'coz We love it!"}
{"text":"Best fetticini Alfredo I've ever had.  I can't go to other restaurants and order it because nothing compares to theirs.  Garlic knots are yummy too."}
{"text":"Great local Italian spot. They have a crispy chicken sandwich for only $7.50 that is simple but delicious. The pesto tortellini is great and I have had their Hawaiian and Bruschetta pizza's. Delivers nearby as well."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli, the pizza here is phenomenal. The bread is amazing. The ranch dressing is awesome. I've never been during happy hour but the bottles of wine are incredibly inexpensive regardless. Isaiah has been my server both times and he is the best!"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 star restaurant experience.  It is a hidden gem in the area as it is stowed away in a non-descript row of shops.  There were plenty of people that stopped in to pick-up their orders so I could tell it was a popular place amongst the locals.  This has a family-style atmosphere and I think it is a family-owned labour of love.  They do thin crust style pizza and their menu offers a lot of white sauce style pizzas.  The toppings are not your text-book pepperoni and etc combinations but rather more Italy-inspired like Shrimp Scampi or Clam Casina.  Between the four of us, we settled on ordering a medium chicken alfredo and a medium mediterranean pizza.  They brought it out fresh out of the oven that the cheese was still bubbling.  The toppings were plentiful (especially the olives on the Mediterranean!) while the underneath crust was crispy and crunchy.  Would definitely drop back in here when I am passing through the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a slice of pizza and beer. BEST PIZZA I'VE HAD SINCE NYC! Authentic and full of flavor. Staff is very friendly and full of smiles, as well! First time in and will be most definitely returning whenever I get these pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Great food. Mimmo has a great staff headed up by his daughter Bonnie. This is our Friday night fun and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is amazing.  Crispy crust and wonderful sauce.  The lasagna is to die for.  Very nice atmosphere (not a dive).    They are nice people and family owned.    It's the best pizza I have had in Arizona so far and I have tried about 6 or 7 different pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Bacon. They murder their pizzas with bacon. You must eat here!  Seriously. Great toppings that are not skimped on, crispy thin crust, well seasoned. Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"I am from jersey and I can tell you the calzone I just ate was as good as the pizza place ramonos by my childhood home. Honestly this was my second trip here and I don't remember what got last time. I don't remember being impressed. But today was awesome. Ny style calzone. Ill go back and report back on the pizza.  I didn't think the water in az was right for real ny style.  But I was wrong. If you want ny calzone run don't walk to this place. Outstanding. probably then best diet coke and calzone in Arizona.  they are moving down the street to quadalupe in may."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. Best NY style pizza around. Garlic knots and salads are delicious. They now have a full bar and great deals on Happy Hour 3-6.  Try the sampler at happy hour, 6 wings, 4 bruschetta, 4 garlic knots, 4 mozzarella sticks, Only $5!!!"}
{"text":"So I think I spoke far too soon about this place. I ordered this evening, cheese sticks, pizza and onion rings. This was our 3rd time ordering from these folks. We were starving, when the food came, each dish was over cooked a dry. I called and mentioned it to the cook and he got upset and started yelling at me. I will never order from this place ever again. He told me that me food was fine. Ok, try and eat your own food, you tell me if your gums are sore after you eat if that normal and ok? Stay away, far away."}
{"text":"A true family restaurant.  I love the Pizza here.  My 1st time with friends late on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, we actually closed the place down.  Thank you Mimmo Randazzo for sharing with me! You are the kindest man and so proud of his family. He showed his beautiful grandchildren off as babies in HUGE frames. A darling little girl, now 3yrs old and his grandson @ 3 month's.  Gratefully,  Katrina Allen"}
{"text":"I've eaten at LaFam since the grand opening party of the old restaurant space in Chandler. Every time I visit Phoenix this is the first place I eat."}
{"text":"I've tried food from here three more times, it keeps getting worse. The quality just keeps sinking.  Most of the food tastes like reheated frozen food. Actually, I've had better frozen italian from the grocery store.  Big portions of ill tasting food, and not cheap either."}
{"text":"They have the best pesto tortellini I've ever had! Also tried their Hawaiian Pizza today and it was delicious! Down to the crust. Service was also great, we sat at the bar. I have been coming to La Famiglia when they were in Chandler and am still enjoying their food and service!"}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times from here now and I'm a fan. The XL 18\" pizza is huge and ends up being around $30 after taxes and delivery. They don't skimp on toppings and they are usually spread out evenly. If you get something with bacon, they use a lot - maybe even too much (I know, I know, is that really a thing...). They were happy to do a half-half pizza for me at no extra charge, which was appreciated. Just a thin layer of sauce, which makes for a well-balanced pizza. The crust is thin the way I like it, not Napolitan-style thin but with a little bit of substance. Great reheated the next day.  I like how they have their full menu online, and they have many options that aren't pizza. However ordering online was a bit weird - I had chosen to pay via credit card at the door, but the system still made my input my credit card online for what I understood to be verification purposes. When the driver showed up, he said that my pizza was already paid for and walked off. I felt a bit bad because this meant that I accidentally didn't tip him (didn't have cash with me at the bottom of my staircase). You can order so that the pizza arrives at a future time, and the one time I tried this, the driver arrived exactly on time. If you do pick up the pizza, the small shop is like a fast food restaurant with a few small tables you can sit at, but I wouldn't recommend 'dining in'.   I'd definitely recommend it, though I don't consider it cheap, and they didn't have any specials the few times I've ordered."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!!!  The prices are great and the food was amazing. We had a Greek salad that was so fresh. I know it was freshly cut made to order.  The lasagna was very good. Per my husband. The gluten free pizza was one of the best I have ever had.   $2 bottled beer for happy hour!!!!  Yes please.....  The owner and his family were absolutely the nicest people I've ever met. Very friendly and cared that we are having a great time at dinner. Anyway...  5 star and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great, fresh clean, employees are very nice, It's a great neighbourhood pizzeria with a decent selection of food"}
{"text":"Delicious high quality pizza. Our company orders from here a few  times a month and they have consistently shown to have a quality product...the spinach pizza is flavorful but not greasy; the cheese pizza is good enough not to need toppings....it's just all around a great place to frequent!"}
{"text":"I asked my daughter in Arizona where she wanted to go for her birthday for lunch and for whatever reason she picked this place.  It was truly nothing special.  We had been to at least two other Italian restaurants during my stay in Chandler that were way better.  I got the Spaghetti with Clam sauce, which I tend to get whenever it is on the menu, and it was not nearly as good as what I get at our favorite place in San Diego or what I got at the Pesto Pizza and Calzone down the road.  My daughter got the Cannelloni and she also said it wasn't as good as the other place.  Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!   Their pizza is my favorite of anywhere in AZ.  Their strombolis are absolutely fantastic and maybe the best food on earth.    The folks have always been friendly even back to when they were on Alma School and Warner.  There are some new faces now and they seem to be just as nice.    The service was fast and friendly and the food great!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic white , red, and wines sauces homemade fresh. Good portion sizes on the pasta"}
{"text":"Since I myself have only made the trip to New York twice, I cannot be considered an expert on NY-style pizza. But a friend who lived in the Big Apple swears this is the best authentic NY pizza in the area. NY-or-not, all I know is it tastes amazing. The homemade sauce is killer, the toppings fresh and tasty, and the crust thin and chewy. Mmmm. The cheesecake is also wonderful. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We found this place through Grub Hub- we have never been to the resturant itself but we have ordered their food for three nights and we tried a little bit of everything. Their eggplant parm is amazing and very tasty. Its as if they add something 'extra' to the breading that other places don't. My husband had a sandwich and he said the filling was great along with the dressing but the bread was a bit hard.   The appetizers don't fail- I go for the appetizer that has cheese sticks, zuchnni, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in it and it really wonderful. The deserts also don't fail.   We did try the stuffed pizza and we had mixed reviews here- I love it, my daughter loved it but since it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and my husband not being a fan of ricotta it didn't go over too well. The large pizza is HUGE to say the least and they don't skimp on toppings.   I recommend this resturant if you want pizza, pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread..Other then that, Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay, it's an okay place to stop if you are in a hurry and want some pizza. However, there are much better options if you are setting out for the night with the intent to eat pizza. Prices are high for what you get and the service is much to be desired. Usually the girl running the counter acts like there are much better places she would rather be. So on that note, there are much better pizza places I would like to be at than here."}
{"text":"My name is Connie and I attended a 70th birthday party in the private party room held by the Urso family...The service is spectacular. New York speed and style...Waitress was so friendly and efficient..Most of all ,the food is out of this world...This is a true New York Italian family. The rice balls, ziti,chicken parmigiana etc ,is to die for...Thank you guys...Your restaurant will very highly recommended by me...Out of town guests from Chicago and New York raved about the food....THE BEST...WE WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have visited the old location several times and was happy to see that this family business was expanding to a bigger location.  Tonight,  we ate at the new location and I went there being hopeful, the new location is very nice, spaceous and left disappointed. We were the second table in an empty place,  kinda sad. I've seen their old place BUSY. The server who assuming a high school aged guy was nice enough but did bare minimum. I even got up to grab silverware for our table. We've continued to come here because he likes the calzones, however the pizza isn't NY pizza and kind of tasteless.  You would think it should more or less be the same.  Truthfully,  I want mom and pop shops to succeed but something is missing... maybe cooked with love :("}
{"text":"The service was not great. The waitress never noticed that we came in. They brought us a salad with no forks or napkins. It took a few minutes for someone to look in our direction so we could flag them down. The salad was alright for the price. Places like Rigatony's give this same salad for free and it is much better tasting. During the pasta course they brought us no bread and yet again we had to flag them down. I find it annoying when I see tables adjacent to us get visited more times than a brothel. I enjoyed the pasta but got no refill on my drink. I didn't feel like bothering them for more. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite pizza. Pastas are amazing too. My daughter loves the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken."}
{"text":"Best AZ NY Style Pizza in the Valley. Pleasant atmo, hard workin personable staff. What more ya need?  The setup-  Last Friday, after picking me up at Sky Harbor, Darcie treated me to my first visit to La Famiglia. It was like God looked down and said, \"Baldy, you're had a rough week away from your family. Rest and recuperate with my gift to Arizona NY Pizza lovers.\" I poured myself into a chair and the awesome began to happen around me. Thank you lord. Thank you Darcie. Thank you La Famiglia.  So exhausted. So transported. So satisfied. A better, more thorough review of LF's awesomeness when I escape from my hibernation.  Shout out to the Beautiful Enza! Look forward to seeing you and your also hard-workin husband some time soon. Thanks for the cannolis."}
{"text":"I can only say that anyone not giving this place high ratings is obviously NOT from NY.  This is the real deal.  I drive all the way from north central to get a pie.  For anyone who wants a true 'back home' experience, get the pizza!! I can't comment on the other items because I can't stop ordering the pizza.  It's true that the girl behind the counter isn't always the friendliest - but hey, that's just like NY too."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow. The girls were all catering to and chatting with a big table of people who seemed to be people who might have been in charge there, but those in-chargers didnt seem to care that customers were being ignored. When you finally get your food, it is a letdown. Mediocre at best.  There are much better pizzas and italian restaurants out there. We do not recommend."}
{"text":"The Sicilian pizza was a little too doughy the last time we ate there.  However usually the food is pretty good so we will be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Do not get delivery. Giving 2 stars because they were faster than Grub Hub quoted, and the chicken in our pasta dish had the good grill flavor, but that was it for good points. The pasta primavera sauce was bland and the veggies were disgusting. We couldn't take a bite without adding salt and pepper or we'd die. And I never do that. The Shrimp Scampi was so overpriced considering it was 6 rubbery shrimp and spaghetti noodles with Olive oil, and absolutely nothing else to make it slightly better than what I could've done at home with a box and a jar. Come on, toss in some dehydrated chives, maybe a few little roasted garlic chunks, SOMETHING!! Then, the trio of fried things... Just gross. Oh the Caesar salad was decent, there you go. With delivery fees and tip it was $70 to just get angry. Never again."}
{"text":"We love this place and yet we have never been to the restaurant.  They are on Just-Eat.  We have tried their Meat Lovers Pizza (outstanding), the white clam sauce pasta (wow-  them's a lot of clams!), and a variety of the chicken pastas.  The food is always great -- the delivery has always been great. Meals come with a  small chef salad and garlic bread. Love the Italian dressing they use.  So order out or eat in -- check it out! Great prices for what you get!"}
{"text":"Walking in here was like walking into New York, there was even a Yankees Game on. We ordered a chicken Stromboli and spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were delicious and the portion size more than adequate for two servings. The Stromboli was large and delicious. It is family owned and operated. It lost a star for the price. Slightly expensive for what I would have preferred to pay. I plan on going back and ordering the garlic knots and maybe Calamari. My boyfriend really wants to try the pizza. It looks delicious."}
{"text":"This is some good Italian! A family owned business, the cook comes up with some pretty crazy concoctions, but they work. The food is so good and the price is amazing. For a large pizza it's $17.99, and their large is the size of most party sized pizzas at most establishments. And it's not a bad thing to say real fresh mozzarella here.  Had the Chicken Marsala recently and had to downgrade my rating, owner said it was the best, Id say not even close to edible."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from California and I was in desperate need to find a new favorite Italian restaurant. Well I found it !! There New York style pizza is the best!! There baked ziti is to die for!! This is my new favorite spot and I go multiple times during the month. Recommend 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"While the food was decent, the service had to be the worst we have ever had. It started out fairly well, but we did notice that we were never offered bread like the rest of the tables. When our appetizer came out we did not have plates. We spent 10 minutes trying to flag the server down. I finally gave up and went to the bar to ask for plates. When our food arrived mine was not brought out. It took another 10 minutes for her to come over and give a convoluted explanation of how she never put my food in, but she did write it down...which apparently makes everything better?? 20-25 minutes later my food finally arrived, but the rest of my family had already finished their meals. The server said she would be discounting the meal. When she finally brought the check, she took a whopping 10% off of my meal. I can say the busser/runner was very nice and came over to apologize and refill our drinks because our server had not provided refills. The worst part of it was they really were not that busy and all the other tables appeared to be well taken care of by their servers. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but whoa...that was just bad! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This review is for the pizza.  I love pizza, I am a pizza fan.  I like almost all pizza.  The pan pizza here was not good.  The crust tasted like a frozen pizza.  The cheese was sparely used.  My wife loved her entree, but I left disappointed.  The dessert earned La Famiglia Pizza & Pasta it's 2nd star.  It was good.  The prices were real high for a get your own drink establishment.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Very close to NY Pizza and the Rice Balls are the best I have ever had!!, EVER!! My advice is to order a plain Pizza or a plain Sicilian Pizza, they are both very NY and very delicious!! They also have Coke products :)"}
{"text":"This is the go to place for pizza for friends of ours. We've been invited over twice to have it with them. While they are just cheese people, I like some toppings on mine. Not a ton of them, maybe pep and mush, or sausage and mush, or sausage an onion, simple toppings. I'm not sure that even simple toppings can help this bland pie. So while in my quest to find a pizza out here that rivals my back home, small town pizza joint, I can cross this place off the list. I've not had other items on the menu, but I'll pass on the pizza."}
{"text":"I order a few things an price when up didn't say anything to me when i made my order by phone it was Jo an she has a sister Bonnie that work there she is no prize no phone skills  @ all if you call you maybe lucky they answer the phone on the 4 try should be by3 but when  They are talking to there family an friends they come first an then the customer that to me is poor service but that how there are There Farther is okay but he never answer the phone . He talk in Italian to his daughters even if you are waiting to pay an they are talking an i just want to pay an go. But it was over short in the draw ??. If you want prices they don't post them .. Why is that??? HMMMMMMM......??? . have have been to other pizza places an they post there prices .. Bouno's next door post there prices so you know what you pay up front  Not guess many other place do the same Mod pizza, clock worth an so many more. I will never go back there again an i will tell my friends an more word of mouth an e-mails .."}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by a few times and decided to try it out today. We both love pizza and Italian food and are always looking for someplace new to try.   We were seated promptly, and the waitress was very friendly. Looking over the menu, it was rife with misspellings, typos, and misuse of the noble apostrophe. I know it's a local place and sometimes that can fall through the cracks, it still looks unprofessional.   We ordered mozzarella sticks as an app, and they were brought out quickly. They were made well, crispy with no leaky cheese, but the breading was a little bland, and the red sauce they were served with was also a little bland, but it's tough to complain about fried cheese.  My husband ordered the meat lovers stromboli and thought it was pretty okay. I had a bite and thought the crust was pretty tasty, and they seem to use a good quality mozzarella, it came with the same red sauce the cheese sticks did.  I ordered the stuffed shells with Alfredo sauce. There was a dollar upcharge for the different sauce, but okay. The ricotta inside was under seasoned and over heated. Instead of creamy, the texture was grainy and separated, the worst kind of ricotta. I ate half of one of the three that were brought out. I was very disappointed.   The service was good, the place was clean, but the food wasn't that good, and a bit pricy for the not so great quality. I probably won't go back to try the pizza, and if I want Italian I'll go some place else."}
{"text":"Okay this place is awesome !   Some must try's ....... mind you we always do takeout ..   The rice balls !!!! Great job guys they rock and they are a great size !   The grandma pie .... epic it's the only place we know of that has grandma pie !  One of our fav specialty pizzas !!!!   The pepperoni rolls are great as well ... I accidentally ordered 2 orders of them but I'm glade I did because they all went !  We will have to dine in once to give a more informative yelp !!"}
{"text":"My wife had a baby today at Banner Desert Hospital and really wanted pizza.  I arrived at La Famiglia just after they had closed, but they made her the pizza anyway, and it was AWESOME.  Perfect crust, lots of great sausage, and it was done perfectly.  They have a customer for life!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay, I ordered the clam sauce fettuccine and it was good but there was WAY too much clam meat in it."}
{"text":"I brought my son and grandkids for lunch and we were very disappointed.  Said the outside wasn't open yet; it was 1PM...the pizza and Stromboli's were burnt!  I don't think I will be back; maybe the first two times I went was the flook and this is the for real."}
{"text":"I liked La Famiglia. Located in a somewhat dying strip mall corner, the night I spent at the restaurant was pretty busy. Our server was really great, offering order advice for those of us visiting for the first time. They are known for their strombolis, which looked huge and really delicious. I ordered the house lasagne and was not disappointed. They make homemade garlic bread, and do a great job keeping the basket full throughout the meal. They have a pretty decent kids menu, comprised mostly of Italian dishes. Our daughter liked their spaghetti, and the portion was very large.   I'm a big supporter of local businesses so I would recommend a visit to La Famiglia if you are in the mood for a great Italian meal at a nice, casual stop."}
{"text":"I was just there this evening and they sat me at table 9. We waited 20 mins before a waiter came to even acknowledge us. I asked for extra cheese and even that was something they couldn't get right. Needless to say, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Stopped by La Famiglia after a shopping trip at Frys when we first moved to this area.   Was having a hangover of epic proportions from celebrating at my friend's wedding ... And, as the story usually goes, I needed some food and water, stat.  We both got two slices of the cheese pizza and drinks.   Now, is this the best pizza in the area?   Absolutely not. But if you're in the area running errands (or struggling from the night before), this is a great place to grab a quick slice for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Outside of Little Italy in New York City, this is the most authentic Italian pasta place that you will find. It really is a Mom and Pop restaurant. One or more of the 3 generations of family members is always there. The meatballs are huge, dense, and flavorful but the Baked Ziti always has me coming back for more. The garlic knots with a side of their yummy, garlic infused Marinara sauce alone is worth the trip. Portions are huge, so we always have leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"OK - so I am a new fan of this place. I have driven by it MANY times and had always wanted to try it, but hey I was always on my way somewhere else... you know how it gets. BUT FINALLY gave it a try. The family was up for something new - so we gave it a shot.  So here is the first thing. We love pasta, about as much as pizza, so our first try was with the pastas. I had Lasagna - and loved it! Cooked well, lots of cheese and not afraid of meat. My kids had pastas - the test here is will they agree to have it again - and the answer was a resounding YES. As well as wanting to eat the leftovers that they could not finish. They Penne with meat sauce and Penne with Alfredo sauce and shrimp added. That was another thing - since they cook it when you order it that can make what you want within reason. So a Big thumbs up there. Last was my wife - and here was the real test with Chicken Marsala. That was a resounding yes - and became a new fav there.  Then the other day I stopped in to pick up our orders, I had no time for a dinner myself so I picked up a slice to have as I delivered the family's food. The owner (nice to MEET the owner vs the franchisee - if you get the idea there) suggested this AWESOME bacon ranch slice. WOW the earth moved! I gave half the slice to one of my kids as I dropped off the food. While I drove away, my child calls me and TELLS ME - we need to order a WHOLE pizza of that sometime soon. I NEVER hear my kids telling me to get food - I think they'd live on air, if they could. But when they like something - I hear about it. Let me tell you I heard about it.  If you are in the neighbourhood of this place - give it a try. It is a really good, family run, old style pizza parlour that makes good food. Everything we have tried so far... Now I am getting nostalgic...and hungry. Time to order. Chiao, bella (sp?)..."}
{"text":"Shout out to the lovely Christie S. who told me about this restaurant! La Famiglia serves up some of the best NY style pizzas I've had so far in AZ. In addition to pizza, they also offer Italian favorites such as pasta, stromboli, and impressive looking arancini.  I've been here a few times. The first time we had an 18\" \"The works\" pizza, signature thin crust style. When it came out it looked tantalizing and was a hefty sight to behold since it was such a large pizza. The toppings were plentiful and ingredients fresh. I liked the combination of flavors and the outer 1/3 of the pizza was the best, just like NY style with a lightly crisp crust but still pliable enough to fold. The inner 2/3 though was a little soggy and when I picked up my first slice my internal monologue was saying \"Nooooooooooo\" and like in a slow-mo disaster movie sequence, I saw the outer 2/3 of the toppings cascading off like a saucy Italian avalanche, falling into a sad little clumpy pile on the pizza pan. When I looked at my pizza, I was left with a mostly naked slice devoid of ingredients except for crust. I've also had a 16\" pizza where I've run into the same problem with partial pizza nudity, except only the inner 1/3 of the pizza toppings have fallen off.  The baked rice ball/arancini appetizer and grandma pizza are great choices on their menu. The rice balls are amazing (Amazeballs)! They are softball size with a crispy breaded outer coating and filled with ground meat, peas, and cheese. The baked version is smothered with marinara sauce and more cheese. Apparently they are made fresh every Thursday and are usually gone a few days later for good reason! The grandma pizza is delicious as well. It's a Sicilian thin crust pizza, rectangularly shaped, with plum tomatoes, mozzarella, and garlic. When we ordered it the crust was perfect throughout each slice and the flavors combined harmoniously with each other. I'd definitely get this pizza again!  Service was very sweet and friendly.   If we get another thin crust pizza we'd probably get something with less toppings on it to avoid any future R rated meals (haha). We've had nice experiences overall though and we'll definitely be back for more delicious pizza and arancini!"}
{"text":"Was craving a really good pizza today so, I decided to see which pizza places in and around Scarborough were highly rated by Yelp users. La Famiglia had really good ratings so I put through my order for a basic pepperoni - I like ordering online so I was pleased to find this option available. Now... If a place fails to deliver on a basic pepperoni pizza, they're blacklisted in my books. Got my order and from the first bite I was very impressed. A nice crispness to the bottom of the dough and the correct amount of cheese, tomato sauce and double pepperoni on top. The dough is not chewy at all and the crust is nice and lightly crispy, excellent for dipping sauces. This was an excellent pizza in my books and I certainly will be ordering from them again. If you're craving pizza give this place a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since they have a new location not far from us. According to the reviews and waiter, the pizza is amazing. We started with the appetizer, rice balls. These were pretty good. Loved the sauce! Wish I had bread to dip in the sauce. We split a pizza which to me was so bland. The crust was flavorless, couldn't taste the sauce and the cheese was not quality either. Apparently their liquor license isn't good yet so the bar was empty. The set up was kinda odd to me. Its like a split floor plan. Then there was a little bakery type cooler that was empty. Maybe they are still getting things together but you think they'd have a sign saying that, or your waiter/waitress would tell you? Our waiter was friendly but not good on keeping up with the refills.  There isn't much decor, kinda plain Jane like the food. Then we say the table next to us get fresh bread, hmmm not sure why we didn't get any. We may give it another try in time and skip the pizza, not sure."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by La Famiglia after viewing positive reviews on Yelp.  I'm glad I did.  Ordered the mild chicken wings and The Works pizza.  The wings were tasty and we'll cooked.  The pizza was so delicious.  The crust was great without being filling.  The toppings were good and the cheese had the right texture. The staff was very friendly.  I live in Markham but if I'm in the area and hungry, I will definitely drop by again."}
{"text":"Outstanding. The absolute best place for Italian food or specifically pizza. We moved to Sacramento and cannot find any place out here that compares. The baked ziti and garlic knots will not disappoint neither will the family that runs this joint. They are top notch."}
{"text":"Can't rave about this place enough. Think I have commented on them a few times before but they never disappoint. Every time we go they have awesome food, great happy hour prices and service with a smile. Pizza is #1, happy hour prices are great. They shrunk their calzones a tad  but they were so big before you could make 3 meals out of them. Now I can only make 2 meals out of them :) Have not tried the pasta yet but the wife raves on and on about it."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Costly but worth it. Quality is consistent.  They could improve their delivery and pickup speed."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp reviewers!!! La Famiglia as soon as you walk in coz that's how they make you feel. I wish i have found this place a little sooner. I ordered Lasagna for Easter and large pizza. Lasagna was excellent and meat sauce to perfection. But the pepperoni pizza, I would of eaten it all but of course I had to share with my familia. Not oily, lots pepperoni, dough is delicious. My go to place. And the people Ate super friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. It is family-owned and reminds me of the types of Italian restaurants I grew up with.  This place makes the best Stromboli's of all time. Their Italian dressing is homemade and is delicious.   Be sure to try their bone in wings, focaccia bread as well as the meatballs (also homemade).  This' a wonderful place as a regular restaurant, first date destination or any special occasion.  Check out Pasta Night every Monday."}
{"text":"My employer goes through this establishment to provide lunch for the office. Looks like I'll be taking a different option next time.  All I ordered was the Antipasto Salad. You've got to be kidding me. Throwing 4 old olives, some grated parmesan and 2 slices of a salami cold cut (cut into 4 pieces) is NOT a friggin' antipasto.  This is a joke. And I'm not easily turned away from restaurants.  Guess there's a first time for everything. Way to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Delicious & fresh.  Absolutely love the pizza and the pasta. Ordered the chicken Alfredo today and it was so yummy"}
{"text":"Have ordered exclusively for take-in Italian food from this place since November of last year after moving into the area. Having spent a considerable time in NYC I am a major pizza snob and will admit it. This place is on par in my experience with some of the better spots in Toronto and I have had some \"almost NYC\" level pizzas from them. Their hot sandwiches are always done perfectly, and the rolls they use are never off or hard. Great place."}
{"text":"I feel comfortable updating this review. I waited a few months to give them another opportunity. So tonight I try ordering a pizza for delivery and of course La Famiglia is apparently so busy that they refuse to take my order an hour prior to closing. I was told and I quote  \"any delivery order needs to be called in by 7:30 so they can catch up.\"  I have tried unsuccessfully to order food from this place THREE times. I have no choice but to  say **** this place and you're better off going somewhere else.  Will not return and can not recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to order - wing's, pizza, and deserts! They got it all, and great value."}
{"text":"New location, the service is a little slow.  I have given them time to get up to speed. Love the food, everything has been fantastic! Cut them some slack, they will get beer and wine this month!  I like because I can walk there!  LOL"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop in here as we frequent the area but had never stopped in. Man have we been missing out! The place is small and homey. We were greeted quickly and our server Isaias was awesome. The food that followed was no disappointment. We started with garlic knots that were a smoking deal for $2 happy hour. Easily the best garlic knots we have had. The focaccia bread was great as well. She had the shrimp scampi and I had the chicken fettucine alfredo. Both entrées were fantastic, the fettucine alfredo was the best I've had. Over all the place was a hit, great service and even better food. Thank you Isaias and La Famiglia, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate there today for lunch.  Service was very good, food was excellent.   Had a stromboli and it was delicious.   My daughter had a slice of pepperoni pizza and it was also very good.  Very nice addition to the neighborhood.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We moved to the valley from NY almost 7 years ago, we were luck enough to live around the corner from the old Warner location.  This is the ONLY pizza in the valley that I will go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"We have been here many times. We also have a dinner workshop here monthly. The food is excellent, great portions, awesome flavor and very pleasant service.  I love the Stromboli, spinach and ricotta with a side salad. The Chicken Parmesan is great too. The environment is pleasant and friendly too."}
{"text":"My son and I tried to stop in here for a slice but they would not let us in as My son was walking with his Dog Guide. Unsure how the food is but I will never order from them not even for delivery!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I moved in the area recently and have had their pizza four times now. Pizza slices are large and they are not shy with the toppings to say the least. You can tell that they care about the quality of their ingredients and how they make their food. This is my new go to place to for pizza. Truly a hidden gem"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at the original location and loved going. Great pizza and pasta and byob. Since they moved we have been in a couple of times and both times, most recently tonight, we have been disappointed. Food quality is not the same. Service is so so slow and unorganized. This time we got the wrong order, which they still charged for. And the wait to prepare the correct pasta was over 25 minutes. Not sure what has gone wrong but we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was great and prices were reasonable.  The atmosphere was lacking a little bit and it was kind of dead.  I assume this might have something to do with their recent relocation. Hopefully this place picks up soon and beefs up their decor."}
{"text":"When it comes to chandler az there are not very great choices for Italian food. This place is one step above average for the area. I have tried a few items on the menu, today I had the veal parm, very tasty but pricey (what do you expect from the veal?). Pizza is pretty good, its new york style and they have a full pasta menu. I say if you live or work in chandler its worth a look-see, but not worth a drive to check it out."}
{"text":"We did not like this place.  It was not busy at all when we went, and it still took awhile to be seated. While we were looking over our menus we overheard a server commenting on the pumpkin cheesecake being house-made and amazing.  It got my hopes up that everything else would have been house made as well.  I ordered the gnocchi, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. They both had the same sauce- which tasted like a can of tomato sauce with garlic powder and dried oregano sprinkled in before being served. Canned tomato products definitely have a distinct, awful taste so that was unfortunate.  The Gnocchi was stuffed with a spinach ricotta mix. They were kind of gummy, and were all extremely uniform.   The chicken was breaded with Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and was more soggy than crisp.  My boyfriend did like the bread they served before the entrees, it was like thickly rolled out pizza crust dough, brushed with butter and Italian seasonings, then cut into strips.  Our server poured a ton of oil and vinegar on a plate to go with it, I was surprised she used so much until I tasted it. It tastes like they either cut it with vegetable oil, or use an extremely low grade olive oil. The balsamic vinegar was very sweet and thin. On the plus side, their wine was reasonably priced. They seem to stock the mass produced brands that most people are familiar with."}
{"text":"Most important, Scooter Friendly! The owner used to have a Vespa back in the old country!  This is not a fancy place but clean, and the whole family works there. They are really nice. Pizza is NY / NJ style. Chicken Parm is great. Prices even better. Don't go here for white tablecloth meal. Go there for a great slice or Italian sandwich on good toasted bread. They have very very inexpensive lunch specials."}
{"text":"What can I say...this place is amazing! #1, Chloe the hostess is very helpful, kind, and patient. She remembered us on our 2nd visit. Our server Steve was awesome! Very knowledgeable on food options, helpful. Food...chicken Fracese is always a great dish! They are generous on sauce, chicken is great. Calzones? They are huge!! Calzones are equal in quality to East Coast (Connecticut, Jersey, the City). Cannolli is great (rivaling Boston North End) & carrot cake is amazing...is my new weekly weekend tradition!!"}
{"text":"Late night and hungry in an unknown place - Yelp to the rescue! :) This place came highly recommended, so we went in, ordered and got our take-out.   It's a small Italian place and most people seem to either order a delivery or come in for a take-out, cause I haven't seen any guests at the time we were waiting for our pizza. Maybe it's also cause it's local and not a part of a big shopping centre or something. It's family owned (or so we were told).  We ordered a small Cheese Steak Pizza and Garlic Knots. Pizza was huge (at least I thought so, I'm used to smaller \"small\" pizzas) and there were 4 big enough garlic knots in my box.   Pizza was thin crusted and had more than enough toppings. We weren't able to finish it at all. The garlic knots were made of pizza dough, but nicely twisted and sprinkled with olive oil and spices. Both dishes were good and I'm sure if we were from the area we'd order again when hungry."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had. You must try it. Toppings are crazy expensive ($2 per topping), but if you like just cheese, the price isn't too bad.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of an awkward experience I had the last time I picked up my pizza here. I was walking to my car with my pizza when the owner came out to my car and knocked on my window when I was about to leave. He said I was not holding the pizza flat enough when I was carrying it. What?! I was carrying it flat, maybe slightly tipping it to unlock my car. It was just really weird, who does that? Why does he care? And he wasn't very nice either. The owners are an Italian family that moved directly from NY. So they make good pizza, but not very nice. I honestly haven't been back since that experience, but I will probably just opt for delivery from now on."}
{"text":"We've visited several times but Friday we ordered delivery and as always is was fantastic!   I'm seriously addicted to their pizza crust.  It just tastes so good!  No cardboard here!  The toppings are always plentiful and great quality.    Meatball sub was to die for and the calzones are straight from heaven!  Loaded with melted cheesy goodness!    This is our go to for pizza!  A little pricey but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I believe I've said this before but I'll say it again.  I'm not a fan of Italian food, but La Famiglia Pizza & Pasta restaurant does a really great job at making me one.   I like calzone's and theirs didn't disappoint.  The mozzarella and ricotta cheese was wonderfully stuffed inside the pizza dough.  The small one is HUGE!  I like the fact that they put the sauce on the side and not inside.  The pizza sauce is not overly spicy for me and has a sweet taste, which in my world makes it really yummy.  Tonight we visited them again and and I tried the stuff shells.  I took a- long my son-in-law, daughter. two grandchildren and my husband. Everyone loved what they ordered.   I tried my husbands baked ziti and I will definitely add that to my list of must tries.    The owners make everyone feel like family and I think this place is worth a visit even if you don't like Italian food."}
{"text":"Very good place with super welcoming staff, like a family as the name suggests. I had two pizza slices, very nice dough unlike chainstore ones. Very happy will be back!"}
{"text":"I placed a big order for a birthday party despite never having tried their pizza before and I wasn't disappointed!  I asked to have it delivered 10 min before they even opened. They kindly agreed and were on time so the roomful of kids were happy. Everyone loved the pizza, adults too!  The Meat Lovers and Mediterranean were big hits!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes!  The pizza has high quality ingredients, great variety, friendly service, and delivery, if you're in the area.  I have tried three different pizzas, and wings and have yet to be disappointed!  Thin crust, but flexible, like Manhattan style pizza.  My go-to place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first and last time last night. My husband had chicken marsala and the chicken was so tough you could hardly cut it. My son had fettuccine Alfredo and it was so bland. No flavor at all! My other 2 sons and I shared a pizza. Very greasy and the crust was very hard, maybe overcooked but not sure. Anyways $65 later and we didn't enjoy one thing!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The owners are so warm and welcoming. The cannoli cake rocks. Great pizza."}
{"text":"This is a review that I am sad to write. I love their food but placing an order over the phone is impossible! I have called 4 times in the last week and each time I have been immediately placed on hold. Doesn't matter what time of day it is - expect to be put on hold. The first 3 times, I waited for over 5 min before hanging up and taking my business elsewhere (Sal's Gilbert Pizza). Today was the last time. Even though you are less than 2 miles from my house, I will going into Gilbert to get my pizza from now on.  Also - Monday pasta night... WHY is the spaghetti with meatballs MORE money on pasta night than on your regular menu?"}
{"text":"Recently started ordering their pastas. Yum. So good and big portions.  Really great food!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I loved the atmosphere--it reminded me of some of my favorite Jersey Shore family restaurants.  The cheese pizza arrived crisp (as ordered) and dripped a little of the essential orange grease.  Yum.  The cheese calzone was fabulous and the marinara for dipping perfectly prepared.  Cheese coma.  Bliss.   The owners were hosting a party for their grandchild but still took the time to check in with us to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast, which means I'm naturally picky about my pizza and Italian food. La Famiglia has the most authentic, amazing pizza! I judge a place by its cheese pizza because there are no toppings to hide behind, and this cheese pizza is to die for. They have that thin delicious center with a chewy and flavorful crust. Their cheesesteaks are also east coast style and impeccable. If you're wanting some authentic east coast style Italian pizza and cuisine, look no further! I don't know if I'll order pizza from anywhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable pizza!  I called in to order a Chicken Parmesan pizza and they had it ready in the 15min that they promised!  When I got there it was ready, so I picked it up.  This restaurant is a small mom and pops place so there isn't much space but there are a few small tables to eat at.  I took the pizza home to share.  The pizza tasted really good!  I'd be sure to get pizza from La Famiglia when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Nice people, just dumb business practice. Feel bad for business but they made the choice. I canceled my $300-$400 catering order because they can't mix meatballs and pasta. \"Not their protocol\" the girl said. Just stupid, dumb business practice."}
{"text":"\"Life is a combination of magic and pasta.\"  ? Federico Fellini  What a treat to have this so close to home We ordered a Baked Rice Ball, an Antipasto Salad, and a Lasagna Pizza. Oh yes!   The baked rice ball was soooooo delicious. Who doesn't love a good arancini? They top these baked heavenly treats with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella. It's a humungous hunk of a thing and served cut in half. The antipasto salad included lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, salami, provolone, pepperoni, onion, and kalamata olives. They package the dressing on the side so you can add as little or as much as you want. It was a standard salad for the most part and we mainly ordered it so we can get some vegetables with our meal. As for the Lasagna Pizza, oh my! It had meatballs, giant dollops of ricotta,? mozzarella cheese, and of course pizza sauce. We got the 14\" which was more than generous for two people. We had to take half the pizza home even!  The crust was perfect and the toppings were plentiful. All in all, I really enjoyed our meal.  With La Famiglia so close to home, I'm sure we will stop by often. The menu is extensive and impressive. I want to come back and get that Grandma Pizza and more arancini!"}
{"text":"Imagine my surprise, when i found an authentic NY Italian restaurant in Chandler. If your from back east and miss that great food, or if you've never been and are looking for authentic Italian... this is the place. The pizza's are great as are the entrees,   everytime i walk into the place, it makes me yearn for home !!!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was great. I had a mushroom and meatball calzone with Ricotta and Moz. It was out of this world! We even kept taking nibbles of the kids' pizza slices. Oh, and those pizza slices!? Holy huge! I'm so glad we finally tried this place out. It's a very nice, affordable family oriented establishment."}
{"text":"Loved the calzone, the ricotta cheese made the difference to me! The service was prompt and they were able to keep up with my family of 6!"}
{"text":"My go to place for catering dinner when I am not up for cooking. Josephine did a fab job suggesting what to serve my 10 dinner guests. My husband picked up the order and was assured by the owner that everything was wrapped tightly to stay warm. It was! Guests ate up the chicken parmesan, alfredo and sausage and peppers. Don't forget to add in a dozen garlic rolls...or more."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time and their wings were amazing. Everyone around me was raving about their favorites from the menu too. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews are people complaining about wait times and service. If you want your food fast, go to Taco Bell. If you want your a$$ kissed, go to a snobby $75/plate place in Scottsdale. If you want great food and beer at a good price, this is your place."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bite of their meat lovers Pizza wow it's incredible. I'm not a big pizza fan even though my wife is Italian. Somebody here was bragging about the Grandma's Pizza. I'm not sure if I'm up to the challenge because I like the meat lovers"}
{"text":"We went to the new location for the first time for dinner.  Hope tonites service isn't typical, because it was awful.  Food was decent. and out waiter was nice but really slow.  Also we ordered the rice ball. which was listed as coming with sauce and cheese.  When it came to the table it had meat in it.  Just a heads up to any vegetarians which come to this restaurant,   confirm the dish doesn't have meat in it."}
{"text":"They owned a pizza place and an Italian bakery in Long island NY for many years. I grew up right down the street. I had no idea they were here until last year. We have always had great service and food here. We are treated as the restaurant name says; like family. The new location is very nice. Their pizza is one of the better NY style pizzas in the valley, which is sorely lacking in this department. I would go more often but I do not live in the East Valley.  I cherish the NY gatherings we have here though when we all get together."}
{"text":"Love it. Owners are from West Babylon, NY. They had a pizza shop and Italian bakery in Islip Terrace NY right down the street from where I grew up. I could not believe they lived here for so long and I was unaware. Garlic Knots are great and the pizza is good NY style. The family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from East Islip. Uncle Joe is such a nice man. The entire evening was just delightful. I am happy to discover this little gem of a place and I will be back. Happy to say they opened a Beall's outlet right next door too so I can shop and eat. Well, at least until they move to their new location."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, good pizza, and ice cold beer.  Staff was attentive and very friendly. Great place to come have dinner/beer after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"If you are from the tri-state area and  you believe the previous posts that this is authentic NY style pizza, you will be disappointed.  I have had much better pizza in the area, yet nothing comes too close to the real deal, so i keep trying new places.  This is not a winner."}
