{"text":"Out of convenience while staying at the Wekopa hotel, my wife and I dined at the Ahnala Mesquite Room thinking it a risk based on some negative Yelp reviews.  My wife had the Halibut and I had the Filet Mignon we both found our meals delicious, flavorful with a flair, and served hot!   The artisanal dinner rolls were piping hot and we particularly enjoyed the seeded rolls.  My Filet was well seasoned and covered with blue cheese crumbles that I crave.  The hollandaise sauce for the Filet and asparagus was a nice addition.  If you are nearby, take a risk but know that our gamble paid out a jackpot of a meal."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have been to. We had dinner here on Saturday night and it was very disappointing. We started with chips and salsa, the chips very very stale, but we understand that they come out of a bag, no big deal. For the entrée I had the scallops and my fiancé had the ribeye.  I am gluten intolerant so it was nice to see that the menu had a note about asking your server for gluten free/vegetarian/allergen information. So I asked my server if the scallops and risotto are gluten free. She didn't seam very confident about knowing if gluten was in the dish but she went to the kitchen and came back saying it was gluten free. 

Guess what?! It wasn't, I was sick all night after eating my meal. It tasted okay but the scallops seamed like the texture was from frozen (fine we are in Arizona) but the cheese sauce with the risotto tasted like valveeta. The ribeye was pretty pathetic for a 32$ steak too. 

For a 4 star resort and a 90$ meal I would expect staff to be trained on allergies and have better quality food."}
{"text":"Dinner was abysmal. Took 20 minutes to even take our drink order, another 15 for appetizers to begin arriving (they were all clearly prepared way ahead of time, salad was wilted and warm, so why did it take so long to get them to the table? The restaurant was only half full, never even close to busy). Food took 1.5 hours to arrive, and was cold when it came out. Other guests at nearby tables had similar experience. No attempt at an apology was made, had to seek out a manager who agreed to not charge us for the food we waited 90 minutes for and did not eat."}
{"text":"We needed a Paleo meal and hoped we could find a good steak before traveling up the mountain. We were not disappointed. Our initial contact with the hostess was slow, but the steak and service were good."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great, service was what is expected.  I had hopes for something more spectacular for the price but overall not bad."}
{"text":"Best place for food and great price. I had a salmon club sandwich for dinner and coconut princess cake for dessert very good for the price.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Place was empty on a Thursday night.  Wait staff was very friendly, attentive, but not terribly polished.  Cocktails were good.  We shared an entree salad (chopped chicken) and beef filet dinner.  Filet came with so-so risotto.  We were glad we ordered a side of the hablano  risotto which was the star of the evening.  Will be looking else where for dinner for the rest of the weekend."}
{"text":"The food was not good.  I mentioned that to the manager and he became rude, very rude.  I wouldn't let my dog eat there.  Sorry, but I can't tell how rude that guy was.  Good luck if you eat there.  My bill was a healthy 300 dollars."}
{"text":"Our server Henry was great, however the manager was unprofessional and disrespectful since she decided to scold an employee in the dining room. Also instead of assisting her staff she choose to chat with the hostess and ignore all operations. Food was good, but huge turn off on how it runs"}
{"text":"The waitress seemed to think it was an inconvenience that myself, and a friend, were seated in her station, and inconvenienced her by having to wait on us. When asked questions, or asked for service, she was rude. Her name was Stephanie. I found out that there is a 20% gratituty automatically added to the tab, so that explains that the wait staff really doesn't have to work for a tip. They don't care if they give good service. I read other reviews and the attitude of the staff seem to be a problem."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, very  accommodating.  Food was not anything special.  I had the burger ordered medium and it arrived well.  Also looked like a premade frozen patty.  My dad had the club sandwich which he said was pretty good, it was huge.  Convenient place when we didn't want to get back out after arriving at the resort."}
{"text":"I ate here 4 times while staying at Wekopa Resort (it's cheaper than room service). I thought the happy hour menu was awesome, really good food and drinks at good prices. Almost everything on the happy hour menu is $4-6. I tried the El Barco, Ahnala burger, wine, calamari and basically everything else on the happy hour menu. My favorite item was a steak avocado salad from the dinner menu. It was $10 and had a ton of meat and avocado. The pineapple cake and burger w/fries were really good, too. 

Courtney was a great server, she helped me for two meals and she deserves 5 stars. She was always checking on me and my pup and she was friendly, too. They turned on the patio heaters for my dog and I and Courtney even turned on a hockey game I requested on the big screen. :)

Minus one star because the other servers working during weekend breakfast were not attentive enough. It was difficult to get their attention for simple requests like coffee cream or water.

Overall I'd say this place is a great choice for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"We tried to have breakfast here Sunday morning. We waited for 10 minutes at the hostess stand and could not get attention from anyone. They had very few customers yet unable to seat us or the other people waiting.  We went into the casino and had breakfast at Cafe 87. Vet friendly staff and great prices!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here only because all the places at the casino had a two hour wait. We got seated quickly and our waitress took our order and mentioned that she will very much keep our water filled. Never seem her again and had to beg for water. Got our corn bread and soup which was really good but waited 45 mins for our salads. The couple next to us got their meal in 15 mins.  Our Salads were drenched in salad dressing and tasted horrible. We ate only a 1/4 of our meal because we were very hungry otherwise we would have sent them back and we didn't want to wait another 45 mins. For $10 salad it sure was gross. The wait staff was running around like they were short staffed. There was probably only less the twenty people. Very unorganized mess watching them hussle about with oversized heavy dishes with small food items on each.  It took two people to carry entries out for a table of two."}
{"text":"A large national group to which I belong recently stayed at the Radisson where this restaurant resides.   I personally stayed at the hotel for three nights.   During the first evening, a group of 6-8 of us decided to dine in this restaurant.   There were parts of our overall dining experience that were quite good--the bruschetta (as it was unusual--in a good way--from the typical that is normally served).   Most people at our table enjoyed there meals.   I am not one to really complain and really try to look at the bright side of all situations.  This dining experience, for me, was entirely different.   My dining experience was one-star at best.  I gave two stars to be fair to the establishment and the wait person as others did enjoy most of their meals.   Regarding my starter--I think I've had milk that was thicker in consistency than the watered-down, no taste, butternut squash soup.   For my main course, I ordered a cobb salad as it was late and I didn't want a terribly heavy meal. I waited....waited....and waited some more to the point where everyone had not only finished their main courses, but were embarrassed that I didn't have mine.  Clearly, the wait person did not place the order for this salad.  The story we heard was that the hard boiled egg on the \"first\" salad they prepared for me was overdone.   The salad that did arrive had a hard boiled egg that was absolutely runny--as if I was eating a sunnyside-up egg at breakfast.   I can tell you that it's the first time I've ever seen that served on a cobb salad.  To make a longer story short, there wasn't an apology nor any offer to make the situation right by the customer.  Instead, I received my bill and paid the full price.  I am thinking that I will never go back."}
{"text":"We read the reviews on this restaurant prior to going and had a great experience at both dinner on Friday night and again, for the breakfast the next morning. On Friday, there was plenty of wait staff, ours was really friendly and quick even when the she got busy. We had the special and the mango chicken sandwich and it was all very tasty. The prices were average teens and that seems normal. On Saturday late morning we went for the breakfast, which there was menu option and buffet option. We opted to split breakfast since we had to go meet others for lunch. We split the juevos rancheros and let them know we were sharing and they brought it out already separated for us. It was my first juevos rancheros, and it was amazing! I was sad I had to split it with my husband but it was also just the right amount of starter for us. The waitress this day was a little slower but we didn't mind it. We enjoyed both meals, the atmosphere and the views."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat at tha Ahnala, since we were staying right next door at the Radisson resort. We ordered the New York steak & it was legit. Disregarding the fact that I ordered my steak medium well & instead I got it well done. Our waiter was nice, good attitude. When we received the bill I tipped the waiter a pretty decent amount. The next day (today) I checked my bank account online as a normal routine finding out that the tip I gave was doubled without my consent!!!! I contacted the restaurant immediately!!!! The manager Amy answered the phone. I explained to Amy my concern and all I got from her was an attitude. She was very unprofessional and disrespectful. I had to escalate the issue to a higher management, since Amy (the manager\") was unhelpful and unwilling to assist with the issue. Still the issue is unresolved and I'm suppose to get a call back tomorrow. We shall see how this turns out. Never again will I dine here!!! These people are fraudulent and rude. And if you do dine here then I advise you to use cash because they will do some fraudulent stuff without your consent. If I could give them no stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Horrible.   Worst dining experience we have had.   Went for valentine dinner.   It took an hour for appetizers and another half hour to get up and leave.   Our entree never appeared.   The soup was cold.   No drinks or any waitstaff apologized or checked on us.   Do not waste your money or time! The restaurant was only half full on top of that."}
{"text":"The food is good, I had a refreshing Cobb Salad, and it should be because there is no where else to eat that is near, especially after a few glasses of wine.  

Every time I've been here I feel like they don't expect a rush and the wait for service is irritating.  Luckily the service is friendly but next time I'll skip that second glass of wine and drive into Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Ate here two nights in a row as I was staying at the hotel with a business group.  While a little understaffed service was friendly and beyond efficient.  The menu was enjoyed by all and I can whole hartedly recommend.  Ask for the bar menu to have even more choices."}
{"text":"Average. Nothing to write home about. 
Burgers are stamped out, I was expecting better."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise.  I was staying in the hotel next door for about a week.  Ahnala was my de facto kitchen for most of my meals that week.

I really liked the service.  Sean was my waiter several times.  The staff seemed to get to know me and my quirks, and they always treated me very well.  I substituted broccolini for risotto many times just because I shouldn't be eating so many carbs.  It seemed like many of their dishes had some kind of risotto.  I just had to substitute some vegetable for the risotto.  They never gave me a problem with it.  In fact, Sean even said that my \"way\" looked better than the way the dishes were supposed to come out.

Anyway, I had great service.  I had better food than I expected.  I had some really nice salads, some really nice scallops, and some really nice steaks.  Breakfast wasn't bad either.  I just usually needed breakfast earlier than they were serving.  So, I got in my rental car and took care of that on my own."}
{"text":"Nice décor, decent service, OK food, Good prices for a resort 
 
Service. 

* Waitress was very nice, but obviously new as she did not seem to know a lot about the menu.

Food. 

* Wife had the Ahnala Burger ($10 & 3 Stars) and reported it was OK but not remarkable - it would have been better if the bun was not cold. Accompanying steak fries were great! 

* I had the Ahnala Chicken with Garden Risotto ($14 & 3 Stars): the chicken had lingered on the grill a tad too long, and the risotto was just OK. 

* The highlight of the meal was the desert! Cheesecake chimi with cinnamon, whipped cream & jalapeno vanilla ice cream ($7 & 5 Stars) - absolutely fabulous - trust me on this, we rarely order desert, but the waitress raved about it, and OK we had a free coupon!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Salmon and quinoa salad. Totally recommend. We sat up at the bar and the bartender Tammy was super friendly and accommodating. Recommend !"}
{"text":"This is ridiculous !!! I traveled all over the world and never paid $7 dollars for a cup of coffee !!!
This is reap off !!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today waiting on a spa appt.  got the bacon, guacamole grilled cheese.  It was pretty good, but nothing special. I think  I would prefer straight avocado than guacamole on the sandwich Pleasant atmosphere, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ahnala Mesquite Room is the house restaurant at the We-Ko-Pa Resort Hotel. You won't actually find it in the hotel, but inside the Conference Center building.

The big main dining room has a hardwood floor and pastel colors for the furniture plus Indian prints for accent here and there.

My lunch was a Cabo Salad with Shrimp https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ahnala-mesquite-room-fort-mcdowell?select=w5cgHOurJtj4zTcweJa1fw for $14.95. Go take a look at it, I thought it was one of the most gorgeous plates I've ever had served to me. Strawberries, raspberries, cubed watermelon, blueberries, cheese and grilled shrimp over a bed of greens. 

The fruit was perfect -especially the watermelon. Too bad I wasn't a fan of the three grilled shrimps- they were overcooked and dry.

My glass of Passionfruit Iced Tea ($4), recommended by our wonderful server Ann Marie was very good.

Lunch for four (two entrée salads, two Buffalo Mozzarella plates, two soft drinks and two of those teas) ran us $70.63."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Great presentation and flavor. The portions are huge!  The wait staff has been here for years and may have lost a bit of their zeal for greeting new arrivals. I love their accent though. We had great service once we were seated. Price is a bit high but you ARE at a resort in the middle of almost nowhere! We have come to We-ko-pa resort for three years now and the food is one of the things we appreciate most here!"}
{"text":"Summary: warm greeting, excellent service, adequate wine list, good food. Nice night; we'll be back.

Agree with recent Yelper - Sean does a great job. Good balance of casual, friendly and professional service. 

Restaurant has a clean, very contemporary although slightly stark design. It's slightly loud in the dining room, owing to the design I think as there weren't many people there yet. 

Started with cactus quesadillas - very tasty. Served with a cactus crème fraîche, interesting but a bit sweet.

She had the NY strip. Was cooked perfectly to order and we both agreed was very flavorful, although we've had slightly more tender renditions (to be fair, our go-to steak is a ribeye).

I had the duck, also cooked exactly to order. Duck came with leek crepes as the starch; interesting. The duck was very good, could have been killer with a more substantial sauce. 

Had the \"Ahnala Pie\" for dessert, thick chocolate crumb crust, topped with a layer of chocolate then coffee gelato, drizzled with caramel, very nicely presented. Some of these types of desserts can be intolerable sugar bombs; this one, although sweet, was worth the calories. 

All about $120 incl tip and $30 of wine. I was satisfied with the value. 

Happy to have eaten here. We've put Ahnala on our list of only 2-3 \"nice\" restaurants in Fountain Hills (a very tough market since 1/3 of the locals pack up and leave for half the year, and it's too far for most to drive from the valley)."}
{"text":"I have to admit, this place surprised me.  My expectations were very low when we walked by and noticed this restaurant.  It's out of the way, located between the Ft McDowell casino and the Radisson Hotel next door.  If we hadn't parked in the far back parking lot, we would've never stumbled across this place.

After browsing the menu, we decided to give it a shot for dinner.  We ordered the following items:

Risotto Duet (Habeñero Orange, Poblano Vanilla), $7
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ahnala-mesquite-room-fort-mcdowell?select=KyaOVkefz0hPTrYcERTbCA#KyaOVkefz0hPTrYcERTbCA

Cactus Quesadilla, $7

Filet (Crispy Shallots, Sherry Risotto, Sautéed Broccolini, Tomato Jam, Red Wine), $38

The Risotto Duet was outstanding!  I've never had Risotto with Habanero Orange and Poblano Vanilla flavors before....very tasty and unique.  It's a large portion, even for 2 people.  We didn't realize that when we ordered and also ordered a Cactus Quesadilla for an appetizer.  That was very good too.  Unfortunately, we were stuffed by then and I already ordered the Filet....otherwise, I would've passed on an entree.

The Filet came out and I ended up splitting it with The Better Half.  We were both pretty full, so we only ate 1/2 of it.  It was very good though and I would order it again.

The service here was good, I wouldn't say excellent.  I'll come back.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Staff could use more training. I feel so bad I don't even know where to start. I feel like we inconvenience them. Very unaware. Customers come first before you clean around us, before you tend to a ringing phone. Handle who is in your face first. Ask if anyone is watching the TV before turning it off. Gosh I feel like a whinny itch. Food was good. Staff were obviously in a hurry to get off. They're making me sober on a Saturday!! Gosh relax. Sincerely, loyal Phoenician"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly. The design of the restaurant was nice but the holiday decor was pretty tacky. We each had cheesecake. It was good.
The place was pretty empty except a few people at the bar & 2 other tables."}
{"text":"If you are there during happy hour (3-6pm I think), be sure to ask for the happy hour menu. Otherwise they just give you their regular menu. I guess they don't want people to know about the specials? 

I had the Fry Bread ($8) and Shrimp Ceviche ($8) off of the happy hour menu along with a Sangria. Ryan had the Ahnala Burger ($12) with sweet potato fries.

Everything was delicious! The fry bread was topped with cheese, chipotle aioli and some pico--just the right portion. The Shrimp Ceviche was served with two plantain chips that worked really well as dippers. I wish there was more than 2. Not a big deal, I ended up scooping up the rest of the ceviche with my fry bread!

I had a bite of Ryan's burger and fries--no complaints there either! Beef was really juicy and seasoned well.

All in all, a great meal!"}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise! Not great reviews on yelp, but we were staying at the resort and decided to give it a try. 

Our waitress was attentive, but not intrusive. She was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. 

And now to the food....we got the Saturday night prime rib special. It started with warm tasty rolls and room temperature spreadable butter. A Caesar salad came next. Pretty run of the mill. Dressing on the side, lettuce, cheese, croutons and some sun dried tomatoes. But now onto the main course. Baked potato with all the condiments you would need to elevate it from just a baked potato. The grilled vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the prime rib.....perfect! Soft, flavorful and well seasoned. We will come back just for the meat again and again!

To top it off, our waitress happened to ask us if we were celebrating something. When we said yes, our anniversary, she brought out the dessert menu and told us to choose something on the house. We ended our meal with the tuxedo, chocolate mouse covered in chocolate ganache.

Impressive meal, and great service at a great price!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for an overnight with the wife and had dinner here. 

-Great food (I had the Monterey Chicken Sandwich)

-Server and host were kind

-nice atmosphere on the patio

The only awkward thing was a stray dog kept on coming on to the patio to beg for food. The staff tried to encourage it away, but it kept on coming back. 

If you stay here but don't want to eat in the casino, this is your only option unless you drive into fountain hills (10 minutes or so away). The hotel does have a shuttle, I believe though."}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast while attending a conference. The waitstaff tries to be prompt and friendly and also are wearing the same Radisson uniform as the front desk agents!

Eggs Benedict - $12
- They put some type of spice which gave the dish a slight kick
- Eggs were poached perfectly and the pork cake? was slightly dry

I also ate the two eggs w/ sausage special the other day and I had a complimentary piece of hair on my plate.... My coworker was also lucky to have her breakfast as the waiter spilled the food all over himself and the floor! 

...To top it off, they left the food there! ....yup! sitting on the carpet! yum yum!"}
{"text":"It's too bad the food and service at this place are substandard. We stayed at the resort for a staycation. The facilities are great. I recommend staying away from Ahnala!!! If you want food, just order room service or order something from the poolside lounge. You will be more satisfied!!"}
{"text":"You don't have many choices at the Resort but this place has solid food and a great staff. Maybe the staff has changed since the other reviews but they were great for us."}
{"text":"I wish I had heeded the previous reviews about this restaurant. Last night, we ordered the ahi and a Waldorf salad and it came out like it was prepackaged out of the box. It did not have any flavor and the accompanying asparagus was overcooked. The Waldorf salad was uninspired. The entire time you are in the restaurant, you feel like you're in an airport lounge.... Only with worse food in the airport lounge. We sent the not-fresh tuna back, and our server does not charge. Save your money and have a nice dinner in Fountain Hills or perhaps go to the Buffet."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!!

I have been at this restaurant a few times now for a sit down dinner and more, each time was because my work was checking out the venue to hold our annual conference at the resort, which we ended up doing.

The very first time we ate here, the place was empty, granted, we were a party of about 8 or 9 people, but considering we were the only 8 or 9 people, the service should not have taken as long as it did, and been as unfriendly as it was.

The second time I was here, was again with co-workers, we had finished discussing the details of our conference with the resort staff. Again, we were greeted with unfriendly service, and it took forever to order and get our food with a fairly empty restaurant.

The third time was when we were actually setting up for our conference and decided to get dinner here after a long day of setup. This time we were greeted with a very unfriendly hostess, who couldn't even force out a smirk, after standing around for a while. Then once we sat down, we waited longer for someone to even come around and say hello or take a drink order. This time we decided to just walk out.

Due to these interactions with this restaurant, and similar with other coworkers. My company decided to ask the restaurant to provide our conference guest with breakfast buffets as to not have to deal with their wait staff and service.

The reason I did give them 2 stars however, is because they did do a great job with the breakfast buffet, from my experience anyways."}
{"text":"The Ahnala Mesquite Room is a small but very nice restaurant located at the Radisson Fort McDowell Resort. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner including a variety of southwest inspired dishes. During our stay at the hotel we ate at the Ahnala for dinner and breakfast. The ambiance at the restaurant was great with subdued and interesting lighting and modern furnishings and decorations with a southwest twist. They even have a small fireplace. With only a few busy tables at dinner the restaurant was a little noisy, so it may not be good for a quiet dinner or for much conversation, but it was still a pleasant setting for dinner. The restaurant also features a full bar with some great mixed drink options including speciality drinks the Ponderosa and The Yucca. 

For dinner I ordered the pork chop with rice and beans and chips and salsa to start. When I ordered the waitress asked me how I wanted my pork cooked which I thought was really unusual. She explained that with their cut of pork you could ordered it cooked like you would have a steak cooked. So I asked for medium well. None to surprising when my pork chop showed up I cut into it and it looked gross. The whole inside was uncooked and that is NOT my kind of pork chop. I asked the waitress to send it back and they returned it better cooked. Later on I asked the manager about their pork and got the same weird answer about their cut of pork. Perhaps I am just uneducated but that was really strange. From my experiencing grilling pork chops its either cooked or its not. You can't cook pork like you can steak, it doesn't work. Oh well. In the end the pork chop was decent, not outstanding but good enough with a nice flavor. The rice and beans were a lousy side dish though and had little if any flavor. Overall dinner was pretty good, not great, but not bad either. The prices were a little expensive though, my chop with rice and beans was $24. So value wise I don't feel like I got much for my money.

The next day we ate breakfast at Ahnala and had a pretty good meal. I ordered my usual: two eggs over easy with potatoes, bacon, and toast. The eggs were fine, not very warm but good tasting nonetheless. The cubed potato hashbrowns were nothing special and had very little flavor. The bacon was kind of oily. The toast was a good sour dough bread and they had some good jams and marmalade. For two breakfast was over $30 and close to $40 with tip which I'm not sure was worth it. Again I don't know if they deliver the kind of value I expect given the prices charged...

Overall the Ahnala Mesquite Room has a lot going for it but their prices are expensive and their food doesn't warrant the cost in my opinion. GIven the lack of options around the Radisson I think they are a decent choice for a meal, but not a great choice unfortunately. If I stayed here again I would probably take the time to drive into town and find a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality of the restaurant. Applebee's level of ambience, service, and food. But the entrees were $25-40 each."}
{"text":"Sean is an AMAZING server, and Charlie is one of the best chefs I've ever had the privilege to experience. Try his RARE filet... oh, and if you don't partake in a slice of the Ahnala Pie then you honestly haven't lived."}
{"text":"I had the Alaskan Halibut which came with Habenero orange risotto, and sautéed broccolini and carrots.  It was pretty good, but maybe a tad overcooked. The fish and veggies were super hot, which may have cut into the flavor of some of the veggies.  The cut of the fish was nice though and the habanero sauce was great on the fish and on the risotto."}
