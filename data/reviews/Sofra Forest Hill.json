{"text":"Since Sofra open their new location in the Forest Hill village, Mashu Mashu lose a lot of their customers. It's that good! Love their baba ganoush, laffa bread, steak and chiken dinner plates, as well as Greek salad."}
{"text":"Wow.
For 45$ (no booze) we had an amazing dinner with one app. The Morrocan cigars app is crazy good.
The lamb Kefta kebob dinner was huge and very, very tasty
The falafel dinner was fantastic
Love this place."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Sofra, the new Mediterranean place in my neighborhood.  I ordered the falafel dinner ($15+ with tax), and sadly I was very disappointed. 

The falafel were spongey and oil-filled, and the garlic potatoes didn't have any flavour and were shriveled. They did give a nice green salad, but the dressing was gelatinous and unflavourful. I was expecting much more from a $15 vegetarian meal--especially since the restaurant is a direct competition to another very close Mediterranean restaurant that makes excellent falafel."}

{"text":"Food is good and consistent but the staff are terrible at takeout orders and customer service. It's really a shame because it makes the dining and takeout experience terrible. Most recently they messed up my takeout order even though l went over it multiple times on the phone. Food was not ready at the time promised. Had to wait for a while while they prepared my food and got things wrong. When I asked about missing items in my order the woman at the counter didn't even apologize for the mistakes. She seemed annoyed that I was asking for her food I had already bought but she missed. I will not go back to eat or get takeout at Sofra and do not recommend it. Even though we like the food, being treated so rudely is not worth paying for."}
{"text":"Decent meal...didn't have too high expectations about this place. Ordered the hummus (mediocre) and the chicken skewer combo which surprisingly tasty! The service was okay...and the food was pretty well priced (20-25 range). If you are hungry, make sure to get the combo because you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"We order delivery from here all the time and it's consistently fresh, fast, and delicious. We typically order two meals for two people but the portions are huge so there are always leftovers. I've only had the chicken (schnitzel and kabob) meals but can't see anything being bad. The salad dressing for the garden and Greek salad is out of this world. Also really into the potatoes, hummus, and laffa. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Sofra Grill over at St. Clair and Dufferin for a while and love it, just noticed this one opened up, so it was natural I'd give it a shot. I'm not sure if the two are related to each other or not, but the menu is very similar, so they must be.

Ordered ahead by phone to pick up and take away and arrived needing to use the bathroom. Very impressed with the bathroom, very clean and brand-new.

Anyway, ordered a chicken breast shish kebab sandwich to go and the thing was enormous! Very tasty chicken, nice fresh toppings and it was enveloped in Laffa bread which was nice and chewy and tender. 

Very satisfied with the experience and am looking to try more sandwiches on pita bread like chicken dark meat, lamb and beef shish kebab. 

Price was under $10, even cheaper with pita bread rather than laffa bread.

I can see myself going here regularly, especially during summertime."}
