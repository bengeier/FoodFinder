{"text":"I usually love Hero Burgers so I was very excited to see that there was one when I was going to  meeting at King and Bathurst. I ordered my favourite, a turkey burger. Never had any problems. This is a new franchise and the staff seemed very disengaged. My burger came and I took a few bites and looked down at it and realized it was raw in the center! Being 13 weeks pregnant I was disgusted and upset even more. I walked up to an employee and brought him my burger and he commented that is how their turkey looks but he will make me a new one. I know what raw turkey looks like and he was just afraid the pregnant lady was going to go ballistic. He offered to make me a new one which I had no time to eat as I had to run to my meeting. So there is a waste of $12.50 and hopefully not a case of salmonella. If that occurs, I will be ballistic. So disappointed today with my burger. Franchises should really train staff so as to keep the quality up."}
{"text":"Hero burgers are definitely certified angus beef, that's thick and juicy with lots of flavour.  I ordered the 8 ozs Hero Burger and was satisfied with every bite because it was very tasty and made to my individualized preference.

Standard condiments were free of charge with additional charges for sauces, cheeses and toppings ranging from $1 - $1.50. 
I was happy they offered lactose-free swiss cheese (only cheese that was lactose-free) because it was a great complement to the burger for an additional $1.50 charge.

Poutine was way too salty and fries were soggy mid-way through eating the burger. I love poutine, but just couldn't finish the order because it was simply not enjoyable with soggy fries and salty gravy.

Overall, a decent burger place in the neighbourhood that is just a little pricey, so best to just stick to the Hero burgers and get Ultimate fries."}
{"text":"This place has better food than the McDonalds down the street but I do have a few gripes. The service took longer than usual (they only had one staff working today), their milkshake machine didn't work (must come back to check since I've heard nothing but good things and I'm a sucker for Strawberry and Vanilla shakes) and their burger was a whopping 17.50! It wasn't too busy and the air conditioning felt nice. I feel bad for restaurants like this that have to compete with McDonald's when this food is so much better quality than the crap McDonalds pulls. I might come back and order something less pricey and to try out their shake. As of now, it's just average."}
{"text":"Thirty minute lunch, so I guess we're having burgers.
I was here with a co-worker, he was a sandwich guy, so I relented.

I went with the signature burger with everything.
I forgot that I wanted gravy with my fries, so when I asked for it, the man behind the counter said the two most egregious words ever spoken at a restaurant; \"Eighty cents\".
I felt my blood boil, and I actually questioned him to make certain that he actually had the audacity to charge me eighty cents for GRAVY!!
I looked over to my friend, so withheld any display of emotion for fearing that I would completely lose control, and lay the slackdown on this guy's candy...
I'll pay an extra ten, even twenty dollars if you told me the beef was fed with soem fancy flavour enhancing product, and raised politically correct, making them the smartest patties...but if you nickle and dime me on things like gravy, you risk turning me into a foul mouthed cannibalistic nineteen eighties' Mike Tyson.
This was after the fact that I tipped this guy!! 
I almost reached into the tip jar and retrieve my generous trip, and use that to pay the most outrageous eighty cents of my life!

It's almost pointless to mention that the service is comparable to those late nineties' stoner movie fast food restaurants. Mouth breathing, visor wearing, unhygienic looking coin pushers who asks you to reconfirm your orders despite you being the only person in the entire place. 

The size of the patty on my burger was much smaller than the burgers I had in other locations, and it was slightly overcooked. I finished my fries, and left just enough gravy to write an 'appreciative note' with it at the table I was sitting to the guy who served me. 
I also refilled my drink without asking if I was allowed to do so. As far as I'm concerned, I was twenty cents away from throwing a major tantrum and completely demolishing the place.
But that would have been pointless, as the space was pretty filthy already.

I would recommend some higher standard in maintenance, because who knows; they might find some change sweeping up once in awhile!"}
{"text":"I'm not that big of a fan of Hero Burger but considering the Mcdonald's at King and Bathurst is sketch I decided why not give these guys a try..I knew I was coming into an overpriced burger establishment that charges you for everything except Ketchup which I absolutely hate. I decided to get the 8oz burger and added lettuce cheddar cheese ($2) and that was it. The guy working cash told the cook my order in which he annoyingly stated THATS IT? THATS ALL YOU WANT ON THE BURGER? If I wanted more and if I wanted to pay $18 dollars for a burger I would have asked for more or gone to Jackastors, so instead of complaining about what other people want on their burgers just do your job and put my burger on the grill. I went to my table and had to hear the cook annoyingly sing christmas music for 10 minutes untill my burger became done. Once done they walked over my order to me but forgot my cup for my $15 dollar combo. I had to walk over and choose my drink from the fancy machine and go back to my table. 

The burger was okay..it's nothing special other than an overpriced burger. It kind of tasted like boxed burgers and I have probably had some better boxed burgers than this establishment. I felt judged and uncomfortable the entire time while eating my burger by these two pricks. 

I won't come here again."}
{"text":"Almost forgot about this place!
My buddy and I decided to grab a bite prior to Tue Toronto FC game.  With pregame underway, Hero Burger was busier than normal and it's hard not.to notice the hoards of Red Soccer jerseys lining up or finishing up their meal.
The location is relatively small, and at times can get busy due to its location in the heart of Liberty Village (right across from Williams Landing).  However when walking in, the place was quite messy with napkins and fries all over the ground.
In terms of food, we both ordered their HERO MOON which was a whopping $15 meal, not sure if its worth it, however when it was all said and done $30 Bill for a burger joint is pricey.
Nonetheless their burgers were decadent along with their hand cut fries, but for the price I'm paying I'd rather go to a bar to enjoy a NON FAST FOOD environment."}
{"text":"Love their shakes (priced at $5.49). Clean and spacious inside. Burgers are around $9, add about $4 more for fries and a pop."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is reported as closed.  Added it as a new business.  I assure you they are open, and their shakes are still a really tasty treat!  5.50 is fine when they're using real milk ingredients."}
{"text":"Prepare for a wait...
The burgers are alright but I am reminded that I won't be visiting here often solely for the long wait time it takes to get a simple burger. Twenty minutes later and still waiting. Staff is terrible and really don't seem to care. Not sure if this is indicative of the rest of the chain but maybe it's telling that the location around the corner at Queen and Tecumseth has just closed down."}
{"text":"I came during the day on a Saturday. It was mostly empty. Very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and chatty. I got the chicken burger with cheese and it was quite good as far as fast food goes. I would pick this over McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came in here a few weeks ago on a rainy Wednesday night. It was dead empty but the lady working was watching The Walking Dead. We interrupted her viewing and she was not too pleased. I can't blame her, it was a pretty rad episode and we cut her off just when it was getting juicy!

We ordered two 8oz Hero Burgers. My friend wanted a milkshake but they were out or something. I was really hungry so chomping on the burger was rather satisfying. It was a big burger, but honestly it wasn't that tasty. The bun tasted a little stale and the patty itself was a bit dry. Don't get me wrong, it definitely filled me up exactly when I needed it, it just wasn't up to the quality of burger I've had at other Hero establishments. It has been a while since my last Hero burger though, so maybe I'm just remembering them better than they actually are."}
