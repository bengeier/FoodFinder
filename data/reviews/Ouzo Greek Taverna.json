{"text":"Perhaps it was just an off day for the restaurant after seeing these reviews but yesterday was my first visit there and I don't expect to go back anytime soon as the food was \"meh\" and the service was non-existent.  The establishment was empty when we got there which should have been an indicator as it was only 6:30 pm. 

My wife ordered the lamb linguine feature and I had the braised lamb. They were out of linguine and said it was ok when asked if we could substitute it for a different pasta.  Needless to say, the best part of the meal was the greek salad and bruschetta appy.  Both our dishes were a tad cold and the lamb quite dry and flavourless.  I would have mentioned something if our waitress had come by but she didn't check in on us once... she virtually disappeared for the next 15 minutes (looked like she was too busy with her macbook) and only came back and \"hovered\" when we paid the bill.  Oh, and she failed to mention that they had selected a different pasta off the menu for my wife and added lamb for an extra $6.  

Should have just gone to Opa's at the food court."}
{"text":"I have eaten twice at this Greek Restaurant and both times waiters were especially busy, I wonder if they get assigned more than 10 tables at a time?  But even so, I am seated quite quickly, and the service I get is always polite and friendly.  But one incident really made me appreciate the servers working at this place.

I was enjoying a meal outside on their patio during the Lilac Festival; I decided to sit outside to witness the on goings of the festivities and in general people-watch which I love to do.  That day was one of my most entertaining meals to date.  First of all Calgary has attracted an extremely multicultural population, not something I am used to considering I was the only Filipina in my small prairie town for around 15 years.  So this influx of colour and general celebration around me is always so refreshing. 

But then the Lilac started to draw to its closing, so people were returning home but folks who had been drinking obviously did not want to so there were literally 3 groups of drunk men who sat down at the patio, wanting to eat a meal and continue their partying on 17th.   

These groups were so unruly cursing at passers bys that the waitress had to ask them to leave.  Why is it that some drunken men think that when they have consumed alcohol they can shout out the rudest of comments to pick up women?  Do they think they are more attractive or charming?  It's just so embarrassing but so entertaining to watch them make asses of themselves.  

The waitress was strong and firm and she asked them to leave in such a charming and humorous way that two of groups left graciously but the last one continued on with their belligerence. 

I had ordered the calamari meal with salad and rice and my waitress was on her way to bring it to me, when one of the belligerent crew flung his arm in disapproval and up went my calamari and the salad and the rice and onto the ground.  Well, his group had a natural reality check and decided to start leaving so the waitress dealing with them corralled the group out of the patio while mine quickly went back inside to place another order.  Another waiter had come out with broom and dustpan and the meal was quickly cleaned up and the incident was over.  All three waiters worked so well together, it was almost like they had orchestrated this many times and not once did I hear them complain or be rude to the group that just left.  My meal was brought within minutes which I enjoyed thoroughly and I could go back to enjoying our wonderful city.  I was so impressed to witness such a fine choreography of events.

My only complaint at Ouzo is that I find the menu here a bit overpriced for the portion I have getting, I have eaten in Greek barrios in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto and have been served up huge portions for less prices.  

But Kudos goes to the staff of Ouzo!  No unnecessary breaking of plates at this establishment."}
{"text":"Three words: Slow, Expensive, Boring.

It is difficult to make Greek food really sparkling, but some people are able to do that. Ouzo failed.

Their food was boring, portions were tiny and we had to wait beyond any reasonable time to get them.

Server was nice, but not overly helpful - and taking in account the speed of Ouzo kitchen I was feeling sorry for him.

Overall experience was to never return, unless there is no other option. Pretty hopeless, I would say."}
