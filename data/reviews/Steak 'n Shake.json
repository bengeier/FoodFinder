{"text":"The first time i came here i loved the oreo shake. But the second time they messed it up. It didnt taste like it did before. They also have the same shakes everytime. They never change the flavors or make news ones like other restaurants do."}
{"text":"Good food and concept but if you want diabetes type 1 go ahead and order one of their shakes too much sugar sorry..."}
{"text":"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had.  Sat at our table for 10 minutes before we flagged down a waitress who said it wasn't her table but she would help us.  My wife asked for a an extra glass from Stephanie to share her milkshake with me.  She was given an absolutely disgusting dirty glass with mustard caked on the outside.  Stephanie never came back to our table after that.  Love the hamburgers but will never, ever go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! This is the most horribly slow drive thru I have ever  been in. You can guarantee that I will NEVER BE back. The food was below average and the fries were cold. 15.00 got me the following: a 40 minute wait in the drive thru,  a cranky toddler, cold fries , and a drink that was filled to the top with ice and no fruit punch. Never, Ever Again!"}
{"text":"Came here late at night. The servers were drunk, which is fine if they could actually serve our food at all.  Also they spit into our food."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know.   I used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about.   After having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach."}
{"text":"this place is mediocre. service was ok and atmosphere was not just there. maybe i went on an off time. the burger prices were a bit more than i have expected. on that note, the burgers tasted great, its a bit small but very good. fries come with the burgers which is always a plus on my side, i love fries. the prices for the shakes are comparable to the burgers. the shakes are a really good size. the burger size is comparable to a big mac in diameter. the heights is about the same as well. just take the middle bun out of it. the fries..... i think they ran out of fries. it was like they sprinkled some fries on the side  to cover up some white space. bummer for me. the shakes came out real fast though, the cups they use are not pre-refrigerated so the drink tends to melt fairly quick. the meal as a whole was good, it filled me up. was my first time here so i had to figure out where to go pay for the meal. which is at the counter. the cash lady not very pleasant, actually discouraged me from tipping in general. this place is like a self serve eatery. all they do is seat you, take your order, bring it out, done. its been about 6 months since i've eaten here so hopefully it got better. still, this place has not crossed my mind once to go eat until now going through yelp."}
{"text":"As a family of 5, frequent customers of steak and shake and new to the area...We decided to give this location a try. Unfortunately, after the experience I had this evening, I cannot see us returning.  Upon entering S&S at 5:45pm, I approached the counter ready to order my family takeout. There was 1 girl at the front who was taking care of another customer. No problem, I can wait. Upon waiting for a few more minutes an elderly man approached the counter and cut in front of me in order to pay his bill. I didn't say anything to him as he was elderly & I'm patient. Of course, the cashier didn't even bother to say that I was first (no big, i suppose) & proceeded to check him out. She was having difficulty with his coupons & requested assistance from an employee named Ashley. Ashley was extremely rude and angry. She told the cashier she couldn't help her, rolled her eyes at the elderly man and slammed the cash register shut doing something else. She stormed off saying \"I can't help you right now\" in an angry tone. She went over to the other side of the restaurant to where she very OBVIOUSLY was gossiping about the elderly man to another waitress as they both looked around the corner in disgust. The cashier apologized to the elderly man on behalf of her rude coworker, \"Sorry, she just has a lot of things to do.\". UM NO? Don't make excuses for her. Her attitude was unacceptable.   Eventually, a manager assisted the cashier with the mans coupons and I was next. Or so, I thought. Another employee handed the cashier the phone & told her to take the order. She looked at me, knowing I was next, and said \"I know you let that older man go in front of you, but I am going to have to take this phone order. I can't keep them waiting.\"  WHAT?! Um okay?? So that is TWO people that steak and shake decided are more important than me? As the cashier was taking the phone order, yet another employee approached the second register. Finally! I would get to order... right?? NOPE. Another customer was standing next to me & she asked him to come forward. WHAT seriously? Eventually, as THREE customers were served before me.... I could finally place my order. And I did so, without problem. 10 minutes later, my order arrived & was ready to take home. By this time, it was 6:15. I am sorry but it should NOT take 30 MIN for a take out order of 3 kids meals. But the service of this place was unacceptable. I didn't even get a single \"sorry\"!."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes, apparently on fries. All tables that came in after got their food first, with fries. But at least we got our bill, yet again, before our food. At least 6 staff, manager included, just standing around. Left without food."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Steak 'n Shake, you don't expect much. But never order any of their seasoned fries, you will NOT get them. The last 3 times I've asked for salt and vinegar fries (including about 20 minutes ago) I just got regular fries. Might not be a big deal if that wasn't the whole reason I went there."}
{"text":"I had a very traumatizing experience at the Steak N Shake in Robinson Town Centre 1951 Park Manor Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15205. I had ordered 2 milkshakes via the drive thru and was told to pull up and wait for them. 20 minutes went by and I still had not received my milkshakes. I went into the restaurant to discover the cashier had \"lost\" my credit card. They said they couldn't find it anywhere (this was an hour ordeal). So I had to cancel my card. Next day they found it but didn't even have the courtesy to inform me. What a big headache and hassle. I had called corporate immediately on Sunday night but it's been past 48 hours and they STILL HAVE YET TO RESPOND TO SITUATION. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never step foot in a Steak and Shake again!!!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I start at how much of a disappointment this place was. First of all the fries make McDonald's fries look like steak fries I've heard of shoestring fries but this place overdoes it. Real milk shakes? Go to McDonalds order a hot fudge sundae stir it up with your spoon thats how real my chocolate shake was.  The only thing this place has going for it patty it was flavorful cooked to near perfection although it was a tiny 2 ounce patty"}
{"text":"Have been here a bunch of times and it was gold in the past. Have been turned away twice in the past month for petty reasons. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I love Steak And Shake and this one is closest to my work. So it's a shame that this is the absolute worst Steak And Shake in the world. I have had MULTIPLE bad experiences here to the point I've stopped going to this one altogether. They got my order wrong every time I went and it's not like I was doing special orders, just normal things off the menu. One time I went through the drive through and after I ordered I got stuck in line for 20 minutes (you can't pull out of line) only for them to screw up my order. I regularly go to the Penn Station next door, do yourself a favor and just go there instead."}
{"text":"Awful. Waited 10 minutes to get sat and have a server come greet us. While waiting at our table for our server, two of the waitresses were standing around on their phones talking about how shitty their tips were that night.   When we finally got greeted my boyfriend tried to order a hotdog as an appetizer while I was still figuring out what to order. He came back later without his hotdog and asked for my order. I had to tell our server that my boyfriend wanted to order more food and that again, the hotdog was just an app.   The hotdog and burgers came out at the same time. Our fries were cold and a little soggy. We felt very unwelcome and will think twice about going to any Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"Work burger ever!!! The owner and his friend were there, totally unprofessional. Don't waste your time or money, total clowns!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the SnS and for once there was no line.  However, one quickly formed after I gave our name for a table for 4.  For the next 20 minutes everyone in the newly formed line was seated  (tables for 2-8) before we were. At the cash register after dinner, I was asked how our experience was. I told them that Blanca (the person taking names and seating people) sat everyone ahead of us for 20 minutes, while my family and I waited even though we were there first.  The cashier said \"oh\".    So glad they don't need the business.  I have been near there twice at dinner time and have skipped them for other alternatives in the area.....and will continue to do so. Our family of four, who love SnS in other states will skip this one from now on.  I would highly recommend Johnny Rockets at the Silverton, which is close to SnS and friendlier wait staff, without the line.  Also, you can catch the mermaids in the Aquarium in the hotel/Casino. I recommend Johnny Rockets over SnS to all my friends.  ***I do  not work for Johnny rockets or the Silverton Casino......anywhere else I love Steak and Shake.  My opinion is this  SnS doesn't need the business or care about their customers. Visit them in other States, but I would steer clear of them in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This was the worst steak n shake I've ever eaten at. Took over an hour to get our food, and even then we still didn't get all of what we ordered.. The only good thing about this restaurant was the cool dude who was at the counter when we payed our bill. I hate you steak n shake."}
{"text":"I came today 10/11/15 and both soda machine had no ice . We told the workers and nobody seemed to care. Bad service"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is bogus. The only real similarity to the Midwest eateries is the name. The burgers were average but the fries were too greasy. Worst of all the place was dirty. Although it wasn't busy, all the empty tables (8-10) needed to be wiped down.  It had been a long time since I Steak and Shaked, and unless I go on a road trip it will likely be a while until I do so again.  I ignored the subpar reviews because I had fond memories of S n S.  I learned that Yelp is your friend that you need to have more faith in..."}
{"text":"Your first impression will be standing up front waiting to be seated.  This will take at least 10 minutes rather they are busy or not.  You will watch a half dozen employees staring over at you but quickly running to look busy.  Once you are seated you will meet your waitress. This person is typically unenthusiastic and will probably take 10min to get to you as well.  Once you get your order in, now is the 20min wait for a burger and fries. I enjoy their food so its sad I had to stop going. The prices are pretty good and over all food is average.  Went back again at 3:25pm on a Monday.  Decided I will try the drive through this time.  It's now 3:48pm and I'm still sitting here waiting.  AlI got was two milkshakes and a drink.  So once again it's a waste of time"}
{"text":"Wife's burger had a hair on it!  And it seems like a place called Steak & Shake would be quicker at making Shakes.  Waiting way too long. Manager did nothing to compensate either."}
{"text":"The hamburger was cold and too thick for an \"original\" hamburger. The fries where not cooked correctly. THE PLACE IS WAY TO LOUD. When the cashier has to keep saying \"what\" a few times it is to loud."}
{"text":"The Good:  It's one of the few places that is open 24 hours.  This can be pretty scary at 3 a.m., but it's nice to know you have more than just Denny's as an option.  Frisco melt has always been a favorite of mine, chili cheese fries- obviously the steak burgers and the milk shakes, for name's sake.  They offer so many flavor combinations it's hard to decide on one- chocolate + banana, chocolate + peanut butter...  The Bad:  I never could understand why it took so long to make a milkshake.  I mean, it is what these people are famous for.  I have never ordered a milkshake and had it delivered to my table in less than 15 minutes any time I've ever been to any Steak N Shake.  The food is bad- not literally, but for you and even though you may feel happy and content eating it, that feeling won't last for too long once you have finished your meal.  The food will congeal into a mass of grease and dairy in your stomach and you won't be able to move. The Ugly:  While I do like the food- in a horrible, bent on self destruction, need to eat the worst thing for me kind of way- there's something about eating in this location that makes me feel like I'm dining in a port-o-potty.  Like everything is covered in germs.  The smells in that place can only come from mopping with a filthy mop and dirty water.   My advice- use the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely great, burgers fries the whole menu. Now on to the bad things. THE SERVICE SUCKS, as a matter of fact Sucks doesn't describe it. Takes longer to get a milkshake than to get and eat your food. On top of this the milkshake was just milk. Workers standing around socializing with other workers. At this location it's about the workers and easy jobs instead of the customers. 0 stars deserved"}
{"text":"Good food and service. A much better Steak n Shake experience here than our last visit to a Steak n Shake in Orlando, Florida!  The food is hot and fresh. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing good, love the burgers. Highly recommend & great service. Food is superb highly recommend"}
{"text":"Smallish burgers but great tasting, my shake was ginormous and very very good. Fed two people and cost only 16 bucks. If you are real hungry you might want to get two burgers due to the size or get one of the half pounds. Pretty fast service as well."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would.  I will never eat here again. My child's glass was so dirty and disgusting. I think they don't even bother washing the glasses.  When we complained the woman apologized for the dirty glass.   Then asked me what she could do for me in a condescending voice.  I said how about clean glass.  I'm pretty sure she wasn't even going to switch it out.   The workers are so unprofessional.  They are loud in the parking lot, service is very slow and the food is gross.   Save your money!!!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place, and for good reason. The burgers are very good with a wide range of specialty configurations including some unique ones such as the \"Frisco Melt\" - a delicious cheese and dressing sandwich. Don't be fooled though - burgers aren't all they do. Some of the tastiest and most warming chili can be found here. Naturally their milk shakes are a treat not to be missed.  Service is average and can occasionally be spotty. A full meal can be had for $4, a great value play for a double burger with fries. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Honestly I cleared my plate and also so did my gf.  The burgers are extremely yummy and I love the pickles they use not to mention how fresh the lettuce is.  They have the best condiments such as the pepper sauce and special fry seasoning.  The shakes are so good and I left with a smile on my face.  Amazing service as well."}
{"text":"The food is good for its value. $4 for a burger and fries plus their shakes are really good! Lots of options to choose from."}
{"text":"I love Steak and Shake, but this location...it just wasn't up to par with the rest. I was seated within a short amount of time which was nice. I've gone here late at night and in the middle of the day. The waitresses seem distanced to their customers and that is bad sign to begin with. There are a few waiters/waitresses that are very nice and friendly, but overall it seems like a lot of people do NOT want to be working there. The food is average, not great like I thought it would be. Its not bad by any means though. But the milkshakes are ALWAYS great. Though every time we order them it takes nearly 20 minutes to a half hour to get them, which is a problem. When we went about midnight one day there was no one there and it seemed like no one was even attempting to get our order. And then after they placed them behind the counter, no one even asked us if they were ours until we approached someone and asked if our stuff was ready. Mind you, this was nearly midnight and there was NO ONE else in the restaurant. Its like everyone disappeared.   The organization is so awful between manager and employee, it just seems like everyone does things willy nilly. I'm not picky when it comes to restaurants, but there does need to be a significant change to get this place back up to park with customer service and food delivery time. I give the cooks and the milkshake makers props though, they do make good food. Once we had a time where we went for just milkshakes and completely forgot our coupons, and a very nice man checked us out and added the coupons though we didn't have them on us. We get them all the time and always save them, but that particular day we weren't expecting to go there for dinner. The bathrooms were very clean though. We had just gone horseback riding and were a little muddy and dirty from touching the horses and had to wash our hands, and the restroom was very clean and neat and stocked with soap and paper towels.  The cost of the food is a GREAT deal considering how much it does fill you up. But the fries somehow don't live up to what I thought they would be. They are VERY thin for being French fries, seems like they may be even smaller than shoestring fries should be. But that's alright, the burger does its job very well! Overall, this place needs a little work but I wouldn't pass it up if you really want a decent amount of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Got better.  Wooo! Tried again and happy with service and food. I will go a 3rd time.  Great shakes.  Very nice.  I even got silverware this time yay"}
{"text":"Finally...a Steak 'n Shake in AZ. Having grown up in the Midwest I've definitely missed them. Unfortunately I'm still waiting for one.   Before coming here I did my research and know the difference between full and signature versions. Yet I'm still giving it a poor review, after 3 trips here now.   Trip 1 - Monday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins. Waited for food for 10 mins, which was good because it took 5 mins of waiting for a table to sit at. BBQ burger was ok.  Trip 2 - Thursday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins again. Waited another 25 mins for food!   Took 10 mins this time to get a table. They forgot to put the lettuce on the burger. Was good tasting but not great. Got to sit and listen to guy arguing with manager.  He said the cheese in his burger was still frozen. She said they don't heat it up and he said he understood that but this was actually frozen, not cold. She offered to make him another one but he didn't hVe time since the wait had used up his lunch break. She didn't offer him a refund but instead took his name so next time he comes in they can give him something. Not good customer service.   Trip 3 - Sunday lunch. Line wait was 5 mins. Pretty quick. Choice of tables since restaurant was less than half full. Shake wait was 2 mins, and food wait was another 5 mins. Definitely faster.  Food was a little worse than previous trips. BBQ burger was smothered in sauce with very little onion strings so it was hard to eat.   Overall Not pleasant experiences.  Music is constantly too loud. People next to us were complaining as well since you have to practically yell to talk to each other.  Wait times during normal lunch times is way too long. I've never waited that long at a full steak and shake and it should be much faster here.  Single size drink sucks. Give us multiple sizes to choose from.  Garbage can opening are barely large enough for the tray to fit in to let alone flip them to empty the garbage.  Seating area wayyyyyy to small.  Food is definitely not the quality of a true steak and shake. If your not going to be one, don't use the name.   Hope this review helps  - still waiting for a steak and shake in AZ"}
{"text":"Honestly. They provide the worst service I have ever experienced. It took them 10 minutes to take our order in the drive thru, then 10 more minutes to give us our food and the food given to us was incorrect. While we waited in line in the drive thru, not one, but TWO cars in front of us left without paying and left without food. It was horrible service."}
{"text":"Well I was excited to come here and even stopped in on a night I could have gone to another burger joint.    When I left I wish I had just got to Fatburger on Mill, last weekend I went to Chuckbox and was glad I did.   Even Five Guys which I am not a fan is 10x times better than the Signature Burger from Steak N Steak.    First start with the positive,  the place was clean and well lit.   Next the ordering went smooth but the staff didn't seem to know much about the burgers.    First they give you everything in a bag making it hard to eat for someone eating in the place,  second my burger was drowning in ketchup.    The fries were cold,  I had to ask for new fries.    The shake was okay, I tried a different flavor but it was not thick enough maybe even watery at times.     The restaurant was not that busy,  but enough people were there around 10:30pm on a Saturday night.    This Kerstin chick must work for the restaurant,   if they can't afford to open Steak N Steak's the right way shouldn't give us a half-attempted location.   I probably will never eat there again, if ever in the Midwest  I will look for a Culver's or Freddy's Steakburger.    This half attempt has lost me as a customer for a lifetime.   I wish all businesses good luck but I wish an In-N-Out burger would open instead.    Save your money and go to a real burger joint."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? My soul is crushed. I don't know what changed but now it's no better than a McDonald's. They used to have organic burgers and like mushrooms and avocado as toppings...now the burgers are the flattest burgers I have ever seen (literally less than a pancake...I've never seen anything like it, actually) and the taste is bleh and they don't have sweet potato fries anymore....is this even a real Steak N Shake?? So upsetting. In fact McDonald's is probably better. Never going here again."}
{"text":"Dear God,  Thank you for putting Steak and Shake at my hotel. (southpoint)  The wonderful cooks at Steak and Shake understand the concept of burgers and shakes....simple...but good and tasty. The 4 of us ate lunch for under $30...THAT'S INCLUDING SHAKES!!!  It's far from the strip, but worth the dang drive....come on people...burgers and shakes made simple...good prices.....no KOBE beef, but well worth it."}
{"text":"My family loves this place, the food is so good, we always leave so full and the milk shakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"I used the drive thru. Took over 25 minutes from the time I ordered until the food was ready. .. I think they had to butcher the cow. .. oh well. . Food wad still great"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Steak N Shake since I was in Indianapolis. Good to see this place out west now. I went in and ordered a Mint cookie shake. The mint was good and the cookie was whack. I expect Oreos in anything with chocolate sandwich cookies. Don't give me knock off Oreos. The shake would have been better with real Oreos or chocolate chips. I probably won't get the same shake again. Maybe the peanut butter cup one next time I visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service , sat at the front counter right in front of all the staff , twice I told them I never got my diet coke , one was a manager and still had to eat my meal dry !  I got my coke to go after I spoke to said manager ...I won't return terrible customer service in these trying times. Wake up Steak N Shake !"}
{"text":"Worst service i've ever had, it took us 5 minutes to sit and the place wasn't even full. When we finally sat, we waited almost 20 minutes before a waiter even came to our table. When we did finally get our waiter and then ordered, we never saw them again and waited for 15 minutes. People around us and who even came after us already finished eating. Horrible service..."}
{"text":"SLOWEST DRIVE-THRU EVER. Seriously, don't even try unless you have half an hour to spend, minimum. I've tried on several different days and times of day over the past few months and it's the same every time. You could literally be the only person in the drive-thru and it will still take at least 10 minutes for someone to take your order. And then they still have you pull up past the window and wait at least 15 more minutes for your food to come out. It's like they have one person working the drive-thru and cooking the food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Juicy, big, signature burger. Positives end there. Freestyle machines not working like you would expect as the sodas were under carbonated. Ice wasn't dispensing. Warm coke Isn't the best. Like others have said, the  fries were soooo salty. I had the Parmesan ones. Throw in a few too many unclean tables. Many other burger places do a better job for me to go back. Hopefully they can improve for those who do choose to give them a try."}
{"text":"I am a burger & fry fiend. I live for them. I've had great burgers in the last place you'd expect; crap burgers at some of these 5 star joints. I know my burgers, beef or chicken, and traditional chicken sammies.   Not sure why I come here, all 3 visits have been the same: just awful. I really wish I knew why this place is popular because I don't see it.  Maybe because the food is cheap. It certainly makes me question what people's standards are when it comes to food - this place is just disgusting.   I ordered a chicken sandwich, a BLT, & cheeseburger. Chicken is dry, so it would catch in my throat & every bite had to be washed down with Coke. (There wasn't anything fresh about my meal that's for certain.)Needless to say my drink needed constant refills...oh wait, my server never offered to fill my cup during her 2 second stopover.  BLT was a joke. \"where's the bacon?\"  Burger...overcooked, no flavor; cheese was obviously processed. Fries looked great but weren't. Portions of each were small, not that it mattered. I wouldn't take a doggie bag home for my dogs from this place if you paid me.   Food is cheap, from price to quality of ingredients & its obvious. If the lines are long because its a cheap place to eat...I won't sacrifice quality for quantity. Steak & Shake most certainly has."}
{"text":"A \"can't believe it\" experience.  Cottage cheese is on the menu.   They are ALWAYS out.  The manager says he doesn't order it because he has to buy too much and it goes to waste.  So order smaller?  He says corporate won't let him.  So why not take it off the menu if you're NEVER going to have it.   I gave 2 stars solely because of a great server, Jeremy, who stood out at a location that is typically VERY slow.  I wish I could give more but the kitchen is always slow, the manager can't control stock and all prior visits have taken well over an hour to get a burger.  My family warned me not to order dessert because \"that always takes as long as the time to prepare the dinner order.\"  Again Jeremy was better at this as well but he remains the sole good example of an otherwise poorly run franchise location."}
{"text":"My server was a very sweet girl.   And that's the best I've got.   Manager greeted me at the door almost the second I walked in and told me he'd be right with me. Then disappeared. A couple of minutes later a server showed up and said \"dine in or take out?\"  Well, hello to you, too, and I'll eat here.   My order was taken relatively quickly. I ordered a shake, a bbq burger, and a side of baked beans. She also offered a glass of water which I accepted. Water came with a straw. Beans came out looking like they'd been baked 20 minutes too long...couldn't even jab a spoon into part of it, it was so overcooked. Honestly not sure why she even brought it out but she did offer me any other side in lieu of the inedible beans. No, I want beans. Ran back to talk to the boss who said they could microwave some beans but they couldn't bake any. Whatever. More on the beans later.   Then came the shake. No straw or spoon, but a promise to return with a spoon momentarily.   Then came the burger (note no mention of the spoon for my shake?). The burger was nothing special by any means. Could gone to Burger King and done better. Really think the menu said grilled onions, but mine were merely diced. (Update: nope, it didn't say grilled. My bad).   Finished the burger and the fries. Drank all the water. Still no spoon.   Beans came out with the manager and an apology (which is why two stars instead of one). Beans also came out with a long spoon. You know, like a spoon for a shake. When I asked for a spoon for my shake, he grabbed a short spoon from somewhere and, noticing the beans had come out with the wrong spoon, suggested we trade the spoons out.  The beans?  Not overcooked this time. Just very lukewarm.   I guess I know why the previous ratings."}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive thru for 30 mins waiting for a burger and 2 shakes. One person in line ahead of me. Shakes were completely melted.  I have visited this restaurant on numerous occasions. Service has never been this bad."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before,during the daytime and is always great. The place is clean. The workers are very nice.   Well on this last visit, it was night time. Around 11:00 pm. We were seated quickly, only 4 other tables. I got my favorite,single steakburger ketchup, mustard, cheese. When it came out it had half pound mustard thats all u tasted remember the saying \"where's the beef?\". My friend got a melt and fries. Four bites into it...UGH hair. The server ran pass so fast.. I yelled at her to stop. She took that one way and brought another out in 6 minutes. Oh.. we didnt finish the food. left plates paid bill.  We never saw a manager....  This place great during the day.. stay away at nite.."}

If you're expecting the Steak 'n Shake of old  (both food and experience-wise), you're going to be disappointed. Great location. Great people watching from the patio (which was dirty). This location is a stripped down menu version. Burgers, shakes, fries, hot dogs... No Chili-Mac, etc, etc...  The well toasted buns and thin edge burgers have turned into a bit of an average, slightly mushy, OK tasting burger. The fries are still great. Had this been a blind taste test, I'd have never guess Steak 'n Shake (and I spent 20 years of my life eating there).    In short, decent food for a decent price on Mill...  If you want food that tastes like Steak 'n Shake used to, go eat at a \"Freddy's\"."}
{"text":"This place is crap. The idea is awesome the outcome is simply not. The fries were scrawny and had no flavor. The shakes were watered down. The burgers were plain tasting. Bottom line: this place has nothing to offer. Stick to In n Out."}
{"text":"This place is delicious  Their shakes are so good!  Staff is nice and respectful  Cheese fries are great!"}
{"text":"I go to this location quite often and I've never had an issue until today. It was very busy and I understand  it took longer than usual. i had asked to have my milkshake after my meal and reminded the waitress of this when I was finished. The waitress was very nice and I know she was busy. I waited about 15 minutes and finally she brought me my milkshake but it was in a to go cup. I did not ask for it to go. When I opened it I noticed the cup was half full of milkshake and the rest was whipped cream. I went to the register and asked about this. I was told it was made correctly. Um ok. So I just wanted to leave. The manager rang up my order with the coupon and it was $6.41. Then she walked away. I wanted to pay with the app, the machine hooked to that register did not work so a different girl rang me up. She asked which receipt was mine and I told her I had a coupon for $4.99 for the meal and shake and I got an ice tea and it should be $6.41 as it still showed on the other register. She looked confused, rang me up but the total did not show on the register. I scanned the app and left. When I got home I got an email saying my meal was $8.19. So the girl knew she did not know what she was doing and just overcharged me. I know it's not a lot of $, but it is unacceptable to know you are doing something  wrong and do it anyway. Be wary using the app to pay and next time I will ask for a paper receipt."}
{"text":"The quality is what you'd expect of cheap fast food hot dogs and hamburgers.  This location, however, is horrible. The manager is very unfriendly and the service is unbearably slow. Having just left this location after waiting 35 minutes for a hot dog and fries, I've decided I will no longer be eating here."}
{"text":"Some people here seem to think this is a sit down restaurant and while they do offer seating with servers its not that sort of joint. Its more like a Fatburger or deli etc. That said for what it is it is very good. The burgers are priced right and taste great."}
{"text":"Limited menu selection if you don't like burgers, but the fries and shakes are very good!"}
{"text":"In search of a quick drive-through burger meal and not wanting to visit the same ol' McD's and Wendy's, decided to give this Steak n' Shake a try.  After the drive-through clerk took the order, very politely and accurately, we pulled around and waited...and waited...and waited.  This was for an order of one hamburger without lettuce, tomato or cheese, fries, a chocolate shake and a hot dog.  Not exactly anything large or elaborate.  The wait went on for well over 5 minutes.  During this time we did receive the shake we ordered, only to find it came in a foam cup so flimsy that (a) the lid popped off while I was transferring it to the car cup holder, causing whipped cream to spill all over me and my car, and (b), the cup further seemed to have a bump or something stuck on the side, which when I tried to wipe it off with my napkin turned out to be a HOLE in the cup through which ice cream was oozing out.  Since we discovered this after we left the drive-through, I had to transfer it to an old McD's cup.  I don't really get this as I have had similar shakes many times at Chick-Fil-A and never had any trouble with their cups.   I will say that the shake at least tasted pretty good.  Rest of the food was meh.  The burger was so covered in condiments (mayo on the bottom, ketchup and mustard on the top) I could barely tell what I was eating and the meat was flavored with weird spice.  Fries by contrast were extremely bland with no salt, and the restaurant had not put any salt or ketchup in the bag.  Who the heck wants to eat salt-free flavorless fries after waiting for a long time to get them?  The hot dog was OK but not great.  I've had better ones from Wawa convenience stores.   I realize this is cheap fast food so I'm not expecting gourmet burgers or even Five Guys quality, but combining the headaches of the milkshake cup and the blah- to ick factor of the rest of the food with having to wait for many minutes to get it means I won't be back to this Steak n' Shake.  Maybe I will give another of their outlets a try.  Would have made it one star except for the milkshake tasting decent and the counter server being professional and nice."}
{"text":"Excellent family restaurant! They have a menu of $4 meals and a great kids menu. My picky daughter loves their mini hamburgers!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy chipotle steakburger with a butterfinger shake. The burger was delicious and the milkshake was excellent as well, more on the milkier side than the creamier side. I liked that it was very reasonably priced for vegas and filled me up without being too much food or too greasy"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both times they got my order wrong. The first time they made up for it by getting me some more fries. The second time I didn't bother going back. It was Saturday night and traffic was crazy. I decided to leave this review instead. I asked for no cheese, onion or pickle and the burger came standard with everything on it. It's like they didn't even try. The burgers, once made correctly, are decent. The shake was alright. Not great. I may give it one more try but so far I'm not impressed. I'll go to Freddy's next time instead."}
{"text":"The shakes are the best!  Love the strawberry shake. The food is good and very reasonably priced. I will be back for a peanut butter cup shake next time."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about the food, drinks, staff, or even the bathrooms. The only thing is the manager at this location is a total jerk towards the employees. His name is Christopher. He should take social skill classes. Great place to eat and hang out with friends. The manger needs to treat his people with respect."}
{"text":"I am currently sitting at Steak and Shake at 10:16 on a Saturday night. There is a sign on the door saying they will be closing early due to a shortage of staff. I, along with some friends, waited for 5 minutes to be seated. Half the restaurant was vacant, yet they still had trouble seating me. After waiting to be seated, we waited upwards of 15 minutes for our first encounter with our waiter, and the encounter was distasteful to say the least. To start, I had to flag him down from across the establishment multiple times. He was impolite during our encounter, and he failed to execute the duties of an amateur waiter. Although I realize I am in a fast food establishment on a bad night, I at least would expect a polite and sorrowful waiter with the irrational wait for a supposedly fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Not even worth a star.  A group of us came after an Indians game for post-game milkshakes to continue a great, clean fun night.  Instead we were greeted by stabbing glares from the staff who were sitting around the bar eating food.  When we were finally \"greeted\" the snobby host proceeded to ask for everyone's ID's and told us that we would not be seated if there was anyone missing an ID.  One person in our group did not have theirs, so we were refused service.  I am baffled by how rude and unprofessional the staff was and offended at their mistrust and condescending glares.  I can guarantee that this restaurant will never get service from me- even if they were to actually give me a chance."}
{"text":"Just because of time sitting at the drive through. Didn't seem busy but took forever. And of course I'm supposed to use my fingers to eat biscuits and gravy I guess.  Edit:  That was the nastiest flavored b&g I have ever had. Whatever sausage they used is horrible. I'm not too sure it wasn't ruined. I may have eColi and don't even know it. Blech."}
{"text":"I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service."}
{"text":"We had been out and wanted to grab a bite as it was late. Decided to stop in and get a burger from this joint as we had driven past it so many times and it's close to home.  We waited a long time and eventually got these small limp dog food burgers with the most awful fries sold to us that we will never eat again. Unbelievable that anyone would rate this above a minus 100 stars. What crap are people eating out there?! Bleeech...  What a waste of money. Burger King if I must but fast food generally no thanks."}
{"text":"Awesome malts, shoestring french fries and burgers. Have to make a pilgrimage whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I really like, not love, this place. I've gone twice, long wait both times, but not horribly long. First time just me and the husband. I got chilli cheese fries, won't make that mistake again. They were pretty crappy. But the mushroom burger was tasty. We had went after a movie, where we had some popcorn and that junk so there wasn't room for a shake. This last time we took the kids and they really enjoyed it also. They got little paper cars to put together with stickers that were cute. On to the food: I got the mushroom burger again cause it was just so good the first time, as did my husband. It did not disappoint. Don't get me wrong their not gourmet burgers by far, but their good. Servings aren't huge, but the prices aren't either. Nice selection of shakes we got the cookies and cream and butterfinger. I'd take the fam back for sure. It wasnt that much more then say Mc Donalds but a far better experience"}
{"text":"Our server Haley definitely made it clear we were her last priority. After waiting about 20 minutes to even come to the table, she took our drink order and and didn't come back for 15 minutes at least. It was not even busy, maybe 4 other tables and 2 other servers. We were looking at her just standing there talking and not getting our drinks. She even Refilled a different tables drinks, then went back to talking to other workers before getting our drinks. It's too bad because we all really like steak and shake. The manager was just hanging out not very concerned that his restaurant has a lot of issues."}
{"text":"the burger and fries was okay. the shakes  -awful. I sent back the first one (cookie dough) for lack of flavor. Then tried the peanut butter cup  -yuk, NO FLAVOR!!! I finally asked - do you use ice cream - the answr, NO, we ise a shake base. That explains the ice milk taste. No real ice cream in the darn things. A McDonalds shake has better flavor. No flavor. I didn't drink it. why waste the calories? Johnny Rocket's a much better choice."}
{"text":"\"Been a long time I shouldn't have left you!\" This is a staple for me when I hit Vegas!  Being from Cali it isn't something I can get all the time. Steakburger shooters was my weapon of choice this time. I love to customize and they were very receptive to it.  I went with Cajun, Chipotle and BBQ but added grilled onions and Bacon along with Cajun fries. The meal starts at around $6 so a little customizing won't break the bank!  I had water with the meal because I had to finish this madness with a shake. Mocha with fresh banana was my guilty pleasure.  If you haven't tried them live a little your in Vegas,  why not?"}
{"text":"This place has got to be one of the most poorly managed and staffed businesses in Steelyard Commons... and THAT is saying something.  I walked in, and was systematically ignored by all 7 employees and the manager that were working.  However, I was treated to a show of the manager and the employees complaining about customers, yelling at each other, and carrying on other personal, inappropriate conversations.  They were not busy, no one in the drive thru, and only a few people in the dining room.  There was only one waitress that even acknowledged me, and that was after I was standing there for almost 8 minutes - (yes, I know the exact number of minutes, because I ended a call when I walked in the door.)  She only said hello and that someone would be right with me; which didn't happen.    I walked out, went across the street to Five Guys where I was greeted the moment I walked in the door with a friendly smile and great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to these regularly but wow, is Steak 'n Shake going down hill or what? I took my gf there a week ago and as usual they were busy, nothing new. We saw, what was the 2 managers on duty, one male (Steven) and a female (Katie) running around seating people, busy tables, taking food the customers and cashing people out while the servers just stood around and talked amongst themselves, some were on their cellphones. They should be ashamed of themselves! The managers doing ALL the work while they do NOTHING! We felt so bad for the 2 managers, especially when Steven asked the servers if they'd help bus their tables and they refused.  I can't believe SNS hires these kids?! I don't see how anyone would want to manage there!  If you gotta have a shake, only go when those 2 are working.!  We could tell that they are trying to turn it around but they are only 2 people."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a Steak 'n Shake was opening in AZ after falling in love with it in Indiana. When they first opened, they offered a larger menu. Now they have a very limited menu and removed pretty much everything I would order at Steak 'n Shake. No more banana shake or guac, egg, etc on their burgers. Very disappointed. Parking is a pain on Mill (and not free) and with a very limited menu, I will not be visiting this location anymore."}
{"text":"the appearance is grand. like a little fifties diner. the food is really good and all only cost 4 dollars! they have a very large selection on milkshakes. 5 dollars milkshake. the wait to be seated if always around 20-30 minutes. been here on many occasions the servers are great and they have a large seating. the wait for the food is alright considering the amount of people the serve. they even have a separate line for to-go. the location is inside of southpoint casino. they even have a bowling alley and arcade right next to it! this has to be one of my favorite places to eat out."}
{"text":"Good fast service. Good food. Milkshake tasted a bit off, but good experience overall."}
{"text":"Have eat here several times when in town. Great consistent burgers. Never crowded. A good cheap meal. Nice servers."}
{"text":"Experience eith manager very unprofessional.  Order had four mistakes plus shortages when arriving home.  Brice, the manager did nothing to correct this situation.  Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"No stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I'm sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it."}
{"text":"The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors.   The burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I came here on my wedding day 4 years ago and it was fantastic. I have been to one of their new locations in California and it is also very good. However, this weekend when I came back to steak n' shake it was terrible. The place smells like old grease trap. The tiles in the floor are caked with grease debris. You can just tell no one there cares anymore about the product they are providing. Personally the manager need s to be let go. I have worked in the food business before and there is no excuse for this type of laziness."}
{"text":"Every table was dirty when we walked in and no one cleaning  any of them.  The menu station  was disgusting!  It took 5 minutes  for someone  to come over to us,  We were about to walk out . Clean this place up guys!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was an awful experience. The service was horrible. The waitress took our drink order and we waited about 5 min before she brought them to us. She stood and talked to other employees before she brought them. There was some issue with the cooks, so she was yelling at them and yelling for the manager. The manger just seemed to be going in circles and not really caring about what was happening. Was done with the meal before we were offered any refills."}
{"text":"Great for fast food. 24 hour burgers and milkshakes save me on long work days. Wait is sometimes long but worth it"}
{"text":"Affordable and fast, not to mention taste great!  Fed a family of 6 for a more than reasonable price. We all got burgers and the chili cheese fries were good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to the fries and shakes here!!   Love the banana shake service is fast and food  quality is excellent! Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here. Finally ordered after 10 min in a line that barely moved and waited for about 35 min before we asked where our order was. They couldn't even find it anywhere. It wasn't on the screen or being made..nothing. Well, considering I had other things to do I had to leave. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent! However, the location was a MESS! The ice machine was broken when we walked in, ice  spilled everywhere & nobody cleaned it until after we got our food. I even heard the staff arguing with the manager when asked to clean up & take the over flowing trash out. The food... It was Disappointing. It looked nothing like the menu. I've never thrown out a half finished shake & burger. The fries were all in small pieces. It was an overall bad experience. I do hope the staff moves on to bigger & better someday, especially the manager with his good attitude & personality."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru at Steak'n shake in Brooklyn, by 480, and was VERY disappointed.  First I was rushed by a rude employee to order. Also I ordered 2 sides of cheese for fries and they said they could only give me 1. Sadly, while sitting waiting for our food, I overheard a manager (very tall man) say \"I swear to god, I'm going to kill you\" to an employee because food wasn't fast enough. I kept hearing him repeat some negative comments to his employees. That is no way to treat an employee, he doesn't belong in this business. After waiting at the window for 10 mins, the rude drive thru employee had to ask us what we ordered again. Besides the unorganized service, the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because I need to counter the other Yelpers who are giving this place 1 and 2 stars reviews. Before we start any discussion, let's look at the prices on the menu. Most items are below $5. You can get a burger, fries, and a drink for $4. These are fast food prices, people. Please adjust your expectations accordingly. Also keep in mind that this is place gets hit hard with movie-goers. Really, really hard. It gets slammed on movie nights and there's usually a 15-20 min wait to get seated. Burgers are fine. Not amazing, but not bad either. The burger's just an excuse to chug down one of their tasty milkshakes anyway."}
{"text":"The burgers were very good.  Try to go during an off hour because the dine in line is hella long!!"}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake has a cool, modern interior, but the building was more impressive than the food.  burger.....not the best- bread was dry and meat wasn't that flavorful, even the guacamole couldn't salvage that (I ended up only eating half).  fries....yummy!  shake.....okay.  If I'm going to splurge and eat some crazy calories, then it has to be really worth it.  I wouldn't return to Steak 'n Shake for that reason."}
{"text":"Great burger, awesome shake, but the fries were disappointing. Service was decent, place was clean & fine parking is hard to find on mill."}
{"text":"I love Steak 'n Shake's food, their burgers have a great taste like no other, and the shoe string fries are the best (especially with some of their seasoning). It's really a hit or miss at this location, and depending on which server you have. We've had a few that were great... friendly, attentive and fast. Then we've had a few that were awful. The last few times we've gone, you have to order extra fries because they barely give you any. And if you want your order to be correct, do NOT use the drive thru or call in. Every single time I've ordered through the drive thru, the order has been totally wrong."}
{"text":"Went at 6:37 pm on a Sunday and waited almost 10 minutes for food. I was the only one in line. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love steak n shake BUT this location lacks all the fundamentals that are practiced at the other locations. Their milkshakes are soupy, the need to be trained on the breakfast menu pricing since everything isn't on the drive thru menu, and they get upset when you question then about misquoting the prices! One time I ordered a sausage bagel and a breakfast burrito. The had the nerve to use a portion of the patty for the sandwich in the burrito! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving.........Burger is comparable to a $1 burger at a fast food chain.  Milkshakes are total artificial flavoring!  Don't let the cheap prices tempt you!"}
{"text":"This review is for service only. My boyfriend loves this place and wanted me to try the Shake n steak food. They seated us down fairly quick. After 20 minutes of waiting for our server, my boyfriend got up and ask the manager if they were going to take our order. She replied that someone will be there shortly. The server came by our table and told us she needed 5 minutes. We ended up leaving after waiting for another 10 minutes with no server on site. The restaurant was pretty much empty, so I don't see why it took them so long to take our order."}
{"text":"I went to the one in the Southpoint. I have heard people claim that this is the best they have ever had. I found the burger OK, but not as good as a Big Mac. The fries are easily the best thing, and worth trying. Food, like taste in music and film, is subjective. This is just my POV. The service for the take out was good, and friendly."}
{"text":"Last time I ate here, the food made me really sick.  The young people making the food were laughing and goofing off.  God only knows, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I know service speed isn't a chain-wide issue. This place is just REALLY. SLOW. We ordered 40 minutes ago. Still no food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the recent changes.  They eliminated the $4 menu which is a staple offering for this chain, also they eliminated the large shake size option but raised the prices $2.00 above the chain prices in other markets. Also, don't offer kids eat free Sunday's another Steak n shake tradition. It seems this location is way too greedy, and very disappointing to a regular steak n shaker who frequents this chain in other markets."}
{"text":"This place is really good especially for the value !!! Milkshake is really good ! And the burgers are great too ... Would have to try out !!!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. However, I can't believe this right now. Me and my boys roll up and want some food. We were cranked. This bitch says \"we don't make two orders through the drive thru\" I'm bout to spaz out. Fuck steak and shake, I'm screaming it."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the service here was horrible... The waitress only saw me three times... The first time she came was 10 min after we had already been seated...to take our order... The second was to give us our food and then the third times was to finally give us napkins and silverware... Not very good..."}
{"text":"We went through drive thru for some milkshakes. My milkshake was so freezer burned I could not drink it and I just ended up throwing it away. If we had not already left I would have tried taking it back. I honestly can not believe they even served me that. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a half empty, but still dirty restaurant. Tables left with food stains, and receipts, trash (napkins, straw wrappers) all over the floor.  The cashier had no idea how to apply the Hooked app discount, so I just never got it.  No one had trays, so I guess they don't provide them, I had to make do with my bag of food on the dirty tables. Catsup containers were out, and the soda machine area was littered with ice on the floor. On a positive note, the original double cheese and Cajun fries I ordered was absolutely delicious, and the cook was very customer service oriented. All in all..great food, littered restaurant..."}
{"text":"Of course it's a scaled down version of the restaurants that I've gone to in the Midwest. So happy that I'm able to get the classics here in AZ - double steak burger, regular fries and a milkshake!!! It was delicious - thanks for bringing a bit of home to the area!"}
{"text":"Went here expecting some good stuff after reading the reviews and hearing about Steak N Shake...  Located at South Point Casino.   Expected a long line and that's what I got. Even on a Sunday night. So, I decided to just get the food to go, which was still a long line. Prob a 10 min wait to go place an order then prob another 5-7min to get the food.   I ordered the original double cheesburger, fries, and mint cookies n cream shake. The burger was good but nothing special. And small. I should've ordered a triple AT LEAST. fries were super skinny and just ok. the best part of the meal was the mint shake. had i known what the burger and fries were like i wouldve just gotten the shake and got food somewhere else. the shake was super good and filling. good stuff.   quality and price do not match up at all, thats why i knocked off stars. i payed $10.50 for a double cheeseburger, fries, and a shake. my meal was def was not worth that much. overpriced for the size/amount of food you actually get. it prob to me shouldve just been worth $7 total. the burger was tiny and fries to match.   I SAY, GO HERE FOR THE SHAKES ONLY."}
{"text":"If you are low on funds but want to go out to eat, this is definitely the place to go. The food is cooked to order and is served nice and hot. The chicken tenders are very tasty, the fries are seasoned well and the milkshakes are.......sinfully delicious! Do not come here if you're dieting cause you'll fall off the wagon. But your taste buds will Thank you....insert smiley face here."}
{"text":"Visited December, 2010   I have been to Steak & Shakes in Missouri & Indiana before & I wanted to see how they would be here in Vegas.   First off, all the Steak & shakes I have been to are open 24 hours. Too bad that isn't the case here in Vegas, a 24 hour town & inside a Casino to boot!   The food here was pretty much the same quality that I have had from the others, with the exception of it being a lot cleaner here, being brand new & all. Also, the fact that the grills here don't have years of seasoning on them yet, so the taste is slightly different. This place is extremely bright & reminds me of a Clean Room or a Hospital. A feeling you definitely wouldn't get from any of the ones I have frequented :P   My date du jour & I came here pretty late one night during the week, about an hour or so before closing, so fortunately there wasn't much of a line. We both weren't too hungry, so we just went with some Seakburger Shooters & a couple of milkshakes.   We had Buffalo, Frisco, Ketchup & Mustard & Ketchup & Onion shooters. I had a Chocolate Covered Strawberry shake, which was a special at the time & my date had a Peanut Butter Cup shake. The shakes were pretty awesome! Unfortunately, they kind of messed up the Shooter order & had to bring out some extras to make up for it, needless to say, they never got it right :P But whatever, we got some FREE Shooters out of the deal & I do love FREE!!   Overall, I will come back whenever I am in the mood for a decent shake or a Frisco Melt, which is usually what I get anyways. I would recommend this place for someone who hasn't tried it before & form their own opinions about it."}
{"text":"Now I use to eat at a S&S in Kanas City and I loved it. This is not that same food, not even close.  I had the double cheese, tasteless. Really not good, obviously corners have been cut from what I knew from the past. Plus the restaurant was not clean, table tops not wiped off the ketchup machine didn't work, just a mess. I was disappointed big time."}
{"text":"I love steak and shake! I do, however agree with some of the recent reviews about the shakes coming later than usual lately though... they are late, but they are still DELICIOUS!!! Steak and shake has some of the BEST shakes in town. Seriously. Just try one if you haven't already. My favorite is the chocolate banana with real bananas. SOOO GOOD!!! Ok, now onto the burgers... I have been there quite a few times and almost each time, the burger was delicious. The only burger that I did not find to be really appetizing was the bacon lover burger. It was just lacking in flavor and the bacon wasn't that good. nothing like the picture. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. Not wanting to be one of \"those\" customers to complain or send food back, I just opened the pepper sauce up, poured some on my burger, and ate a few peppers with my burger. Instant fix. Other than that, I have never received any cold or anything that the other people have complained about. I also love their onion rings! Sooo delicious!!!!! They make me smile just thinking about them! The reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of five is because of the sup-par burger and also, sometimes their service is kind of slow. Nobody has ever been rude to me either... slow, yes. Rude, no. Just go try the place out. FIRE."}
{"text":"SLOW...SLOOWW...SLOOOOOOOW! Went there 2 months ago and the food was the Normal S'nShake good- but the service SLOW! Thought it might have been and off day so on a Sat, we decided to go again but the same thing happened- waited 35 min for good and this was the case EVERYONE in the dining area. Waitresses stayed behind the pop machine or in the back to avoid people complaining, tables next to us were left dirty the whole time we were there- Major negative Energy in the place. We would have left but the waitresses never came back to the table so we could at least pay for our drinks. Food was warm and just OK.  We just moved to the area so we're bummed that this is 'our' S'nShake. Hope things change in the future."}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap My guacamole burger was delicious in all the wrong ways. Burger comes with fries Friendly staff Cons: Meat was thin and greasy AF (could be a pro) Over salted fries"}
{"text":"Nasty. Nasty. nasty. Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. How about this yet a rag, a bucket of soapy hot water, a fresh mop bucket and scrub the tables the floors, under the tables, the walls, the seats. How anyone can even dare eat at this nasty, filthy place. I am calling the health department you should be ashamed of yourselves!"}
{"text":"We recently vacationed in Las Vegas and stayed at South Point so we were able to eat at Steak and Shake a couple of times.  The kids loved the food.  I loved the prices.  I had one complaint... the steak burgers are so thin.  Like wafer thin.  I was wondering why most of the burgers were double patties.  Other than that I was happy.  It was also nice because there is a take out section so you can have your food to go too BUT you have to order at the register.  No phone orders.  :("}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake is literally the best bang for your buck. You cannot go wrong,  even when the service is mediocre. The food is delicious. Would recommend to anyone coming back from Africa, or abroad. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Steak and Shake Rocks here...Even though ....Happy hour Milk Shakes Changed .....I Admire their Professional Attitude ....These Folks deserve...All our Respect .....Thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst Steak and Shake we have ever visited and that is saying a lot since we travel a lot.  First the good:  The order taker was friendly.  Place was clean.  The Bad:  This is is what the $15/hour will look like.  While in most Steak and Shakes we have been in there are waitresses and such.  This place was run by 4 people.  It was set up like a McDonalds.  Daughter ordered Chili Cheese fries and the Chilie tasted like it was run through a sewer.  Burgers were smaller than usual.  I was a bit concerned as we took bites back for the dog and she hesitated in eating them and she eats just about everything.   We were thinking about taking the extended family here on one of our outings.  So glad we checked it out first. Won't be going back to this one ever."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place so I figure I would give them a few tries. Every time I go thru the drive thru the service is horrible and the order is never correct.   . I think today will be my last visit.    Yesterday I went there and they said they have no sausage?!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I attempted to eat lunch here today... after waiting 15 minutes we still hadn't been seated or told someone would seat us soon or anything, we left. We rarely go here for just that reason... we actually refer to it as Steak and Wait!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, if you can get someone to provide any service. The restaurant was half-empty and it still took nearly 5 minutes to be seated. After 15 minutes no one had come by the table. Took a few minutes to leave a note on the paper place mat on why we left. This is one of the most inefficiently run Steak n Shake restaurants."}
{"text":"MMM cheap eats in Vegas, gotta love it! Thank you South Point for bringing this franchise to Vegas! If you like In & Out, you'll enjoy Steak & Shake with their expansive menu of burgers/dogs, sandwiches, chili/salads and milkshakes under $6.   The burgers are good and um cheap! I was still hungry after I finished the Royale that I thought I should have ordered something else. That is until I forgot I had a mint chocolate chip milkshake. Once I finished that puppy, I hit the wall. I was done!  So looking for cheap eats and good milkshakes, check this place out. Just keep in mind, that the waiting line can get long but the price alone is worth the wait. Steak N Shake it out!"}
{"text":"They just took our order.... the filth on the floors is disgusting. Its been 40 mins. We have our water & they took our order.  By far, the worst experience at a Steak n Shake we've ever had. Based on other reviews and mine, please dont come here. .........."}
{"text":"Typically I would give a good review but not tonight. I came here after ice skating with my daughter and her friends and one of the girls happened to be a vegetarian. Now from all the burger joints I've been to lately they at least have some kind of selection that is vegetarian friendly.  Not this place. While they do have a veggy patty melt loaded with mushrooms which she doesn't like, and grilled cheese sandwich,  they do not offer a garden burger or even a bean burger for that matter. When I asked the waiter what other options there were his reply, in a snotty and rude way was \"why don't you just order a salad?\" To my reply was that one of my girls wanted a burger not a cheese sandwhich. After ordering a patty melt it came back spicy which she couldn't eat and the burgers that we did order were dry and fries were cold and service was CRAP! That was money that could've have been  spent at smashburger with a better variety along with better service and better vegetarian options. Hate to.say it but thanks to the rude service I will definitely not be going back. I'd much rather eat at smashburger or five guys."}
{"text":"We were here two years ago and we were looking forward to eating here again. Unfortunately the experience fell short for us. Yes the old soda shop feel is nice but when you're seated at a table with old tomatoes slices stuck to the floor under it, it's disgusting. We were served old, under the heat lamp fries which were sent back. If there is a next time, we may get milk shakes to go or not."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a snack and milkshakes on out of Pittsburgh. The food was good and the milkshakes were really good and nice size for the price. I loved our waitress Chrissy who gave my boyfriend a hard time!!"}
{"text":"Though I was seated immediately, it took an hour and 15 minutes to even be asked what I wanted to drink. A table sat after me literally ordered and left before she even got to me. To make matters even worse, there are recently these tiny bugs everywhere all over the restaurant. They assured me they were being taken care of but trust me, you would see it. I have personal experience with this problem. As soon as they landed on my food(hot dog) I just stopped eating. I feel sick now thinking they might have even been on my fries. I don't suggest ANYONE EVER eat here. In summation, this place is a ghetto trash heap with service to match."}
{"text":"Great shakes but in and out has much better burger and fries. Luckily we got here right when it opened because it seems to always have a crazy line out front...tip it opens at 11am. ...so we were seated right away. I was so excited to see what all the hoopla was all about. The decor is diner chic , nice and clean for sure. We got our menus and I was surprised to see how reasonable the food was. I decided since it was my first time, I should try their original double burger with cheese, this came with fries .I ordered a chocolate milkshake. Well, our burger came well before our milkshake and that was dissapointing...we were almost done with lunch before we got it. The dbl burger really isnt very big at all, I know my husband sure would be able to eat more than one. It is substantially smaller than a dbl dbl at in and out. The fries were pale and limp and cold...I barely ate them at all; why bother! When the milkshake came it was delicious I have to say. I will return and get a milkshake from the takeout window, but no need for me to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Had to wait for 10 mins to get seated... Fries were cooked in oil which was used for a long time(may be a day I believe so), so the fries leave bitterly taste in your mouth.. Overall cheap but no quality.."}
{"text":"I love steak and shake. I loved it in SC (until the only one within a 70 mile radius closed) and I love it here. Where do you go when you're up late working on engineering homework and the cafes are closed but you need sustenance? Steak and shake! Where do you go after the bars when you're hungry but not quite drunk enough for merry ann's? Steak and shake! The food is a little more expensive, but it's tasty and the place is clean. The waiters are very friendly and accommodating. Also, if you go at the right time, you can see what not having a waffle house can do to a town (steak and shake kind of catches crazy people)!  PS they will put hot fudge on your milkshake.. what else can a girl want?"}
{"text":"if you are from the mid west where they have real steak and shake you will be disappointed, it is not the same this is a signature restaurant, they have the same name but not the same experience and food choices are limited, nonetheless still good!"}
{"text":"I've been to this chain in Pennsylvania and Arlington and enjoyed my burgers & shakes. This time I tried the chili spaghetti.  Great flavor and consistency of pasta. However, it came out only barely warm. By the time I got our waitress' attention it was cold. I asked if they could reheat it. I was told they never take any food back to the kitchen but she would check. She came back a bit later with a cup of hot chili and told me the cook said to just pour it on top! That made me a little upset and so the manager came over. She, too, refused to reheat my dish and when I asked to simply take it off my bill , she basically said I had eaten too much of the entree and that wouldn't be possible. Honestly, ate 3 forkfuls! Eventually, she agreed to remove the item from my bill and was apologetic but I still left hungry. So...1 star and no soup for You!"}
{"text":"This place has really awful service. So slow. 20 minutes for 2 milkshakes to go?? Not acceptable. Poorly managed."}
{"text":"Rushed service from a terse waiter with initial A.   Was too busy to bring a straw, forgot to enter items in the system, grabbed dishes before everyone was finished. Never brought a check, just left the kitchen printout on the table.  We were all disappointed.   Food was ok."}
{"text":"We just love Steak 'n Shake, their food is really good and their prices are amazing. If you look in the Sunday paper they usually have coupons. Their chili is delicious and their milkshakes are so rich and creamy. Nice atmosphere and perfect for children."}
{"text":"Started at the drive-thru last evening and when the line hadn't moved in over 5 minutes I parked and went inside to order.  Two people ahead of me at the \"Takhomasak\". The girl at the register was clueless at how to change a $100 bill. Manager (at least I think he was the manager) was trying to walk her through how to open the safe (while flipping burgers - sorry, STEAK burgers). Anyway, now we all know the safe is located under the register. He was barking orders at her on which key opened the safe - \"It's the PURPLE one!\" When she finally took care of the two people ahead of me, I tried to give her my take out order when a gentleman who had been sitting quietly at the counter finally said to her \"I was here before any of these people and you have completely ignored me.\" She didn't apologize, just asked him what he wanted.  After he placed his order I asked her how long she thought it would take for MY order because I was now approaching 20 minutes of my life I will never get back, She said \"Honestly, you'd probably do better if you went through the drive thru.\"  I left.  Never EVER to return. This was not my first disappointment at Steak and Shake.  I'm like a battered woman - I keep thinking the next time it will be different.  It's not."}
{"text":"My brother and i went here to eat something before a movie. We were standing waiting to be seated for 10 minutes when someone finally said \"you can sit wherever \". Then another couple people walked in and were seated immediately and their order taken. We eventually got up and left when we continued to be ignored.  Unfortunately we were the only white people in there and that is the only reason i can think of as to why were pretty much ignored while everyone else was helped and aknowledged at all. It's messed up because we come from a mixed family where race isnt an issue, but here it apparently is."}
{"text":"Well, to me chili MAC means there would be macaroni noodles. Nope, it was the worst spaghetti I've ever had. Don't name a dish and serve something else. And if you do it should at least be good, well that was far fetched."}
{"text":"Good food  Nice staff  The decoration is modern  Just the place needs clean all the times"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Steak N Shake in Arizona. Delish as always!!!! And the negative comments must be competitors because the food is great."}
{"text":"The service here was very slow and sporadic. The server took forever to bring our order. Said he would bring us napkins right away and it took 5 minutes, after we got our food, to get napkins. We asked for ranch dressing and the server left to go full ketchup bottles and never brought the dressing. Another server came over and had to bring g the dressing."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Steak n Shakes all over the midwest, so my 5 star review is as much for nostalgia as it is for the food and service.  Chili mac is my absolute favorite.  Though it may not be for everyone, spaghetti topped with spicy beef and ketchup. I LOVE it!  Also, the shoestring fries are crisp and hot.  And you cant beat the prices.  I believe they have a few meals for under $4....now thats a bargain!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. That ended up not being the case. It appeared as though the staff were very new and lacked proficiency. Although the service was a little slow and awkward I had a good lunch. Kudos to the manager for jumping in to help his team when necessary. I will probably return in a few weeks and see if things have improved. I enjoy the food and especially the prices."}
{"text":"Best part was the shakes. Burgers were average and pretty dry. Shoestring fries were okay but not great. Seasoning salt at the table definitely helped. Don't think I'll go back again. Left disappointed with my meal after hearing good things about this place."}
{"text":"For those of you from the East Coast and the South you should be very aware of Steak and Shake. But for everyone else let me tell you about it. First off, Steak and Shake has the feel of a 50's diner. So right off the bat it is a fun place to go and hang out. No servers on roller skates though, darn. The menu is primarily Burgers, Dogs, Chili and Shakes. There is more, but that is what most of the menu is. The burgers are made of Sirloin Steak. The patties are about 2oz each. So they are thin and have a bit of crunch at the outer edge. The burgers are served medium well. This is a very good burger. The fries are part way between a shoestring and regular sized fry. They have a nice flavor and a good crunch because of their thickness.  The shakes are hand scooped. The combinations of shake flavors is almost limitless. The thing about the shakes that I like the most is that they are twice a large as you would expect them to be. They taste great and have a very creamy texture. They are also chilled nicely and hit the spot.  The service is fast. They get to your table quickly. They bring the food quickly. The tables are cleared quickly. The only issue I had was that I did not see many smiles on the workers faces. A few, but most did not. You can make the assumptions you want to make about that yourself."}
{"text":"i've seen a lot of reviews posted so far that knock the fact you can't get the full menu. fair enough, its a busy location and they want to keep things moving quickly. i can dig it. but here's the real problem with this steak & shake - well, its just kinda sucky.  First off, the \"experience\" is nothing like what you get at a normal steak & shake. this steak & shake makes me think more of what it would be like if you traveled through time to 2064 and visited a \"retro\" Steak & Shake, where everything is high-gloss plastic and frosted glass. the benches are plain white fiberglass plastic stuff with no cushion, fairly uncomfortable to sit in for more than 15 minutes. the ordering system is that type where you walk in, some creepy grinning schuckster is there to take your order and repeatedly tell you \"its just like a regular steak & shake, but not\"... there's no friendly wait staff, there's no grill men you can watch from your seat making  your meal.   I ordered a chocolate milkshake - YUCK. one of the things that you come to expect from a place called Steak and SHAKE is a real milkshake. you know, made from milk and ice cream. this was clearly some kind of bag formula that had ice added since there were nice big chunks of it in the milkshake. at least it had real whip cream on top.  the girlfriend ordered a frisco patty melt thing... which was pretty weak too. two pieces of sourdough, frisco sauce and two patties. wow. i told her after leaving, \"you can tell your friends you still havent had steak & shake cuz this doesnt count\"  Really, this feels more to me like a cash grab trying to play off midwest nostalgia since most of illinois is relocating to arizona.  think of this steak & shake as like when you go to guatemala and visit mcDonalds. its kinda the same, but not really. while we were eating, a family visting from the midwest sat down next to us. \"well, what do you think, son?\" (clearly asking what he thought of the ASU campus area)  \"well, steak & shake is nice, but there's a lot of weirdos around\"... so yeah, think of it as a kinda-sorta-not-quite taste of home when the mean streets of tempe arizona get you down."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. They need a lesson in people skills. Go through the drive thru and the lady won't even let me order and keeps cutting me off. Hands me my food without saying anything. I ask her if that's everything and she looks at me like I'm an idiot and says yea. Clearly she was wrong because I didn't get spoons or straws with my 2 shakes. So, I go into the restaurant to get them. Another woman on the grill ignores me instead of simply asking what I'd like even if she was too busy to get it. I end up waiting 10 minutes on the waitress just to get 2 spoons and straws. I don't understand why what was so hard about that."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A fries are better. They were also too skinny like ho back to mcdonalds where the food there and the food here have in common - they both taste like burnt crap"}
{"text":"We have been to this Steak n Shake multiple times around 11pm and with each visit our table is ignored for at least 15 min and the tables all have dirty dishes. They are definitely short staffed around this time of night. Our waitress made it up to us with her friendliness."}
{"text":"The absolute worst steak n shake in Champaign-Urbana. Go to Neil st or Prospect!  This location is awful! They ALWAYS mess up your order and the food is cold. I've had it with this location. The staff is always pissed off Seriously, do yourself a favor, don't be like me. Don't make the same mistake...."}
{"text":"Steak N Shake has the best service around. Upon walking in, you are immediately greeted by the waiters and waitresses who are so friendly, it's almost clingy at times. Good service and really yummy fried food. Greatest milkshakes around. Anywhere."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the prices and taste of their burgers. I was expecting like a steak and potatoes restaurant, but oh well, a burger is always good.   The portions of onion rings were skimpy, but for the price, I can't really argue! Less than $5 for a meal, you can't really go wrong. And this place has a decent burger. I think that I said that already."}
{"text":"I like Stake and Shake, but just not this location. There was a lot of staff, but not good service. We asked for a table, had to wait for them to get around to cleaning them off, then 2 families were seated that came in after us. The hostess didn't remember writing our name on her clipboard. Then Courtney rolled her eyes when I reminded her a second time for a table not a booth. Service was slow. Order was wrong, like he never even heard us, our side salad came way after our burger and fries were served. One refill after a long wait for food. Bottom line is the food was good for the price, staff and service need big improvement, and if you chose this location make sure you have time to wait...and wait...and wait."}
{"text":"I hope they were just having an off day but I walked in & placed a to-go order & waited 30 minutes for 2 burgers, a chicken sandwich some fries, rings & a couple shakes. We live not more than 6 minutes from there & the meals were completely cold when we got home. The good news is that so were the shakes & they were delicious, so I suggest sticking with those & eating in. We ordered double burgers & the patties were so thin we didn't actually think 2 of them were even on there. #WontBeBack"}
{"text":"Came in to order take out! the waitress Sarah rang up the couple in front of me! She looked at me after she was done with them and left to go clear her table off poor customer service on her part very unprofessional! But Robert A. came apologizing for what she did he was awesome kudos to him"}
{"text":"Food was Amazingly tasty. Great value there.  Waited 28 minutes for our 2 burgers. Mind you the restaurant had 4 tables seated. It was empty. But other people came after us, ate and left. Not an explination given. When I went to pay I stood there for five minutes.  The lady (not dressed like the others so probably in charge) looked at me several times. Went about doing menial things.... then finally game over and looked at me as if I was a burden and took my money.  What a shame ... The food and value is great.  But it would have been faster to buy a calf... raise it... slaughter it... grind it... form it into a patty and make your own burger."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited for 18 minutes in the car before we got our order.  When we got home,  It was ALL wrong,.  We called the manager  thinking we might have had a mix up.  We got nothing but attitude.  We couldn't even eat what we DID get because it was soaked in grease. I filled quarter of a cereal bowl with the grease from our  2 burgers!! I would never eat that.  Why would I let my children eat that?  Bad attitude,  wrong order,  bad food.  Even Burger King tries to help you when they screw up,  not Steak and Shake on Sardis Rd., Charlotte, NC.  They will just say,  \"Oh,  really? . Is there anything else I can help you with?\"   Are you serious?"}
{"text":"Good food but shorted me a fry. This is the second time it's happened. Guess they can't handle their drive through traffic"}
{"text":"Frisco Melt is a must try together with their thin n crispy fries and finish it off with any of their milkshake"}
{"text":"I am /  was a regular customer at this location.  Usually good burgers and fries for a good price. Not tonight. Not very busy, quite few dirty tables when we sat down. No one came and took our order. We finally got up and left. When I told the cashier we were leaving due to no one taking our order all I got was a blank stare. Wow."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had steak n shake, so I popped in last night. I was very impressed.. Food order went in and was at the table in like five minutes. Everything was great and the prices were even better."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are great, but I just wish they were made in larger portions for the price you pay. Parking also sucks here, as is the case anywhere on this block. I wish they'd expand to a more easily accessible location outside of downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Visited on 2011-04-16 for a late dinner.  There was a line outside, but it moved reasonably quickly.  I ordered the spicy chipotle burger while my other half ordered the mushroom burger; good, but it didn't blow us away.  We skipped the milkshakes this time, but won't next time.  Place is very clean.  Overall, good but not great - probably because we didn't do the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Alright so I crave food from back east...This is it finally, only people bashing on this place never grew up with steak n' shake"}
{"text":"The food were pretty decent though. Ordered 2 orders of the chicken strips it was alright not really that special. But the front counter was really messy with receipts trashy and menus"}
{"text":"Worst place you could ever go to. Inside is disgusting, total employee combined IQ of less than 70 (mentally retarded). Drive thru wait is 45 min... I was the only car waiting and this was for 1 shake. Someone please close this turd down. ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE IN AMERICA. Words can't describe how much this place sucks. I could go on forever, and by the rest of the reviews I would hope everyone gets the point."}
{"text":"Two out of two burgers ordered were made wrong, but aside from that, the food is fast, cheap and easy. Decent burger. You can get a double with cheese and a pile of fries for $3.99! Tip - ask for grilled onions. There's no up charge! Good service too."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. It was not busy and we waited 45 minutes to get our milkshakes and an hour to get our food. Our waitress only made excuses instead of apologizing. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"What a joke. Was rude to us at the drive through order. Then when we pull around she said she didn't get our whole order. The workers were dancing to music and showing each other their phones. On top of having to wait forever for our food."}
{"text":"Though the shopping center isn't very appealing the restaurant was good. Our waitress was great and very friendly. Food was yummy."}
{"text":"I love Steak n Shake, but this location really let me down. We went through the drive thru around 1:30pm on a Monday. It took awhile for our food to be ready which was fine, since they make everything to order. What I'm really mad about is how bad they screwed up the order. The receipt had everything printed correctly, but the cook or bagger or whomever put our food together gave us an extra fry, and got one of our burgers completely wrong. Top it off with a milkshake that was more like 3/4 full instead of all the way, and you have for one unhappy customer. In this day and age, people who are hired to work at food establishments should be able to read a ticket, and place the correct items into a bag, but apparently that's too difficult! We won't be coming back to this Steak n Shake."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! My boss took us here for lunch the second day they were open because it is his fave burger joint and since he moved from the Midwest, he hasn't been able to find one down here. I moved from MI so I can relate. Even though we went on the second day they were open and the place was a little packed, the service was fast AND friendly. I got the regular cheese burger and fries meal for $3.99 with a Mint Choco Chip shake that was to DIE for. There is nothing to say about the food other than you can't beat it. Burger Who? and forget McDonald's--I'll never ever eat there again! I have to be honest, I can't wait to go back.  We ordered four meals and two shakes all for under $30! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!  Great experience, great environment, great location (although parking leaves a little to be desired), and AMAZING FOOD! Go here. Order anything. You'll be happy!"}
{"text":"As fast food goes the quality is good, freshly made, and staff is friendly. Service can be slow and checking out at the counter can take a ridiculously long time.  The place is always busy and open 24 hours.   It's also inexpensive."}
{"text":"The people that work here are always really nice and helpful!  I can't remember one time I came here and didn't get great service.  Even when we would come in there while they were super busy they still made it a point to check up on us and make sure if we were ok.  I'm kinda picky when it comes to particular things and we also have individuals with food allergies in my group and they are always understanding.  I can't say I hesitated to give them a full 5 stars because the times I've gone to this particular restaurant I've had a pleasant time.  The food is cheap, tasty and the service is great.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"It's fast food so it is what it is . With that being said the bathroom was filthy, the grill needs se serious see cleaning on its exterior.  The manager began talking to an employee about a diarrhea scenario.  When I sat down the waitress asked \"Do you want to eat here ?\" ?  Must have been an omen   When I was almost finished the waitress just gave me my check so I ordered my shake when I went to pay (whatever) . The menus are dirty also . No surprise that went I googled this place it had mainly negative yet hilarious reviews  .oh well, I guess what else do you expect for a $4 meal and half off shake. Seriously though smh"}
{"text":"These guys were so nice to put up with me, I had no idea what I wanted to order, and different toppings from different burgers sounded really good, so I asked the cashier what she recommended and she said I could just order the cheaper burger and add the toppings I wanted from the more expensive burger and it would be cheaper!! So of course I did this! And it was absolutely flipping delicious. Usually substitutions and additions will cost you more, but they were willing to give me some wiggle room on the price and give me the best of both worlds- in reference to the sandwich, if i remember correctly It was a burger on toast with bacon and an egg and some different cheeses and it was biblical. I would pray to that burger. What really impressed me was how patient and helpful the staff was to someone who needed some extra attention to have a good experience. I know I'm not the easiest customer to deal with all the time, so when I'm taken care of, I take note and appreciate it. Many business lack this kind of professionalism, but not this place! And it's on Mill Ave! I couldn't work on mill ave and maintain composure like these guys, I have a low tolerance for college crowds and  public inebriation. Just enough tolerance to go to steak n shake, eat a delicious meal, and go back home. Stay strong, steak n shake workers, stay strong. I love you."}
{"text":"i love chili dogs. i have had them from a lot of different places in many states but i got to say this about yours they are the nastiest  i have ever had. one would be better off buying a pack of dogs and a can chili and that would taste a lot better for sure. a very disappointed customer will not be back"}
{"text":"Good product at a fair price, but this \"to go\" of fries (see photo) was seriously lacking - at least half empty, and no, I hadn't eaten any! Really dirty kitchen (floors and stainless steel) and restrooms not great (garbage overflowing), dining room ok except for floor that hadn't been mopped in a long time. Same problem getting seated as others have had. Good l'il burger w/portobellos but I would NOT return to this location."}
{"text":"We always come to Steak N Shake when we're craving burgers and we literally live on the other side of town (NW/Centennial area), usually everything is great but this recent visit was terrible. At least at the end. When we went to divide our orders the cashier was really rude. She questioned our orders like it was our fault they put them together. My friend accidentally got a milkshake put on her order & when we told her it wasn't supposed to be there she said \"so you DONT have milkshakes?\" & gave us attitude. Then when we paid she kept sighing like she was annoyed. When she saw that I grabbed a \"how was your experience\" number she looked down at her name tag & took it off!! Then when my other set of friends paid she instantly turned her frown around. Usually it takes a lot for us to complain but this was a terrible cashier. Couldn't take her name down but we got a picture."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain.  I've never written a yelp review before this.  NEVER go to this place!  We waited in the drive thru line AT THE SPEAKER for a full 25 minutes.  Nobody in front of us.  The kid on the drive thru mic welcomed us when we pulled up  there... and then we waited.  About 8 minutes later he said he'd be right with us.  A few moments later he came out and smoked a cigarette about 10 feet from our vehicle.  He went  back inside and we waited some more.  People behind us honked their horns about a dozen times.  At one point a woman who was 3 cars back got out of her vehicle and approached my car.  I got out and explained to her that we hadn't even ordered yet.  We arrived about 20 minutes before happy hour was over.  By the time we actually ordered it was past 5pm.  We explained to them we had been in line for so long and they said we were out of luck.  We were charged full price for the entire order.  We got home and the food was TERRIBLE.  I ordered the 5 way chili.  It was cold.  It wasn't just warm... it hadn't sat out too long... and I'm not exaggerating at all.  It was CHILLED.  The noodles had obviously come straight from a refrigerator and they forgot to heat it up.  The French fryes were so old that they were chewy.  Again... not exaggerating at all!!!  There are so many great places to eat within a 1 mile radius of this place.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"The hostess looked like she was going straight to clubbing right after her shift. The food was warm and drinks were mixed up. I do like this company but this location needs major training and maybe some new cooks. We also noticed that a waitress played with her hair and then touched plates without washing her hands."}
{"text":"Just terrible; waited about 5 minutes before the greeter even acknowledged us. Waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken, 15 minutes later still no drinks delivered. Server busy on her cell phone instead of caring 4 guest. At least 4 other tables in the same boat. Will never eat here again. 25 minutes until we even got our coke and water. The manager also had no clue what he was doing. Our food sat in the window waiting to be delivered for a very long time. Now we work in the industry and understand things happen, however this was absolutely ridiculous. Their staff need to get off their cell phones and do their job. More than 45 minutes before we even got our food."}
{"text":"Very limited menu compared to regular Steak 'n Shake restaurants and restaurant was really dirty. Gross! Never going again."}
{"text":"Let me say that I've been dining at Steak n' Shake since I was a kid in Florida. I've been to this restaurant often since they opened a few years ago. I've taken friends there and have been happy to share the place with those who have never heard of it. But this franchisee is violating their contract as of late.  I went there with my friend Friday for lunch and I can tell you it was nothing but horrible. First they brought us our shakes in styrofoam to-go cups, uh...we're dining-in here. When we complained they mostly said tough, we've run out of glassware. After that, people around us were getting their shakes in glassware. On top of this the milkshakes were horrendous. They tasted like frozen fast food product and had a very icy texture like a Wendy's Frosty. They were definitely not the hand dipped ice cream milk shakes I have enjoyed all of my life at Steak N Shake.  Then when the burgers came I took one bite and could tell it didn't taste proper plus I couldn't see any cheese. I told the waitress and she stuck her fingers in between the patties and showed me the cheese, like 3 or 4 little melted specks. I said it doesn't taste right and sent it back. She said that she would have to make another one since she stuck her fingers in it, how gracious of her, but to which I responded my appetite is lost, just take it off the bill. I tried to complain to the manager, an Indian lady named Naryet or something like that and she basically blew me off.   My friend was hungry and went on to eat his and later paid dearly for it. He called me that evening complaining of severe stomach pains and vomiting.  This franchise is cutting corners and I am sure are in violation of their contract. They have no understanding of the ambiance and mystique of the classic American burger diner that Steak N Shake exemplifies. This is what happens when irresponsible franchisees run businesses like this and the franchiser doesn't pay attention and just counts the money. I really hated to see this since living in Vegas is a far different experience from the south where I grew up. It was nice to go to that restaurant and feel like a little bit of nostalgia existed but it's gone."}
{"text":"This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this place today. Came during my lunch hour, I was surprised it wasnt full of people! Service was good, very nice cashier upfront (I believe her name was Jamie). I ordered the original double cheese n fries. Omgggg! It was delicious! I saw the burger and thought I wouldnt get full lol but its actually the perfect size. I wasnt over stuffed when done and was very satisfying. The burger was a little greasy but sooooooo delicious! The fries... I wasnt a big fan; dont get me wrong, they are good but they are really thin so they are a little on the crispier side. Im not a fan of crispy foods. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Food is VERY cheap though. The milkshakes are huge thick and yummy. Sometimes when I go here, they completely ignore you when your the only person in line. The burgers were good and the menu is pretty small. Food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there! I would go here if the service was faster and better."}
{"text":"Giving it 2 stars because our waitress was nice. My boyfriend and I went in tonight (Monday night, 1am). There were 2 tables with 3-5 people at each almost done eating. We decide to stay and order. After 25 minutes of no food there only bring us and a new table with 3 people at it my boyfriend wanted to leave. We ask the waitress what's going on and she says \"they got slammed in the drive thru\" (honestly not that many cars). We were understanding and continued to wait for 2 burgers and fries. 35 minutes goes by and the table that got there AFTER us gets their food. We left. Unbelievable. Couldn't handle how bad this place was operating. We thought the Willoughby location was a hellhole...this ones right there with it"}
{"text":"Slow service and dirty atmosphere! Definitely won't be going back. Waitress was very forgetful but most importantly kitchen and service stations were dirty."}
{"text":"This is my second and last time coming here! The wait times to place your order and to sit in the drive thru are unbelievably long!"}
{"text":"You have to try their chicken melt when here. Decent crowds"}
{"text":"This place was so dirty... I really don't know how they are still open and serving food!! The floor was disgusting... The restroom was even worse... I had a hard time keep my food down when I went to the restroom... It smelled like they never changed there mop water. This place is so bad I wouldn't let my dog eat off the floor!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always hits the spot! Amazing burgers and not to mention fantastic shakes. Onion rings are one of the best i've tasted. Clean location located inside South Point Hotel and Casino. Till we meet again!"}
{"text":"Great quality steak burgers.  Love there thin cut crispy fries.  Cheap prices.  Have not tried there shakes yet, but next time for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! Just went there this past weekend with my boyfriend and OMG their burgers and fries are so YUMMY!!. and the chili cheese fries are BOMB! and love the milkshakes!! Everything we ordered was great, service was good and the prices are AWESOME!! For both of us it was less then $20!! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We are used to going to Steak 'n Shake back in Missouri when we vacation there--it's one of our favorite places back there for the food and prices. So we were rather excited to find this one in Las Vegas. But while the food was what we were expecting, the prices were a bit higher and the staff (all of them--hostess, server, cashier) could have been more welcoming and friendly. And imagine my surprise when they said that they don't participate in paying with my Steak 'n Shake app which means I didn't get \"credit\" for the meal I purchased there (supposed to be $5 reward for every $50 spent). And the prices were about 25% higher than in Missouri as well. I will have to say that for the 25% extra the amount of fries seemed a bit more generous and my wife's taco salad seemed larger as well. So if you crave the Steak 'n Shake food, you can go here for your fix. But you should be aware of the shortcomings of this particular location."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I have ever eaten here.  We went through the drive thru which took forever.  I ordered a hamburger and onion rings.  The hamburger did taste kind of odd but I figured it was because I am used to Wendy's .  exactly 6hours later I was so sick.  Might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange.  I dont think that I need to go back to this particular location......ever"}
{"text":"Crazy long wait for a Midwestern staple. I'm glad we found some yummy comfort food on our way out of Vegas but the wait s so long I don't think I'd go back to this location.   Steak n shake is a burgers, fries and shake joint and is retro goodness. They have every burger you can dream up and some delicious side by side shakes. If you aren't into burgers the chili 5 way is the way to go."}
{"text":"I don't think it's too much to ask that if you advertise your drive thru being open 24/7. Then it should be open 24/7. I work a late night job. The past three times I have tried to get food late night I haven't been able to. Twice they greeted me in the drive thru and never got back to me after twenty minutes so I drove away. Tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed. Really? Awful location. Awful service. Went inside to try to get food, but I was ignored by the staff. How hard does it have to be to get a burger? Don't go here."}
{"text":"First me and my brother walked into the building and the lady just said  bathroom for paying customers  only when i barely walked in i left due to her rudeness in tone but then ended up returning due to other businesses being closed came in paid for my meal reluctantly  and my brother received  a order number thing when he ordered  and i didn't  then the food doesn't  have any flavor at all  i literally  put a few packets of salt and lots of ketchup  on the burger and it helped bring a little taste to the flavorless  burger but not enough . After i sat down i saw a few people walk in and use the bathroom without even paying for anything and they weren't  even told anything  at all which got me pretty  upset . I work fast food and have  never seen a place this bad and the ketchup machine really needs updating i almost broke it due to lack of patience with this business first time and never coming back again. I recommend rally's  instead of this place anyday even Rallys  worst service is better  then this and their food actually has flavor"}
{"text":"I travel in and out (get it?) Of Las Vegas every year. But I always make a stop here at Steak and Shake. It's inside a casino. Be prepared to walk a little ways to your destination. The parking structure helps for people just getting off the highway.  The service is always top notch here. I got a Frisco melt and a chicken burger with Bleu cheese with fries and two shakes. I brought my friend here. He's a huge food snob. And He was blown away. We had a great experience even though we had gotten our food through the take out window. A nice lady named Ashley had helped us at the window.  My friends were nicely (and lightly) salted.  They weren't greasy or heavy with oil. My shake was perfect, not too thick. My Frisco melt was delicious. I wouldn't expect any less.  My experience at the location is always great. Speaking from experience, I've been a returning customer for about three years."}
{"text":"I try to go to this location each time I visit Vegas and that has been about 10 times since this location opened. This is the western most location in the U.S. and closest to my hometown in CA. What I like most about Steak n Shake is that it is between a sit down diner like Denny's to a great fast food burger joint like In N Out. The problem with this location is that it is always busy. Both the take-out and dine-in line is always long and I have waited no less than 20 minutes each time. The crazy thing is that I always try to come at off-time hours like 2-4pm. This time while I waited in line I saw that as tables were cleared/cleaned and ready for new customers, it would take the hostess an additional 5-10 minutes to seat people. Often times there were 3 tables empty and it was just a slow hostess. In her defense, I think they are very short staffed at this location and always have too few employees to customers.  After 20 minutes we were seated and since I had been here many times, I didn't even need to look at the menu...I knew exactly what I wanted. My server came within 2-3 minutes and said that she would be right with us. It was another 5 minutes before she came. After ordering, the food took another 20 minutes!! The cooks must be short staffed as well!! Between standing in line and getting our food, it was almost 1 hour! I have been to many Steak n Shake locations in the midwest (St. Louis) and have never experienced anything like what I experience at this location.  I ordered my usual Frisco Burger and my brother had the double stack with cheese. I also ordered a Carmel Turtle Shake and a soda to go down with it. If you have never been here before, you need to know that the burger patties are extremely thin. Half the size of In N Out and 1/4 the size of Carl's Jr. If you want a burger that will resemble the amount of food in a Double-Double (from In n Out) then you need to at least order the triple stack burger! The fries that come with the burger are also extremely skinny, which I like, because they are extra crispy!   The carmel turtle shake came in a large shake glass as usual, but this time there was no excess silver blending cup! When did this change?? Budget Cuts??? You have to get a shake when you come here. It is called Steak n Shake for a reason!   Another weird thing that I have never experienced before was they kept taking chairs from our table while we were eating. We were two people, seated at a table for four. While we were eating, they took our chair to add to another table. That was fine. Then 5 minutes later they came back and took the other one too! I didn't really care, but it was very odd for them to keep coming back as we are eating.   My review must sound so negative, but I still gave them 4-Stars, because I still really like the Burgers, Fries and Shakes. In my lifetime I have been to Steak n Shakes over 20 times and I loved it every time! The service here isn't up to par, but I'll still be back the next time i'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with some friends who live in Vegas.  They asked if I've ever heard of this place and I said \"no\" so they said I should give it a try.  I was told that this is an East Coast burger chain that is expanding out west slowly to compete with the likes of In n Out.  So I thought I would give it a try to see what it was all about.  The place was really crowded when we got there so we waited in the take-out line which only had 4 people in front of us.  After looking over the menu, I decided to go with a triple steakburger with cheese.  It comes with fries and was a little more than $5 which is really cheap.  However, when I picked up my food, I could see why it was cheap - the burger is not as big as I thought it would be and there were less fries than I expected.  Looking past that, I had to try it, and I would have to say that the burger and fries were good.  Does it beat In n Out?  NO.  I do like their burgers and would definitely come back.  Oh, and next time, I think I'll try a shake because they looked really good!"}
{"text":"Service is incredibly slow. The staff is pretty apathetic about the whole thing.  Went to the drive through on a Sunday at 6:00.  They were not at all busy.  They took 25 minutes to make our milk shakes.  That was after we went in and asked if they were going to make them.  They said they had to clean the equipment if we wanted milkshakes.  I wouldn't think a place called \"steak and shake\" would be so thrown by a request for shakes.   We will never go again."}
{"text":"Drive thru order:  I was craving something fattening and delicious today for lunch, so I stopped in at Steak and Shake. My order was the Frisco Melt, which is one of my favorites, and usually my menu option of choice.   It was prepared nicely- the two burger patties were juicy & flavorful without being too heavy, as they are quite thin. The slightly sweet, tangy  Thousand Island(esque) Frisco sauce is always delicious! The sourdough bread was toasted perfectly, with just the amount of browning on the grill, and enough butter to give a nice  golden yellow crisp.   The lady at the drive thru was very nice, and seemed very  genuine. I have heard that the burgers can be greasy, but mine was not at all, and I'll be back the next time I'm craving something fattening and delicious for lunch!  ***I do not recommend going inside to dine when they are busy. The service is very disorganized & slow. There is no orderly process to take orders in a timely manner, & I have seen people complaining about this on numerous occasions, & even walking out because of it.***"}
{"text":"I ordered a peanut butter banana shake, a Sante Fe burger and chili cheese fries. My server was a sweetheart and very fast.  So if I had only ordered the shake this would be a 6 star review. However. The burger was cold and tasted like cardboard. The fries were small stringy and greasy and the chili. Wait. What chili? It seemed to be a pile of beans scattered throughout a glop of velveeta-like imitation crap. So my advice is to stick to the shakes. They are fan-Dam-tastic."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and i loved it. Although the line was long, once we got it service wasn't too bad. Our server was great food was also very tasty and cheap! Great for families!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, terrible fries.  Fries are 1.  Hard to get a thick shake at this location."}
{"text":"I can't believe how awesome these burgers are! There was a long line (Cinco De Mayo weekend) so we opted for the take out window since we were staying right next door at the Grandview. It took less than a minute to place our order and less than 5 minutes we were on our way with the best burgers and fries I think I have ever had. My husband had the Jalapeño burger and LOVED it. My son had the Mushroom burger and said it was the BOMB, I had the classic double patty and as I said it was to die for. The entire meal was $16.00 with no drinks because we were taking it back to our room."}
{"text":"Walked in at 2:15pm and left at 2:30pm with no service.  Only two other tables and they already had their food.  Store needs new management and wait team!!"}
{"text":"Banana Milkshake 2-4pm only $1.50!   One of the best options for milkshakes in fast foot.  Their Steakfrank would be my favorite item.  Please remember the white paper hat!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless its close to closing when no one is there because otherwise service sucks and they cant seem to work under pressure.   I came and ordered a simple burger and fries, so did the guy in front of me but his had bacon and they messed both of our orders up. They made his quick and he left while i continued to wait another 10 minutes. I was offered nothing for my wait but a paper bag to put my fries in that were previously waiting on the counter for about 5 minutes getting cold. I would say 0 stars but Yelp doesn't go that low."}
{"text":"Would not go again...I guess you get what you pay for, but I have never seen a patty this thin. Burgers were awful, chocolate shake tasted like milk, fries were ok."}
{"text":"Don't go with more than 5 people.  The hostess is too dumb to figure out how to push 2 tables together."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  We went in on a Saturday night and ordered food at the kiosk.  The food didn't come for 20 minutes, and when we asked about it we were told that there was a 30 minute wait.  We finally got our drink cups at that point, but there was no ice in the drink machines.  There was trash overflowing all over the place and the bathrooms were a complete mess.  When our food finally came it was cold and soggy so we threw it away and left.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Worst drive-thru service I have ever experienced.  Drive-thru attendant was very rude, even though we only treated her with kindness.  Had to pull up and wait as others came and went through the drive-thru.  When someone came out, they only had half our order.  The milkshakes looked like they had been dropped on the floor.  I loved this place, but it was so bad I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"This was my first stop on my \"back home in Champaign so have to hit all my favorite food places\" tour.  I love Steak n Shake, so much that I have to get it at least once every time I'm in town.  Sadly, they don't have one within 1000 miles of Phoenix yet.  The food is great, especially the double steakburger (instead of ham, they call it steak you see) platter special that also includes a generous helping of shoestring fries and cup of delicious chili (some of the best around!) To make it better, both me and my grandma ate for under $10... which is cheaper than a lot of bad fast food places.  I'm not a big milkshake person, but everyone I know loves them here as well.  Took off one star because the tomato was kind of bad and my waitress was grumpy... but the food is always great!"}
{"text":"I ate here on last weekend and thought the burgers were really good. Although... A friend and myself became deathly ill that night. If you ever had food poisoning it is not fun. I know for a fact it was from there."}
{"text":"The burger were awesome! Onion were the best and the shakes are to die for!!! The burgers are thin but between my single patty, onion rings and shake I was stuffed! Prices were great!"}
{"text":"For the price was just ok but didn't get a shake. Food was a bit greasy"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service, it took over 30 minutes to get our food and when the food came, they had messed up one of our orders. However, one of the chains representatives had been visiting for her first time that day and explained to us that she will be making drastic changes in the next few months regrading the service. She also graciously payed for our meals. Overall, the food was okay and the service was poor. Good thing we got it for free!"}
{"text":"Here are some things you should know about the Steak and Shake on Mill Avenue:  This is not the Steak and Shake \"Classic store\" with the bow ties, the drive thru, the breakfast menu, and whatever you may be used to in the Midwest. This is a \"Signature store\", which means beer, wine, faster ticket times, and the prized posession: the Signature Steakburger.  Classics don't have the Signature , and it's a 6 oz patty and takes 4.5 minutes to cook, and has red onions instead of white. Otherwise it's the same as the Original Double, with (from top to bottom) ketchup, pickles, onions, patty, tomato and lettuce. At the time of this review, you can add bacon, grilled onion, Frisco sauce, mustard, or mayo to it.  Do not walk up to the cashier and ask for \"the steakburger\", saying that shows them you failed to correctly read the menu and will assume you mean the Signature, or ask you to clarify.  Not shown on the menu but can be ordered are the single steakburger (same dressings as double), junior steakburger (no dressings), junior grilled cheese, and regular grilled cheese. Junior orders have junior fries.  There are no meals/combos, but everything implicitly comes with fries (or a chili cup). You can say you don't want fries and that shaves off some of the cost. They don't have Steak and Shake Seasoning but do have others: Cajun, Parmasean Cheese and Herbs, Salt and Vinegar, and Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper. A small fry and a regular fry mean the same thing. And a large fry is huge.  There is only one size of drink, but 2 sizes of shake. A large shake and a regular shake mean the same thing, and are the same size as the drink cup.  They know that the menu sucks and is not as good as the Classic, but that is out of our control. There is a way to send feedback to Steak and Shake corporate, and that is where your voice will be heard, not on yelp."}
{"text":"Ohhh the pain and disappointment. How can the authentic steak and shake stamp it's name on the Mill Ave location? The menu is itsy bitsy, fries mediocre and shakes tasting like bad fro yo instead of creamy ice cream. The burger was fine... just fine. This is not a true Steak and Shake experience... just another burger shop."}
{"text":"We ordered two birthday cake milkshakes that we normally love, however the last two times at this locations the quality has been awful.   Very Icy and lacking in flavor as well as full giant chunks of cake in it that had not been mixed at all.   Normally we love SnS milkshakes but this location has been awful lately.   No more visits from us."}
{"text":"An infuriatingly terrible experience. The burgers and fries were good - literally everything else was terrible, particularly the service. From waiting an incredibly long time for drinks, to having to go to the restroom to get paper towels to use instead of the napkins that we couldn't get to save our own lives, to the non-existent refills even after asking, to the tables and chairs that make it next to impossible to walk through the restaurant, everything was miserable. There is zero chance I would set foot in here again and would have to question anything from this chain based on this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"What the heck, Steak and Shake? Hardly any thousand island dressing on my Frisco melt, my husband's bacon cheeseburger was missing pickles, ketchup, lettuce AND tomatoes. Both of our fries were unsalted and there were no salt packets. And my chocolate shake was actually vanilla. Avoiding this place at all costs in the future."}
{"text":"You can tell theycould care less about trying to improve this place because of the consistently poor reviews and the fact that they don't comment on any of them or even try to apologize.  Corporate should YANK the franchise on this store (which is exactly what it is - some local trying to make a buck and doesn't know what the heck they are doing)...Likely drives a Porsche and hardly ever comes into the place or else they would know it is a total mess.  Unfortunately, they will probably close and then label Arizona a 'Poor Market'.  Please someone, build a FULL SIZE stand-alone with parking SOMEWHERE in the Valley.  This one BITES!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food and horrible staff. Do not go there unless you want to have an upset stomach."}
{"text":"This place is not speedy. I would not know how their food is.  Since I waited in line to be seated twice. Stood at the cash register and even sat myself at the counter. In several failed attempts to order some burgers. Never did get to eat. But lots of other people got seated and served food. Who came in after me. Oh well! Who needs lunch...anyways."}
{"text":"Yummy food, horrid service and completely overcrowded."}
{"text":"We make this a stop everytime we come through. Love the burgers and the fries are not bad either."}
{"text":"I love Steak and Shake and if you do too,then I recommend not coming to this location because it will change your mind.The staff is completely rude ,total attitude even when asking a simple question. The food tasted like it was burnt and when trying to talk to  manager ,I was completely ignored. Never will I return and hopefully the owner does something about this."}
{"text":"We ate at the Steak and Shake at the Southpoint Hotel and it was a horrible experience.  They do not accommodate the handicap as both me and my boyfriend are in electric wheelchairs and we couldn't get through the people or tables to get to our table.  When we finally crashed our way to our table, I asked about the \"mobile \" coupons and they don't take them. Called the manager over and she refused to honor them also. She told me to go to the \"business office\" to print them out. I told her of the problem we had getting to our table and we didn't want to go through that again getting out again and back in. She didn't care, or give me the coupon discount.  Food was so so no better than a McDonalds burger minus all the salt."}
{"text":"Worst customer service no matter what time of day. Always have to wait 10/15 minutes to get greeted, double that for food, I just walked out for the last time. The manager was on the floor performing an interview. Every table minus 5 not bused. Horrible establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good, under staffed or wait staff notont trained, wasn't given silverware or napkins  with food, came to check on me as I was finished my meal. They did discount it. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  I ordered the original with no tomato and extra pickles.  Get it back to work and I have no pickles at all! It's on the receipt so cashier did it correctly, whoever made it didn't read it and they were not busy!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \"doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers."}
{"text":"After it took everything in me to step away from my ailing mother at the hospital to get something to eat this is the sorry slop Steak N Shake in Gastonia is serving. I ask for bbq sauce she said they were out then after I inquired about other sauces she proceeds to give me the bbq sauce I requested from the start. The burger was soaked with grease and covered in mustard, fries weren't even half full and cold. This slop isn't fit to feed a animal. I returned asking for a refund the manger first has me to wait while she's writing something down and dropping fries meanwhile the establishment is full of employees. She informed me with a attitude that they don't do refunds. I ask for corporate number and she says she doesn't have one mind you I use to supervise a restaurant every manager has information to corporate, and or the DM. She was very unprofessional and takes no pride in her job. Nobody asked you to work fast food so therefore Boss up and leave the attitude at home. Your providing me with a service and I should be satisfied. If I respect you respect me bc my attitude can go to explosive in seconds"}
{"text":"Great food and service. It's funny when people only write reviews when they are not happy. I like to also leave a good review when one is due."}
{"text":"A friend recommend I try this place because it's a favorite of hers from childhood. It was the first place we went to when arriving to Vegas. The meat patties are delicious! I had the patty melt with garlic parm fries, I was definitely pleased!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for a shake and burger. The shakes are absolutely amazing!! Lots of different varieties and flavors. Reaaaallly good. The burgers are ok at best. Real thin patties. All in all I'll definitely go back for some shakes."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else here. The attempts at making a good franchise smaller and lighter have essentially cut out everything that made it good.  Limited selection and mediocre... Everything."}
{"text":"Affordable fast food. Great for Kids. Kids eat free on Saturday and Sunday. Milkshakes are tasty and hot brownies with ice cream are scrumptious, love the desserts. Today's visit was poor had hair on my burger, hence the 3 stars. Overall good fast food."}
{"text":"Came here two days this week at 6:30am. Both times we were left at the drive through microphone and then at the window with zero service.  The first time we went Kathy stated that \"they couldn't open the freezer to cook food\".  The second time (which is at this moment) we had to call into the store to talk to someone. We saw someone through the drive through window (which was Kathy) and she simply waved.  Kathy (again) told us that she couldn't take our order because \"she had nobody else there to help her\".  When I tried to explain to her that we have been there twice in three days and have received poor service she simply hung up the phone.  I'm beginning to think that Kathy is a smart mouth , ignorant , piece of trash who doesn't deserve to have a job. She is certainly someone who I do not want handling my food after this experience.  This place needs to get staffed correctly, get rid of trash like Kathy, or simply close.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Visited this place while in Vegas. Food was pretty good. I am from Philly so anything close to a good burger while not at home has me. I am not a fan of shoe string fries so that was not a favorite. While they were extremely  busy , packed was an understatement, I felt they need to maintain the cleanliness of the counter and prep area a little better. Either get more help or assign someone to care for these things during peak hours. An establishment where the prep and counter area appears unkept is not appetizing and makes me wonder about where my food has been."}
{"text":"The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, I was not greeted for at least 10 minutes. The manager in a purple shirt looked at me 3 times, but did not seat me. Finally I was seated, but then was forgotten. I was seated at 13. I know that because the servers were arguing over who wanted my table. Ladies, dont be so obnoxiously loud while by the drink station. I felt so completely unwelcome and humiliated. My 2 year old son started to cry and kept repeating \"drink!\" which after 25 minutes we still had not received. When I was shot a bad glance from another server, I was done. I picked up my son and left the restaurant. Worst service Ive ever had in my life."}
{"text":"1. Absolutely amazing food. One of the best burgers I've ever had!!! 2. Incredibly low prices for the amount of amazing food you get  3. They offer lettuce wraps, which is awesome because I have celiacs.  4. Incredible customer service!!  5. My boyfriend had a probably with his burger and the manager Elijah went above and beyond to resolve the situation, apologized. And even issued a refund.  6. I would recommend this place to any and everyone.   Thank you again to the manager and the staff, will recommend this place to all of my friends and family!!!! Will be back soon !!"}
{"text":"Come on guys u got the best food in town, but ur workers are rude and unfriendly. There was woman(old woman without front teeth), she was extremely rude with me she even didnt say a word when she was paying for my food and when she gave my food she slammed the window angrily i dont know why she was angry at me i dont even know her. Overall, 4 stars for food and -3 for attitude"}
{"text":"Good food but nothing overwhelmingly fantastic. My family and I ate here last night and ordered a good chunk of the menu. Everyone was satisfied and it was really affordable for a large family. We also ordered a shake but it wasn't that good. Overall good food and I'd come back again"}
{"text":"I went here last Friday on my way to California. The wait at lunch time was about an hour and I just wasn't impressed.  There seemed to be a lot of staff just standing around and not much food was coming out.  Our meal took forever to arrive and my chicken sandwich was over cooked.  The place reminded me of a glorified diner.  It's not a place worth driving out of my way for as I live on the opposite end of town.    It was good to try once just to see what the hype was about, but it didn't do it for me.  While the waitress was friendly, she wouldn't stop talking....put in the order already!!"}
{"text":"Giving steak n shake 5 stars but the waiter we had was a whole different story... omg he was so annoying .. he asked us at least 5 times if our food was alright an kept asking if we needed anything else... not only that but he was basically rushing us to eat, pay an get out. Yeah, I'll be back but on his day off lol"}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good but the french fries are horrible. Service is good would suggest dinning rather than drive thru"}
{"text":"We came to eat really quick and the service was horrible. We ordered a lemonade with our burger on the self service kiosk because not a soul was near the register, then we got our food and the ketchup dispenser was empty, then when the food came they said our lemonade would be right up. Ten minutes later, I go up and ask and no one had even made it! We finally get it about 5 min later after our food is gone, and it is like water. This place was awful. We won't come back."}
{"text":"I just want to inform all the people looking to eat at steak n shake.  The burgers are thin, ( which for me is a plus, since that's how I like them.). So if your looking for more meat, try ordering a double or even a triple steakburger.   I personally am not a fan of the shoe string French fry, but when paired with chili bowl there OK.    The chili is very yummy I give it 5 stars ( the main reason I eat here) its a bean and meat chili, very simple and tasty.    And my boyfriend loves the shakes, the reason he eats here with me.  I grew up in the Midwest and this is a traditional steak n shake,  they haven't changed the menu for the west.  So, I can understand disappointment when going for a burger and it looking much smaller than most burger joints.  This is just how they do.  And I'm hoping by leaving this post, before you eat at steak n shake you don't go in expecting a thick burger.    If you want a more flavor burger, try a Frisco melt ( very popular where I'm from ) or something with more sauces, toppings.    Hope my input helped.    Chili bowl fan - ;)"}
{"text":"My hubby decided to grab some lunch for me and surprise me. First time eating Steak and Shake.  Had the BBQ burger nom nom nom! Man nothing like having a slurpy burger. He also got me the chili. I'm usually the first person to say this chili sucks, but it was really good! The fries were pretty good. Overall way better than any regular burger establishment."}
{"text":"Don't Pass this place. I hate to say it but it's better than In-N-Out! Really affordable! Great service. Just like a restaurant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Slow slow service. 19 minutes since we ordered and we're still waiting on food yet.  People were seated after us have their food"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Steak and Shake. I heard nothing but good things about this place, so my husband and I drove across town to try it. When we arrived there was a HUGE line outside! We had our 2 kids and double stroller so they sat us in a booth in the corner which was perfect for us. We got the food and drinks very quickly, which is always nice. After taking a few sips of our drinks we realized that the cups were filthy! My husband wiped his napkin on the inside and got a brown residue on it. We then got to looking at the silverware, and it was dirty as well! We called the server over and she apologized and then goes on to tell us that this isn't the first time that has happened, that made me feel SO MUCH better! The manager did take the drinks off our bill and they gave us new drinks in to-go cups, but one of the cups had a hole in the bottom! At this point we didn't even want to try the milkshakes that they are so famous for. With all that being said, the burgers were still pretty good and I liked the fry seasoning, not worth going back though."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price could be a little cleaner of a place and servers are kinda slow but food is not bad"}
{"text":"My family and I are extremely disappointed in our visits to Shake Shack on our most recent visits.  In the past, their shakes were very delicious.  Now the shakes were very bland.  The ice cream was far from good.  I would have to compare it to something like ice milk.  It seemed to have crystals in the ice cream.  It also seemed that the workers did not fill the shakes to the top.  My shake was probably half shake and half whip cream topping.  Very disappointing and would rethink visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Good food, great value. I went with something more traditional \"the original double and cheese burger\". The shakes however are really good I would highly recommend the red velvet shake."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! There burgers were great, there ice cream sundaes are to die for. The service was great. We had to burger meals to kids Mac cheese's, an appetizer, and two adult sundaes and a kids sundae and ur only came to 28.00. I give it 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever Buns were old and dry No meat  Wilted lettuce This place is a terrible disappointment Awful"}
{"text":"Very good food. Two thumbs up on the cottage cheese. Unbelievable shakes. I make trips here with friends when we want to eat somewhere higher end. And Omg this food gets us HIGH. High as a kite. Laughs ensue at this restaurant. Unfortunately, I have better times at the location on Clairton blvd. We're 13 years old and love to eat fries and share shakes. We have to steal our friend's dads car to get there though. But that's how good the food is. Whatever it takes. Thank god they're open late so we can sneak out!!"}
{"text":"I definitely won't be coming to this location again. It took a good 15 minutes for the server to come and ask us what we wanted. We got our food quickly, however I got the all-American melt and it was pink so I didn't eat much of it before losing my appetite. What also didn't help my appetite was the women's bathroom which smelled of horse manure. the  worst thing was waiting for our check for 30 minutes after the server cleared our table. When we looked for her we found her in the back mopping the floor, so we had to ask a different server to get our check for us since our's obviously completely forgot we existed."}
{"text":"Just left this establishment. My family was seated promptly but then left sitting for 15 minutes without a hello or drink order even. And the restaurant was largely empty with tables uncleared. In fact our only service after being seated was to have our ketchup bottle taken to be refilled and never returned."}
{"text":"The food is typical fast food brought to your table by waiter, during the busier parts of the day the service can slow to a snail's pace so I'd advise to give yourself plenty of time! Definitely not the place to go to if you have to be somewhere in a half hour."}
{"text":"After checking into the South Point. We had dinner at Steak N Shake. Its been over a decade since I've had one of their burgers. Back in Chicago, it was a routine stop for lunch. We've tried this location a couple times before, but were always turned off by the long wait. This visit, we beat the rush and were seated right away.  I chose a jalapeno melt, but was left wishing I went with my husband's choice, the portobello and swiss burger. My melt was odd, not terribly cheesy, the jalapenos came diced on the side. The bread overpowered the rest of melt. His burger, though,  was juicy and cheesy, just as it should be. I enjoyed their thin and crispy fries and the husband enjoyed his shake very much. The tab was less than twenty bucks, not bad, for a sit down meal.   We returned the next night grabbed a bite before catching a movie. This time we went to the takeout window. It is definitely the way to go if you don't have time to wait. This time we went with the original burgers, no shake, only fries. I think dinner was about $12. Cheap and easy."}
{"text":"This will be my third time coming to this Burger joint. During all my 3 vists, I came to a conclusion, that the customer service is not too great in this location. Very unattended. For example, not once the server offered me a refill. Secondly, as soon as I received my food, the server gave me the bill already. I personally find that disrespectful. I wasn't done eating nor I was done ordering. I wanted to try the delicious shake, but I felt unwanted in this establishment. Despite the days that I gone, the place wasn't busy at all. Which I don't understand why the service is like this?  Although the food is quite declious, the service doesn't make it worth to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this one a couple times very late at night (usually after a late event or party) and the one server that works that late is usually polite. The only complaint I have is that she would disappear for a very long time and it took 20 minutes for her to even ask us what we wanted to order.  Other than that, the food was great and as always, a great value."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions. Like most Steak 'n Shakes, the food is below average to average. The service is on par with the food. What strikes me as odd is the way there is always a huge kitchen staff but the wait staff can be so slow at time. It makes me wonder how much more efficient could be. Usually, it's really difficult to flag down a server to get another drink or to even take your order. Even after your order is placed, it can take up to 20-25 minutes for the food and drinks to come out. On top of that, it feels cramped in the place. I'm not a huge fan and will only go when others want to go, but even the food isn't great. I'd prefer a burger from Zelma's or Wendy's or Chili's over Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"First time to a Steak n Shake, pretty impressed. Establishment was fairly clean, food and shakes were great.  Only slight complaint: Fill up the ketchup bottles! We had to shuffle around a couple tables before we found one with anything in it."}
{"text":"We are a fan of Steak n Shake.  especially during happy hour when all drinks are half off including their shakes.  This Steak n Shake is in the South Point Casino on the casino level towards the back.  The line was LONG.  We waited for about 40 minutes before we sat down.  The smaller the party, the quicker you get seated. If you are a party of two, your wait is minimal. We had a party of 6 so we had to wait a while.  Other than the line, this place is easy to get to.  The parking lot in front of the hotel had lots of parking spaces and the hotel is HUGE.  They must have a lot of conference space which we didn't see which also explains their large parking lot AND their large parking garage on the side of the hotel."}
{"text":"I love Steak 'n Shake, and it's always my \"Go to\" place. The food is great, the servers are extremely nice, and it's just a laid back atmosphere. Not to mention, the service is pretty quick!  I guess the only cons to it are: 1. The food accuracy could be improved. Meaning, the past 4 times I went there I ordered my taco salad with NO TOMATOES, and each time, I got tomatoes. One time I got my salad with tomatoes and no taco meat. (It IS called a TACO salad isn't it?) I think I've just settled for tomatoes since I always end up getting them anyway.  2. The drive-through is kind of slow, and I always feel extremely rushed even if there isn't anyone behind me. I think they can slow down a bit..."}
{"text":"This is a place I will not go to again. Had very poor service. And staff very unwilling to help. This  place made me pay for something I didn't order."}
{"text":"LOVE Steak n Shake! Live about 1 mile from the south point casino and visit this Steak 'n Shake at least once a week!   Never had any problem with the friendly staff, I'm a picky eater and tend to make my orders more difficult than most haha sorry!  However they always get my order correct with no problems!  Usually get the double n cheese or western bbq along with a shake! Strawberry banana is by far my favorite! Oreo mint cookies n cream is also very good!  Btw! Half price shakes mon-fri 2pm-4pm :D"}
{"text":"Even though it's in the casino, it's the same as normal Steak n Shakes. Chili 3-way was great."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week. Usually, the line is pretty long, but I must've gone when it was slow because we got seated right away. The bf ordered the Frisco Melt and it was delicious! I ordered the Slider Trio (I chose A1, Chipotle, and Frisco) and it was pretty good, but my favorite was the one with the Frisco sauce. That sauce is pretty amazing. Another plus, the fries are cut pretty thin so they crispy, just to my liking. Unfortunately, I didn't try their shakes, but I definitely will next time!"}
{"text":"This Steak n Shake is located inside The University of Nevada, Las Vgeas.   College students need food that is quick and easy. Burgers are always the go to fast food for students, but not when it take forever to get the food. I get that they are trying to be freshly cooked burgers, but it takes a least 30 mins for the food to be served. I will say the workers are organized and hard-working to make our meals.  They do not serve the full menu because of their limited kitchen space. Their burgers are not as good as the Steak n Shake restaurants. It is stale, flavorless, and cold by the time it's served. The fries are also cold and stale. The best thing you can order are their milkshakes because they are made to order."}
{"text":"This place has 4 burgers on their menu that are only $4 including fries. And if you don't like any of those options, their other burgers are only about $6. The shakes are great, with many flavors to choose from. The restaurant stays open until midnight on weekdays and 1 am on weekends. Servers are friendly and food was quick. It's nothing fancy, but definitely satisfying and a fantastic price. For .50 cents more, add  flavored seasoning to your fries. I had the herb parmesan seasoning and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Let me down but the burger was good. My best friend raved about this place since she tried it in Indy.  I was truly let down by the shake.  I have had a better shake at Jack-In-the Box.  Do not ever plan on trying this place again."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've maybe ever been to.  The outside was filthy with trash all over.  The inside was maybe worse, trash and dirty.  The employees were awful, rude, slow and not caring about a thing.  I can't even guess how unsanitary it might be.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Awful in every category. The service is the worst I've ever seen. We were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the manager came over and seated one couple. Then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down. We were still being ignore until I told him it was alright we didn't need a table and left. I don't know how corporate keeps this place open. I've complained numerous times but it never does any good.  Take the extra 20 minutes to drive to the South Hills location. Its pretty much the exact opposite of the Waterfront. The food comes out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff."}
{"text":"Nothing for the non farm eater. The veggie sandwich they do serve is too salty to taste anything else. Service was friendly and quick though."}
{"text":"Steak and Shake is an establishment, no matter the setting.  For me, it has been ever since I was a teenager because they were the best 24 hour place to hang out... not to mention the fact that their shakes are fantastic, and their steakburgers are delectable.  This time I got the Turtle Carmel Fudge Sippable Sundae, and wow is that great.  Good job, their milkshakes are a good benchmark for chain restaurant desserts, they are great.  And, now they have these 4 meals under $4, its a steal of a deal, I got a double steakburger with cheese and fries, and a great shake for $8 (not incl. tax or tip)  It is a great deal!"}
{"text":"The service sucked, went on a Sunday night it took forever to get seated in a Vegas restaurant ON A SUNDAY!!! It was horrible.  And our server was so un attentive, she would only come by twice the whole time we were there. And she kept saying that our milkshakes were in the way, but me and my family noticed that people who arrived after us were already getting their milk shakes and we were still waiting for ours to come.  Then when our food arrived the burgers and fries were EXCELLENT, but our shakes still have yet to arrive.... So after we finished our burgers and fries the waitress gives us our check but we still did not have our milk shakes. And when we finally get them the shakes were horrible, it was gooey and frozen not like any other milk shake I have ever tried... Basically the shakes and service is why I am only giving 1 star....  I will not be coming back, people just go to in n out its cheaper and the burgers and shakes are amazing, and the service is way better"}
{"text":"If I could give these people 0 stars I would. Worse service than McDonalds. I went through the drive thru placed my order and told to pull up behind the other pulled up vehicle (concrete median is the reason I didn't leave since I was stuck behind the other car. I waited nearly 25 minutes pulled up until I got out the car and went inside. Cashier told me the order was not put in and told to wait while she made it. Of course the order wasn't even right. There were so many employees (I saw at least 6 just in my line of view) yet only like 4-5 tables. Half the restaurant was cleared and the chairs were up on the tables. I can't believe I had to wait nearly 40 minutes at a supposed \"fast food restaurant.\" I highly regret going there. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food we've tried is ok. It's the milk shakes. I'm not sure how they're preparing them but they taste like PLASTIC. Disgusting, we no longer order milk shakes from this location. My daughter attends a high school nearby & other students have said the same thing."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing! I'm so glad I tried them in Vegas! The meat is thin and has crispy edges.  The lettuce, pickles, and onions are fresh. Fries are delicious, thin and crispy. Yummy shakes! Definitely a must eat place."}
{"text":"Average burger, old fries, and a sad excuse of a milkshake.   Although the restaurant was super slow, the store was very dirty and the employees didn't even bother with it as they preferred to help themselves to free drinks as they conversed amongst themselves."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location several times in the past few months. I enjoy the food and shakes so I keep trying to give this location another chance, but the service is awful! The most recent terrible experience was at around 10:30pm on a Friday night, the restaurant had a couple of customers, but not crowded in any sense. We stood at the door for a couple of minutes when someone came over to take us to the table who seemed less than enthusiastic about her job. I get it, we all have those days where we'd rather not be at work, but she just seemed bothered that she had to seat us. This is the same girl who I watched wipe down our table with a wet napkin. I'm pretty sure that is not standard sanitary practice in a restaurant. We were then given our menus and waited for several minutes watching servers stop at all the other tables and even taking the time to clean other tables, but no one seemed interested in even taking our drink order. After 10 or so minutes of being ignored, we decided to just go. This was my second really terrible experience at this specific location and at this point we will not being going back. The staff just seems inexperienced or uninterested in providing any sort of customer service."}
{"text":"If you aren't in a hurry then you won't mind that it takes a while for your food to come to the table. Or for the waiter to come to take your order. My salad wasn't too bad but my husband ordered his fries to be extra crispy and they looked barely cooked at all. But the waiter was nice. It just seems this place isn't run very efficiently. But it was very crowded so apparently people like coming here. It was our first time at this location."}
{"text":"have never eaten here before, so thought we would try it...be sure to order a double or triple, as the meat is paper thin...hamburger was good, and loved the crispy shoestring fries! the chocolate shake started out good, but at the bottom, the flavor went from good to bad...a strong chemical taste appeared, which left a bitter taste in our mouths...not sure if it was the choc syrup that was going bad or what, but will never get another shake there...too bad, because everything else was good, place was clean, etc...service was ok"}
{"text":"Rename it Steak 'n Shame, because this is a Steak 'n Shake in name only! The name is reminiscent of my youth back in St. Louis, where Steak 'n Shake meant the most delicious steak burgers, awesome cheese fries, chili mac, and mouth watering shakes and malts, topped off with exceptional friendly service.   This place is wholly lacking in all of the above. If you are coming here thinking you are getting Steak 'n Shake, I can guarantee you will leave disappointed. The food doesn't taste anything close to the real deal, many of the staples like the chili mac are on not the menu, and even the shakes don't quite taste like a Steak 'n Shake should. I was happy to find the Frisco Melt on this condensed menu, but it tasted only marginally like a Steak 'n Shake Frisco Melt. My guess is the folks running this location have never experienced a true Steak 'n Shake, so food flavor and consistency is right out the window. Everything honestly tasted like it comes from an entirely different restaurant.  This was a tough review for me, because I wanted so desperately to love this place, but it's inauthentic.  I can only blame the company for allowing a phony quick-stop version of their brand to be out there diminishing what is otherwise one of my favorite places to eat. Service may be quick, but it's not friendly. In spite of the restaurant's cramped size, it's been dirty the couple of times I've visited, while the employees mill around in a poor attempt to appear busy.  Heaven forbid anyone decides to open a pale version of White Castle out here just to try cashing in on the name and reputation. This Steak 'n Shake isn't worth the trip to ASU."}
{"text":"Okay, this is one of my favorite places to get a quick (sometimes, more on that later in the review) and Very cheap meal. I get my staple triple steak burger with everything but cheese and fries for $3.99. It's amazing that you can get such an amazing value here. But it's like heaven in your mouth, it is so unbelievably good. They have many different food items that cost only $3.99 and happy hour on All drinks (50% off) as well. They also have regular gift card deals where if you by 25 in gift cards you get a free double cheeseburger meal (it varies).Now here's why it's not a five star review the service. It's always very shaky, sometimes you don't get your food correct, sometimes they forget that your in the restaurant ( me and my friends left after ten minutes of sitting with no menus), so I always order my food when they ask for drinks. I love steak and shake, so I overlook the service, but if you are never been there the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Would not seat us.  Acted like we were not there. Left and happy about it.  Drove 10 minutes to Cookout.  Better food anyway."}
{"text":"Im new to the area and my family and I wanted to try something different for lunch, so we picked steak 'n shake. We went through the drive through so we could get home and get more work done, it took 15 mins to get our food, and we orders 3 meals. The service was horrible. We first got our shakes, I ordered a Peanut Butter shake.. I received a Vanilla shake with a couple of shavings of Peanut Butter on top of the whip cream, other than that I drank a Vanilla shake. My sister ordered a Mint Oreo shake and same thing she received a mint shake with a couple of pieces of Oreo on her whip cream. After we got our food we got home starving and ready to eat! The french fries were cold with NO flavoring, NO salt NO nothing. They were the worst fries I've ever had!!! Then we get the the burgers. The bread was saggy mush and the burger were bland and gross!!! Again they were cold! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and if it wasn't for the descent burgers, I would give this place a ZERO. Very unprofessional waitstaff and what I presume to be the manager. You could hear the waitresses fighting and yelling at each other. If I wanted to listen to that garbage I would have stayed home and watched Jerry Springer. The waitresses didn't seem to care if anybody had drinks or not, and I say it this way because we weren't the only table being neglected. There was MANY. Then when we go up to pay their is a customer wanting to know when their food would be ready because they had already been there an hour and was trying to talk to the \"so called\" manager and all she did was argue with the customer and then when the customers back was turned they proceeded to talk crap about her. I waited 30 minutes for a freaking Sunday for my daughter and asked to speak to the manager but she couldn't be bothered to talk to me, I guess she had already dealt with enough upset customers. To say the least I am HIGHLY upset and will be calling and talking to a general manager in the morning."}
{"text":"Really felt bad for my server.  He seemed to be the only competent person in the whole place.  Manager let this server walk around with his iPod shuffle and headphones plugged in.  He kept pausing his music so he could take orders, and he never took the earphones out.    The locals who appear to be most of the patrons here are first class middle Illinois people.  Pretty much the epitome of all things you'd expect from hillbillies.    Food was quick, cheap, but the staff (aside from my server) was well beyond incompetent.  I felt REALLY bad for the other tables who had to wait seven minutes before the server came to their tables.  Anyway!    Steak and shake food is still awesome, and awesomely cheap. Kudos to the \"chef!\""}
{"text":"Kristin was an amazing server. Very prompt and attentive. The food was amazing and we did not have to wait long for it! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"1st visit: Tried the Melt Frisco... not much too it. I've had much better. The burger was a little mushy. A weird texture. The fries are no good. Just an overcooked pile of fries.  The shake didn't taste like great ice-cream if it is actual ice cream. Maybe i'm just a little more used to some of the better tasting establishments that serve custard. Not a fav by a long shot."}
{"text":"Not a gourmet restaurant but good food and great prices. I nearly always stop here when I'm going to and from Los Angeles; it's a reminder of food back home where this is a major chain. At the Vegas location quality can be hit or miss; but when they have the right cooks it's amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and even worse milk shakes! It took us 15 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our order and mind you we ordered 2 chocolate milkshakes.  We were annoyed but really in the mood for a milk shake so we figured the wait was OK and headed home.  When we got home we tasted the milkshakes they were HORRIBLE it tasted like they used freezer burnt ice cream.  Needless to say we will never be going back and cannot wait for cone zone to re-open in the spring!"}
{"text":"I'm a Southerner so I had VERY high hopes for the Steak N Shake since it was one of my favorite places back home... Kind of bummed. For one, they do not serve their fabulous breakfast which was my favorite meal here. I'm amazed that there is such a huge line but that's probably just because I've never seen a line at any of the other Steak N Shakes around the country. The butter pecan shake was awesome, the fries were good, the burger was okay. Love the chain but this one was not worth the 30 minute drive and hour long wait in line."}
{"text":"My love affair with Steak 'n Shake is OVER.  We were regulars, going 2-3x per month since their opening and had always enjoyed our experience, up until the last two times we've gone (the most recent time being last Saturday). The table we were seated at was filthy, as was the ketchup container that was on our table (layers of visible greasy fingerprints, as well as layers of hardened ketchup all around the outside of the cap. Disgusting.) We had to request our table be wiped down, and that we get a different ketchup container. If the seating area is so visibly unclean to customers, what must the kitchen area that we can't see be like? And then there's this: they have very obviously downgraded the product they use for their burgers. The taste has changed and not for the better. The meat now has an underlying taste and smell to the point of being rancid. I noticed it the time we ate there before this one, but thought it was just an isolated incident and/or maybe it was just my picky ass. Nope. My husband noticed it with his burger this time, too. I want to throw up just thinking about it. I have since contemplated just going there for a 1/2 price shake during happy hour but have come to the conclusion of no. Because filth."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here i expect a change in the service expecially if there is only four total people in the restaurant.. with two waiter/esses one male one female. We waited 5 minutes to be seated, 25 minutes for our food and our \"actual waitress\" never even said hello. but as soon as 3 more people walked in they were greeted,seated, and had their order taken right away. Personally working in the restaurant business as a waitress and experience at steak and shake this is not how you treat any customer. the male was extreamly helpful and sweet and i had over heard he wasn't here supposed to be on the shift currently. he has worked here for 5 years and deserves more then to have more then a cashier title. the people that enjoy their job and it shows needs to be appreciated and rewarded, and the ones that are foul need to not be dealing with people.  i am here on sunday, december 18th at 2am just incase a manger happens to review. in plans not to return again. you can teach anyone how to wipe a take or sweap but you can't teach anyone to have a good personality."}
{"text":"Finally Steak 'N Shake has come to VEGAS!   You have no idea how much I love this place. I grew up on Steak 'N Shake back home, and after every football game, or school dance everyone would always meet up here. Also they were open 24 hours so we could always grab a delicious milk shakes.   Not only does Steak \"N shake have great Milkshakes- their Frisco Melt is to die for delicious.   Oddly enough my favorite thing on their menu, is their fried chicken salad with ranch.   A salad... really..? I know! But it is amazing, instead of using croutons they use deep fried tortilla strips and everything is just yummy!   You must go here and try anything on their menu, you will not be disappointed! I promise."}
{"text":"Went to Steak and Shake last week.  The hamburgers, fries and chili were as good as I remembered some 40 years ago.  Didn't have to salt or pepper anything.  Wish they'd expand in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I love the milkshakes here,the burgers are good,and the waitstaff are friendly and hard-working and trying their best to do a good job-I also enjoy the bright decor which makes me feel like I'm on vacation-Unfortunately the management here seems to be inefficient and unconcerned about improving the slow service and chronic mistakes on orders-I have been eating inside several times a week recently and something is ALWAYS wrong-After being seated at a dirty table and served tea that was undrinkable-AGAIN!-I complained to the manager,only to be told the tea urns were supposed to be cleaned on the night shift so he wasn't responsible-LIKE I CARE!-It's easy to see why service is so slow and so many mistakes are made on the orders with such an aloof attitude from management-Just abysmal."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. There are no more kids menus or kid sized shakes. The burger patty size is similar to a junior burger at Wendy's. The menu pictures no longer remotely look like the product we received tonight. I got a melt with two patties that was no thicker than a MCD cheeseburger tonight for $8. The chicken was inedible. Two of the four shakes had chunks of ice in them. At least the food runner replaced the chicken sandwich with another menu item when complaining.   There was a wait with a double digit number of tables needing to be cleaned. That is restaurant 101. Turn your tables over. The service has always sucked but now the food does too. We won't return."}
{"text":"Generally, the food and service is better than two of the other area Steak 'n Shakes I've patronized.  The food is an excellent value, typically hot and tasty. I usually find coupons that come in the mail or Sunday paper that save a few dollars per meal.  Today, it took a little longer than normal for our food to come out. Compared to the other Steak 'n Shakes, it was typical - but not for this location. My wife and I didn't complain or even ask where our food was because of their past, fast track record. Hey, everyone has a bad day once-in-a-while - right?  When we went to pay our check, the manager apologized for the slow service without us even  complaining. She took off $5 from our total along with the coupons we redeemed.  I wish all managers recognized unhappy customers don't always complain about poor service... they just don't return or they share negative reviews on review sites like this as well as their social media channels.  We will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"Very nice people and decent food. Especially for the price. A little slow to bring the food and it isn't always the cleanest."}
{"text":"Burgers were great for the price, but don't expect a whole lot more than average.  I love the vibe of the place and the 50's diner feel to it.  French fries were very stringy, but I guess some people like them better that way.  More hash brown fries than anything.    Waitress was no fun at all and seemed to be at the end of her shift as she was very quick to take our order and didn't check back to refill drinks or see how our food was.  Bottom line is, it's an interesting little place that is not a bad restaurant after a movie or a concert at South Point.  I would not recommend making any kind of special trip to check it out though."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place and we had only seen them when in the they were only in the Midwest.  So when we were driving through Vegas and saw a sign for one we had to stop.  They did not disappoint, the food was good, the service was great, and as always the shakes were delicious.  It's a great place to grab a quick meal or a sweet treat."}
{"text":"My husband is from Indiana and there are a great deal of these Steak N Shake Restaurants out there. Every time we are out there, we make sure we make a stop out there. When we heard that they opened one in Vegas a few months ago and knew we were going to vacation there, we had to go!  Steak N Shake in Vegas is located in the far corner of the South Point Casino by the movie theatre. Getting there we saw they had two lines. One for take out and one for dining in.Although the line looked pretty big for dining in, we made it in at a good time. Only took at most 15 minutes. After waiting in line, we sat down with our menus and to entertain our toddler, she was given a Steak N Shake hat, a car you put together and a childs menu with crayons.   The food is pretty consistent with the other Steak N Shakes I've been to and it did not disappoint. My hubby ordered a Double Steak burger with cheesefries. Steak burger was juicey and cooked full of flavor..Made to order for him as he likes his plain with only cheese and ketchup. Yeah..not a whole lot but still tasty! Their crispy thin fries smothered in cheese sealed the deal with him. Every bite he was in pure heaven! He also ordered the Butterfinger shake that just made it even better!  I ordered their Frisco Melt..Basically a juicy steak patty on sourdough bread with their tangy frisco sauce. On top of that had them put lettuce and tomato which compliments the sandwich well. I also had the cheese fries and coleslaw. The fries were cheesy goodness and the coleslaw was crunchy, tangy and pretty tasty. For a shake, I had a Butter Pecan shake which was totally delish! With every sip, I took in a few pieces of candied type of pecans, which made it all even better. Was I disappointed? Hell no! I was pleased with everything!  As busy as it was, the service was terrific and attentive,. He often came to the table making sure all was well and always had a full water glass. Will I be back? Whenever I get back to Vegas I will! Its affordable and yummy~! For my husband, me and my lil' girl's kids meal..as well as 2 milkshakes, it was roughly $25. Not bad! We came out of the place well fed and happy!  BTW..every day between 2-4 pm, its happy hour on all shakes! 1/2 off on all shakes! What a deal!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour."}
{"text":"Not impressed with either the food not the service. Host never acknowledged us or smiled. Told curtly to stand behind barrier and wait. Waitress was not very friendly or welcomibg.y friend ordered a bacon burger which was served with a very very thin hamburger Patty. In-n-Out makes a much better burger than this place. Fries were thin cut and ok. I order the 5-way Chili that was served in a small Childs sized plate. Not nearly enough to fill up an adult. The chili itself tasted like can chili. The shakes were good. I wouldn't recommend as there are so many better restaurants out there than this place."}
{"text":"Have to say I was super excited they opened a Steak 'n Shake close to me as I've always wanted to try but just haven't yet. With that being said I was super disappointed. The burger was tasty as well as the hot dog, tried to order chili cheese fries but was told there was no chili so just went with cheese fries that ended up being cold with two sides of cold cheese sauce, but the most disappointing item was the shake as you charge almost $5 for an already small cup but then not even fill it up. Now I know they just opened but boy do they need to work on their service. The drive thru girl was so rude that I almost said it straight to her face. You could clearly see she was irritated that she had to be at work just from her body language and then she let me sit there for about 5 minutes after taking my money before opening the window again to hand me my hot dog without saying a word then the shake that had been sitting there the whole time again with not saying a word then finally the last bag. There were about 10 other employees hanging out drinking shakes and who I assume was the manager as he was the only one not in a uniform. So disappointing as they've only been open a couple days this is the time they should be at the top of their game."}
{"text":"we arrived around 11:30pm to this \"24 hour\" restaurant. there were a few people seated inside and the drive through had a car come by every so often, but it was by no means busy. the hostess told us that they were not seating any more customers because  one of the waitresses \"didn't want to serve any more people.\" last time I checked, there had to be a valid reason to turn a customer away, not because you are too lazy to do your job! they then pushed us out the door and turned away another group that came in"}
{"text":"Totally awesome service as usual went in for lunch was seated quickly and received my drink with in minutes of ordering..hamburger was received super fast and delicious as always' I recommend signing up to receive their emails as you receive not only a free birthday burger but also buy 1 get 1 free shake coupons through out the year."}
{"text":"Went here the other night to get a shake for the kids because it was hot and they were behaving very well that day. The wait was about 15 minutes, not bad. We sat down and ordered shakes all around. My wife had vegetable soup to help her sore throat. I was not planning to get a burger that day, but saw the jalapeno burger on their menu, so I got that with a side order of onion rings. My picky son quickly asked for chicken tenders, so we got that for him. They served us some glasses of water while we waited. It took about 20 minutes for the food to show up. While our shakes waited to be picked up for about 10 minutes prior to that. My wife loved the soup, it hit the spot. Of course pictures of food will be misleading, so when I saw my burger, I was wondering what happened to it compared to the picture. The patties were very thin and only had a few pieces of jalapenos on it. Plus part, what it lacked in appearance, it made up for it in flavor. The meat was juicy with a slight crunchiness on the outside. The onion rings were outstanding. My son ate almost all the chicken tenders, which is not normal for him. He normally only eats 1-2 pieces. The fries were not bad. The shakes were extremely good and flavorful. My wife said they tasted like the shakes from her home town in Mexico. I will definitely be going to this venue again whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"I really wish I read the reviews before coming here. All of the negative reviews are true. The service is horribly slow and the servers are rude. First, she asked for our order right as she sat us - we told her we needed a few minutes to look at the menu. She didn't come back for 15 minutes. After we finally ordered, it took another 40 minutes to get our food. There were only 4 other tables of people and all of them already had their food, so not sure why it took so long. The floor is disgusting, but luckily the food was decent. Definitely not worth the wait, mess, or horrible service."}
{"text":"Wish this location was better. I always come back and try it again, and it's not usually better. Just sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes, no one ever came on to take my order. Service is always really slow. Food is usually good. If the service would improve I'd be very happy. Been trying this one for years."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out after hearing all the hype and after eating here I still don't understand why this place is so popular.  Don't get me wrong the burger (which was kinda small) I had was pretty good and the chocolate shake was delicious but were the burgers and fries worth me standing in a long ass line for 20 minutes?.. I would say hell no!  Honestly, I think In N Out and Fatburger are way better than this place and  better yet you don't have to sit in a long ass line for 20 minutes to get your food.   If you're gonna stand in line for a burger for 20 minutes that bad boy has got to be the best tasting burger outside of kobe burger which this definitely wasn't!"}
{"text":"Reasonable and affordable although their is times I can never finish on my own, sometimes the wait is worth it and over all the waiters and patient with you"}
{"text":"Went here on Halloween night, what a mistake! Seriously, I cant make this up, 40 minutes for 1 lemonade. and 1 hour for a hotdog. that's embarrassing. I know its Halloween, but come on. we didn't order a full meal here. I will say the patio was nice, great for people watching everyone in their costumes. Come on Steak n Shake, you can do better."}
{"text":"This location has 7 tables that were dirty, took 15 minutes to be seated and 30 minutes to get our food! Great food but that's it."}
{"text":"This place us worth coming to just for the shakes. My favorite is the mocha shake. The servers at night are over-worked and the wait time for shakes can be long if you are in a big group. That being said the shake us worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just so you know. They will tell you it will be a 15 - 30 minute wait at the drive thru! Swear, i just left at 2:30am, 3 cars in front of me & told to wait up to 30 minutes! Insane"}
{"text":"Went there to-night ordered milkshakes took 20 minutes to get them after receiving them two of them taste like they there been freezer burned or thawed out in the refrigerator the last time I went they gave me the wrong one I will not be back again poor service their rating ain't even been updated since August the floors look like a dumpster and smells like a dumpster"}
{"text":"Eat here!!!  Absolutely delicious..  I heard it gets packed on the weekends.  It a diamond in the rough.  Inexpensive if u are on a budget.  I purchased 3 burger plates and three shakes for only $26.  Cant believe it!!!  It reminds how the 50s was.  When times was simply!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, and great prices! They are constantly busy but their service is great . I watched a guy train someone and the things he was teaching him was really awesome and shows his customer service"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the crowds are about. This place is a glorified Burger King. Shakes are nothing special and that goes for the burgers as well. Seems way overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"This location gets he prize for worst service.  After repeated visits over two years the poor service has declined even further. This place ranks high only for consistency - albeit for bad service. We waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to approach us.    Of the five orders, four were wrong even though they were repeated.  We had to request silver twice.  And then had to again request a spoon for the chili.  The portion for the  Childs Mac was quite small.   One in our party ordered cottage cheese.  When the meals came he told us they don't carry it.  I asked what we could substitute and he was surprised that we would want an alternative side.    This isn't the first time we had the problem with cottage cheese at this location. They NEVER carry it at this location even though it stays on the menu. The meals took longer to arrive than at any other location in Georgia or Florida.  When we told our server that we wanted to order shakes he walked away.  Another server went to him to explain that we really wanted shakes.  He came over to ask if we really wanted to order.  I guess few people order shakes at Steak and Shake.    We like the chain but this location is so poor that we are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I'm a regular to the South Point and have eaten at most of their restaurants and Steak 'n Shake doesn't  meaure up to their usual standards. Wafer-thin hamburger patties, runny chili, had to eat my chili-fries with a spoon, and I'm not a fan of shoe-string fries. My chocolate shake was pretty good though. Our server was pleasant, but service was slow. In other words would rather have In 'n Out anyday."}
{"text":"We ate a full meal here twice during our stay at the Las Vegas GrandView Resort.  My hubby got the Bacon Lovers burger and I got different sliders each time.  The salt and cracked pepper french fries are so good.  Between the whole family, several different shakes were consumed and we loved them all.  I even got them to make me a custom Shake with chocolate, banana and a peanut butter cup.  Sooo good."}
{"text":"Wow, things have changed. Was not happy with my meal. Had chicken Strip and fries and Banana milkshake and the usual Cole slaw. First the chucke5strip looked like pigeon straps. Fries were over cooked. Maybe  bottom of the batch. And lastly the Cole slaw. Last time I was here it was really dry. Thought maybe was a bad batch. But again really dry. Hardly any taste to it. What happened. It's was so good before. Quality has really dropped dramatically. Used to love this place. Place needs to change up."}
{"text":"As a person who used to regular the steak and shakes when I lived in Georgia. I was beyond excited to see that there was one in Vegas.  When we got seated we waited a while to be served, our food came out wrong and on top of that everything was cold and very soggy. Highly disappointed as someone who knows what S&S should taste like, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My kids love this place so I go from time to time. My thoughts: I hate this place.  Dreadful fries. They're so thin that all you get is crunch but no potato flavor or texture. The burgers are so thin that you get zero beef flavor. The only taste you get is from the condiments that dress the postage stamp thick burger.    But here's the capper. The other night a friend and I went through the drive-in window. We each ordered a foot long hotdog. We waited 20 minutes and neither hotdog had the condiments we asked for. But even worse, they were cold. Right there In the word \"hotdog\" is the word \"hot.\" Twenty minutes, and I get colddogs?"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I had the Royale burger and it was what you would expect of a fast food type burger, but more unique (toppings wise with the egg and all).  Fries come with the burgers which was a nice surprise.  The negative:  There is no parking, just metered street parking if you can find it, since it is in a college district.    Also, this is a VERY small version of a Steak 'N Shake, so I feel that it shouldn't be called just \"Steak 'N Shake\" but perhaps \"Steak 'N Shake Express\" or something to let people know what to expect.  There were only a few burgers, hot dogs, and shakes, ... no where near a Steak 'N Shake's full menu.  This was disappointing since my husband was really looking forward to the chili 5 way and I the peanut butter banana milkshake.  :-(   Here's hoping they will put a full Steak 'N Shake in somewhere near here.  All in all, if you've never been to a real Steak 'N Shake, this is worth a try since the food is still good, there just isn't a lot of variety."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was a Steak N Shake in AZ! Made to order, thin, greasy, juicy hamburgers! One of us was in hamburger heaven and I happened to think it was really good!  You place your order and take your pager, I'm not fond of that simply because I'm a germaphobe, grab your drink, they buzz you and you pick up your order.  The hamburgers were prepared well and served very hot. They have the best fries also, thin, shoestring type.  The layout was different from other Steak n Shakes I'd been in but it was clean and they were friendly and helpful.  We got lucky with the parking but I can see where it might be a total crapshoot to find any nearby parking.   I have a feeling I'll be back. I'm glad I found it during the summer when there are a lot less students around campus!  We need more of these in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Always a good burger. Staffs always attentive. I love it when burger places have options for cheeses other than american. Great milk shakes. Sometimes the fries come out a little cold. I usually ask for fresh ones when i order."}
{"text":"Oh great, yet another craving to attempt to resist.  Steak 'n Shake!  I was surprised to be greeted at the door, seated, and waited on.  I didn't realize that this wasn't just your \"run of the mill\" fast-food restaurant.  There's actually table service.  What?  Everyone was very attentive and professional.  I even liked the decor, if you could call it that--sort of a wannabe '50s diner thing.  It was very clean too.  I liked the red/black/white color scheme.  Everyone wore a white button-down shirt and a black bow tie.  My husband had the double steakburger, which was amazing!  My chicken sandwich was eh.  I won't get it again.  We also tried a hot dog which was also quite tasty.  I like the idea that this doubles as a drive-thru, so you can get it quick and to go, or you can sit down and get your soda in a real glass.  Pretty cool.  Also, the fries weren't my favorite, but they were still hot and crispy.  Three additional highlights:   1) they offer flavor shots for your drinks!  2) they have Coke Zero. 3) the SHAAAAAKKKKEEEES! I haven't had a shake in forever.  I got the chocolate and it was just divine.  I couldn't even finish it, not because I didn't want to, but because it was so thick that it was taking too long.  We took it to go and now it's in my freezer for later.  Mmmm.  The bathrooms were also clean and spacious.  (That one was for you, Will S.  I know you love to hear about the bathrooms.)"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Food is always just warm out of the kitchen; and the fries lose heat VERY quickly! Server omitted one of our meals on her ticket(there were just 3 of us). Heard another customer opposite complaining vigoursly about food being \"over salted\"; and the manager took said food off the check. The A/C could be dialled down a notch or 3 as it doesn't help when people have to go grab a sweater from the car! The food also suffers from heat loss due to extreme A/C! Great shakes though; but seeing as that's one of their \"specialties\" you would expect this. Only OK. Wiill not be returning."}
{"text":"Cheap good burgers! Long wait at south point from time to time. But the food comes out fast. It is almost as good as IN&OUT, it is very close."}
{"text":"Unlike the other reviewer I have never tried their milkshake, so I can't comment on that. The burgers however, are really good, specially the mushroom special ones. To be more precise, I've tried both their \"Grilled Mushroom 'n' Onion Double Steakburger\" and their \"Portobello 'n' Swiss Steakburger\". In fact, this is my favourite burger place in town, which is conveniently located on the way to the Savoy 16 cinema.   And it's kind of cool to get waiter service in a burger place.  BTW the prices are reasonable. Not as \"Green street cheap\", but not too pricey either."}
{"text":"I really like the food that steak and shake serves. But it seems like the service is subpar at every location lately. I'm afraid something needs to change. No glasses were washed. Drinks were served in to go cups. There was no silverware i didnt get any until i went tonthe cashier. Too bad steak and shake has always been one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I waited 15 minutes and no one came to my table. I don't think anyone  there really cares. I could be wrong. I tried to do an online comment at the steak and shake website. However they want you to put all your information in there and I'm not interested in being contacted. I just want to let them know that nobody is paying attention in the dining room. I left and went to McDonald's across the street. Pretty disappointing I wanted some chili and a steak burger"}
{"text":"This turned out to be an embarrassingly poor dining experience.  After a 30 minute wait for a table and a prompt greeting by our waitress, everything quickly slid downhill.  Our order took forever to make it to our table, and only one of our four meals was brought to our table as ordered.  One burger was missing bacon and was sent back (kitchen error).  One was the wrong item entirely and was sent back (waitress error).  I had ordered a salad (pretty much the only vegetarian item available on the menu) and it took an extra 5 minutes to make it to the table, and at least another 5 to get salad dressing.  My wife ended up eating about 15 minutes later when her chicken sandwich was finally served.  The poor service might have been balanced by exceptional food quality, but that was not the case.  The food was fine, but far from exceptional.  My wife rated her chicken sandwich a 2 (out of 10) while my children's burgers did better at 6-7.  My salad was good, but clearly not the reason one would go to this restaurant.  Considering the wait and the poor service, the food was not good enough for us to return to this chain again.  On the plus side, my son had a mocha shake that was very good.  Considering the delays and mistakes, one would have expected the manager to at least comp the chicken sandwich that was delivered so late. And he did, but only after we called the manager over to our table and let him know that this was what we expected.  Then we had to explain it to the cashier.  Who had to call the manager over.  Who needed to key it into the register. Twice because the cashier made a mistake keying in the amount tendered.  Altogether a grueling experience.  ADDENDUM: Credit to the management for getting in touch with me after reading my feedback. They seemed genuinely concerned about our negative experience and assured me that this was not typical, and that the issues that I raised would be addressed and corrected. Two points to Steak 'n Shake for good follow-thru!"}
{"text":"Should be called Steak then Shake...got my shake after I finished my meal first experience ruined! No not really ruined. Food and shake were decent. Did the trick for a quick stop.  i was a little disappointed in hearing the \"servers\" walk about how much money they made that day in tips. But this is not a 5 star restaurant so I understand the standards.  I would choose steak and shake over Mc. Donald's any day."}
{"text":"My experience was a lot different from the other people who have posted reviews.  I stopped at this location because it was off I-71.  Went through the drive-thru, placed my order, and then paid.  I figured it was Steak 'n Shake and it would be a few minutes before my food was ready.  So I get out of the car so I can get the pills I have to take with dinner out of the trunk.  To my surprise my food was ready in the 60 seconds it took to do this.  Everything was good."}
{"text":"This is the worst steak n shake I've ever been too. Why it took me so long to write a review, I'm really not sure. I think this was just the last straw. Each time I've been here it has been disappointing but this time was just the worst. I ordered the caramel nut shake and it was literally all syrup. I understand that it comes with syrup, but when each sip I attempt to take is straight up syrup and no ice cream it gets disgusting real fast. Being pregnant I was really anticipating some ice cream and now it is just sitting on my counter as a liquid mess. I'm so bummed about this, that I contemplated on driving back to get a refund. But given that it is late I'm just going to bite the bullet and count it as a $3 loss. Needless to say, I don't know that I'll be able to return to Steak n Shake again. Thank you, West Park location for forever ruining it for me. 'm not sure if it's just this location or Steak N Shake as a whole, but the quality has really gone down. I actually do remember a time when Steak N Shake was appealing every time, and the Ice cream was always like gold. Perhaps the management at this location is at an all time low. I also almost forgot to mention the time my husband and I came here and ordered a frisco melt during a late night. We opened it up and it was like a soggy sponge flapping. It was pretty awful. I guess it is just Steak n Shake after all."}
{"text":"We are staying at the hotel and got in late-ish on Saturday night. After we got to our room we searched out a place where we could feed ourselves and our son. We glanced through the hotel binder and my husband said,\"let's go to Steak and Shake.\" So we wandered down to the restaurant which was hopping at 830pm. It took about 15 minutes for us to get seated but that wasn't horrible.  Our waiter was a bit slow to come to our table. He did have a couple large parties so that is probably the reason. My hubs got the sliders, my son the steak dog and me the guacamole burger. The place at a Johnny Rockets feel and in the last few years Rockets has been sliding into ick with food. So I wasn't expecting much.  Our food arrived and then our shakes (which were only average). Our son went to town on his hot dog (he's picky about his dogs) which is a good thing. My hubs gobbled his sliders down. My guacamole burger surprised me by being really good. The guac was nicely flavored, the cheese had a little kick and the burger had flavor! All good! Less than $30 for the three if us and we were happily full. Excellent!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to a spring break trip. The girl at the register was very unfriendly. The milkshakes were runny and definitely not up to the billing they have. Tables were all dirty. Wouldn't stop again."}
{"text":"The service was really slow we sat down and it took them 12 minuets to come over and ask us what we wanted to drink that is inexcusable service the drive thru is also really slow service bottom line don't come to this steak and shake unless you you've got a lot of time to kill"}
{"text":"Customer service always sucks here. Matter of fact, it sucks at all of the locations in Champaign/Urbana. I like the food which is the only reason I continue to come to any of the Steak 'n Shakes  This location has decent parking at least. You don't have to worry about people crashing into you like on Prospect Ave."}
{"text":"Great food for the price... Awesome prices. Fries just OK... Milkshakes are great. Just next door to the Grandview at Las Vegas. Walked over every day to get food. Overall 4 because of the price food avg"}
{"text":"First time here. Probably the best burger I've ever had in my life! Almost ordered TWO!!!"}
{"text":"I realize it was busy on Sunday of the Tempe Festival of the Arts, but there should have been enough staff to cover, the bathrooms had no towels and were filthy, just like the dining room! There was not a clean surface to be found! I have not been to a Steak and Shake in years, I remember it differently...the quality has gone down from what I remember.  The food was very mediocre. Also, when I asked about the buzzer they give you which I have been handling,  the guy takes it wirh his gloves on, messes with it, gives it back and then goes back to food preparation. .. so much for the gloves!"}
{"text":"As I am sitting here 2 other people here I have all u can eat pancakes send in to get more hear from the back I just made them why should I make more I guess the reviews on here are right this place is as bad in service the food was good but we will not be back here again  and chuck the manger was rude like I did some thing wrong"}
{"text":"With all the hype, I truly thought this place would have better food. The burgers were nothing special and quite thin. The super thin fries were annoying and my  cookies n cream milkshake was a vanilla shake with some cookie crumbs on top.  This location might do ok only because its right in the middle of Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the haters experienced, but my brother and I dropped in while charging our car and had an awesome experience. We were sat with no wait, our waitress was attentive, friendly, and just wonderful. I tried the \"prime steak burger\" and had the fires as well as a side garden salad. By description it appeared to be a response to shake shack. It was fantastic. My brother tried the bacon cheeseburger with fried and a side salad, and he too reported it was really good. All I. All a total bargain. Oh, and yes, both dining room and restrooms were in shop shape."}
{"text":"Attention my fellow Yelpers...do not go to this Steak 'n Shake location.  I made the mistake of stopping at this location for lunch today and experienced something today I had never encountered in all of my years eating...no refill.  Yes, that's right, during our whole meal not one us was offered a refill, asked if we wanted a refill, unbelievable! I couldn't believe it.  The server looked at our table and had to notice that halfway through our meals basically had nothing to drink.  She also never asked if we needed anything, how was our meal...nothing.  The place was packed and she passed our table many times, so no excuse.  The only time she came back to the table was to give us to-go boxes and drop-off the bill.  When we proceeded to go to the counter to pay, the manager asked how everything was, my wife said ok, not great. The manager (if you want to call him that), didn't bother to ask why was your experience just ok, was there an issue with the food, service...anything!  No he just shrugged his shoulders and ran the bill and we walked out disappointed.   If you want top-notch service, go to the Parma location...it is a lot cleaner as well and the managers actually know a thing or two about customer service."}
{"text":"If you are craving a really awesome burger, or an authentic shake,this is NOT  the place for you! However, if you're on a tight budget and have picky kids that have no sense of taste then go for it. I got the steak guacamole burger, it was only $5.95. You get what you pay for. It was \"meh\" but it did fill the belly. Especially didnt like the skinny fries. I also ordered the chili for $1.95 and all I got were beans and pepper soup. Kid meals are $3.95 and milkshakes taste like they scooped ice cream out of a carton and put it in a glass."}
{"text":"It's dirty.  I was sat at a table that had not been wiped my plate was dirty silverware was dirty and the coffee saucer was dirty.  I remember going to Steak and Shake as a child and absolutely loving it what happened to this once great company?   CLEAN UP YOUR PLACE.  To top it off there was no soap in the men's room, I hate to assume how long that has been empty."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and in the mood for a greasy burger or milkshake, go here. But don't expect an excellent experience, it's a fast food joint.   We were seated in good time upon arrival. Table was clean as well.   I ordered the Portobello 'N Swiss burger with fries with an Oreo Mint Cookies and Cream shake.   Food took a little long but came out well. I'm not a fan of their fries but that's my personal opinion.   Some staff members were great and some were lacking manners, but overall it isn't bad."}
{"text":"Their two namesakes...steakburgers and shakes. They're both average. The shakes are nothing to write home about. The burgers are average. Honestly, their burgers remind me alot of Wendy's.  Their fries are super thin and crispy, definitely tasty. They have chili which is actually VERY good. You can get it served Cincinnati style, which means piled on top of pasta with cheese and onions. Its delicious.  They have good hot dogs, as well. 100% beef and very flavorful. Once, we got their club sandwich and this thing was awesome! We were expecting the turkey to have that waxy, flabby texture of cheap turkey lunch meat. But it looked like it was fresh sliced of a real turkey breast! Other than that, we haven't tried a whole of their sandwiches, but their menu isn't huge, either.  One thing I like about this place is that they're pretty cheap. They have 8 burger/fry combos that are just $4.00. They also always have coupons in the newspaper. They let you use any many coupons as you want. So the prices are pretty much comparable to regular fast food (or cheaper). Plus...kids eat free on weekends! As long as you order $.8.00 of foot, you get a free kids' meal. Drinks are not included but this is a nice perk. You can get apples or oranges for the kiddies, too, instead of fries.  Service is always fairly awful. The teenage girls they have working there obviously have never had waiting jobs before. You usually only see them once or twice throughout the whole meal. I have a hard time giving them a 15% tip because I know they make minimum wage and they really just take your order and ignore you for the rest of your meal. Once, the service was so awful, the manager just gave me the whole meal for free. I'm not expecting white glove service but a refilled water glass would be nice in  the middle of my meal.  This place is what it is. Its basically just fast food with pseudo-waitresses."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are amazing. Chocolate is my fave. The husband got vanilla which was good also. Would come back!!"}
{"text":"As we waited for our meal I noticed that one of the employees pants where down to his knees!  And I am not exaggerating!  I made a comment to our waitress that I was offended and that I could not believe that his boss would let him walk around in a place of business like that!  The waitress said yes we have told him many times and walked away!   She proceeded to tell him and the manager on duty! I didn't get his name or the managers wish I would of then I would filed a formal complaint to corporate!  Because when she told both of them they proceeding to give us dirty looks and stare us down!   Now mind you I had my children with me!  We actually felt threatened needless to say we will NEVER Return!"}
{"text":"I never write negative reviews on any platform but my experience here warrants it. I pull up to the drive-thru menu at 12:35am and am told that it will be \"5 to 10 minute wait\". okay, fine.. I get that they make everything fresh to order. So, and I kid you not, 30 minutes go by and I haven't even ordered. 4 cars behind me leave the drive thru line pissed off. I pull around to the cashier window wondering wtf is going on (there were 0 cars ahead of me at this point) and they ignore me for a solid 5 minutes. Someone finally comes to the window and acts oblivious as to why I am there. I proceed to give him my order and he tells me \"yeah I can't take your order here you have to drive back around\". are you f***ing kidding me? I tell him I just waited at the drive thru for 30 minutes and he has the nerve to say \"yeah I'm the only one here\" as I watch two other losers meandering behind him. there were maybe 2 cars in the parking lot and at least 2 employees and a manager on duty. As someone who has worked in the service industry, I can tell you this place is a complete joke. pathetic staff and management.  I will never give Steak 'n Shake another dollar."}
{"text":"I will never come to this story again service sucks so bad as a server my self I have never seen something so pathetic in my life I don't understand why the store is even open they need to at least up grade or something"}
{"text":"The business of burgers and shakes is such a cut-throat business. You can't be coming to the table with nothing more than mustard and ketchup in 2015. Please try and wow me next time. You are nothing special. You are the same decaying organic matter, the same as everyone else.  If you could not tell from the paragraph above, I was no where near as impressed as everyone else seems to be about this place when I visited Vegas a few weeks ago. The burgers were mundane, the shakes were kinda chalky, and the line was long. One of the very few benefits of this place is that it is reasonably priced, and that certainly is saying something considering we're talking about Las Vegas here.  All in all, I wouldn't say it's bad, it's just that there are soooo many better burgers and shake places- especially in and around Las Vegas. I think Yelp has once again done a fantastic job explaining this rating: \"meh... I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Service is horifically slow. Been there twice now, and both times orders have been incorrect. Staff is very friendly, but can't keep up with customers needs. Went with a colleague from Indiana, NOT even close to the quality of S&S out there. Manager did come over and offer shakes for compensation, but damage was already done.  Unfortunately will not be be back. Sorry folks."}
{"text":"Missing the favorite from back home in IL so bad and thrilled to find Steak N Shake here in AZ just to be heart broken that they do not serve tone of their best items here at this location!! :(... See the picture and please Tempe Steak N Shake, reconsider and add the full menu!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. The food really is amazing, and everything is kept so clean. And today my friend and I went and were given such great customer service. We ordered an extra burger to go for a friend , and when they let us know it'd be a few more minutes because they accidentally dropped it- they treated us each to a free shake!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 3 burger places. They are consistant with their product, made the same way each time, no surprises. Service is always good. The prices are great food is fresh. Only problem i have is that the meat and fries lack seasoning, but they do have salt&pepper and seasoning salt on the tables. The shakes are my lest fav menu item, dont taste like ice cream at all. But the burgers and fries are da bomb"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food generally sadly it is marred by customer service, up to and including the night manager, Dimitrius, that is horrible beyond belief. Only go here if you can ignore the stench of the nightmarish service."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because the Ultimate Banana shake was pretty damn good. Maybe we came on an off day, but the service was lackluster. The burger was ok, but the condiment distribution was off. The chili was ok, I personally believe Tommy's is better. Overall food gets 2, service gets 1, shake gets 10."}
{"text":"Although the franchise itself has a great reputation the Waterfront location has a low customer service rating in my opinion. A lot of attitude floating around from teenagers who obviously dont want to be working."}
{"text":"Glad we finally got to eat at steak and shake.  I think it's the only one out west unless you go to the Midwest or back east. Food was good and fresh. We are here before but it's been awhile. Also I think they need a new dishwashing machine. One of the forks looks badly tore up when we got it.  See the photos. Had fun trying to photograph and show how twisted up the fork was. Lol. The food was good don't forget that.  PS I got a chocolate shake for desert. It was great. Try one if you still got room in the stomach. Lol"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Grandview Resort with the family and we wanted something nearby to eat that would satisfy everyone's craving. Unfortunately, I didnt get a chance to eat here. This is a review for my inconveniencing experience with the business.   1. The website says they have ON LINE ORDERING, but this location doesn't have it.   2. We tried to order by phone for pick up.  The phone number on Yelp is the number for South Point Hotel, not the restaurant.   4. I was transferred to the restaurant and was told they do not accept phone orders."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Fries were small, cheese on the burger was hard and crusty not melted.  Burgers did not taste as advertised like a steak.  Yuck.  Not returning there."}
{"text":"This time around we had no line/wait time. I didn't waste any time ordering my favorite jalapeño crunch burger which was ready in less than 10 minutes. service was once again excellent and our burgers and fries were tasty and delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, food taste great! I love their Patty Melt (frisco melt). Second time service wasn't that great and got our orders wrong. Shakes are not as creamy but they gave a large selection."}
{"text":"I was craving cheeses burger and  fries,  but it all came out cold and didn't enjoy it at all. They look like they pre cooked patty and fries hours prior to it and not hot fresh out of grill, even the cheese stayed cold and not melted. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fries: Soggy, under-cooked, no salt Sweet Tea, NOT sweet Turkey Club, 1 little tiny sliver of tomato and a butt load of sweet mayo  Seriously need to have trained staff working the drive through at lunch.  And maybe add more tomato to your turkey \"club\" sandwich.  Is it Steak N Shakes policy to not salt the fries now?"}
{"text":"The drive through is a little slow but that's not uncommon for around here.  I sometimes go through the drive through in the morning to grab some shooters for everyone at work.  We really like the bacon, egg and cheese shooters. They are little and make you think that you are eating less of an unhealthy breakfast sandwich.  So you feel pretty good about yourself to start the day.  I noticed they had a taco salad for $3.99 on the menu and I just had to try it.  I really liked it.  It was the right size and price!!  However, the chili here has a lot to be desired.  I have had chili at Steak n Shake before and it was OK but here it was gross.  It was really thick and chalky.  Like it was heated up many, many times.  So don't order the chili from this Steak n Shake."}
{"text":"Steak and shake A place with an old school feel that is timeless. I like the price range of the food. You can't go wrong with the shakes. Haven't gone wrong yet. Sometimes the fries are too salty or half cooked. The best thing I've eaten so far is the Frisco patty melt. Small I'm size but awesome to taste. Love the crispness of the bread. Overall it isn't top rated but definitely a place of simplicity that balances well with the Las Vegas experience. I'd definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow. Slow to get food. Slow to get receipt after not giving me one to begin with. Pathetic excuse for service. Pathetic excuse for a restaraunt. Left on my second visit before getting food."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Ordered the Philly Steak Burger this time with Parmesean cheese and herb fries.   Quality : burger was very tasty. love the fries. thin cut and seasoning is just right. with a dash of the steak n shake seasoning.   Quantity : just the right amount of food to satisfy the hunger.   side note : shared a Mint oreo Shake with my step son and that was the perfect balance. not too sweet but just enough taste and chunks of cookies."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place open late after 1am. Found thus place by accident when looking for a gyro place. I couldn't let steak and shake go by since we dont have any in los angeles. Yet.  The host Natalie A. greeted me and was polite. Patient. And helpful. The food was great and hot. Got the white truffle burger and large onion rings.  To top it off i bought a container stesk and shake seasoning to take home. Thank you again."}
{"text":"I don't think you can ever leave Steak n Shake feeling hungry or as if you were ripped off. The portions are extremely generous, especially when you consider the prices. What was a real treat is how good all of the options are. Just because it's affordable, doesn't mean it's good. You won't be let down. I've been here about 4 times (we make it a point to stop in while in Vegas). I've always had something different, and havent been let down."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some yummy burgers and fries and definitely some kick butt milkshakes, this is the place for you. We came here on a late night food run and we're beyond happy as we drive home full of fries and burgers. And- they have the best onion rigs around. Suggest the Spicy chicken sandwich or any burger if you are here ."}
{"text":"Drove into Elyria for a brief weekend trip. Was hungry, and it was late, so we decided to go into Steak 'n Shake. It took a while to be seated, and it took a while to get service. But, however, it was 4/20. And, let me tell you, the clientele of a Steak 'n Shake at 11pm on a Friday 4/20 is exactly what you expect it would be. That makes up for a lot."}
{"text":"Located in the South Point Casino. It's a convenient quick bite if your staying across the street at the Grandview Resorts.  I was excited from prior visits, falling in love with their shakes, but not so much their food. I had convinced my mom to join me again talking up a storm about their shakes. Again had I just stuck to the shakes and had better service maybe I would have given them another 2 stars.   We got a large order of bacon cheese fries to split $4.79. The picture shows it off in a skillet, there was no fancy skillet. I almost laughed at what the large size portion was, looked like a side order you would get plated next to a burger. Also not to mention but the cheese was Velveeta cheese if I had to put a description to it. Maybe I expected to much wanting real melted cheese.   The service, was slow to get to our table, seemed as though tables were a grab bag and the waiters/staff eager to work and make tips were the ones that picked up tables. Guess there must have been a power struggle, or over abundance of lazy since people had to debate on whom was going to take our table.   The shakes, again I should have just stuck with what I know, darn for wanting to stray outside the box. The Chocolate Banana Shake $3.49 was awesome. Though call me a prude but I always want the stainless steel mixer that my liquid bliss is prepared in, or I'm spoiled by other places that give you both. Either way give me both, I'm not asking for much!   Shakes yay, food nay!"}
{"text":"As far as Steak N Shakes go, this location pretty much sucks because of the service.  I like this chain for a quick and easy meal but I stay away from this one.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of trying out burger joints from Bachi to La Parilla and eating into the hype and i must say this place offered a crappy little burger and fries meal! This place is no better than Wendys if not worse. The fries are pencil thin, bland and warm. The double burger and cheese took a bit and all i could taste was the condiments. It was like a subway sub where you asked yourself why you paid for the meat. It was my first time trying this place out and although everyone was nice i gotta ask why people were sitting down and waiting for this food court quality food and why are there servers here?? There are no other burger joints in the immediate area which might be the answer, but i wont be back. If you want to try this place just go to the take out window and save yourself the hassle of waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"Steak n Shake has been a place for us to go ritually before we go see a movie. Conveniently located right below the theaters, we can run upstairs to grab tickets, then downstairs for a bite to eat.   I tend to switch around what I order but it typically bounces between favs like the Jalapeno Crunch Steakburger or the Guacamole Steakburger but I've ordered grilled Portobello n swiss steakburgers, or the royale.   This time I ordered the Jalapeno Crunch which includes pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, fresh salsa, jalapenos, and French fried onions. Sounds spicy but I tend to add the hot sauce available on the table to add more spice XD (still not enough spice btw... LOL) The French fried onions adds a nice crunch to everything.   I had a mildly active afternoon so my food I ate before it disappeared fast. I was so hungry by 4pm. By the time we were ordering at 630pm, I went piggy mode and ordered a chicken fingers too.   Chicken fingers includes 3 breaded chicken fingers but i didn't think the fingers would be so small. I guess i got used to ones at Cane's or something but this is similar to what i get at work, but even then, even they give you more then 3. Honey mustard sauce is the best sauce to get ! (objective opinion) XD   Service overall is fairly decent over the past few visits. They refill waters fairly periodically which is great.   To more visits to come in the future to all those movies coming out this year ! XD"}
{"text":"This shit is ass!! Worst one yet!! Food wasn't good, horrible quality! Bread looks like it's on crack, not even soft or toasted. 2nd time & its ass.. only go if the other one is closed"}
{"text":"Soapy Shakes sounds like a terrible nickname for an old-school mafia goon, but it actually sums up several of our trips here.  I love a good Frisco Melt. It's pretty much the only reason to go there. I never stray; with a mound of their matchstick fries (the best!), I'm happy. It's just a burger with cheese and what is basically thousand island dressing, served on toasted bread instead of a bun, but it's wonderfully satisfying. This isn't food to eat frequently; it's greasy, and best consumed once in a while and late at night when you have cravings for this sort of thing.  I don't always order a shake here. Their shakes are ok but I'm usually drawn here for salt and fat. However, our friend has now had soapy tasting shakes twice now. He almost always orders a vanilla and the soap flavor seems especially prevalent. I never noticed it in any of mine, but I ordered flavors like the Dark Chocolate and Mint Chocolate Chip, which may use a different machine or something.  All in all, it's a Steak N Shake. It's not exactly haute cuisine. But, for what it is, it certainly satisfies a late night craving."}
{"text":"Located in the south point casino- went with some friends at about midnight. There was no wait. Server was very nice. We ordered 3 different burgers that came out within 10 mins. The burger itself was room temperature, like it was made earlier and just had toppings added. I requested grilled onions and those were hot, but the meat wasn't. I liked that they had shoestring fries, but those weren't hot either. It wasn't the greatest experience. I've been once before for dinner around 5 and it was delicious- everything was hot and tasted fresh. Complete opposite for late night dining"}
{"text":"Decent food at best but fair on price. The server we had who took our order was absolutely awful. Didn't get his name but he was a grown African American adult who was acting like a child when I was trying to place my order. Also left his command station to hit on a girl and try to get her number as he watched the line pile up. Won't be back anytime soon that's for sure."}
{"text":"Avoid this location.  Service is very slow.  An hour after eating at this location, my entire family was nauseated.  The staff just tried to tell us it takes 24 hours to get sick which is a  load of crap.   The other locations around Charlotte are FAR better than this one.  Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"crude crew...The place will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The obvious like common courtesy, customer service, taking the order right....non existent. you know there's a lot more \"wrongness\"going on in that place that you just don't see."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and I'll tell ya it was pretty yummy in my tummy. I can see why this place almost always had a long line of people waiting to be seated. The food is good and it's not expensive at all. I would definately recommend to get a shake if your'e going to eat here. My boyfriend and I shared a strawberry shake and it was delicious. Our total was like fifteen bucks and change. The place was clean, had nice decor, friendly staff, and spacious. We had a good time here. Something worth trying out. I would suggest going early though, to prevent waiting in line for so long."}
{"text":"Love love love their shakes!! Their fries are amazing too."}
{"text":"This by far is the worst restaurant to get service and to check out of .I complain to the manager and she didn't do anything ,didn't even take anything off my bill .We had to wait for our cheese for our fries we had to wait for pickles which we never got and I waited there 15 minutes to check out .they need to step up their game!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Back east, I've been to many Steak and Shakes thru the years.  This place is not exactly terrible, but it should have never been called Steak and Shake.  The burgers and fries do not have the same flavor.  The menu is quite small.  Original Steak and Shakes have table service with food served on real china plates.  Sorry, I'll pass this one up from now on and go to Freddy's - its more like the original SNS.  BTW, for those who claim Freddy's is a SNS knockoff, Freddy's was founded in the 1950, long before most ever heard of SNS outside of Illinois."}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere but the wait to get in is AWFULL there were tables empty just needed cleaned off. they need more help to clean tables faster."}
{"text":"Walked out.... 10 minutes passed drink order wasn't even taken!  Don't waste your time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid burger plus fries and shakes are great a good American Flashback to the past plus great prices and Kids love it"}
{"text":"This place would get a higher rating if they were 24 hours like most Steak and Shakes everywhere else. Food's pretty good though."}
{"text":"Today's visit wasn't my first visit to this location I've been here a few times and it appears to be about the same if my recollection serves me right so the three stars is for consistency. I usually order the same meal every time every location; a triple cheese burger loaded and shoestring fries the only variable is usually the drink, today I chose unsweetened tea but the shakes and malts are hand crafted, I love the half banana half chocolate (you must order the premium shakes the normal shakes use syrups for flavoring the premium use fresh fruit).  I arrived after the lunch rush so the place was in somewhat of a disarray, the service was excellent and the food was served up fresh and hot. I would return here."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the food is always good and our server was very good, her name was Rachel. Though there were several employees staffed I felt she was the only one working.   As I looked around I noticed the manager was just sitting down. Honestly just sitting. Didn't check on us, on her cell phone.  As someone who works in the restaurant industry, this rubs me the wrong way.   Will be back but only drive thru."}
{"text":"So, there is this video of a customer confronting a girl who took her credit card info and used it to pay her light bill!!!! I also had a problem when I went one morning. I pulled up to the drive thru and was told that they were unable to place my order so I had to come in. I came in and the same lady who told me to come in, left her drive thru post and went to do other things while one of the cooks had to stop and take my order!!! this is unacceptable!!! sad to say that they have lost a customer. until background checks and better employees are hired....i will no longer eat here!!!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers are great, the fries where cold and tastes old. When we arrived the only person working was the manager, the employee came in a few moments later from Starbucks. He then announces that all orders will take 20 minutes and he didn't know what kind of bottles water they had. The drink counter was dirty and no ketchup packages. The guy also looked high.  Not what I expected."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place more. The diner feel is cool and the shakes are great. We came by twice in one day. Once for dinner and once after some gambling and a show, for a late night snack and shake.   During dinner, we ordered unsweetened tea and it came to us sweetened. Our waitress was very gracious and took it back only to say that they notified her in back that was the unsweetened. No offer from \"the back\" to get us unsweetened iced tea and we had lemonade as a substitute. We ordered the frisco burger, chili deluxe (with onions and cheese), cole slaw,and onion rings. Our chili arrived without onions and cheese and we waited about 15 minutes for new chili. The onion rings were about 30 seconds undercooked but good enough. The burger was mediocre. The cole slaw was chunky, with onion and vinegar, and was quite yummy.  For our late night snack, we ordered a small chili cheese fries with onions and a chocolate cookie dough milkshake. We waited about 25 minutes for our food and, again, our order was wrong, as our chili cheese fries arrived without onions.   The wait staff were pleasant but the missteps were too many. To pay, we waited in a long line with one checkout person taking both payment and to-go orders and pickups. Overall, I will be back as several items were quite yummy. I just hope they work the kinks out and correct easy mistakes."}
{"text":"This location does not have real fruit , that I asked for in milkshake my friend was also nasty with ice chunks in it and my burger and fries I unfortunately did not like either. Macedonia location goes harder"}
{"text":"worst in the universe, its a saying among those that know coast food & beverage quality, of the lower level dining outlets.   bun not toasted, touch of mayo and red sauce, flavorless everything, service like a jailhouse. cheap low bid food, non dairy whip cream on shakes, no extra items on table to adjust my items of sauces, no return to check on anything, lots of staff, lots of big labor dollars, no mgmt.  in/out burger would be best to replace this bad choice.   your f&b needs to be replaced, as they been placed as favor for the rest of their lives.  as they owe the family."}
{"text":"I read the reviews  before heading to Steak N Shake so maybe my expectations were low but my family and  I loved it. It was affordable and super yummy. The only down side is the parking but its Mill so what more can you expect. I recommend and will definitely return next time Im in the area."}
{"text":"We now call it Shake 'n Sh** None of the SnS' in this area are worth going the trip, even if you were to live in one.  If friends suggest this place for a late night bite, I jump from the moving car even if I am driving. Ha"}
{"text":"I don't usually write negative reviews for fast food places but this drive-thru experience calls for just that. We start out by not being able to order our desired sandwich because of a \"bbq sauce supply shortage\"..that sucks so we settle for a BLT and an order of onion rings..but it get's worse. After we finally make it to the window and pay, we wait for literally 14 minutes which would be understandable if they were busy (they were obviously not). When we do receive our order we find two pieces of untoasted white bread with a single piece of lettuce, a pitiful looking slice of tomato, and bacon bits...actual bacon bits...like the kind you find in a grocery store salad bar. The 4 onion rings in the container were slimy and cold and kind of just fell apart when we tried to pick them up. We've never had great service at this location but it's the closest to our house so we usually settle..NO MORE! We will be driving the extra 15 minutes to the Prospect or Cunningham locations next time we want a delicious steak burger and milkshake. Peace out losers!"}
{"text":"Nasty a$$ restaurant. When you employ crackheads, I guess this is what you get. After screwing up our order this high school drop out of a waitress decided she was gonna talk about customers to other guests. Clean your nasty restaurants glasses, hire people who can read, and start over. Its hard to pick a worse restaurant than this, avoid at all costs. PS- If you see a crusty brown haired hag with tats coming towards your table claiming to be a waitress, its time to skirt, skirt."}
{"text":"Disappointed last time we ate here. Slow service, food not hot... just warm. Management did not care.... frustrating. Hopefully the new one opening soon will have better management."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Our waitress messed up my girlfriends and I order as well as we made a separate order to go and totally forgot about it. DON'T COME HERE."}
{"text":"Gave this place 2 tries..wasn't satisfied either visit. The service was slowly . Unbelievably slow. Place wasn't busy at all when we came in . The waitress just took her precious time walking around ..we didn't get to get refills on our drinks or anything bc she didn't come back around to our table after she brought the food out. Had to order our shakes to go at the front counter. And even those took close to 25 minutes to get . We watched a family come in and waited so long they sat themselves. And another couple come in and walked out once they stood there with no greeting for 10minutes . I would not recommend this place. Go to zaxbys next door"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars but I don't believe that's an option.   I've been here once through the drive-through and other than the fact that they were having obvious technical difficulties (the screens were locked on some Windows splash screen if I recall), everything seemed ok....just a little delayed.  The in-restaurant experience is HORRID! I mean the weirdest dining experience I've ever had kinda horrid. The one waitress who was eating at the counter and then npicking up people's food, checking people out, then eating again, the handling food....never once washing hands... Then our waitress who looked PISSED at us when taking our order and never showed any amount of expression in voice or anything....to the same waitress and another staring at us the entire time we were there from the bev station.....not to mention the fact that the empty tables (which there were more than plenty) were all filthy....I mean spilled pop and ketchup filthy.  This place is obviously run by a dult....."}
{"text":"I felt like failing at life this fateful night by consuming 1000+ calories, and this establishment for sure helped me accomplished that goal.   I ordered the Frisco Melt, which pleasantly reminded me of Jack in the Box's Sourdough Jack.  The bf ordered the Royale Burger, which is basically a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  Their fries are shoestring style, thin and crispy but nothing to write grandma about.  The burgers we had... were just burgers.  I will say this though, if you ever hear someone say \"You can't eff up a burger\" - that person is wrong.  You CAN eff up a burger.  This place though, did not.  It just wasn't out of this world.    Oh, I'm also a fiend for anything banana flavored.  Espesh banana shakes.  I ordered one from here and was sort of disappointed.  As banana-ey and flavorful as it was, it tasted too artificially sweet, in which I'm pretty sure they use artificial flavoring...  I've had better ( Joe's Farm Grill's banana shake is out of this world).  I'm just saying, if one of your specialties are shakes, then you should make 'em so that you ARE known for them.    In general, the prices are right ( about 5 bucks for a meal) and the flavor's aren't bad.  I would return if I were hungry and in the area.  It's not something I would repeatedly crave though."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what the hype was about but I'm sad to say that it didn't fully live up to it. Went with a party of 6 people, which was a mistake. I suggest you go in a group of 4 or less because their seating can't handle large groups. We had to wait for about an hour because there wasn't a available to seat all of us.   It took about 5 minutes for a waitress to come and get our drinks. The staff seems pretty nice. There were a lot of choices, all for under $10 which was the best thing for me, since I'm a poor college student. The food didn't take long but I wouldn't call it quick. I went with the 3-way chili (spaghetti with chili on top) and it was pretty delicious. I couldn't complain since it was $4. The milkshakes were good as well.  I would have given the place a 5/5 if it weren't for the darn wait and the lack of large group seating. I'd definitely come back though."}
{"text":"I love the shakes at steak n shake. I would have liked more options in chicken and more options for vegetarians. Overall a great place to grab a bite and hangout."}
{"text":"After months of hype around a location opening in Arizona, I couldn't help but feel let down. For anyone who's expecting a normal hometown experience, this 'Signature' Steak 'n Shake is not going to cut it. Imagine a Steak 'n Shake next to Terminal B36 at an Airport and this is what your walking into.  1. The menu - 1/3 the size at a normal Steak 'n Shake 2. The Steakburger and Milkshake - exactly as expected  3. The fries - come standard with this strange red spice (found out you can ask to have them plain)  I'm giving this 3 stars because of the emotional letdown. The staff was friendly, I received my order quickly and the food tasted normal except for the fries. My guess is Steak 'n Shake went with a 'Signature' option because the model generates more revenue than their traditional sit-down-and-be served locations. Well Steak 'n Shake, this may be true, but you wont be capturing my dollars again anytime soon."}
{"text":"What staying at the Southpoint so decided to grab a late night meal so we stopped @ Steak n Shake. It pretty full inside but we were seated immediately.  The prices were really good. I have the sliders and fries. I added jalapeños, cheese, and onion straws to the sliders. They were absolutely delicious. I was gonna order a shake but was too full. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Steak 'n shake not this one in particular hold a lot of memories for me. In my hometown my grandparents managed one my whole childhood. Las Vegas only has one location in south pointe casino and they are always busy, every once in a while I can sneak in and beat the line. My suggestion is get some stand alone locations. The milk shake at this place are always amazing! you can tell they are homemade and use fresh ingreedients. The steakburgers are a little small but delish and always flavorful! They have steakfranks and they are also good, I get them from time to time. I have always wished they had bigger fries, but they did improve them with adding seasoning like garlic herb wish makes them sooooo good!!! You would think instead of shoestrings they would have steak fries to go with the name..lol I will always love me some steak n shake and they do their customers right which is another plus once i got someone elses order and didn't notice til I was on the highway heading home and I called the store they send me coupons in the mail for 2 free burgers, fries and shakes that's what i call awesome customer svc!!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place, I really don't.  I have been to numerous Steak n' Shakes, and they truly are hit or miss--I don't know how they are still in business.  I actually do enjoy their milkshakes, and their burgers aren't terrible. The first time we were at this one, we were told \"I'll be with you in one minute\" at the drive through.  Seven minutes later, I had to ask if they were still there.  Then 10+ minutes at the window without ANYONE even addressing us.  I actually was calling the Steak n' Shake hotline and waiting to speak to a human in customer service while this was going on.  After nearly 20 minutes, we received our food, which wasn't even hot, and the customer service STILL hadn't picked up.  We get home and one milk shake was only half full and the other was fine.  Today, we were given the \"I'll be with you in one minute\".  After, given a disclaimer that it would be \"Fifteen minutes for a burger, is that OK.\"  I said we didn't need burgers, then, and was going to order a milkshake, but was cut off by a \"Sorry, bye.\"  Annoyed, we just left."}
{"text":"I struggle with all S-n-S, the food is always consistent, good and at a great price.  But the service is always pretty slow.  I think the layout of the shops does not help, or the fact that it is a bunch of kids that would rather be somewhere else.  That being said, it is always worth power through."}
{"text":"This place is unassuming-ly good! Burgers are great, portions are good, shakes are awesome and service are perfection even for a dinner! Did I mention their prices are so affordable and open late! overall will come back for more."}
{"text":"When they opened here in Vegas, it was a big deal. There was a line to get in for a few months and I mean a line that took about an hour or more! Since I am originally from the midwest, I had been to Steak 'n Shake before and I've always loved it.   I get the same thing every time I come here, the Frisco Melt with extra sauce on the side. It comes on sour dough bread and the sauce is kind of like thousand island. It's my favorite thing on the menu! I've even heard that you can buy this sandwich in the frozen food section at the grocery store. Um, that is amazing! Luckily, they are 24 hours so if you're craving a Frisco Melt, you could just come for a fresh one!  The best place to park if you're going to South Point just to eat, is when you are facing the hotel, park in the lot on the far left. You will enter by the sports book, go straight back and you'll run into Steak 'n Shake.  They just recently came out with an app for your phone that gives you a free shake for signing up. You link a card to the app, then when you pay the check, it keeps track of how much you spend. Once you spend $50, you get $5 credit off of the next check! They also have a birthday email promotion that will give you a free steak burger meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"My first time to a Steak 'n Shake will not probably be my last the food was not the greatest it's like anything you can cook at home. Oh the food was decent warm the female server refused to move us where it was less noisy she placed my party and I right in front of the milkshake area. Where it was hard to carry on a conversation.."}
{"text":"My goal of 2016 is to write more Yelp reviews... So here we are. My boyfriend and I just spent an hour at Target getting stuff for our new house. We were hungry and wanted to grab something quick, so we went to Steak and Shake. I would first like to note that their parking lot and sidewalks had NOT been salted... Not really the best idea considering it's been icy out for two days now. Anyways, we made it inside and it was pretty crowded. We were seated within 5 minutes of coming in. The  service was OK, nothing special. I ordered the single cheeseburger and cheese fries. My boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger and cheesy bacon fries. Our food came out pretty quickly and it was the way we ordered it (I ordered everything on my burger while my boyfriend only ordered cheese and bacon). Our food was good, I have no complaints. If you're looking for a quick and cheap bite to eat, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Great for the family and really good food! Great for having after or before movie or for just in general. Although the portion comes a little small for what you pay for, the quality is what it's really all about!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from family and friends and went this weekend to take my daughter for a birthday luncheon. I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and OMG the best that I've ever had, I think their bread/bun is freaking awesome. The only thing I didn't like is that I asked for a side of ranch for my fries and they charged me for the freaking ranch price was I thought it would be a lot more expensive but it's right along the same price of a McDonalds value meal per say. I thought the shakes were out of this world! I will more than likely be back soon lol! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out. It's weird because the boyfriend tried taking me there a couple times, and it was closed whenever we went... Until now! LOL.  I liked their burger patties 'cause it wasn't as salty as another establishment's steak burgers. Decently fresh ingredients, and the food came out quick and hot. I also had a banana chocolate shake which was up to par as far as shakes go. It was a tall glass, so I had to take that home in a to-go cup.  Service was good. The hostess had seated us in an area the boyfriend preferred, and the server checked on us multiple times throughout the meal. The cashier was also cool at the end."}
{"text":"I'm usually here late at night on my way home from work. Today it's a breakfast day, coffee and a Country Skillet. The food here is pretty good for the price, the service is even better."}
{"text":"This place is fire! It's a chain from St. Louis Missouri that has somehow graced the desolate lands of South Pointe, Vegas. You gotta know what to order, take it from the vet I'm from St. Louis : Frisco Melt add bacon, Cheese Fries, Chili Bowl add cheese, Seasoning ..use it!, Also make sure to check out the milkshakes, they are also delicious. Do yourself a favor, get the Frisco Melt."}
{"text":"I've been there late at night when virtually no one else is there and had a long wait for the food. Not the fault of the server, who was very attentive (why wouldn't she have been, the place was empty), but even still, she was very nice and apologetic about the wait, which was the worst part of the experience.  Food was decent. Better than most fast food for a cheap price, but compared to top quality burgers, they are exceedingly average. The shake I had melted absurdly quickly to the point it began leaking over the cup.  Average experience on the whole, though I'll likely go again."}
{"text":"Food, prices and service was excellent. Highly recommended. Only thing that would make this place better would be some craft beers."}
{"text":"We were staying at South Point Hotel and Casino where the Steak n Shake is at. It was late... around 12:30 and we were just coming back from the NASCAR race at the track. Not a lot of places were open and I saw the Steak and Shake is open until 1am Fri and Saturdays so we rushed over there to get a table before they closed. Even though we got there about 20 min before they closed they still took us and service was great! We didn't feel rushed or anything!  It reminds me a lot of Johnny Rockets... the only difference is they are much cheaper and I personally think they have better shakes! We both got burgers which came with fries, two sodas, and a shake to share. Our bill only came out to $15!!!   The shake was OMG AMAZING! We decided to try one the October Seasonal shakes which was Campfire Smores. It tasted eaxctly like a Smore! Graham crackers, marshmellow, and chocolately goodness in shake form! So yummy!"}
{"text":"If you love the basics, you'll love Steak n' Shake.  It's what a burger should be.  Simple, flavorful and cheap.  This is not you're average Vegas eatery, with a small dining room and fast service, the only thing Vegas is the line on Fridays and Saturdays.  The shakes are great, not super thick so that you have a small stroke while sucking on the straw, but milky, velvety and smooth. Fries are true shoe string fries, almost splinter fries but all too good.    Make a trip to SouthPoint, go back near the sports book.  That's where you'll find Steak n' Shake.  Cowboy boots optional."}
{"text":"We arrived close to them closing. While we waited over 10 minutes in the drive thru. The girls were playing with each other's hair , the guy making the milk shake entertained us with rubbing his butt against the cashier. I never was given a receipt for my credit card sale. All the while the manager is sitting outside shooting the breeze with another employee. The good part about the visit the cashier apologized for the delay. It took the same amount of time to order as it does to sit inside a wait. Hopefully they will improve their processes."}
{"text":"TOTAL sham!!! Ate this place growing up for years, and recently in the Mid-West. Had it when they got em in Denver, had it when they put it in Vegas, both home-runs!!! They failed in every aspect from their poor service to their decoy menu. Was so excited they were coming,  now I miss the Borders. Hope Julian, \"The King of Six\" puts something cool there when it inevitablly goes out. I miss Borders...  Its probably better than McDonalds but I doubt it. What a DISGRACE  to the Steak N Shake name!!!"}
{"text":"I live just down the street, and therefore get food from the drive-thru here relatively often. I'm at the point where the service (or lack there of) is too terrible to ignore, and refuse to let another 20-minute wait outside the drive-thru window ruin my day. I just left the drive-thru and, just like the majority of my visits, had terrible service in terms of speed of service and the general attitude of the gentleman taking my order. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone that wants a stress-free fast food visit, and will be looking to spend my money elsewhere moving forward."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and I was impressed being this is inside the South Point Casino. I had the chicken melt with fries and onion rings to share. Very tasty. My boys enjoyed mini corn dogs and shakes, which were very good. I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Awful!! They drenched my super-salty hotdog in so much sweet relish I almost couldn't tell how salty the hotdog was. Awful awful awful!!!!!   The cashier was nice though."}
{"text":"The line to be seated was way too long, so I made my way to the take out window (also a long line). I can't speak for the food because I was just craving a milkshake. Service earned no stars. Staff was pretty rude and had no customer service skills. Not just with myself, but to the gentleman behind me as well as the elderly lady in front of me. I got a Nutella shake, no complaints there. Had unblended bits of Nutella which added to the flavor. My boyfriend got the peanut butter cup. I guess because the menu showed Reese's, we expected chocolate. Wrong. It was a very watery awkward vanilla base that just had peanut butter cups in it. There was no taste to the actual milkshake and even the added candy didn't make it taste any better. I would still like to see what else this place has to offer, but because of my lack luster experience, I am in no rush."}
{"text":"Great burger spot. atmosphere is 50's/diner type. fries were crispy, I like the super skinny fries, nice change up from the average fast food place. I'd take their 4$ menu over any fast food place any day. The burger is really good, fresh ingredients, down right, just a great burger if you are in the mood for one. The service was quick, went there around 8pm. place was picked, got my food to-go in less than 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I am thrilled to finally see a Steak 'n Shake come to Henderson! We went to their grand opening and we were blown away at how beautiful their restaurant is. It's super clean and the food is beyond delicious! This is a great spot for couples or families too! My favorite is that they have a drive thru! Yes please!!!  Excited to have thIs fun new addition to Henderson. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Literally 30 min in the drive through ...I could have made 30 burgers in less time. ..staff looked scary. .manager loomed more scary. .place looked very filthy."}
{"text":"Steak N Shake is the best addition to ever happen at South Point Casino and the southside of Vegas. You would think that being a restaurant inside of a casino that the food will be expensive. Not at all. You can grab a full meal with a shake for about $7-$8.  Now the downside... The line outside of Steak N Shake is ridiculous. On a dinner night you'll be waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes. About an hour on weekends. Then once seated it takes about 20 minutes for your order to come to the table and they always bring your shake out later than your food. It's very noisy and all the tables and booths to sit at are bunch together so its hard to enjoy your meal with people in your face and overhearing other peoples conversations.  Overall, the place is great because of the food, the nice staff, the variety of items to choose from on the menu, and the takeout window they titled \"takhomasak\" lol. It just sucks that the only location is on the other side of town. Especially if you live in the Centennial/Aliante area."}
{"text":"I wish I would have remembered our waiters name. He was super friendly and deserved a great tip. The food was delicious. I must recommend the mint cookies and cream shake!!! They also have a take out window if you'd like to just pick up an order and eat it in your hotel room."}
{"text":"Contrary to some of these reviews, I have a had a great experience here. The Drive thru and the dining room were both fine. Service was better than most other fast-casual restaurants I have been to recently. We love the South Point location but there is always a huge line. This location had a much shorter line and the food was still great  As for the location There is access from two different lights making it easy to access. There has always been plenty of parking. Plus they have a drive thru.   If you haven't had Steak N Shake before: I love the Royale burger and the Original Double Cheese. They come with Shoestring fries. They have Coke products. And the Nutella Shake is awesome! Glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Waited 25 mint for a to-go order, took it back to work. Half the order was missing! I called told them I'm on my way back, have been waiting 20 minutes. And still don't have my missing order!!!"}
{"text":"OK went back and boy did they drop the ball. We waited 20 minutes for the food and there was hardly anyone there. They got the order wrong. The only thing I can say for them this time is that they were friendly and nice at the counter. What a bummer, I was really looking forward to going back there too :("}
{"text":"Oooooh man... I really don't want to do this, especially since Steak 'n Shake has such positive memories from my time with family back in the midwest, but this particular location is consistently bad.  Steak 'n Shake was never a five star experience, but it was never a notably POOR experience, either. I don't understand how this one can even go by the name. The menu is WAY smaller than a \"real\" Steak 'n Shake and the ice cream doesn't taste right.  I've even given this location a few tries, just to make sure it wasn't just a fluke, but no dice. I hate to say it, but steer clear. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Never again will I go to this location. Service is always the issue. Takes way too long in the drive thru, no matter what time of day and how many people are in line. Tired of incompetence in this generation of workers. Take pride in whatever you do and do it well. Management is at the top of the iceberg so they are always to blame for not up holding standards. Even when ordering a milk shake, which is all I get from there, it takes 2 people to figure out who's making it once I've paid the window attendant. Nice to see confusion on their faces."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had sliders shakes and bacon . The service was great. This is worth coming back."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the hype of this place is !!! Went with my friend who has been to the one in Atlanta and she loved it over there, not the same story here!! Service is horrible, apparently it doesn't seam like they know what there doing , it took them 20 min to take our order and that's only cuz my friend went and asked a waiter if he knew who could take our order , food was blah, I mean I could of gone to in n out and got a better meal and service , I gave them 2 stars cuz the shakes where good , THAT'S IT !!"}
{"text":"Went here twice on a recent trip to Vegas because it was so good!  Before I review the food, I have to say that the service on the first visit was much better than the second though.  The first visit, we had an awesome waitress with a great personality.  Now, I don't expect everyone to be like her, but the second time, the most of the crew seemed to be inattentive and lacked customer service skills.  The second visit, we stood at the podium for a little bit, and someone approached, but never looked at us or said anything, then walked away.  The person who I assumed was the hostess arrived thereafter, didn't greet us in anyway - just grabbed menus, mumbled something incomprehensible (which I assumed was a cue to follow her), then seated us.  We waited a while before the server arrived even though there seemed to be a number of servers working, several of whom appeared to be socializing near the kitchen.  Fortunately, our server turned out to be one of only two  that seemed to be on the ball that night.  Maybe I was just let down because the first experience was so good, service-wise.  Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the food both times!  And even though the service did now wow me the second time, the food did come out very quickly once we placed our order.  The first visit I had a hamburger, fries, and a turtle caramel nut shake.  The steakburger and fries (don't forget the special seasoning!) were enjoyable, but I swear that shake was the best I've had in my entire life!  I was in complete heaven.  The second visit, I ordered a guacamole steak frank with fries, and a shake (I can't remember which shake I had this visit).  Thoroughly enjoyed the steak frank!  I'll definitely return here during my next Vegas visit!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time in a long time because a friend and I were hungry and it was real late.  Kudos to any food establishment thats open 24/7 and they get a star for that in an of itself.  our server was friendly enough although it was kind of a long wait to be seated.  The place was packed with what I think was high school kids and they had like 2 people working the entire floor so I blame management on that.    aside from the fries and shake, the burger I got tasted like it had been in the microwave since vietnam, after having the beef shipped from Somalia.  It was a horrible sandwich and I felt sorry for the poor cow that had to give its life to be turned into whatever the hell they tried to serve me.  Its sad because I remembered liking steak n shakes food.  Maybe this was an off night for the cooks?"}
{"text":"This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.    It's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.  Just take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this store but my family waited almost an hour to get our food, which they delivered to the wrong table, which those people complained it wasn't their food, which they then tried to give it to us after it had been partially eaten and picked through. Barely an apology from the manager or waitress. Almost made us late to the Monsters game in Cleveland. We got there at about a quarter after 5 and left at 6:35 and we only ordered hamburgers and fries!!!  This was just wrong on so many levels...... and a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"While my family and I have been coming to this diner for years now, I will be the first to admit that it isn't the best place. It is a tradition to come here with my brother when we're returning from concerts in Cleveland (which happens frequently) but that's only because they are open late and relatively cheap. The food is mediocre but reasonable given the price. The shakes are always excellent, I highly recommend the cookie dough. The burgers are decent but a little small so I normally just go with a couple sliders. The $4 meal menu isn't a bad choice.   That being said, the service is normally quite unimpressive. Admittedly I'm frequently there late at night and I think it's somewhat understandable if the crew is a bit lacking in enthusiasm. However over the years I've gone there during the day enough times that I can confidently say the day crew isn't significantly better, with a few exceptions. Service can be slow without any obvious reasons as to why, and often when they do attend to you they are curt and eager to get away, sometimes borderline rude in their unwillingness to talk to you. There are usually several dirty tables which, if it's nighttime and/or they're slow, you may not see get cleaned the entire time you're there. The food is almost always quick to arrive, very expedient. However you had better hope they got it right because there's a good chance you won't see them until you're ready for the bill. Although that seems to only be an issue at night. During the day it's not unusual to see the manager walking around checking on customers as well as several waitress bustling about. At night the crew is very scarce.   I've had one particularly bad experience here that I still can't quite figure out. I went with a couple of friends. We are young and young adults have a rep in the food industry for not being good customers or good tippers, plus we visited around midnight. Aware of that fact, I always try to compensate by being friendly, understanding, and as uncomplicated as possible. Perhaps I wasn't doing a very good job of that, maybe the waitress had simply had a horrible night, I don't know. But she wasn't friendly at all, no pleasantries or small talk, simply took the order and left. When she came back with our shakes she accidentally dropped mine and spilled a portion of it on the table. At this point I'm assuming she's just had a long night and don't wish to make it any worse so I don't make a fuss. However she just says she'll get napkins and leaves. Alright, still no big deal. But as it turns out she just leaves a stack of napkins on the table for us to clean it up. She doesn't return with a new shake, doesn't wipe down the table, and I pay full price for a shake that was partially dumped out. I certainly didn't expect her to do all of those things, but I was a little appalled she didn't clean her own mess. Or if not that, offer a new shake, hell, a new cherry or whipped cream. Or maybe a discount. But not one of those things happened, and she was scarce the rest of the night. I'm hoping she just had a very rough day and that it isn't her usual temperament when dealing with customers. I still left her a tip, assuming that was the case and not wanting to make her night any worse. Still a little peeved though, I'll admit."}
{"text":"I like this place! Dont go here late though, service is slow. 2 people working a full house every time I do go late night!"}
{"text":"Good Food but could be better in my opinion. I will continue to go eat there but the lines are extremely long."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Shake taste like it's made with ice milk nothing creamy about it.  My burger was sent back twice.  The 2nd time was because it was only the top skin (if that exists) of the burger   The waitress looked at me like I was crazy and asked if I wanted something else.  With a sigh!!  I'm trying  a grilled cheese so stay tuned...."}
{"text":"Not a fan! If you want a good burger your better off at in n out.  Expensive for what you get. Burger has no seasoning, Chilli Cheese fries were awful.. Cheese was watered down and there was no chili just a few beans and we for sure thought the shakes were going to be good but those were terrible as well. Pretty disappointed in this place because their pictures on the website looked amazing but it was not good at all."}
{"text":"Don't wanna be a buzZ kill but theres really nothing good about this place service is slow food is greasy and theres only about two employees there whos worth their paycheck maybe ...1\5 star"}
{"text":"the steakburgers and shakes are reslly great, I like banana shakes and the Jalapeño Crunch or Cajun steakburgers. Staff are very friendly, the place is clean , bright and attractively decorated. It does feel a bit like stepping back into an idealized version of the 1950s. the $4 meAl deals are great!!! good root beer float also. I feel like this is a place where teenage dreams take a big step towards coming true."}
{"text":"The long line outside is extremely deceiving .. this burger joint was disappointing and did not live up to the hype.   We ordered a single steakburger, a double n' cheese steakburger, and split a cookies and cream milkshake.   Both burgers were completely tasteless. So much for the \"steak\".. the patty was so small and flattened down to almost nothing.. there was more of the bun if anything. I like thin fries but the fries that came with the meal was almost non-existent and over cooked.   The only redeeming thing about our meal was our cookies and cream shake. Not too sweet and just the right amount of creaminess.  Prices are fairly cheap, however you're better off spending you're money at In and Out where the burgers & fries are sooo much better..!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here in on our way through Vegas. There were many signs along the way advertising the place so we figured why not??   S n S located in the South Pointe Casino. Having never been there, it seems that we parked the furthest possible distance away from the restaurant so we got to fight all the smokers on the way through. Being from California, I do not miss that smoke however after walking through this place, I know feel AND smell like a smoker. Anyway, no stars deducted for us having to walk, that was our fault.   Once at the restaurant, the waiting line was medium in length but moved through rather quickly. We had a party of 7 and they ended up cramping us into a booth that was not made for that many people. I had fears of Thanksgivings past where I'd have to go the the kid table. Regardless, the seating arrangement worked out but not without some discomfort.   Service overall was ok but our waitress was a little flighty. Kept calling my daughter \"the baby\". She's EIGHT!! My friend asked for some A1 sauce and was brought an empty bottle....dead serious. To top things off the service was slow.   The food itself did not taste bad however it looks nothing like the menu. I was hungry and left the place not being quite fulfilled.  The food tasted alright however the quantity was not as it appeared on the menu.  I guess it never is.  I would eat here again if I were in the area but would never make a special stop."}
{"text":"My family and I just had food from Steak n Shake in the South Point Resort n Casino.  This was the worst  burger and fries I ever had!!! The patties are thin and dry.  The burger itself was overall DRY!!!  I had a single bbq bacon steak burger.  There was about a quarter size bbq sauce on the top bun...no sauce any where else.  My husband said \"this is a drunk meal\" the kind you don't care what it looks like or taste like.  How can you mess up a vanilla shake?  The taste was so disgusting I couldn't even start to finish it!  The fries were skinny fries that were cold before you sat down to eat them.  Never ever will we eat there again."}
{"text":"Had the signature burger... It literally was like eating a pile of salt. I couldn't even down my first bite. The fries were good and shakes were too. The service was awesome but I'll stick to the ones in the Midwest..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a greasy burger with paper thin patties and real milkshakes, this is your place. I'm giving this joint a 4-star because the grease is thick. Warning, if you are dealing with cholesterol issues or prone to heart attacks, avoid this place. But if you are desiring a juicy greasy but tasty burger this is your happy place. Come early as lunch is a mad house. The prices are decent."}
{"text":"I used to love this Steak and Shake but it's gone downhill rapidly over the last year or so. I miss how this place used to be. The first problem I had was when I was dining with my family. They got their burgers 10 minutes before I finally had to ask the waitress about mine. Apparently my order was never put in so she 'expedited' a new one. It was another 15 minutes before my food came out...however I found a sizable piece of plastic 'wrap' in my burger so I had it sent back for a redo. It took 20 minutes to redo the simple double burger!  Received no apology at all. Up until that point I'd never had issues there but since then it's been getting worse and worse. Most times now orders are wrong or incomplete. That's frustrating when you use the drive-thru to save time. I began having to check my orders every single time before leaving. I stopped by for the last time last week. Ordered the #14 double with parm fries (my usual) and what I received was a burger with only bacon and pickles. No parm on the fries either. When I parked and went inside to get it corrected I was dismissed rudely by the two cooks who I spoke with. They said my order was right without even looking at what I tried to show them out the receipt. I was too tired and mad to continue so I just took the food and left. I don't plan on returning to this Steak and Shake location."}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place, especially those from Chicago.  I decided to check it out, but I have to say that this place was only decent.    I honestly felt the place was like an East Coast version of In-n-Out, and I'm not a fan of the West Coast chain either.  Although the burgers were fresh and the patties were crispy, they lacked the overall quality that I find in places such as Bachi.  My favorite was the milkshake that I got.  It was very thick and fattening.  Nothing better in a shake!  The service was friendly without being intrusive.  Like I said, the place is decent.  The quality of food and service is good, but not great."}
{"text":"I really like their Western Burger and flavored fries! I know this Steak n Shake closed then reopened.  It seems to be a lot better now!"}
{"text":"As far as Burgers and Fries go I give this place one star.  But they deliver on the Shake so gave it and extra star for that. There is always a line and the place is always very busy.  But the food is subpar, the hamburger patties are like jerky, and the fries are soggy. Would not come back."}
{"text":"This is recommended by someone. The only best thing here is the peanut butter banana milkshake. Service was super slow, no napkin or silverware is given with our food. Our waiter did not even once check on us, which he apologized at the end but it was too late. We ordered spaghetti Mac which has too much beans and not enough meat. We also ordered Frisco melt with extra Frisco sauce with Parmesan herb fries which was cold. My son ordered chicken tenders and french fries which were also cold. I would only go there for the milkshake. The rest is not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Hmmm hmmm good eats at a great price!  The line wasn't so bad. Its really nicely decorated. My hubby, mom and I all ordered the cheesy cheddar burger, wow was it delicious. It came with shoe string fries that were good too. We ordered two cups of their chili which I am now craving. My brother ordered the bar b que burger which he liked. The good thing is that the burgers are like regular sized so you can eat everything on your plate without busting your gut.   My brother ordered two shakes and I also got a Jr strawberry shake. The strawberry shake is the best I have had.   All this food for $40, my mom had a coupon which took $15 off. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Lala was amazing! And it felt just like being back at a steak 'n shake in Indiana! Plus the food was so delicious! I missed this place so much!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see how many people has bad experiences here. My husband and I went in and ordered and we took a little longer than usual and the waitress was super nice about it ( I'm very indecisive) once we started ordering they had add ons for the fries and I of course didn't know if I would like it. So she got them for me and told me that if I didn't like them she would get me new ones I ended up liking them anyway.  It was super cheap. Our food was so so good. Didn't tske real long considering how many people were in there. Waitress always checked in on us. Made sure we had our drinks full at all times.  And instead of her just filling it up with more soda she dumped out the old ice and got brand new. (I have when i get like 2 ice cubes that are pretty much water..)  that girl was ON POINT. I didn't expect our bill to be so cheap so since she was so awesome we gave her a 15 dollar tip. On a 15 dollar bill. Overall an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Instead of seating us, these two employees decided to argue in front of customers! Didn't care what so ever."}
{"text":"Worst Steak 'n Shake I've been to, the fries were old and stale, the burger patties looked like cardboard and the Nutella shake had too much icy chunks in it. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst Steak and Shake ever.  Service is so slow that they make the Bureau of Motor Vehicles seem like speed demons."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start this review. The help behind the counter is rude, slow, and inefficient. The orders were messed up, the burgers were dry and tasteless. The french fries were cold. The best thing I can say is the Diet Coke had a lot of ice in it. If I could give negative stars it would be -2"}
{"text":"I had the worst meal at this steak & shake that I've ever had. While eating my taco salad, I found the whole core of the lettuce head and other hard leafy parts. To make matters worse, they were all discolored and brown. I plan on taking the pieces back to the store tomorrow to see if the manager would have eaten them, since no one answer the phone at the restaurant tonight. See photos."}
{"text":"Poor service no urgency horrible food. We waited 20mins for our food 10 minutes waiting to be seated.  Ordered the BLT only to receive a sandwich drenched in mayo.... how this place is still in business shocks me."}
{"text":"I fucking hate this place, they have the worst customer service and they are very rude! I've never been more upset! It was my friends birthday and he really wanted to come here but they split up our whole party! I ordered a shake and it didn't come in for 20 minutes and I was almost done with my meal, it was melted and watered down and we ordered the shake 30 minutes prior! They made me put cheese on my own burger as well as my friends that we SPECIFICALLY ordered! Don't come here, trust me!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good steak burgers, thin crispy fried and thick milkshakes. If you download their mobile app you get a milkshake free plus $5 for every $50 you spend."}
{"text":"This may be the worst milkshake I've ever had. You should be able to expect better from a place with shake IN THEIR F'ING NAME.  I wish I had read the other reviews first. This was so bad I'll never give them our any of their other locations another chance."}
{"text":"I asked for jalapeños on my burger.. didn't get them. Boyfriends burger didn't have cheese. They did correct order and the service was great (minus the long line to pay) Probably won't go back.. nothing special"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this particular Steak 'n Shake but I have at others when I used to live in the Dallas area. Fine cuisine? Don't expect it - just simple comfort food. The five-way chili (better known as Cincinnati style) is excellent, and the burgers - ahem - steakburgers do not disappoint.  Only drawback I've seen from reading other Yelp reviews is that there's only one location and it tends to get crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious! My favorite is the mushroom burger, so if you love mushrooms, I definitely recommend it! Very convenient, especially if you are staying at South Point. Their shakes are amazing and worth the price. However, I wouldn't recommend taking it to go because they give you less since it is in a to go cup. Perfect for kids and families."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after hearing about SNS opening the only store in Arizona.  Ordered the original cheese burger with regular fries, for other type of fries, you would have to pay extra for it.  The only good thing coming out of this place is probably the Coke machine where you can mix different drinks together.  Other than that, you probably get better burgers at nearby fastfood joints."}
{"text":"One of us had a craving for burgers so checked my handy Yelp app to see what was nearby. BAM! Steak N Shake was the one that Mr. B and I agreed on. It's a Midwest childhood favorite of his and I like their mid afternoon Happy Hour menu where drinks and shakes are half off!   Anytime we have visited here the place is pretty busy and not very many vacant tables but we get seated right away. The wait during mid afternoon is never less that five minutes.    Greasy burgers I kid you not!  Especially if you order the Wisconsin Buttery Burger. I justified ordering this since it's my cheat day/weekend and I deprive myself of butter laden everything lately. The burger makers must have knew that too because when I got my plate that burger was dripping in a pool of buttah! No lie! It didn't help either that the grilled onions were dripping in grease as well. Pretty much the bottom part of my bun was soaked in a combination of butter and grease. ICK .. Lucky I don't eat much bread so no loss on me. It is what it is called The BUTTERY burger, but that was bit much.   The steak burger patties are thin, seasoning wise it's MIA. Good thing for the fry seasoning by the table, I added some and it gave it a little punch to both my burger and skinny fries.  Hmm maybe that's how they're designed to be made plain, make you add your own seasoning in hopes that you'll buy a bottle (because that's exactly what I did!)   PLUS POINTS for Cloth napkins - Name a fast food chain / casual place that has them..I can't think of any.   Shakes ...they are thick, really rich. I like getting strawberry/banana. They give you plenty, I never can finish it. Happy Hours it's a bargain so it's no biggie that I waste 1/2 of my shake.   Service - This is where I have a beef! (pardon the pun) Sometimes it's great and on point, other times service is not there. Like our server this past visit. Once we got our burger order and our ticket, that was that.  We wanted to add milkshakes but we didn't see our server nor any other servers in the dining area for about five minutes.  Even the diners in the immediate area were wondering where the heck the servers were.  So MINUS points here.  Our meal for two with burgers, fries, chili  drinks and the milkshakes came just over twenty one bucks.That's pretty cheap.  It's probably why we don't mind coming here. But I'll hold off on the butter next time."}
{"text":"Oh boy. They tried. They really did. As a former server, some tips: Consolidate. Ask the whole table if there is something you need before you go back to the kitchen. The shake machine can't be as backed up as 20+ minutes per shake. As a cook, do multiple orders at the same time. Don't have the hostess cook. Apologize if the order is wrong. Pre-bus.  And above all fake it till you make it.... Even if it is a rough night try to make someone's day rather than following suit with the rest of the staff looking like you are in the seventh circle of hell.  It's burgers and shakes. Have fun with it."}
{"text":"The steak burgers are paper thin but delicious. The shakes are out of this world.  The staff great. Wife got a dirty glass and had to get another water. Ole"}
{"text":"Our server was great which made this a better visit.  The service is quick, so that too makes this a plus.  The restuarant itself was not that clean, but it was acceptable.    The main issue for the 3 stars was the food.  The burger meat is fine, but the bread on the patty melt literally disintegrated in the middle due to a sloth of butter that was not evenly spread.  The edges with no butter were dry and hard.  In other words, I ate a burger using my hands to hold the meat and threw crust to the side.  The fries were fine and they still make one of the best shakes."}
{"text":"While driving from Las Vegas to Washing D.C a few years ago I stumbled across this place somewhere in Kansas and fell in Love with it, yes, capitol \"L\" love, I really get into my food.  Fast forward a few years and I was told by my son that they were opening one in Las Vegas and I thought, well its about time.  It is hard to believe but when Steak n Shake first opened in Las Vegas the lines were an hour or two long and everybody thought well that will pass, I was back in Vegas a month ago visiting and a friend and I went to the gun show at the South Point and thought, \"hey, while we are here' lets grab a burger at Steak n Shake\" ........................... I was blown away when we had to wait in line for thirty minutes!!!  After three years of lines why is it that some smart business guy (or gal) has not opened a second, or twentieth location??????  Any way, this is good american food at a GREAT price.  Get the Original Double'N Cheese or the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger, order a side of Cheese fries (the shoestring fries are so good) and a Dr. Pepper and what you have is an old fashion, God bless America, All American meal.  All those years while I lived in Las Vegas I wished that they would build a Steak n Shake in Vegas, they did, I moved to Salt Lake City ..................... man I wish tey would open a Steak n' Shake in Salt Lake City!!!!  Until next time Yelpers ..................... Be Local, Live Local, and whenever you can, Buy Local!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for my first time. I had the jalapeño burger, a cup of chili, and a soda. Food was cooked well. Reminded me of how Johnny Rockets used to be. I also like the Colombian peppers they serve at the table. They made the chili that much more flavorful. Note that I'm a west coast guy and have In N Out as my baseline for burgers."}
{"text":"Was really excited about Steak and Shake opening in the neighborhood after reviewing the menu online was looking forward to a Cajun Burger and their happy hour when I arrive there they didn't offer the Cajun burger and they said there was no happy hour at this location everything I wanted that was on the menu they didn't have don't think I'll be returning"}
{"text":"1) I literally waited over 35 minutes in the drive-through...yea really, I timed it. 2) it took forever to order, as the man taking my order kept disappearing and I would have to keep asking if he was there. 3) they never asked what I wanted on my burger and therefore, when I did finally, by some Miracle, make it to pick up my food, my burger was naked. (Like no condiments.. No lettuce, onions, tomatoes pickles etc). 4) they forgot my fries... After... Remember waiting in line for over 35 minutes. 5) they forgot and then remembered the bacon for my burger, so they gave it to me in a separate container  6) my food was COLD... No not even room temperature. COLD. Like... The cheese had rehardend and everything sat outside in the 60 degree weather for an hour(You would think after waiting a good portion of your life for a burger and fries they would at least be hot and fresh) 7) didn't even give me any napkins. 8) this place is a complete disgrace."}
{"text":"Dirty. Poor service. Old, soggy fries. Hair on the tables. Okay burgers. Best to take out."}
{"text":"I really like the burgers at steak and shake and I'm usually drive-through person but I was shocked and appalled and disgusted to go into my steak and shake today on a Sunday evening at after 8 o'clock because the parking lot was full of trash & the front area was covered in trash... the bushes even have trash in them and to walk inside the restaurant there is even trash all over the floor especially in front of the kitchen window. It's the first thing you see when you walk in: my entire line of sight was full of trash on the ground it's disgusting! And the servers are standing there in front of the window waiting for things and are too damn lazy to reach down and pick up the trash. I've watched them all walk by or just stay in there over at doing nothing when all I have to do is reach 10 and pick up their damn mess. I ran restaurants for years and yes this is fast food but none of the other fast food restaurants like Zaxby's next-door has trash in their parking lot or in their bushes that I can see. This is bad management. And it Would appear staff Just does not take very much pride in anything they do. I hope they don't keep their homes this way.   Did I not love their jalapeño crunch burger and hotdogs they would not get three stars... Really trashy filthy and I'm watching servers or staff be on their phone sending texts in the beverage area instead of picking up all that garbage under their feet!"}
{"text":"And management allowed a worker to place her stuff all over a counter and fight with me because I took a picture of the garage sale going on in this restaraunt. This girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also. I paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way. Not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place. Feel free to contact me if you want all the issues."}
{"text":"This may be the worst Steak and Shake location in the country. We're from Florida and loved SnS there.  I've been to this location three times now because I assumed that they were just having an off day during my prior visits.   The burgers are always over cooked and over seasoned. The fries are cold. We ordered a salad and cup of chili which were brought after our meal was completed. Our to go order was wrong. The bathroom was disgusting.   On a positive note, our server was very sweet."}
{"text":"After letting the hype settle down, I decided to pay a visit to Steak 'n Shake today and was sadly disappointed. While the building and decor is somewhat nice, everything else left a lot to be desired.  The bullet points: -Steak burger was good if unremarkable. -Shake was good, though again unremarkable. -Ordered my food for dine-in, still came out in a paper bag as if I had asked for it to go.  But what is really troubling is how unclean the place feels. At ~3pm, the area between the soda machines was stained and dirty, and I don't recall seeing a single table wiped down in the half hour or so I was there. Mine certainly wasn't when I sat down, and none really seemed cleaner than another.  As has been touched on earlier, the employees seem to be the issue here, as they simply don't seem to get it. Yes, one greeted me when I walked in, but as far as keeping this relatively new place presentable, they didn't seem to get it.  Also, the dual buzzer system is confusing and somewhat annoying, though a relatively minor inconvenience. Why it's that way is beyond me; hopefully it is something gets addressed.  For my first and likely only visit to this Steak 'n Shake, I left less than impressed by this place that came with high expectations. Better to go around the corner to a locally owned institution and get a burger there."}
{"text":"Painful for the second time in a row. We went a few months ago and waited well over and hour to finally get food. Just to get someone to take an order took 20 min or so.   The whole place was a mess.  Most customers were complaining about the service and a few of the waitresses were crying behind the counter, presumably due to the stress.  I felt bad for them, because it was most likely poor kitchen staff that caused the problems.   So, before going to the movies this weekend we tried once again thinking the last visit was an anomaly.  I was wrong. We waited 25 min to place a drink and milkshake order before ordering food.  Well, the soda came eventually, but never to see the milkshakes.  I told the waitress that we had to leave because it was taking too long...almost and hour at this point and we still did not place an order for food. The waitress responded \"ok\". She was not the least bit concerned that people were not being served."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and dogs. Friendly staff and clean interior. Oh and let's not forget milkshakes. Only request: \"add malts to the menu\""}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this is Steak n Shake so I wasn't expecting much.  We just went to this location for some late night grub. We walked in to a sign that read please wait to be seated. After waiting for several minutes a customer at one of the two tables seated us and cracked a joke about the service.   After sitting alone with no menus for some time the server decides to pop up and laughed at the fact that the customer was the one to seat us. Never the less we put in an order for a couple of burgers. Looking around the only two tables with us had already eaten ...  yet strangely we had a 35 minute ticket time.   Food arrives and the manager and two employees walk out the front door. We ate quickly as we were starving and waited patiently for 20 more minutes. I got up to use the rest room and looked around ... we were literally the only ones inside !!!!!!  Pissed off I left enough money on the table to cover my tab and walked out the front door only to find the entire restaurant staff in a black sedan with the license plate HEZ 4116. Of course that was the spark our server needed and quickly ran inside to make sure we didn't stick her with the bill.   I'm writing this review in the hopes that someone with any kind of authority in the franchise can talk to the employees ... at the very least the manager ... on shift (late night Saturday March 30th) as this is a pitiful way to represent someone else's business.   Good Day."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that they don't have the full menu like other locations (e.g. salt and vinegar fries) also don't have a kids menu (e.g. grilled cheese). Decent amount of seating. Weird location. A bonus that they have a regular Coke machine and not a Freestyle (i.e. the Coke tastes right)."}
{"text":"This, hands-down, was the best, most amazing burger/shake joint I have ever been to.  It's cheaper than fast food for a burger/shake.  It's amazing.   It's amazing.    IT'S EFFING AMAZING.  go go go!"}
{"text":"Classic double cheese burger is my favorite! On my list to visit whenever I am in Vegas! Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside of South Point Hotel and Casino. I came here the last time I went to Vegas and I must say that this place surprised me on how good it was. The decor is somewhat of an old school/nostalgic shake restaurant feel. They have a $4 menu, which was pretty good and decent. I ordered the chicken tenders from the $4 menu. It came with shoestring fries, which I love! I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie dough shake. The shake was delicious! The chicken tenders were good too. Can't expect too much but definitely was what I was expecting for a simple meal.  I would recommend trying this place out if you're in the neighborhood. Good prices and good food!"}
{"text":"Horrid service!  Had adequate staff but they did not move. Saw our server for her to take order, drop off order but never again. Ask for drink refill when received meal got drinks with no ice. Asked another server for ice never saw any ice. Then got to wait for five minutes to pay the check. Overall the food was great! Service sucked!!!"}
{"text":"when will this place ever get a health score that is respectable enough to want to eat here. Again a 92, come on guys. Do love the vanilla cokes though."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment this place was. I didn't want to believe the bad reviews as I have good memories of Steak 'n Shake from going to college in the Midwest but apparently I should have.  First, lets talk about the food, it's good, but nothing special in this day and age of gourmet hamburgers everywhere you turn. I have a feeling my memories were biased by comparing these burgers to places like McDonald's, White Castle and Big Boy back in the 80's.  However, the biggest problem at this location is the way it is run.   I understand that we were there during the Tempe Festival of the Arts so I expect it to be busy, but I also expect that they will staff appropriately for the crowds and apparently that was too much to expect.   Even though there were four staff plus a manager working they told us that it would be a half-hour wait for our food. While it only turned out to be 15 minutes they were also apparently too busy to wipe down tables, refill the silverware bins, empty the overflowing trash cans, or clean the bathrooms while we were there. I'm not sure what the manager was doing, but maybe a field trip to In 'n Out Burger to see how you can handle crowds while still maintaining a neat and clean operation for the customers would be a good idea,  I'd go with one star, but at least it's cheaper than Shake Shack, so they have that going for them."}
{"text":"I love Steak 'n Shake, and tend to frequent this location quite often. I enjoy that it is open very late (possibly 24 hours?) and the service is about the same anytime I go. This chain tends to have typical slow-ish service so when we get an actual good server it is always nice to find. Nothing to hold me back from coming back though!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Had never been to a fast food Steak 'n Shake. Would have rather had a full service restaurant. But all and all it's about the food. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. It wasn't busy and I waited 34 minutes to get drive thru service. When I asked to order they gave me terrible attitude and basically threw my food at me. Trashy people."}
{"text":".  Everyone was telling me how delicious Steak 'n Shake is.  We don't have any in Seattle, so I thought I'd try this place out.  I purchased 3 way chili.  It was actually ok, howevere the 2 stars is for both the service and the fact that this particular Steak 'n Shake does not honor any of their website specials anymore.  After I paid the full price, the staff still was rude and gave me a takeout menu telling me that now I will know the correct pricing.  Too bad."}
{"text":"This place really sucks. We have been there several times with our grandkids because they like it. Food has been terrible several times had to return to get the hamburger corrected. Usually burnt. Just a bad place to eat. Maybe other Steak and Shakes are better. Don't know how this place stays open."}
{"text":"Let me first say - I feel so off-putting when I make seemingly complex requests and orders. I'm on the Keto diet which is a low to no-carb and no sugar type of diet with a focus on high fat. That being said - I ordered a bacon-n-cheese triple extreme with lettuce, extra tomato, extra pickles, mustard and mayo with an egg on top and no bun. Upon stating the order the nice lady that took my order repeated it flawlessly (great feeling & good vibes). After paying I was directed to pull ahead and they'd bring it out. It wasn't too long of a wait, but I wouldn't complain if it was because I ordered a complicated request and they make it fresh and to order. The gentleman came out, very pleasantly and friendly and said \"bacon extreme with no bun/bread\" - I said \"yes sir\". When I got home; they made it perfectly with everything in a container, extra fixings mustard and mayo on the side and with a fork and knife (which I forgot to request). The Sheffield Steak-n-Shake delivered in a big way for my today and all with pleasant attitude and care and attention. Being on such precise diets like the Keto Diet makes eating out or picking up carry out such a headache, however, my experience here at this Steak-n-Shake was uber encouraging and such a great experience - THANK YOU for showing me that there are great establishments out there that treat their customers and patrons well and go above and beyond to be accommodating. BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out.   Seating is very limited and wait times are around an hour.   After waiting for an hour to be seated, We waited another 30 minutes for a server to come and get our order and drinks.  When food came out it basically In-and-Out burger.. Food was gross..   Tried to talk to the manager but could get anyone's attention because they are so understaffed..  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and really had no issue until today's visit. I had a groupon for $20 and took a friend for lunch. We ordered way more food than I needed to make sure we met the $20. Upon check out, they informed me that they would not take the groupon over my app and that it had to be printed. Needless to say I was upset. Now I have to go back again to use the voucher if they will even take it the next time. I had tried to go before but did not spend the $20 so this was my second trip already.  Our food was inconsistent and did not come out at the same time. Not sure I want to go back again to even use that voucher."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of buzz about this restaurant and thought it would be fun to check it out with some friends. Though I enjoyed the diner feel of the place, I was not impressed by the food or the service. I admit my expectations were high, and if I would of been told to expect more of a fast food level of service and food with a dine-in atmosphere, I may have liked it more. It wasn't horrible but I would prefer In-n-Out any day."}
{"text":"Worst Steak 'n Shake in the world, the drive thru is always horribly slow and the employees aren't even nice about how long of a wait you have. To top it off the smell in steelyard is ungodly."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to Steak 'n Shake at the waterfront service is so slow takes at least 5-10 minutes to even have your order taken and than another ten or fifteen for the cashier to ring you out . After all of that waiting the food comes out cold . Uhm excuse me but what are you doing back there at 2 am and no other customers ? Terrible service needs new management or needs to be closed."}
{"text":"Just to start off I had heard a lot of hype from this place so I set my expectations pretty high, maybe that's where I messed up.  The manager was the one at the counter taking orders and let me tell you was he a bubbly ball of energy....NOT! He seemed so inconvenienced by the fact that we were there, took our order without even cracking a smile and to top it off answered any question we had (being new to the place we had a few) coldly. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Awful service, burger was slopped together, fries were cold and nasty, onion rings were greasy and bland.  Took over 15 minutes to get an ice water, food came before the water, they forgot my shake, and the waitress barely spoke English!  Totally OVERRATED! !"}
{"text":"The best Steak 'n Shake in Cleveland  area. We love the family friendly atmosphere. Great food and great shakes. My 4 year old daughter favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we go here & I thought it sounded good by the name so I decided to give this place a try. Pretty clean store. The staff was very friendly & it was pretty empty too so our food got out very quickly! The air conditioning in there was very cool so it made the place comfortable to eat in considering that it was very hot outside. The classic burger that I got was average but very delicious & I like the way they make their fries.... Pretty thin so you get more! The Oreo shake I got was very good as well! Definitely will be back whenever I take a stroll down Mill Ave again."}
{"text":"We saw almost no line after coming out of a movie and thought it would be a great spot to get a small dessert. Ambiance: This is 50s diner motif (think Johnny Rockets). Formica tabletops, vinyl seat covers, servers dressed in white - all very cute. And old rock and roll playing loudly in the background. Sets a malt-shoppe atmosphere. Service: The place was pretty busy, but our server came by pretty soon after we were seated. There wasn't much to our order. It came out in an appropriate amount of time. Food: Hard to comment on the food since our order was just for a shake. My wife and I shared a Nutella shake. Who knew there is such a thing as a Nutella shake? We told our server we were sharing and he brought it out in 2 separate cups - each with its own decorated whipped cream topping - nice touch. And the shake was to die for!! Next time we are at South Point for a movie, it will be hard not to stop in for dessert here."}
{"text":"We went into the restaurant and stood 5 minutes, 3 different servers walked by and the manager was at the register beside us and not one person greeted as they walked by and the manager made eye contact with me and never said one word. We left. Very disappointing, we usually go at lunch time and it's never like that. We will not be going back at night again."}
{"text":"I read many of the other reviews and thought to myself, \"can this be the same restaurant I know and love?\".  I think this Steak 'n Shake tastes just like they did growing up so many years ago.  I especially like the French Fries - mmm, thin and tasty.  The milkshakes taste just like they did when I was a teenager.  And now that I am older, I can buy draft beer - which they serve at this location (albeit expensive).  Mmmmm.  Beer.  Burgers and Beer - nothing is better."}
{"text":"Food is always cheap and good.  Usually pretty greasy but it's extremely inexpensive.  Great place for a cheap, later night snack.  Hits the spot without breaking the bank. The milkshakes are always delicious. The service was not good on our last visit."}
{"text":"The worst place i have ever had the displeasure of going to. My first few trips there resulted in ordering milkshakes with my meal and not getting said milkshakes till the check was already paid for and then reminded them i had indeed ordered milkshakes i paid for and never got. But after a friend said the last time the service was highly adequate i said \"hey why not I'll give it another shot.\". So there is like 3 adults and two kids and we roll up to the steak n' shake waiting to be seated, after a few minutes or so we had finally gotten someone and they asked the people behind us if they had be waited on. The group behind us pointed to our group and said they were here before us, so waiter said he'll try to find us a table. Now this steak and shake is not super busy but there are a few tables full but our guy is talking to another waiter or whoever and they seem a little rushed and he tells our waiter something and he comes back with, \"I'm sorry there is no available tables.\" and then he proceeds to seat a family of three that just came in. Not even the people before who pointed to us, no wait time or anything just basically tough luck we don't want to serve you. Not sure what we did maybe because they didn't want to deal with kids or something but avoid this place at all costs. If i could vote no stars it wouldn't be one tenths of the disappointment i feel for ever stepping foot in this place."}
{"text":"Play with menu. I got a royale with jerk sauce. Seasoned Cajun fries. No disappointment here. Black raspberry shake was intense. I was in a hurry. Food came quickly. Check not so much. Not a long wait tho."}
{"text":"It's a shame zero stars isn't an option. As I sit here in the parking lot. In the spot I was asked to sit in while they prepare my drive thru order. I see no less than 4 cars waiting for their orders after paying as well. I'm sure their numbers look good for corporate but this is not a place to expect any level of service."}
{"text":"This location smh wow. Disrespectful management & workers the cook Darius was very disrespectful to my wife every time I go to place they make Food very sloppy The girls at the window in the drive-through Are always rude I get the vibe that these people are very racist They act as if they do not want to serve me I stop by this place before work to grab a quick bite to eat and every time I get this food it's terrible the quality of the food is terrible I will not be returning here ever again this place is a fucking joke period. I complain to the manager once before and she act as if she did not really care and brush me off Every experience I ever had here was terrible. I won't spend anymore of my hard earned money stay alway from this place people trust me it's not worth it."}
{"text":"I just don't think you can get better than this!  It's not gourmet and it's not necessarily fast food, but it sure is good.   I often order two meals here because I can never decide.  Chili three way (that sauce they put on it is to die for) or single steak burger.   Of course, best shakes ever."}
{"text":"This place has long waits, the service sucks, and their food is extremely greasy. Don't go here unless you want to feel sick."}
{"text":"Ate here in November. The burger was tasty and juicy. The shake was good as well. I would eat here again if I was in the area. The price was right I felt for what I got."}
{"text":"I was there last week, in the evening.  Service was so slow that I decided to leave the take out line.  And I wasn't alone--two cars behind me also abandoned all hope and left.  The window personnel were, literally, taking orders, one car at a time.  When I got to the speaker, I was told to review the menu.  I said I knew what I wanted, and there was silence.  After sitting there for about 5 minutes I said, \"I am ready to order.\"  Twice. The employee told me that they have a limited time between ordering and delivering food. I laughed and said, \"But you have four cars out here and you've lost another two.  Can't you begin taking our orders and making our food now.\"  I gave up.  Sadly, the burgers, when they decide they are in the business of selling them, are very good.  So, I'll give the place three-stars-a balance between the food and their foolish, evening sales practice."}
{"text":"great food for great prices!!!!! the burgers aren't big so when you see almost every burger as a double don't freak out!!! the chili is one of the better I have had in a long time and the shakes are wonderful!!! there has ALWAYS been a line to get in each time I have been here, so be prepared to wait... but it is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to eat lunch. Food was okay. Customer services was weak. No one said hello. Where we ate was dirty lights are burnt out. Webs all over the place. People have No pride how it's ran. Good luck new comers"}
{"text":"Sooo good! A must try for sure. All the meat is steak, so burgers are ground steak, etc. They have soo many shakes!!! They are really good! The portions are perfect, not too big and not too small. Pretty much u won't feel like shit after u eat there. Order a meal and a shake to go with it."}
{"text":"I frequented here when I worked nearby. .. it was good then here's what you need to know now...  #1 CHECK your order! They will mess something up. It is almost a given now that something is wrong with your order. #2 if you have a to go with \"add ons\" like cheese fries... the cheese is not in the bag... and whatever you added on isn't there either... #3 If your server spends more than 2 minutes talkung to a table that is not yours, you are NOT going to have your order be right. .. I used to go here almost 4 times a week because of my proximity to my job but there is almost no chance of me spending money for things I don't get..."}
{"text":"Really good burger spot. Fast service, fast food spot but the qualify of the burger was a lot better than fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Slow and inept doesn't begin to describe my experience here today, it has been over 20 minutes waiting for 3 burgers and 3 fries and an onion ring. Got home, one of my double burgers is a single and I'm short a fry. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Good food awesome shakes service can be slow at times but the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee.  You really can't get better than this.  It's not gourmet, but it's not fast food either.  I usually order two meals because I can never decide what to get.  Chili three way (amazing sauce they drizzle on top) or steak burger?  This past time I decided to go out on a limb and get one of their specials, jalapeno burger.  It was a-ma-zing!   Don't for the shakes and of course cheese on the fries.  I'm talking cheese sauce here."}
{"text":"With tables open, waited 5 minutes after walking in before anyone even acknowledged us, including the manager who looked right at us. Service at the table was slow but acceptable. Then stood at an empty checkout register for another 5 minutes before anyone came to cash us out. My daughter loves Steak N Shake but with the blatant disregard for service, they'll probably lose both of us as customers."}
{"text":"Steak and Shake is comfort food for me since it's so popular in Florida. I'm just disappointed there's no breakfast menu at this location in Vegas"}
{"text":"We were sitting there for over 15 minutes and then I finally had to hunt down a waitress down to acknowledge us. After taking our order the food took at least another 20-25 minutes to arrive. My burger was not made properly but nobody bothered to come by and ask how everything was. When I took the check up to pay and the manager asked how everything was I said \"not good at all\". I don't think the manager could have cared less because all she did is say \"I'm sorry\". She didn't even bother asking what the problems were. To say the least I am not happy with this place. I would love to give 0 stars if I could. I WON'T go back ever again. Save your time and $$ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"UPDATE I am at SNS now and something is very wrong. I've had to send back my meal twice so far. The manager looks and is acting high and the other manager is too busy making and serving her family to my left.   The family manager just came by and said she was sorry and took it off my bill then served her family at the same time. Wow. Never again will I come back. Sonic is next door and way better than this.   I have to write this review. I am/was regular at SnS in Brunswick, but something happened recently with the staff that has caused me to write this review. They are unkempt, rude, ignorant to the menu and quite frankly act like a bunch of school girls in the hall.   I love the garlic double burger there but without the garlic spread. So in other words a burger with the garlic salt on top of the bun.   So that's what I ordered. My girlfriend ordered a Frisco and it was fairly slow that evening. Our waitress took the order and came back with the food some few minutes later and that's when I realized that it had the garlic sauce on it. I asked her about it and she became flustered. I was not rude, just asked her what it was as I normally get it the way I described above. She then, without saying another word took my plate and went in the back. She came back 2 minutes later with a bun and two plain patties. I started to ask her a question about it, but then just asked her for a slice of cheese and the manager.   She went over to the grill person where everyone gathered to hear her speak. Then watched as the manager who was a part of the group, a person I'd never seen before, came over and told us that she, the waitress, was new and didn't understand the menu.  The manager, who was pregnant, told us that she doesn't really care for the meat quality anyway and won't eat there. Maybe she said that, because we didn't ask anything close to anything like that, because she was pregnant and I've heard of people saying certain foods can be off putting when pregnant, but the whole experience was surreal!  We were both baffled and now clearly frustrated. We ate the fries and left. Waste of $$ and time. Steak and Shake has lost our business. When and if they ever decide to hire people that actually read there own menu or eat there own food then we may consider going back. Until then, I'll go elsewhere to spend my hard earned money!"}
{"text":"One of the WORST experiences I have had.    On 11/25/2016, When we got there, it took ten minutes to be seated. Then we're told that it would be a 10 minute wait for food because they were really busy. Well, ok, but there were only 2 other tables with people at them. The rest of the tables were covered in dishes. Not a single other table was cleaned. Then a few others came in and we're told the same thing. Then a couple came into the restaurant and waited for about 20 minutes before being sat. Then they were say at a filthy table and when they complained, were told to leave and they called the cops on the  couple. We never received our food after a 45 minute wait, so we just left.   Absolutely terrible service, don't waste your time, regardless of how hungry you are and how late it may be."}
{"text":"If I was sent a \"Dine with us for free\" coupon for 4 people, I would not return.  The place was loud, full of kids, and the \"steakburger\" really was both small and lacked flavor. To add, the chili was perhaps the worst I have ever had in my life - tasteless, no punch and watery.  I could not find the exit fast enough. What a complete distaster......"}
{"text":"Before I get started, I just want to say that I'm aware that people have rough days... that being said, my family had the worst experience here last night. We walked in the door at around 5:45 pm and were immediately looked at like we were an inconvenience. When I asked the girl who seated us for two kids' menus (for my TWO KIDS), she rolled her eyes as she put one of the adult menus down. She ended up being our server... I should have known right then that we were going to have a bad time. This location has a reputation for being ridiculously slow, and I was aware of it when we chose to have our dinner there. Normally it's pretty busy, so we don't mind a little bit of a wait. However, last night there were maybe 6 other parties in the dining room and 3 of them were already eating. We waited almost 10 minutes to even have our drink order taken (we were ready to order food by then), and then waited another 15 for the drinks to get to us...   My kids were occupied with their placemats and my boyfriend and I were engaged in a conversation, and we started to feel like we'd been waiting a pretty long time. I looked at my watch - it was almost 6:30. Our server was standing over in the corner playing on her phone while two of the other servers were bickering back and forth. Two parties who had come in after us had gotten their orders, and we couldn't even get her attention to ask her what was going on! About 10 minutes later, she walked over to the table behind ours to see if everything was ok and started to walk away without checking on us. My boyfriend flagged her down and asked her what was going on and she seemed pretty disinterested in finding out where our food was but went over and looked at the slips and then went to find a manager. She came back to inform us that there was some sort of mix-up and that our food would be out shortly. Another 10 minutes goes by...  By this point, my kids are starting to become visibly upset. We flag the server down again and ask her what's going on and she disappears to go find the manager again... a couple minutes goes by and she tells us that the manager is making our order and that it would be up shortly. We expressed to her that we were a little upset that it had been almost and hour since we'd gotten there and we still had no meals. One of the managers, a very young blonde girl with a bit of an attitude (I believe her name was Brittany) came over to our table and asked my boyfriend what we wanted her to do about it. Seriously?  7:00 hits and FINALLY our food comes out. Naturally, one of my kids' meals was made incorrectly, so we had to have it remade... it came back with mayonnaise smeared all along the one side of her bun. Our server didn't even come back to check on us until we were done eating.  There was another manager on duty, Erik, who came by to apologize for the mix-up. He comped our meal and gave us a voucher for a free meal for the whole family the next time we come in. He and the very friendly girl working the register  (I believe her name was Ida) were the only positives we encountered during our visit.    tl;dr This place is slow, most of the employees don't give a crap, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Did you know they have dropped the Chicago Dog?  Always ordered that, as husband likes the steakburgers and chili mac.  Very disappointed that the Chicago Dog is gone!  Liked the taste of the grilled dog! So, now in addition to not being able to get the Chicago Dog...can't order a regular hot dog....they don't have sweet relish, anymore!!   How hard is it to have relish on hand for hot dogs?? Nothing for me there, anymore, except the shakes!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on Saturday (2/14 )night for shake, waitress just looked at us while we were standing by the sign that said \" wait to be seated \" . Mind you , there were only couple people in the restaurant and no one else is waiting in the line .Clearly they are not busy. So, we waited 5 minute til we finally decided to sit ourselves down and got our own menus . Finally, a waitress sitting on the booth realize we seated ourselves. The place is dirty and couple of the staff looked loopy and unfriendly ."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a seat and then the servers forgot us. My father asked who our server is and the gal at the front gave him lip and tried to deny having lipped off to him when the manager asked what was going on. When we did get a waitress she was good. We will see how the food turns out."}
{"text":"The food was great and very well priced considering we are on The Strip. The seasoned French fries were my favorite! La La was our waitress and she was fantastic, professional, and personable. Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had in my life!  Fantastic.  The shakes are also amazing.  The service was so fast it blew my mind.  How do they make food THAT good so quickly?  The shoe string fries are just okay, but everything else is so good, so I don't care."}
{"text":"Still good food but this place needs a thorough scrubbing. And a manager who's a little less uptight. AKA bitchy."}
{"text":"Very, very reasonable prices. The restaurant isn't quite as big as it should be for how popular they are so you will likely have to wait a little bit during peak hours. There were 3 of us in our party; we each got a variation of their standard cheeseburger, our variances being only in the amount of patties we each desired. I myself chose the double and substituted chili cheese fries for the regular style. The chili was decent, a little thinner than I expected chili over fries to be but not a bad taste. The burger was good, not amazing but definitely worth $3 and some change. The fries were probably the best part of the meal; we all agreed.  It is a drive from a lot of areas in LV, especially if you're in North LV but again it's definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Lived in Missouri for 14 years and Steak and Shake is a staple so when we saw that South Point had steak and shake we were excited.. It didnt let us down pretty crowded but the food was great.  We dine in and also had take out .  !!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the shakes and the pancakes at breakfast are the best.  The reason for the 3 stars is the filthy bathroom.  I feel sorry for the employees.  Clean the restrooms."}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas on a Sunday, fairly hung over and this place was suggested.  Out of all the wonderful places on the strip, I was told to come here.  Reluctantly, I went, saw the line and was praying this would be the best damn burger ever. I'm sure it may not be the ultimate best but steak meat turned into gourmet burger patty without the gourmet price? I am all in!  Had the mushroom & grilled onion burger with a side of garlic Parmesan fries.  The burger was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just cures your hang over better than anything.  The fries could have been seasoned better but who cares when your burger is that good.  Got the butterfinger shake, it wasn't extremely unique but was still delicious.  Love this place and is the perfect hang over cure."}
{"text":"Giving a 4 star but based off entire table meal should of been a 3 or 3.5... Our first time at a Steak 'n Shake ever. I had a cup of chilli with cheese.... Excellent!... An order if fries with Parmesan season ..... Good but I'm just not a fan of shoe string fries.... Add steak fries to this place then were talking 5 stars.... I ordered apple chicken salad and it was great but you can't go wrong with salad..... My husbands burger was ok it was way over cooked and dry but we were never offered a temp for the burger... We ordered a banana peanut butter shake... Woo hoo good! Next time ask for some pink on burger ?? Overall I loved it and my kids would too!!"}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch/early dinner the day after Thanksgiving. It was about a 15 minute wait, then we got to hop the line because we were willing to sit at the counter. We all had burger combos with shakes. The burgers were pretty good, esp considering the combo is only $4! The shakes were really good, but I was a little annoyed that we didn't have them brought to us until we were almost done with our burgers. We went during happy hour so the shakes were half off, so overall it was a good meal for a great deal! We all agreed we'd go again if we find ourselves at South Point again."}
{"text":"Stars for the food, always.  I'd rather go to the Midwest or the South and experience the sit down or drive-thru--no contest.   Service = meh.  HAD to get take out, since they have limited seating, and about 15 people were in line at 2 p.m.      Food = delicious, the same as usual.  I'm from the Midwest so I know what it's about--good ol' fashioned burgers, crisp fries, and thick milkshakes.     Deal: Happy hour--1/2 priced shakes and beverages from 2 to 4 p.m.    Prices = cheap.    Note: This is inside of SOUTH POINT.  So don't be like me and drive around wondering WTF was wrong with the GPS. lol  (Strangest location ever.)"}
{"text":"So I like the steak and shakes in Florida, and now that I'm in California this location at Southpoint is the nearest one to me. Each time I've been here, I always get the double steak burger, fries, and a shake.  The prices are fairly cheap and you can get a triple steak burger and crispy skinny fries for $3.99! Best time to eat it is when your food is still hot, and whether you order it to go or eat there, don't forget your big thick shake! If you can't decide on one flavor for your shake, they can do two flavors poured side by side!"}
{"text":"We were coming home from Cleveland and jonesing for some shakes so we stopped in. We were immediately seated but waited for 15 minutes for our waitress to take our order. After my daughter ordered her shake and a drink the waitress condescendingly asked her what she wanted to eat. My husband said we weren't ordering food, to that the waitress rolled her eyes and said oh. Got our waters delivered but finished them before the shakes got to the table. The shakes were finally delivered with the check, I guess the waitress decided we weren't worth the tip, so we didn't give her one. The shakes tasted off too."}
{"text":"Our first visit here. After being seated we waited about 5 minutes for someone to come take our order. She was rude and seemed like she didn't want to be here. I ordered the single cheeseburger when it came I noticed the cheese was not melted and the burger was cold. I sent it back. I got another and yet again cold with unmelted cheese. I asked for a manager he came out and told me the burgers are cooked to 135 degrees but he'd gladly make another. (I've never seen a burger at 135 degrees with unmelted cheese.) He made it himself and this time it was hotter than the last two. By this time word got around I sent my burgers back and every server standing at the counter stared at us. It was quite uncomfortable. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've heard grant things about Steak 'n Shake and I've attempted to go here multiple times but it's always too busy.  I got the Western BBQ burger and the seasoned fries. Both were really good and reasonably priced. If I remember correctly everything was priced between 5 to 7 dollars for the burgers. Which included the fries. Next time I visit I am going to try one of the shakes. This place is definitely better than any fast food restaurant around town.  If you're in the area and you have some extra time I highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"We are in Vegas for 4 days and have eaten here everyday. You can get a burger and fries for $4! Very affordable, good burgers and fries, and good milkshakes. The turtle Carmel nut shake is the best. I'd stay away from the banana shakes though, the banana flavor kind of just tastes like ice."}
{"text":"Not bad. We came on a Sat. And it was packed a line out the door. So we opted for the take out. The burgers were good but the fries sucked. We didn't try the shakes but they looked good. Meat was good but could have been thicker. Not bad overall but I'm only coming back for the shakes. It's happy hour M-F 2-4pm for all drinks and shakes."}
{"text":"I hope I can leave ZERO stars for this Steak N Shake! The absolute WORST drive through experience that I have ever had! The person working was clearly upset that we were not as quick with our order as she would liked. She asked us three times if that \"was all for you today\". Mind you it was between every meal that we were ordering. And apparently it is not in their training to use common manners like please and thank you! We waited an extended amount of time in the drive through waiting to get to the window. Then when we got to the window the girl working stuck her hand out and stated \"18.11\"...not a hello or hi or even a smile!!! Just a hand out. She was clearly irritated to be at work, and she was very rude! She got our order wrong (SHOCKER!!!) and we had to ask for three different things that we had ordered. It was ridiculous!!! I will actually be writing Corporate on this one!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th time my husband and I have been to this establishment. The first 2 times was a very good experience however; these last 2 times we have been delivered luke-warm food. Although the hostess and the waitress who took care of us were awesome, watching the only bus girl clearing the mass amount of tables by herself while watching the other wait staff standing up behind the cash-register staff goofing off was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Good place to eat.  if you like to eat food (not specifically burgers and shakes) come here.  This is EJah Food Reviews signing off.  Final statement 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Have loved Steak n Shake for years, and was so happy when Vegas finally got one a few years after we moved here.  Our previous visits to this Southpoint Casino location have been up to par, but today's lunch was really bad.  Hubby and I both started with chili, which was watery (never had watery chili at any S n S location before, ever) and room temperature.  My husband ordered Chicken sandwich, and after waiting a long time for it, the waiter showed up and informed us the fryer was broken and the chicken patty had been taken to the buffet to be fried.  WTF?  When the chicken patty finally arrived, my husband could only eat a few bites, he said it was rubbery and gross.  My burger finally arrived and was stone cold, I believe it had been sitting around while the chicken sandwich traveled to and from the buffet.  Also, the fries were soggy.  We eat frequently at this location (the only one within hundreds of miles) and are really bummed out about today's meal!  Please tell me you are not going to allow this restaurant to turn into crap!"}
{"text":"Not the full Steak n Shake menu.  Lousy strip mall location.  Drive thru speaker next to impossible to hear due to being located practically in the middle of St Rose Parkway.  Whomever owns this location is trying to pass it off as an upscale, funky restaurant...we want regular old black & white Steak n Shake that has been around for decades.  No chili Mac or chili 5 ways.  French fries containers only half full.  Slow slow slow service even though there are hardly any customers.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Timing is everything. Wandered up at 2:30pm on Saturday and no lines. Used my free birthday coupon to order a Double Steakburger with cheese (1000 island, lettuce, tomato, onion ) to go.. Haven't had one of these in several years and I was quite pleased. Those thin, crispy fries were as advertised and the burger was freshly prepared and hot off the grill. It was also hand-formed and every bite had great cheese coverage. Yes, it's fast food, but even in this category, some places shine and Steak N' Shake (although not worth waiting hours for) is easily fits in my personal top 5 of fast food burger joints (White castle, In n'out, Culvers, Big mac)."}
{"text":"OH HOW I HAVE MISSED MY SnS from the midwest! Got my double steakburger w/cheese, chili mac, and fries on the way to Vegas. YUMMY. The line can be quite long, but luckily there is a to go window and tehy were fairly quick even with a large crowd. Definitely recommend it if you're heading to/from Vegas and you want some nostalgia, or if you've never had it, it's def worth a try. I love the steakburgers and chili mac! If you're feeling really bold, go for a chili mac 5 way. Iron stomach."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Total \"fast food\" because they seriously rush the service to get people in and out. The cherry on top of the shake (no pun intended) is that I found a sticker, yes a sticker, at the bottom of my shake. Must have come from some piece of food but still how about take some time to carefully cook so your customers don't find any surprises. If you don't care what you're scarfing down then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night with my family. There were four ladies working behind the counter and it still took about 15 minutes to get our food. Which after 15 minutes should have been amazing and instead was crap fast food. Our food was not even hot and the french fries had clearly been sitting around quite awhile. All of which I could have gotten over, maybe, except the restaurant was absolutely filthy. Food on the floor, food on the seats, dirty tables, ugh, it was disgusting. Honestly, never been in a Steak 'n Shake before, will never go in one again. Awful."}
{"text":"Started with a Genuine Chili, it was ok, not the best chili I had, but not the worst either. but did had there Strawberry Banana Milkshake- that was super delicious! I would have that again that is for sure! For the main meal, went with their bacon lovers steakburger which was pretty good, the meat was very fresh, and the bun tasty. The fries are the smaller fries type and was also pretty good,  Wife went with the Frisco Melt. and a Dr.Pepper"}
{"text":"As far as customer service is concerned, this is the WORST fast food place I can think of. They consistently leave you waiting, and when you try to ask what is going on with your order, your greeted with complete attitude and rudeness. I would love to comment on the food but I've only had it once in 3 trips there because every other time ive left because they take too long. And I'm so sure a person in management will ACTUALLY read this and care at all to fix it. DOUBTFUL. I will never stop here again."}
{"text":"Sat at the drive-through speaker for about five minutes, saying \"hello!\" and no one answered. Just as we pull away someone says something to us. Unbelievable. Will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to check out Steak 'n Shake before a session of midnight bowling with the homies.  This review deserves a follow up as i am feeling a bit under the weather and the congestion blocked out some of the flavors. Despite all that it was still pretty good. If i had to describe Steak n' Shake it would be a burger joint half way between Sonics and Smash Burger.  I really wanted to try the 3 way chili or grab a Chicago Dog meal but this place is best known for their burgers. So burgers we shall order!  Spicy Chipotle (no onion) First impression when this burger came out was a sudden burst of realization: 'That's why they offer multiple meat patties...these are tiny.' Not sure if it was the burger or my cold but there wasnt much heat in this burger. The pepperjack cheese couldnt stand on it's own against the two meat patties and if they werent there i probably wouldnt have noticed them missing, the sauce was spread too thin so i couldnt taste it in every bite. The diced Jalapenos were the most disappointing, they removed all the seeds and diced up the flesh so there was no heat and everyone knows it's the seeds that pack a punch not the fruit itself. Without seeds the bits of Jalapenos tasted like diced up green bell pepper. The real magic comes from those small beef patties. Anthony M was right they're small but they do pack a lot of flavor.  Strawberry Milkshake A cool note is they're willing to split a large milkshake into two smaller ones with no additional cost. The shake it self was really good.  Overall i would like to come back and give the chili or the Chicago Dog a try. The steakburgers are pretty tasty here but i would stick to the basic burger instead of something fancy as the patties have enough flavor to stand on their own."}
{"text":"My Fiance who isn't much of a foodie actually wanted to try this place. I guess she saw a grand opening sign a little while back that caught her eye. Well, thats wonderful because I'm glad I ain't always the one trying to dine somewhere new!   This place is located in my favorite Vegas Casino, South Point! I just really like the ambiance in this place and I won my first and only (so far!) Royal Flush here!! Enough of the small talk,  we got here starving and had to go in the \"To Go\" line since it was about 5 times shorter than the \"For Here\" line!!! Yes, the line was sooo looooooonnnnnggg, that at first I thought they were giving away free burgers or something??!!  After about 10 minutes in line and then another 15 minutes to pick-up, this is what we literally inhaled:  My order:  Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger and Fries: I love butter, probably as much as Paula Dean does.. Maybe?! Wisconsin butter, never had that before.. I'll take one of those! Wow! I've never tasted anything like it before. First off their meat was unique to my taste buds but without a doubt one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had - in a small package! The butter, sloth of onions and their meat just.. just made me happy!  Western BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger and Fries: I always love this type of burger. Now, their take on this one was humbly satisfying. I mean its their meat that sets them apart, its thin and cooked well yet not dry at all. Edges are purposely crisped on some sides and it just adds another positive attribute to the burger.. the slightly crunchy onion rings, a bit sweet/tangy bbq sauce and cheese all together made me an instant fan off one bite!   Fries (Skinny and Crunchy): I did have 2 orders of fries and I did demolish both of them with ease, along with the burgers! The fries may had been skinny and crunchy but they were perfectly cooked where there was still some evident soft potato meat in each fry.   My Fiance's order:  Spicy Chipotle Steakburger and Fries: I saw here unwrap it and literally within a minute and half at most, the thing vanished!! I knew she was hungry but dayum! She ate that thing like I was gonna snag it from her! She did say \"That was the Best Burger I've ever had. My Grandma used to make me something that tasted just like this Meat when I was young. It brought me back to that time. I want another one!\"  CONS: - Ridiculously Long Line and Wait - Burgers were sized for light eaters  PROS: - The Burgers tasted Unexpectedly Outstanding - Prices were Inexpensive  - Atmosphere made me wanna ' Eat Steak 'N Shake, RATTLE and ROLL!!'"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 milkshakes at the drive-thru that took about 15-20 minutes to get. Upon receiving they were melted! I took them into the store to get fresh ones or my money back. The manager told me that's how they come now because too many people complain they're too thick, then he offered to top my 'flavored milk' with fresh whipped cream. When I said no, he walked away from me saying he had other customers waiting and left me standing there. I was so embarrassed because he had other staff members looking at me and rolling their eyes. He made me feel like I dumped my shakes and was being a fool when I wasn't! I just like anyone else want what they pay for! When he returned about 5-10 minutes later he told me that's how they come and offered me whipped cream again. I asked for my money back and he told me he could not refund me! He said I have to come back tomorrow because that's store policy. I did get my money back the following day, but I will never return to this place again! Horrible service, staff and shakes!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"faster food\" burger joint.  As others have noted, the flavor palette is very similar to Freddy's.  Got the Frisco Melt, loaded with flavor (LOVE the sauce, and the buttered toast is fantastic), very juicy, and a seasonal Caramel Apple Shake (super rich in flavor also - the apple flavoring was a bit artificial but overall it was a darn good shake, thick enough that you'll be spooning it out til the ice cream melts enough to suck it up through the straw.)  Service is fast and efficient.  The South Point has an excellent F&B operation, and this store (it appears to be a hotel-owned franchise) is no exception."}
{"text":"I have always heard of amazing things about Steak and Shake and I've have actually been here once before long time ago but this time I really was thinking about what I was eating.   You know it's all hip and popular back in Missouri and stuff and it's good but it wasn't amazing. Or I guess it wasn't what I remember it to be. The 2 things that I do love about this burger place is the flat Pattys and the price.   The Resturant itself at the South Point location is always busy. There is a line out the door and a minimum of 15-20 minute wait sometimes you might get lucky but I'm never lucky. The other option is their togo window which is awesome because you cut your wait time in half.   The dinner is super cool and modern 50's out the servers all wear hats and bow ties and instead of paper napkin you get cloth towels. They have huge booths to sit 6 or large tables for big groups and most of the time the people there are friendly.   The party melt is my favorite anywhere and it is here. I love the thin beef Pattys and skinny fries. No they are not low fat they are just super skinny like straw almost. You also have to choice of 4 season fries Cajun, Salt and vinegar, Parmesan herb or sea salt and crack pepper. All of them are awesome. You also can do cheese fries I am a stickler for chili and theirs is ok not bad just too much  beans for me. I love greasy meaty chili. Anyways and the other thing is we ordered a shake thinking it would come in one of those cool old schools shake glasses because it's part of the experience right? Nope it was in a togo cup boo!   Foods good prices are just a few misses here and there. A place you have to try if you never have just not a place I will run to."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food. The shakes are really really good. I recommend this location if you want a decent shake."}
{"text":"This review is primarily about service. I am an immigrant person of color, and I find that when I go to restaurants without my White spouse, service is hit or miss.   This location, for example. When I went there last time, I got a very surly, slow, and unpleasant waitress. I didn't complain because I was terrified she would spit in my burger. Judging by her demeanor, she was annoyed by having to serve such scum as me. (I'm being ironic. I'm not scum, but neither is anyone else. I'm very polite, generous, and kind to service staff, and I expect the same back).   Today, I went in with my kid again. I waited over 10 minutes for anyone to take my order. A White woman came in wearing pjs and accompanied by two kids. She was immediately seated, and the waitress immediately took her order. A black group came in around the same time, and were likewise assisted. By this time my kid was pretty restless, so I asked the waitress what the deal was. She seemed genuinely surprised that I hadn't been helped. Meet the invisible woman. I was pretty close to leaving and going to Panera by this time ... but was too hungry.   When served (yes, AFTER the other two families that had come in 10 minutes after me had been served), my order wasn't as I'd requested (I'd asked for tomatoes and lettuce).   When I went up to pay, the manager and another person at the till chatted with each other for a bit, and then left. Hello! I'm still here, and still invisible. The waitress saw me waiting there, being ignored AGAIN, and went up to take my payment.   I noticed that another commenter shizuku n. had the same problem and I'll bet she is also a woman of color from Asia.   Seriously, Steak and Shake. Get a clue. Wake up and smell the coffee. We're equal human beings. Also, we're paying money for service.    It is doubtful I will return to this location. Goodbye, Steak and Shake on Neil. Enjoy your preferred customer demographics. I'm going to spend my cash where people give me respect."}
{"text":"Having just left Ohio to head back home to New York, I honestly wish I could go back and this is one of the reasons why. I went here because having grown up in NYC, I never saw one of these before in my life, but had heard of them. I went in not expecting much, and I was surprised! The four meals choice for under $4 is definitely more for your money. The burgers tasted.... delicious!! The shakes are amazing, and they have so many flavors. Everything is huge. I couldn't believe  my eyes. The fries were ok, nothing too special, but the burger, shake, and price more then made up for that.  Coming here and comparing it to Shake Shack back in NYC, I feel as through I've been robbed. I'm not sure I can ever walk into Shake Shack again without thinking of Steak N' Shake, and missing it a little. In NY, you have to wait on a  line, pay way more then, get half of what you'd get at Steak N' Shake and you're lucky if you get a seat. Don't get me wrong, I love Shake Shack, but to get what I got at Steak N' Shake there would cost me $16.25, it would still be half the size, and wouldn't taste nearly as good as Steak N' Shake. Meanwhile at Steak N' Shake for better quality, a huge delicious meaty double cheese burger with fries and a huge (OMG ITS SO GOOD) mint shake is less then half the price.   Please, please, please build one of these in NYC. Until then I will look forward to my next 8 hour bus ride to Cleveland.   Steak N' Shake.....you're awesome. I love you!"}
{"text":"This location is good but it consistantly falls short of a 5 Star experience. The food is amazing but the speed of service consistantly slow. It may be better when it is slower but more often than not it is packed."}
{"text":"Delicious shakes,  good food, fast service, nice meals besides burgers. Orders to take out, or dine in. Busy location.  Nice friendly service, good prices."}
{"text":"My family and I always come to this place when we are in Las Vegas...located inside of the South Point hotel. This time things were different. The $4 menu is gone, service is slow and the quality of the food is not what it was. Our shakes came to our table when we were almost ready to leave. I don't think I will be back here unfortunately. What a shame."}
{"text":"I have missed Steak 'n' Shake ever since moving to Las Vegas from the southeast. At long last the company wised up and entered the west. The food is every bit as good as I remember it, although the menu seemed to have been scaled down from those in their stand-alone restaurants. They also had no canned chili for sale, a staple in their restaurants back east.  If this place has a drawback, it is that the people who created the restaurant grossly underestimated the demand, and the place is about half the size it needs to be. Waits of an hour or more for a table are not uncommon, and they are losing business as people leave rather than spend that much time in line. Hopefully this will be only the first of several SnS that open in this area."}
{"text":"Three stars is probably a bit generous for this experience, but the staff is friendly.  Pros - Just a few steps from your car to the door, don't have to hike across a casino floor to get there. Same quality food. Have a drive through if you don't want to dine in - something that the other Vegas locations lack..  Cons - Have to order at the counter and pick up your own food if dining in. Very sparse selection, no menus on the tables. No ketchup or mustard dispensers, just packets of same (you have to guess how many you need). Shake variety - essentially none. The same chocolate, strawberry and vanilla that you get at McDonald's or Burger King. Not easy to find, either - got wrong directions from GPS twice."}
{"text":"Great place. The burgers are really they are similar to that of Johnny rockets actually the whole place is similar to jpnny rockets.  You definitely need to get a shake it was very good. They also mix flavors, they put a on flavor on each side. The line get long fast so I suggest getting there for an early dinner or lunch"}
{"text":"The worst customer service, ever, two visits in a row (we decided to give them a second chance and they blew it!) Never going back."}
{"text":"The food wasn't awful, but the service left a LOT to be desired. The hostess seemed to be the only one in the place with a good attitude. The waiter couldn't differentiate between Coke Zero and Diet Coke and then walked by multiple times without refilling our cups before we finally stopped him and specifically asked for it.   I guess the Steak & Shake company has very specific guidelines when it comes to good allergies, which is GREAT, but the wait staff seems apathetic and unknowledgeable about them. I told them I just wanted a plain hamburger with no bun because of gluten allergies and no mention was made of the fries containing gluten, but they did say they would make sure they prepared my burger separately. About 15 minutes after the rest of my party's food had arrived, the waiter told me that my burger was sitting in the kitchen and done (though he was not delivering it to the table yet) but that I wouldn't be receiving fries because they were not gluten free. He asked if I wanted a side salad, and I said no (because who comes to Steak & Shake for salad?!) and I asked if I could just be charged for the hamburger patty I was receiving instead of the full meal. He refused and said I would be charged full price regardless.  My friend, with nut allergies, said she had a similar experience when she tried to get a milkshake from this location, with the waitress telling her that it would be a 20 minute wait to make a milkshake because they had to make it on a separate machine. I think this will be my last experience at Steak & Shake."}
{"text":"Late (or early, depending on your definition of time in Vegas), one Thursday evening after picking up my buddies visiting from the Bay Area at LAS, we went to of all places, this burger spot tucked away within the confines of the Southpoint Casino.  It being a Thursday evening, we did not expect to see a line at 11pm snaking its away out of the restaurant.  After waiting about 20 mins, they asked if the six of us would sit at a \"4 top,\" to which we said \"okay\" because we were already quite hungry.   They offered a wide selection of the typical American fare, accompanied with, of course, an All-American milkshake should you want one with your meal.  I got the Chicago Dog with salt and vinegar fries.  Next time, if I were to come back though, I would definitely go for the garlic parmesan, which were very tasty after I swiped some of off of my buddy's plate.   Decent grubbing."}
{"text":"Wow, I rarely get good service and this waitress named Sara was awesome!!. The place was not that crowded but we got the supreme service.  I could not have asked for better service.  HOPE the other waitresses are as good as Sara."}
{"text":"This place should really be called Shake 'n Shake.  So I'm from the Midwest and I had my share of visits to Steak 'n Shake back in high school and college.  My memory must be a little clouded (from the aforementioned college days) because this wasn't the Steak 'n Shake I remembered.  When we got to Steak 'n Shake there was a 30 minute wait out front.  (REALLY?!?!)  So the husband and I decided to wait as we had 2 hours before our comedy show was to start.  We got seated and handed menus by the hostess.  About 5 minutes later our waitress came over and asked \"you ready to order?\"  No \"Hello\", No \"Can I get you something to drink?\", No \"Go to hell\", nothing.  Just \"you ready to order?\"    Luckily, my husband and I, already knowing the menu, ordered:  2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 strawberry shakes.  I was noticing that people were receiving their shakes AFTER they were done eating... so wrong!  While my husband and I were waiting for the food, a waitress came over to our table with two random shakes because she couldn't find the table that they belonged to and asked if we wanted them.  DUH! So we got two free shakes!  One was a Butterfinger which was DELICIOUS and the other was a half strawberry and half banana.  I'm not really a fan of it, but it was good.    Then came out our 2 strawberry shakes- which were yummy!!!  The burger, to me, wasn't anything special at all.  The bun was dry and not good and the steakburger was ehh.  The fries were fine but needed more salt.  The best part was trying those two free shakes (probably because those people got tried of waiting for their shakes!)  If anything, I would only go to the Take Out Counter and order a shake and leave.  Its not worth anything else."}
{"text":"Should have gone to in and out. The burger patty was so small and thin couldn't taste it with all the fixings."}
{"text":"Food is great love the original double with cheese. I do have one major complaint!!! Why can't we call in and pay when we are up at the bowling alley in a 6:00 PM league?  Doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to a large group!   We had friends passing through the city on their way to California. We arrived a little before the rest of our group to give enough warning to the restaurant( there were to be 20 of us). The hostess was extremely kind and accommodating, even with our constant party size changes.   Food and service was wonderful! Exactly what we wanted! We live on the North West side of the city, but we'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"LaLa was awesome! I think the poor girl was in charge of the whole floor, & it was busy, but she was so energetic and bubbly the whole time! Definitely made our experience a great one"}
{"text":"Why!? Why do I continue to try to go here and think I'll get good service?! Asked for a burger with mustard and pickle only. The receipt shows mustard and pickle ordered. Get home and the effing burger has KETCHUP and pickle! WTF!? Can the cooks not read? Ugh."}
{"text":"Went here for like the 4th or 5th time while visiting South Point over the years. It's so hit and miss. The last visit tonight was more of a miss. Yes, I get it's a casual dining/ nearly fast food joint. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be tasty for what it is. We had to send two shakes back tonight and we aren't send it backers. The first was \"dark chocolate\" and that tasted like stale chocolate chip crumbles. The next was a milk chocolate and it tasted like milder stale chocolate chips. You know the ones you left In your freezer to make them last longer - they don't really taste anything like chocolate anymore, they taste more like the freezer and the old things in it. So while deciding to send the second back, I just happened to overhear another server holding a shake at a service window and say \"please make another with more chocolate the table says it doesn't taste chocolate enough\" so I decided to ask for the manager- perhaps there was a quality control issue going on that he or she would want to know about. Well he was nice enough, but did not want to hear too much about the bad shake flavor. Just said he'd take it off the bill when I mentioned the bad taste. So I mentioned over hearing about the other chocolate shake from the other table and that's when he lied and said the other table said \"it wasn't thick enough\". I know what I heard the other server say and the manager wasn't there so I don't know why he wanted to change the story. In the end, he said the shakes come from \"shake base\" not ice cream and that it all comes from corporate and they have no control over it. So I guess this issue is more corporate related than location related. Listen up corporate board folks- your chocolate shakes taste really bad and your managers are defensive about it. But the chili is good."}
{"text":"Ever since my first trip to Tampa a few years ago, I've been going crazy to try Steak n Shake. It's one of those spots that seems to everywhere, but in California. It's that \"want it because you can't get it\" kind of desire so, when we saw a sign at South Point during this week's trip to Vegas saying one had opened, we immediately added it to the top of our itinerary. (fact: this is the first Steak n Shake on the west coast!)  It's only been open a week, but the hostess, Tammie, said the line had wrapped from the entrance of the restaurant to the Christmas tree by the Poker Room. Fortunately for us, the line had calmed down to 1/4 of that size, so we only waited about 15 minutes for seats (not bad considering the interior space is rather limited- it's a bit small in there!) Tammie was great though, she really made sure the line moved and was constantly updating her queue. We were on the list without half our party even being aware of it (she asked one our friends almost immediately upon falling in line, but did it so quickly that no one noticed!)   The food isn't amazing, but it's plentiful and affordable. Most sandwiches list at under $6 and all come with fries.   Some key deals to keep in mind:  - Go to Happy Hour from 2-4 (am or pm) for half off shakes (by the way, a regular sized shake is enough for two to share but, if you can't finish it or don't have a partner in shake, they'll give you a to-go cup... same goes for the soda!) - Check the 4 for $4 menu for burgers and fries all for $4  There are still a few kinks to work out, like the delay to get refills on water or to get the bill, but that's all to be expected considering how young the place is.   We all sampled:  - the Bacon and Blue burger It came with a huge clump of blue cheese, which made me extremely happy.   - the Western BBQ burger Good BBQ sauce and excellent crunch from the fried onions.   - the Portobello Burger Really tasty, with excellently cooked mushrooms, but a bit salty.   - the Banana-Chocolate side-by-side shake Delicious combination of flavors, with a banana side that tasted great and not too artificial (as is the case with lots of banana syrups).   - the Butter Pecan shake Just like someone melted butter pecan ice cream and served it straight up, but upped with the addition of candied pecans  - the Oreo Cookie shake Really great, as per usual- you can't mess this up. But what's great is they leave some cookies more whole so that milk soaked pieces end up at the bottom of the cup.   - the Orange Cream shake  Like a creamsicle- what's more to say?  - the Chili Cheese fries Good, not great. I really detest cheese fries that use sauce instead of the real deal, but it was edible."}
{"text":"This visit sadly was not as good as my post in 2011. The hostess was nice and friendly, but the food was a big disappointment and confirms why the restaurant was dead for a Monday lunch hour. My husband and I both ordered a salad that came out with several brown pieces mixed with some oversize cuts of iceberg lettuce. The Blue cheese did not taste like blue cheese and was very runny. I could only pick at my crispy croutons & carrots the most decent part of the \"salad\". I was looking forward to the burger after the salad, but bleh... The pickles on the burger were soft, not how pickles on a burger should be (crispy & crunchy) They gave me a thin piece of lettuce on it, just bland and basic. At least 3 servers walked by our table but no one picked up our salad bowl leftovers sadly. The servers seemed to enjoy standing around talking to each other. Ours did not check back on us until the end in which we were pretty done with our visit and ready to go. Even the onion rings were soft not crispy. Geez. I would choose \"In and Out \" any day over this place."}
{"text":"Can I give it zero stars? Horrible food, horrible milkshakes, horrible customer service, horrible wait time. Don't waste your time. Go to the Chickfila, and if that is closed, just go home because this place really shouldn't exist it's that bad.  I came at 9:30 pm and waited for my food for 15 minutes. The workers were impatient and rude and the lady at the window didn't say a single thing when she handed me my food. I couldn't even ask for napkins because she had already closed the window. This place is a disaster."}
{"text":"I've never experienced the slow/bad service others have mentioned here. I've eaten at this location several times in the past few years, and I always got quick service with a smile. It is Steak 'n Shake, so it's not 5 star cuisine, but if you want reasonably decent food, this is as good as any. On my last visit a few weeks ago, we were greeted and seated immediately by a very friendly server. She was happy to bring breakfast and lunch menus, and when we left, she even offered to bring us a drink refill in a to-go cup. That's service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I had to wait for my food, which I don't mind. But on top of that When I got it , it wasn't well cooked. Also my fries were greasy, and I barely got any.  I asked the girl who brought my food if she could wait until I checked my order, she said no. If there was something wrong with it I could go inside, I thought that was the point of drive through so I wouldn't have to go inside. Never again. So dumb."}
{"text":"Would get 5 stars but the teenage wait staff socializing with their friends seem to be more important than the actual customers... Oh and them banging stuff around (we were at the table next to the soda dispenser.... Food was really on point...our waitress Rachel trying to pick up the slack for the socializing teen wait staff attending to their friends..also some guy doing dining utensils was complaining that someone made more then he did.. Kid is LUCKY to have a job.. No matter how much it pays..."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs.  You will get diarrhea just like I did, no joke! Burgers are served cold, so you might as well take it home and shove it in your microwave! You are much better off to go to In N Out or Five Guys. This will not last."}
{"text":"We've been there 4 times now in the last month. The last 2 times have killed it for us, we will never be back. We went through the drive through, and the girl at the window charged us twice for our order, then had to get a manager to void one. It's been 2 weeks and the charge still hasnt been reversed on our card. They also, got our order wrong. The last time, they completely forgot half of our food. Luckily, we checked the bag and went in, and the manager (same guy from the previous time) didn't even acknowledge us standing there, just walked over and handed us the missing bag of food and walked away. Horrible location, especially for overly greasy burgers. Go across the street to Cookout instead!"}
{"text":"What happen to these places everyone I've been in lately is dirty. Clean it up Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"I had to wait for my milkshake for legit 25 minutes, after they already messed up my first order. Lots of attitude from the owner. 0/10 would not recommend. (The Parmesan fries are pretty dank tho.)"}
{"text":"Food about the same as other locations.  Sandwiches are good.  I like the fries and shakes.  Parking is congested.  They have coupons all the time in the mail and entertainment books."}
{"text":"Food about the same as other locations.  This location could use improvement.  Skip the take out out service.  Several times now they have forgotten items in my order and takes a very long time to be served.  Table service is better.  Sandwiches are good.  I like the fries and shakes.  They have coupons all the time in the mail and entertainment books."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. My wife went to place s to go order and waited for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged her or took her order. The order was completed for 5 minutes before anyone handed it to her. We were shorted French fries and a dressing for the side salad. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to the new location to give it a try because it's closer then the south point location, and definitely not coming back anytime soon. The manager was rude to mostly everyone that asked for assistance or sauces. Went in for 3 milkshakes because they're just so good and it took 40 mins just for 3 milkshakes!! Even people who ordered after me got there food and milkshakes before me. Honestly shouldn't have opened up a new location if they weren't ready, needs a lot of work to meet the standards of the south point location. Don't waste your time coming just go to the south point location."}
{"text":"I went here with my little brother because he loves this place. We walked in around 3:40pm so it wasn't busy at all, there was barely anyone there. It took them 10 minutes to get us seated and we weren't even greeted by the hostess or server. A family of five was seated before us and we walked in before them. When we finally got seated the lady threw the menus on the table and didn't tell us who our server was... a couple of moments later someone finally came up to the table took our drink order. We order 2 milkshakes. A couple of minutes later (no milkshakes in her hand) she came back and took our order for our food(both order burgers).   The food came out before the shakes and that took at least 20 minutes. I know it takes a while to cook food but that was a little insane when it wasn't even busy(there were only 3 other tables that were seated out of the restaurant and everyone already had their food). My burger wasn't even hot and I asked our server about our shakes And she didn't say anything. Our shakes finally arrived 25 minutes after we ordered them. Needless to say I won't be back. Don't waste our money at this one. Takes a long time to get what you ordered."}
{"text":"No table service. Slow as molasses counter service. Limited menu. Either go to South Point or just go to Freddy's.  I was so excited for this location to open and sadly I won't return. Not at all worth fighting the traffic and crappy parking."}
{"text":"I think this was my best tasting burger from here, ever! I went through the drive-thru and my order was promptly taken, the employee was very upbeat and polite. The wait wasn't very long at all (about 4mins.), a lot faster than what I'm used to eating from this chain. My order #14 (double steak burger & fries) $3.99 was piping hot, usually the patties are a little bland but they were seasoned and my sandwich was made correctly (with no onions). I was given ketchup, salt and pepper, and napkins without even having to ask! I was pleasantly pleased with my experience today."}
{"text":"We ordered the original burger and fries, and the burger was okay. I would say In-n-out or Red Robin is better. However, the place was very clean, they served it incredibly fast (our wait time at most was 10 minutes), and service was very friendly!  I would say the fries were even better than the burger. However, since a lot of reviews say that the milkshakes are great, I'll have to come back to try those and I'll even order a different burger to give it a second chance, maybe that Guacamole Burger, because you can't go wrong with guacamole and chipotle mayo.  Also, I love that they are opened until 3am. So it expands your options of what you can eat after a night out."}
{"text":"-Nasty the only thing that was good was the banana shake  -heck you are better off going to smash-burger or checkers for burgers and fries -nothing special about the burgers -The person taking my order had problems hearing, listening, and counting money (I had to tell her the correct amount, because she was trying to figure out how to use the old fashion calculator-I'm sure her register was short later that night)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a half price milk shake!   Chocolate chip cookie dough or the chocolate peanut butter!!!!   Now the steak burgers also have the best flavor or anything I've eaten fast food and they have cute tiny short skinny fries!   I love the spicy burgers on their menu and their special ones too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Steak 'n Shake. Just not this branch, unfortunately. I was initially surprised that it was a SNS-lite (fast food-esque) when I walked through the door and further (unpleasantly) surprised by the low quality and saltiness of the parties themselves. The whole point of going to one of these establishments relies on the extensive menu, the atmosphere of a sit down restaurant with overstuffed bench seating, and the friendliness of the staff. This branch only had the latter, which was not enough for me to want to return. *sad face*"}
{"text":"This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to.   The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.  If not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.  I think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...    PS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."}
{"text":"We decided to try a quick breakfast at Steak and Shake this morning. We walked in, the place was not full,, workers hanging in the kitchen area. They looked at us a few times and never acknowledged us. After several minutes of not being acknowledged or seated we left and went to Denny's."}
{"text":"I really like Steak and Shake's food but the service here can be absolutely horrible, if you get any service at all.. the last time we tried to go here we were sat down and went about 10 minutes with nobody coming up to our table, we had no silverware, and as we waited another man walked up to the counter and started asking why he had no menus, silverware, or anything else so we just decided to leave. It wasn't particularly busy either.  And when I actually do get food, the order is wrong about half the time. There's one waitress who works there on weekday afternoons who seems to actually care about what she's doing and coincidentally that's when things have gone the best there.   If you're there when it's busy, good luck to you. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I love the food and shakes here. We stop and eat here everytime we come to Las Vegas.  Where else can you get a yummy cheeseburger and shoestring fries for $4.00??"}
{"text":"I don't know what these other reviewers are used to eating but this is below McDonald's quality and I don't like McDonald's, these are probably the worst fries I've ever had... I'm glad I came late and did not have to wait too long for this junk food!  I have two stars are because service wasn't as bad as the food. :-("}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here! It was about 3-4am and I'm from California so you know I'm use to everything being open like 24/7! My guy friend and I are on a mission to find food, he see's how stress I am about getting some food in me cause I was so hungry and still on Cali. time! He brough me here- STEAK N SHAKE, man- I like the old-school diner feel to it, real cute. We walked in through the door and here was a loud waiter! I was like whoa? its so early in the morning and here he is acting crazy (I guess thats how you stay awake LOL) he seated us at the table and began asking us what we wanted, I said I didn't know since I've never been! He gave me a run-down of all his faves,so I said well- since you like it I might as well try it- so I ordered a chicken burger. Meal was also prepared by our waiter, it came out in a timely fashion (THANKS) He began talking to us and making us feel real comfortable, I swear he was HILARIOUS- such a comedian! He reminded me of Dave Chappelle (i'm serious).  Overall, the meal was incredibly awesome and next time I'm in Charlotte I will most definitely be coming back to this STEAK N SHAKE!."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first time ever at a Steak'n Shake, at this location in Tempe, but my boyfriend is from Ohio and said this is very different than Midwestern locations of the franchise, so I am writing on his behalf to warn any Midwestern transplants in Phoenix about this location: you order at the counter (it is not sit-down) and you wait or they bring it to you- much like Panera. Service was slow and they did mess up my boyfriend's order (forgot some sauce or other) but were quick to remedy that. They had not refilled the ketchup and overall it was an okay dining experience, but not like the Steak'n Shakes you may be used to. Either way, this location will probably be a cash cow for its proximity to the university."}
{"text":"There is only one thing better than a burger. A cheap burger that actually tastes good. The shakes are great too. This place won't break the bank and it's worth having to actually enter a casino to eat here. All the shakes are great and so are the burgers. This place can't be beat for value."}
{"text":"Threatened to have the cops called on me for my grandpa making a joke. HORRIBLE food and even worse service. Waited over 45 minutes to get seated when there were plenty of tables open. Will NEVER go back..."}
{"text":"Our friends raved about their hamburgers, so we gave them a try, liked them somuch went back the next day! We heard their shakes are outstanding too, maybe next time!Prices for burgers, and fries was pretty reasonable, the place was always busy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service again. I  ordered a guacamole burger and seasoned fries, and yes, she brought  me the burger but with regular fries. I told her about it and she said she forgot so she took my plate back, 3 seconds later she comes back with the same fries, she had just added dry cajun powder to it! Not going back for a while,  maybe they get better this time."}
{"text":"I can't help but picture eating a steak mid shimmy on the dance floor when I hear the name, but neither of those visualization reflect the modus operandi of steak and shake. Still, in my head it contributes to an overall positive feeling I have for this place.    I've eaten here more times than I really care to admit. I don't want to die young from cardiovascular disease, but I do eat their salad frequently, so that should offset some of the other meals, right (what do you mean it doesn't work that way?)   The things I really dig about this place (besides the ones that occur only in my head) are the consistent quality of the food and the good service. I've probably eaten half the menu (and it's laminated, so you should be impressed). I have liked almost all of it. Philly Burger, yum. Royale, yum, Frisco, yum, Chicken fingers, yum. Chili Mac.........that's more of an acquired taste. All joking aside, the salad really is my favorite thing there and the biggest reason for that is the fresh ingredients. I have paid a lot more to eat much fancier salads at other restaurants and the produce they used was inferior to what I get every time here. The lettuce, tomatoes, and carrots are always incredibly fresh. You can get it with crispy or grilled chicken and it comes with cheese too. If you aren't a fan of super thin fries, you might not love their fries, but they do offer add on's like Parmesan which is cool. Surprisingly for me, their shakes are just good, not great. I mean, it's a shake, so can you really complain? I just personally prefer a more custardy shake with more natural flavors (the apple in my caramel apple shake tasted pretty artificial...if you've had a sonic shake it's more along those lines). That's pretty subjective, though.   The other huge plus here is the price. For dining on the Boulevard (even if it is waaaay down the Boulevard) and in a casino it's super cheap.   So, what are you waiting for? Grab your steak(burger) and shimmy on down?"}
{"text":"Finally decided i would try this joint out despite the long line thats always outside. NOW i understand why people wait in line... Its pretty much worth it, ant the prices are great! I love the fact that this isnt just a burger place they have other popular options. Costumer service was pretty good too (:"}
{"text":"I tried it based on fun reputation. Amazingly average food. I asked if they season anything and was told there is salt and pepper and a burger/fries seasoned salt on your table. We don't season anything!\"  Nice staff but eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this restaurant.  The biggest disappointment is that the shakes taste artificially flavored.    The is the authentic Steak 'n Shake experience, in the Las Vegas desert.  If you love this chain, this has the same quality food and dining experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite place during a Vegas run! Very affordable prices! Just to give you a hint, kids meals are like $2.50! Their burgers are addicting. No grease on your Patty at all! Super thin crunchy fries. Best Burger diner inside south point."}
{"text":"When you sit in the drive though waiting to order and they finally come on to ask if you've ordered, then when you say that you want a children's size pumpkin spice milkshake with no cherry they say okay a pumpkin spice milkshake pull forward, paid for a full size pumpkin milkshake that ended up having a cherry on top! Will not eat here anymore unless they find a way to get their shit together!"}
{"text":"I went in today with My best friend for Dinner, Savannah was our server, didn't introduce herself at first which is how I know the kind of service we'll receive from the jump. We ordered our food, I ordered the Mushroom Swiss with no mayo, it came it out with mayo. Instead of apologizing and taking the damn plate away from me she leaves it there, acts like I'm inconveniencing her and talks to the window crew. Comes back with another one but honestly I was so disgusted at the response I didn't even wanna eat anymore, so then she comes and puts the check on the table with the burger still on it, never let the manager know that maybe there was a problem with the food probably should do a table touch down. No, so I went to check out and let the manager know about my food and she didn't even apologize either. Absolute disgusting staff. Complete uneducated trash!!!! I couldn't believe the manager response as if it was my fault that I got horrible service food made incorrectly. I can understand a mistake but at least make up for it with kindness or an apology. I came to eat, and instead I left with not eating and angry and that should never happen, the managers definitely need to be reviewed under a camera to show the lack of integrity they have because we all know when the boss shows up of course they run a smooth shift like clock work n those employees need re trained. I am a district manager and I will never allow this at any of my establishments, Savannah would have been sent home immediately along with that manager and both returned under investigation because that's absolutely disgusting. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"The menu offer value meals of steak burgers with fries for under $4. You can get the original, double, and even a triple burger with fries for $4! Shakes costs more than the meal though, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. That statement personifies this Steak 'n Shake location. I've been here multiple times, as I really do love their food and shakes, but the service has been consistently subpar.   Once experience in particular, my girlfriend and I went to dine in. There were maybe 3 other people already seated at the counter but we were never once acknowledged by any staff. The staff chatted with the customers who were already there despite our attempts to get their attention. We waited about 5 minutes and left. Other times we've been there, we've gone through the drive-thru and had to wait upwards of 15-20 minutes to get food or shakes.   It's really unfortunate that the customer service is so poor since I love their food, but I can't justify going back with the outrageous wait times and poor service."}
{"text":"Typical diner, very packed, friendly people, great environment and the food was average not much else to say...."}
{"text":"We were in South Point Hotel and Casino for the gun show and we were really hungry. Our friend who lives in Vegas suggested this place and this is now my favorite burger joint in Vegas (in&out is still on top of my list). We ordered the single patty burger and double patty burger which was under  $4 each. My hubby ordered burger Royale which is burger with egg. My hubby knows I really liked the food because I finished the burger and fried. There is something about their burger and fries that I love....I think it's coz the patty is thin which is how I like it. Will definitely be back everytime we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is the worst managed place I have visit.  Waiting over 30 minutes for our order.   We should have gone to 5 guys."}
{"text":"no wifi available and 4glte weak signal im trying to get videophone chat with my friend and the triple hamburgers is not was it look like in the menu bec hamburgers had been flatten too thin with feathered edge i checked the grill where them made aha they were using spatula and weight to swish it thats a no no it leeches out all the juices so dont ever squeeze it! and as for smore shake they didnt make it correct way i didnt see fudge ant top with whipped crem  and wheres the sprinkling? both were found at the bottom too much fudge soooo as for them not paying attention to the register area customers and me were waiting too long i had to yell to get their attention to getting paying the bill done.....yeah manager was busy prepping the foods with latex gloves on didnt hear me holler even 15 feet away.....smh they need to install security cam at front door bec there had been lots of customers leaving without paying bill its bec of manager's inattention it not the manager's job to work the food line  leave that to other workers and focus attention on the operations and customers"}
{"text":"I was excited that they opened this restaurant and was excited to eat here, as I've been at a Steak 'n Shake establishment before. However, this place just did not live up to it's name.   Food wise - this location was comparable to the other ones I've had. But, presentation wise - I was disappointed. It's not that hard to put together a burger - but yet they've managed to mess it up. Especially when I ordered the BBQ burger. Most of the bacon wasn't even on the burger - and there was BBQ sauce all over my plate. Looked as if someone had murdered the BBQ bottle on my plate.   Service is a complete joke. The first time we went - we ordered our shakes before we even ordered the food. And yet - we didn't receive them until about five minutes after we were done eating.   The second time - we saw our waitress only when she came to take our order. We didn't have a ketchup bottle on our table - and asked the person who brought the food if they could bring us one. They never did, so we took it upon ourselves to take a bottle from an empty table. Turns out - that one was empty. So we tried another - which was empty too. By the end of the meal - none of us had any water yet - so as someone was passing by, we asked her to refill our waters as she already had a pitcher. She re filled one of the glasses before running out of water. She said she'd be right back with another pitcher - but never saw her again.   This place needs to step up on their service and fire everyone there that doesn't know how to be a server.   I would've given this place one star - if it weren't for the fact that I do love their milkshakes. Just stay away from the Butter Pecan one - but it tastes nothing like butter pecan ice cream."}
{"text":"Its been years since I've been to a S&S. Didn't know they served breakfast. Burgers never look like they do on the menu. I ordered the Frisco Burger which looks so big on the menu but looked like a car ran over it and backed up and drove over it again. Fries are just eh but the sweet tea is a good value for a buck. Shakes are pretty good, but I thought just a tad thin. wait staff is attentive but could use some help at the register as we stood there for ten minutes waiting to pay."}
{"text":"Been here a few times but have never remembered to check in... Their food is tasty and very reasonably priced if you have to pay. You can ask for comps which are easily provided by pit bosses. I love the Oreo ice cream sandwiches and the 5-way pasta... Mmmm once in awhile I'll have a double stack with super thin fries with extra seasoning.  Don't forget to tip. These people work hard and deserve it."}
{"text":"This was our first time here at Steak N Shake. In town for spring training and a festival. Menu seemed fairly easy to order from. The person handling the register took care of us and was able to handle all the request we had. Our burgers tasted great and it's nice that every order comes with fries."}
{"text":"First off,  I love their greasy cheap burgers, and those string fries. Service was nice , but really slow, much much worse than usual.  The place was filthy, dirty dishes on tables, (11 during the entire 40 minutes I was there).... no one touched them. Floor was dirty, napkins, food, even a menu on the floor.... no one bothered to pick up anything. A couple of waitresses just stood around doing nothing. Found out that the manager WAS there ,  obviously a bad manager, he never checked the deplorable state of his dining room.   Had to get my own napkins, ketchup was empty, found one a few tables over... coated in ketchup. The place should be shut down. Told a couple coming in to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I always get good food dining in but we consistently get cold food and old fries in the drive through. We live two blocks from this restaurant and my husband brought back two COLD Steakburgers and two orders of old COLD fries today during the lunch hour after a long wait behind four cars. I think the restaurant should discontinue the drive through service here or look into new management."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich I've had maybe in my life.  I am drunk so probably almost anything would have been delicious.  Ordered a patty melt and it was pretty much like chugging an entire can of mortons salt"}
{"text":"I ordered online last night and it was suppose to be done at 7:!5pm. I get their small line that somehow took 30mins. When i get to counter she looks at my print out and says it will be done in a few. I ask to speak to manager and she calls out a manager named Rachel who did not show. At 8:05pm she goes to check my food after me saying something! It was on the counter the whole time. My Food was cold and they have to the nerve to say come again. I Think Not!"}
{"text":"I am simply ashamed of myself for not writing this particular review sooner.  Steak 'n Shake is so near and dear to my heart, back from my Texas days.  I LOVE this place.  While there is almost always a line to wait (it's the only one in the valley, and probably for quite some distance), I'll always say it is worth it.  The great-quality burgers and lightning speeds for insane prices (seriously, the most expensive dish on the menu is $8) is always fantastic.  My favorite by far is the Mushroom Swiss Steakburger as it has my 3 favorite burger add-ons: mushrooms, onions, and Swiss cheese.  This fellow right here won't disappoint you nor will it break the bank.  While the fry haters out there may disagree, I actually adore the shoestring fries.  The thinness of them allows them to be cooked more evenly, in a quicker fashion, and have the high potential of delivering that satisfying french fry crispiness.  Oh, and the milkshakes are amazing as well.  I rarely order them since they are so calorie and sugar dense but they are soooooo good.  Inside the South Point Casino, all the way in the back next to the newer Japanese restaurant, Zenshin.  =)"}
{"text":"Shakes are so rich in flavor. Everything is pretty cheap.   And it's a great place to eat before or after a movie (theatre right upstairs)."}
{"text":"Nice looking old style Diner type burger place Decor black and white pictures of the old facility back in the day overall nice place food was average. I think you can get burgers else that would be better. Burger patties were kind of thin. Overall I'd say this is just an average burger place. prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"I was visiting UNLV and stop by the Union to get a quick bite. I will say they need more focus on customer service. I waited in line with 4 customers as we were ignored by the employees. I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and fries. When I received my grilled cheese the cheese was not fully melted or toasted well. I was upset that I spent almost $10."}
{"text":"This location has a limited menu. Most of the items of their site are not available here."}
{"text":"A good choice for quick cheap eats at South Point.   We were in Vegas a couple months ago & stayed at South Point.  Once we got to the hotel,  we had lunch at Steak & Shake.   I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger which was very yummy.  The flavors were really rich.  The burger itself is a medium sized burger.  For the average eater, it is definately filling with fries & shake.   The cookie dough shake was yummy with lots of chunks of cookie dough.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is the decor.   It felt like we stepped back in time to the 50s.  Tip: they have a to go window on the side of the restaurant.   Recommended for yummy burgers & shakes."}
{"text":"I'll be honest , the food is great. I enjoy nothing more than a banana milkshake their fries and chicken tenders. But the service is absolutely terrible every time I come to the steak and shake I have waited for way too long and I don't want to wait anymore if there's something I could change about this place it would be to to have a friendly staff because everyone here is miserable and lazy once again the food is literally awesome but you have to have high patience."}
{"text":"**** 3 1/2 Stars******  So the first time I had Steak N Shake was about 6 years. The second time was on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Service was decent; our waiters were quick with our drink orders. Which is good when you go out with hungry cousins. I had their Mint  Oreo Milkshake. Delicious! And I got to dip the shoestring fries in the milkshake!! Sweet and Salty? Yes please.  The burgers are pretty good too and they have a variety of options. Our meal wasn't expensive either. 7 people for about $50? I'll take it!"}
{"text":".... Tried this place for the 2nd time. They were out of soda. Only had water. They messed up everyone's order. Terrible. I'd give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Long wait time..untrained staff. The food itself was below standard and tasteless! Dont think ill be going back. Better off going to McDonald's or any other fast-food place."}
{"text":"Super slow service at drive thru. Took almost half hour to serve 3 cars. Shakes were okay but not worth the wait. I could see from car window, staffs were super slow and wasting time."}
{"text":"This is the best Steak n Shake, April our waitress was awesome.  We go and ask for her every time.  She is friendly, knowledgeable, and very sweet.  She now knows our order as soon as we come in. Definitely ask for April you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service, but my burger was good. I sat at the counter for 10-15 minutes without even being acknowledged by a server. At the same time, many employees were just chatting between themselves."}
{"text":"Never did I realize when I first sat down at Steak n' Shake in Dallas, Texas in 2007 that the way I saw food would be changed forever. Since that summer afternoon I have counted the seconds that I would once again get to savor another fresh, buttery Steakburger and never would I have imagined that it would occur in our own city of Las Vegas, seeing as the closest location is somthing over 1000 miles from here. They have THE best burgers hands down, shakes that no one else can come close to, including side by side shakes that have 2 flavors. Their fries are perfect, so tiny but so delicious. The size of the meat patty isn't the biggest but it is the tastiest. It's the combination of the whole meal, burger, fries, and shake that make it just right. The combination of the perfect food along with the friendliest people in the restaurant biz make it to die for. I'm so thankful this midwest classic has chose Las Vegas as the the only west coast city to serve this amazing food in. Today is the third visit since the 16th, and you can bet I'll be back before long again. You really can't go wrong with Steak n' Shake. Next step: let's get a drive-thru location built in Vegas!   Take-Out is available and the food is very affordable. 4 meals are $4, typical check for two is about $15"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh! It's finally here in Arizona! They added one in Vegas before I moved here a few years back, it was the first one on the west coast, and now we have our own too! Most of you are familiar with SNS from the midwest, and while this is essentially the same, it's a different format. This is called Steak n Shake Signature, basically meaning it's a limited menu in a fast food style format for urban areas. Don't worry, this one still has all the staples: steakburgers, fries, shakes. It's just a little faster and more self serve, still that great Steak n Shake flavor you've come to love! This is only the fourth location in the U.S. in the Signature format, hopefully full size 24 hour locations will follow!"}
{"text":"You won't spend a lot of money here. Great value! Burgers are good and the shakes are great. Fast service."}
{"text":"The service stinks.  That's putting it politely because every time they fucked up our order they never apologized and their lack of communication is worst.  Maybe I just get the bad server but the managers are just as unprofessional.  The to go line during their happy hour for milkshakes is so disorganized I have no confidence they ever get my order right.    These Burgers suck and are just nothing special at all.  The meat may not be frozen but that steak seasoning doesn't do anything for me.  It sucks!  The fries aren't fresh cut and they suck.  The only thing that didn't suck was the milkshake and they couldn't even get that right on the first order.  THREE TIMES I've ordered a milkshake here they've fucked it up.  I'm NEVER going back to this particular SnS again."}
{"text":"I'm shameful to admit since moving to Vegas 3 weeks ago I've already eaten here 3 times. The prices are amazing and the food is great. I like their burgers and there chicken strips. I have tried a different shake every time and they never disappoint. Yum!"}
{"text":"We drove nearly 40 minutes to come to the only Steak n Shake around. Unfortunately, this is not a Steak n Shake at all. They have less than half of the menu and informed us that is because they aren't franchised. What I don't understand is why they are listed as a location on the Steak n Shake website. This is dumb. Don't advertise yourself as something you are not because it crushes the dreams of innocent, kids meal loving people!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried and even heard about this place. I got interested because of the long line of people waiting to eat here. The take out line was just as long as the dine-in line! The couple in front of us said they had been waiting for it to open and they were excited to have one ln Las Vegas so I was even more excited to try this place.  First of all, the Milkshakes are to die for! BEST milkshakes of my life! I tried the strawberry one and then i came back for the oreo mint...both equally good....i would come back here just for the shakes!  this place has extremely reasonable prices too! Granted, yes, the burgers are smaller than your usual fast food burgers, but they are still good and you can't beat the price! most of them are around 3.99 with fries and the highest is like 5.99. super good deal.   i can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This Rust Belt institution is a regular stop for my family when passing through Vegas. The burgers are fine for what you pay for them, which come with comically thin fries on the side. But the star here is definitely the selection of milkshakes. I am a fan of the cookies and cream and the banana chocolate flavors, the latter made with real banana. Another favorite is getting a side order of beans, which come in a ceramic jar and inevitably have a yummy tomatoey film on the top of them. I'm a little disappointed at the scrapping of the kids menu, but the food is so cheap here, that it won't break the bank to get a regular portion instead."}
{"text":"Greasy. But worth the shake :) Stopped on the way out of town. If you want fast, don't stop here."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast service, and yummy food. Defiantly try a shake! There is a happy hour as well for half off shakes. It looks like an olden days dinner feel but totally new. They not too long ago added the takeout side of the restaurant. Which I think helped very much now there is hardly ever a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I have to say as my morning breakfast it was great. The service was awesome and welcoming. Went here for my work lunch after 7 pm. Be prepared to be waiting. If you have a half for lunch forget about it. Toooo busy. Like you are not important until i say your important kind of busy. Saddest face.. O well next time ill order ahead."}
{"text":"I've heard about how great steak and shake was pretty much my whole life. Considering this location is on the other side f town from me, it took me a while to make it here. Boy was I disappointed though. I got th triple burger (no cheese, no bun), fries and a water. Dryest burger I've ever had. My toddler wouldn't even touch the fries. Who has ever heard of a toddler not eating French fries? Husband said his food wasn't very good either. (Wisconsin burger & fries w/Arnold Palmer). Husband ate the burger, left the fries and filled up on the drinks."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about...shake was okay did not have any food."}
{"text":"Three times in a row now at their drive thru. The burgers were not hot and the fries have no salt on them. Who would want fries with no salt?"}
{"text":"They only gave 1 table for parties of 4 or more and the policy of joining tables for larger parties isn't allowed??? What type of BS is that? Crappy hostess greeting with a shitty attitude problem. No thanks, I'd rather eat at a hot dog stand on a street corner. A-holes."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and shakes.  Good prices."}
{"text":"This appears to be the only Steak n Shake in the valley so I have no choice but to come to this location, however, service is super slow and there is always a line no matter what - whether it's to be seated or to order take out. The food is affordable since it's burgers, shakes and other diner style food. They even have a $4 menu with 4 items on it. There seems to be a discrepancy in the amount of food I get when I order take out though since it always seems like I get less food when I order it to go compared to when I sit down and dine in...thought that was a little strange, but for the price, I'm really not going to complain too much. I just wished there were more locations in town since that would likely relieve the crowds at this location"}
{"text":"I love Steak 'n Shake.  I was so very excited to see a billboard advertising this location as we drove into Vegas this weekend.  We schlepped out to South Point on Friday night to get some shakes, and were surprised by the line.  No big deal, we'll just get our shakes to go.  There's a line inside the restaurant for the take-out counter, and the hostess tells us to get in line outside the doors.  OK, fine... so we wait.  And wait.  And the line doesn't move at all.  After about 15 minutes, my friend finally gets the hostess to talk to him, and she said that it would be at least another 30 minutes until we could order.  WTF?!  Have these people never worked in a take-out situation?  It seemed like they were taking an order, cooking that order, and then charging that order... not taking another order until the prior order was cooked.  I don't get it.  Literally, we saw *one* take-out order leave while we were in that line for 15 minutes.  We just wanted shakes.  There's no reason in the world why this place is so very disorganized.  We left without our shakes and ended up at Dairy Queen with friendly service.  I miss Steak 'n Shake and will have to visit one in the midwest on my next trip there - and just try to forget that there's a lame attempt at one in the South Point casino in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty much have loved this place since the first time I visited. The food is great and the prices are decent! The service we received on the trip we made today was excellent! Our server was on the ball and very attentive, he even made sure to bring us refills on drinks without us asking :) Our food came out quickly with no hiccups and  everything was hot and delicious! I also love the fact that they have more than just the kiddie menu and crayons for the kids to stay occupied while waiting for our food, my girls were happy and content the entire time! This place is clean and the service rocks, food is awesome and it's definitely worth the trip! We'll be visiting Steak n Shake time and time again! This place can get busy so beware of a possible wait especially on weekends and peak dining hours."}
{"text":"Came here on opening night, so of course the line was long. Like waiting in a Disneyland line, but the ride was worth the wait.   I never knew a me-me-me, a melt like this(common- \"the light\"). steak patty melts- original. I was torn between the pepper-jack pattymelt and the peppercorn pattymelt, so I ordered the peppercorn with pepper-jack cheese. Yes! the sourdough bread was as it should, crispy and golden, and rich. the steak was good, but it wasn't booming as i thought it'd be. but overall, it filled me up to the last penny, and i was definitely satisfied.  i ordered the turtle shake. wow, very good. shake at its optimal behavior. the regular size is pretty good, i think it's sharable though, even after eating a generous portion of my meal. i'd say, and this includes the calorie conscious fokls, half a glass would've sufficed for me. needless to say, i did finish the shake. most like the best part of the dinner.   the service was good, which closes the deal."}
{"text":"Staying at southpoint for a conference and with lunch on your own decided to try it. Had the sliders with fries. Good flavor and you can have different flavor combos on them. Quick service. Though I believe the biggest allure to this place is the shake, which I didn't try on this visit. Affordable And satisfying portion size."}
{"text":"I live in the Midwest for a while and really enjoyed Steak N Shake.  So I was very happy when this location opened.  I always get the chili 5 way, which I love, so can't speak to the quality of their other dishes.  If you come on a weekend the wait can still be a bit ridiculous so I highly recommend coming during the week."}
{"text":"Steak and Shake and I have a weird relationship....milkshake wise, I have absolutely no complaints...flat out love them any flavor anytime....but ordering food here is very complicated.....no matter what the order, it's ALWAYS missing something...what is up with that?  I order a chicken patty melt and half the chicken is missing....or the bread is missing or the bacon is missing?  I am afraid to ask what might be going on in that kitchen so from now on it's strictly milkshakes for me."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes for affordable prices! The kids love it here. The family and I don't mind the location or the wait. I don't expect perfection or excellence since it is a fast food joint. It's our go-to burger place.  My favorite is the Jalapeno Crunch Steakburger: great mix of textures and flavors- Crunch from the crispy Fried onions, a spicy kick and a great balance of acidity and tang from the Jalapeños and freshness from the Salsa, more heat from the Chipotle mayo and pepper jack cheese.... yum!   I love this place! Way better than Shake Shack or White Castle to me, and way better prices!"}
{"text":"Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Good place, good hamburgers, lots of great toppings to choose from when ordering, Reqlly good shoestring fries. The shakes are not great, mostly artificial flavoring, no hint of a real strawberry in my strawberry shake, but priced high. Burgers priced very reasonable. Ok service. Fun atmosphere. Our kids loved the paper cars and stickers. Kids meals priced great. Good family place. Weekdays 2-5 burgers and shakes half off."}
{"text":"My fist time here. My son's choice. Everything was good . Our server was super nice and informative . The food was as expected."}
{"text":"The Wisconsin Buttery Steak burger is the best hamburger I've ever had. California may extradite me for saying this, but Steak 'n Shake is better than In-N-Out"}
{"text":"Great blueberry pancakes! Comparable to Cracker Barrel's blueberry pancakes which, until I tried Steak N Shakes, was the best around! The service this morning was excellent & the price was more than reasonable.  There is a waffle house down the street that is by far the best & cleanest waffle house I have ever been to but when I'm in a hurry, this steak n shake will be my 1 & only option from now on!"}
{"text":"Just waited in line to be seated. We got our table. For 10 minutes we waited and watched waiter after waiter walk by. No one came to ask us what we would like to drink. No one came to take our order. I over exaggerated a few loud coughs as our waitress walked and she ignored us. We walked out and will not be back as our business is obviously not wanted."}
{"text":"Stopped in this establishment for a quick bite to eat. The service was very fast, the staff was very friendly and knew the menu and were able to answer the few questions I had.  The food is good. It is a an American food type of place, hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, and milkshakes!  My boyfriend had the sliders which were very tasty. You can choose between different flavored sauces to add to the burgers. The best tasting were the garlic and the Cajun choices. Def recommend.  I had the taco salad which was surprisingly tasty. The salad was huge and the ranch dressing was absolutely delicious!!! I would definitely return and the prices are on point! Very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I like just a bout everything in this place!! you have to try it the banana vanilla shake!!! and make sure put egg on your burger, it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty like it should be for that many calories, but I sat at the counter at this location for 30 minutes before someone bothered to take my order.  Very slow service, and a number of visibly frustrated customers.  I watched as one of the employees texted right next to me for a minute or so, then put the phone away only to walk right passed and tell me he'd be with me in a moment."}
{"text":"Had to give the spot 4 stars... The place is cool the food is good & the price is Right :D plus its @ my Casino. SouthPoint :D perfect spot to chill, grub, burger, shake did I say chill? You gotta try it..."}
{"text":"It's a great place to get some food if you're staying at South Point or the timeshare next to it. It reminds me of a Johnny Rockets, transporting you back in time to where burgers and milkshakes were the thing to eat.   The menu is great! Simple and cheap and the milkshake variety is amazing! You can mix the flavors as much as you want and there are so many to choose from! The server was really very nice and super accommodating. I would definitely go back for the chili cheese fries and milkshakes because they were super delicious !!"}
{"text":"Steak and Portabello Mushroom Burger is DELISH!! Lots of flavor.. Great service. Little bit of a wait. Reasonably priced. Perfect for families!!"}
{"text":"The best Burger with aguacado touch. Hmm delicious and that shake the best . I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Listen ok so i usually enjoy this restaurant but today, hmmm today is much different. I came to steak n' shake after a long day of shopping and I was very hungry just looking for a meal. It took a while to be seated but it was alright and we sat down and ordered like normal. Then, I found out  our waitress was a talkative slacker. She gave us the wrong Order and blamed the cooks even though it was her fault. Also, we waited for 45 minutes to get our food even though there were not many people in the restaurant at all. As we waited we noticed our food was sitting on the counter. While we tried to be patient our waitress was sitting and laughing with other members of the staff and not tending to us. We watched hoping she would bring us our food but eventually another waitress realized and brought us our food. It was upsetting to see how steak 'n shake has really gone down hill. Such disappointment for a usually great place to eat."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Steak 'n Shake was when I was in Chicago and went through a Steak 'n Shake drive-thru. I got the Frisco Melt and a milkshake. The sad part of this story is that I live in Los Angeles and it is heart-breaking that there isn't any Steak 'n Shake around here. So when I stayed at South Point in Vegas, I knew I had to get Steak 'n Shake!  I tried to call to order my food for pick-up but they said that I had to physically come in and order the food. Every time I passed by the restaurant, there is a line of people waiting to dine at Steak 'n Shake. So I knew I wanted my food to-go. There was a line for take-out and probably 7 people in front of me. By the time I ordered and got my food, 45 minutes have passed. I guess there is just going to be a wait regardless if you're dining in or taking it to-go.   I ordered the Frisco Melt (I love it!), which came with fries. I also got a cup of chili and a large unsweetened tea (the tea was only $1!). The Frisco Melt was delicious and just as I remembered it! I got a side of Thousand Island (which was 25 cents) to dunk the sandwich in and that only made it all the more enjoyable! The fries were okay. I personally thought they were too skinny and did not have much flavor. The cup of chili was rather disappointing. When I opened it, it had a thin visible layer of oil at the top. It was somewhat bland and there were no toppings like diced onions, tomatoes, cilantro or sour cream.    Nonetheless, I would definitely go back for the Frisco Melt. I might just stay at South Point again, with one of the major reasons being Steak 'n Shake! I wish it was closer to me but until then, I will visit this location despite the wait!"}
{"text":"The staffs are really friendly here. They're so nice, always coming to check up on you. The line is a bit ridiculous to get in but I guess I came on a busy day. Once inside, it takes them a while to bring you the water and after you order, it takes about 20-25 mins to get your food so you can start eating. The speed of the restaurant is really really slow. Like idk what they do back there but they're really slow lol.  On the other hand, the food was very delicious. I loved it. The shake is great, the burger is greesy but it's like greesy good. Greasy? But yeah, it's really really good. They have this really spicy jelopeno vinegar sauce that is to die for! I definitely recommend this to everyone who loves burgers to come here and try it.  The only problem that I may see people having problem with is the slowness.  But hopefully you enjoy it and hopefully this helps! :)"}
{"text":"Steak and Shake has consistently decent food and the shakes are always a hit. Our server was friendly and efficient - bringing us our food the second it was ready. We have no complaints about this location!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, not very clean, and staff is unfriendly. Food is okay, milkshakes are great, but i wouldn't recommend going here on a night out if you're looking for quality food and service."}
{"text":"This is the absolute BEST Steak 'N Shake in Las Vegas, Great tasting food and shakes, great service, lots of TVs for entertainment. Definitely better than the hooters restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with the well famed Steak N' Shake.... My friend from work built this place up for months, so walking in the door my expectations were through the roof...  There was a long line being that it was opening night...  This wasnt really a problem as people were seemingly very patient and when management came to pass out free cookies, this only increased everyones patience.  I finally made it inside after an hour and 10 minutes of waititng.....  Upon first Glance of the menu, I was overwhelmed with choices... I ended up going with The Triple Steakburger with fries, chocolate shake and a coke zero.... gotta love the coke zero thrown in there... Like I was concerned with the calories that the soda would give me...    The food arrived, what a glorious moment.  This burger was pure perfection all the way.  The cheese was melted perfectly inbetween the layers of the 3 burgers and the bun was nice and light....  I finished the entire plate in a matter of moments and right after I finished it left me with feeling like I have to return ASAP.  I gave this place 5 stars because that is as high as Yelp lets us go... I would easily rate this place 6-7 stars.....  Oh yeah, did I mention the price?  36 dollars total with tip for 4 adults and 2 kids is a steal for the quality of the food we experienced.  Have at it Yelpers!!  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"The woman working the drive thru today, Sunday June 12 at 6:15 was the absolute WORST. I ordered two meals and an extra side of fries, well the extra fries weren't in there so I went inside to simply tell them that I just wanted my extra fry which I paid for. The lady proceeds to come up to me, ask for the bag because SHE KNOWS she put three fries in there. There were not three fries in there and she rolled her eyes at me. Like are you kidding me?! People make mistakes but you don't have to look at me like I'm white trash because of your mistake. Very upset about this and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! Been waiting for 20 minutes for 2 shakes and they gave them to someone else!! Now we have to wait another 20 minutes!!! This place is also a little rowdy for me and my girls!! Never coming here again!! Go to DQ across the street!!"}
{"text":"During our week trip in Vegas, we ate here twice. Once at about 9:00pm with the Wife, we shared a Frisco Melt and shake. One word - AWESOME!! That is why the next day we brought the whole family for lunch so she could have a Frisco to herself. I tried the triple burger. The kids had items from the kids menu, they were all happy with their choices and I enjoyed the triple.   Will make sure to eat here again when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good service. Loved the food and a good price too! I was surprised that the price for milk shakes has gone up and is almost as much as a meal now. Our server was the only mail server but he did a good job. He was really sweet when we accidentally spilled a drink, he got us a new one. I got the shooters and it was great."}
{"text":"Great experience. The waitress was very helpful in my menu selection and kept my coffee warm. the food, noise level and service was phenomenal. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food we had (only 2 bites of my burger due to the massive hair in it.) The fries are great, I like them thin. Although I don't usually leave reviews to fast food restaurants I have to here because of how bad it was. Our waitress was very polite and really seemed to enjoy is being there. And the milkshakes were great. Otherwise I don't recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"It's been 7 years that I have waited to again have their famous \"Side-by-Side\" milkshake, along with their well-renowned steak burgers.  Let me tell you what: it was well worth the wait. The food was wonderful and the service was friendly, despite the stress and tensions built up by the amount of people coming in to have the same great burger.  Definitely look forward to hitting up SnS again this weekend before heading back to New England area!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin on this one....My review is for the staff's customer service and not the food...  First let me skip to the end first.  The cashier could not add and do simple math which is scary since well it's kinda her job.  Our bill came out to $102.00 and some change.  My girlfriend gave her five $20.00 bills and the response twice was, \"This is only $80's, I need another twenty..\".  Even after we recounted it and told her how much this many bills adds up to she looked puzzled.  Maybe we should have explained it in Spanish!  Secondly, our food took forever!  Two different groups came in  after us and got their drinks, food, etc., before we even got drink.  Our waitress disappeared, then the waiter was no where to be found, then the manager or lead someone was mentally kind of not there....  As the food ended, just like to get the food, I had to stand up and actually go find someone as we had been sitting for a while just to get the bill.  Not to mention the lead or manager or hostess person told us that she wasn't sure why our bill was closed out...  All in all, I would say just order room service or go get something down the street!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited about 10 mins for our drinks. When I asked our waitress if they still made or could make the veggie melt, she snidely remarked \"Oh no, we can't do that.\" Granted said item was no longer on the menu, is available only in limited locations, blah, blah blah. It's bulls*** in this day and age. (Time to step it up with the menu folks.) They already have all of the ingredients on deck, so technically they still could have made it. Should not have even been an issue.   But,  no no. There was not even an offer of maybe we can put something together for you, let me ask someone. Nope. Zero f***s given. Totally off-putting in a big way. I guess I expect too much out of people sometimes.   My husband and I had no problem getting up and leaving. We went over to Ruby Tuesday's where we were given excellent service and great food. Maybe she should take some notes from them on how it's done!  In conclusion, I don't have enough middle fingers for that restaurant. Not surprised that they have such horrible reviews."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is one of my favorite past times I like the milkshakes I like the burgers and thin fries. Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"$4 for a triple burger with everything except for cheese and fries can't go wrong. Ask for their 4 meals at $4 not on menu. I really liked the burger but didn't care for the fries, too thin kinda like those  shoestring potato chips.  Surprisingly there was a lot of dining space. Service was ok, friendly and quick enough considering the were pretty busy."}
{"text":"Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high.       Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging."}
{"text":"Waited in drive-thru 10 minutes and my fries are cold and stale.  Barely any bbq sauce on burger.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Burgers are the size of Whopper Jrs! Before coming in I was concerned burgers would be dry because it was made with sirloin--I was right."}
{"text":"Who knew the \"steak\" in Steak & Shake was a hamburger? I learned that valuable lesson tonight.  I had always assumed that it was a Sizzler with Shakes.  We've been dining out at least once a day while visiting Sin City and this has been by far the best value for a great hamburger and fries.  $4.95 for an incredibly tasty double cheese burger and shoe string fries with several items available at that price. We were seated quickly, ordered and food arrived surprisingly fast. You won't find a steak at Steak and Shake but you will find quality food at a great price!"}
{"text":"O boy. Steak and shake brings back so many happy memory's. I absolutely love this place: the burger and fries, the shakes, the cost, everything. I had so much fun gambling, drinking, sports betting, and getting food here. If you have a chance come here and enjoy a great tasting burger and fries. See you in a few months steak and shake,"}
{"text":"While the food wasn't that bad, drive thru is so very awful.  I placed my order at 12:37 pm.  I finally got the food at 12:51 pm.   That is totally ridiculous.  Step up your game plan."}
{"text":"Ok so it's sort of a catch 22 as to why I have deducted the fifth star..The place is so delicious that the line to get a table (or take out) is ridiculous pretty much ALL THE TIME.  A positive spin on the long wait thing is that it allowed for my party and I to catch up on the latest and greatest going on in each others lives. Then we were sat..  Our server was prompt in taking our beverage orders and his trusty sidekick (or busser) assisted in the timely food and beverage delivery department.  I would like to preface this review on the fact that I am not a red meat eater at all. Every once in a while if the mood strikes me and a lean piece of meat crosses my path I'll take a bite, but that's about it.  On this Steak n' Shake evening the exception was made without hesitation.  My \"real\" order was the guacamole chicken burger and a chocolate shake (hey! you can't eat at steak n' SHAKE without getting a shake!), but I had to order a single steak slider just to say I tried it.  DELICIOUS! If I ever have a craving for some red meat again (rare, but it happens) I would most certainly put Steak n' Shake at the top of my list.   Nothing fancy, just a throw back to diner dining with mouth watering classic burgers and shakes!  If you're in the neighborhood give this burger joint a try; as for the wait, consider it in-person social networking.. like the good ol' days ;)"}
{"text":"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We waited easily 20 minutes to PLACE an order at the front desk. The cook clearly hates working here, and with an attitude told us it would a while before we were helped. Finally another staff person came over and took our order. The cook decided to take a break after we placed order and disappeared to back for at least 5 minutes. The workers all seem like they hate customers and working together. Food is decent though, once you shave years off your life waiting for it."}
{"text":"I dunno. This Steak n Shake location on St Rose jus seemed a bit off. There is no street visibility. The parking lot is weirdly sloped (which I ended up scraping my tire rim on the curb- I know, my fault but nevertheless). And again, I dunno- the feng shui in this location jus didn't feel right. As for the grub- meh. Lots of hype but really- jus an OK burger n jus OK fries. I did not try the shake so maybe that is what they are known for? The menu was limited (don't know why). For my money- I'll go to Freddie's or reliable In-n-Out next time!"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed this time around. Not by the food but of how filthy it was at the take out area. I don't think I've ever seen it this bad. There was receipts and trash all over the ground, menus spread on the counter and more trash. To top it off...the cashier didn't look like she wanted to be there, so there was no greet, no smile, no customer service!  However, I did order because my boyfriend and I wanted something quick to order and not have to sit down. We got 2 milk shakes. I got the strawberry milk shake and my BF got the peanut butter milk shake. We both got the Wisconsin Buttery SteakBurger which is a bounce SteakBurger w/ grilled onions and real Wisconsin butter melted on top  The milkshakes are good. There's nothing particular about it that makes it stand out or special. Just your typical milk shakes. The Wisconsin burger is probably my favorite. I love that buttery taste in the burger and this is only time I eat onions on a burger. They cook the onions until they're nice and soft which also adds a nice flavor to the burger.   I would like to rate this higher BUT this is a food establishment and I think that anyone serving food should have a clean place even when it's busy (bc we all know it gets busy there)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. You have to go to counter to order then u have to walk and pick it up yourself. The menu is small compared to the normal menu. No chilli 3 way."}
{"text":"Diner style burger joint inside the South Point hotel. They have a huge burger menu that also includes regular sandwiches. The service is super fast and it's a good alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"My family and I ate there yesterday. Everything was great until about 3/4 of the way through my Royale burger when I adjusted the bun on my burger and found a bug squashed between my tomato and lettuce. It was big enough to see its' wings, antenna, and legs. I was so sickened that I vomited until there was nothing left in my stomach. My family will not eat here again. If you are going to eat here... inspect your food first. I reported the incident to the health district, so hopefully if their kitchen is unsanitary, they will have to clean up their act."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake is okay in general, but this location is not the place to go to.   Very slow service. Our burgers were also incomplete. I got the jalapeño crunch one and it only had the meat, buns, and cheese. Everything else was missing. The manager checked up on each table there (including us) so it showed that he cared, but the staff is slacking."}
{"text":"The price is great and the food isn't bad but the service is slow and impersonal. All the employees look like they hate their jobs. The shakes are normally good but they are also inconsistent. The last time I ordered a birthday cake milkshake it wasn't blended well and tasted like milk and ice."}
{"text":"Staff is soooo slow, not even busy, takes 20 minutes to get order taken, 2nd time here this week, MISTAKE, will not be back for a long time, they need new staff. Takes too long to eat here! A couple got up and left while I was waiting as well, losing business for yourselves as well! Need management here at all times that actually care about customers and realize why they are here."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service.  Drive thru was not working, employees didn't care about anyone. Took forever to order. Then that person left and never saw her again.  Other people entered and nobody even cared. Waited 15 minutes,  3 people that ordered after me received food before I. As I was looking in kitchen to see if anyone that worked (?) there would acknowledge me, I saw my order being prepared. The cook was fondling my food. I refused the food and got money back. I wasted 20 minutes of my life there but I learned this Steak and Shake is horrible.  DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great, especially if you're on a budget!  First off, I can't think of anything wrong with the service. Given that the restaurant is usually pretty full, the waitstaff does a great job. They're friendly and quick. However, if you find yourself needing something after your food has been delivered, you may have to wait longer than you'd like (so make sure you ask for extras right when you get your food!)  The menu isn't huge. There are steak burgers (not ground beef, but chopped up steak). I find the patties juicy and delicious, albeit a little thin. There are myriad topping configurations, so there will be something for everyone (even if you're one of those weird meat, cheese, bun only people). I'm partial to the Royale (hello, fried egg!) and the Jalepeno Crunch (good spicy, as opposed to want-to-cry spicy). All the burgers come with fries and are quite economical (I want to say you can get a basic burger and fries for like $4. Specialty burgers, with fries, are about $6). There are also hot dogs, salads, chicken strips, etc. The milkshakes are fabulous! They're served in big malt glasses with a straw and a spoon, with whipped cream and a cherry on top! Completely worth it.   FYI: there is a take-out line. Also, when dining in, you pay at the counter in front. Oh, and be sure to throw some of their house seasoning on your fries!"}
{"text":"Today was a sad disappointed day... They were short staffed and the manager did not touch base with any of the customers and it took 1 hr to get our food.. And the servers never come by to apologize that food takes forever. I finally asked and the cook has been slaving because he is the only one working and no one is helping. Props to the cook today! But bad to the manager and servers."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I can here tonight to have dinner after getting off of work. We had a male waiter named Adam. He barely spoke and had no customer service skills what so ever. He just slammed our drinks on the table and walked off. Our food was good. Normally we get great service here. My fiancé said thank you to him and he stormed off and didn't say anything to him. I guess we will be going to Ashtabula or willoughby next time."}
{"text":"Just had a late snack there with my grand daughter.  It was 9:30 at night but the place was really busy.  We got seated right away in a booth and the friendly waiter took our drink order within minutes, brought them and took our food order.  Shakes are amazing!  A must have.  We ordered chili fries which were just ok and an order of salt and vinegar fries.  Those were good!   Really enjoyed the experience, service and did I mention those shakes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, unfortunately my family and I had to get up and leave before placing our order, TWICE! They can seat us pretty fast, but while they have a lot of people in the back nobody comes to take your order. Not even drinks! After waiting 30 mins with no attention we got up and left. Tried again another day and the same thing. Ask to talk to the manager, the waiter went to the back to get the manager and never returned! What a HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! So disappointed that we cannot eat there anymore."}
{"text":"What the heck?!  Almost every single time I go here it's closed! And it clearly states 24/7 Monday through Sunday! I do recommend the restaurant but not this specific store."}
{"text":"While the burgers and fries were tasty, the restaurant has issues that need to be addressed. This location needs a management change; restaurant was not kept clean, not one table was ready to eat at, and the floor needed a good mop. One soda machine was in operable. Service was extremely slow given the small number of people in line. Message to GM or Owner: look at making some personnel changes at this location if you want to stay in business."}
{"text":"As ALWAYS service is INCREDIBLY SLOW, Staff is too busy chatting and/or standing around lazily,  if u get hungry around midnight and get a craving for a burger & fries,  u are MUCH BETTER off going to a 24hr grocery, going back home and cooking it yourself... It'll be FASTER & much less stressful.  Waited 12 minutes for someone to come to drive thru speaker and ask me to hold on,  then after that, (of course trapped in line by cement & other vehicles otherwise would have left) at 12:40am.... 43 minutes after arriving, I am still sitting here,  order just received, completely wrong,  and no salt (after requesting 2x) anywhere in the restaurant to give to customers. As told by two employees. I then ask for a refund, and after another wait for 5 more minutes, the manager miraculously appears with salt packets in his hand. When I tell the manager I'm going to call corporate, his response is, \"good help is hard to find ma'am. Then he shuts the window on me. Obviously that includes the manager I will never return to that Steak and Shake"}
{"text":"Nothing really to brag about, although the price is excellent.  Lines are long, food is average."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm placing 2 stars is because the food was good.   The wait staff on the other hand were rude, and not very helpful. When we were being seated the hostess rolled her eyes at us right when we walked in and we had noticed she was doing her homework for school. While we were being seated we had asked if we could add an extra 2 seats and the waitress who was serving us also rolled her eyes, I'm not sure if they were having a bad day or what not but I also work in the restaurant business and never once have I rolled my eyes at my guests. The last few things I'm gonna post are they shut off the main lights on us while still eating because they said they were closed and our waitress forgot one of our guests meal."}
{"text":"My first experience with Steak 'n Shake....and I was very underwhelmed (I hate using \"underwhelmed\" because it reminds me of Michael Kors). After hearing and reading so many great reviews I was expecting better.  I have come to realize that I just cannot eat a well done or fully cooked burger. I need to eat my meat pink or bloody, or not at all. Also? I prefer the bun to NOT be smashed when it arrives on my plate. Thank you very much.   The french fries were okay. They probably would have been good if they were actually hot or even lukewarm. But they were almost cold.   The service wasn't the best. We had to ask twice about the status of our milkshakes. They didn't arrive until we were nearly finished with our meals even though we ordered them at the same time. I was REALLY excited about the side-by-side chocolate/banana milkshake that I ordered. Way too excited. I think it was called \"choconana\". I was really sad and disappointed with my milkshake when it finally arrived. Choconana? More like fake-o-nana. The banana flavor was that really icky pretend banana - reminded me of the way the bananas taste in Runts candy. Major sad face over that one.   Blah."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and the manager Andrew  was very inviting. They had a charging station set up for phones and were dropping lures for poketops! I had the steak signature and a vanilla milk shake, solid choice."}
{"text":"Ordered the organic burger. It was good,  but not 7 dollars good.  I also hate the fact that you HAVE to get fries.  The service was quite curt, and we got our food in 15-20. All in all, a decent alternative to In N Out."}
{"text":"This was a great experience altho the line was super mega long they got us in and out quickly!  I had a chicken sand. It was delightfully crunchy and spicy!  We set at the bar oh I almost forgot their shoe string fries are best with the special seasons that they keep right their at the table for your own personal use! I see many happy returns to this location. I took a picture of my butterfinger milkshake so enjoy the food porn lol. My phone didn't work inside the casino itself. So no meal pictures."}
{"text":"The jalapeño burger was good and so were e shoe string fries. The shake was alright, I was not a big fan of it."}
{"text":"Went here just before seeing a movie right upstairs.  I ordered the all new Royale (double burger, cheese, bacon, tomato, mayo, and an egg).  My wife ordered the guacamole burger (two patties, red onion, pepper jack cheese, guacamole).  We also ordered a double fudge shake which they split into two glasses for us.  Everything was delicious especially the shake. We told each other that next time, we're getting our own shake. Most of the burgers are doubles because the meat is smaller than we thought. But the burgers were still filling. I couldn't finish mine.  They burgers come with a side of thin, crispy fries. For a dollar more you can add chili and cheese.  The prices are great and we will be going back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!    *PLEASE READ*  I go to their Robinson location every so often & have never had an experience even remotely close to my past visit to the Waterfront location.  Waited in line in the drive-thru for 40min, & was told not to pull forward from the menu until they say so.  Basically lining up traffic behind me.  Made me think they do that out of laziness so their system doesn't show that they have a line of traffic waiting, I could be wrong.    Anyway, after waiting for 40min for my food, we finally get it, I was ok at that point thinking \"well if it's made fresh maybe it takes longer\" giving them the benefit of the doubt.  We get into the bag, un-wrap our burgers to find they messed up our order?!?!?  At this point, I was pretty upset, I kept my cool though & went inside to speak to management & get it corrected.  I ask for a manager & show them my burgers.  They were basically just meat, cheese & buns.  The cook manager tells me as rude as can be (like \"why are you bothering me with this\" kind of rude), \"you have to ask for the fixings if you want them\".  I said \"ask, all the pictures on your menu have all the fixings, if they're not included why wouldn't your staff tell me that?\".  After having her bare hands all over the mutilated burgers at this point \"should I add it back on, or do you want your money back\"?  \"At this point I just want a refund\" I said.  Without saying anything, she storms off.  I'm feeling a little better, having at least resolved the situation, but then I wait... & wait... & WAIT?!?  I wound up waiting another 10min just standing there quietly.  I admit, at this point, I was furious.  Had to ask the cashier again, \"is anyone going to help me???\".  Another manager came up, the \"cashier manager\" & asked for my receipt.  I'd given my receipt along with the 2 burgers to the 1st manager.  The cashier then starts to challenge me about giving them my receipt.  They finally gave me my refund shortly after that.    All that was over $10, but it's the principal.     They're cutting corners with their menus, expecting customers not to expect a plain burger & to've driver away & settling.  Isn't that false advertisement?    Needless to say, I'll never ever return to this location & would advise strongly to others to beware visiting here as well.  To top things off, their corporate head quarters isn't listed anywhere & is like CIA level secretive.  Anyone wanting their contact info though can reach them at (317)633-4100.  Just go to Robinson instead"}
{"text":"i just ate at steak and shake and let me just say one word grossssss! two thumbs wayyyy down get a better cook hello?! and the white chocolate milkshake tasted like crap!"}
{"text":"Black and white checker decor, for all you pecker heads.   Servers and cooks wear paper hats shaped like boats. Bring a kid, and they'll give you one too.   Lose money in the casino it's in, and then go drown your sorrows over greasy food.   The shakes are pretty good though. Burgers are okay, if not a bit too flat and puny. Arnold would disapprove. Why you gotta smash the burger so damn flat? Fries are skinny too. I recommend a side or two of their liquid cheese for your fries and burger, by far the best tasting thing on their menu.  Steak n' Shake is also sometimes referred to as Mistake n' Wait. For some odd reason, it has a strong fellowship of skinny, long-legged midwestern fans. You can tell they've never had a hardy burger before.  All in all, not a bad option if you feel like waiting around for some cheap food."}
{"text":"Everything was good enough at this outlet in the beautiful South Point - had the standard double cheeseburger with fries , the burger was good enough - certainly worth the 5.95 , fries were of the shoestring variety and came out nice and hot . No real issues to report , burger was a bit sloppy and the meat was frozen at some point ( Wendys rules )  but over all pleased . The chocolate shake was refreshing and good value in the 2.50 range . Quick service and a satisfying product , fresh beef is always  best so that is the only thing preventing a 5 here ."}
{"text":"The people there are nice, but the wait time is horrible and the place is always so dirty. The tables are always dirty, and there can be stuff on another table ten minutes before someone comes to clean. I go there for my lunch break because I work right up the road. I went one time, and my burger took about forty-five minutes to get to me. Another time it took fifty minutes. People who sat near me got their food before me. I told them to cancel the order, and I left. The server forgot to put the order in. It took ten minutes to get my drink. The manager said they could make it to go. I told them to forget about it. I went there there the next time, and they comped the mail.  I have a semi love/hate relationship with this place. First, it takes forever to get your food, but second the food is pretty darn good. Some of the servers are real nice, and the others will not give you the time of day unless you are a regular as I am. I feel bad for people who come in for the first time. Like the food, but the service needs some major work."}
{"text":"Waitress lisa was awesome. Very attentative and patient. Very quick with getting our order out and didn't sigh after we added a few more items like most waitresses do. Very awesome experience with waitress.lisa that I've had ever with a sit down restaurant.  Keep up the good work and ask for her for.awesome.service!!!!"}
{"text":"As former Missouri residents, we have been waiting for a Steak n Shake to open closer to us in Henderson.  Great prices and good food.  Here's hoping they roll out the breakfast menu ASAP!  ... EDIT: took them down to 2 stars out of 5 due to our more recent experience with the drive through last week.  Fries were undercooked (ewww), patty melt missing the cheese, cookie dough shake missing cookie dough bits (very very few) and it was melted and the chicken was just OK... not as good as the first visit.  Would not have even gotten our fries if my 8 year old daughter wouldn't have asked to be sure they put them in before my husband drove away.  Steak n Shake... get it together!!  I want to enjoy this place so badly."}
{"text":"12/30/2015 3:56pm  My wife and I was in Champaign checking out the after Christmas sales and decided to stop to eat at Steak 'n Shake on Prospect avenue. We were quickly greeted and seated, Our server Angel L. came over and gave us menus and water as she asked us if we wanted something to drink which were half off while we decided what we wanted to order. My wife couldn't make her mind up on what to order, so we asked nicely if Angel could come back in 2 -3 minutes. The server checked on her other tables and came back to us, at which time my wife was ready. My wife got the fresco melt with fries and a side salad added on while I got the triple cheese steakburger and fries with a cup of chili. My wife ordered the peppermint shake and was informed that they could get her the shake but they were out of the peppermint topping but could have chocolate chips as a topping. Score!! Food came out fast & hot. serve was outstanding and the restaurant was clean for the most part. Even with the topping not being available, we still was impressed with the restaurant overall and left a 30% tip on a $16.76 meal for two people."}
{"text":"There's a waitress here name Janetta who is phenomenal first and foremost before I go on about this place period recently the manager Keisha has let this place Fall Apart. I've been going here for five years the last three times my milkshakes were as thin as soup..and SUCKED.. then I decided to try the Xtreme Bacon Sandwich... last year I order the peppercorn bacon and they put half a strip of bacon. I didn't go back for 6 months after that because I was so pissed off that they did nothing when I told them. Now the extreme bacon sandwich came with half a piece of bacon. I told my waitress and she Shrugged then I went to the manager and she Shrugged her shoulders. Nobody offer to fix my sandwich give me a refund give me a discount they offered nothing! This really pisses me off as I work very hard for my money. And I don't appreciate them screwing up my food and then charging me full price for it.. this place has become unacceptable rude dirty and just blatantly foul.."}
{"text":"Great service. friendly staff. Perfect location for me. good food and awesome shakes. The burgers are all good. You really can't go wrong with any of them. Personnel favorites are the Grilled Portabella N Swiss, Royale, Wisconsin Buttery and Western BBQ N Bacon. All of the shakes here are very good but i tend too stick with the Peanut Butter Cup and Butterfinger shakes"}
{"text":"We've never eaten inside having always gone through the drive through. The drive through has always been fast, accurate, and the food has been great! The Reese Cup milk shakes are the best!"}
{"text":"The booths need cleaned and de-greased.  There is definitely a layer of filth.  Kids enjoy and can't beat the price."}
{"text":"One of the bonuses (and deciding factors of staying at South Point for a couple of nights) is the fact that they have a Steak 'n Shake. I've heard my friend rave about it, and I've driven by the one in Fredericksburg many times, but had never had the chance to check them out. So when I went out to the casino the next morning around 10:15 to find grub, I decided to patiently wait for their 11AM opening and try it out for myself.  The atmosphere is 50's burger stand/malt shoppe, with a basic menu offering burgers and fries, sandwiches, chili, and (of course) milkshakes. I opted for the 3D Grilled Cheese - sandwich was great, but the grilled, inside out bun was just a tad too greasy for my tastes. I opted for chili cheese fries as the side, and these were excellent. The chili here is unique - it's more of the gently seasoned Midwest style than the spicy Texas style ... but despite their offerings of Chili Mac 5-Way, this is not really Cincy chili. I think it's a better companion for fries than it would be with pasta or as a stand-alone bowl.   The prices here are great ... \"gourmet\" burger joints are charging 50-75% more for the same quality, and there was no \"casino bump\" in the prices at the South Point S'nS. I'm excited to take the wife to the one in Fredericksburg the next time we go through, and give some of the other burgers (or the melt) a try."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that I really like Steak 'n Shake. That said, our recent experience with the food here at this Steak 'n Shake located in the South Point Hotel and Casino was less than stellar. Several of us chose this as a quick dinner-type meal for our last evening of a fun-filled wedding weekend. My chocolate shake was fabulous, the rest of my meal could be forgotten. The fries were cold and my burger was so thin I could barely find it between the fat, tasty bun.  Glad the prices were reasonable or I would have really complained. As it was, we chose take-out so I hope the cold fries were because it took a bit to get back with the food. I will always be a Steak 'n Shake fan, but never again at this location."}
{"text":"Food was dry and cold and terrible and got our milkshakes wrong twice, should have asked for my money back and everything was so damn dirty. F this place I want my 13 dollars back."}
{"text":"Sign on the door says they open at 6:00 am. Was there at 6:45, doors locked and employees inside just ignore someone trying to get in"}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I get the Chili Cheese Dog and a burger, usually the same one. It's always hot and fresh, and always tasty. Service can be hit or miss, but there is nowhere in the area you're going to get a burger this good for the price. Period. If their service wasn't so spotty, id give them a solid 5."}
{"text":"Took the fam there on a Saturday night, had perhaps the worst service I've ever experienced. We were seated, and 30 min later no one came to take our order. After I complained to the manager, we got service, but even then the food was very slow to arrive. They had 5 servers, and that isn't a big place. The food is good, but I can't tolerate that level of disinterest on behalf of the staff. Too many other places to go."}
{"text":"The food was great it does taste very fresh and the variety to choose from is good too. The price is especially great $4.95 for three sliders and fries (Parmesan garlic fries are super yummy) the downside was the service it took a while for our server to back around to us and refill our drinks and despite the long line table stayed dirty for 20 minutes and this is why I give a three star."}
{"text":"It's funny how places can never compare with things from \"back home.\" I grew up in Southern Illinois with Steak 'n Shake. We didn't go a whole lot, but it was always good when we did. Every burger joint in Vegas I've been to gets compared to Steak 'n Shake. Fatburger was the closest I found, but still just not the same. Then South Point decided to bring home to me. Great food at fast food prices. Can't go without getting a double steakburger with cheese and fries (only $3.99) and a chocolate milk shake. Yum! It's always clean and the employees are friendly. Thank you for bringing part of \"home\" for we Midwest transplants to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So my buddy was hyping this place big time telling me how great it was, so I decided to tag along and give it a shot. Now don't get me wrong, the burgers were good and the prices are reasonable, but I just wasn't that impressed. Maybe I was just expecting too much, but I didn't find the burger to be anything real special, still it was tasty in it's own right, but I'd probably stick to my beloved Inn N Out."}
{"text":"I waited for 10 minutes with no one even acknowledging me today. The manager was at the register and said nothing. I left and walked across the parking lot to Chipotle for lunch with a restaurant that wanted my business. Don't go to this location"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've been to the Steak N Shake I have been here with my family several times over the years needless to say service is never great but last night was the boiling point. We got to Steak N Shake around 7 o'clock pm and waited 30 minutes to be seated then waited another 15 minutes before anyone came and took our drink orders then waited 17 minutes before we got our milkshakes and another 22 before we got our food now you would think the restaurant was slam packed but it was not there were about four other tables than ours and about 15 people working. I do not know what the problem is other than the time the drive thru and it seems all of their concern for customer service goes to that because it's being reported back to their corporate office. By the time we got out it was after 9 p.m. and everyone was less than happy there was a line to speak to the manager as everyone in the restaurant was very upset with the quality of service. The food wasn't bad but with all of the frustration of service it's hard to enjoy so if you're looking for good food fast go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hate to report on a restaurant I love but they have been out of coffee creamer for 3 days and we just don't understand that when there are grocery stores on every corner!  Why wait days on a delivery truck trying to save money when you're having customers walk out because you won't go buy creamer?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is totally different based on what time of the day it is. If it's during the day, it will probably be edible and not too bad of an experience. If you visit later at night, it will more than likely be a nightmare. The food is prepared a lot differently and the quality is terrible. Also, be prepared to wait a very long time. Don't get your hopes up for a milkshake either. During one of my visits there was maybe 5 other people eating inside and nobody waiting at the drive thru. The lady told me a milkshake would be another 30 minutes because they are so busy. I've been to other locations and they are excellent. Totally different experiences."}
{"text":"Waitress was very kind at the beginning but her attitude declined rapidly. Food was alright except the French onion soup. Couldn't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve. A table nearby had a problem with their food. Waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I only come here for the shakes, they are so good and are always worth the stop. Super thick with whip cream and a cherry. Chocolate is my go to flavor, creamy and thick.   I love that they are open 24 hours, half price shakes from 2-5.. (happy hour) yum!!  Lot's of food options that are super affordable, I had a $4 meal... cheese steak-burger and fries. I'm not a fan of shoestring fries....  Location is right of the expressway, very convenient."}
{"text":"This was the only place when we pulled off that didn't have people waiting we were starving.  We were greeted by a very awesome host with a great smile who spoke to each one of us. Food was ok. My cheese wasn't melted on the grilled cheese burger no biggie. The shakes amazing"}
{"text":"The place was packed when I visited.  The staff were all friendly and the server, even though busy, was attentive to our table.  Steak 'n shake burgers & fries are always a good choice ($4 is a deal).  Their shakes are also really good.  I like that kids eat free on the weekends (dine-in only).  I'll definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible, Upsetting, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!   3rd Time this month, we walkin and are told that we Cannot Dine in because they are short staffed! Other people are seated, we are told to go through the drive thru. We are going to Denny's for now on. THREE TIMES IN A MONTH!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst and slowest service known to the food industry. I am writing this review while sitting on the post order post pay line. I have no words. There where two different people taking my order at the drive thru, after 10 minutes of waiting and then another 15-20 minutes on the post pay line my food came out to me, but of course without the SHAKES. I understand being from New York we naturally operate at a quicker, more efficient pace. But  with that being said this was just absurd. MAYBE if the steak portion of my steak and shake was good I could understand why. You may be thinking why would I wait almost 29 mins for terrible drive-thru? The truth is it got to the point where I needed to see how long this could actually go for. I do give them 5 stars for being able to remind me of how fortunate I am to not have to ever go back."}
{"text":"This establishment is completely disrespectful. It claims to be open 24 hours but that is inaccurate. It's okay to not be open your published hours but we attempted to have a late night meal at IHOP and one of the waiters actually came outside to tell us that we could not come in. I am not sure if it was active discrimination, or a concern about volume but I will be sure to reach out to their management about this. There needs to be a policy about the number of people that they will serve after a certain time at night or they need to decide they are not open 24/7 and begin to advertise it. If treatment of people is reason to choose or not choose a restaurant then this should not make it to your list. Rating to make sure this is put on your radar but no stars would really be the only appropriate rating."}
{"text":"Great milkshakes, great burgers, and great fries!  Exactly what I expected when I walk into the restaurant.  What I was not prepared for was the great service and nice people who works here.  This is our first time at this location and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went here when it first open on the weekday, so no line. This is  a good place to try at least once to try a Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger which is something different. Nice fries. Had the milkshake with meal. Afterwards I could feel the oily butter feeling in my stomach. So if you are used to eating rich foods like butter and fried stuff, then you should be okay with this place. But they do have lot of other variety of food items you can order such as chicken and turkey sandwiches and salads. The restaurant has nice 1950s atmosphere to it and attentive service. IN and Out is still the better burger joint for fast food."}
{"text":"Bad service,  cold burgers.  The bun was good.  Bucket of beer deal was good to bring into the place.   Fries were bland and cold.  The shake was not worth the money and we were given them for free due to the bad service.  The place only had 4 other tables with customers and the people on the other tables seemed to have it worse than us."}
{"text":"Burgers are okay. Fries are too thin, which means they tend to come out crunchy or cold or both. Shakes are decent. Service is slow and often inattentive."}
{"text":"Very good food. Everything seemed fresh and was very tasty. The food came out quickly. The staff was friendly and attentive. Shakes are very good. We tried a few flavors and they were all a hit. We will definitely be back next time we come back to South Point."}
{"text":"I'm giving the drive-thru a 5 today because they earned it. My order was taken promptly and considering they make your food fresh the line went rather fast. The girl at the window was very polite and courteous. My double cheeseburger and fries were both very fresh and tasty. They hit a home run for me today!"}
{"text":"Staff is food allergy trained!! We didn't even require any special handling but I indicated that my son wouldn't be getting a shake because he is lactose intolerant and the waiter let a manager know! She then came over to ask me how severe it is and if I'd like her to scrape any cheese from the grill before cooking his food. They were so nice and considerate of his needs. Now if only they'd add a lactose free shake to the menu..."}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest and this place is not Steak 'n Shake. I ordered the fresco melt. I got untoasted bread and two patties that looked like they had already been chewed into pieces and only were only as big as half my sandwich never again"}
{"text":"This place is cheap. It has delicious food. I like to go here for a nice sandwich ;). Usually not long of a wait and the workers seem pretty nice."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with Steak N Shake from their locations in Indianapolis. They have always been known for their excellent steak burgers and shakes with a diner atmosphere. Their store at the South Pointe stays true the good memories I have of their locations in the Mid-west.  This is actually the 2nd time I have attempted to dine at this location. On the first time, upon arriving, we encountered a very long line to get into the place and turned around and chose another place. On this most recent visit, there was a short 5 minute wait and we were seated in a great, comfortable booth. Even though we had a short wait, the restaurant was very busy, which concerned me about the pending service. Our waitress was excellent, however, leading to a very comfortable and satisfying lunch.  I must say I was initially concerned my memory of Steak N Shake would be tampered by a transplant to a nice, but off-strip casino. Fortunately, they didn't lack on atmosphere, food, or service and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Normally, I have no problems with this location but today was different. I pulled up to get my order which totaled out to be 11.81. In order to get less change back I gave the cashier 21.81. I got my order and pulled off. Being in a forgetful state, I realized I never got my change nor a receipt to state what I gave to the cashier. I had to return to the location and notify them. I was met with an employee who stated \" I counted my drawer and it looks correct\". I was then asked for the receipt I wasn't given which I informed her of. I noticed her looking at receipts that were crumbled up and she came across mine which stated I only gave her 11.81 which explains why I didn't get my change so I guess Steak n Shake was just going to keep my $10. Luckily, I got my change back but from now on I'll be sure to just pay with exact change at this location to avoid any confusion on behalf of your employees in the future with any of my transactions."}
{"text":"First time trying Steak n shack... Wow so amazing! I traveled with a big group and we got an amazing waitress called Lala.  She got our huge order correct. She was very helpful with the menu since we are newbies and made sure she took care of us right away. Food was soo good even for picky eaters which I came with a few. Thanks to SNS I will  make this my new spot!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today. The service was good and fast. The food selection was fun and simple. The menu keeps it easy, nothing complicated at all. You got burgers, dogs and chili selection too. Oh don't forget the milkshakes. If you have a sweet tooth. This place will fulfill that craving. I'm giving it 3 stars only, because you have to get through the casino. If it was a stand alone place. I'd easily give it 4 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again and they said 40 min wait because drive through was backed up... I saw one car in the drier through and 5 people inside."}
{"text":"Cute place!!  Great decor!!  Fun atmosphere.  Fantastic shoestring french fries!!  But they do not have a veggie burger!!!  What's with that??  Hello Steak and Shake management, this is 2015!!!  You need to have a veggie burger on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I have loved this since my first visit 10 years ago. There is no other place I have found that offer the quality of meals for any family at the value of Steak and Shake, me and my family drive about 40 miles to eat here and I truly would love to own a franchise if this company ever sold franchise. In every location I have ate from the food is always consistent and I have always been greated with a friendly smile and polite person upon entry. This isn't a 5 star steakhouse but its most definitely a 5 star fast food drive thru if that's even possible."}
{"text":"First, the good news. The food was tasty. Every other part of the meal was a disaster. My burger was missing everything but meat and cheese. The cheese fries had no cheese and getting the attention of our server was nearly impossible. We tried talking to the manager but he was too busy talking with his friends.   In all it took nearly an hour to feed two adults and three kids. Most of it spent waiting.   This place could be good if the management got its act together."}
{"text":"They got my order correct.  The outside was clean and the people were friendly. Nothing stood out but nothing was bad. Just a normal fast food drive through."}
{"text":"Came in. Didn't hear the worker greet us. He just walked to the table without saying a word to us.. Usually they ask how many and if we need kid menus for our littles. This time, nothing..."}
{"text":"Worst drive through and worst service I have seen.  3 car, no one else in the restaurant and the first car has been waiting 20 minutes so far  from being at the order kiosk. 4 employees have taken smoke breaks in the back and the first car is still waiting.  There is more than enough staff, but none of them are moving and none of them care."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  With the word shake in your name, i'd expect the shakes to be delicious.  I had a mint, cookie shake, I give it 2 stars.  tasted like a McDonalds shake w/ cookie chunks in it.  The burger was decent (Western BBQ N'Bacon) but small.  Fries were of the thin variety.  Service was good and food was up quickly."}
{"text":"We waited for our good for 30 minutes drove all the way back to hotel and had no fries out of 7 orders when I drove all the way back and complain to the manager said he sorry all of the workers in the back are dumbasses! Way to go management you're the one who supposed to teach these children that you hire not allow them to provide horrible service and a nasty location! FYI it just looks bad on you!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family after going to the St. Genaro festival and not eating there. Boy am I glad I didn't because the burgers are delicious. My brother had the the chocolate shake and he said it was the bomb! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When my gf told me there was a Steak and Shake in Vegas I was all about it. We went to check it out and it did meet my expectations, which was surprising. The burgers are not quite \"in n out\" in caliber, but I liked it. Most fast food shakes has a cap limit with my tolerence before I start feeling a little nauseous, but we ordered their half and half Strawnilla shake and it was great. I downed most of it on my fat boy status vacation face stuffing rampage. Our service was pleasant and quick. The only negative was that we noticed the people in the take out line were waiting a while for thier food. So it doesn't seem they're that efficient in that area, but since it wasn't my own personal experience it's not enough to warrant a -star. Good eats at good prices."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, service is quick.  Unfortunately, they did forget part of my order, but made up for it really quickly.  Great customer service.  Elijah was especially gracious and quick to help."}
{"text":"In general I do like Shake N' Steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...  By far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from the east coast and south so I was happy when they brought this chain to Las Vegas.  I will admit the food here is not on the healthy side so if you're looking for a diet friendly establishment, I would suggest going elsewhere. But this is not why I rated this place 3 stars. The milkshakes are awesome as I am a fan of the chocolate flavored ones and they have a huge menu of these to choose from ranging from their regular chocolate, mocha, or Hershey's dark syrup. Also, I enjoy their chili mac supreme meals with a plate of fries.   One of my gripes is that when South Point expanded their casino, they seem to have a lot of wasted space that could've been used to make this restaurant space larger because this restaurant is almost always packed with a long line. However, if you are in a hurry, you can always just order takeout and possibly sit by the deli restaurant tables section or booths both near the sportsbook to eat the meal."}
{"text":"Everytime I passed by this place there was always a big line of people out front (appx 30 minute wait), so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was tasty and cheap, but keep in mind you get what you pay for... It was good though the portions were small. It was decorated cute and the waitress was such a sweet heart. I may return if the lines ever start to die down, I don't wait for food."}
{"text":"I've had consistently fast and friendly service here . Food is always good and out very fast ! Usually I see an employee cleaning up around the restaurant which is a definite plus to me . For as fast-paced as they usually are I am very impressed with how we are always treated :)"}
{"text":"I am usually at Steak n Shake about once a month ... and this time I probably should have skipped my visit.  Food (pancakes) seemed to be tougher and overcooked. Once there was a big black charred spot on a pancake that was about the size of a dime on the top pancake. Wouldn't have been do bad had they tried to hide it by flipping it over and presenting it from the other side.  Service just wasn't there today. More than once my liquids (coffee: & water) was empty before they came back to see if I needed more.  And with the pancake reload order (had the all you can eat deal) my reload order went in before shift change with server #1 and server #2 realised it was my burn spotted pancakes waiting to be delivered to me several minutes later after he figured out I was just sitting there wanting more of literally everything (coffee, water, pancakes).  Normally I'm pestered @ SnS to the point of being annoyed. I wish it was even a little closer to that  Maybe I'll wait longer than a month to come back."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen!  I've been on the west coast for three years now, was really looking forward to going back to Steak 'n Shake.  What a mistake, the quality of the meat wasn't the same and it was burnt.  How do you burn a thin patty?  I love In 'n Out, but it's not that Steak 'n Shake in it's prime couldn't compete rather they've gone way downhill.  I'll give it another try in the future, but what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Visited the drive thru for shakes. The line was about 4 cars deep and it took about 20 minutes to get to the window. Had I not really wanted a shake, I would have pulled away. This is a very busy location so have patience when you visit."}
{"text":"When we got here, we had to wait outside of the restaurant and was told it would be a 15 minute wait- not bad at all. I'm thinking this place must be really good because so many people are there! The restaurant on the inside looks like an old school diner with black and white tiled floors, bar stools and pictures of what the restaurant looked like back in the day.  When we got in, we were seated and the waitress didn't take our drink orders either. Some of the other staff members are really courteous and very sweet though. The menu isn't big which is a good thing to me because it shows they specialize in certain foods and not a ton of random stuff.  When I got my food, I was kind of disappointed- the American patty melt didn't look too appealing at all, it looked sad. Like 2 slabs of \"steak burgers\" with American cheese and Swiss cheese with a smear of thousand island dressing. I got my fries seasoned with salt and vinegar but it mostly tasted like they forgot to put the vinegar in it. My husband got the bacon steak burger and it looked sad as well. It looked like something you order off the menu at McDonald's. He got chili cheese fries instead of regular fries and it had a different taste to it.  All in all, I liked the thinness of the fries and they were crispy, I liked that I could taste the freshness of the meat and the kindness of the staff but I don't think it was worth the calories nor the wait for a \"steak burger \" because honestly, it didn't taste like a steak burger, to me it was a regular burger that I could get for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love Steak n Shake but the Pleasant Hills on Clairton Rd should be avoided at all costs. Drive to the Waterfront, this one ignores you for 15 minutes and it's happened twice. Two strikes, you're out."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, I didn't know my order was called and when I asked if it was ready the one cook slammed my to go bag on the counter and yelled at me for not getting it when he called it. Burger was not that great, fries were good"}
{"text":"Always a line. So we wanted to check it out. Service was ok, line moved pretty quick. Our server was good and there were tons of workers behind the counter. Food took forever, had their classic burger and fries and a chocolate shake. They had no real malt shake. I'm a burger fanatic. This burger was flat, fries dull, and chocolate shake tasteless. I was so disappointed. Jack n the box portebella mushroom burger and chocolate shake is 100 times better. South Pointe resort has a way better cheeseburger meal for 3.95 after 12am. Btw, chocolate shakes were late and came after we finished our meals. Could barely taste the chocolate. Sad to say. With all the minions behind the counter, I felt sorry for them because they were all working hard. I appreciate that. But bottom line. Food sucked."}
{"text":"Messed up my order completely gave me one burger instead of two burgers and the burger wasn't even good. It was soggy and it had pickles which I told them no pickles wasted 11$"}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to blow my burger mind... Unfortunately, it didn't.   There seems to always be a line to eat here every time I have passed by. It isn't so bad when it first opens and people tend to eat quickly since the food is served up so fast. Is it worth the wait? Maybe...  I had the swiss & mushroom burger. It was good. My go-to item on the menu would be the shakes though. For three people to eat one burger and one shake each, it was approximately $32.  Service was also super! I forgot my hand sanitizer and didn't want  to walk out of the restaurant to the casino bathrooms, so our food server got me moist towelettes. Sweet, right? Our waiter was great also! He was super polite and informative.  PROS Cheap Quick service Good service Great milkshakes  CONS Long lines Burgers not as great as everyone claims"}
{"text":"Had a meal here with my family while we stayed at Southpoint...our server was ok, not the friendliest but not rude, just very business like...loved the burger I got especially cause any burger with a fried egg is a pretty good burger...the fries that came with it were also very tasty and price wise, was very reasonable...it's a place i'd recommend for anyone staying at Southpoint"}
{"text":"Surprisingly it wasn't even that noisy with all of the families eating in. Lovely vibes. And the crew is VERY accommodating. The location is amazing as well being that we came right after shopping at Concord!"}
{"text":"Got here because my friend heard good things about it.  We got there and the line is huge.  This had better be good. The place has a 50's diner theme.   For being in a casino, the prices are reasonable.   They have a decent menu the portions are good.  The food quality was good.  Veggies seemed fresh and meet quality good, but that seemed to be it.  Nothing special.  I find in n out burgers to be superior.  They do have some good shakes but nothing worth making a special trip for.  Not bad if you live close or at southpoint for some reason."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and never had any problems. But today was completely different. I arrived 12:15 PM to have lunch with my family. We sat there for about 25 minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order. They completely ignored us so we got up and left. One table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention. So we went to  Wendy's up on 8th Avenue and we had no problems ar all."}
{"text":"I love Steak and Shake! I first tried this when I was visiting Illinois and it was the best thing eeeeever! I remembered seeing that there was one in Vegas. Had to makes stop here! This is inside the South Coast casino! Plenty of parking! Make a stop here and hit up the a outlet that is nearby!"}
{"text":"Why would you open steak and shake and not put chili Mac on the menu??! Not a smart business plan! I grew up on steak and shake as a kid in the Midwest and loved the burgers and chili Mac.    What a big disappointment this place is.  I'm assuming this location is a franchise? If it is too bad steak and shake corporate doesn't make franchisees honor the core standards on their menu. Companies lose customers over product and brand inconsistencies.  If you're going to open up a steak and shake do it right.  I'll stick with Freddie's and in-n-out burger Until you put chili Mac on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Royale is one of the best burgers I've ever had. The steakburger patties were very juicy, it was well seasoned, and they didn't skimp on the bacon. The fries were perfectly cooked too. The price range for the burgers (which come with fries) is $5.50 - $7.50. The Royale was on the lower end at $5.50 which is a very reasonable price for a tasty, filling burger + fries.  The shakes are good, not my favorite shakes around but worth a try. Will definitely come again for a steakburger."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced, and fast service! That mainly sums up this place.   I ordered the Mint N Chip shake and it was just as delicious looking as it taste. I suggest sharing with someone, because this delicious cup of ice cream shake is huge. I probably wouldn't finish this myself.   Ordered the Chipotle Chicken burger, It came with bacon, pepperjack cheese, diced green peppers, and their delicious chipotle sauce. Though, I gave the bacon to my BF and took the cheese out, it was still equally yummy. The burger came with thin crispy fries as well! And at every table, or booth (where we sat) is a section with sauces and seasonings. The fries seasoning was addicting! And if you're addicted enough, they even sell it near the register!  I love that theyre open late! :D super plus.   -0.5 star because they gave me the Chipotle Beef burger instead of my Chicken burger, but they were quick to change it. I wanna come back to try other stuff they offer!"}
{"text":"What horrible service! some of the slowest waitstaff even though there was an abundance of staff standing around and pretending to work.  There was only a few tables seated so there was no excuse!  The food was bad came out room temperature and took too long for fast food.  They got out sides wrong they were out of iced tea the waitress did not know what seltzer/club soda was or if I could order that. I was not expecting much at all especially with the food but at least perk up and make the service decent so people might have a reason to come back. We did go on a Monday evening so maybe not the best staff on the floor."}
{"text":"The food is good. service is good,  but the milkshakes are very bland. I ordered a peanut butter shake.  No taste at all.  They have better milk shakes at the Eldorado Casino in Henderson NV"}
{"text":"Double burger and fries, 2 small milk shakes 40 minutes at 230 pm. The man taking orders told the people behind me it would take 30-40 minutes. I ordered from the kiosk so I asked the gentleman if my order would take 30 minutes and said no it will be out in a couple of minutes. The store is almost empty and the wait time seemed obsurd. 30 minutes later the younger man working the fries asked me how long it had been for my order because he saw me standing there for awhile. I told him almost 30 minutes. He asked the guy taking orders how long until my order was ready and the man yelled at him in front of me saying \"I told him it would take longer than 30 minutes\" I'm standing right there and said to the man don't yell at him, you did not tell me 30 minutes. The gentleman proceed to yell at me from behind the counter telling me he could refund my money and I could leave his store. Never going back to this location. I'm from the.midwest and we have s/s everywhere with a bigger menu and never had service like this before."}
{"text":"I wish I read previous reviews before I went. Sat in the drive through line for 30 minutes! When I complained at the window the girl said everyone was new and they were busy inside. I will never go back here. Not even an apology or an offer for a complimentary milk shake."}
{"text":"Parking is a royal pain in the butt since it is Mill Ave and you either have to find and pay for street parking or park in the lot and walk quite a bit.  The service wasn't great.  Not overly helpful or attentive.  Was unable to add seasoned fries onto my child's kids meal so she didn't get what she wanted.  I tried the Original Double.  I really didn't care for the meat, bread or toppings.  I didn't get what I ordered either... Bun, meat, cheese and ketchup.  There was a huge chunk of tomato on the bottom.  The fries were pretty good - super skinny.  The best part and the only thing I would come back for is the Salted Caramel Pretzel Milkshake.  Seriously yum!  My girls each had the grilled cheese kids meal.  They told me the grilled cheese tasted funny.  I wasn't interested in trying it to see why.  My best guess is they are used to cheese that isn't American so they didn't like it.  A little bummed as I was so looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"Fell asleep last night before I did my review what I can say about this place is their food is good their milkshakes r awesome I had gotten the chicken fingers with fries & a birthday cake milkshake which was delish we got seated pretty fast & our waiter was very polite & professional"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I went there after a night of drinking on Mill and you could tell the workers were down for about anything (especially after I asked the *male* cashier to flash me some titty for beads). Even after that exciting introduction he was super pleasant and accommodating of my paleo sensibilities (no bread, cheese, anything processed or fried).  And the food was good!   Nothing beats good food and good service.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, but could be forgiven if the service was better.  The fries were so over salted I only ate about 2 or 3 before they were discarded.   The employees just don't seem to care!   The guy at the table next to us opened his burger to find everything but the beef! His burger was literally missing the beef patty! Serious lack of attention to detail here."}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you have time to go inside and eat. My dine-in experiences have always been enjoyable... service is fast, food is good and made to order, and the price is right.  However, the last three times I've been to the drive thru over the course of about a year, my order has been wrong EVERY time.  It's not even like I'm making ludicrous requests... one of the previous orders they got wrong was a standard steakburger. I didn't specify anything special.  She said \"everything on it?\" and I said \"yes.\"  Got home and there was NOTHING on it.  Not even cheese!!!    This most recent time, I sat in the drive thru line for 10 minutes just waiting for the car in front of me to place their order.  No one was coming over the speaker to help the poor guy.  Once I placed my order and paid, the girl in the window told me to pull ahead and wait for my order.  I waited almost another 10 minutes before she came out with my food.  What was most interesting to me is when I was still in front of the drive thru window, I could see two employees just standing there with their backs to the grills.   For as busy as they seemed to be based on wait times, I'd think their priorities would have more to do with churning out orders than socializing.  Anywho, one of the items I ordered was a double steakburger without cheese.  The girl at the drive thru confirmed this when I was placing the order and I stressed \"no cheese.  Just lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion\" which are the standard fixings.  I get home and open the order... lo and behold there is cheese on the burger.  Luckily the request was due to preference and not an allergy but it's still extremely annoying to wait so long for your food only to have them get it wrong.  I even checked my receipt and she neglected to enter the request in the first place.  I probably should've got into the habit of checking my food before pulling away, but after 20 minutes I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.    Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I spent the weekend at South Point with my boyfriend and this was our first \"Lets Blow our Diets\" splurge of the weekend. I had never heard of this chain, but it seems to be very popular in the US and was certainly jammed late on a Thursday at South Point. We had to wait to to be seated.  I had a slider trio with different sauces (A-1, BBQ, Ketchup and onions) that was served with fries and my boyfriend had a burger. It was very good and I can see why it's so popular. However, this is not a good place to kick off a weekend after months of fairly \"clean eating\". It's a fatty food grease fest!   The sliders were good, but I think Crystal or White Castle are much better.   Our server was friendly and quick. We had our food within ten minutes of sitting down.  A very inexpensive meal too.  It was a fun experience, but I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good burger, fries and a shake. Well Steak and Shake is a place that keeps things good yet simple, and that's why this place stays crowded. I ordered a classic double cheese burger, fries and a half vanilla half chocolate shake. Everything was so good that we had to take a couple of burgers home for the road.  My personal recommendation is that I found that since the burger patties are smashed, the patties are very thin and crispy; that is what makes their burgers are so darn good. If you like a lot of meat like I do ( lol ;-D ), then I would recommend a triple cheese burger. The triple sounds intimidating but the meat amount is actually equal to a regular double cheese burger."}
{"text":"The service is poor and the soup was saltier than an ocean, to begin with.  All the servers are high school kids. Some who know how to move and press the kitchen, most do not. Instead the hold up the wall. Oh yes, the kitchen. Not everything was out server's fault. The kitchen attacks orders one at a time. Unless they're training kitchen staff on a Saturday night, this place is failing. Our burgers came out lacking everything for which we asked. They returned with no regard to presentation. There were only four tables, gang!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing in my opinion. Good  tasty quality for such a low price. It's located inside the Southpoint Casino. Can be a better bargain and more satisfying than eating at another restaurant in the casino! They have a big shake variety that are all filling. Their burgers are flavorful, especially when you add on those condiments, steak n shake seasoning, and etc. They also seem to take their customer service seriously and positively. If you're staying over night, you can even get take-out. They need more locations in Vegas. But if you're out there in the area, I do recommend Steak n Shake!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here! We were greeted quickly by the hostess and sat immediately. The place was pretty clean. Our waitress was very nice and polite. The food came out quickly. We both ordered a double patty burger with cheese dressed. (Lettuce tomato mayo mustard pickle onion) I really enjoyed my burger! It tasted yummy. Everything was fresh. I opted for the onion rings instead of fries. They were good. My hubby got the fries. They were shoestring fries, which I like. There is also seasoning on the table to put on your fries. Very tasty indeed! My peanut butter cup shake was ok. I expected more of a homemade ice cream taste. It tasted too frozen. It was decorated nicely with whip cream and a cherry. My hubby enjoyed his chocolate shake. We paid at the front. It was quick. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so bad...nice space, great patio, cheap prices, and friendly staff.  The burger and fries were good too!  My only complaint is that they don't serve the full menu at this location."}
{"text":"The hostess (Jenn of Jess, I'm not sure) is atrocious. I am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels, and she made a huge deal of it. I ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know we'd been moved. 15 minutes later, we had still not been moved or gotten food, and my partner and I left. This is 1:45 PM on a Thursday. Not at all busy. Just bad service. Our waitress was very polite, though."}
{"text":"Waited about 15 minutes to be seated, we had a group of 7, service was quick and the food taste great. I recommend the shakes, the Oreo cookie mint is delicious. The price is great and easily affordable."}
{"text":"Not too bad for the price, but the burger was very bland.  I thought perhaps it was comparable to In-N-Out; however, it wasn't even close.  It was a bit dry and the bun tasted stale.  I gave this place 3 stars because of the price and the chocolate shake was phenomenal.  It wasn't too \"chocolate-y\"."}
{"text":"Went to this location today and let me start to say the Manager was great, greeting us at the door and said let us clean off a table for you. Then as they were cleaning the table 2 people walked in and were seated at our table. So we just sat by the door. And another waitress said what do you guys need. We said the manager was cleaning off a table but it just got given away. She said oh you want a table! And instead of cleaning a table that was just vacated she tried to sit us at a table that was left open to allow for wheelchair at next table to have room. The Waitress was VERY RUDE! So we left!  I will never come to this location again!"}
{"text":"Dine in was a really good experience. Quiet, fast service, good was hot, and the prices great. HOWEVER! My second visit was through the drive-tru and let's just say my food was so cold the cheese didn't melt. I was going to throw it away but nope. Took it back and requested a refund without issue. They offered to remake my meal, but that's what I expected in the initial transaction. I give money in exchange for hot food. I'll have to go back for a tiebreaker, but as of now, it's too many options to settle for what they offered."}
{"text":"Cute little place inside Southpoint. Justin and I just had to try it after seeing how huge the shakes were.  Shakes Me: The side by side Chocolate and Banana shake. Compare to Ruby's it was just Ok. The banana part of it tasted a little artificial but when combined it was tasty. Justin: The Turtle Caramel Nut. GOOD! Cant go wrong with chocolate, caramel, nuts in a vanilla shake.  Fries are super thin and are only good when they're fresh. I would say they're a step down from Lucille's shoestring fries.  Burgers Me: The frisco shooters with the frisco sauce on the side. Perfect amount for me and uncomfortably full (but I like that uncomfortable full feeling). Frisco sauce is kind of like a cross between a thousand island and a mixture of ketchup/mayo. Yummy for dipping with the fries Justin: THe original Double and Cheese. He definitely needed the double patty. Even could of used a third if you really want the meaty flavor.  Chili: 5-way. Ive seen a 5-way on food network and wanted to try it. It was good. exactly what I expected from eating spaghetti with chili cheese bean and onion. BUT add some Frisco Sauce and your set! It takes it up a whole other level. To add ANOTHER level: Take it home, put it on the stove to warm up and it up to crisp it up! yum.  Overall, It was a good meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here unless it was for HALF PRICE HAPPY HOUR from 2-4 am &pm. Half off shakes and drink."}
{"text":"What a great little burger joint! This little hidden treasure is located inside South Point Casino and it has the old school diner feel of a  Ruby's. I was concerned when I saw that most of their burgers were \"double patties\" and I was picturing that these were going to be monstrous foot tall burgers that you would need to attack with a fork and knife. Instead, what I found was the perfect size tasty burger that was absolutely delicious in every way. Their double patties together were the size of one regular sized patty at any other burger joint. But, since they make their patties thinner, they absorb a lot of flavor and were just the perfect amount of crispy on the outside... ooo soo good!   Also, you can not leave this place without trying one of their shakes!!! I had their Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate shake and I nearly licked the glass clean. Mmm mmm there's nothing more magical than the combination of a creamy chocolate shake with a juicy burger and shoestring fries"}
{"text":"After a fun night out I was in desperate need of some drive threw yumminess. To start we pulled up to the window and waited and waited and waited. Finally we picked what we wanted and pulled up to the window. The guy inside opened it and we told them there intercom wasn't working they apologized and took our order. They had us pull threw and wait at the front of the place. Once home I opened my yummy burger and took a nice big bite. It was a bacon BBQ burger and it was good but nothing to write home about. My fried were fresh and quite good however Bry said his tasted like they had been sitting for a while. We also ordered milkshakes. I mine was a strawberry shake with a layer of chocolate on top. Well that's what the picture showed it as. What it turned out to be was a strawberry milkshake with a measly amount of chocolate. It was the littlest tiniest bit. So disappointing.  I think it there was a thick layer of chocolate on this thing you wouldn't be able to keep me away. Alas it was not so. This place has potential they just didn't seam at the top of there game this night. Will try again and hope they deliver."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not amazing either. $4 meals makes it a great deal though. Theres a line to sit in and a line for takeout. Ordered the double burger which comes with fries for takeout. Took 5 minutes for them to fill the order. Wished I had tried a shake though but they looked to big for one person to finish."}
{"text":"This is a great stop if you're at the Southpoint for a movie or to gamble. Steak and Shake is a Midwest staple, but they haven't gotten a foothold out west. Their burgers are made from ground sirloin, so they are always juicy and flavorful. They have really skinny cut fries, crispy and salty, and yummy thick shakes.   The menu isn't expansive, just different versions of burgers and a few sides. The shake menu probably has the most choices. But everything is always made hot and fresh for you.   Note - the ONLY vegetarian entree option is a grilled cheese sandwich. This isn't a place for herbivores.   My personal favorites are the mushroom Swiss burger (thick portobello mushroom slices sautéed in butter) and the chocolate covered strawberries shake. Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered the prime steakburger, it was big and good, cheesy, worth it. Their fries have lot to be dedired. Way too thin. My husband ordered the Western bbq burger and it looked a little on the smaller size"}
{"text":"So mad at this place right now, we had a group of 5 obviously fit for the large booth and the host Maria gives the party of 2 in front us the last large booth available when there were tables for 4 open. Very poor resource management on her part. At this point I don't care how good the food is so I give a rating of 1 star."}
{"text":"Total disappointment.  I came out to CES to hang out with my buddy Tony T.  I'm not as kind as Tone.    There was a long line and the fries were horible, soggy.  Even In-in-Out have better fries than that?  Burger was so so and the hot dogs were crappy.  I ordered Blue Cheese with Pepper Bacon (But they ran out of Pepper bacon so it was just regular bacon), Tone ordered a Wisconson, Tinh ordered Spicy, Ed Guacomolie, and Bong had the Swiss.  We shared, and you couldn't tell the difference at all.    I have no idea why there is even a line?  The shakes were good, this gives 1 star.  I had a Mint Cookies and Cream.  I usually never get shakes, but it was the shiet!  Since we were Asians, we were sat all the way in the back corner.  it was pretty depressing.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!  You will enjoy In-and-Out so much much much much more.  + you have to drive so freaking far just for the food.  I would only send my evil X-Wife there.. so she can feel cheated out of her $$ and bitch to her new BF about it.  That's the only reason why I would remember that place."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the day Vegas opens a Steak n shake!! Its something I could only get in the midwest and Im ecstatic! The burgers are amazing, you see the line out front, theres a reason for that! The shakes, the fries, the chili, the beans....everything yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst experience I've ever had at a hamburger shop nothing was done with excellent , the quality of the food was not good i  Watched people walk out waiting for service we finally got a server that took care of us. Thanks Dee the server."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 2 to 3 years now. This place has its moments. Some of the staff are okay. They can never keep the same people. But, there's only one employee that goes above and beyond for her customers. Her name is Trish. When me and my people come every time she gives the best customer service out of the rest. My drink cup never goes empty. If something isn't right with my order she gets right on it. She is very friendly and easy to talk to. The food here is cheap and very good. But there's days where the food doesn't taste  as it should. But all in all I love coming here."}
{"text":"If you like being ignored, this is the place for you. We stood next to the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign for a couple of minutes while the servers stood in a corner, chatted and played with their phones. Finally I approached them and asked if we could seat ourselves. One of them replied, \"No, you have to wait to be seated.\" None of them moved. Two minutes later, one of them found the time and energy to seat us. Our server, Zoe, told us she was new and didn't know the menu. For each burger she asked what we wanted on it. When we replied, \"What it comes with,\" she'd ask, \"What's that?\" We had to point to the menu and show her. Our burgers were lousy: missing toppings, missing cheese, took forever. Then I went up to the counter to pay. Again, ignored. After waiting awhile I approached the group of servers and asked if I was supposed to pay at the register or at our table. They told me the register, so back I went. Finally someone, who looked like the manager, came over. When he asked how everything was, I told him I'd been ignored throughout. Another employee came up and said to the manager, \"It's been like that all day. Three tables walked because they couldn't get served.\" The manager just sighed. No apology."}
{"text":"Meh.. In and out is much better. Been to steak and shakes in the Midwest and are much better menu here the menu is minimal and should rename it steak and shake express. Place was empty and dirty will not be back"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for this place. By luck there was no line to get in. They make the best shakes thus far. I had the chocolate cover strawberry shake. It was perfect! The turkey club sandwich was also amazing. My husband loves the sliders he ordered. It was full of flavor & cooked perfect. The fries are not the best. They are very skinny & small. But the spice that is offered on the table made it taste better. Service was fast & friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE Steak 'n Shake. Glad to see they have one out here since it is usually only in the midwest. Too bad they are way south at southpoint. Definitely worth the trip and can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"This place is so darn good. A friend of mine kept recommending it and it just so happened to be across the street from where we were staying. We ate there twice in two days. The first time we showed up too late to be seated and had to order from the to go window. The second time we were seated and our waiter was incredibly slow and awkward. The food is good. I love the crispy edges of the patties. The milkshakes were delicious. The root beer float had ONE scoop of ice cream in it which was disappointing. But I will be back."}
{"text":"The customer service is lacking here. They need some management to come in here and straighten things up- bad. Don't expect to get seated right away if you're visiting at a busy time and once you're seated, don't expect to be waited on right away. Having said that, come here with that in mind and you won't be disappointed. Steak n' Shake is extremely cheap and is a great place to take kids. My little cousin adores this place which is what has brought me here recently. Chicken tenders and fries for me and a kids meal for her with a half price shake- our bill was just over $10. Not bad at all. I really want this place to stay open, because it's convenient and they get a decent amount of business, I just think the wait staff the staff overall need to have their attitudes adjusted."}
{"text":"Did not live up to all the \"hype\". It was ok, but not Great. I'd go back, but if the line is as long as last time, I'd opt for eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was the best Steak n' Shake I've ever been to. The layout is a little different than what I am familiar with. However, the location is clean, hip, and looks brand new.   The best part though was my burger. I ordered the Original Cheeseburger with Fries. When I first tasted it I thought it could be the best cheeseburger I've ever had. In reality, it was probably the 3rd best cheeseburger ever. The fries were crisp, fresh, and perfectly salted.  I would recommend this location to anyone. The staff was amazing, then prices reasonable, and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I did not like the service. I asked for cheese sauce on my fries and it did not come. It was below average. Other than that the place was clean. I did not get a chance to use the bathrooms so I can not comment on the quality of them."}
{"text":"I moved to the west coast 25 years ago and this was my FIRST stop when I got back in town. Nothing beats a Steak 'n Shake burger with some cajun spiced fries!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the three little sliders and a plain iced tea. I am watching my intake so I could not indulge like my friend did with a huge burger and an awesome looking shake. OMG Their shakes look super great! The sliders were good, did the job, nothing really stood out to me as super delicious or anything and they serve the shoe string French fries that were hot and fit perfectly into my little squirt of ketchup on top of the bag as we ate in the sportsbook because it was too crowded in the diner."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and very surprised at what came out. If  ever in the S. O. M.  center area comes to this Steak N Shake it was very good."}
{"text":"This is not a steak n' shake. This is a burger joint with good French fries. If you love steak n' shake this is sure to disappoint."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ burger and it was good for the price. Nothing special. I wouldn't wait in a long line for it though. Love the crispy skinny fries but the ranch sucked. Lots of shakes to choose from.  This is also not a place to just sit, hang out & talk . When you see the line you kinda feel obligated to leave."}
{"text":"Slow service with an attitude. I go to several steak and shakes around my area and this one is the WORST location by far. Went there on a weekday with 2 coworkers. Had to wait to be seated even though they were not busy. The hostess gave us a very obvious eye roll as she leads us to the table. Our server was young and pleasant but unfortunately not well trained. Our order was taking forever and several tables of people that came after us were eating while we were still waiting for our food. After 45 minutes I went to talk to the manager, Chuck, about our situation. He was very rude and short with me and wouldn't even make eye contact while I was talking. When our food finally arrived one of the orders was completely wrong. My coworker had to go without eating and Chuck said to us he was not going to charge for that meal as a comp to us. Really? The manager had the biggest attitude I have even seen in my life. Even though it was their mistake our order was late and that in turn made us late for work because of his employee (who he probably trained) he was still rude and condescending. Never again will I stop at this joint or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"After growing up in the midwest and frequenting Steak 'N Shake, we were excited that it finally came to Tempe.  While it is not the full service restaurant that we are used to, the burgers are still flavorful, and the fries are great.  Happy that they finally have one here - will go back for sure."}
{"text":"My children love SNS so we have made several trips here.  Our service has always been pretty good.  We've only had a negative experience once, and our server brought it to the manager's attention without our asking which was nice.  The manager was very nice and apologetic over the length of time it took to receive a 3 stack of pancakes (60 mins). and comp'd our entire meal.    I don't know if anyone goes to SNS with high expectations, but it's always been average or slightly above for us."}
{"text":"Arriving in Streetsboro, OH, from Moline, IL, after 8:30 p.m. and a long days drive, we wanted a place to relax for dinner. A restaurant still serving that would be more than fast food. Steak 'n Shake down the street from the Fairfield Inn seemed to be the answer. We had seen quite a number of them in the midwest. (They are not in our area at home.)   Steak 'N Shake is a table service restaurant open 24 hours a day. This location is convenient to the Ohio Turnpike, I-80. It does not have the full menu of a coffee shop such as Silver Diner, but a similar ambiance. A variety of interesting burgers are on the menu along with salads and other sandwiches. I was in the mood for a salad and ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad. It was quite a good sized salad and made for an ample dinner. (I could not resist also ordering a small side of French fries. These were thin shoestring style French fries and yummy.)  Steak 'n Shake is famous for its Milkshakes. I saw a few guests ordering them. They are huge!. Not for me but I'm certain shake lovers would love them. :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that my favorite Missouri hotspot my friends and I always hung out at was coming to Las Vegas, especially around Christmas.  My own personal present.  I was promptly disspointed once then twice again.  The first time I went I had the mushroom burger and a chocolate shake.  I must say that the shake was awesome, just like I remember, the burger was absolutely awful.  The amount of grease is still a remembrance, but I was thinking, first week I will come back after Christmas to let them get settled in, again I was very dissapointed, the burger were very greasy, and underseasoned again.  I understand the burgers are generally that way, but its supposed to be in a good way, these were definitely not.  I got the patty melt this time, my fave, and it was just awful, no tasty steakburger patty, or yummy cheese.  But the shake was just as good though, mint chocolate chip, although we got it way after I was done with my burger which was a bummer.  The service here pretty much sucks too, both times I went they forgot my water to go with my shakes, and I asked for it twice the second time I went.  Water is supposed to be pretty much standard when you just have a shake, but whatever.  I tried it twice and I think that we will just go back for the ice cream, if we want to wait in line. Ugh!  Maybe the owners need to go back to the midwest and get some little midwest welcoming spirit and not the buffet crap food that las vegas is known for."}
{"text":"uh, wut?  I tried to come here after flying in late night to CLE Hopkins and needing a bite after a long flight home.  Nothing else was open in the area and Steak 'n Shake's \"OPEN 24 hours\" sign was shining like a beacon on Lorain Avenue.  First we attempted to go through the drive-through but no one answered. Ok, let's go inside, we thought.  When we attempted to open the door it was locked.  Staff saw us attempting to enter and refused to make eye contact.  Another group approached and were equally flummoxed after jiggling the handle to enter--a guy in the group threw up his arms with disdain and yelled \"what's the point?!\"  My sentiments exactly, guy.    Maybe this place is run by a bunch of apathetic teenagers over night but management needs to get it together.  If you're closed then turn off your sign. Shameful. It felt like the twilight zone."}
{"text":"Was watching games in the South Point Sports Book. Got hungry. Wanted to get some Chicken Tenders. Went to the Del Mar Deli... $9 for tenders... WHAT?!?!  Walked to Steak N Shake. Got the Tenders for $5. Cheap, fast food, that's good, inside a casino. Where else do you see that?  Shakes are expensive but very good. Try a Double Chocolate Fudge. You're drinking fudge. Mmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"There's only 3 requirements for fast food.   (1) Fast (2) Cheap (3) Good  If you meet 2/3, I'm likely to visit your establishment. Steak and Shake currently falls short of all 3.  (1) Fast   I went on opening Sunday. They decided to open on a weekend where asphalt replacement closed the drive thru and you couldn't park in front of the store. Bad decision.  When I go to other fast food places (Chick-Fil-A, In-N-Out, Raising Canes, etc.), I see employees working hard to make sure that they give the customer good service. These restaurants are who Steak and Shake will be competing with in the area. Training multiple employees on the job and only opening one register to save costs sends a message that you're cheap and don't value service. Bad decision.  There were only 6 people in line when I arrived, which extended to the door. After 5 minutes, only one customer had been served, and after 10 minutes, I left as the line wasn't moving.   I tried again the next day and luckily the drive thru was open and there was only 1 car in front of me. I still waited ~10 minutes for a shake. It just wasn't a good roll out. Hopefully it improves in time.  (2) Cheap  I paid $4.29 for a shake. There were non-specialty shakes for cheaper. Prices seemed similar to other fast food establishments, but I didn't order food so I have no idea how much bang for your buck you get.  (3) Good  I had a peanut butter cup shake. There wasn't anything special about it. I was expecting a ton of peanut butter cup chunks, but was disappointed. They used to have a double chocolate fudge shake that was amazing, but that is off the menu.  I'll try it again, but I'm skeptical of a place with bad management. The Yelp reviews are highly questionable (virtually all the 5 star reviews are from people with less than 10 reviews)."}
{"text":"Double steakburger with cheese and frisco sauce on the side. Cheese fries. Hand-dipped milkshake."}
{"text":"This is not a real Sns!! They suck and they never follow their schedule! Always closing way earlier than the actual closing time! Always!! At least 25 minutes earlier!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Steak 'N Shake was when I visited Orlando, FL in 2004. Looked for them all over California but they have yet to expand that far. Imagine my surprise as I pull into Las Vegas and see a sign that there is one right in South Point! Couldn't wait to check in and head over there. It seemed to be very popular as I had to wait in line for 10 minutes, and the line was just as long when I finished my meal. And the remainder of the week too.   The mushroom burger was awesome, and I loved the Side by Side milkshake! Banana on one side of the glass and Strawberry on the other!  One thing that I liked is that was a little different than your regular burger joint is that you can choose a salad as your side instead of the standard fries and the burger is not made with ground beef but a thin steak with no meat fillers. So all the burgers had double patties but were not too much to eat. Seeing the double patty scared a few folks. I could hear them asking \"can I have just one patty?\" It must happen a lot because the waitresses had the answer to satisfy them.  Can't wait until they hit the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"Just herd the cook tell the waiter to not bring the food back. If you do I'll spit in it."}
{"text":"My husband could not have been more geeked that there was a Steak 'n Shake in the hotel he was staying at for a business trip in Vegas.  He grew up on this stuff in the Midwest so seeing it on the West Coast was an unexpected treat.  I had the mushroom and swiss burger and he had the western bbq burger.  I'm proud to say that it was the best mushroom and swiss burger I've ever had.  Something about all the flavors melded together just worked.  Most people would think it should just be like any other burger, but something about it definitely set it above the rest.  Hopefully they'll open one up closer to us here in Northern California.  Please, please, pretty please.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I still love this place. Staff is friendly and the food never disappoints! I'll be sad when I move and it will no be close by."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. McDonalds-tasting burger, so greasy I threw away the bottom bun. The fries tasted like Pringles--I don't even know what you would do to fries to make them taste like that. Wound up throwing them away. Husband liked his shake. Service was sloooooooow. It was a Friday night, but only three employees including the cashier. The room filled with people waiting. Took 15 minutes to get two burgers, two fries, and a shake."}
{"text":"This is my late night snack spot while in Vegas. Tasty burgers and fries (love the chili cheese ones) ,and shakes . The wait is sometimes long because it's a popular place but it's worth it and the food is very reasonably priced . The only thing that could be improved on is the service ."}
{"text":"Okay its burgers.  What can you do to a burger?!  Well they have a brunch of ideas, and the sick bastards did it to hot dogs too!  The burgers taste fresh and stay juicy.  The fries are thin and get cold if you don't eat them quickly.  Stay for a shake, the split kind makes the decision much harder.  This Steak and Shake is newer/nicer than the Parma locations.  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas, I was extremely upset there wasn't a steak n shake here... Steak n Shake was my all time favorite dining back home in Michigan. One day, while I was driving, I saw a billboard that said  steak n shake was opening soon at south point location... FINALLY!!! boy that got me excited!! I finally went there and the dining area was FULL and the lines were soooo long, but I didn't care! I was so determined to get my strawberry shake and chicken tenders!!! My husband wanted to eat somewhere else, but I made him stay with me :) and we ordered take out instead of waiting in the extremely ginormous line to dine in... then we drove up to the top of the parking garage, and ate on the rooftop while taking in the awesome views thanks to my hubby's genius idea... I guess he's good for something :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Thursday morning with hardly anyone seated. Took a few minutes for someone to come seat us. Once seated took over 10 minutes for someone to greet our table."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews anywho  THIS B***H IS FLAT OUT RUDE. IF YOU HAVE ANY MORALS AND COMMON SENSE DO NOT COME HERE, DINA R if you do not enjoy your place of employment then please take your disrespectful behind somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service isn't to great at this location, the lady who took my order seemed angry that she had to be there.   Food is good though"}
{"text":"The patties they use must fall from heavens farm house. Those things are seriously that good. Combined with the perfect amount of condiments and absolutely amazing shakes they earn an easy 5 stars in the arena of classic American grub. The prices are crazy cheap considering they are located inside of a casino.   I went in with the family one day and couldn't decide on what i wanted to order, so i ordered two meals. HA! Don't tell anyone :) I ate the royal burger like it was my last meal on earth then slowly enjoyed one of those gourmet hotdogs. I decided to go with a half and half shake and combined banana and chocolate. After eating myself into a temporary food coma the bill arrived and i felt guilty. I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed such a serious meal at such a comical price. If you have kids they get hats and cool cars to color as well.   If your in the area of the south point you absolutely have to try this place. The only bad thing I can say about Steak n' Shake is the fact that sometimes you are forced to stand in line and wait. Standing there smelling all of that awesomeness is not easy."}
{"text":"The western bbq burger with the parmesan fries are pretty damn amazing!!! My shake was perfect! Not too thick and not too thin.  My servers, Melinda and Gaby were very nice and took great care of us."}
{"text":"The main reason why I still like this place is because of their milkshakes. The quality of their food is almost like McDonalds."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but there was so much hype I had to try it out. The burger seemed very greasy and the bun was basically inedible by the time you got to the bottom. I upgraded to the chili cheese fries and was disappointed by the amount of chili it came with. Also, what \"combo\" doesn't come with a drink these days? The inside seems stale with not much personality and the service was just ok. Maybe next time I'll try a shake, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Although the lines to eat here are always pretty long, the wait is never too excruciating. The atmosphere is really cool with its retro 50's look and their burgers & fries are super tasty. The shakes are awesome too. From my past experiences, 2 people can both order burgers & friends along with specialty shakes for no more than about $20. Which ultimately makes for a nice, cheap, reasonably split bill."}
{"text":"Even with a big group of 7, and a busy Friday night, we were still sat within 20 minutes.  I ordered the jalapeño  burger without salsa. It was spicy without being overwhelming. I loved the crispy onions on top. I also ordered a classic strawberry shake- thick and creamy. Get the Parmesan herb fries as your side.  It was a quick, tasty burger place. Not gourmet by any means, but good burger."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly in love with this place. Mainly an East Coast staple, Steak 'n Shake finally opened a location close enough to California -- in lovely Las Vegas. As soon as we saw the sign advertising it on the 15 freeway, we knew no matter what, we had to make a trip to this place that's relatively off the Strip.   So how deeply am I in love with their food? Well, for once, I downed two burgers plus shake in a sitting and took one more to go. When Andrew went to Vegas a week later, I had him bring back to Los Angeles two more burgers for me. Obsessed? I think so. =)  The first burger up was the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger. I'm not a big fan of onions, but I gobbled up the entire burger, onions included in no time. The two Steakburger patties were not overcooked (just perfect!) and the melted butter and cheese made the nice connecting bridge from the meat to the toasted bun. Addictingly good. Only downside is no green veggies.  Being a guacamole/avocado freak, I had to order the Guacamole Steakburger (pass on the raw onions) next. The guacamole is freshly made and smothered over the two meat patties. Adding in a couple of the thin and crispy fries that come with the meal is a fantastic idea! Another great burger.  The strawberry classic milkshake was thick, creamy, and oh so good! Very much so a classic. Now that I got that down, I'm up to try their side by side shakes, where you can pick two flavors to combine in one glass. Imagine the yummy possibilities!  I have to praise our server for being so wonderful and patient. After being seated, we had ordered only two burgers up front even though we knew we would consume more. We didn't want the second order of burgers to go cold while we were inhaling the first, so we ordered the second ones later. Then, we added in our shake orders. Thirdly, after having three different versions of our receipt, we added in our burgers to go. Really, kudos to our server for being flagged so often to add something in and to change our receipt.  As a testament (what, my review wasn't enough??? =]) to the amazing food at Steak 'n Shake, lines to get a table in the restaurant run about 45 minutes, maybe more if on a weekend. They don't call numbers or put down your name and party size, so you feel like you are in line for a theme park attraction. At least at the end of this line, instead of a 2 minute coaster ride, you get 30+ minutes of deliciously joy!"}
{"text":"I have lived in SoCal most of my life except for a few years in Illinois when I was younger. And I'm so lucky I did, first off I love the snow, and second... Steak 'n Shake. Oh yummmm... But then I moved back to OC and missed SnS :(  Then I found out about the LV one!.... my family literally took a trip to see a comedian for a night and have Steak 'n Shake. It was everything I remembered and more:   Two burgers, fries, chili, and drinks/shakes later I was satisfied. Could've eaten another one if I wasn't afraid of going into cardiac arrest on the spot.  *Hoping they bring them to SoCal! But it's always fun to have more excuses to go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"STEAK N' SHAKE! STEAK N' SHAKE! I have been here a few times and always enjoy it, they screwed up a milksake order once, but fixed it. I took 7 other people here once, all who had never been to a Steak n' shake and they all loved it. Could not believe how cheep it was for what you got.  My friend from NYC said that what the 8 of paid for would get you a dinner for 2 in the city."}
{"text":"Stayed at the southpoint for two nights last weekend. Friday night after seeing a show in the showroom we walk over to Steak N Shake and they were closed... we got there at 1:15am and they close at 1:00am. No Problem.  Saturday night we returned.. knowing what time they closed and got there 12:35 and were greated by a rude skinny little girl who rudely told us the dining room is closed, but we can walk up to the carry out window. We wanted to sit down and eat in your dining room, and you didnt close for 25 more minutes. Epic Fail. Will not return.   Btw we are Las Vegas locals so dont bother to write us off as disgruntled tourists. We arent. Never going to attempt to eat here again."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has mostly bad reviews. Came here with the family and the service was very efficient. Our server took good care of us and we tipped well as a result. The food ... it's fast food. If I had to find something to complain about, it's the fact that I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it came with, literally, a sliver of bacon about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Otherwise, it was not an out of ordinary experience. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.  Granted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.    While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.  When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.  All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again."}
{"text":"This place is the worst steak and shake ever! Took like 20mins to be seated and then another 20 mins to take our order. The hilarious thing, there were at least 5 employees not giving a f*ck. They all stare at you with this stupid look like what are you doing here? HELLO! I want a freaking burger. Apparently there arent any pens at this place either because our waiter went looking for one for like 10mins."}
{"text":"What a joke. Stopped in at midnight for a couple shakes and sandwiches to go. Walked in to major attitude. I'll be with you shortly, or not..  after waiting for 6 minutes and took care of two cars thru the drive mr personality still did not ask for our order. Ok, we were traveling for 15 hours and I thought this was a good idea. When I asked the short order cook advised that he would get to us \"when he could\". What does that mean?  Never mind, sorry to bother you to do your JOB. Will not bother with this place anymore. Management are you alive??"}
{"text":"3 stars  I grew up in Ohio as a boy and remember going to Steak n Shake many times as a child. When I heard they were opening one at the South Point I got pretty psyched for it.  I really, really wanted to love this place since it makes me feel a bit nostalgic, but it can be very inconsistant. Some days are great, others...not so much.  The prices are fair and reasonable. The burgers are okay, but can't compete with In N Out or even Five Guys. You could do much worse though.  The service is very hit or miss. I've had days where it was outstanding. I've also had a couple of visits where I wondered if I would even come back. It gets a little busy and it seems like some of the staff just throw that whole customer service idea right out the window.  If you happen to be at South Point and you've already hit the Del Mar Deli and want to try something else  than it will do, I guess. It's just nothing to go out of your way for.  Last year when I was in Florida, I hit a Steak N Shake there and it was GREAT! Too bad it doesn't seem to translate out here. Shame."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Service is fantastic and David the manager, he rocks!"}
{"text":"I tried this place 3 times thinking and hoping it'll be better next time. It never got better and if anything, it got worse. The food is decent for its price. But I leave this place angry every time cuz of the service. The employees are extremely slow. It was like watching a video that was constantly buffering. It was painful. You can visibly see how slow they were moving. Not to mention orders were wrong sometimes. Students are looking for something fast when dining at the SU and this is just the worst place to go if you are short on time. Props to the guys who was doing the cooking cuz he was the only one genuinely working. Everyone else should he restaffed. Just awful. Not surprised reviews are so bad."}
{"text":"Had some of the worst service in my life by far. Ordered very simple meals for three with no special requests and one milkshake. After 45 minutes, no food or milkshake and no stop by for refills.   Not sure if it was because we are a gay couple with different race children or just complete incompetence but the other guests who came in at the same time were served, fed, and were checking out by the time we left - completely unacceptable.   Asked to speak to a manager and was given excuses as to why her staff couldn't handle two burgers and a grilled cheese. Will be calling corporate."}
{"text":"Out of 3 orders, 2 of them were delivered 1hr after ordering! Totally unbearable The only explanation was that the system shut down and loose all the orders and especially mine!! Last time they proposed me a shake and my money back but it no getting near to what I wanted: just a burger and some French fries!!! My conclusion Don't order after midnight!!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from St. Louis and love Steak 'n Shake.  Unfortunately, my experience at this location was extremely disappointing.  It took probably 15 minuets to get seated even though half the restaurant was empty.  Ordered a cheeseburger & fries & a shake.  My girlfriend ordered the Frisch melt & fries.  When the order came we were very disappointed to find out that they were not the shoestring fries that you normally get at a Steak 'n Shake.  We also asked that the fries be cooked crispy/well done.  They were not crispy!  The Frisco melt is supposed to come with a toasted sourdough bun.  That bread was barely toasted.  We were told the manager was going to come and talk to us, but they never did.  I wanted to show my girlfriend that Steak 'n Shake is better than In & Out but this Steak 'n Shake was the worst fast food establishment I have ever been to.  This place was highly unorganized and needs a reboot!!!"}
{"text":"Place is a TOTAL TRAIN WRECK!!! How does corporate let them run this shit hole as they do? It's beyond a mess.   FILTHY  SLOW  MEAN  IGNORANT  UNCARING   I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT MY ONE EXPERIENCE HERE TODAY.  Never going back. Not a reflection of 90% of Sn'S franchises. This was the kids first visit and at 15 I imagine they will never go into another Sn'S in their lives. First impressions do that..."}
{"text":"I had Frisco Melt. Terrific. Service fast. Waitress very good.   Stopped at Wendy's first. Disaster. Should have guessed when people sitting at tables waiting for food. Heard the \"1\" clerk. Say \"I need change\" and nobody answers.  5 people in line yet. I had to leave. Just wanted quick burger off I-277.  Across road was Steak n Shake. Glad gave town one more chance. Now I'm relaxed and tummy is Hsppy"}
{"text":"If you want steak n shake dont come to this location.  The service is so slow your food is cold by the time you get it."}
{"text":"I came here again, but this time it was just me and my boyfriend. We were waiting around for a party to start and decided that we would come here since we were both kind of hungry.   When we turned the corner to where the Steak N' Shake was, we were greeted by a tremendous line. My boyfriend looked at me and said, \"oh hell no.\" But I remember that you could get things to go, so I told him that we should just do that and go eat it somewhere in the casino. We went up to the hostess and told her we're just getting something to go and she let us right in.   There was only one person in front of us in the togo line, which was awesome. We knew there would be food at the party, so we decided we'd just get a little snack. That little snack turned out to be a Chili Cheese steak frank, Guacamole steak frank, 2 sides of fries, and 2 large sodas.    We only waited for 5 minutes tops. I told my bf to make sure they put the seasoning on the fries because I didn't want to miss out on that. He checked the bag and sure enough, they didn't. We went back and asked the lady at the counter for some seasoning and she said they didn't have any. WTF? Umm, they were only open for a few weeks at this point. No seasoning...really? There was a whole mountain of seasoning for sale right next to us and she said they didn't have any. We ended up walking to another woman at the counter and asking; she gave it to us right away.   Since we got our food to go, we had to find somewhere to eat it. We ended up sitting at the little food court area where the ice cream and coffee place is. There were a few other people doing the same thing, so we didn't attract too much attention.   We opened up out hotdog containers and dug in. Both of our hotdogs were delicious! Combined with the fries, this meal definitely hit the spot! We probably ate everything in about 5 minutes. I don't know why, but the food just tasted so much better than the first time we came here.   All in all, 4 stars for the food and speedy service, minus one star for the \"lack\" of seasoning."}
{"text":"It's not the same as we are used to ...  High priced boring burgers and fries Bacon burger was nothing special  The shakes were okay- is why 1 Star   What the heck was the new owner thinking? No Onion Rings  No Coleslaw No traditional thin burgers   Zero reason to ever go back   Huge Disappointment !!  Interesting... management tells me to try the dollar menu at mc donalds   Sir take a look at yourself and simplistic replies to all the disappointment from guest  perhaps you need to apologize to each and everyone that's had a poor experience  I'm going to forward the rude response you made to me - want to bet Corporate won't be thrilled  We will continue our support for Steak n Shake at the SouthPoint - they treat customers with respect and have an awesome staff"}
{"text":"We stopped here during late night pokemoning because my nephew wanted a shake. He decided on the Nutella one and it came out really good. I only got the smaller size strawberry shake...nothing \"fancy\". My shake you could tell was made earlier and not picked up, was then stuck in the freezer, and then served to me. It was easy to tell that the shake was frozen because the whipped cream wasn't on top, but had been smashed into it and the cherry was frozen, plus it had a different lid. My hubby works across the street and will be told to not ever come here again."}
{"text":"The food is good. Better than you'd expect even. But this is the third Steak 'N Shake that I've been to and each one has slow, slow service. I am giving up. I even came knowing its be slow. I had no place to be. I thought I could wait. But this visit was like the restaurant from hell. Except the food was good. I don't want to blame the servers as they seemed to always be working. But somehow the setup of the operation has refused to even try to learn anything about efficiency."}
{"text":"I have always liked the atmosphere of this place, it feels like an old fashioned diner. I mainly come here for their awesome milk shakes. The burgers are always good, so is the service. The lace is always clean no matter how busy they are. I have never been disappointed. And price you pay for food is pretty good too. They never disappoint me here."}
{"text":"3.9 stars  I heard of about the restaurant from a friend when we left Vegas. It's in the middle of West Coast, past the buffet. The restaurant style is similar to Johnny Rocket's. The first time I was there, we waited outside for about 20mins. I got the portbello and swiss burger. It came with fries. It was pretty good, and I finished it quickly. The fries were ok. I prefer In n Out fries over Steak 'n Shake.   The second time I went here, it was before noon around 11:30pm. I never got inside. The expected wait time was an hour and I was on a schedule to get back. My group decided to not wait and went to another restaurant.  - 0.5: Wait time. It varies so sometimes it's good and other times it's horrible. - 0.3: Fries. Not my favorite type. Kind of bland - 0.3: Service. Pretty hard to get someone's attention"}
{"text":"Purchased the Original Double 'N Cheese burger combo for around $7. Was disappointed with nearly ice-cold pickles and tomatoes which made the rest of the burger cold upon eating (only a minute or two of wait time between eating and receiving my order). The patties had more crust to them than actual meat. The overall quality of the sandwich rivals a fast-food chain's value menu."}
{"text":"This was our family's first time to Steak 'n Shake and jus heard that they had some really delicious burgers.  It can fit quite a few people and very comfortably.  We didn't wait at all for a table.   When we sat down at our table we looked over the menu for a few minutes and then the server came to take our order.  I had a regular American burger w onion rings which I may say was awesome and with a little of those peppers made it hot but outstanding.  My husband chowed down on his philly cheeseburger and fries and my son gobbled down his western burger and his butterfinger milkshake.  We also ordered a chocolate shake to go which was so thick and yummy! Maybe minus the maraschino cherry as we don't care for it and forgot to tell them not to put it on.  Our fault.  Overall our experience was great and would definitely be back again and bring our daughter as we left them at home in Hawaii.  They would love this place."}
{"text":"Nathanial was a great server! We arrived a few minutes before midnight and thought they were open until 1:00 a.m., but they were just closing. He was gracious and rushed our order of cheeseburgers, fries and a chocolate strawberry shake. He brought our drinks then the food immediately after. Wow! Very fast. Everything was delicious. It was my husband's first time eating there (I've been to their restaurants in Indiana) and now he know why it's our son's favorite restaurant. Inexpensive, classic diner food with real dishes and table service."}
{"text":"I went to Steak n Shake wrecked with a massive hangover and looking for the greasy burger we all know and love. I order my #15 bacon cheeseburger meal and pulled away to crawl back into my apartment. I opened the bag to find my bacon cheeseburger lacking any hint of grease, topped with the works. It was an amazing burger. The toppings were fresh, the bacon thick, I only wish it was greasier just this once. However after eating it I felt immensely better so maybe it's about the food and not the grease? Five stars. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I really don't know if my review for Steak 'n Shake is going to have much relevance, due to the fact that I had neither steak or shakes.  So yeah, this is pretty weird. It's like the time I went to the Cheesecake Factory and ordered some Chinese food and complain it didn't taste very good. Maybe I should've figured out that their specialty has less to do with Chinese food and more to do with their actual restaurant name (It can't be factories, so it must be cheesecakes, right?). I can't tell you about their cheesecakes because I didn't have any. Whoa, anyways, sorry for going off on a slight tangent.  I can assure you I wasn't as brainless this time, and I originally planned to eat some steak until I saw their hot dog menu. I ordered their Chicago dog, and because I had some wine a couple hours ago I thought a shake wasn't necessary. I was conscious of my decision and yearned for something out of the ordinary.   I ate their Chicago dog with a side serving of fries. Gotta say it was pretty damn good. The color of the relish was unbelievable. I actually didn't even know it was relish until I tasted it. It was so diced to the point it looked like a completely different vegetable. The fries were killer as well. They were thin and crunchy, kinda like the ones from McDonalds, but not drenched in oil nor salt.  The place was jampacked and the waiting time was pretty long. In the end, however, it was all worth it. I definitely want to go again in the future. Maybe next time I'll be normal and actually order their specialty."}
{"text":"Don't let the line discourage you, as t moves pretty fast.  Came here on a Friday night with about 10-15 people in front of me, but still was seated in roughly 15 minutes.  Steak 'n Shake is not a new rodeo for me, I'm used to the stand alone locations which have a little more appeal to them (windows, lower ceilings).  The food was pretty much as consistent as I remember, I went with my go-to Frisco melt and banana shake.  The shake was awesome as always and I gobbled up all of my shoe-string fries.  I'm also impressed that the menu isn't given resort prices, as you can still get 4 combos for under $4 (recently named one of the best dining deals by Vegas Seven).  If the line wasn't as long, and not in the casino, this place would get 5-stars no problem."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for a place where two people can get a good meal for around $15. That and they're always sending us fliers and coupons in the mail almost every day - one can only hold out for so long. The burgers are always tasty, gotta love those shoestring fries, and when it comes to milkshakes they know what the hell they're doing here (I know, it's just milk and ice cream, but still).   This particular location is clean, the servers are friendly, the piped in music is benign and there's a claw machine in the corner. I almost forgot to mention they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Holy God this took forever! I get pissed and stand up to realize my food just chilling behind the counter. Fries, cold as fuck, that's OK, they're nasty as ass anyway. The best part is there's a little ticket that shows what time the order was done..5 mins it sat there. Chuckbox. Always. Never forget."}
{"text":"This is our absolute first stop on our way into Vegas.  The burgers are perfect for me. I do not like a super thick patty and these are just right. Their produce is fresh and the burgers always juicy and packed full of flavor.  The seasoning is top notch and we always buy a bottle for the road.   The milkshakes are awesome, lots of flavors to choose from and VERY thick!  The fries are yummy, be sure to put seasoning on em. I always forget to get them with chili and cheese, but this last time I remembered...!   Their menu is pretty big to be honest, however we always get burgers, fries and shakes. Duh!  Order your food and hit the slots or go grab a beer. It'll take a few minutes but its totally worth it.  We've never had a bad experience here. Not with the food, the service, price, wait, nothing. It's surprisingly very consistent."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good. Would have liked a little bit more SMASHED CRUST, especially from a place that inspired the likes of Shake Shack! Salad was on point though. Iceberg is back."}
{"text":"Always a great experience every time we go here. Although, often packed, there's always friendly service. Regardless if you're dining in or taking out, the burgers are always fresh. Fries are crispy and the shakes are delicious. I live close by and this is THE BEST burger spot in my side of town."}
{"text":"Everything is good here... from shakes to their burgers! ! Overall service and the burgers are tasty and fresh!! Will come back for more!!"}
{"text":"You know this place is sort of touch and go. One of my all time favortite foods is simple chili. When you get it while eating inside steak and shake does a really great job. When you get it to-go though it's another story, like tomato concrete maybe. Maybe it's the accountability to quality when ordering in house, who knows!? The burgers are always pretty reliable and high end for the fast food market. Lots of variations on the classic burger also, which rotates semi-seasonally.  The milkshakes are sensational! I remember this last christmas they had a candy cane milkshake! I was so excited, it was amazing.   One other signature here are the fries. They're a run of the mill fry, but extremely long and slender, almost like straws. Next time I'm in I'll snap a photo for you guys on the droid.    One other nice touch is when ordering in, you get a waitress which is odd but great for a restaurant with such a low price point.   Robert Ebert was quoted saying steak and shake would be his preferable meal before death. While I think he's bats*** crazy for saying this it beats McDonald's, and I will continue to return when in a pinch. Worth trying out.  3 stars  PS- Apparently they have a 4 dollar all you can eat pancake breakfast, I sooo need to check that out, and you should too. Also if your a kid, or even not you get a free steak and shake paper 50 style hat! Who wouldn't want that! Just ask for one."}
{"text":"I have had wonderful experiences and terrible experiences. Sometimes the staff is extremely attentive, and other times they seem to ignore you. Their food is definitely wonderful and worth the drive all the way down to the south point, but the wait staff needs more guidance."}
{"text":"LITERALLY THE WORSE FOOD PLACE IN ALL OF PITTSBURGH. I would suggest to go to the chik fil a or McDonald's right beside it. Every worker is RUDE. Even if you place a to go order thirty minutes ahead of time THEYLL STILL MAKE YOU WAIT ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES. I was waiting for a cashier and every worker, about 8 of them, walked past me INCLUDING the manager and finally I had to speak up after about 15 minutes say If no one is going to cash me out I'm leaving, then the manager very rudely told me to wait while she finished her text.. literally the worse. I work right by this place and even with how many times I've been there they still seem to just mess EVERYTHING UP. WORSE SERVICE EVER"}
{"text":"Review for LUNCH  So... hearing that the line can be a bit insane... we went early... got here around 11:40am for lunch... only had to wait like 5 minutes.  Service: We were seated, our drink order taken and our drinks served very quickly.  I was very pleased with the immediate attention.  Menu: Since this was our first visit, we gave the menu a good once over so it took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted to try.  The server was very nice and came back a couple times to check on us while we were pondering our choices.  Lots of choices... I was surprised.... from burgers to dogs to sandwiches to a few salads to chili and a few other miscellaneous items like chicken strips.  Ordered... and only waited like 10 minutes and our food was out... QWIK BABY! And it was HOT.  :)  I ordered the Guacamole burger, the other 2 in my party got the Buttery Wisconsin and the Chicago Style Steak Frank.  Portions were RIGHT ON!  Not too big so that you waddle out of the place but just big enough to be filling.  Now... the pictures make the burgers and dogs look like they are going to be Gi-Normous when they come out but they aren't.  Don't be afraid to order... you can always cut it in 1/2 and bring it home.  My Guac burger was very juicy and tender.  (I don't know that I would order the Guac burger again as the Guac had too much onion and green peppers in it and not enough Avocado taste.)  The bun was light and fluffy.  The fries were thin and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  And they serve lots of fries with their order... easily can be shared.  Didn't try their shakes as I'm lactose intolerant... but they looked heavenly.  I'm living vicariously through all those folks who I saw slurping away with a smile on their face.  Price: For 3 people.... at lunch.... $17 w/o tip....   We Will Be Back!"}
{"text":"Burgers from Hell!   Waited 10 - 15 minutes in the drive thru where they have signs saying \"Quality takes time\". While waiting I was hoping that would be the case and was day dreaming and imagining my juicy scrumptious Portabello and Swiss burger to be heavenly, what I received was not even close! It appears they have the parents who killed Freddy in A Nightmare on Elm Street working the grill and tonight they must've had a bad case of PTSD. They completely burned the patties! They have my time and money but did not come through on thier end of the deal. I guess their idea of Quality is burnt burgers  and that's why it takes so long cause they burn the Hell out of em! The meal was anything but \"Quality\"!  It was gross! I won't be returning. Now Freddy will probably be in my dreams Damn!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place. My fiancé and I walked in, it was busy, got seated right a way, quick glance at the menu, m&m shake and the bacon and cheese double steak burger for me, tea and chilli for my fiancé.   The smell coming off the grill made me queezy so I dipped into the bathroom for a few moments, moments turned into  20 minutes, walked out, glass of water, and our food but no shake.... Um.... Usually the drinks come first.... So we twiddle our thumbs for 10 more minutes  bc I'm sick, so I decide to try a frie, they looked hard, swear it chipped my teeth, it was hot thou. Finally the shake comes, I ask for a box and To go cup. We paid I didn't tip.   At home after my tummy recovered I ate. Burger was great bacon chewy, great smokey flavor, awsome that's a star, the shake amazing, massive clusters of m&ms that's now chocolate but that's ok. There's another star.  Service was ok, it was busy but more people on the floor would be better. But they did their best."}
{"text":"Poor. Miserable presentation. Food tossed  together. Used to be a good place. Not meeting stake and shake standards. I will not return"}
{"text":"I love this place good service and staff really good fastfood burger place. I love it so much I'm here again."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience that we have had.  The burgers were paper thin and bland.  The cheese fries were basically cheese whiz over fries and not very good.  The worst part was a server named Octavia that practically freaked out when my husband brushed his arm to get his attention since he ignored our call of excuse me. We will not be going back nor would we ever recommend this place to anyone.  Stay far away."}
{"text":"Two weekends ago, another couple met my husband and I at Steak and Shake just before going to see True Grit (which was great, by the way); we had heard so much about it and we're hamburger people so we wanted to see what the buzz was all about.  We allowed plenty of time before the show, because we heard it was going to take some time to get into the restaurant - that was true, we were 25 minutes in line. This included my husband, who (uncharacteristically of a Las Vegan) will not stand in line for food.   After being showed our four-top, we waited another ten minutes before being approached by our waitress who only gave us two service setups with our menus. She disappeared for another 15 minutes, and finally came back to take the rest of our order.  \"Steak\" and \"Shake\" - so we tried to order shakes, but our waitress, whom we had told we were beginning to get tight timewise before the movie, told us that it would take at least 20 minutes to get the shake because they were so busy.  So we ordered iced tea. She took the order and went away.  Ten minutes later, my husband noticed that a party which had been far behind us in line was enjoying a tableful of shakes.  He complained to the manager and we got a toffee shake in about three minutes.  It was good, but just as good as the toffee shake you can get at Geri's Cheesesteaks on Pecos where we go often and really like (i have to check and make sure we have reviewed them!)  Fifteen minutes after THAT, we started to get antsy.  I noticed the couple which had been right in front of us and seated next to our table had not been served, and I looked around and it was plain that NO food was coming out of the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, we finally saw our waitress and asked how much longer it would be and she promised \"ten more minutes!\" Ten more minutes would have been ten minutes before the start of the movie, even if we missed the trailer and we couldn't wait anymore.  We asked for our check and my husband went up to the counter to pay for our drinks and our one shake with the other man in our group.    Not only did we have to pay for the drinks and shake, but the manager treated the guys like they were nuts for the fact that we had to leave.  I would have liked to try the food - if it would have been good, I would have said so honestly, but we didn't get that opportunity.  I'm sorry, Steak and Shake won't get another shake from us - I have better things to do with my Sunday afternoon than wait for food I don't get. Therefore: one star, and I've never left one star before."}
{"text":"I'm going to concur with the other Midwesterner's review of this SNS. It's sort of an oasis in a land of unfamiliarity. It's also not your typical SNS. If you've ever been to the Midwest, you know these joints are all over the place like most other chain restaurants and with some the same pros and cons. If you're some sort of hamburger aficionado then let's face it, you're better off going to one of your $30 a plate, high falluting snobby restaurants to get a 5 star burger. SNS is probably 3.5 at best but I personally believe they're a cut above the other chains simply because they use actual steak and cook it right there in front for everyone to see, not to mention they've kept the processes the same since the first one opened in Normal, IL (ironically, where I attended college). This one is a bit different. The menu is SERIOUSLY stripped down. As in, two burgers to choose from, a sandwich and some hot dogs. They still have shakes, but not the side-by-side I've grown accustomed to. And as a final con, this one didn't have the table top seasonings for fries or the hot pepper juice you can shake on your food like all the others do. And those are honestly my only complaints about this place, otherwise I'd say it's the best one I've been to, and here's why. The decor of all the other SNS's I've been to is exactly the same at every one, very diner-ish and really boring. This place is a lot more modern and with outdoor seating. The very first SNSs back in 1956 served fried chicken and beer. This one at least serves beer, along with a few different wines. And finally, the service was spot on. The girl who took our order was pretty outgoing and admitted when she messed up. I got the last of the Dos Equis keg so got a half a beer but then they brought me out another one for free because of it. I'll probably come back here again with that kind of service."}
{"text":"This place if filthy! There's lots of trash under the tables. I ever told the young lady at the register that you guys may want to sweep under the tables and got attitude from her. The food was blah and the waiter was no existent once he took our orders. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in at 10pm... not many people were in the restaurant, however instead of someone welcoming us in and then sitting us, we waited and waited... Then finally after I'd say 6-7 mins and the servers were done talking to each other gossiping, one walked over and greeted us and sat us at a booth. Then we sat for almost 10 mins waiting and talking and then our server came over and said, would you like a drink and we ordered 1 coke and 1 coke zero. She repeated our drink orders and walked away.   She came back almost another 10 mins and asked us if we were ready to order our meals. My friend ordered a foot long with only ketchup and fries with a garden salad and Italian dressing. I ordered a chili 3 way (spaghetti with chili sauce) and seasoned Parmesan cheese and herb fries with a garden salad and french dressing. Once again she repeated the order and then was like \"did you want fries with your order\"? she looked at us as like I'm dumb can you help me?, left and we sat there talking.   We waited for 15-20 mins and not one thing was brought out. Our server was in the kitchen then walking around before returning to the serving station to grab our orders. We saw no salad but our meals already to go to our table. She came out to bring our order and my friend says wait a minute thought we were suppose to get our salads first. She responded oh i think i saw one, but reluctantly walked back and finally brought out our salad and switched our ordered salad. She asked would you like another coke to my friend and he replied not right now.  We ended up eating our entrees first before our salads. then we waited and waited for our server to come back but apparently she vanished off the face of steak and shake. she was serving another couple across the booth we were in and we over heard her apologizing to them for some reason.   She finally came back some time later and brought our bill and she asked would you like another drink and you had a coke right? We finished eating and paid our bill and the lady was politely nice.   If you want to eat at steak and shake go to the streetsboro steak and shake not here unless you want to starve or have your order messed up or wait till you are old, then come here."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!!  Hope your not hungry when you eat here!  The burgers are SUPER thin!  Don't go with a group of more than 6, they have ONE table that can seat 8 or 10, otherwise they split your group up.  They wont put 2 tables together.  They insist on trying to fit everyone in their booths!    Now, lets talk (lack of) customer service.....the hostess (doesn't matter which one) is extremely rude!    So glad we're not \"tourists\" cause this place would turn me off of Vegas!  There are MUCH better places out here to eat at.  Five Guys & Fries and Freddy's just to name a couple!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late night milkshakes and was greeted by Tyler who was so pleasant, funny and outgoing. He definitely is a great personality to have greet your customers! Not to mention my Oreo milkshake was delish - definitely skipping DQ for Steak and Shake from now on!!"}
{"text":"Soda drinks were flat. Told the server and she kept saying she took it off the bill like it was a huge thing. But first she asked us if we wanted taken off the bill.. yes lady we don't want to pay for flat drinks we didn't even drink. All 3 sodas were like sugar water. Service was slow. Food honestly tasted like gas station chicken sandwich and burgers. We were a group of 8 and all of us were very disappointed. Be warned there are A LOTTTTTT of kids so expect obnoxious teenagers and loud kids. The one Star was for the shakes, those were the only good thing from this place."}
{"text":"Great food.  The quality is the same as the others in the mid west.   This place is usually always busy, the wait is not too long even if there is a big line.  Price is very affordable."}
{"text":"It's not one of my fave haunts. I heard about their shake from a friend. I thought it was just OK. I prefer McDonald's or In & Out's Milkshakes."}
{"text":"One of my father's favorite places to take me. It is alright. I hate waiting in line though for this place. That is one of my only complaints. The service is good and their milkshakes are tasty. The burgers are alright, but not my favorite. They aren't big, juicy, sloppy, totally messy burgers and that is what I love. They get the job done though. I enjoy the mushroom one when I am there. I tried their chili cheese hot dog and wasn't impressed. Stick to the burger and milkshakes. I'd much rather make the trip over to 5 guys though and pay a few extra dollars to get my iron fill. They also have a togo window off to the side if you call ahead or you can even order there. I'll take some of their milkshakes to go. mmm"}
{"text":"The food is what it is. Burgers are good and chili is sometimes dry and like paste. My major complaint is the service at this place. Just plain horrible, almost every tim i go there."}
{"text":"I was really happy that my mom suggested going here. We don't have it here in Los Angeles (as far as I know). We had to wait for about ten minutes to get a booth, but it was worth the wait. I ordered the sliders. I enjoyed it, because I got to pick a sauce for each little burger. French fries were crispy and I received the ranch that I requested for dipping. I also had a birthday cake shake. It was really filling and really tasted like what it said. They had a ton of different shake options to choose from. The place is pretty cheap too. I like that it is full service."}
{"text":"We came here during our stay at South Point and found it very interesting.    Located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino, it had the oldies diner feel to it.  It was kind of bright in a sense, but very nice looking.  The staff were nice and friendly and seated us very quickly.    It was kind of interesting that you can mix match the milkshake into one cup.  So I tried the Chocolate Strawberry milkshake.  It was kind of cool that they could keep the strawberry on one side, and the chocolate next to it.  Mainly have to go and see it for yourself.   Of course being the first time here, I wasn't really sure what to try, but the basic single burger.  Which was really good and decent.  Made me think of trying more the next time I stop by.    Overall, its a unique place to check out.  If you're a milkshake lover, then you should check out their milkshakes.  Their burgers are decent, and maybe want to experiment with what they have out there.  Sure enough I probably will, the next time I have a chance."}
{"text":"Im a South Point regular so I have eaten at S&S countless times.  The service is always friendly and attentive and the bugers are sooooo good.  For $3.99 you can't go wrong.  I have the double when I go.  The lines are long but its worth it and the value makes it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Whether this place was in a casino or not, this place serves some of the cheapest burgers in a sit down place that i can think of.  The patties are really puny.  Think McDonald's kid burger patties.  I need at least a 3 patty burger to be satisfied.  The fries are very standard skinny fries. No frills.  Overall it's not a horrible burger but there are far better options to go to.  The shakes are pretty good though so maybe that's what brings the masses in.  I frequent this place alot b/c my coworkers enjoy it.  I won't turn it down because it's so cheap.  Value-wise and for those who frequent Southpoint, it's definitely a great bargain"}

{"text":"It's the milkshakes that I get when I go out to visit my elderly father, who likes a good malted chocolate shake.  At this point, I get shakes to go -- one for him and one for me.  I try to take advantage of Happy Hour, 2:00-5:00 pm, when shakes are half price.  I have always enjoyed my shake.  My only complaint is that it takes forever, it seems, to get something as simple as two shakes-to-go, when it is not a busy part of the day.  This happens frequently."}
{"text":"You got to be kidding me? What do people see in this place at all except for their shakes? There were three of us and we eat a lot of burgers but this place was not even better than McDonald's!!!! Also had to wait in line for this terrible burger and couldn't even eat it, the fries were not even good! Why do people go to places like this I don't know?"}
{"text":"Overrated ..food was ok ..Dissatisfied with people saying its the best no its ok milk shakes tast like  McDonalds nothing big.."}
{"text":"Pulled through the drive Thur & they said there was a \"15 minute wait\"... continued to wait and had terrible service."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. There should be a no star option just because of this place. BTW this is the first review I have ever done, but very much needed because of the various bad experiences we've had here. My husband & I have been here MANY times, and the service never gets any better. We try our best to look past it, because we love their ultimate banana ice cream shakes.Lol UNFORTUNATELY that's the only sweet I ever crave, but we always make sure to get them \"to go\" to avoid their crappy service. Out of the many horrible experiences we've had, the first time I ever visit this place was unforgettable.Lol The hostess was incredibly rude right off the bat. Every time someone went up to ask her something she had the worst attitude, and continued to roll her eyes. She made us feel as if we were bothering her by asking for seating. It's ridiculous. Being that I work In the food industry(Waitress), we were appalled that someone like that would choose to work in this field where the quality of service means everything. We felt totally unwelcomed. I proceeded to speak to the manager after 20-30 minutes of waiting to get seated, yet other groups of people who arrived after us continued to be seated before us. The manager seemed very nice, apologized, but immediately after our conversation we saw her laughing and talking to the employee we had just made a complaint on. Every other visit after has just continued to go downhill. I will say we have had good experiences with 2 of the male waiters that work there, but that's about it. My step son came into town last week, and being that he loves burgers and ice cream we made the ridiculous decision to give it yet another shot, and dine in. Worst mistake ever!Lol Our waitress was so rude, and rushed us into making our order. We let it go, and tried to enjoy our dinner. She then came with our food and gave my husband the wrong order, and when he let her know he didn't place that, she proceeded to argue with him that he ordered that?!Lol I got really upset, but again I stayed quiet. My husband told her to forget it, she picks up the receipt, takes a look at it, and realizes he was right, and blames the cooks for everything when she was the one to argue with my husband in the first place. We were so upset, but continued to let it go. After that incident she didn't bother checking on us at all after that, but very quickly left our receipt on our table without asking if we needed anything, ran off before we can get a word in, & again ignored us for the remainder of our meal. (Keep in mind we still wanted to order our shakes for dessert)That's when I had it, and spoke to her about her service. She was very sarcastic, & defensive to say the least, but didn't bother to ask to speak to a manager because it's obvious they don't care about the service we are given. (Speaking from past experiences with speaking to them) It's just not worth it for us anymore. The food, & desserts are great and affordable but the service kills the whole experience. I  can't understand how half of the employees even got hired. My only advice is to go with the male waiters. You have a better chance of having a good experience."}
{"text":"We took our four kids to eat here today. The bathrooms were revolting, worse than a busy truck stop bathroom. The drink counter/station was not much better, it was very filthy. We sat down at table and it was dirty also, we had to get some wet napkins to wipe it down. The whole restaurant just felt and looked really dirty. On the upside the food was really good. We ordered five various burgers, a footlong hotdog, chicken fingers, and shakes. The kids loved the food. We would go back and try it again, and hopes that it was cleaner."}
{"text":"I have received poor customer service on multiple visits here. Most recently, it was the drive thru service. There were very few cars in the parking lot and I was the only one in the drive thru. I was told that it would be \"one second\" when I drove up. That was fine with me. Someone finally asked to take my order five minutes later. After I pulled up, it took another 10 minutes to get my food even though I was not waiting behind anyone. The guy at the window began an awkward exchange when he reached out with the food to my car window before asking me to pay and not letting go of the bag until I pulled out my card. He then went back inside, forgetting my drink, so I waited until he noticed that I was still there so that I could ask him for that, too.  My fries were cold, so the wait wasn't due to them having to make them fresh, and the burgers were pretty awful as well. I am rating this location 2 stars instead of 1, because on some visits the burgers have tasted alright."}
{"text":"This location has been a hit or miss. It always seems empty when we pull in the lot. Few tables full at any given time.  I do like that kids eat free on weekends.  It does take forever to get service from the kitchen. So far the servers have been attentive to take the order but it seems to take forever in the kitchen. Drive thru is a joke. To get a milkshake your better walking in.  YES the milkshakes worth it.  The burgers are good most of the time and I really like the string fries but not when they are COLD.  Breakfast - Don't waste your time, other better breakfast spots in the Waterfront."}
{"text":"Today at 4pm..Horrible service and rude manager when I asked if I could have my shake I orderd. It took an extra 5min to make and it had a black hair in it so threw it out. The inside of the place was dirty and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned and tables were dirty and stickey. I got the Frisco Melt and the patty looked like some one had smashed it or stepped on it.. Low grade dog food. Not even comparable to Freddies!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my 4-year old's favorite restaurants. Anytime when we are in Gastonia, maybe about once a month, this is her number one choice, probably due to her love for milkshakes and macaroni and cheese. I don't complain, though, as I've always been a steak and shake fan. This is a pretty decent steak and shake. I've never had bad food here. Sometimes the service is slow but everything arrives hot and fresh. The prices are good, too. I really like the taste of their burgers and some of their specialty burgers are pretty good. The fries are great, too, particularly with the garlic and Parmesan seasoning."}
{"text":"Visited today after getting a Christmas tree, after not having been here for about 6-7 years, and I must say, it was more than a bit better than in years past.  It's still a greasy burger joint, but the burgers were pretty tasty, inexpensive, and quick.  Shakes are still, in my opinion, pretty meh for a place that has the word \"shake\" in their name, but they're serviceable.  All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"I love Steak n' Shake, but the one in Champaign is slow and the service is horrible. They are not friendly or welcoming. They don't like to help you and they take forever. Even the drive thru is slow."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place you could eat in Vegas. The only thing worse than the quality of the food here is the service. Please do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"45 minutes for a mediocre fast food burger and fries? did they drive somewhere else to order it and pick it up? stay far away. even McDonald's is better than this."}
{"text":"Before I write a review on this place, I want to point out that there is no way in Hades that this location is on Ridge Rd. I've been here many times and it is actually on a little road that winds around behind the Target and sits fairly close to the Giant Eagle on Day. How exactly this place has an address on Ridge is beyond me but I'm pretty certain I'm not on the happy gas today.... and no, there isn't another one that I'm not aware of.  Anyways.... Steak N Shake is one of those places that you'll likely get stuck visiting if you have young children. I made the mistake of taking my son on a date here long ago and that has translated into it becoming his \"favorite restaurant\" and hence one that I am obligate to take all of my begging children to whenever we go out on dates.   I don't particularly dislike S&S but can't come even close to claiming the food here is great. They do exactly one half of their name right - the shake. They make a fantastic milkshake in a million different varieties. The 'steak' part of the name is another story. There are no actual steaks here (apparently burgers and steak is the same thing to someone) but rather very small, cheap burgers. None of them are especially tasty either.  Basically I go here because I love my children. And actually, I quite enjoy it when I'm there.... only because they love it A LOT. That's good enough for me. There is nothing that will bring you more joy than seeing the smile on the face of your little squirt while he wears a S&S hat and puts together one of their free paper cars.  It's cheap and fun for kids so I'll probably spend many more dates with them here in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, we came here to grab a quick bit and ordered 1 burger and fries. 45 min passed and when I asked to see how much more it will take the waitress came back and told me 20-30 more min. The place was empty! So when I told her I think we might go somewhere she said ok I'll cancel you order and stormed off.   I mean, I guess I can't expect anything more from a place like this."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes when I think fast food I usually think this. This restaurant is a great place to eat. The service is a 7 and the food is a 9 I love to come here when I can ps. This location is by pets mart and it's kinda hidden"}
{"text":"Whenever I was at the waterfront I would eat here.  The shakes are good, as are the shoestring fries and baked beans.  The sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double.  Overall, pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This particular location seems to change servers like a woman that changes her purse. They can never keep the staff the same here. I mean I know I've seen a lot high schoolers working here and all. Food otherwise is very good usually, they always accommodate you with there awesome shakes, especially the seasonal milk shakes."}
{"text":"I've been to few different locations and this one in Parma, at least for myself and the wife seems to be the best out of all of them. We get seated within a timely manner order is taken quickly, shakes are brought before the meal. The staff just seems more friendly then any other locale, I've been too, but that's based on opinion.  I'm maybe a little bias on the location, I grew up in the Parma-parma hts area."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled portobello and Swiss steak burger. I frequently visit here so I knew what to expect in terms of customer service and food quality."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars based on it being the best at what it does.  It's a fast food, cheap burger joint which competes with In n Out, McDonalds, Five Guys, etc. I personally put Steak n Shake at the top of the list. In n Out probably beats everybody in terms of freshness.  But it lacks in choice. Steak n Shake has a great menu with a lot of choices and all of their burgers are top-quality ground steak with fresh buns.  Ever sandwich comes with fries and everything is less than $7. But what puts Steak n Shake at the top of our family's list are the milkshakes.  SO good.  Especially the dark chocolate.  I haven't had a better one at a 'chain', so I recommend everybody give it a try while in Vegas (as its the only tone in the Western US)."}
{"text":"The staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at 2:02 pm \"It's only 1:59 you can't do the happy hour shakes yet!\"   She literally screamed it at me.   The management does not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either.   I too, have witnessed employees not washing hands, and I have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burgers.   Once - shame on you, Twice - shame on me - won't go there again.     The lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doesn't help either when you have kids."}
{"text":"Inside the South Point casino, Steak 'n Shake has lean, thin burgers.  The burgers are so thin that you definitely want to order a double.  The edges of the patties are nicely charred and crispy and  I love the shoestring fries and huge dessert menu.    The decor is '50's style burger joint.  This place attracts a good size crowd, so be prepared for a little wait.  The prices are super reasonable with a good size $4 menu."}
{"text":"I love their portabello mushroom burger. It comes with garlic mayo, onions, mushrooms & swiss cheese. I ordered mine without onion and american cheese.  BOMB! Our waitress was really nice and attentive. Merlinda? I'm horrible with names..."}
{"text":"Pretty sad. I can honestly say this is top ten worst burger joint I have been to. The bread stale. Fries are tiny shoe string greaseballs. Burger grease is unbarable. Banana milk shake is awefull just artificial flavoring."}
{"text":"Long story, short the competence of the arrogant hostess was enough to all but ruin dinner for me and my friends as we were forthright in telling her we'd have at least 8 for dinner...no problem, she said, then after seating us, and our 8th & 9th guests showed, we were unable to fit everyone and they refused to let us pull another table or chair to ours and they last two just opted to leave.  Manager backed her staff up even though she said I was right that they could and should have accommodated us.  Food was average, and after the fiasco, we were billed in full.  Thanks, you lost two customers and multiple future customers tonight!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and my favorite thing about it is the fact that it's the most affordable place to eat at South Point. The prices are great ($4 meal deals), but the food on its own is really bland. Plus, you'll probably have to wait a long time for it.  The main problem I have had with this restaurant is their cleanliness. My first time here I was served a glass with a red lipstick stain and on my second visit there was a large orange stain on my cloth napkin. Guess you get what you pay for?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. What a great value. Not kobe beef but tons better than any fast-food but just as inexpensive and the shakes can't be beat! We live here and go at least once a month."}
{"text":"We waited for almost fifteen minutes in the drive thru for two milkshakes. After finally getting our shakes, we are halfway down the road and realize that the peanut butter shake is actually chocolate, not peanut butter. Being that we were pressed for time and had already waited fifteen minutes, the disappointment sunk in and we realized that they screwed up our order. The one milkshake that they got right was okay, but nothing super special. Perhaps our funds and calories would have been better spent at the neighboring ColdStone Creamery."}
{"text":"We tried Steak 'n Shake a couple weeks after they opened up last year. We loved the food and couldn't wait to go back but the drive from our area of town (NW) is brutal. Since our first visit, we've been there a handful of times and the trip out there seems to be less worth it each time. Maybe I'm crazy but it seems like the burgers get thinner and smaller every time we go. I tried the Jalapeno Crunch burger during a recent visit  a few weeks ago and I was extremely disappointed. The meat was dry, the bun was dry and the toppings just didn't meet the flavor they portray on the menu. My wife got her usual which is the Wisconsin Buttery burger and even she questioned that visit. Maybe it was just a bad night? If that's the case, they are having a run of bad nights when we visit.   We ate at Steak 'n Shake again last evening with some family and it was just disappointment again. The food comes out dry, the fries are flavorless without the seasoning and their service is terrible. Our waitress confused some of our items with the table beside us, brought some of the wrong items and was just overall slow and rude. I don't know about others but I hate having to waive down a waitress for a drink refill on a cup that's been empty for the duration of my meal. If you see that your tables cups are empty or very close to empty when you bring out the food, you should automatically be working on refills or at minimum, asking if the customer would like a refill.  In my opinion, Steak 'n Shake only deserves 3 stars for these two reasons...the chili and the price. Their chili is amazing! It's meaty, flavorful and they always bring it out nice and hot, piled with cheese and onions (if you like it that way). Every time we visit, we grab a few cans to take home. If you ask me, it's some of, if not the best chili in town. And their prices are great! You can easily walk out of their for under $25 with 3 people. We will definitely go back but they need to work on quality control and customer service."}
{"text":"Finally A Steak N Shake in AZ! Still as great as I remember. I moved to AZ 3.5 years ago. Here you walk in and order which is different than any other one I've been to. They have a stripped down menu which is why only 4 stars. But they have steak burgers, Frisco melts and foot long hot dogs and of course shakes. This location has Beer and Wine. Say What!?"}
{"text":"Stopped here at 8:00 on a Sunday night, if you know Brunswick, you know it's not a hot bed of activity at this time of night. This store was no exception. 10 minutes after we were seated our waitress took our order. 40 minutes later still no food has been brought out. I have no problem, waiting for a good high quality dining experience. You know the type of place with chefs trained in the best culinary schools, linen table cloths, fine wine and the finest desserts. This in not one of those places, it's a fast food burger joint. The key word is fast. If you can't make a hamburger in less than 40 minutes you don't deserve to be in business. You're no better than a clown, a king or a girl named Wendy."}
{"text":"Seriously unsatisfied. I have never written a Yelp review, however I felt inclined to discuss how mediocre this sad excuse for a Steak 'n Shake is. If you ever been to a REAL Steak 'n Shake then I urge you try anything else on Mill before you enter through those doors of disappointment. First problem, it's not a real Steak 'n Shake. Steak 'n Shake has hosts, waiters, and waitresses. This one does not have any of those things.  So your probably thinking, what's the big deal? Is that really why you hated it? Of course not, I could look past it as  I sink my teeth into a juicy Prince of Royal steak burger, however my pallet was not greeted with such a fine piece of culinary cuisine. (The prince of Royal has a fried egg on it and when asked if it could be done, I was told no. I should have walked out but I had to stick through it.) No, I was instead greeted with 1/4 of the menu which did not include this succulent burger. Honestly, It looked like an airport version of Steak 'n Shake with half the menu missing. Also, the burger was not that good and the fries were pretty terrible. Oh, and it's not 24hrs or even open late at all, again, a staple for what makes Steak 'n Shake so awesome.  Don't get me wrong, I love the steak n shakes of the Midwest so please, if you are in the Midwest and you pass a Steak 'n Shake, try it, you will love it's friendly staff, excellent food, and even better prices. I am so mad because my expectations were very high and I was sorely let down. P.S. - Went back to try a shake, those are great."}
{"text":"Ah, Steak n Shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. Open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. You're faster (and cheaper!) than Eat N Park. Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. Granted, if we were at a fancy party, I might act like I don't know you, but deep down inside you know I heart you."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. We got here and our order was taken by Morgan. We didn't see her for 30 minutes after that. Our food was brought to us before we got our water and our milkshakes. We got our check and went up to pay and still had not gotten our milkshakes. We went up to pay the bill and were standing there for 5 minutes before being acknowledged. We paid our bill and after that we received our milkshakes. Before paying the bill we asked how much longer because its late and we didn't want to wait and she laughed at my table and I and said \"I don't know.\" One would think she would know because she was standing in the back the whole time talking and hugging someone who also worked there neglecting us, all other tables and the people waiting to be seated. Anyway, we took our milkshakes to go and on the way home my sister said it was wrong. So I turned around to have them fix it. I told them it was wrong and they told me I was wrong. I think I can tell the difference between a cookies and cream milkshake and a fudge one. I asked if it would take another 30 minutes and was told no. But what do you know, we waited there for 25. Glad to get out of there and never come back!!"}
{"text":"Dear Jeebus...one of the bestest drunkie burger I have ever tasted. I knew I wanted to try this place out on our recent Vegas trip and after several hours in the sports book at Southpoint with my significant other, we tried out the Wisconsin Burger and some shakes. First of all, the Wisconsin Burger. Hello! Double meat patty with cheese, smothered with Wisconsin butter? I lost all self dignity and calorie counting for the day. It was, hands down, a great burger. I got the mint Oreo cookie shake and it was delicious, I made the boyfriend take a picture of me loving on it, it was that good. He got the turtle shake and commented many times, in graphic detail, how much he was enjoying it. Sorry to other with poor/bad servers but our server rocked, we were in and out of there in 25 minutes, with full tummies. These are the types of places I am glad are few and far between because I would be a chunky monkey if this place was around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"I was so excited that they put a Steak 'n Shake so close to where I work and it's on the way home as well. I was excited until I got there.  The restaurant is just off the casino. Smoke everywhere. Open 24 hours, I arrived around 11:30 pm. The place was messy, very messy. From no one at the host stand where the sign stated wait for seating, to items on the floor, to tables that had not been bussed. Finally got acknowledged and seated. Server breezily came by and said she would be with us in just a moment. The restaurant was not busy.That moment turned into 6 minutes. We left. Also the menu was quite different from the South Point restaurant. I was told by the counter server that \"we are franchised so there are some liberties\".  If I have a craving for S&S I will drive down to South Point."}
{"text":"Been here twice -- once in the afternoon and once late at night -- and haven't had the problems others have reported. Service has been fast and friendly and the food good. I've had a burger and fries and a shake both times and can't complain."}
{"text":"First time here, the wait outside of the restaurant didn't take that long which was nice. The server got busy after we sat down, she was nice but, kept everything short and sweet. We felt kind of rushed to order but, we understood.   We both ordered the Steak Shooter which is basically like 3 steak sliders. You can order them in different varieties and I ordered one with Ketchup and Onion and the other two were supposed to be the Garlic flavor. On top of that, I ordered a Heath Shake.   When the food and shake arrived, it looked like any other fast food place just served on a plate. The fries had no taste and the steak was thin cut and greasy. The shake was served with a spoon and straw but, the consistency wasn't thick so, I didn't need the spoon. In addition, the \"Garlic\" flavored burgers didn't taste like they had any garlic at all. I'm not sure if perhaps she didn't take my order correctly or if that's how they were supposed to taste because they didn't taste like anything but plain burgers.   I honestly would've been happy eating an In-N-Out burger and fries just with this type of setting. I love the theme of the restaurant and wonder if this is how the burgers and fries tasted back in those days because if it was then, I wouldn't be so disappointed.   All in all, I gave the place three stars for 1) Fast service 2)The decor and 3)my shake actually tasted like what I ordered, Heath. Would I return to this place? Maybe if it was the last place to eat in Southpoint, other than that, I'm fine with In-N-Out."}
{"text":"In a genius move, the Steakburger folks have taken to cooking the burger until it's crispy! Then add some pickle and mustard, and that's a simple, cheap, tasty burger.  The fries were nothing to write home about, but did I mention ultra-cooked meat?"}
{"text":"This place is awful and the gave us a rotten shake we had to send back then said they would remove it from our bill and added it agin and over charged us . Then said they would send out the manager who wouldn't come forward or look at us and handed his card to the register to a worker to avoid us . While I did think our server was nice and attentive the food here is so awful I didn't eat mine . This place is worse than McDonald's and the flavor ? Where ? Don't go save it for a better place"}
{"text":"Good cheap burgers. Nothing fancy but it sure hits the spot. The meat is decent, probably 1/3 lb in size. The fries are okay. DO NOT put a s*** ton of their seasoning salt over your fries, like my boyfriend did. You'll just end up with a over seasoned, salty mess. I don't really enjoy the seasoning salt because there are too many herbs in it that you can't distinguish any individual flavor plus it makes you really thirsty. Service is average. Cute retro diner decor. Haven't tried the shakes because they're $4+ which makes them seem expensive in comparison. Burger and fries for under $4? Count me in."}
{"text":"Super slow is an understatement.  It took over an hour to get what amounts to a fast food burger at this steak and shake location.  And then it wasn't even good.    I had the Western BBQ and Bacon burger...which I've had before via the drive thru at another location.  This location's version included two dried out patties with a half slice of cheese in between.  A tiny dollop of bbq sauce, single slice of bacon, and teaspoon of onion straws topped it off.  The Parmesan and herb seasoned fries tasted like neither Parmesan or herbs.    The only redeeming factor was the salted caramel pretzel shake and they even managed to mess that up.  I ordered a kids size because I know I shouldn't have that much dairy.  She served me a full size, apologized for the error, and charged me for full size."}
{"text":"I had been awaiting the opening of this place which seemed to have taken forever to arrive. The prices and product are better than I had anticipated. You can get a burger and fries for under $5 and shakes are reasonable as well.   The service wasn't below average. We sat down after an hour long wait to get in and I immediately order a Mint Cookie Shake. When our waiter came back to take our order I decide on a cheeseburger meal and I asked if they have cheddar cheese and he said no. Then while my guest was ordering I saw a freakin cheddar burger on the menu he did not mention to tell me about. I then change my order to that with all the same toppings. When the food came I still did not have my shake. He comes back with it and it was good, but runny from being ready for awhile. My burger was so good. Probably a new favorite burger place of mine actually! My waiter jacked up my toppings, but I didn't say anything. It was so darn tasty it didn't matter really. I also loved the fries. Thin and crispy. I sampled the Chicago dog and thought it was perfection.   All and all I will definitely be back regardless of the long wait or the service. The food is just that good!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this particular Steak & Shake several times over the past 10+ years...mediocre service was the norm. The past 2 times I have gone through the drive through, I have received the most accurate and friendly service! The gentle mans name is Michael and he is awesome! He is quick and efficient and super friendly! Steak & Shake, you should hire Michael to do your training!"}
{"text":"S'mores shake is good and mushroom burger.  Always a long line for the restaurant and the take-out.  Fries are only good when hot and service is always good.  Located in the casino and all the way in the back so find parking nearby or talk a long walk cause it's good for you.  The smell of the burgers is hard to get off your hands even after you wash them it has a strong after-smell that's not too pleasant."}
{"text":"As a person from the Midwest I've really missed the steak n shake taste.  The steakburger thing is really really tasty. It's a Midwestern thing.  There's another restaurant chain called Freddys it does really well.  But steak and shake really takes me back to the old days. The great.... The burgers.  A tastegasm.  These are amazing.  The not great... The music is a bit loud. Also they do the fries different in three 'signature' restaurants.  They are not close to the Midwestern taste.  The manager explained it to me.  Props to him for taking the time.  The poor... The location.  Downtown Tempe is a nightmare for the working adults with jobs who have cars. This may be a great location for bike, but it's not good for car driving working adults. Overall... Great burgers"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! It's even better when you don't have to pay for the food!! Ordered the Royale steak burger with chili n cheese fries and my mom had the guacamole steak burger with chili n cheese fries. For dessert mint Oreo cookies n cream shake. Service was bad, but I think it's because a lot of people came in at the same time, but that is no excuse for taking 20 minutes to serve us our drinks. In fact, the burgers came out before our drinks!!!   On to my Royale. When I took the lid off, it looked like a crippled piece of midget bacon gave birth to another crippled piece of midget bacon. I don't mean to offend crippled or little people, but it's just looked like someone broke off 2 pieces of bacon from a normal strip of bacon n put it in my burger.   Naturally I complained (I love bacon) and the server brought me a heaping helping of bacon on the side. That more than made up for it. My moms guacamole steak burger miraculously turned into a guacamole double bacon steak burger. Hahaha. My mom said her burger was good. I thought my burger was good, but I could tell it was sitting there for a while. The egg n patties in my burger was cold. But it still tasted delicious. Probably because it's the first meal I had all day and I just got done working out.   The chili cheese fries were ok. The chili isn't that great but I love the melted cheese sauce.   On to dessert. As I am writing this review, I am consuming my delicious mint Oreo shake. Good ending to my meal. If the meal was not comped and I had to pay for it, I'd probably give 3 stars.   All in all, filling n tasty. Yay my first review is done!!!!"}
{"text":"is it possible to send a delicious steak burger and shoe string fries to California?!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican waitstaff, very attentive,very polite, hold the fries, hard and frozen always Luke-warm & generic. Nicest employees everyone trained-well, and excellent customer service... Never a complaint..prices have jumped over the past year though. Hot dog is real drab and not worth $5.00."}
{"text":"1 of the best burger joints I've been to.  The burgers were very flavorable and juicy.  I need to do some research and see if they have other locations.   We got seated right away, the wait time was not to long and our waiter was awesome.  Answered our questions about the burgers and didn't seem to mind when we kept changing our mind on the drink orders."}
{"text":"They failed to tell us that when you get a single patty for the guacamole burger all you get is a patty, cheese, guacamole, and a bun....no vegetables or sauce that's it. The wait time was pretty long for how dead it was too but other than that the food was decent"}
{"text":"It was my first time with Steak 'n Shake. We enjoyed our lunch there and it was interesting concept. We will visit again."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. Love their food. I got the new sriracha burger & salt & vinegar fries with the cookie dough shake. Their service is nice & atmosphere is always chill. Even though, the employees always look down, they always come around to check on their customers & always have a smile when serving or talking to them. Only problem I have is that it's a far drive, I live in the north side of town. Nonetheless, great food & service!"}
{"text":"I've tried Steak n Shake once before but it was take out. I dreaded coming here again because I was not a fan of their burgers and couldn't figure out why the place had the word \"Steak\" in it when the burger seemed like any other burger. I was pleasantly surprised to see not only their prices, but when their food is fresh, it's actually very enjoyable. I had the Wisconsin Buttery which I feared was going to be too greasy which it was, but overall very tasty. The fries are good too as long as your sprinkle the seasoning on them. Overall enjoyable but I wouldn't say my favorite by any stretch. Still not sure why this place is always as busy as it is."}
{"text":"I have been to many Steak n Shakes around the country.  1. They are all slow (as compared to fast food).    I would consider them along side other fast casual places.  2.  They are more expensive than fast food.  While we are getting the same items - Cheeseburgers and milk shakes, they are made to order fresh.  3.  Food is good.  I have never had a bad meal.     I went thru the drive thru and ordered a Double Bacon Cheeseburger, small fries, and a Cinnamon Toast Crunch Milk Shake.  The wait was long - I had to pull up and wait with 3 other cars.   Each order (I was third in line) came out about 5 mins later.  I waited 15 minutes.       My food was hot (thus made fresh), my milk shake was cold.  Burgers are thin (thus the double).   They sear was great (I like a thinner burger with more surface area vs a thicker burger when cooked correctly).   The fries are really thin - reminds me of potato sticks I had as a kid.  The best fries.  There milk shakes are always on point and take the longest to make.   They do not have a \"shake\" machine.  I believe they are all hand made.  Their new cereal flavors are really cool.   I had something similar in NYC.   The Cinnamon Toast Crunch is (I believe) a Vanilla Milk Shake with some cereal blended in for flavor and then added on top.     It tastes as you would image.  Summary:  1. Wait was long (I was in my car) and was not warned.   It did not bother me as it did for others that were more sensitive on time. 2. Food quality was great / expensive.   My meal was over $10. 3. New Milkshake flavors get a high mark in my opinion.  A list of their flavors - https://orderonline.steaknshake.com/o/restaurant/18394/group/32826   3 stars due to the wait :-("}
{"text":"Back in the 60's and early 70's this was \"the\" place to cruise when I lived in Champaign after reading the reviews It looks like the place has gone to crap.I used to love the chili 3 way and a steak burger,I stopped in at the Steak N shake in Memphis,Tn on the way to visit wife's relations it also sucked, flavor was mediocre and the portions undersized for the price and the car hops are gone.I was wanting to stop in when my 50th class reunion comes up next year in my '54 Ford just like old times,guess I'll stay in Phoenix and go to Culvers or Freddies."}
{"text":"It wasn't super busy and the food was pretty good, as always! As well as their shakes! They're the best. The food came out super fast and the customer service was pretty attentive and making sure everything was good. They only have this location open at Southpoint and one on UNLV campus. I can't wait until they open more locations in Las Vegas! It's a good pit stop to get burgers and shakes! (Kinda like In-n-Out Burger) hahaha"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Steak n Shakes I have been to. The service was quick and our server Anthony was both hilarious and fun. The food tasted like other chain locations so the service really set it apart. Will definitely be back! Thanks Anthony!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! This location is in the Southpoint hotel casino so it gets busy.  I sat at the counter and I got the Frisco and it was really good.  I also got a chocolate banana shake and it was amazing.  I will be back for sure.  YUM!"}
{"text":"My trip to Indianapolis summer had me frequenting Steak 'n Shake while visiting.  The burgers are awesome and the shakes are even better.    I'm glad I only had to wait 6 months for this one to open.  Since my in-laws are from back East, all I heard every day was \"xx days until opening!\"  Now that I can compare this establishment to the ones back East, I must say the got it close.  Some things are off, but forgivable:  - The employees don't know the menu very well, they don't even know the 'hidden' menu!  My in-law tried ordering something (he worked there when he was a teenager) and they didn't know.  - The food is almost there.  My wife pointed out that somethings were missing or completely off.  - The service and wait was very slow.  Being the only one in town, we have no choice but to wait.  Hopefully it speeds up as the employees pick up.    One other nit-pick of mine is that while there is a huge line to get in, they are seating 2 people where you should seat 4 and then the party of 4 has to wait an extra 15-20 minutes.    My mandatory selections are: The double 'n cheese burger, The Frisco Melt, The FRIES! and the Shakes.  Don't be afraid to try the seasoning either. It was so good, I bought some to take home with me."}
{"text":"Let's see if they improve during my meal. Being open 24 Hours doesn't mean the want your business. Came in at 8.  Seat and then nothing. 10 minutes now. I have to update before I leave the parking lot. My waiter turned out to  be a doppelganger of Urkel. Country Skillet was good. The service sucks. One mgr sleeping on a table near the back. The cashier who rang me up was talking under her breath how no one else was going to ring me up. WTF   And I remember why I hadn't been back in more then 8 years"}
{"text":"Good food bad service. Never brought us our bill our waitress was mia and every other one ignored us. We went to register where we were ignored for another ten minutes. Seen a lot of employees coming in from outside and they all continued to ignore us. We could have left without paying, nobody would have cared or noticed."}
{"text":"This place opened up in Vegas a couple of months ago, and it seemed as though there was a general excitement about it around town. Apparently, it's a popular chain back in the midwest, though I can't understand why it's so popular.  The line was SUPER long to get into the restaurant for sit-down, so I walked right up to the take-out counter, which was actually devoid of any customers.  I ordered a $4 meal, which included a bacon-burger with a side of fries. I also ordered a regular-sized chocolate shake.  I have to say, the hype really let me down. The chocolate shake was awesome, but really just as enjoyable as a Wendy's Frosty. The fries were pretty gross...very skinny and more akin to potato chips. The burgers were alright....very reminiscient of SmashBurger...but I honestly have to say that I'd rather just go get a cheaper, better-tasting burger at Wendy's, or spend a little more and go to Fatburger.   Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"Usually I'd give 4 stars for this place. My wife & Daughter LOVE this place. But the other day my Daughter fell and broke her arm. After we went and got her cast on we took her to Steak & Shake to make her feel better. What a disappointment. We stood and waited to be seated for almost 15 mins, then after we were seated the waitress took her sweet time coming to the table. We asked for a straw and were informed that they were currently out.. I guess it's too hard to run across the street and buy some. But who needs straws @ a Milkshake joint ? We had to ask for forks, napkins, and it took almost 15 mins for our drinks. I looked around and noticed that most other patrons seemed to be having the same experience. All this while the place was barely half full. The only reason I'm still giving 3 stars is because we usually have a good experience here. But we were very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"Amazing shakes! A wide variety of flavors with a bunch of different mix-ins and they're all delicious. I slurped my Oreo shake down in 5 mins flat. Didn't have a burger or fries but they seemed good to by the looks of it."}
{"text":"This was the slowest Steak n' Shake I have ever been to! I waited in the drive-thru line for about twenty five minutes when there were only two cars in front of me. I would have just went inside but I had felt I had already committed and would probably have waited just as long inside.  Once I got to the window the girl did not apologize for the wait or even say hi. Just told me the total and then handed me the bag not even a good bye. I'm not expecting insane service at Steak 'n Shake but an hello and good bye would be nice.  I will say the fries were gold and soggy but that burger with the egg and bacon on top was so good for a fast food burger!"}
{"text":"Ordered double steak burgers with cheese at the drive through. Took them home and discovered greasy buns with meat inside, maybe there was some cheese holding them together but there was nothing else in there! Called and spoke to the \"manager\", a very condescending young twerp, who informed me they always come plain unless You request toppings??? I've not had that experience going to a Steak n Shake before. I won't be going back for my \"free\" replacements especially since I would have to talk to that rude manager kid again. Terrible customer care and yucky food."}
{"text":"Great place great food when it's not busy!  The shakes are a deal and they are delicious and can be a great deal for family dinners---when they are not busy.   The last four times I have been here they have been very busy and they are slow to get food out!  We arrived one night and sat next to a couple who said they had been there 45 minutes and had not ordered yet. We left! The drive through typically takes a half an hour to get through at dinner time so your better off calling ahead and picking it up. There shoestring fries can be bland."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who just got back from bootcamp/OCS in Georgia said that people there were raving about steak n' shake. Before heading out from vegas, we decided to stop by and try it out. I was extremely disappointed with the food. First off, the food portions were pitiful. I was able to down 2 triple steak burgers and not be satisfied. The patties fell apart and didn't taste all that great. The fries were definitely too salty. The only reason I am even giving this place 2 stars is because it doesn't cost an arm and a leg like the rest of the food in Las Vegas. If you want cheap shitty food while in vegas, this is your place. If I saw another steak n' shake anywhere else, I wouldn't even consider ever eating there."}
{"text":"Good food, great pricing. We ate here several times during our last two stays at South Point. The only downside is that you can't order online or by phone so you have to wait in line for 20+ minutes just to order if you're taking it to go. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved the chicken taco salad, as their specialty is their (delicious) burgers."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place takes this long to serve ppl. I didn't feel like dining in so I asked my bf to order to go. I seriously kid you not but it seriously took him over 40 mins. Poor guy. Maybe we should of dined in instead to save him of all this trouble.   He said that the place is pretty unorganized and poorly under staffed. There was only 1 person taking orders for the take out window. And the server wasn't there all the time.  The sever will check on the previous orders or will be helping around the restaurant! The place just looked pretty chaotic and ppl around are getting impatient but yet they all don't have a choice. There wasn't a food court in South Point! So there was only 2-3 places that allow take outs.   We ordered the original double stacked cheeseburger for $3.99 and a harvest Apple grill chicken salad $11.99. The food was worth the wait. But still not worth a 40 min wait.  The burger was out of this world!! It had a lot of flavor and very juicy but yet not too oily.  I would come back again just to dine in next time. The salad was just as good to but on a healthier note. The grill chicken was Nicky seasoned and grilled so that it was not dry. They served a reasonable size chicken over the salad. The rest of the salad was garnished with slicers apples, dry cranberries, and pine nuts. It felt like I was haven't a trail mix in a salad. I really enjoy the nice blend and I know I wouldn't be able to order this salad anywhere else. But a great idea on what to put in your salad at home.   Next time I would dine in instead of ordering to go. Might as well enjoy a quiet bonding time since the kitchen and staff are slow. I'll even order a shake next time to keep me company.."}
{"text":"omfg i  will never ever order a fucking grilled cheese ever again here they have no fucking idea how to dam melt my fucking cheese at all this is the worst fucking place ever omg screw yall fuckers"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure I get the hype.  There are tons of burger joints in Las Vegas that are a) much better, and b) won't have you waiting for an hour.  Yes, the burgers are good. Yes, the burgers are cheap. No, they didn't taste like steak. It tasted like a regular old burger, and it reminded me a lot of Cheeburger Cheeburger, which I almost prefer.  If you're in South Point, this is probably - by far - the best place to eat. Otherwise, I don't think I'd even give it another look. For me, it was the same as Fatburger, Cheeburger Cheeburger... really nothing special here. Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is amazing! The food was fresh and delicious. The employees were super friendly and the service was fast. I love the easy access from St. Rose Parkway and this location even has a drive-through which is great when I don't want to get the little ones out of the car:) A+++"}
{"text":"Do not order breakfast or any food for that matter from this restaurant unless you want to get rock hard biscuits and cold sandwiches - person taking the order showed attitude food has gone downhill sadly"}
{"text":"Maybe they are still working out the kinks ... but our first experience was not so good at this location. We ordered to go - by the time we got our milkshakes food was cold, fries were soggy. The service was sooooooo slow."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. There was no wait when I went,  sat right down and ordered. Had the bacon burger and my wife ordered the portobello mushrooms burger. The service was good, they got the drinks and appetizers right away! I ordered chili and it was beyond amazing! Honestly will be going back to just have the chili! The burgers were ok, not really what I expected, wish the meat patty was thicker. For dessert I had a strawberry milkshake that almost put me right to sleep lol. Overall  my favorite thing was the chili and dessert!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth attempt at going to this place. It's Father's Day and I hear they had breakfast so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Ive tried it before. The food and service was absolutely horrible.   Nothing has changed.   Walked in the door. The sign says wait to be seated as always. The place is busy but there are open tables. The hostess is working the cash register with people paying their bills. The remaining wait staff is behind a prep area.  No one says anything to us. After 2-3 minutes the hostess walks away and goes to the prep area and proceeds to start texting on her phone.   She finally seats us. She goes back the the pay area texting whiles she's walking to the register. People seated are getting their own menus because no one is coming to their table. . After sitting for 10 minutes unacknowledged we left.   Consistently bad. Year after year. Don't waste your time going here. Stupid me gave them too many chances."}
{"text":"The kids LOVE this place. They seem to be always understaffed though. Takes too long to be sat, served, get your food, AND pay your bill. The really need to hire some people."}
{"text":"My family arrived for late night meal. Two employees were smoking directly outside the door, so I went in the other door. As I was waiting to be seated, the young lady walked in and began seating me. The guy walked over to the grill and began handling the food without washing his hands.  We spoke to the manager and let them know what happened before we left. The cook was still handling food without washing his hands. My family left, and we won't be back.  I don't understand how they can have absolutely no people in the establishment and have so many dirty tables with  dirty dishes that haven't been cleared. Or how they don't practice basic handwashing techniques before touching food. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"So the feeling that you get when you enter a Steak 'n Shake is an old school 50s kind of diner. If you have been to a Johnny Rockets, it has the same kind of feel to it. It isn't something I'm particularly use to since I don't go to places like that often. I don't know the variety of foods that they served in those old school diners, but I would expect a wide range of foods, but here, it's pretty much burgers and sandwiches.  When I went with my party, our party was too big to sit on one table and the larger table they had was taken up and so they had to break us up into two booths which were adjacent, which wasn't bad, but not ideal for social interaction. When we sat down, it took a while before our server came with our waters and a while before we got our orders taken, which was just a bit annoying. After we ordered, the second table that we had ordered the same time as my table, and somehow got their food and milkshakes around 10 minutes before our table, which is quite baffling to me. When our food came, it was pretty much what we ordered which composed of some burgers and sandwiches. Our server didn't come by very often to fill up our water or come by to check up on us, which would be nice to do at least once throughout our meal and not just at the very end, but it's alright, at least we didn't ask for anything major.  The food selection here is nothing too special. This isn't the type of Denny's style diner where they have a wide array of food to choose from, just some burgers, sandwiches, chili, milkshakes, and I can't remember anything else really. This isn't my type of food to eat very often, but my friends wanted to pay this place a visit and they do have a decently cheap menu, which was a bonus. If you wish to pay this place a visit, I would say just go, but don't expect anything too special."}
{"text":"I think just about everyone in town loves the Steak 'N Shake at the South Point. This place has the same name, but the feeling is different here. It is not sit down style. It is a typical burger chain, except the menu is smaller.   The service was good, my burger and fries did take a while, but both were very hot and tasty. But, the one item I love the most at Steak 'N Shake is the Chili Mac and it is not offered. That is very disappointing and  a big reason why I will probably only visit the one at the South Point.   The location is bizarre. I am not sure why they chose a building where the front does not face a heavily crowded road with easier access.   Why they did not just replicate the Steak 'N Shake experience at the South Point is beyond me. I think the \"shell of a true Steak 'N Shake\" and the location are huge mistakes which will be very costly to the investors. I hope they reconsider and make it better and I would gladly return."}
{"text":"Just awful and bad service. I ordered my meal with a friend and he got a shake that had butterfinger and cookie down in it. He let me try it and it was really good so after my meal I went back and ordered that same shake for myself and it was $3.55 for the small which is the same one as he got. It is around 7:40 and we are the only ones in the store, so after 20-25 min of waiting my friend and I go up to ask and the man says \"Oh I looked over there (by the register) and couldn't find you\". I hold up my buzzer that they gave me and said \"well you could've buzzed me or just saw us over there we are the only ones here\". So he brought out my partially melted and small shake and said \"don't worry about it man\". This wasn't him refunding me it was implying blame on me. I argued the size of my shake because my friend got a bigger one and he ordered small too. They said no and I was left with my gross melted small shake for $3.55 and I was in a rush so I didn't want to deal with this. Very disappointing because I use to go there a lot but I'll just go to a different burger place on Mill now"}
{"text":"Food is average, nothing special. The shakes are always good and large. Cheap prices too. Service is okay, kinda slow. The workers don't ever look happy to be there"}
{"text":"Went at two am with friends. Terrible service and overcooked food. Our waiter was distracted by the nearly naked girls a few tables over, especially the one who decided to drop it like it was hot in steak n shake. Apparently \"it\" was hot, my food was not. Go to iHop and avoid the hoodlums."}
{"text":"Five stars for the Wisconsin butter burger. Except i get it with pickles instead of the onions and it is sooo good. The thin cut crispy fries are also amazing.   Today i tried the bacon cheddar burger with only pickles on it anddd its pretty darn good. Not as good as the butter burger though....Im going to stick with that one from here on out."}
{"text":"Don't waste time downloading their app and uploading gift cards or funds to it.  The stores and the app don't work so your funds can't be used to pay your bill.   Way to go Steak and Shake.   Maybe figure out what your doing before you push an app full of flaws."}
{"text":"As another reviewer has noted, this place is nowhere near Ridge Rd. It's on the road that runs behind the Giant Eagle. I lived here a year before I even noticed it.  Food was just ok. Nothing special about it, and come to think of it, there never has been at any Steak 'n Shake. I am a fan of their thin fries though. Especially with the seasoned salt that they have at the table (don't fall for the marketing, it is plain old seasoned salt). Why would I pay extra for their \"special\" add-on seasonings either? Had a double bacon cheese steakburger with all the toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo). Bacon had absolutely no flavor. It was crunchy, but that's it.  Service was great! Attentive, knew the menu, and friendly.  Cleanliness however, was an issue. Not dirty, but needing attention as the ledges were dusty, the glass smudged, and floors could use a spot mop."}
{"text":"We love taking our kids here! The prices are great and the shakes are OUTSTANDING!!! Wish we had one closer to the west side, but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"This was a total disappointment, other than the prices. The food was just OK at best and the shakes were terrible (not real ice cream). This is basically the same thing as going to McDonald's, and I would have to say that the McDonald's fries are better. It's just another lame tourist trap restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday. My husband ate here all the time in Illinois and kept saying how wonderful it was so I was excited to try it. The waiter took our order and then we never saw him again. Another waiter brought our drinks but did not bring my kids shakes. Several minutes later the shakes came and I must say these were the worst vanilla shakes I've ever tasted. Something was wrong! Then I notice my glass is not only dirty, but sticky. At this point I'm trying to find our waiter but he never comes near us. So we finally get another guy's attention and when I explain the nasty shakes and dirty glass to him he asks, \" do you want to change them?\"  Duh!! Of course we do. He brings me a new soda in a clean glass and says the shakes are coming. Then the food comes. The fries tasted like they had been under a warmer forever and my sandwich was wrong. I didn't special order it, they just forgot how to make it I guess. Still no shakes. Someone tells me they are working on it. We talk to the manager who tells me they only have one person who can make shakes....seriously?! She tells me there will be no charge so I told her to forget the shakes and left.  Horrible experience. I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"My family of 7 just left this one at Concord Mills and I was very pleased with the service and attention to detail.  Elena was so very sweet and patient with our 5 kids as we ordered during a busy Sunday afternoon.  She helped us get more bang for our buck as it is Kids Eat Free Weekend.  Food is always delicious.  After the meal, we started leaving the restaurant and realized I left my baby's sippy cup.  My oldest ran back in.  Of course, then I realized I left my boxed meal that had mine and the baby's meal.  Ran back in and their clean up staff is quick!  The table was cleared and my take home box gone.  Without a second thought Elena asked for my burger and the baby's corn dogs to be made again.  I couldn't believe it, it was my fault for leaving the food behind but, she didn't want me to go home without my meal.  It's service like this that makes me want to come again.  She could have easily said \"too bad, so sad\" and been in the right but, she went above and beyond.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't want to even give them one star but I had to pick something or i wasn't able to post. The website says open till 1am and I'm here at 11:50 pm and the staff was walking out and told me it was closed? Either update your website or get a new staff! Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. I try to eat relatively healthy and this was well . . . not. But I was surprised by the great prices. Shakes were very good."}
{"text":"Second worse food I've eaten in AZ since moving here 11 years ago. This place has nothing in common with the sit down Steak and Shakes back east. Really limited menu, walk up ordering like any other fast food place. The fries were not those golden, crispy shoestring ones that everyone loves. Dark, soggy and inedible. I ate half of the burger before throwing it all in the trash. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Our food was delivered fast. Prices were bomb. Our food with desert under 25.00 for 3 people. Our waitress was very attentive. We will be coming back, food is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucked beginning to end. Long wait at the door, ok. Solid 10 minutes before our order is taken, and, wait for it... 45 minutes for some burgers and fries. Double cheeseburger and chipotle burger were both totally overbooked and dried out. A tiny drop of chipotle sauce lurking under the lettuce was barely noticeable on the dry bun.  This might have easily been the crappiest  burger I have ever eaten. Avoid the place like the plague !"}
{"text":"Steak N Shake is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm tour in the South, so when I find out one was coming to Vegas, I was absolutely thrilled. I decided to wait a few days til the opening crowds had died down, but when my friend and I arrived at 10pm last night the place was still very busy.   My friend had the Steak Frank and fries while I ordered a mint cookies n cream milkshake. David loved the dog, said it was one of the best he'd ever had. The minute they set it down just the smell of it told you it was a REAL all-beef dog.   My shake took a while to come out (like I said, the place was busy) but when it arrived it didn't disappoint. Perfectly mixed (not runny but not so thick you have to wait to drink it).   Everything on the menu is reasonably priced (4 bucks for a HUGE triple burger and fries, \"shooters\" for 89 cents apiece) You will spend a little LESS than you would spend eating at McDonald's and get food that is 100x as good. Not to mention, during the week they have a Happy Hour from 2-4pm where shakes are half price.  My one and only complaint is that the location isnt 24 hours. Im hoping that this will be changed soon because I know for a fact they would be slammed at any hour of the day now that the word is out.  So glad to have SnS in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Waitress needs improvement, waitress  made four trips to take our order and still forgot what we ordered overall the food was good. A lot of employees doing nothing"}
{"text":"Nice spot at the Southpoint for some cheap comfort food whenever you are craving a burger and fries and even a hot cup/bowl of chili.  Their milkshakes are also great too!  Prices are decent especially $4 menu.  Usually end up here every time after bowling or seeing a film at the cinemas.  I love how there is flavored seasoning and hot pepper sauce at table to add a kick and that you can get different seasonings for fries instead of having them plain.  Only downside is they usually have long lines at peak times like dinner, but there is a take out window to order to go."}
{"text":"The prices are great for the amount of food you get and love the happy hour.  Food was good and hot.  Sodas and milkshakes were good, too.  I would suggest more wait staff and,  please,  clean the area I  front of the store.   Trash can was turned over and cigarette butts were everywhere."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Steak n Shake I've ever been to. Place was filthy, beyond short staffed, terrible service, food was awful."}
{"text":"Worst Steak N Shake ever. It wasn't extremely busy but it took a few minutes to get seated. Food was ok but very messy and seemed rush. Our shake sat out for a while and was runny and warm. The water was colder than it and the freezer burnt berries didn't help either."}
{"text":"Not you average experience.   Come and plan to wait long times at the table.    Enjoy the views and wait long times to place drink orders.   Enjoy seeing wait staff walk around without taking your order.   Plan to spend an hour just to place and order once seated."}
{"text":"Update!! Now that I've been here 4 times, I can write a better review. This place seriously lacks consistency. The first time was delicious! Let me say, DO NOT come here on a weekend, holiday, or any other busy time. Fries are cold, burgers are slapped together with dry patties. At least they get the milkshake every time. Also, they do not accept the Steak n Shake app here. Bummer!!"}
{"text":"Located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino. Been wanting to try this restaurant out. I had the Frisco Melt with Parmesan Cheese and Herbs fries. You pay $0.50 extra for the seasoned fries. The food and service was good and it didn't break the bank. The double chocolate fudge shake was not as I expected. I figured it would have a more chocolaty taste. I was a bit disappointed.   If they come to San Diego I would go to the restaurant. I want to try the Cincinnati style chili next time."}
{"text":"Train wreck..... It only gets worse the longer you are in the place.  There is a lack of management, employees do not know their job, and a big let down.  There are currently hiring so if you want to get paid up too 10 bucks an hour for doing a shitty job go for it."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment twice now.  Enjoyed it both times.  Burgers, salads, and shakes are excellent.  Wish there was one of these in San Diego.  You may need to wait for a table (we waited about 30 minutes), but it was worth the wait.  Service was top-notch, friendly and spot-on with our order.  If you are in the area, must visit, great for kids."}
{"text":"I don't know I guess it's me who really likes S&S. I love the Wisconsin buttery double party burger. Yes I do. But today the fries was not all that good. But the burger was. Which I had to add some lettuce and tomato and a little mayo. Then it was MY  perfect S&S  burger. Ha ha ha   The hubby order the 5 way which was a little spicy for my daughter but good for him.  His burger was the $4.00 triple burger no cheese.  How can you beat that $4.00. Annnnnd it comes with fries. Check the seperate menu. The little girl got the mini burgers kids meal. I did ask Jet our waiter to put mayo, ketchup and lettuce but it came plan with nothing but cheese. Boring!! I had to add mayo it seemed dry.  My niece ordered the chili spaghetti with cheese and onions. Eeeeeeh it's ok.  My nephew ordered the Royale it was alright. So our burger day was good other than the taking forever for the check or actually getting someone to get our check. But it's busy what can you say BUT hire more people.   If you don't want to wait you can also order for take out.  They have a whole section for take out."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service sucked. It took 20 min to get someone to even get our drink order. 10 min to get refills. Our server was Julio."}
{"text":"Wow, did I just pay less than $20 for myself and two hungry teens for lunch on Mill Ave.? YES!! In fact, it was $16 and some change for two burgers, chicken fingers and 3 fries. (We all wanted water to drink, which helps) Almost noon and it wasn't busy at all. Indoor and outdoor seating. Great service, nice clean place, and yummy food. I'd hit this again fo sho!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after chilling at the pool all day. We were starving and this def hit the spot! If you're looking for a classy burger joint, this isn't it... But if you're looking to stuff your face and not care how unattractive you look doing it.. I suggest you go here. I got the western bacon burger and I would have taken a picture but I was so hungry I forgot. The milkshakes were on point and huge. You totally get your money's worth. Their prices are about the same as Wendy's."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst service I ever have had in my life this was horrible gettin seated took forever getting served I saw my waitress twice when she asked for orders and gave us our food and basically tried to say get out by giving us our check with the food that's not very welcoming also it took about 20 min just to give them our money it was the most ridiculous experience of my life if there is a run down rat hole I advise to eat there first"}
{"text":"I don't see what the fuss is about and don't understand why there is a constant line outside. I waited a few weeks after opening hoping the line would die down and it never did. Figuring there must be something great about this place, the boyfriend and I stuck with the 25 minute wait. The burgers are nothing great. I honestly don't even think they give Mickey D's a run for their money. The fries had no flavor at all. The only thing worth it at this place were the shakes. The mint oreo shake was pretty yummy. I will save the few extra bucks and the wait time and stick to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"The worst. Service is awful and food is the same. It felt like we were bothering the 10+ employees who were standing around eating and talking ignoring customers. We have a 5 year old who got an adult menu. We asked for a kids menu and he is used to the the car kit and crayons. None of this was provided. We didn't get napkins or silverware and the food order was wrong. If I could give less than zero stars, I would.  Shut it down."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant,  this place is one of the best. The prices are very reasonable, and the quality of the burger is on par with Culver's. The staff are very energetic and friendly. If you drink soda, they have a vast selection, and I do enjoy their shoestring fries. I'm very pleased to see this place here in Arizona.  Edit: The staff USED to be friendly. I see they've downsized quite a bit since my last visit. This time, I asked for a larger water cup because I can't drink soda anymore, to which the manager on duty told me \"no\", because those cups cost a little more. This was right after I'd just paid for my food. And so, my 5 star review is now a 3 star. Ah well. Will I be returning? That remains to be seen.  Edit 2 (last visit): So I returned, unfortunately. Smaller portions on the fries, and I waited over 30 minutes and there were maybe two other customers in the place. I'm done with this Steak N Shake. Makes me sad, but I have to let you go."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. Not only should you plan to spend half a tank of gas waiting in line, plan to spend not only your lunch break waiting for food, best start to place your order at 8am, you may get it by dinner... Yes I'm exaggerating but seriously wait times are the worst I've ever sat through, they do not serve food fast. Other than the outrageously long wait times the other reason for my rarely given one star review is poor service... While being handed my Coke Zero at the drive thru window the cashier while passing the styrofoam cup along with my debit card using one single hand at one time...my debit card punctured thru the cup spraying pop all over my car, me, and her...you get the picture... She offered no apology, pulled the cup back in, then handed me my card, and offered no apology or replacement drink let alone napkins to clean up the coke she had just sprayed all over me, my work clothes, and car...I had to ask for napkins and a replacement drink sadly. Service is poor at best at this location for sure."}
{"text":"This review is for this Steak 'n Shake location only.  We were excited when we finally had a SNS open in Arizona.  I didn't want to leave a negative review so didn't leave a review at all when we found out this location had a limited menu, loud annoying music and the parking is awful.  The food had been good and hey, it was a SNS in Arizona which we have wanted for years as everyone loves SNS.  Well the past three times we have been in were awful.  Last time the service was bad, the place was dirty and they messed up our order.  We went in yesterday and once again they messed up our order, we didn't get our shakes until we were done eating - they no longer have any of the shakes I like and the french fries were so covered in salt that I couldn't eat them and had to throw them away.  When this location first opened we were here every week (driving 30 minutes or so to get here) and the staff was good.  Now everyone is new, not many employees have been staying and our orders are wrong.  So sad to leave a negative review for SNS!  If you are ever in another state though you need to try them out as every other location is great!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty bomb sandwiches and burgers, its like classic style dinning. Pros.... the food is super good and the shakes are mouth watering. The staff is pretty cool and very attentive. I just think it needs a bit more variety but their prices for food is right on. Non expensive which is a plus. Okay the cons... its very small and very tight. Theres always wait time because of its small capacity. And its also at the very corner of the casino floor and right next to the escalator so theres always lots of traffic and people stamding around."}
{"text":"review is WAY OVER DUE!...  RETRO THEME! loved it. how about lets end our vegas trip with burgers and milkshakes?   before hitting the road back to LA, the roomies and I wanted to get lunch and we came across steak n shake. when we arrived the place was packed so we waited in line outside.  we waited for awhile before getting seated, so you can only imagine how hungry we had gotten by then.    i order the spicy chipotle burger which was yummy. not to dry and full of flavors.  pricing of a fast food joint but ambiance of the 50s :)"}
{"text":"So the first time I had Steak N Shake was when my friend bought it for me while I was at home watching movies. So I have not experienced the service personally. But when I first saw my burger (the Jalapeno one), it wasn't very good-looking. I took one bite, hm, okay. I took another, actually biting into the meat and everything this time, and it was like a party in my mouth! It was delicious! I finished my burger before my friend, and I wanted another one! (Unfortunately my friend had only bought me one burger :[ ) So, 5 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"This place is a cluster.  Grill needs cleaning everything tastes burnt. Very dirty overall . 4 complaints about wrong orders in the 10 minutes I was there waiting.  Very disorganized"}
{"text":"I love steak n shake, I've been to many chains and had positive experience. However, this was the worst dining experience. We had to seat ourselves and move tables around so our party can sit together. Another waitress had to explain to us that our waitress would be coming out to get our order. Our food and drinks did not come at the same time. The waitress was not attentive when we were ordering and had to say our order multiple times. The staff looks miserable too. Just a bad experience all together."}
{"text":"My friend, an Indiana native introduced me to this place as it's based in Indiana. This is apparently the only location on the west coast... yay Vegas! It's located inside South Point... kind of far from the strip. You can either take Las Vegas Blvd all the way down or hop on the I-15S and get off at Silverton if you are on the way back to LA or just exit Silverton from I-15N if you are heading to Vegas.   My friend raved about this place, stating how much she missed it and that it was pretty  much all she missed about Indiana! She ordered 4 for the road... I just ordered one burger and one order of chicken strips for the drive home. I must say, prices are cheap!! The royale was about $5 and included fries. A royal comprised of a double patty, an egg, and bacon... and it was greasy goodness. The patties are charbroiled and have a crispy edge. I would say go for the double because a single is really thin and the meat to bun ratio will mean too much bun. The chicken strips and fries were $4 and it came with 3 strips and fries... I had 4 strips however, but I think it's because 2 were smaller. The fries are the thin shoestring one and they have seasoned fries too for an extra 29 cents. I opted for the salt and pepper and the garlic parmesan. I would go for the garlic parmesan again.   I don't know if I would go off the strip for them as I don't like to be off the strip when I'm in Vegas... however it is a good option when you're coming in/out of Vegas. It's very casual and diner style here. You can either eat in or go to the take out window to order.   I'm def a fan of this place and am glad my friend introduced me to something new and not native to California. My friend said the shakes are also really good. I read there there is happy hour where the drinks are half off! All single patty burger with fries are $4 and the specialty ones are different prices. I think the highest I saw was probably $6. Food here is very cheap. Try it! If you don't like it, at least it didn't cost a lot of money!"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good compared to In N Out burgers. They are soft and juicy. I recommend coming to try eating them at least once. Although their burgers are pretty good, I probably won't be coming here too often by myself. My friends love this place already and have eaten here several times this week. However, it is a little pricey for my taste.  I do have to say the burgers tasted fresh. If I rank In N Out first place on taste, I probably give SNS second place. haha.  Also... you can't buy the burger by itself. You get fries with it and that ups the cost. What if I don't want fries? And the burgers are fatty and greasy. I'm sticking with the protein style at In N Out. Less fat, less money. Equally tasty!"}
{"text":"Just had to walk out of this location because after my family and I sat for 20 minutes nobody waited on us or even acknowledged us.  Multiple people around us were waited on and received their drinks and appetizers.  Very disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the new Steak 'n Shake tonight. His friends raved about it so we decided to check it out. We were pretty disappointed. The burgers and fries taste like what you'd find at any other fast food restaurant but the other places are a lot cheaper. The milkshakes left a lot to be desired.  So we came, we tried, and we won't be back again."}
{"text":"Great value and tasty food.  Went during half-price milkshakes (2-5 PM?).  About 20 different milkshake flavors.  If you like onion rings, they only charge  $.59 to substitute onion rings for fries and you get 8-10 onion rings.  Service was fast considering we had a party of ten.   Would have even been better if location participated in Steak 'n Shake's reward program."}
{"text":"The burger was good, but I was hungry about an hour later. But the chili cheese fries and burger tasted great and price was reasonable"}
{"text":"The $4 burger with 3 by 3 burger is delicious and an amazing. The meat didn't taste like steak, just a normal hamburger. Still satisfies  just as much as a rubies or Johnny rockets."}
{"text":"The server was attentive and friendly. The food was meh. I foolishly ordered a portobello burger thinking it would be a giant mushroom cap on a bun. No just another steak burger with mushrooms. They politely made me a bun with cheese and sliced mushrooms. Oh well live and learn. The sea salt and pepper fries were way too salty to the point of almost being inedible, but after the above fiasco I ate them anyway. Service gets about 4 stars, food 3ish."}
{"text":"There's a few things going for this place.  Nice bright decor, a bar area to eat for about 4-6 people and a separate area/line for to-go orders only.  The place has a pretty long line waiting to get in just before opening and stays that way most of the night.  If you come for the milkshakes, there's a weekday happy hour from 2-4 PM where they are half off!  The bad: I liked their oreo milkshake but then I ordered a banana milkshake and was totally powder based.  I mean, come on, this place has the word \"shake\" in it.  You could at least use real fruit in your banana shake.  I can't believe I didn't complain or get it replaced.  The burgers are advertised to be steak patties.  What they should mention is that they are just flattened are a bit on the dry side.  I ordered mine with just veggies and some Frisco sauce expecting the meat to be juicy, but it was far from it.    Don't come expecting a great burger.  I'd prefer In-n-Out..or if you're from San Diego Hodad's or Rocky's would easily beat this burger in a cook-off.  The shakes were hit and miss...ask if they use real fruit, if not, stick to the other flavored or specialty shakes.  I guess the best things about this place are the atmosphere and low prices."}
{"text":"I had not visited a Steak & Shake since college (20+ years). When I realized there was one across the street from the MGM Grand I quickly made plans for.dinner. Food was great. Service was attentive but hampered by the lengthy  time between ordering and receiving our food (1 hour, 10 minutes) and then waiting for shakes (35 minutes from time ordered). Restaurant was only about a third full on a weekday evening. I know this location is having a soft opening and may not be fully up to speed (pun intended) but they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"We sat down and waited for five minutes only to be completely ignored. Only one other table was seated so they weren't busy. We finally walked out. We won't be back. If I could give it half a star I would."}
{"text":"For Goodness sakes: Stay away! I've currently been waiting for an hour, still no food. That's not even the worst part. No, the speed definitely is an issue but the LACK of customer service is by far the biggest complaint. 3 waitresses and a manager at the register. Not one of the 4 have smiled or spoken a word in a nice or friendly manner to a customer. Please. Please do not give these rude lazy people your money. So not worth it"}
{"text":"The service here is...okay. I've had better service at other Steak 'n Shake locations, the crew here seems more focused on themselves as opposed to the customers. Our waitress was very short with us and seemed rather impatient. But the food and shakes are good, as always."}
{"text":"It's a good place to come for cheap shakes and food. Once, their sign read \"All Men Under $4\""}
{"text":"I have ALWAYS LOVED Steak n Shake!! Being in the military seperates me from it quite often, but while visiting Las Vegas this weekend I remembered I could once again live my best life at my favorite restaraunt....and there it was; Perfectly nestled at the entrance of the Hooters Hotel, Steak N Shake greeted me with a warm hug. I got my favorite sandwhich and these delicious parmesean fries with a cocoa krispies shake and my life was complete!! Awesome service, flawlessly scrumptious food and our waitress Kristen was hospitable, sweet, and professional. Thank yall, especially you Kristen, cheers to all who visit tgis glorious establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Liam is the best waiter hands down. He was so nice to me and my table, and made our meal as well as experience so enjoyable! #GiveLiamARaise"}
{"text":"I am not usually one to leave reviews for fast food restaurants because most know what to expect. This one is on floor of SP almost out of the tourist area. It is not the high traffic area and because of that the place was pretty empty. We arrived and waited ten minutes to be seated despite 5 or 6 wait staff standing around chatting and many open tables. Once seated we waiting another 10 minutes for our order to be taken. 30 minutes passed and we still hadn't gotten our drinks, so we stopped the waiter and asked him. His reply was \"O yeah\" no apology or anything else. Ten minutes later he brought the drinks. So an hour after stepping in the door we had and ice tea and a water at the table. The food followed in another 15 minutes. 55 minutes for a burger and fries in a half empty restaurant? I tried to say something to the manager, who was working as a cashier, when I paid my bill. His attitude was this is a fast food joint, what do you expect? Do not stop here if you actually want fast (as in quickly) food, or good service go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Steak N Shake provides some interesting burger options and even some chicken tenders/sandwiches. One thing I'm not too fond of is their ridiculously skinny fries. They're ok but you need at least 3 fries at a time to equal 1 normal fry!"}
{"text":"I actually used to work as a server at a steak n shake. I havent had their food since then (6+ years)   One thing about this location... suppppppperrrrr slow.   I ordered take out and really didnt know what i wanted. I was heading to an early Easter dinner with my family, but since it was 4 hours away from dinnertime, stopped in for a snack. for some reason i ordered the chili cheese dog meal. It looked waaayy better on the picture. It took forever for my hot dog and fries to make (i used to work there.. i know their shoe string fries take 25 seconds to fry) Anyways after 20 minutes of waiting i opened up the bowl the hot dog was in and it was a hot mess. i honestly just ended up eating the hot dog itself then dipping the bun in the chili cheese mess inside the bowl -_-  Dont bother coming after 10pm for drive thru. I honestly think one person works drive thru and grill overnight. The wait time is so long.  butttttttttttttttttttt, gotta love that Frisco melt! :D"}
{"text":"..such an upsetting experience here. My family lives an hour away and came in town for dinner and Dave & Busters. We knew D&B's food was overpriced and always a long wait so we decided on here.   We were a party of 6 adults and 1 kid. Raquan was our server and he was so nice. He took our order but sadly we waited 45 minutes for it to com.Everyone around us who just ordered 15 minutes before already had their food. I've worked at steak n shake before. it less than 10 minutes to cook both the burgers and fries. I have no idea if kitchen lost our ticket or what but i did see our server talking to them more than once about our order so atleast he was on top of it.  The manager here needs better training. He stood at the register the entire time cashing people out even though clearly the kitchen was behind and customers in the dining area were angry (saw a couple leave after waiting for server and another table talk to manager about wait time). Again i've worked at another steak n shake. The counter girl is responsible for cashing people out and take out orders.. manager should helping on the grill or over-seeing everything going on. Poor Raquan had to keep coming over to apologize whenever the manager should have. Who tf trained the boss here?  Sadly after an hour at the restaurant and 45 minutes waiting on food, we told our server we had to leave. He told us dont worry about the drinks. We tipped him and went to eat at chikfila. At least the rest of the night was fun at D&B.   shoutout to Raquan . You're the real MVP"}
{"text":"There shakes are amazing for a low price and they have a lot of varieties of shakes to choose from."}
{"text":"I really really wanna like this place but there is just something that is off. The skinny Back story Before I decided to purchase vehicle I used to ride the light rail home mon-fri I would travel east on university exit mill ave and walk to light rail station. I one day saw the sign for a steak and shake I def got excited as I have heard of this chain from family and friends in Illinois and as a lover of shakes. They had a great prices a good size burger and fries for 4$ the burger is def a greasy bastard but what do u expect from a burger. Taste wise was ok no real distinct seasoning on it pretty bland but it was ok. The fries are great the first time they were pretty salty but they have since gotten better the only problem is they have a lot of crumbs and fries edges. The milkshake tastes like leaving ice cream with out a lid in freezer and it getting that freezer burn taste, everytime I go back I just skip the shake but I may give it another shot soon. Service is great and fast parking can and usually is a nightmare.  This place deserves more of a 2 1/2 stars instead of 3 but they are def not a 2 I have had worse burgers and for the price I'm not complaining I have gone back a few times pretty much cause they gave me and my girl a free burger on our birthday which she gave to me :-) score!! I will still go back cause I do love the cheese fries just hook up more fries please."}
{"text":"Poor management at Robinson location. Waitstaff are very nice...our food was good until we ordered milkshakes for dessert and it all went downhill--long story short--the older lady manager handled our situation VERY POORLY--we won't even be back to give them a second chance...I'd rather travel the distance to another one than to give this manager my business."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place....the service here is horrible. We waited over 30 minutes for a hamburger and fries. One of our drinks was served in a glass so dirty that it had to be returned and the drink tossed. It is pretty clear that Hooters mgmt has no idea what is going on in this place. Do not go here"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Steak and Shake in St. Louis when I lived there so I was excited that they were in Tempe.   The burger was excellent but you have to order a signature burger with fries whether you want them or not. Fries were greasy, burger was not over cooked and juicy. This is not the Steak and Shake I remember, it was like stopping at a fast food place. The shakes are still creamy and delicious.   I am a bit disappointed, did not have the full menu including the chili. I will try it again.  Parking here is a challenge, limited seating. I am surprised as this is a college town and the place was packed with lots of people waiting for seats."}
{"text":"Love the staff and food. I drive the 20min just for an awesome shake. My kids love the food and the husband love the burgers and shakes"}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be perfect! They have an more extensive menu than I remember from Florida. Maybe it's because we went through the drive thru in FL. The burgers are OK. Nothing amazing, but good. They have some cool french fries options that SOUND delicious, but dont taste delicious. It's unfortunate there is usually a HUGE line; both to be seated and to go."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great..but convenient like going to In and Out..I will have to try it again.."}
{"text":"Where's my guac?  Noodle boy is cute though  Wrong burger  No fries  But free cheese tho"}
{"text":"I have stopped here for a burger several times.  Service and food have always been great.    Today in Tempe they had the color run and all the open business are working extra hard.    After waiting 15 minutes for my order,  I think it got missed. One of the managers stated they were very sorry and she would bring my order right out to me..in about two minutes she w as at my table with a fresh and hot burger and fries.   Awesome!!!  A few minutes later she checked on me, then surprised we with a coupon for a couple free burgers on my next visit.  GREAT SERVICE,  GREAT PRICE, GREAT BURGERS, GREAT MANAGEMENT.  FIVE STAR LOCATION"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this, we didn't have it in Seattle! We ordered through the app, went to pick up. They gave us a very incomplete order at first, had to tell them we were still expecting more food, our shakes, etc. Get it home and still found a couple things missing. Burgers were honestly nothing special but we didn't know what to expect. Not much better than your run of the mill burger king fare, really. Like I said though, we didn't know what to expect. It was very cheap, $40 to feed 5. If you sign up on their app you can earn rewards... just signing up gets you a free milkshake or 2.99 off your total so that was cool. They have a breakfast menu that I'm curious to try!"}
{"text":"This was actually a quick trip, just wanted a classic strawberry shake, is that so much 2 ask....."}
{"text":"A long time ago I took my parents to eat at Steak 'n Shake.  A friend told me that they had good fries.  He left out the rest.  For 8 years I avoided the place until today.  I forgot to eat a hotdog on National Hotdog Day...or...more accurately hadn't realized it even WAS National Hotdog Day...or...still more accurately hadn't known that National Hotdog Day existed...ANYWAY.  I went to Steak 'n Shake (why is there only one apostrophe?  shouldn't it be 'n'?  Or does it not work that way) to belatedly celebrate.  I ordered a foot long chili cheese dog complete with onions.  Screw my coworkers, I thought, it's National Hotdog Day.  Sort of.  I used the drive-thru.  Something must have gone \"wrong\" inside.  The line sat still for 5...then 10 minutes.  Finally we moved.  Hotdog wasn't a footlong, but of course, it was too late when I unwrapped it at work to rectify THAT problem.  It tasted okay.  Paid for a footlong, ate a regular hotdog.  Waited in line for \"fast\" food way too long.    The girl at the window was apologetic about the wait.  I thanked her for her courtesy.  But it'll be another 8 years at least before I go back.  I rarely rate anything 1 or 5 stars.  But the \"I've experienced better\" that yelp defines as two stars is WAY overstating my only two experiences here.  \"Eek!  Methinks not.\" is much more appropriate."}
{"text":"Burger was not bad and was super inexpensive.  Chili was excellent but a little expensive for a small bowl.  I went here last night around 10:00pm.  The hostess there had a really bad attitude and obviously hates her job judging not b how she acted.  Just get another job if you r that unhappy lady.  She is why you get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Waited half an hour for one cheeseburger, rude service and place was disgusting and dirty"}
{"text":"This place is new, very clean, staff was very nice. This is not you traditional Steak and Shake, it models the In and Out Burger style. You walk in place your order and then wait for them to call your order number. It's a pretty limited menu also. The hamburgers were very greasy. Normally all your drippings are the condiments, mine was nothing but grease dripping. Plus was upset that their specialty milk shakes were limited to. Really wanted a very berry milkshake but just had to settle for a strawberry milkshake and did not use any strawberries just the strawberry syrup. I was disappointed.  I hope when this owner when he opens up the 5 others stores we see a stand alone traditional store. Servers who come to the tables, takes your order, serves your food on a plate. A complete menu instead of limited. We already have plenty of In and Out Burger stores."}
{"text":"During my dental visit on Saturday, Steak and Shake was highly recommended by Jen, so on Sunday, while we were in the neighborhood, we decided to stop by and check it out.  When we arrived, there was a line, on a Sunday, at 3pm!!!  It was moving pretty fast so yay!  we were hungry.  Spicy Chipotle Burger-Was good.  The chili cheese fries were good too.  Frisco Patty Melt with fries-Decent.  I missed the Patty Melt at Waffle House back in Houston Texas.  When I saw this on the menu, I had to order it.  Because I recently learned that I like sourdough, this was the choice I had to make.  After I bit into it, I realized that maybe I would enjoy it more if it was the regular patty melt.  I like it with mayo and pickles.  This one had a chipotle sauce on it, and I prefer my mayo.  When I requested for 6 slices of pickles, the waitress came back with exactly 6 as I request.  She listened to my request even though she was very busy  Turtle Milk Shake-SINFUL!!!  The caramel and hot fudge as a thick layer on creamy milky vanilla shake, topped with whipped cream, some pecans and a maraschino cherry was soooo delicious.  My friend finished his burger and milkshake, was super full, but offered to help me with my turtle milkshake.  I politely said NO.  I didn't finish my patty melt or fries, but I sure did finish this milk shake.   Pecan Milk Shake-This was good, but not as good as my Turtle Milk Shake!  I have to say this is a good deal.  More bang for your buck.  But since this isn't the healthiest thing out there, my next visit will probably be at least in another 2 months."}
{"text":"I liked the 24hrs part ! They use actual, real ice cream in the shakes, good selling point.."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of meat in between buns if you know what I'm saying...  This restaurant takes the cake for the best burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my review and nothing has changed. The food is still delicious and it came out quickly. We waited about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad. The staff, however, was still absolutely unfriendly. Our server never came back to grab us refills and handed us the check halfway through the meal before even asking us if we planned on getting shakes or anything.  I am a server. I know what it's like to be \"in the weeds\", but there were clearly an adequate number of servers on and about 6 or 7 were just standing behind the counter, so being understaffed wasn't the problem. I don't know if they're trained to get the customer in and out since they're always busy, but it just irritates me that the staff sucks so badly.   I'll most likely go back because the food is amazing, but the service is some of the worst I've ever seen."}
{"text":"So, we arrive here with our two kids and are warned upon entry that kids menus are no longer available as of 5/1/16.    What Steak & Shake doesn't accommodate kids??   My wife and I are in shock...no kids menu, no kids shake, no (gulp) race cars??  ;)  The waiter told us that the management were attempting to avoid kids walking through the casino and discontinued all of their kid-friendly policies.  Not to mention the bill is about 30% more than it would have been previously.  Sad.  Look, I get it if we're dining at Cut, or Nobu, but this is Steak & Shake???  I mean, did they completely forget about their locals?  However, instead of one-starring this terrible management decision, I'll give it an extra star for a sweet waiter that seemed embarrassed, and the lack of any line whatsoever, which is a first but I suspect the new normal."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is always a must for me mainly because there's not one in wilmington and I have to drive up to MB to eat it. It's fast food but really good fast food and not to mention the prices are great. The milkshakes are always so good and they have half price shakes during a certain time of the day. Once you walk in you get the 80s vibe with the red booth and the black and while tiles. It's a really great quick and easy place to get a good burger."}
{"text":"Ok who doesn't enjoy destroying a damn good burger and appetite killing frys. That and the price tag will surprise you! Always leave this place super full and an satisfied."}
{"text":"Visited this Steak and Shake on a Wednesday afternoon with a colleague, we stopped in for a quick lunch right before attending a conference downtown. Turns out, this was not such a quick lunch. My receipt shows from the time that I ordered my meal to the time I picked it up at the counter was 29 minutes. I got the peppercorn bacon burger and fries with a soft drink. While I found a burger to be tasty, the fries were dark and greasy, seems like the oil needed to be changed a week ago. We were nearly late for the conference considering the wait time, I had just under 10 minutes to down my food before walking to the conference. This is lunch time folks, this is fast food, people need to eat and go. Such a disappointment, I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This location is an embarrassment to the Steak 'n Shake name.  Why open a location with a menu selection of 1/20 of a regular Steak 'n Shake restaurant?  Very disappointing to say the least.  I went to this location because of my experiences at other Steak 'n Shake restaurants.  If this location was the first time I went to a Steak 'n Shake restaurant, I would never go again.  Please don't think this location reflects what the other locations offer."}
{"text":"Ok, for those who complain about the fries and food here, I think some are a bit extreme in their reviews.  The food here is ten times better than any of the other fast food shops in the area.  Their burgers are always fresh and everything is at a decent price.  When I eat here I do not feel like I just coated my insides in a ball of grease like I do across the street at McDonalds.  Yes, they do have skinny fries and that could be improved but that also helps add to the feeling that I didn't eat the most fattening meal ever, like again, across the street makes me feel.  The staff here are friendly and polite and it's opened 24/7.  The shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Steak 'n Shake. Being that I'm pescatarian, I had to find a \"burger\" that best suits my lifestyle. Therefore, I chose the grilled cheese sandwich and it was yummy! The cheese was melted just right.  I ordered it with thin fries seasoned with Parmesan Cheese and Herb, (Yep, I ate fries this time around because I told myself I would run it off afterwards.) along with the sweetened tea. The tea was just right for me. Not too bland and not too sweetened. I am not much of a sugar baby.   But of course, I gave in and ordered the \"Very Strawberry\" shake. It was a little watered down and not as thick as I wanted it to be. However, it was refreshing.   Overall, I had a great experience at the Steak 'n Shake in Las Vegas! The service was great! Now to run off these calories to make room for more."}
{"text":"Food was definitely better the second time around. Fries tasted just fine. I realized that a double steak burger meal with fries was less than $5!!! My only complaint this time is that the restaurant really needed to have the condiment bar cleaned up. Ketchup, ice and trash everywhere. There was an employee cleaning everything but the most dirty part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I generally like Steak n Shake but this location lets me down.  It is located in the vacant city view shopping center.  Food is OK, but service is usually slower and less helpful (sometimes downright stupid) compared to other locations.  Not my favorite location."}
{"text":"I do like their freshly made burgers which taste better than most fast food fare. I like being able to customize toppings. This location has always had friendly service. Order may take a bit longer, but freshness is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I generally like Steak N Shake, but this location leaves something to be desired.  Not the sharpest servers.  Not the cleanest location.  Your basic menu, but could use a service upgrade."}
{"text":"I do like Steak & Shake burgers among fast food burgers.  This location is convenient to the turnpike and highway and in the midst of the Streetsboro strip of hotels and restaurants.  Nice dining room with good service and drive thru.  A good choice to stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I like the Steak N Shake menu, but experience has taught me that the dining experience is variable.  The service can be very slow, as it is here.  Food is OK, which is why you come anyway.  Their basic burgers and shakes are great.  Everything else is OK."}
{"text":"I like Steak n Shake burgers over most fast food brands.  Service here has been timely and friendly.  Nice variety of burgers and sides and breakfast items.  A little bit out of the way, but worth finding."}
{"text":"I like Steak 'n Shake burgers.  This location has generally good, timely service.  Speedy drive through, nice service in the restaurant.  Burgers are available from simple with your choice of toppings to seasonal specials.  They also have sliders, beef hotdogs and breakfast items.  They have a soft drink happy hour in the afternoon.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"We had no idea this casual burger joint existed in the middle of South Point Hotel. We were too lazy to travel to the main strip and opted to remain within the confines of the resort. We knew we wanted burgers, fries and milkshake. Long behold there was Steak and Shake tucked in the far corner on the casino level. This burger chain specializes in retro diner themed food. The booths, seatings, wall graphics, checkered flooring and even server uniforms matched the theme to a tee.  Seating was quick and easy. The hostess sat us in a nice booth with a centralized view of the whole restaurant. We were provided menus and a brief explanation on the burgers and what sets them apart from everyone else. I went for the bacon lovers and steakburger, fries and a Nutella milkshake. The serving size for the milkshake was large enough for 2 people. The shake was rich and creamy. The distinct taste of Nutella just made the shake even more decadent. The bacon lovers and steakburger was nothing short of short amazing. The patties were thin and flavorful. There was a generous amount of bacon and cheese. There was nothing special about the fries however were crispy and adequately cooked.   The service was fast, friendly with multiple check-ins on how we were doing. The prices were reasonable and I wouldn't hesitate coming back to try the other burgers from their menu."}
{"text":"Take me back to the old days of burgers and shakes! A replica of \"Arnold's\" from Happy Days is what it is all about here. Great burgers, shakes and different flavors of fountain drinks! Definitely a must when in the area of the South Point Hotel and Casino. Also a favorite of the hotel guest!"}
{"text":"It had wonderful shakes and delicious food our waitress Lala gave us wonderful service"}
{"text":"The thin cut fries were great, service was a bit slow but their ice cream sundaes are good. I did ask for light fudge on my sundae but it did not happen. Oh well. Still good."}
{"text":"They were very busy. Waited about 15 mins to be sat-our waiter warned us that they were busy and there were long waits and it was getting \"tense in the back.\" We only ordered shakes 2chocolate, one strawberry. It took 48 minutes."}
{"text":"Nothing was good at all. Fries were too salty. Burgers are smaller compared to average. Taste...mediocre. Waiters are so forgetful. Had to remind one re my son's Oreo shake."}
{"text":"On our way out of Vegas and my buddy from Chicago convinced me to try this place. Same 50s diner experience as so many other places. Menu showed some huge variety of burgers and some really good prices. But it was when I got that burger it was heaven. Bun, meat, so so good. I was even thinking of ordering another burger when I was done."}
{"text":"9pm on a Sat night and wait was about 5 min to get a table.  Service with Jason was very friendly and burgers were tasty.  About the only down side was that we didn't get our shakes until we were almost done with the burgers, but hey, thats dessert....  Best part is that dinner only cost $21 for both of us.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a friend (after 9:00 p.m.) and it was a good experience. I ordered the portobello Swiss burger, fries, and a mint cookie shake. My bill was under $10. Gracie did a good job. My friend ordered three sliders and he too enjoyed his meal. My only complaints are that the restaurant could be cleaner, it took several minutes to get a seat even though the restaurant was two-thirds empty, and it took forever to ring out because there were four guys in the kitchen just standing and talking."}
{"text":"The girl name Lala she was very friendly and always made sure we were okay  !!!!!! I like her attitude very great worker (:"}
{"text":"Poor old Steak N Shake...Not much steak, and a horrible shake.  We decided to have Steak N Shake for dinner because it has been a while since we have eaten there last.  After waiting about 20 minutes/eternity with two children under the age of 5, we were finally waited on by a very nice server.  I really should have read the Yelp reviews before we went in.  It looked like they may have been under-staffed.  So we ordered and waited.  The kids were enjoying the hats and cardboard cars they were given.  First came out the shakes.  The waiter was carrying three shakes-my full size shake and two kids shakes in styrofoam cups.  As he set them on the table, one of kids shakes spilled out on the table...almost the whole thing.  The waiter offered to bring more whipped cream and a cherry. Ha!  He spills half the shake and offers to replace the whipped cream.  Great customer service.  My shake was a Reeses cup shake that had Reeses in only the top quarter, and It tasted like cigarette butts, which I hope was maybe just really old Reeses and not cigarette smokey fingers stuck in my shake.  Yuck.    Our meals came out in a decent amount of time, but they were sub par.  Fries-old and cold.  The best part was the guacamole burger.  This burger's main draw is the guacamole.  Check out the picture I posted-a teaspoon of guac!  Hilarious and sad all at the same time....you can't make this stuff up."}
{"text":"I'm currently not allowed to eat fries -- i know, it's a sad sad world I live in. But I decided to throw that rule out the window one day and make a trip to Southpoint to grab some Steak 'n Shake.. hehe woops.   Woops indeed. It wasn't like I remembered it. Yea they were shoestring fries... the kind I absolutely adore, but it just wasn't cutting it. They were so incredibly thin and a little on the hard side that I couldn't even get close to be satisfied at this indulgement. So I ordered a milkshake to go with it (yea I'm the worst dieter in the world...). I went with the mint chocolate cookies & cream. Again unsatisfied. It tasted like it came from the bottom of the machine..you know, that nasty metal taste? Yea... blegh.  One thing that made me not absolutely hate this place was the sliders with the Frisco sauce. If you're deciding which sauce topping to go with your burgers, nothing beats the Frisco sauce. Burger itself was mediocre.. it's the sauce that makes it more enjoyable.   This place just isn't worth all the calories.. I'm still glad I fed my craving though. I know now that I won't be craving it for a very long time, and they have an awesome burger/steak seasoning I got to take home. If you collect seasonings like me, that's something you need in your collection!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable. When I go back to Vegas I will make sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Here's the Scoop: The burgers and shakes are sooo tasty. Fresh lettuce and tomato on burgers adds a great taste. Shakes so thick you need a spoon. Flavors include fresh bits of fruit. Fries are delicious! We stopped in for a quick snack before our show and this place hit the spot. Hope they continue with great service and food. Decor has old cars parts that adorn the walls that remind you of an old soda shoppe. Check them out for a great burger and shake"}
{"text":"Don't let the long line deter you, we went for dinner and probably were in line for 20 minutes, it wasn't terrible.  The prices were about $5 for a burger and fries.  I got a boring single cheeseburger with everything on it, and I scarfed it down.  The bun and the meat were so soft and so good.  I liked that the patty was pretty thin.  Most of their special burgers come with 2 patties.  The fries were good even though I don't prefer shoestring fries.   The onion rings were really good and crispy, the food arrived pretty quickly, the waitress was very helpful (Kaz or Karen), the chili 3 way (on spaghetti) was good, too.   They also sell chili in cans to go for $2.99 each.  The vanilla coke was also perfect - not too much syrup.    The others in our group tried the Chipotle burger, Buttery Wisconsin and the one with a fried egg in it.  They all were happy.   There's also a separate \"To Go\" line."}
{"text":"Had this a long time ago in Springfield, MI, was super excited when I drove by and saw it! Love they are open late on the weekends, and they aren't super expensive. $5.00 for a burger and fries! Its well worth the drive from Phoenix when you're craving a yummy greasy burger!"}
{"text":"Great people working here. Very helpful (they put my ketchup in a container for ease of eating on the road! Needed a glass of ice for my water BOOM done. Great burger too!"}
{"text":"Great milkshakes and at a value during \"Happy Hour\""}
{"text":"[ Pros ]  *Their food is good  * Prices are very very reasonable  * It's a diner themed restaurant, so it's a fun place to dine-in   * It's a good meal to eat after bowling or watching a movie inside the casino   [ Cons ]  * It's inside South Point, so you have to park in the garage & walk towards the back of the casino to get here"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced. Not friendly through the drive thru and have went there for breakfast when they didn't even answer me on the drive thru speaker so I had to leave. I've had a shake take 16 minutes and my food is always 10+ mins no matter what it is."}
{"text":"During training, someone forgot to tell the staff that it is their job to serve.  That's what they get paid for, that's what they get tipped for, that is your JOB.  If you plan to dine here, make sure you have PLENTY of time because you will not be in and out in 30 minutes.  If you're lucky you might get your order in the kitchen in 30  minutes.  This is not a one off bad experience, every single time you go it's the same story.  The servers will walk right past you again and again.  I thought maybe all S&S were this bad but had the occasion to visit one in Niles and Sandusky and they had service on par with what you'd expect.  I can't imagine how this place stays in business unless there are that many people who don't mind bad service again and again."}
{"text":"My desire to waste time today is so strong that I am now writing a review of a place I haven't been to in 4 years and that none of you will ever visit. Sentimental value. It'll trap you. When attending college in the middle of nowhere, you can usually entertain with any number of keg parties (let's not kid ourselves, that's basically what they were, even though they all had a very well thought out theme.) where you would pay 3 dollars for as much PBR, Red Dog, Natty Light/Ice your body could stand. If it was a classy party, you could imbibe in any number of bottom of the barrel liquors.   Naturally, there came a time when none of this quite satisfied a young person's quest for adventure. And when the time came, you could either be a stereotype and go to the Denny's OR you could be Awesome and go to Steak & Shake. I spent many a night here eating delisious cheeseburgers (I usually went for the \"Frisco\" burger on sourdough with the special \"Frisco\" sauce - a strange sign of things to come) and sipping on enormous chocolate milkshakes along with fellow Obies. We always stuck out like sore thumbs, our dark clothing & overwhelming air of elitism (it comes along with the 30K a year tuition). The cheeseburgers were actually pretty good, in the fast food sense but the fries were WEAK. Don't bother. Should any of you Californians find yourself in rural Lorain County, that is."}
{"text":"If you come to this location, be prepared to wait unreasonably long and getting some attitude if you try to rush them a bit. People do not work properly. They hang together in the back laughing at jokes instead of cooking and serving."}
{"text":"One thing everyone needs to realize is that this is the only location on the West Coast so far and just opened. Yes there will be a slight wait, but well worth it! The last time I had a Steak-n-Shake experience I was in Dallas, TX and it was 2 years ago. Ever since I've been dying for them to come out to Vegas. The combination of their amazing steakburgers, skinny fries, and double sided shakes is to die for!"}
{"text":"2 words: BUTTERY WISCONSIN. That should already say it all. The burger was sooooo moist and, literally, tasted like butter.....like it was cooked in 5 sticks of butter. I don't mean to scare you into heart attack city but, it was soooooo delicious.  And this is coming from a self confessed \"non burger eater.\"  Their bbq burger is really good, too. Lots of bbq, onion fried strips and grilled onions on there. What's not to like!  Thankfully, I went with a big group and prolly tried all of their milk shakes: mint-choco, banana, dark chocolate, chocolate, reece's peanut butter, prailines...all were really yumm...  The best thing about steak and shakes (other than the burgers that is) are the prices. Most burgers were under $7 and they came with fries!  Just a quick note: They are really busy so, expect a line. Or go there semi-hungry because there is a wait. You know what they say, \"Good things come to those that wait...\""}
{"text":"The burger was awesome and they have really good fries. They are the shoestring type. The food came really quick. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I go the service is fabulous and sometimes it's horrible. I took my grandmother out for dinner after our long day & the waiter had our food sitting out there for 10-15 minutes up until I said something. The manager came to us and we told him our waiter was very slow and he said the bill was on him. Besides that I would say food wise is the best Steak 'n Shake I've ever been to."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped here for breakfast at about 8:00 on Saturday April 23rd, 2016. There were no other diners. My daughter order chocolate chip pancakes, and I got the bib breakfast- eggs, sausage, hash browns, toast.  Waitress appeared new, but nice, food came out fast (I would hope) my daughter took a few bites and then started finding some small round flat things in her pancakes. I told her they might be crispy chocolate chips from the flat top. She cracked one, and said it felt more like plastic. I took another one and bit it. It was plastic. Of course the waitress was nowhere to be found, so my daughter took her plate and found her, the waitress apologized and said she would have them remade, my daughter returned to our table. The waitress went to talk to the cook, who became extremely defensive (mind you we were seated almost as far from the kitchen as we could have been, and we could hear his attitude- we could see the grill). There is absolutely nothing wrong with my food. Do they want to come up here and watch me cook? Et., etc.  the waitress returned to whatever she was doing and he started recooking the pancakes. A few more bites into my hash browns and guess what- Plastic. I called the waitress over and showed her. She was confused and asked if I wanted more. I said I don't want anything off that griddle until it is cleaned, the cook calls the waitress up to get the pancakes, and she brings the to my daughter who starts inspecting them-in front of the waitress, and there is another piece of plastic. We had to pretty much argue with the waitress to take the pancakes off the bill. I was pissed and paid for my breakfast (I ate half of it before finding the plastic) Corporate is going to hear about this.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"I resisted going to the place for years. Why? Well I heard about it and thought it was utterly retarded that they have Steak in their name but don't even have stakes at all. They might as well have just called themselves corn dogs for what that is worth. Just utterly stupid just on that alone.  But I FINALLY agreed to try it when out with my mom and sisters one day. I must say I was NOT impressed at all. I wish I had stuck to my guns of not wanting to go to a place that had an improper name for itself.  I recall wanting to get a shake and there was some issue. I can't recall and considering this place sucks and is stupid I don't care enough to try to remember why. I want to say we had some other issue with the server too but don't remember that either.  The food is average but MUCH TOO SMALL. The amount sucks out the wazoo. I had to ask if they accidentally gave me a child's portion. SERIOUSLY. I had to get a 2nd meal. Small, SMALL portions! That totally blows.  I so hate their stupid name that is lying to the public and their lousy portions that I didn't even care enough about any other problems we had with this dump.  I will NEVER be back to this or any of their other locations."}
{"text":"August 1, 2014  Oh Steak N Shake! I love your $3.99 burger and fries deal! Never have I ever seen prices like this for burgers! Their milkshakes are uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh YA-UM! I wasn't hungry before I ordered, but right when my food arrived, I ate like I was starving for days. Come and experience what I experienced! You will surely be satisfied."}
{"text":"I love the food - love the prices - !  I just find it disconcerting when three older waitresses sit and gossip instead of tending to customers. No drink refills - no \"how is your burger?\" no - hey ya want a shake for dessert? Just amazing good ole American food - poorly served!"}
{"text":"I remember loving this place when I lived in Florida. It brought a lot of nostalgic memories back, and when I finally heard they were bringing it to Las Vegas I was stoked! It's cheap, affordable, and the burger is just divine. Of course, it is called \"steak-and-shake\" so if you're ordering a burger, you must accompany it with a shake. Choose. CHOOSE! From the array of selections and if you just can't decide, well you can make your own!  My sister makes this wonderful shake that I highly recommend. It's an oreo shake mixed in with fresh bananas. The end result tastes just like banana cream pie. I tried their seasonal shake which was the salty caramel pretzel shake. I think the idea of salty and sweet was what bought me into that choice. However, I wasn't too fond as the flavors was just way to strong for my taste. Maybe a little too sweet? Or too salty? Or both? Not sure, but I'd give it that shake a 3. If you're into the salty and sweet, I'd recommend it, but in the end I did wish I got my favorite. The Turtle shake. Delish! A perfect combo of chocolate, caramel, and nuts.   I also recommend their mushroom and swiss burger, chili, and spaghetti. Something about that beef makes you want to \"steak-it-and-shake-it\" haha get it?  Anyway, if you're looking to have a little casual fun with a throwback diner feel, and an affordable place to take a date, lunch, dinner, or what not. This could be your go-to spot. You can go wrong with sharing a good shake. FOR TWO PLEASE! :)"}
{"text":"If someone takes your order, consider yourself lucky.    There was literally one waitress covering every table in the restaurant.   After 20 minutes of waiting for someone to at least get our drink orders, we gave up and left."}
{"text":"Took my grandson and my wife out for our monthly visit for burgers and a movie. We also invited his friend and Dad. what a surprise their burger and fries went from $3.99 to a minimum of $6.20 and the ice tea went from $1.00 to $2.49 and no kids menu so our bill literally more than doubled in a month from around $30.00 to over $65.00. This is no longer a good value.  They have lost a regular customer. Besides our income hasn't doubled in the last month."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries.  Small menu, and no salads.  Just fast food.  Not good for this area.  What are the owners thinking.  Won't last long.  Uggggg Could be much better."}
{"text":"Wow, you can get a great burger and fries in a Vegas casino for under $5? And a great burger too. Wish we had this in Canada."}
{"text":"Long wait and very busy. I had a Bacon Cheeseburger, fries an a ice tea for under $10.00 and was not bad at all. I though the place had a ton of choices and a decent burger the meat is a little thin but good enough especially for the price. Much better choice than white castle or other places out here. Plus they have a million shakes which i was too full to have so  I will definitely be coming back for seconds and try one of the shakes."}
{"text":"The food is on-par with other Steak & Shakes in Central IL.  This review is not about the food.  Its about the service.  I would chose any other Steak & Shake in the area than this one.  They are always crowded, under-staffed and slow.  The seating is strange, too many 2 top tables that they don't use for 2 people...The wait staff seems to be overworked or under-managed most of the time.  Always waiting to be seated, waiting...for food or shakes, waiting to get the bill, waiting at the front to pay.  Its a pain in the neck and I LOVE the food so I deal with it, but I hate this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, as a kid I didn't get it.  It wasn't until I am older that I love their hamburgers.  You have to get a double to really enjoy the taste of the meat.  I'm so glad that they are finally moving out west.  Someone please open one up in Camarillo."}
{"text":"This place is sad. From the time we walked in until the time we left I witnessed so many things wrong the health board would shut them down. First a waiter eating a bag of potato chips on duty at the bar talking to 2 girls.  Then the guys cooking the burgers starts talking to them. He puts on one of the girls sunglasses and continues to cook. Then he gives them back and plays with he key chains. Then cooks again. Never washing his hands and never wearing gloves. Then I see our waiter come out of the back eating food as he is getting our drinks, meanwhile no manager in site. Finally after about 20 mins the manager Lewis comes out of the back for just a bit to talk to a couple waitresses and drinking margaritas the night before. This place is a total joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Me n my son live here! The shakes are amazing and the meals are really cheap ! Don't go here if ur on a diet!"}
{"text":"Food was fast , girl taking Our order was unfriendly , place was dirty , need to be swept and tables needed cleaning , you could see when they mopped with a dirty mop , lights needed to be fixed and bulbs changed , food was marginal . Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"My first experience in 2013 was really good, food was great, plentiful, hot and tasty.  Service was quick.  My 2015 experience I was not impressed.  Food took forever, it was cold,  everyone in our party received our food cold.  We received our shakes after our food when we would usually receive it before.  I won't be coming back here to eat when I go visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fast food done right, what more can you want?  A throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price.   My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off!   I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also \"splurged\" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?  All in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries. I come here often and try to get something different each time. The service is great. Sometimes the line gets long but it moves fast. Since it is in the South Point. If I don't get Steak n Shake here, I get it when I visit Ohio."}
{"text":"Would've given TWO stars but the butter-toasted bun pushes it up a notch...  Very much like Freddy's Frozen Custard but without the Chocolate Ice Cream (custard). Shoestring fries just aren't my thing. And the Bacon Double Cheeseburger was just okay. Couldn't taste the bacon like you do at five guys...and no fresh-grilled smokiness like FG either.  As far as ambiance, it's Fast Food Grade but even the patio tables were being wiped down diligently, which I appreciate.  Doubt we'd go back unless it was the only thing around. Gently"}
{"text":"More like Steak 'n Shake Express for this place. They have a scaled back menu, and seemed to be out of basic condiments like ranch dressing and to go ketchup at 7pm on a Thursday. The place was kinda slow, no lines and plenty of open tables. Prices are more expensive than the casino version in the South Point Casino. The South Point restaurant has a full menu, and seems to always have a line, and we have yet not been told they were out of anything there. I hope they expand to the true menu, and figure out how to operate with out running out of the basics. If not there is always the South Point Steak 'n Shake restaurant."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is perfect for a happy medium between going out to eat and getting fast food.  It has the feel of an old fashioned milk shake restaurant you see on tv.  It is a nice place to spend a meal with someone else, for a low price.  The steak burgers are of an increased quality compared to most fast food burgers, but the prices are not.  Hand dipped milk shakes are almost a must with every meal because they are so delicious.  I ordered the garlic steak burger combo with onion rings as a second side, and a western BBQ steak burger just the sandwich.  For the drink I got the kit Kat milk shake.   I strongly recommend trying the frisco melt, mushroom and Swiss, and every shake on the menu."}
{"text":"Line was long, but it moved very quickly. We were in in 20 minutes or so but it was definitely worth the wait!   Burgers and fries were delicious and the milkshakes even better! We ordered the portobello mushroom burger, the philly burger, and the royal burger and everyone loved it!   Not to mention, I have never been to a restaurant that took care of customers with food allergies like these guys did. I told them about My sons peanut allergy and they immediately notified the manager. They got all new items (meat, buns, condiments) from the back and also made His milkshake in a completely different area to prevent cross contamination! Normally other restaurants would just say, sorry that's made in a zone with nuts so you can't order it!  Very very satisfied with the service and the food here! I never take the time to write reviews, but definitely felt this one was necessary!"}
{"text":"It's so shitty it's hilarious. I mean the food is Steak 'n Shake so basically the same as the rest but the service is so absurdly slow it laughable. I come here semi-regularly because it's on the way home. Expect a wait (I mean wait 20 minutes to be seated with one other person in the restaurant wait) even during non-peak hours. It's almost like they try to be slow."}
{"text":"How is this location not shut down yet. Bad cooks, Bad employees,  and the manager \"Tracy\" is very rude. The atmosphere is unfriendly. I will never go back to this restaraunt when cook out is right next door."}
{"text":"So I went in to redeem my free birthday meal And I showed the waiter on my phone the coupon and he advised me that they couldn't scan the bar code  (what year is this?) and that I would need to print it out.  Went home and tried to print only to find that it says that it's already been redeemed.  Talked with customer srv. Online and they reissued and I printed it out.   Then when I went back to the restaurant the cashier said that it should have my name on the coupon.  Well the original one DID.  Apparently customer srv. Sends a generic one.   Whatever.....he accepted it after making me feel like I was a liar.   Loooong story short it was the grossest petrified piece of meat that I've ever seen.  Couldn't have complained if I had even wanted to because the waiter never came back...ever!  One consolation is that it was free and I didn't have to make a big deal about it and I could just throw it away"}
{"text":"The boy working the drive thru was COMPLETELY RUDE! Told us to \"feel free to never come back\" when we waited to place our order for over 5 minutes with repeated attempts to see if someone was going to come back! As we pulled around to go to McDonald's instead, he told us to go F... ourselves and gave us the finger! When my husband went in to tell the manager, the boy came out from behind the counter and acted like he wanted to fight with him! Completely unacceptable! The manager actually told my husband to stop swearing and he was only telling him what his employee said to us!  I've never been so appalled. Instead of apologizing to us he acted like he wanted us to leave! Very poorly run establishment!  No one has EVER talked to me like that! Shameful!"}
{"text":"Steak and Shake used to be such a great place to go for really good burgers at a decent price. BUT, today was my last trip there. I went through the drive-thru and ordered the Cheesy Cheddar Burger, no exceptions. I wish I knew how to post a picture but I am a non-technical person because I would love to show everyone the PANCAKE of a burger I received. There were not vegetables on my burger although I never said I didn't want them, the bun was completely smashed flat. There was some cheese between my two smashed flat burgers but the picture on the menu and what I received were not even close. What a disappointment. So much competition out there and Steak and Shake will never survive if they can't keep up the quality. It's a shame."}
{"text":"We hit this place at HAPPY HOUR which meant the shakes were 50% off.  I got fatter just reading that.  Much like a Sonic, their drinks/shakes are amazing.  Unlike a Sonic, their food is actually very good.  I took a bunch of folks from St. Louis there and they were happy as could be.  I was trying to push In N Out on them, and they agreed to go provided I tried their go to burger joint.  It was very good.  The burger definitely has a different taste to it somewhere between a burger and Salisbury steak.  If you hava ha hankerin for some SnS and you're in Vegas, shlep on down to the South Point.  It's pretty much the only reason to go there ever."}
{"text":"This shift right now is a bunch of chaotic children who forgot their home training Hire adult supervision..... Our waitress and a few others of course are rockstars"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Awesome selection of unique burgers and sandwiches. Tastes great. I recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok...I dont even know where to start.  What is the big fuss about? This place had mediocre burgers, the chili was something a 2 year old made, and the shakes were not impressive either.  The best thing this place had going for it was it was cheap.   Honestly...wont be back to this overhyped excuse for a burger joint."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever!!  I went here on a Thursday afternoon and they weren't even that busy.it took the waiter 10 min to acknowledge us and another 20 min just to bring us our water,and we only got that because we had to get up and ask for it.we ordered a simple cheeseburger and shake.the people that arrived after us with more food received there first.we finally got our food and it was ok.worst service ever!! Definetly not going back"}
{"text":"I like the old fashioned soda shop theme.  It takes awhile to get your order taken.  I highly recommend the salads there they are plentiful, crisped, and yummy.  However the salad we ordered to go wasn't as plentiful.  The burgers and fries are good and there are a variety of choices. My great niece ordered a shake ... wow, thick and rich.  She couldn't finish it and was helped out by my Mom and Dad.  The prices are reasonable the service is lacking but, it's a good value and I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Quick place for an inexpensive, not high quality,  meal. Good for kids, great milkshakes."}
{"text":"great value if you want a simple all american hamburger at a throw back diner.  Cheaper or same price as a fast food chain but made to order and much much tastier!!!! Good Burgers, good Fries and good Milkshakes at a very reasonable price. Good Kids meal options at a great price."}
{"text":"Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin, but crispy. They aren't bad. The prices are also quite decent. However, their shakes are amazing. Thick and creamy. It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am."}
{"text":"This place is good. The line was long to get in and it was full of happy customers. Music and vibe was great. The shakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Fun place! The 4 of us had burgers, fries, sodas & shakes for around $40. It was all delicious & fresh and we left full!   My only complaint is that you have to wait to get in, the restaurant is pretty small. But, the food came out so fast it made up for it!"}
{"text":"Finally, they are more generous with their French fries!   Ate here the other day with my family & was very pleased with our experience. I ordered the jalapeño crunch steak burger with Parmesan fries. The burger was delicious except it wasn't crunchy! I think the oil from the burger made the fried onions really soggy but it was still very yummy. My mom ordered the grilled chicken salad & we were impressed with how massive the salad was. My dad ordered the portobello and Swiss steak burger with salt & vinegar fries. The salt & vinegar fries were amazing, it made my Parmesan fries taste really bland lol. I also ordered one classic strawberry milkshake which was really good, & I'm not a huge fan of milkshakes. It wasn't too sweet and the consistency wasn't too thick either which made it very easy to drink unlike other milkshakes that just get jammed in the straw.   Overall, they have good burgers, amazing shakes & great prices. The only issue was the service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"Have never been to a Steak 'n Shake before, but have heard things about it! Went in 3 days after they opened and it was pretty busy but not to bad. They had someone give us a menu as we entered and was very nice! All the employees were very nice, so service gets 5 stars.  I ordered the Western Burger with fries and a Cookies and cream shake! Thought i had to because it had shake in the title so I needed to try them out! We waited about 20 min, not bad with how many people were there. We took food home since there was no where to sit.   The burger was AWESOME! Tasted fresh, bun was good and the toppings were great. The shake wasn't very good. It was icy and had really no taste."}
{"text":"I love the food, and especially the wonderful shakes, here. But we (2 in my party, and 6 other people in line) should not have to wait when there are NINE open tables. There is no hostess and the servers move like zombies. WTH? Luckily, when OUR server, Kristina Watkins showed up, she was great. She even offered water with the shakes.  She salvaged my opinion of this restaurant! I just changed my review from 3 stars to 4."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a 0 * I would. Absolutely the worst customer I've experienced at a fast food restaurant in years. I wouldn't recommend this steak and shake or any other Steak and Shake to buy your dog food."}
{"text":"I was really surprised that Vegas stepped it up and put a Steak 'n Shake in the valley!  I come from Chicago, where Steak 'n Shakes are all over the place.  They no longer sell the Tuna Melt, which was what I always ordered back then.  This particular Steak 'n Shake doesn't give you the extra large Oreo cookie to go with your Oreo shake, whereas they do so everywhere else I have been to.    Located inside South Point Casino, there is almost always a line to get seated here.  We went around 11pm and  were seated right away.  Their food is excellent all the time and service is quick."}
{"text":"When they won't even seat you at the counter when you are a single \"without asking everyone in line\", they can go pound sand!  too bad Bradley Ogden closed. He had the best burger EVER!"}
{"text":"if you love the simpleness of a burger no fancy stuff then this is a place to check out. flavorful and affordable. i basically built my own burger from their classic. fries weren't the best ive had but i still enjoyed it. cant forget about the shake, thats what closed the deal for me... best shake in town in my opinion, not too thick and not runny either almost velvety smooth. if you need a burger fix this might just be the place. just beware of looong lines."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was hoping for the best,  especially since they have banana milk shakes which is all time family favorite.  The decor is cute however the staff lags on cleaning up tables.  Speaking of the staff, the two guys were too busy slacking off while the cook was taking orders and making the meal.  Oh, and the banana milk shake tasted like tapioca pudding so clearly not real bananas.   We ordered 2 Signature steak burgers, which looked good but ended up more like Signature grease burgers on stale bread. The meal comes up with shoe string fries that were greasy, burnt, and when I got to 1/2 way in the box were more like the crumbs of french cries of fries, REALLY!  We ate 1/2 our meal and pitched it, not worth shitting on the potty the rest of the night.  Yes, that greasy!   I would suggest going to the chuck box down the street.  But hey, thanks for the wifi I posted this review with."}
{"text":"Glad I got a Groupon and didn't pay full price, that's all I have to say. They were understaffed. They get one star from me bc they were apologetic for the wait. Literally waited 40 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers and 2 french-fries. Not very good at all. The workers didn't look clean. Fingernails were dirty, clothes were dirty. The whole place was a mess (inside and outside). The tables were dirty. There was trash all over the floors. One of the soda machines was down. Soda spilled all over the floor which means super sticky floors. You're lucky if you can find a clean table. Everything I mean EVERYTHING in this burger joint needs a major deep cleaning. I definitely won't be going back ever again. I could have gotten a better burger at Wendy's for sure."}
{"text":"Always predictable food. It's steak and shake. Little slow with drive thru orders but usually ok and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I always get the meal with 2 sides and use my mailed coupon. go out about once a month   for years now. I get soup,salad, burger and dark chocolate shake. the food is fast,fresh and I have never had a problem. they have  accidently given me extra fries and did not charge.this place has been consistently good and fairly fast for the price it is great!"}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place to me, and it was the worst burger I ever ate on top of that my service was bad I should of walked out and ate a burger at five guys....."}
{"text":"Well... as Steak 'n Shake locations go, this isn't the best one around--but it is burgers and fries that are open 24-7.  The milkshakes are good!  PROS:  Always made fresh, when you order;  CONS: Greasy (but its burgers); Takes longer than typical in drive thru (but that's bc they're made fresh!); Service (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being awesome) is a 4."}
{"text":"Ugh. Long waits, noisy, burgers are like beef jerky and food comes cold. I've ate at Steak n Shake all across America and this one is by far my least favorite."}
{"text":"So, we arrived on Sunday May 1st and we were told that as of that morning, they had discontinued both the $4 menu as well as the kid's menu. Lucky us. The food and service remained excellent, but now my $4 meal is $6, and that 50% price increase drops them from 5 stars to 3 stars as it kills the value portion of their ratings. Other locations still have the $4 menu, but this one no longer does.   So my Vegas trips will still likely include one trip to this Steak N Shake, but it will no longer be a multi trip, must recommend to all my friends and family, kind of place. Pity."}
{"text":"I will always say that Chic-Fil-A is the best fast food in the business.  I still say that, but Steak 'n Shake is nipping at Chic-Fil-A's heels.    The food here is spectacular.  Very very good.  Prepared just right, hot, tasty, and plenty of food per serving.    The price is unbelievable!  Less than $12 fed both of us and we were full.  They have all kinds of \"little things\" that make it an over the top experience.  Real plates!  An actual waiter!  Silverware!  At a fast food joint!!  It's seriously great.  The only thing that was a little lacking was the service.  Oh, they did fine, don't get me wrong.  I didn't feel offended, I got what I ordered, and my drink was always filled.  It's just that I didn't feel like like they were rolling out the red carpet (for that... Go to Chic-Fil-A)  Honestly a great place to eat with good food and unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. Great food and excellent service! The patty melt is my favorite:()!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend on a Friday night.  The line was extremely long so we decided to order take out.  After a 20 min wait we ordered.  We had 2 burgers and 2 shakes.  The food was ready in about 5 mins but we waited another 25 mins for the shakes.  It was not a pleasant experience.  I wouldn't go back again.  The food was just ok and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Been here a few times,  food has always been great and customer service has also been good. .. burgers are really good!  Shakes are a plus"}
{"text":"Took 10 min in the drive thru lane before I even got to order.  Why is the order box so far to the end of the line that 5 cars makes it impossible to order quickly.  I thought my whole drive thru would take 10 min.  I hope this is just because you are new. I've been waiting for you to open but if it'll take forever to get items I'll skip it.  If food takes so long make people pull up to spots to wait instead of making it so much longer by delaying orders."}
{"text":"THE BEST! Get your double steakburger with cheese and have them put an extra slice of pepper jack cheese on it. It beats the In-n-Out 'Double Double' HANDS DOWN! This comes from a 'Californian' who grew up on In-N-Out.   Also the fries are great with cheese sauce! The shakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I've heard a lot of good things about it. I was kinda surprised when I saw a double steak burger for 3.99. And I was ultimately disappointed when our food came . The only way to make the burger or fries to taste even a little good was to cover them it ketchup or their special seasoning. But I did finish my burger because I was hungry . And the thing I was most excited for , the m&m \"milk shake\" was even more disappointing .. It tasted like a mixture of dry wall, dirty water, skim milk , and crushed m&m's with whip cream on top . I guess you can go here if your craving a burger but don't be too disappointed when your food arrives. It is very cheap though."}
{"text":"While here for a convention we stopped in for dinner. My daughter has a gluten allergy and Jason went above and beyond helping her with menu choices that she could have. I had the 3 way and it was delicious and very affordable service was super fast and the restaurant was super clean. Thank you to the great staff."}
{"text":"I was the first lunch customer of the day and ordered the bacon double cheeseburger. The waitress was ok and the food  was ok, nothing special. The fries were different from what I've had at Steak N Shakes in the past and I wouldn't want them again. What prompted this review, however, is what happened when I cashed out. The same waitress met me at the register, reached her hand to take the check and my money, made change, closed the cash drawer, then walked away. Never said a single word, not how was your lunch, thank you, have a nice day, kiss my a**, nothing. Just shameful."}
{"text":"Okay. So I have a weakness for Steak and Shake. A love hate relationship. Some I love, some I hate. This one was just okay. First, it was Sunday around 1:30 PM and packed to the rafters (if they had actual rafters). There was actually a wait list. Can't remember the last time I had to wait for a table at S & S. It was less than 10 minutes. Our waitress said it was always crazy like this on weekends. The food was the usual good quality. I was a little disconcerted to bump into our waitress as she was going in to clean one of the bathrooms (spray bottle and mop in hand). Not something I want to see before I eat ( I hope she washed her hands after) = TMI. I know they probably have to take turns doing it, but wait until after your shift ..."}
{"text":"We like to take our kids here when we shop in Gastonia. Great shakes and they have a shake happy hour where they are 1/2 price. The kids love the hats they give out plus these little cars you can put together (although I seem to always be the one putting them together!). Service can be spotty. We love the Jalapeno crunch burger - spicy and yummy! They used to put Fritos on them but now do french's onions = still good. Their fries are what we really crave - nice shoe string potatoes. Yes, the patties are thin and wide - that's the burger style here and has always been. If you're lookin for big and juicy go to a place like Chili's. However the prices here are cheap, the food is good and half the time we eat there it seems like our kids get to eat for free."}
{"text":"The service was amazing very friendly waitress the burger was perfect and it comes with fries for the perfect price that's a plus it's hard to find that these days you usually have to order everything separate that's how they get you.... also got strawberry banana shakes they were soooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a 'real' Steak 'n Shake, then don't go this restaurant. Burgers are not as good as all other locations.  They try to wrap the burgers like In and Out burgers, not sure why; if you order the double it is so flimsy it looks just like a single."}
{"text":"This place is better than the reviews suggest; the food is better than Red Robin's.  The shakes are very good and I like the turkey club and the vegetable soup. Their fries are good but not great. I haven't tried their burgers.  I don't recommend the garden salad; it's not bad, just unremarkable: they scoop out shredded lettuce & carrots, diced tomatoes and avocado, & shredded cheese, fail to toss the ingredients, add little cups of salad dressing, and call that a prepared salad.  The floor of the restaurant is greasy; they need to clean it more frequently. The bathroom has been reasonably clean for me, on multiple visits.  Their prices are quite low."}
{"text":"The drive through service here is abysmally slow. It doesn't matter what time of day it is either."}
{"text":"$3.99 for a double cheese burger and fries? Yes, yes indeed. They also have other specials for the same price, definitely worth a try. But, if you get a shake, then you'll pull out a bit more cash. I think they are around $4 each. But, they have a great selection of shakes and the guys that ordered one in our party were very happy they did. They are good sized shakes as well.  It's in the South Point Casino, there's usually a line but it moves fairly quickly. Affordable good food if you're in the area. Also of note, at certain times, the sports book has hot dogs for less than $2 so if they line is too long, you can still grab a reasonable bite inside the casino. But, I like their burgers, they have different types of fries (experiment to see which you prefer) and the shakes are great. Give it a try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was the most horrible experience at a restaurant I have had in years!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was there at around 9pm, with about 9 folks from my family (visiting relatives included).  There were several things that got me annoyed, one after another.  I was ok that it took a while for us to be seated. But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it.  What made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time.  The food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold.  We were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even.  I paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\". Wow.  After about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left.   I have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up.   We have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes and never even got drinks. There were only 5 tables. Three workers were just standing there on their phones. Rude, terrible service."}
{"text":"Bland burger, burnt fries, and awful service. Came here late night and was greeted by a straight-faced, woman who never made eye contact nor smiled once. Understandable. We ordered burgers and fries, and 2 of our 4 orders came out wrong. When given our actual food, the burgers had no real flavor. The fries were too crispy and left a burnt aftertaste. One of us waited 15 minutes for just an order of fries because they had given it to someone else and didn't realize it until we told them we never received our order. Overall, a frustrating and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Steak & Shake I'm AZ; the first time I tried this place was in Orlando. I've since seen them in Ft Lauderdale and Miami, but never on the West Cosst until today. Unfortunately, everything from beginning to end was a huge disappointment. I should note that the service was great, however, aside from the service this location needs lots of work. Every table was disgusting. There was no attempt to clean the filthy tables until o asked of one could be cleaned for me. The excuse I was given was that they'd been hit by a large lunch crowd; that's fine, except it was now 3pm. The food was under seasoned and boring. I expected so much more.  I will not return."}
{"text":"The greatest service a human being could ask for! The manager Chris and the 2 servers Christie and Emma catered to my needs as a customer like I was a king (plus they aint bad lookin either ). A def 5/5, would recommend to friends and family. These guys deserve a raise!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Stake n Shake after running errands. We were approached at the door promptly and seated right away, but then we waited at least 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table. It's snowing; the restaurant was empty except for two other tables of people. Just as we start to put our coats back on and plan to walk out, a waiter comes to our table. We got our food fast but the waiter did not offer refills or dessert. Instead he and another staff member were behind the drink station being chatty. It's going to be awhile til we are back. Food was good but not great. Customer service needs serious work."}
{"text":"Just to be clear, there is no steak.  It is a burger place. Think \"In and out\" with way better french fries and great milkshakes.  Very clean and new.  The waitresses have to wear black mini skirts with black boots (feel sorry for them in the summer)  You order at the counter, they give you a light up pager to pick up your food.  The organization of the counter is a little screwy because to get to the drink machine you have to cut through the line of people waiting to order.  The birgers are good, again very similar to In and Out burgers.  No complaints.  Fries are very skinny and taste better than most.  Milkshake was good (hard to mess up a chocolate milkshake) and this location has a really nice outdoor patio on Mill Ave so people watching is cool.  It is a good burger joint but competing with Five Guys, In and Out.  I can imagine going back there again but it isn't a top spot in my book."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots to bring our granddaughter after a long week of school and work. I was disappointed in the service this evening. The server started out attentive but than all of a sudden we never saw him again until we were finished eating. Never checked back, forgot the ranch dressing for the onion rings, no extra napkins. Maybe 6 servers wasn't enough?"}
{"text":"service is awful. server never refilled my water or cleared the table. We had to send both of our meals back. I also won't be taking the extra drive to the Akron steak and shake from now on because their service is even worse. What's going on with this company"}
{"text":"Ordered the philly burger with cheese fries. Food wasn't that great compared to an in an out burger chain. Burger buns were soggy why i don't know. Fries were really thin shoe string could of past them up. Peanut butter shake was okay again nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Went inside, you order at the register. There was only one register open and a man ordering for 15 minutes. He proceeded to make phone calls to get more orders... I was not very happy with the customer service as there were 10 employees behind the counter including the manager watching and not offering to take my order or open another register. Considered just doing drive thru but decided not to give them my business after being so frustrated."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting how not good this location is. Inconvenienced hostesses seat the party before you without even acknowledging your presence. Disinterested, apathetic servers that ignore requests like \"we need napkins\" until you have finished your meal and erupted your hands on your clothing. Cooks meet my food quality expectations, but give barely child sized portions on side dishes. I have not seen one staff member smile the entire time I've been in here today. I consistently return to the Rt 51 location because I get decent and consistent service. This one? I only returned because I was getting my dog groomed at the nearby Petco."}
{"text":"For fast food, the burger was real good but the fries were disappointing. They cut the fries really small - not good for trying to pickup especially if you like ketchup. Had a milkshake which was really good - so thick I could barely use the straw but they gave me a spoon, too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Steak 'n Shake... but not their burgers. Shocking, right?  What I love are their breakfasts. Seriously, Steak 'n Shake breakfast is a hidden gem and one of the best-kept secrets in the world. More people know about Area 51 than about the pancakes here. More people know about chemtrails than about the delicious silver-dollar hashbrowns.  For less than $7 you can get a nice, tasty breakfast, a cup of coffee, and you're outta there. For $10 you can get more than you can comfortably eat (with a cup of coffee).  This particular location is usually pretty decent. They now have wifi, which helps pass away a lazy Saturday morning, and the staff is usually good. This location is very, very quiet in the mornings. That suits me fine, so if I write this review and the place gets hectic, then all that means is it's more likely to stay put, which also suits me fine.  Here's your new marketing slogan for breakfast, guys:  \"Steak 'n Shake breakfast. Who knew?!\""}
{"text":"Service is the WORST I've ever experienced. Every time we've attempted the drive thru when the inside has been closed, and there has been no line (aka no demand), the service is despicably slow. Cannot advise against enough. Wish I could give less than one star."}
{"text":"I'm Here In Champaign For A Week (On A Business Trip). I Decided To Explore My Options Since I'm Surrounded By Nothing But Food . Well I Chose This Location (Basically For A Late Night Meal Since Its 24hrs). I Ordered A Jamacian Jalepenõ (Don't Judge Idk If That's The Correct Sandwich Name Or Not But Something Of That Nature) With Fries & A Snickers Milkshake. When I Walked In There's No Sence Of Urgency For The Customer (Which Was Me). The Guy That I Seen Behind The Counter Was Doing A Million Things At Once So He's Running Reg. Drive-Thru & Fries (As Far As I Can Observe). So When He Was Ready To Take My Order I Had To Verify That It Was Me He Was Talking Too Because It Sounded As if He Was Finishing Up With A Drive-Thru Order As Well As Trying To Start My Order (I Could Be Wrong But Iknow What I Heard ). After I Recieved My Order I Didn't Check It Before I Left The Store But When I Got Back To The Hotel I Noticed That The Sandwich Was Absolutely Amazing But The Downfall Was That My Fries Where Soggy & Lukewarm (So They Served Me Some Fries That Had Been Sitting Out & Starting To Get Cold). I Then Took My Fries Back Up There & Requested Fresh Fries.   Pros : Pricing , Burgers , Milkshakes , Cleanliness , Quick   Cons : Freshness (Fries) , Customer Service , Sence Of Urgency    Recommendation : I Would Say Steak & Shake Would Be A Great Place To Go To If You're Looking To Save Money , But I Wouldn't Recommend This Location Exactly"}
{"text":"Rainy days call for their chili! I grew up with Steak n' Shake in the midwest so when they opened a store out here I was so happy to have a taste of home again. It's nostalgic AND delicious. The prices are pretty cheap and they have a daily happy hour on their sodas. Steakburgers are nice and juicy but they can make the bun a little soggy. The fries are...ok, nothing special. The milkshakes will bring boys to your yard so please be careful."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. Puts an otherwise decent chain to shame. They should have their franchise rights revoked.   Each time I've been through the drive-thru, I've had to wait to place my order, wait to pay, and then pull up to the waiting space and wait for my food.   They are \"out of\" things that are featured prominently on their menu. They don't listen when you order. They're always running behind yet seem to have a fair amount of people staffed. Poor management I guess.   I visited earlier today and there was an ice chunk in my sandwich! I imagine it's from the produce being in the fridge, but still gross. pull your head out of your rear and pay attention to basic details!   I've worked in fastfood, i know lunches are busy, i know there is always one less person than you want for the late night shift. I \"get it\" to an extent. But this location goes beyond the bounds of my already overly generous patience.   Do yourself a favor and go to meatheads, or if you're strapped on cash, hardees or taco bell, or McDonald's or any other place within that half mile stretch on Neil."}
{"text":"The food tastes great but service not so much. Julie is the only reason why I'm giving this place a such a nice rating. She alone is carrying the whole team with her attitude,her spirit , and her smile. When she is not working service is very poor. I come Mon-Fri during happy hour.  I normally order a very berry strawberry shake with sprinkles (5 star rating) and a large Onion ring. Occasionally I will will order the number 1 which the the double steak burger meal (4 star rating  burger is always dripping is grease) . If she is not working my onion ring container is half filled. Once an employee dumped a regular order of onions into a large container after the person in front of me stated they didn't order them. When I said something about my order she just I could wait and speak with the manager. After waiting 30 minutes,the manager remade them correctly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't know about the food. Couldn't get seated for 10 minutes when it was empty then 15 minutes later no one took my order. Bummer"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go and have fun, eat some great food, and have some awesome ice cream!  Look OUT calories! LOL, MMMM,  BUT YUMMY!  I LOVE THE FRIES Yum Yum Yum!!!  It so reminds me of the 50's diners, because of the atmosphere, music, and uniforms!  The staff is very professional, food is warm to the table, music is playing, and the restaurant is clean!  Being in South Point Casino is even better Eat and Play the slots how fun!  or even go and see a movie!  Totally recommend for all to go!"}
{"text":"To use FREE Steak 'n Shake Wi-Fi you must download Yelp, seriously?  And their Wi-Fi is so weak you can't use it?  Jocelyn was our waitress and she did an awesome job!  Food was hot/drinks as ordered - fairly priced and the app makes paying a breeze.  Do yourself a favor, don't even think of going into that pigstye of a bathroom!  Does make you worry about the kitchen sanitation?"}
{"text":"Located inside South Point Casino. Exactly what you expect from a diner themed \"fast food\" restaurant. It is a lovely place to be able to grab a Coke on property considering all the places on the strip have to serve Pepsi. (Gross.) Service was fast and more than friendly. It's nice to have a reliable place to count on for a quick cheap meal on a busy day in Vegas. My friend had the spicy chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it. I had the double burger. The best part is it doesn't have elevated prices just because you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price! Be ready to wait in a line even at odd hours in order to eat here though."}
{"text":"having a handful of kids to watch this place was perfect. it had a good selection of things that kids love. its kinda like a rubys diner. it had good food but the shakes were ok. thank goodness this place was in the hotel, i would have been in trouble feeding the kids."}
{"text":"Not sure what people were thinking that thought this was a good burger.  At best it's average but  there are so many options.  Fries came out warm and the onion rings were over done.   Go to In and Out instead."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but waiting for 30+ minutes in the drive thru is a little crazy!! Maybe they need to hire more people!"}
{"text":"My brother is gluten intolerant which often means no hamburgers because many places use wheat gluten to add coloration. Steak and Shake was able to give us all beef and even made French fries in a separate batch of oil so his fries would not be contaminated by onion ring breaking.  As always, my burger was delicious, too. The patties were not too greasy and the fries were crisp.  The manager and server were both extremely friendly and accommodating, which makes us even more loyal. Many places are not quite as friendly for people with dietary issues."}
{"text":"I was running errands in Brunswick, and decided to stop into Steak n Shake rather than clog myself with one of the usual fast food suspects on Route 303.  I arrived around 5 PM on Saturday, April 12.    One would think that 5 PM on a Saturday could be considered the start of \"dinner\" time.  But you'd be wrong here.  This Steak and Shake looked like it had been hit by an IED.  At least six tables had shit all over them--glassware, dirty plates, crumbs.  Unless en entire daycare outing had just left, there's no excuse for a restaurant to be filthier than a Vietnamese brothel.  In the meantime, I'm sure the teenaged waitstaff was busy solving the world's Important Problems, because that was the appearance three of them gave while they ignored the bombing of Dresden that had taken place around them.  I watched these three clowns shoot the shit for 10 minutes, while not one of them so much as came over to say, \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  Maybe the manager--or hell, the OWNER--can teach his staff how businesses make money.  These guys obviously don't care.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Whopper at Burger King.  Even the dump I took afterward was a better experience than waiting for the Second Coming at Steak n Shake."}
{"text":"This place doesn't come close to ok. I wish I could give a negative star.  It wouldn't have been better if I didn't have to listen to staff babbling about tips and other negative comments.   Had a bacon and cheese double steak burger. Not that good for the price. The fries suck.  People that give a good review must work their or their girlfriend does."}
{"text":"The drive through tonight was EXCELLENT MAN. They handed us our spoons and straws and then we looked in the bag and there were MORE SPOONS AND STRAWS! Like, we never will need spoons or straws again. And when my friend asked for a side of ranch, they gave her TWO SIDES OF RANCH. Thank you Steak n Shake. All is right in the world."}
{"text":"Went with some friends.  Burger was good, root beer float was good.  Server was nice, and efficient.  I think stick with the \"original\" burger, and you can't go wrong.  I think some of the \"newer\" or \"fancier\" burgers aren't as well executed ... that's why I say stick to the original.  Prices were good."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting this place to be a restaurant but fast foods joint .. Foods are amazing and delicious AND affordable !!! I love the chilis and Swiss mushroom burgers !!! The fries, yumm !!! Curious about the onion rings tho, next time !!! Reminded me of tasty burgers back home in Boston :)"}
{"text":"Usually I loooove this place. It is huge in the Midwest. Made a special stop and burger was awful. Cool, bad flavor.good fries tho."}
{"text":"Lizzie is the best manager. from the moment we walked through the front door she made sure we had the best experience. super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Really great food st a great price. The shakes were so good they weren't  too sweet just the way I like them. The burgers were delicious. I recommend the onion rings over the fries. The cheese on the cheese fries wasn't that great. My second visit I asked for a neopolitan shake which wasn't on the menu and they made it no problem. I would say 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Okay, upon entry the greeter wasn't too friendly, but the server redeemed this place with her sunny disposition. The service is quick and the meals are very inexpensive, they pretty much have it down-pack get'em in and out as this establishment is quite small. So, here's the rub, during our dining my foot kept getting stuck on the floor only to realize that it had not been cleaned under our table... half of a burger and fries on the floor. Really. Seriously!  And I noticed that every single worker (cook) was a minority, come on. We were the only people of color in the diner; I'll give them one for having a server who is a person of color.   I'm starting to think that Pittsburgh,  with all its fantastic arts & entertainment, is not a friendly vacation or weekend get a way spot for people of color and that's kind of sad cause I'm liking my visit.  But, based on price, taste,  and fast service it is worth going to for a quick bite...just check under your table for food. IJS"}
{"text":"Super weird experience here!!!!  Positives -food is cheap  -$4 burgers -$5 shakes  Negatives -they sat us down at a table that still had the tip $$ from the pervious customers -our burgers took a little long to get to us -after about 5 mins of eating I needed a drink refill and my server never came up to check on me -I asked a busser that was cleaning a table if I could get another coke -a manager from the back came up to the table asking if there was a problem, I politely said everything was good just needed another coke, he said he would get right on it. Five mins later he is still joking around behind the counter and no refill -server comes to the table now 10 mins after the manager to check on us.   Needless to say they did not get a tip. The food is cheap and that's great but customer service could have been a great deal better."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be overrated with all the rave ppl gave it when it first came to town. I was expecting to be disappointed but I was surprised. We ordered a few different burgers all with double patties which are a must because they're pretty thin, similar to in&out patties. Good flavor, bun was good, they have soo many toppings to choose from. The fries don't cone salted so u have to season it yourself. Now the milkshakes are the best I've had, super thick & yummy. Also prices are pretty fair for the food u get. Can't comment on the service since we got take out which was pretty fast."}
{"text":"On a subsequent visit, the shakes arrived promptly, the food also.  The waitress was also nicer/better then our first visit.  I had the wisconsin buttery, which was yummy."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. The servers were polite, sweet, attentive , pleasant. The food was fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked. Will become my favorite spot when in town.  Had the Guacamole burger so yummy.  The jalapeño had me a little nervous but it was perfect not too spicy. Hubby had the Portobello burger and it was equally good. Lala & Kapriece kudos and thank you for your great service and attitude"}
{"text":"I like the food and the staff is usually pretty good. I've had one or two mediocre experiences with the wait staff, but nothing too bad to make me want to not come to this particular Steak & Shake. The food usually arrives fairly quickly and the staff is usually nice. Service can be pretty slow when they get busy (no real surprise there), but otherwise no problems really to mention.  I'll be going back there again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Came here after work for the first time with my boyfriend for a belated Birthday meal, we weren't sure if we should bring it home or eat in but good thing we decided to stay!!!  The manager Anthony provided AMAZING customer service, he was funny, personable and even brought me a surprise Birthday Cake shake for dessert with sprinkles and cherry on top! (even brought 2 spoons and straws) Our server Santana was great too! She has a genuine personality and was prompt with our order and checking up on us, even the food runner that brought us our burgers was funny and had a great attitude.  I don't know exactly what I expected on my first visit here but I was pleasantly surprised, they really exceeded our expectations and made us both loyal Steak & Shake customers! Thank you Anthony!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Terrible service! I'm a huge fan of steak and shake, but this one just doesn't measure up to the normal standard. We sat at the table for a whole before we were even greeted by the waiter, then we waited a LONG time for our food. When we got the food it was luke warm like it had been sitting there for a long time. We told the waiter that we would like a shake after the meal, obviously, but we never saw him again. Had to call over another waiter, then go up to the register area to order the shakes.  So, in short... It was a disappointing experience. Wouldn't recommend this Steak 'n Shake to anyone."}
{"text":"I always look forward to coming to Vegas and going over to steak and shake!  Steak and shake is a burger and shake shop over at the South Point on the South end of Las Vegas blvd 15 minutes from the strip. Their shakes... Are amazing!   I usually go with the ultimate banana but you  can't go wrong with any of their premium offerings. Food is really good as well and prices are more than fair! If you're looking for shakes and a burger between losing pennies on slot machines, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  After several visits over the past year or so, one thing is consistent.  The service sucks.  They are inattentive, slow.  We stood at the door for about 5 minutes to be seated while this girl chit chatted with her co-worker. WHAT?   She seemed bothered to have to take our order.  She wasn't pleasant at all.  Here's a tip--don't be a waitress or work in the public.  It's too bad I like the food or I would never go again.  But the food is good and cheap.  When I went to pay, three customers ahead of me came in from the drive through because their orders were messed up.    #getbetterhelp"}
{"text":"Prices are low, food is decent. Gave a 2 star rating because I was not told that substituting american cheese with pepper jack cheese incurred an extra charge and the cashier very obviously rolled her eyes when I asked her about it. Also, the Cajun fries are just their regular fries sprinkled with the seasoning they have on all their tables yet is an extra $0.29."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Put in a tapingo order at 2:04 and they lost it. They gave me the wrong order at 2:35."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a 5-star review as I don't want the lines here to get too long. I see a lot of negative reviews...but, then why are the lines so long?  I'll make it simple: I was in Vegas for 2 nights and I ate here twice.  And I was willing to wait 20 mins in line for their burgers.  In Michigan, you NEVER have to wait that long for Steak N Shake.    Come on, Steak N Shake...open up more locations in southern California (Orange County)...not snooty L.A."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of Yelpers to see what the fuss was about. It was pretty busy the night we arrived. There were only 8 in our group, but they still had to split us up into 2 groups in order to accomodate our party.  The ambiance is meant to be retro,  a 50's burger joint. Lots of red and white porcelain tile and vinyl seats, reminds me a lot of the interior of In N Out. The menu has a lot more to offer though. Several in our group enjoyed mixing and matching different milkshake flavors, I stuck to my old standby.   I tried some of their sliders as well as one of their burgers. Their signature steakburger was very good, the meat was nice and moist. The sliders, due to the size of the patties, I think, were a little drier. That's why I liked the A1 slider the best, it seemed to be the moistest.  Service was not the friedliest or quickest, slightIy below average. I found myself waiting for refills on my ice tea. Overall, there are worst places to go to for burgers in the South Point Casino."}
{"text":"I'm always nervous going to casino cheap restaurants. This one was fantastic. The steak burgers where so good, I had to order a grilled cheese just to see what it would taste like. It reminded me of my childhood, huge bread and like 3 slices of cheese."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with the food quality and the treatment I received upon eating at this establishment. I ordered the Frisco Melt and it is not as advertised. They show it as a double stacked type sandwich but it is \"two patties side by side\" - Manager AJ Never eat here, go the the Jack in the box right by (it is better in comparison), or any other place on Mill!!!!!"}
{"text":"Boo to the line that accumulates at this joint, but I finally got to try it since its recent grand opening.  I like that it is situated at my favorite casino!  My favorite since it is near my house.    Unfortunately, I had a bad experience.  I ordered a regular cheeseburger and fries and it took forever to come out after I waited forever to order it.  When I got it, I was super excited to bite into it only to find that every bite tasted like mustard.  They put way too much mustard in my burger and I was extremely disgusted.  I immediately became really annoyed because my boyfriend was happily enjoying his burger.    I will have to give 1 star for the price and 1 for my fries as well as my boyfriends burger.  Lucky for me, he gave me 1/4 of his burger so that I can get the mustard taste out of my mouth.  He also enjoyed his shake, but I'm not really a fan of milk shakes.    I will try it again since I'm at this casino often, but for now, sorry folks, I still prefer In n Out over a mustard burger."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from here. Not a cool way to hang in vegas. One other person in my group got sick as well and we ate different things."}
{"text":"Good place to go when you feel like a burger and shake. Its part of the South Point casino, so you may have to walk through cigerette smoke to get to the door. There is often a wait to get a table. Not a lot of variety on the menu, except for those core items, which is enough. Milk shakes don't come in a seconday tin. For some reason I kind of expected they would. So don't expect to split it.  Overall though, Steak 'n Shake can make for a nice afternoon or evening with a burger, fries, shake and a movie at South Point."}
{"text":"This place has consistently the worst service of any place imaginable. If you go in the morning when the actual adults are working it's fine. If you go around dinner time or when the high school kids are working...forget it. They take forever to serve you, forget your orders, rarely give refills, and their tables are a mess. One time I was there my server actually dropped our bill off the same time as our food and just left! We had no one else take us. My friends and I were in shock and laughed at the situation because when does that happen?"}
{"text":"A 3 1/2 stars to be more precise.  Be prepared...be very prepared...for a friggin' long line!  Especially on weekends!  Line seems to always be out the door and the tables crammed with diners.  It's like being in like for Black Friday!  Thank goodness it's in the middle of the South Point casino close to the sports book instead in the freezing desert!  It does get kind of ridiculous. We were in line for a good 45 minutes before being seated.  The inside is cool, very reminiscent of old 70's diners with the nostalgia feel.  Like the red, white and chrome all around...almost like a classic tricked out lil' GTO!  But enough about the ambiance, let's get to the food!  Honestly, I've had a better burger.  I was kinda expecting to be WOW!  But it was more of a, uh...wow.  Got my balloon a little deflated there.  The shakes are fatty good, and the burgers are A-OK but overall I was just...OK.  This is what I wasted all my time and gas for?  An OK burger.  Not disappointed, but not 'I gotta eat here every week' either.  For what it was it was pretty good.  Decent food for decent prices.  With the line outside always there you would figure this place gave out free kisses from pre-Seal Heidi Klum (yes, for arguments sake she was way hotter back then).  The menu was good and the prices were very reasonable, especially the 4 meals under $4 each that caught my eye.  This is what I stuck with since it was our first time there.  Your 4 choices were:  a bacon cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a triple burger (no cheese), and chicken fingers.  Each meal was served with thin-cut fries.  The fries were awesome (ask for em' cooked well) with lots of ketchup.  My double cheeseburger?  Meh, it was ok.  I mean, seriously...WHERE'S THE BEEF?  My lack of 'steak' made my head 'shake'.  No quarter pounder here?  I loved the charred edges but damn, no juicy beef in the middle?  So of course, my burger ended up a little on the dry side.  There was no re-creation of a Carl's Jr. sloppy burger commercial with Kate Upton in little clothing.  It left me a bit disappointed.  The shakes are great though (but cost almost as much as a burger).  The cookies and cream one was a fav of mine.  But not for my hips, my glorious hips!  They are definitely on the full flavor side...the shakes, not my hips.  The service was good but very rushed, you get the feeling like they want you to order, enjoy your meal quickly, then pay and leave for the next folks in the gargantuan line.  I would come here again, but only if I was already on that side of town and it was late night."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately upon entering things, Megan our waitress took our drink orders immediately. When she came back with our drinks she took her food orders, and our food was out within 5 to 10 minutes. It was all hot and delicious, my kids milkshake was also delicious.  Second visit, seated immediately drink orders taken. Blah.... I was charged for guacamole side that had no flavor. Burgers were good, nothing to brag about.  Went to Arby's after so we wouldn't starve later.     LAST review. Seated at once, waitress was training a new employee. Got drinks quickly. Then the food. \"New\" cheddar double burger had more mustard than cheese. I'm just glad I got a side of cheese to make the fries edible."}
{"text":"Decent burgers with a hell of a selection to choose from.  Not great but better than most fast food joints.    They also have a great selection of shakes as well.  The shake quality is just okay (I'm an ice cream snob so I can tell the difference).  If you have kids then they don't give a crap and will love the shakes.  If you are looking for a high quality gourmet burger then go somewhere else.  Steak and Shake is somewhere between a Wendy's and Red Robin."}
{"text":"The line took forever, order and pay for our food just to be pulled up to the stop sign. Cars behind us got their food but were stuck because we were still waiting. Finally get the food and head home. Get here and the fry cups are only a quarter full. My son's kids meal had more fries than the 3 adult meals. The burgers weren't right and everything had a layer of grease. The cups all had drink running down the side. Poor service, bad food, DONT DO IT!"}
{"text":"This place Bloooooooows. An hour and a half to eat here. Shakes took 25 minutes. Food 40 minutes. People who work here are nothing short of \"special\". Place is filthy. Honestly I don't know how the health department hasn't shut them down. The franchise needs to come and take a serious look at what is going on here. Oh yeah almost forgot to mention $50 for five people to eat GARBAGE. If you go here after this review please humor yourself and actually WATCH a burger get cooked!!!! Holy crap what did I eat???"}
{"text":"We are locals in Nevada, but from Atlanta. Super excited to see a steak and shake here!!! Food was excellent and our server Lala was the best! Thanks Lala!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two burgers with no pickles because there was a pickle allergy. This phrase \"pickle allergy\" was mentioned with each burger ordered, after we asked for a drink and at the end with a firm \"pickle allergy, so no pickles anywhere around them\"! After getting a \"yep, no problem\", we paid and sat down. This was not communicated to the prep guys, which I sat and watched take the pickles off the burgers, wrap them and place it in the bag. If I did not see this, well, I wouldn't be writing this right now because we would be at the emergency room. But Luckily I saw it. This was the first and last time we will eat here."}
{"text":"Way better then In n Out in my opinion. The line to get a table is always long no matter how fast the staff works. They should have doubled the size when building it.  Once you get a table though and order the food comes out fast. Shakes take a bit longer though. The burgers and chicken are good. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The biggest problem is they don't take the app so if you have a gift card make sure to have the actual card physical there and not loaded into the app or you can't use it"}
{"text":"Not to thrilled with the take out section of this Steak n Shake.  Received my order and it was completely wrong.  Did not get the food that I ordered."}
{"text":"I've gotten the strawberry and chocolates shakes, and tried some of a friends burger, and tried some fries. In-n-Out's shakes are much better, they're much milkier. The shakes here were kind of icy and I really could have done without them. But I thought since the name contained the word \"shake\" it would be something worth remembering. The burger was wimpy and the fries were too. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"It has been a decade or more since I have eaten at a Steak n Shake, back when I called Seattle and the Northwest home. It was great to find out that there is locations in Las Vegas. The restaurant here at South Point is that of a 50's style diner where they even play music from that era too. We were seated in a booth by the hostess and ordered table side where the server takes our order and brings the food to the table.   Our server was very friendly and helpful at taking our order. She wrote our order down on a little white note pad it is nice to see they do order taking here old school. We ordered the western bacon burger and the double bacon burger for our main entree. The cheese fries sounded so good with our strawberry and Oreo shake so we had them too!  The cheeseburgers here were really good and all cooked to well done. The bbq sauce on the western bacon burger was exceptional good since I also requested pickles on the burger to which made it even better. It gave this burger a sweet and tangy sort of taste. The Oreo shake was really good once it melted a little since both this one and the strawberry were really thick. I did love that the Oreo shake had larger pieces inside of the shake of the Oreo cookies themselves. The appetizer of the cheese fries I did not really care for since they used liquid cheese type paste that was hard. Aside from that the twins liked the cheese fries, was just not for me. The music keeps the good times going here while the ice cream offerings will keep you real cool!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Shakes tasted great and is such a great value. I would definately come back here and bring my family. Very reasonable, the prices are so affordable."}
{"text":"The food here is ok the service tonight is not good. Our server Maribel was not even attentive. We only saw her once when she brought our food but never came back to check if we needed refills on our drinks. My husband tried to get her attention by sipping on the remainders of his drink loudly when she was standing next to us. That caught her attention she finally asked him if he needed refills. She obviously saw that our drinks were empty too but she never bothered to bring or asked me and my kids if they needed refills. I had to go up to the cashier to ask for a box for my daughter's food since she didn't finish her meals. Mind you the place was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Slow service, nice employees. Ordered a side by side chocolate and strawberry shake and it had Oreo pieces in it and it tasted like pumpkin... my chicken sandwich was hot but no mayo or condiments... Just below average but the nice employees made it alright and I wasn't expecting a lot."}
{"text":"They serve a legitimate burger here - a step above fast food, so I put it on par with Freddy's or Smashburger. They have a wide variety of toppings and specialty burgers, but I typically stick with the classics: bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink (or shake). The burgers are good (steakburgers, duh), the veggies are actually fresh, and the bacon is 2 real slices. (side note: last time I got a jr bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's, the bacon was like mini-bacon. The 2 pieces together were about as large as half of a regular slice) Best of all, the combo meal is $3.99. $3.99!!! Seriously! Cheaper than McDonald's or Burger King or Wendy's and a real waiter brings it to you! The shakes are also delicious, and there's lots of good flavors, but I try to avoid the cals if I can resist.  The only problem with this place is that there is often a wait, especially for a larger party (ie, 6 or more)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This place doesn't live up to the hype. My salt & vinegar fries were cold. I could tell they had been sitting for awhile. The burger is average. The most offensive thing was the condition of the joint. 230 on a Saturday afternoon with only about 4 customers yet every single table was dirty. With Chuck Box so nearby don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious!!!  I can't wait to go back the only sad thing is how far away it is from me but will definitely be going back  the prices can't be beat and their exquisite and decadent milkshake choices are out of this world. I don't reccomend the fudge brownie milkshake but the birthday cake, Oreo cookies and crème and my favorite the peanut butter banana one made with real bananas"}
{"text":"Do not come here on a busy Saturday. The burgers are not made to par. It was nowhere close to picture. Picture showed two patties and we received with one. Come to realize their patties were too small for the bread. When the sandwich was sliced in half there were one patty on each half of the sandwich. This was one of the Patty Melts. As I watch them make the burgers, they were flattening the meat so thin that you hardly get any meat! I gave this a 3 star because our waiter was super friendly otherwise it's 1 or 2 star. I would not go to this Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"Hmm another chain of burger joint that I been wanting to try.  Finally this last Vegas trip I was able to get around to try it out.  Got here at 8pm at night and the line was still long.  The waitress went down the list and asked for parties and we only had 2 so we didn't have to wait since there were counter seats.    I looked over the menu and decided on the Royal burger and the Mint chocolate chip shake.  The price is really reasonable.  Burger and fries for under 6 dollar is not bad at all.  Size of the burger is just enough, served with shoestring fries.  Burger tasted moist and savory.  Need to come back to try other burgers. The fries were good with the seasoning they have at the table.   Milk shake was like any other milk shake, so nothing to rave about there."}
{"text":"Located inside the South Point Casino.  There was a line the last 3 times I've been here.  Must be the weekend, but the line doesn't take long at all.  Prior to my first visit at a Steak 'n Shake, all I heard from everyone was that this place had the best burgers and it's cheap.  I have to admit, it is cheap.  But not the best burgers.  Don't get me wrong, the burgers were pretty good. Taste is similar to Johnny Rockets.  Since my belly was happy at the end, I have to give this place at least 4 stars.    Now for the highlight of this place...the shakes.  I don't normally order shakes after digesting over 1500 calories in one sitting, but was also told that I had to try the shakes.  Shakes are one of the best.  If you choose to eat here, look around.  I bet almost everyone is having a shake.  Word gets around.    I will be back...but only for the shakes."}
{"text":"I had never had Steak and Shake but had heard great things about their burgers from friends, so when we finally got one in Las Vegas I was excited to see if the burgers were really as great as some people claim.   I stopped in with some coworkers around noon on a Tuesday. There was no wait to be seated, and our waiter came around to take our drink order pretty quickly. I went with the M&M shake which was very thick, stuffed full of M&Ms and super duper tasty.  For my actual meal I really had a hard time deciding what to get. I ended up getting three shooters (what they call their sliders) with cheese added, as well as fries. The shooters were small, but well cooked and three of them were enough to make me feel like I had a good lunch without that over-stuffed feeling. The fries were well cooked but super skinny. I prefer steak fries so for my own personal taste, the fries were the only real downside to my meal.  Lunch for 6 people was $45 before tip, but only two of us got milkshakes so that's why it wasn't more expensive.   Will I be back? Now that I know there isn't an hour wait for a table at lunch, yes, I absolutely will!"}
{"text":"Giving it the same stars as my previous review.  I just wanted to post again to let people know...  Steak 'n' Shake chili is NOT Cincinnati style chili.  Cincinnati style chili has cinammon in it.  Steak 'n' Shake does NOT."}
{"text":"This has been our family's go-to place since we were children in Illinois. This location is especially great. Yes, it gets crowded on weekends, but the wait staff is still attentive, the food is always on time, and the shakes are fantastic! We have been going there with my niece since she was a baby/toddler (she's now 5), and they have always treated her well. It's her favorite restaurant, too. We generally prefer the chili 3-way or 5-way. Salads are so-so. Fries are yum-yum! Burgers are great. Breakfast, too. And all for a reasonable price. Finally, one person below complained about the runny shakes. Obviously, they don't understand what a milkshake is. If you want flavored ice cream in a cup, go to Dairy Queen or Cook-Out. If you want a hand-dipped and mixed milkshake that actually contains milk and can be sipped through a straw, Steak n Shake is the ONLY place to go."}
{"text":"The workers were quite rude and made two milkshakes wrong. Very slow service. Will not be going here again for a while."}
{"text":"The food here is ok, the service is horrific. Recently I experienced the most disgusting restroom and when I told the manager she acted as though she could care less. SAD mostly likely I won't return to this particular store."}
{"text":"What a joke.  I just want to get a burger and a shake and because I have a service animal MARIA the hostess hassles me and has to call security on my 6lb Short Yorkshyre terrier service to have security come and inspect and have a wristband placed on my bag.   I had to wait 10 minutes for a security guard to come wasn't a problem for earlier when I went to the movie theater when I walked around the casino but apparently at this restaurant they have some sort of issue I don't know.  Surprisingly I stayed to try this place out.   PERLA my server was friendly.  One of the best shakes I've had in my life and The food was decent but guess what I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK ......"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their breakfast the cooks are good the food is good little slow but a good place for breakfast haven't tried to Burgers yet!!"}
{"text":"I love Steak & Shake...  This one does not compare to the rest of the chain.  The union cooks obviously don't care about the S&S standard for cooking burgers.  Burgers are dry and served cold.  Fries were cold.  In fact the only good item I had was the chili.  It was probably made somewhere else and just reheated on site.  Servers are more concerned with getting a smoke break than checking on customers."}
{"text":"We went in to place a take out-order, a Frisco melt and a chili supreme.  20 minutes later we still don't have our food.  The lady seems irritated when I ask about our order.  They scroll back through the few orders they had to find ours  It's still another 10 minutes before we get our order. We get home to find the sandwich under the chili, smashed and missing the extra sauce we paid for.   I'd also like to mention that two people that came in after us, one got his order before us and the other never got his sandwich, gave up and left!  So, order placed at 10:09 pm (not busy) and we left at 10:38.  Never again! I wanted to add that the sandwich did not have extra sauce and the chili mac didn't have extra sauce and meat all of which we paid for."}
{"text":"Terrible service waited on the drive through for 20 at the window for our food. It was cold and the pickles had stems."}
{"text":"Find it strange that this place is even a sit down diner type. Hostess wasn't that friendly and it did take a while to get our drinks and food ordered. I will say though, a major plus is that they have both Coke Zero AND you can add a shot of cherry flavoring. That's good.  The steakburger is seasoned well. Enjoy their seasoning. The rest of the burger is quiet, nothing really happening. The bun wasn't great. The fries were lukewarm at best. Not hot at all. Cajun seasoning was cajun seasoning, nothing special. The Parmesan cheese fries were okay as well, nothing special.  The patty melt was disappointing. The patty part was fine. The bread they used looked sad. It was thin and soggy. Expected a nice thick toast for a melt.   Got a mint oreo shake to go, which made for a nice treat for later. Was it worth the six bucks you pay for it? I lean towards no. It's a fast food shake. Pretty sure shakes at Carl's Jr are something like a 3 or 4 bucks at most.  Basically Steak 'N' Shake is a fast food restaurant disguised as a sit down diner. I wouldn't go out of your way to have this experience but it wouldn't be the worst to actually eat at if it was located conveniently close."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Drive thru takes 20 minutes on a fast day. Inept staff. Close this location."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way home from the Renaissance Fair.  Being Saturday night it was packed. Our server was Hillary and we loved her. She is warm and friendly and checked with us often to make sure we didn't want for anything and that our food.was properly prepared, which it was. It was clean, the food served hot and in a timely manner and the shakes were great! We'll definitely come here again when in the area."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru around 12AM last night, January 11th. Ordered 3 meals for 3 people, wasn't very busy but still took 5-6 minutes to even take our order. Comes out to be around $20.00 which is fine. We waited for our food for about 15-20 minutes while being at the order window. As we are waiting, all we see is the staff inside throwing shit around, playing like 13 year olds. Gives us our food as if its problem and we are annoying him, doesn't say \"thank you\" or anything lol (I find it humorous as if your job is hard)  then we get our food and its all cold, missing a fry and the other fries were cold as well.   We could've went back and complained but didn't want to even deal with the service again. I know pretty much anything in the Steelyard is a bust but seriously, a Steak n Shake? Like, lets be real. As we left, I looked back to see a huge line around the building so it was clear they were now slammed. Karma is a bitch. Now I know my experience for this location and can spread the information. Should've known, coming from the fabulous Steelyard."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst take-out I've ever had.  We stopped for a quick bite to-go on our way into Vegas after a drive from LA.  From the moment I stepped in line to order to the moment I took a bit of the spicy chicken sandwich I ordered, 75 minutes had passed!  Unreal.  Granted, the sandwich was good, but not 75 minutes good.  Maybe 10 minutes good.  The whole thing was infuriating.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Growing up in the home town of Steak N Shake, I've got high standards. This location doesn't come close. The staff had always been fairly helpful (I always do takeout) but the food is so poor! Frisco Melt is always more bread, less meat, cheese and sauce. Huge let down. Fries are always kind of soggy. Shakes a little un-mixed."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know. Fast food, chain, no need to review, whatever. I'm doing it anyway.  Steak 'n Shake is a burger chain that boasts hundreds of locations. There is one such location in Las Vegas, and it is inside of South Point Hotel Casino and Spa. More specifically, it is seemingly located on the other end of the casino floor from the Silverado Ranch side w/ the parking garage and parking lot that I typically use when parking at South Point  I walked straight into the restaurant, which is a diner, but the perceptive employee at the register guessed correctly that I was more interested in takeout and directed me to the small counter on the side that serves such a purpose. I probably wouldn't have missed grabbing a seat, but I was on a bit of a time crunch, so that suited my purposes.  It felt like it took at least 7 minutes to get my order with four people ahead of me, which is on the slow end. I got the standard Double Steakburger with cheese and fries ($3.99), which I obtained for free as a result of redeeming my birthday coupon (e-mail signup in advance required).  The shoestring fries tasted a little underseasoned at first but grew on me as I snacked on them while walking out to my car. They have just enough crunch when eaten fresh, and they are surprisingly addictive even without any ketchup. They're the most similar to McDonald's out of all the fast food fries that I can think of.  The burger was actually good. It's pretty average in size as compared to a typical fast food burger. The bun is fluffy and seems to be toasted. The patties are about as thick (or thin) as you'll find at most burger chains. The meat inside the patty is as gray as a rain cloud, but it actually didn't taste dry, perhaps owing to the cheese sandwiched between the patties or to the liquid condiments. I got the burger with everything, which means one slice of American cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, mayo, and mustard. It was lacking in sweetness per my preference despite the ketchup.  I can name at least four other burger chains in town that I'd rather visit, but I can't justify a lower rating when I was pretty happy with the entire meal. Steak 'n Shake is worth an annual trip if it's not out of your way, or even a quick stop if a burger craving hits and you're already at South Point."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Steak n Shake on busy shopping weekends because it's extremely cheap and a majority of the time, the food is good- worth the price at the very least. The only hang ups are when the restaurant is packed (more so around the holidays). When it's crowded, it's usually pretty dirty and the wait can be a bummer- as expected with most fast food places. I highly recommend to STAY AWAY from gift cards!!! I asked people for them as gifts and today I tried to use two I was saving to cover our meal and the machine wouldn't read the cards for some reason. To make it worse, they had no way to manually enter the card number and pretty much told me they were worthless now despite me calling and verifying there was money on them (or so the person I was dealing with told me). So now I have several steak and shake gift cards that I can't even use. I also believe the person that took my cash after my gift cards didn't work pocketed the cash. I know that's a huge allegation but consider this: the person disappeared with the money in hand and when he returned sans cash, I asked for my receipt and change. Then he could not produce a receipt showing I had paid and I never witnessed him put the money in the till. He entered a code to open the till and manually counted out 65 cents and handed it to me. This visit was the worst, sketchiest visit I've ever had with S&S but despite that, you've got to consider the staff, location, and how busy they are. Normally, this is an awesome place for cheap, good food. If you have kids, this place and Cicis will be a godsend for you! I recommend the Garlic Double Cheeseburger. Remember- go to a good spot when it's not too busy and don't buy the gift cards! Lol Enjoy!"}
{"text":"one of the best burgers in Vegas i've had!  Burgers are good, fries are good, shakes are good.  Open late too!"}
{"text":"This SNS has higher prices , food was ok but they don't have mustard relish that is a must have on your SNS burger. I have had SNS all over the country and I was told they just don't have the relish. Well I know for a fact that it is made daily at a regular SNS it don't come in on a truck. So with the age group working at this location it must be the reason it is not available. All on all if you must have SNS go by and visit just bring your own relish and don't look for a 4 dollar meal."}
{"text":"Wifey wanted 2 try this place despite all the long line reviews we tried it anyways. Sunday night & yes just like the reviews there was a long line. It took us 20 mins to get seated not as bad as I thought but once we were seated 10 mins b4 our server asked us if we wanted anything but we were ready to order so we did. 11 Mins later we got our waters, another 15 for the food & another 5 or so for the shakes. I had the Royal very very average burger the egg was over cooked my shake was all melted milk with chunks of oreo cookies in it not hard ice cream like a good shake was which just means it was sitting up there & ready for a wile. My wife liked her burger & butter pecan shake & she'll be back but I'll be @ In & out where the Burger's R hands down the best in Vegas & your milkshake is a freaking milkshake .... I gave it a shot but I will never go back."}
{"text":"Zero. Normally I love steak and shake. Now I'll never go back. Angry employee yelling at each other, ridiculously long wait for food, dirty restaurant, cinder block hamburgers,  and fries that not only looked like shoe stings but they tasted like them too. Actually, I just tasted my shoe string and it tastes better."}
{"text":"Burgers were sandbagged (cooked ahead) and the staff were overwhelmed not their fault. Management should have scheduled better to accommodate the Comic Expo people. My daughter waited her whole meal for a shake I sent back. It ain't a Steak n Shake if the burger don't come with a shake."}
{"text":"OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu.   All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250,000 to open the new \"Signature\" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger, Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same, you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934, Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!  I've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!"}
{"text":"Waiting in the take out line. Took 20 minutes. Finally received my milkshake and the cup exploded. I walked my cup back into the store to show them and waited another 20 minutes for a replacement. By far the worst run steak and shake I have EVER been too. The storm legitimately passed over before they could replace a \"milkshake\""}
{"text":"Quick service. Our server was Lisa and she was awesome. Extremely polite and fast. Prices are super inexpensive. Chicken strip basket w/fries, burger with fries and 2 drinks- $14.00. Not bad. Haven't tried the shakes yet. The only thing is that if you are craving a burger, spend the $1.00 extra and get the double. The single is a little weak in size but has great flavor."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. No adults in view other than children who look to still be in high school. Waited over 15 minutes for my food even though I was the only one in the drive thru. Extremely poor service not to mention rude and unfriendly. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"My Favorite place to come to whenever I come to Vegas. We usually come here at least 3 different times during our visit. That's how much we like this place.  I always get the Royal Burger. And I have never been disappointed. The patty is always nice and juicy, the fried egg on top is a nice touch. All around just a great burger.  And the Strawberry Banana milkshake is perfect. Nice and thick, with chunks of banana and strawberry pieces. I already want another one   If you come to Vegas stop at SouthPoint and try this place its a must."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after hearing a lot of hype from others who have tried it in the Midwest. I had already read the mostly negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways. First of all, service is great. The female employee who took our order graciously accepted our coupons and got our order correct. It wasn't busy, so we didn't have to wait long for our meal. The facilities were as dirty as you'd expect any burger diner joint to be.  Cheeseburgers: the bun is low quality, cold and dry. The steak patties were tasty enough but dripping with way too much grease and oil. Parmesan herb fries: half of it was hard and burnt; maybe we should have just ordered regular? Red velvet shakes: nothing special but not bad, and not many oreo pieces inside.  Overall, I am glad that we tried this place, but I have to say that we could have had a similar but better experience at a Freddy's.  Maybe if we do visit again we'll try ordering some other items and see if our opinions change."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I think I am in love! Great burgers, yummy fries, and a delightful milk shakes and all for cheap! What's not to love? Why did it take me so long to try this joint out?!?!"}
{"text":"I had some time to do lunch before a meeting so I came by to give Steak n Shake a try. When I decided on that I didn't know it would take so long to get my food. Just a few ticks under 15 minutes to be exact. And when the buzzer finaly buzzed to let me know my order was ready, nobody was around to point out which bag was mine. I flagged a guy down to ask. And now I only hade 20 minutes to eat and make my way to the meeting. Lucky for me I am a fast eater.  I ordered a number 1 today. A double cheese burger with fries and a drink. The burger was fine but nothing spectacular. I've had better. I've had worse. I've had much quicker even from sit down restaurants. But I have to admit it tasted fresh. I appreciate that. The fries were fesh and hot too. They were crisp and had a good frie flavor. But they're shoe string fries which I only really like if they come from a place that starts with \"Mc.\"  Steak n Shake, at least this location, is perfectly adequate. The prices aren't terrible. The food seems fresh. But service is slow. Painfully slow. I probably wont be back but. Partly because I don't like waiting so long for a fast food burger. Mostly, though, because I am not often at UNLV at lunch time. Its not worth it for me to make a special trip to come here for a burger."}
{"text":"This place needs to go back to its original name Scarf n' Barf. Frisco Melt is a must especially after a night on Mill where you most likely made countless mistakes. Anyway this place will make you feel better but then regret it later."}
{"text":"I'm so used to Steak 'n Shake from he mid west so I was looking for the same flavor here. Fries were excellent, coke was much better (local water makes a difference) but the burger was different, the meat wasn't as juicy, still good, just not as juicy and greasy how I like it, and the bun was awful. It was edible without complaining but I was not satisfied the same as I am with the regular steak n shakes. I probably won't go back unless I'm desperate for those fries."}
{"text":"Burger and fries were good. However, I had a vanilla shake and that was absolute garbage. Would come back for the food though."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Steak 'n Shake to come to Vegas. That was my late night hangout in the Lou.  So, coming here brings tons of memories.  Clean restaurant and great food!  Make sure you try the Malts and Steaks.  After all it is Steak 'n Shake!"}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple shots at making me happy. They have failed every time. I'm a pretty simple person. I wanted water and a grill cheese sandwich. It took them 20 minutes to get my water. Were they busy? Nope. Maybe 5 other tables with customers. I nearly walked out. My grill cheese? It  was gross. I didn't even eat it. One bite and big nope. The cheese wasn't melted. The the bread not even toasted. They pretty much took bread and cheese threw them together and charged me money for it. Pretty sure my 3 year old daughter could do better. Sorry steak and shake. I'm done."}
{"text":"I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review, but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!  I was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.  I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.  For just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The service was very quick but the guy at the window definitely had an attitude. He came to bring us the food outside and he had an attitude then. There was no smile or greeting at the window just an extremely mad face. He was very rude. 1-5-18 11:25pm. Managers if you see this I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Torres and Deborah for being so accommodating to my son and family. Check out our pics!  Great Burgers and Shakes!"}
{"text":"The burgers are thin but perfect for their serving size because you get two patties. They are a little in the greasy side but nonetheless I'm not eating them everyday. I definitely try to patronize this place when I'm on the East coast."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  I go there all the time because it is a lot cheaper and easier than spending time making a meal!"}
{"text":"The food is alright, though my husband says it's not like the ones in the Midwest. This location is filthy, though. We came in on a Saturday an hour after it opened. Doubtful there had been a rush since all the college kids are sleeping. There was trash on the floors, sticky stuff on tables and floors, the bathrooms had dust on the soap dispenser (how long has it been since you cleaned that) and the stains on walls and floors meant mopping was a while before. It's a little nauseating to see that after we ate. Won't be considered back unless I'm looking for food poisoning."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about this place. Is low quality, dirty and the food was horrible. I got a grilled chicken sandwich it was so bland the chicken had no flavor and wasnt even juicy. The fries were stale. They were literally chewy fries. Shoe string fries?? More like rubbery stale fries. My 7 yr old wouldnt even eat them. My daughter hot dog had some burnt spots on it. Which if any restaurant understands a kids meal with burnt stuff on it is never good. My daughters friend ordered the kids mac n cheese. Well there was probably I'll say 3 big spoonfuls of mac n cheese in the bowl. My friend got the turkey club and she ate half of it and said she will never again return to steak n shake. We went up to the cash register to pay and the girl asked how the meal was and my friend said it was horrible and we wont be coming back. She asked if we told our waitress and we said no. Only reason why we didnt say anything is because we arent the people that go into a restaurant and complain, but the lady that asked we made sure we were honest our meals weren't good. Also we had a movie we were attending around that time and we didn't have much time to complain about our meals and have to deal with that so we just left it alone but made it clear that our meals weren't good at all. Nothing about that place impressed me. But thats just me. Just stinks because we were expecting it to be a nice dinner. I wouldnt recommend this place unless you want to waste your money on low quality food. For that price I could have went to McDonald's and at least gotten fresh, crispy golden hot fries and a cheese burger."}
{"text":"We were gambling late and wanted something to snack on, they had a window open just for togo orders and we got a couple shakes & french fries. Fries were delicious but the shakes were horrible. It was icy and gritty, gross. My first time experience was good, but this second time around, yuck. I will skip this steak 'n shake and go elsewhere for my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Ignore those negative reviews, get the original organic, and enjoy it.  It's crazy good"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I never made it here before. I finally swung in and I will say there is one thing that definitely set Steak 'n Shake apart from other burger places: the awesome service. I had just settled into my seat when Fernando made his first stop by to check on me. He was quick to get my order in and my shake was soon sitting in front of me.   I got the classic banana shake. The flavor was good, but the odd yellow coloring makes me think they add coloring. I had the Grilled Portobello 'n Swiss Steakburger. The bun was nice and soft, the burger patties were cooked in the style of the classic American diner, with that thin crispy edge. The mushrooms were a nice contrast as they were thick and hearty. The flavor combo was good. I asked for no onions, but I didn't notice till halfway through the burger that they had forgot the garlic mayo. Next time I'll make sure it is there. I'll also have them add an extra patty of beef to the burger. Two just wasn't enough. The shoestring fries are tasty, but when you add the special seasoning mix they have on the table it really pops. Everyone was very helpful, my water was never empty and I left with a full belly!  If you are in the vicinity of South Point, swing on in to Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and my last I place my order at 7:24pm I'm just now getting my food at 7:52pm the rest of the employees was moving Hella slow well at least the employee say thank you"}
{"text":"The absolute CUSTOMER WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I Have Ever experienced. Told me at 1am they too busy to even order my request at the drive thru. No one in front of me.  No one behind me. And you cannot even take my order? Worst service ever. Snotty woman in drive thru. How can you be so busy at 1am to take my order? I can see the number of cars in the parking lot! I can see the number of people here! Don't go here! They don't give a shit about customer service, or Giving you food!"}
{"text":"They are SLOW.  I was seated immediately and ordered right after I was seated.  People started to trickle in little by little (probably due to after club hours), but I had already placed my order.  After twenty minutes of waiting, a table that came in after I did got their food first.    All I ordered was a mushroom portobello burger combo and my friend didn't order anything.  Okay, so the table that came in ten minutes after us got their food first, maybe my order was already ready and needed to be served out?  Five minutes later, nothing.  We walked out.  Not coming back to this one again."}
{"text":"I like the food at this Steak N Shake.  Everything tastes good here.  The thin cut fries are my favorite.  The shakes are wonderful.  Happy hour also makes the shakes irresistible at half price!  The dining area is well lit so you can see the cleanliness of the tables and booths.  They have a good sanitation grade.  There seems to be a constant morale problem with whoever works the drive thru.  They are always angry and frustrated?  Sometimes I go inside to place a to go order just to avoid the drive thru."}
{"text":"This location is pretty much up to par with any other Steak n' Shake you've visited - great food/prices and less than stellar service.   It was 9 p.m. the day after Christmas. You would think they would have prepared for the mall crowd to venture over, but no. Not that it was busy, but everyone seemed to be running around like mad people to operate the restaurant.   Our server was nice, but made plenty of mistakes throughout the meal. My boyfriend's burger was wrong (it was a whole different burger) his fries weren't seasoned like he asked and it took forever for me to get my check. However, I'm sure it was his first job so I tried to cut him some slack. We've all been in his position before. And plus, our bill was $13! Who am I to complain?   The food is awesome, though. I ordered the triple burger and was in heaven. It was the perfect greasy dish that I was hoping for after a big Christmas meal of turkey and ham. The fries are always good, too! Though, they seemed a little bit dry. I also ordered a side salad. I'm so happy they went back to their original salad recipe because they're much more appetizing. It may be small, but for $1.29 you can't do any better.   Paying was a hassle, but isn't it always at SNS? Waited, waited and waited only for a girl to take my bill and throw some change at my face. No \"How was your meal,\" or even \"thanks.\" Too much to ask I suppose. Whatever. I'll be back. You can't say no to a meal under $4!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30minutes for the food and milkshakes we ordered.   The flipper on the table was so sticky and gross to touch.   Milkshake tasted like dish soap.   Not a good experience.   Wouldn't go back to this location.  Oh and waited in line to pay with two people ahead of me and three people behind the counter."}
{"text":"This place is really popular and good. I must say that the shakes are phenomenal and food is great. I had the sliders they were yummy."}
{"text":"Food was fine. We came on New Year's Day. & people were still coming in till 12am.  First of all, the hostess was very very rude. Not to us but to the people in front of us. They mentioned something about wanting a booth still even though they were just ordering shakes. The hostess pointed at the TAKEOUT window & said \"there's take out right over here\" which triggered my attention. Anthony or tony was out server. Service was fine at first. My friend had spilled water before the food came. Instead of tony offering to clean it up. He just threw napkins down & never tried to clear the glass or ice left on the table.  Upon paying, we were the last to leave. The lady (cashier) seemed to have the biggest attitude because we wanted to split the check 3 ways for 6 people. As she noticed I took a \"how was your visit\" slip in front of her. She quickly took down her name tag & started being nice. Didn't give us receipts & when we did ask for it; she asked why. What?!!! Are you joking. Terrible staff. I get it it's NEW YEARS DAY. (It's not New Year's Eve anymore you shouldn't have to be itching to get out) I work in the food industry & I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but this was beyond terrible service. Teach these 3 how to smile & be polite/courteous   Ps. They shouldn't use under ripe bananas for shakes, it ruins the flavor."}
{"text":"First time here! There was no line for us to get seated. Reading some of the reviews, I think that's why this place got some pretty low reviews.  Location is interesting. It's located inside South Point hotel. Great place for it because South Point also has great $4.95 steak and eggs. You can pretty much get the best meals inside the hotel.  Staff was alright. We were a table of six and it took awhile for our waiter to get to us just to order drinks. Once our waiter came by it was smooth sailing until we left.   Food is delicious. I recommend the burgers. The chili and noodles are not the best of choice for this kind of food. The fries are good and the seasoning you can put on it reminds me of Red Robin. I got the Royale Steakburger, best price for the burger.   I will definitely be back here again if I'm ever in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Steak N Shake in name only. Disappointing if you've ever been to the real thing. I'll stick with In N Out"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING.   I cringed at the high chair they brought for my son enough that I had to hold him. It was covered in dried up food and sticky.  There was a fly in my husbands food and the manager tried to act like gnats are acceptable in the food industry.  The tables are sticky. The floors are filthy.   Just go to McDonald's. Seriously."}
{"text":"It is decent food if you are wanting clogged arteries. So much grease, I have to ask for extra napkins to dap the grease from the meat."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat at if your in the mood for burgers and fries! That's not the only thing they have. BLT's and chili fries are good as well. Good quality food for reasonable price to be in a casino."}
{"text":"Ordered the sliders and there is hardly any meat it looks like the scrapings off a grill will never order this again HOWEVER my server CHERWIN was very nice about it great service !"}
{"text":"After a long drive from Columbus my husband & I ran inside of this steak & shake to place a take out order. There was a tempting picture of their The prime steak white truffle sandwich. Made our mouths water...so we ordered this sandwich with 2 orders of fries.  no problem waiting 15 minutes cause it looked soon good. We get home (starving) opened our wrapping to find a skinny little burger with a tiny piece of cheese on a huge dry bun...no mushrooms, onions or anything else on it! Not to mention our bill came to $16.98....FOR THIS PITIFUL SANDWICH!!!! So I called to speak to a manager, an of coarse she said she was sorry, but they ran out of mushrooms so this order should not have been placed to begin with! Yes, she did say to bring in our receipt & they wii either refund or replace, but living  20 minutes away, we probably won't bother. Not surprised this restaurant has only a 2 star review! AWFUL!"}
{"text":"So I finally got my fat a$$ over to Steak 'n Shake...umm yea, it's cool.  Simple order, cheeseburger w/ fries.  Nothing to write home about, the burgers are smashed to dryness, patties as thin as IN and OUT burgers.  Fries, shoestring cut...actually I prefer my fries like that, so I was ok with those but with that being said I make those at home all the time soooo, it was just ok to me.   There was all the HYPE about it, and to me it did not live up to the HYPE.  Sorry y'all, it's a reasonable, for Burger&Fries $4.69.  Will I go back, um I can't really answer that right now, IDK.  Maybe if I was still 22 this will be good to me....maybe  But this is just my opinion, check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries at an awesome price. The fries are the shoestring kind and the burgers are very thin w/crispy edges...yum!  I usually hit the drive-thru at least once a week. It's always fast and they've yet to get my order wrong. Make sure you download their app and use it to pay every single time you go. After you've spent $50 you get a $5 credit loaded to it, which is basically the cost of a meal."}
{"text":"I don't know  what was better about this steak and shake, finding mold in my fries or finding what appeared to be bits of mayo in my water, and you want to know the best part! The bread is dry and stale! Come here only if your looking for bad service and expired food."}
{"text":"I tried it. It was okay. Just okay. Long wait with dirty pager for fairly okay burger and fries. Neat looking building and decor. I think tourists might go for it more. It was not cheap and I think when I need a burger I will just go to Rehab (now in Brickyard around the corner). Service people were friendly, just slow. They cook things to order so let that part go."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, we went here at least once a week while staying in Vegas.  The food is better quality than fast food (i.e. McDonalds), and reasonably priced.  We'd often split a milkshake, which are always tasty.  Some of their other deserts are great too ($2.50 for a small ice cream sundae!).  If you're at the casino and looking for a quick/cheap bite to eat, worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here 4 days ago from a Frisco Melt combo. I was in my own personal hell for 2 full days. Missed work = lost money but worse than that I puked so much I think I may have lost a few vital organs in the process. Don't know if I will ever go to another Steak n Shake in my life but if I do it certainly won't be this one. Note to staff: Wash your effing hands!"}
{"text":"They have the finest most delicious juicy burgers & out of this world shakes- we had the banana & strawberry shake & they use real fruit !!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We came here this Saturday, St. Patrick's Day, the second day of their soft opening. We were seated right away. The nice server took our order immediately and accommodated our request, eg: if they could grill our onions in our guacamole burger instead of raw, and we specified how we want our burgers made, etc; the server asked the cook and we were gladly accommodated with our requests. Service is fast, efficient and friendly. Even offered us 'to go' cups when server noticed we could not finish the humongous shakes.  Food is very good, what's expected of Steak 'n Shake.  The Staff  are still ironing some bumps they encounter which is expected as it's still their soft opening. Cashier couldn't take gift cards  yet but stated they will in the future.  Overall, will come back here and will recommend it to friends and family. They have really tasty burgers, delicious shakes; very reasonable price, place is very clean, really spacious (the Biggest Steak 'n Shake in the world!) And, excellent service!"}
{"text":"When this place opened up, there was a huge excitement associated with this well-known restaurant serving burgers made of ground steak and creamy milkshakes. My husband was familiar with it since the chain advertised on some of the channels that aired all the baseball games. Plus he had heard from a good friend, that it was really good. We came here recently to celebrate my husband's birthday and went to a movie afterwards.   The place looks like a 1950's diner (the murals adorning the walls from the 1950's probably helped, too), with the staff wearing traditional black and whites (does it sound too fancy for a burger joint?). There is a line for sit-down service- about a twenty minute wait (this is the only location in the city, so expect it). (Come to think of it, there is a line for the takeout window as well.) The staff is very nice.   Besides the specialty burgers, there are a few chicken sandwiches and a couple salads. The prices are on average about $7.00 and less for combo meals, per person. We came here with my father-in-law and his wife. Everyone ordered burgers and I ordered a chicken sandwich (I know it sounds funny, but that's me). My sandwich was good, but I might actually try the sliders next time (curiosity), plus I know that the meat is really tender too. My husband said it was probably the best burger he had, but that it's also hard to compare it to the others (red robin, islands, ruby tuesday) since there isn't anything else like it. Oh and for the heat lovers, there is a bottle of peppers on the table. (There are bottles of seasoning and peppers for sale, for those of you you want to take it home.) The burgers are fully cooked, so you know (my husband usually likes it medium).   The other star of the restaurant is the selection of milkshakes. I chose the banana-chocolate (\"side by side\"- I know it's a weird concept to grasp) and it was really yummy. I would order that flavor again even though (it was that good) there are so many other flavors to choose from, like chocolate, vanilla (my FIL got this one), and cookies and creme (my hubby chose this one). Seriously, there are so many flavors- something for everyone, really. The average cost of a milkshake was $4.00. If you are ordering one for take-out, know that the size is significantly smaller, than if you are dining in- food for thought.   I am not surprised that the place is super popular and crowded (the twenty minute wait is a small price to pay). It's reasonable (almost like fast food prices), original (ground steak burgers), and everything is really good. Sometimes when you hear about a place, you have these high expectations, and then you're let down. But that didn't happen here. We are coming here again soon (this weekend), and I can hardly wait. I'm getting that shake again!"}
{"text":"The sit-down diner atmosphere is deceiving at this location. It is just fast food burgers brought to you by a waiter.   The steak burger was seasoned well enough. The patty melt's bread is kind of wimpy and just soaks up grease. The french fries were warm. I love shoestring fries, but I really wish that they had been fresh from the fryer instead of coming from a heat lamp.   But at the end of the day, this place is what I was used to when I was living in other locations: a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Even ignoring all the hype, this place is only worth two stars.  The ridiculous line out the door didn't help it anyway.  I ordered a cheddar cheddarish cheddar burger or something like that.  Really good cheese I will admit.  But thats the only good thing about this burger.  Didn't have any sauce that I can remember, but that is fine.  Lettuce, tomato, and bun were average.  The meat was very unimpressive.  It was thin and flavorless.  It reminded me of the sort of hamburger meat you would get at a school cafeteria.  The fries were the horrible shoestring junk you would find at in-n-out.  They don't taste like potatoes, but instead taste like whatever grease they were fried in.  I'm pretty fed up with this whole trend of thin crispy fries.  Give me steak fries.  The place is called steak and shake isn't it?  The milkshake was average at best.  Pretty much the same shake you would expect from mcdonalds.  I'll continue to go to jack in the box if I want a milkshake.  My buddy ordered the chili.  It was pretty bland and unimpressive from what I heard.  After our food was delivered we were completely ignored by the waiter.  Never got any drink refills and never got the mustard we requested."}
{"text":"I do not prefer anything here.  It's not the worst, but it's not even good enough to be my average go to spot.  I rarely/never eat fast food u less it's like in n out or seldomly at sonic/Carl's.  The patties are thin, the seasoning and herbs aren't there.  I'd rather go to Wendy's and BK or Mickey ds.  And I hvent eaten those in many years.  I'd avoid this spot, the service, wait, and everything about it falls short from the crowd outside and the ratings on here."}
{"text":"I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great. But this location is always woefully understaffed, with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated. Whether you're inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long. Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here."}
{"text":"Food is great. Wait is terrible. Typically come here at night because they are the only great option open, but the wait every time in the drive through is about 30-40 minutes. They should know that they get busy around the same time each night between 9-12am therefore they should plan accordingly. Management must help their employees, they're doing the best they can but they're clearly under staffed and have been for many months. The poor staff you can tell they're overwhelmed but trying their best."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I must say, they have good cheap burgers. It's probably better than any other fast food and super tasty. I love their fries, it's just perfect. You can order your burger with grilled or fried onions, so delicious! Try their shakes too, super fatty and mouthwatering. The only thing that sucks about this place is the wait line they have, sometimes it could go over 15 minutes. Don't forget to try their peppers!"}
{"text":"I came here with really high hopes because my wife and daughter came in and ate here on their last trip to las vegas (were from California). We arrived to a sizable line but got seated in maybe 10 mins top. The food is pretty good and prices are dirt cheap! 3 people can eat for under $25. I would have given them 4 stars but the service was complete shit! Our waiter came once to us and it was to give us our food. I was dying of thirst as well as my daughter.  We never had the chance to ask for other items we needed such as ketchup, water,  napkins etc..... our waiter never came back to see if we needed anything or to even tell us good bye.  Pro's: very inexpensive,  food is good. Con's: horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty consistent with their taste. Prices are alway great , nothing special about it but it's always satisfying . Not going to break your wallet . Enjoy."}
{"text":"came here for the chili spagetti got it 5 way was really good ! other food looked good waiter was supernice can wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time. Here my son Alex will tell the rest.  Here's the deal.  This is not your grandfathers steak and shake.  I wish it was but its not.  But for the Midwesterner or easterner who remembers what a full service steak and shake is like. At least you will have the memory is your childhood steak burger at you disposal. And that's a good thing.  So I won't be too hard inn this abbreviated concept. After all the manager was nice and the cashier was from saint Louis. And that's a good thing.  Even if the arak burgers didn't come on China and the shakes were not served in real glass."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad just a little over cooked. Nice to see a steak and shake in AZ"}
{"text":"The food was OK. I think smashburger is alot better."}
{"text":"Steak n Shake is awesome!  Great prices... love the milkshakes!  Service is great, and the restaurant is always busy... great place to get a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a bit of a drive but worth it every time!!!!  There chili is amazing! I usually always get the jalapeño crunch burger, YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is always talked about so thought i would give it a try the fries a stringy fries so super small and the sandwiches are small. I would never eat here again. The only thing I can say is the prices r reasonable. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was decent but they really need to clean up their parking lot, trash everywhere. Gives off a bad vibe when you're sitting in the drive thru waiting on your food."}
{"text":"Food okay. Place 1/2 full and it took 10 minutes to be seated,  10 to place an order, and another 10 to get our order!  Milkshake showed 10 minutes after our food was delivered!!  It's not that hard. Looks like there's little to no training of staff or they all have a \"I don't give a sh#t\" attitude."}
{"text":"I believe most of the high ratings on this place are due to folks having fond memories of this place from their childhood in the midwest.  It's really not that good.  But it is pretty affordable (double cheeseburger and fries for $3.99; Shakes for $2.99-$3.49).    It's been open for about 3 months in Vegas - and the line is still 2 hours long on a Friday night?   Really?!?   It's not worth that, we grabbed take out and it took ~15 minutes.    The shakes were especially disappointing - the Shake costs just almost as much as the burger and fries, and they put Shake in the name of the establishment.  So, it should be a higher quality and more tasty shake IMHO..."}
{"text":"Worst Steak and Shake Ever.   I got there and sat at the counter. Nobody acknowledged me.  I sat there waiting at the counter with employees in front of me and not even greeted.  New customers came in and they were acknowledged and even seated.  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Steak and shake? More like fake and shake. This is in no way a steak and shake restaurant. Literally nothing is the same. There are 2 burgers on the menu. This place is now about on par with McDonald's."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm only gonna comment about the service not the food cause I mean, can't expect too much from a chain restaurant.  So, I went there with my roommate late at night to enjoy a late dinner. We waited at the front to get seated . . .  10 mins later, no \"hello\", no \"I'll be with you in a moment\", no getting seated. litlerally standing there getting ignored.  we choose to sit our selves, looked throught the menu, waited another 5 ~ 10 mins, NO ONE to even say \"hi\" or serve us water.  We then, choose to just order to go, so we waited at the front of the register. . .  5 ~10 mins, we make eye contact, but NO ONE to taking our order.  I mean, it was 11pm at night and they weren't busy.  So roommate and I got so upself, we choose to leave. As we were leaving, we passed by a man who went in the store. We see from the window, HE'S GETTING SEATED ASAP!!  What is with this service! Never Every going there again!!"}
{"text":"Service is hit and miss. Food isn't super spectacular. Kinda just somewhere you settle on with a group of friends for a quick bite when nothing else sounds good. The place overall needs a face lift, just feels like a nursing home cafeteria."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and waited over 20 minutes for my food. There was also a car in front of me who was waiting when I arrived so God knows how long they were waiting. Awful service."}
{"text":"Growing up as a kid my dad always talked about a Steak n Shake back home in St. Louis. He said the burgers are great and the beans even better. The chili is thick and hearty and the shakes are like eating it out of the ice cream shop fresh.  I wasn't going to St. Louis anytime soon the try the food....lol.   I was so happy to hear the opened one up in Las Vegas! Not that far of a dive to get to and hey I can always stay in Las Vegas for a bit right! Awesome.  I had high expectations going in....they hit every one of them for me too. I love this place, it's exactly how my dad described it. I like the decor and the simple menu.  The burgers are almost paper thin but yet full of flavor and juicy. The buns are soft and sweet. I love the thin fries and the garlic thing they put on it. The shakes are super thick and fresh.   Every time I go to Las Vegas, it's a must we stop and bring a bunch home as well. Just order them with everything on the side and they reheat just fine!"}
{"text":"I love steak and shake but this one is franchised not a corporate location and things are a bit different, and of course casino locations don't often honor things. This location does not honor free kids meals but does do the half price shakes from 2 to 4.  Today we all went, 13 of us and instead of putting us together they seated us at 3 different tables. One by the door, one about midway and one over on far wall. What the hell? Who seats people like that? Our waiter was nice at first but after taking orders we never saw him again until much much later. Our table of 4 had eaten, all our drinks were empty, our shakes had still not come and the other 2 tables we were with had finished their meals and shakes long before our food or shakes came out. We finally got our waiters attention and he asked if anybody had brought our shakes, ummmm no, they have not. He brought them a few minutes later in to go cups stating they were out of regular glasses but to us the cups looked smaller,  they said they weren't but they appeared to be. I've had the garlic burger at other locations but here they fix it differently. When I've had it it arrives with a glaze on the bun and has the white garlic sauce on it but at the Vegas location it arrived with meat and bun and nothing else. The bun looked nothing like the picture,  there was no sauce or anything. When I inquired I was told this was how they do it at this location and told they have don't put anything on it but they did offer to bring me some garlic mayonnaise. I have no idea why a garlic burger does not come with the garlic mayo on it to begin with, odd that. I'll go back to a regular location but not this one."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my son for a quick lunch and witnessed first hand some of the worst conditions I've ever seen in a restaurant. Dirty floors, counters, & tables. Seriously looked like no one had cleaned in months. Watched a couple get seated and no one every went back to wait on them.  Contacted corporate about the filthy conditions and was told that all areas had been detailed in the past few days and that these areas were clearly overlooked. I was asked to inform a manager the next time so they resolve the matter quickly. Oh o.k. sure. Sorry but I totally disagree with his reply to my complaint. So I'm going to insult the manager on duty by telling them the restaurant is filthy. No. that's not my job. My job as the customer is to stop in, relax and eat in a safe clean establishment. It is the job of the manager or district manager to make sure their staff is producing under Steak 'n. Shake corporate guidelines."}
{"text":"After we left the comic convention and decided to check this place out, and it was awesome. The line was long but was worth it."}
{"text":"Went inside, seated ourselves, no waitress ever came. Other tables were served and the waitress walked past us several times but never stopped. There were 3 other tables so maybe 10 customers. No cars in the drive thru so we left and went through the drive thru where we were served promptly. The food was good and hot. The drive thru worker gave us free drinks and cookies when I told her about our experience inside. I'd definitely go here again but probably only late night as they are open 24 hrs. In the day there are too many better options nearby."}
{"text":"How is it possible that it has taken me this long to review this little slice of Heaven? Who knows? Located in The South Point Hotel Casino. Cheap prices and un-outrageous portions are thre order of the day. If you want a quick bite, and would like the ability to walk afterwards, look no further my friend you have found your place.

SIGN UP ONLINE AND GET A FREE BURGER ON YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!! as well as coupons all the time, I just used one! They have great milkshakes as well. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite places to go for a good burger at a great price. It's great that I live really close to the Southpoint so I'm one happy mofo. I have never even heard of Steak n Shake until it opened up here, but I'm glad I know about it now.  All I have to say is my new favorite burger EVER is the Wisconsin Buttery. I swear, it's like a party in your mouth! I've tried some of their other burgers, which are all really good, but the Wisconsin buttery, to me, Is total awesomeness. I usually get that and a shake. I like cookie dough myself.  Theres usually a line during the times people would go out and eat, but it's not that bad. Well worth it to me. And with the prices of food in pretty much every single casino in vegas being high, the prices of the meals at Steak n Shake are a bargain."}
{"text":"friggin sweet! i am in vegas with the family for my son's BMX race thing.... the competition is in the south point hotel   so..we are newbie's at this whole thing and didn't realize that when you show up to competition...that you are here ALL DAY LONG! now i wish we had gotten a room at this hotel ...ugh..  so kids are hungry and we have to feed them without breaking the bank. The folks behind us in the stands told us about Steak and Shake ...and its in the hotel!   so we headed on over there...there was a line both for a table and to go...(2 separate lines...that's really smart)  we opted to stay...i don't know about you but i think a meal should be consumed at a table NOT off your lap sitting in the bleachers...  Just a note...i am not eating right now or for the near future...so i didn't consume any of the food...so the food taste is based on the opinions (which i trust) of my family. kids each had a single cheeseburger with bacon and fries ($4 each) hubby had a double cheeseburger and fries (also $4)... i had a diet coke....$2...  service was ridiculously fast, ridiculously over the top friendly, and amazing!  food LOOKED AMAZING!!! both hubby and kids LOVED it all!  they said that in a similar burger category, that this killed it!   i liked my diet coke...the guy even brought me one \"to go\", when he brought me a box for my daughters leftovers.  I believe we will return for the kids lunch or dinner today  i wish they had one in San Diego...  only bummer...the kids were cold at the BMX event...i wanted to buy a Steak and Shake sweatshirt...but they are only available online..boo they could have made quite a bit of money off of me if they sold sweatshirts in store!"}
{"text":"Terrible ,terrible , horrible service and we were the only table in the place!  Food was good."}
{"text":"Seriously the yummiest cheapest burgers in Vegas. I got a double cheeseburger and fries for $4! The service was quite good, we only had one server that got a little grumpy but it was like 11 at night so... They should open early for breakfast, they are the only Steak & Shake that don't. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table even with all the NASCAR fans and even when we had 8 people with us. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This Steak n Shake is literally the worst I have ever been to. I am a member of the US Navy and I came here to enjoy what I used to love. I ordered a #18 with two milkshakes, one chocolate and one vanilla. I also asked that the seasoning be put on my burger and fries. When I got my order the two milkshakes were filled below standard. The whipped cream was peaking at the brim of the cup rather than the top of the cap. They also didn't put seasoning on my fries OR burger and when I asked for some they gave me about the amount of a tea spoon. Freaking terrible. Don't go here unless you want extreme disappointment and your image of the place to change negatively."}
{"text":"If I was rating this place by their malts alone I would give them a five. Seriously, their malt is what dreams are made of. They definitely have the best malt I've ever had or will ever have in my life.   My coworkers and I came here for some quick food before bowling. Many people commented that the wait would be long, but at 6:00 on a Tuesday night we didn't have to wait at all. Our food came out ridiculously fast, less than 10 minutes after ordering.   I ordered a single burger with fries and it was the perfect amount of food for me. It was also delicious for a fast burger. The prices here are also laughably low.   This is a solid spot for a burger and shake for cheap."}
{"text":"We went in around 1130 pm. It took along time to even be acknowledged after we sat down. Once our waitress (Olivia) finally brought our food, we never saw her again. My date actually had to the window to get a server. We finally got a refill when we were ready to leave and we're done eating. Well, we went to the register to pay and then had to stand there another 5 minutes. REALLY. Finally the manager came and after we told her about it, she discounted our bill 5 dollars.  Well what a horrible experience and POOR customer service"}
{"text":"I've been here five or 6 times. When it opened I enjoyed the super banana shake, after I came for food a few times I stayed away. The burgers are super dry, the fries are low quality. The dining area was usually dirty, and there was a supervisor with a ridiculous I'll do everything myself attitude, always standing at the grill, and leaving the other workers to work with minimal effectiveness. The shakes are good and some flavor s may be worth grabbing while you're on mill but I don't eat here at all anymore and I work on mill and live a mile away. Go to in n out."}
{"text":"The food looks better in the pictures. And why is everyone so rude here? They must not like their jobs or have poor leadership and terrible pay. Idk"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok.. They need more flavor... Nutella shake is for a limited time and is good!"}
{"text":"Was excited to visit this place since I have only been to a Steak 'n Shake in Orlando and boy did they not disappoint. But from reading the reviews people must have been here at a busy hour. Sure we had to wait a minute or two for a table but the place was packed, no big deal. Our waiter was extremely nice, and was there when we needed her. The place was also very clean which I was surprised since the one I went to before was a bit dingy. Highly recommend any of their burgers since they cook them fresh for you, I especially like their guacamole burger, avocado, red onions, pepperjack cheese and chipotle sauce? Sign me up. Another star just for their crispy thin fries & seasoning they have for them, the seasoning is literally to die for, I don't know how to describe it but it adds a bit of spice to anything. I almost wanted to get some for myself but maybe next time. Alas the closest location is in NY, when will they open one in the northeast?"}
{"text":"Why are the other reviews for this place so bad?!  I had a pretty good experience.    I ordered an eggnog shake and a footlong hotdog to go and it was an easy ordering exerience and my food came out less than 7 minutes after I placed my order.  Eggnog shake was GREAT (was worried about it being too much) and the hotdog was surprisingly good.  (I was sober- it's rare when hot dogs are good sober- unless you're at a baseball game.)   Service was pretty good, food was pretty good.... overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 minutes for our food when ordering Togo for them to get the order wrong, managers are rude and could care less. They remade my food and it was wrong again. I watched people stand there waiting to order and no one even acknowledged them with a \" we'll be right with you\" or anything. Customer service just sucked."}
{"text":"I just go to stock up on chilli - it's the best.  I by the cans by the case."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally try this place. I should have went there with less expectation so I can rate the place with higher reviews.  Luckily we only had to wait 31 min and 31 seconds.  (LOL I actually timed it on my iphone since people were saying we would have to wait an hour)  The place is mighty small- one good reason why there is such a long wait besides the place being new and inviting. Our server Lisa was nice and informative.  I ordered the CHEDDAR CHEESY DOUBLE STEAKBURGER.  $1 more than the regular CHEESE STEAKBURGER.  The only reason it was a dollar more was cuz it was \"WISCONSIN CHEDDAR CHEESE\"--oooooooh!   We also ordered some ONION RINGS which was ok.  (the onion rings at my job's cafeteria is sooo much better)  The ranch sauce was weak and the honey/mustard looked like chipotle with thousand island...anyways. My son's sliders...looked weak but it filled him up and he did like the taste. My mom ordered the MUSHROOM STEAKBURGER and I guess she liked it since she drowned it in the ranch sauce we got with the onion rings. Our coca-colas were yum and came in a coca-cola glass.  I got the CHERRY COKE, son got VANILLA COKE and moms got the DIET COKE.  The fries were as small and skinny as the ones at MC Donalds but not as tasty and kinda crispier.    Of course we had to order some shake to go to make the experience complete. By this time it was shift change and Lisa had to leave us.  (So we made sure she got her tip) The shift change was at 6pm but our next server did not even show up at our table til 6:20pm.  I was feeling bad for the people in line knowing they are starving and waiting for that long-awaited experience to taste the STEAKBURGER. We finally got our shake order in and had to wait another 10 min.  The guy clearing the table was much more friendlier (I think his name is Jerick) he explained to us that they only had two blenders which can only handle 4 shakes at a time.  My shake MINT something was delish and yummy.  My son did not really like his which was STRAWBERRY BANANA.    Now my review on the burger:::::It was juicy and tasted good.  The cheddar cheese....umm..I could have been happy with the regular cheese.  I did not add any salt or anything else so I can actually taste the meat.  It did taste fresh and the double burger probably equaled one thick burger.  The bread was nice but the lettuce was just a flimsy leaf they threw on the burger.  It was not greasy (unlike the Johnny Rockets burgers) and I actually finished my burger without grossing out at the end.  The price is great for a sit-down spot.   My advise to newbies: Try it and check it out on off hours.  If there is a long line....well....your choice.  LOL.  BONUS:  if you spend $15 you get a free COKE GLASS.  We got two free glasses since we spent $31.  (I should have played thosed numbers since we waited 31min 31seconds and the bill was $31dollars.    *****I hope my review was worth your read********"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here after many, many bad experiences at other Steak 'n Shakes. Jessica(we think that was her name) was a great server. Everything was quick and she was always checking on us. For how busy they were, I thought everyone was hustling and doing a good job. The only thing that needed attention was the bathroom but it wasn't worth taking away a star."}
{"text":"have eaten here several times. the portobella mushroom burger is as good as it gets. strawberry shake with fudge on top also excellent. first time we ate here was the second day they opened. long line, 60 minute wait. worth it, and hey, who says you can't visit with the other people in line. food remains consistanly good, service good, one of our regular stops. if you go during happy hour three people can have burgers, fries and shakes for around $20."}
{"text":"Place nice and service was good.  The food was bad.  On level with fast food place and even some of those are better.  The fries might have been the worst ever and the shakes are average at best.  Its cheap so that is why it got one star"}
{"text":"The service is slow but the food is good. I've been here a number of times but this time I was told they no longer have junior sizes for their shakes. So the twins would either have to agree to one flavor and split it or I'd have to buy a full size one for each of them. Well, anyone with kids knows getting them to agree on the same flavor of something is hard. So I ended up buying them a full size each. I'm very dissapointed that they got rid of kid size drinks and there is no kids menu. This place definitely went from family friendly to date night status in my book. Cost for two 7 year old girls and one adult, $37.19."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever had. We came into the restruant and weren't seated for atleast 15 minutes. When we finally got seated we sat for another 20 minutes without even being asked for drinks. We finally got a waitress to come serve us. They didn't have lettuce for a salad and the fries were cold. Very disappointed with my visit."}
{"text":"I still remember my very first Steak N Shake experience a couple years back (ok, it was probably more like a lot of years back).  The concept of shakes and hamburgers was very awesome to me.  Over the years, the chain has gotten bigger and changed somewhat... but they are still going strong.    This location is friendly and is a 24hr location.  Seems like their new promotion is a \"Happy Hour\" for shakes between 2-4pm and 2-4am!!!  It was almost tempting to try and come back a 2am...  but we decided to wise up a bit.  Food portions have fluctuated... so it seems like the portions are down a bit - but it's a good thing so that you don't feel over stuffed when leaving.  (you only have to run about 10 miles to burn all the calories instead of 26.2)."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE. I waited in the drive thru for 30 mins and no one said anything, I didn't even get a be right with you or anything. Like just acknowledge that they know your there. It's rude ! I will go to another one cause this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is a typical Steak n Shake. However the staff did not seem to be jaded by their work and were even pleasant to us-- when we came bouncing in just before closing (midnight).  No red flags to warn you about."}
{"text":"Steak n' shake beats In n' out. Hands down. It gives you that 80's diner vibe. Located right inside the south point casino, the wait isn't too long and the waiters are pretty good. The food is amazing as well as the milkshakes. Hands down my favorite burger joint. Good for groups, couples, families and kids."}
{"text":"I've been to Steak 'n' Shake locations in the south, and was thrilled to learn that they're expanding westward.  I made it a point to visit when I was in town recently.   The good:   With the word \"shake\" in your name, you'd better have a good one.  And they do!  Lots of choices in flavors, even the opportunity to combine flavors for no extra charge.     The not-so-good:  Their food wasn't as solid as other locations I've been to.  It felt and tasted more like fast-food than the fast-casual experience I've had before.    The verdict:   It's worth a stop for their shakes for sure.  Service was average. The burgers aren't the best, but they're definitely A-OK!"}
{"text":"Good ass food. Clean place. We wrre driving out to vegas for the 4th and were hungry and stopped here at south point to get steak n shake. Bomb ass food. Fast service. The waitress brought refills. All in all a good trip. This one the food tasted alot better than the one by my house"}
{"text":"We live nearby, eat here every week, and have always enjoyed the good food served with a smile..  Until yesterday. Our server couldn't understand my order, so brought another server to hear my order.. And then brought the wrong food anyway! We also ordered two milkshakes, which didn't show up at all..  We were tired trying to eat a simple meal, and left angry. Oh, and I left a penny tip. It will be some time before we go back, if ever."}
{"text":"This is the fastest Steak 'n Shake I have ever been to. It had great service and the workers were so nice. The bathroom was very clean, and overall restaurant seemed clean and organized. The food was also great quality."}
{"text":"The food is typical of other Steak and Shakes nothing really to complain about food wise. However service or lack of service is another story. The wait staff is terrible . Basically during our visit they took our order and delivered our food, never to be seen or heard from again. No drink 'refill and had to flag some one down in an attempt to get our bill. The waitresses were constantly bickering with each other and with the manager all in front of customers. While the food is good This is a poorly managed restaurant. Too many choices in the area for me to return to this Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"This place was not off the chain. Pardon the pun, but I wish the CU area had more non chain restaurants like where I grew up in the 'burbs. I love small business...I guess Obama doesn't (STOP TAKIN' MY RIGHTS). I am being facetious of course, but I digress about the POTUS.  Anyway, I arrived on a Friday night just to hang out and chill (hopefully not see any students of mine). There are multiple reasons; I am a PE teacher who usually stays on track with nutrition, students are generally awkward in social settings, and I just wanted to read my MH Magazine.  I went with the single steak burger meal (for under $4), but I substituted the chili (with ONION AND JALAPENO) instead of the fries so it ended up not being one of the featured under $4 meals. I also got a chocolate shake and would have added more (like Butterfinger or Oreo), but I wanted to tip my server pretty well. For under $15, I tipped 30%, got a burger, chili, and some fries.  I hate reviewing chains, but it seems CU only has them. I feel like Steak N' Shake is a bit nostalgic. Went there a ton growing up after dentist appointments in Tinley Park, in high school (one time we stiffed our server; he was awful, but I was just a punk HS kid...one of the biggest regrets of my life...no joke), and on a \"road trip\" with some of my best high school friends on the way to Cincy to watch the White Sox. Steak and Shake and I have shared some memories, but I cannot say they were steak-tacular like some of the local joints in the 'burbs I've been too.   Hahah"}
{"text":"For a place called Steak n' Shake you would think the shakes would be better. The Cajun fries were decent, but not a spot worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Good solid S&S located on the main drag in Gastonia. I've been here multiple times and the experience has always been good. The burgers are great and the shoe string fries are classic. My son always loves to wear the free line-cooks hat and destroys his junior shake within a minute. I don't know why but every time I order a shake at the end of the meal it takes way longer than it should to get it. The other negative is if your coming down from Cox road you have to make a U turn at the light to get to this one. But overall it's a good place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Waited for 30 minutes in the drive through while watching four employees go out and smoke and do whatever else. No one taking orders in a timely manner. Worst steak and shake o have ever been to."}
{"text":"Sadly, my craving for Steak 'n Shake was not satisfied at this location.  The burgers were greasy & not even in a patty shape because of how thinly they had been pressed out.  I love their fries, but they couldn't save this poor meal.    One very nice waitress came to take our drink orders and when she came back with our drinks another old bat waitress came up & basically told the girl she wasn't taking the table.  That was sad, because the old bat waitress was crappy & rude.      At one point the waitress made a lady sitting nearby move her seat so that she could take one half of the table from her to make a whole table for someone else.  This was an issue because she could have taken our half table because we weren't using it...well, then she took our table, but didn't even say anything.  Overall, I'd skip this Steak n' Shake because if that's what you're craving - you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night, as it was the only place that looked good and fast at the Southpoint. I heard about all the hype and never wanted to believe it, but it's all true. The food is amazing. I had the sliders and a shake ,and my partner had a jalapeno burger. We both were super satisfied with our choices. Now, customer service is definitely lacking, and don't even look in the back of the kitchen, or you may never want to eat here again, but the food was totally up to our standards."}
{"text":"We actually had good service, which was a little bit of a surprise given the couple who stormed out and told us they had been there 20 minutes and weren't even greeted. Ashley was attentive and friendly, but they definitely seem to lack a system for greeting people at the door. Food was good. Better than most fast food and good prices."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  The burger was good, service was good.  But it is a good thing I ate before going into the Men's room.  Talk about disgusting!   You know that corner of the building, behind the dumpster, where the homeless guys always urinate?   Well, that corner is less revolting than this restaurant's men's bathroom.  This was the worst, nastiest, most disgustingly unclean restaurant bathroom I have encountered in Charlotte.  And I have lived here for 38 years.  Makes me wonder just how wholesome the food is if the bathroom is so unsatisfactory.  I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"11/25/11  After checking out a movie at AMC and a bit of shopping at Northlake, the rest of the family wanted to grab a bite.  On our way to Friday's, a nephew mentioned Steak 'n Shake, which went over well w/ the adults, since it was cheaper than the original choice of Friday's, and me, since I felt like having something sweet!  The wait was moderate, but it was Black Friday, after all...  Manager asked if we minded getting two tables pulled together, and we said \"no problem.\"  We ended up sitting in two booths, across a foot path and adjacent from each other...  Two of the children ordered a steak burger and chicken fingers, both w/ fries.  Mom had a cup of chili w/ onions and cheese, and I ordered a strawberry milkshake to share.  Kids enjoyed their meals, Mom thought the chili http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=hbKt52iPDQduRiz1huRszQ was mediocre (\"the chili at the Sam Adams bar in that airport was much better!\"), and I thought that the milkshake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was too sweet.  We stopped halfway, and I decided I'd order my original choice of Hershey Special Dark.  This was much better-- not very sweet!  Nice that this also came w/ a few chocolate chips sprinkled on top...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=Jj17ry6dfdmjRpa3eh2Ogg  Had to remind our server of the kids' forgotten mini-shakes.  An order of onion fries arrived that no one ordered-- very cool of the manager to offer it to us, anyway!  (That's how it should be, btw... rather than serving up soggy fries to the intended guest or throwing them away.)  Seems like everyone deemed the meal satisfactory.  Maybe next time I can check out other menu items..."}
{"text":"It's about time that Steak N Shake came to the valley. I LOVE the frisco melt, it's crazy greasy deliciousness. The place is clean and the service is friendly, which to be honest, feels weird when I'm used to a surly waitress giving me the stink eye when I order my food at this chain.    I wish they'd stay open 24 hours like standard Steak N Shakes, but ah well. I don't mind the smaller menu, but I do mind that they do not have the peppers. They are missing some key elements that dispite the smaller menu they could do better.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that the milkshakes are not Steak N Shake quality. However, I'm willing to overlook all of that for my Frisco melt with fries and a side of cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food in drive-thru....it is now 11:37pm. I love Steak N Shake but this place needs to ditch the drive-thru or make some changes. Pull up, park, pull up, park, pull up, order, pull up, park. Call your family. Change the station 3 times. Lean out the window once to see what jerk is ordering for the office or army of rugruts...which is still 5 cars ahead of you. Oh....the trickle of brake lights! Yay. Pull up. Park. Repeat all that same shit but maybe rev the engine once or thrice this round. I thought XM radio was commercial free? What the fuuuuuck did these pricks order?! Wait....I saw an exchange. Still parked. This piece of shit is going to make sure everything is accounted for. While we're still parked. My burger was delicious but I was more exhausted than you are from reading this ramble after trekking that gauntlet they call a drive-thru"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Stopped here because of all the rave and pumped up reviews . Ordered a grilled chicken salad & spent most of my time picking out rotten pieces of ice burg lettuce"}
{"text":"gave me a throwback kind of feeling being in there.  it was nice though.  service was kind of slow because it was very busy.  there is only one Steak 'n Shake in Vegas so there is always a line to get in, but worth it.  id suggest the Royal Burger with any one of their shakes.  good burger and shake place."}
{"text":"Mmmm, chocolate milkshake....I enjoy this chain BUT will NO longer support this location. They have been unresponsive to requests to shovel their sidewalks and create a safety issue. Until they are good community members and neighbors, I just won't go here anymore."}
{"text":"I heard there's usually a long line to get in here, but since we came so late, we were seated in only about five minutes.  I guess this place is popular in other states as I had never heard of it.  My friend said it reminded him of back home when he used to eat there, so we went.  Food is cheap!  Then again, it is fast food.  Shakes are large and filling.  Food itself was not so great.  I got a chopped steak sandwich while he got spaghetti with chili and onions.  Weird combo.  Now that I've eaten here once, I don't think I need to come back.  Most of the people here were also way overweight so I know this stuff can't be good for you."}
{"text":"My family and I had to wait 17 minutes before being asked what we wanted to drink the food was not that great and the milkshakes were watery I strongly don't recommend this location to you yelpers or my family."}
{"text":"Friday night after the Christmas holidays there was a wait to be seated but so worth the wait! I usually can't finish my burger but I was surprised of myself how delicious it was and next thing I knew, burger gone! I had the strawberry banana milkshake that was heaven to my taste buds!"}
{"text":"Comparing this place to McDonalds is a travesty.  I personally don't like feeling like I'm going to die after eating a meal; this place doesn't make me feel that way if I eat their burgers or fries.  The main draws here are the burgers and the milkshakes.  I had a coupon that was close to expiring so I arranged this trip.  Since the one in Winston Salem is lousy, we decided to take our chances with this one.  My sister and her small kids were part of this party and we didn't have any problems getting seated or food.  Service was great for us and no one gave me grief over my coupon or bothered the kids when my sister asked for things for them.  In fact, we showed up during their happy hour discount for drinks & shakes (2-4 p.m. & 2-4 a.m. if you're curious).  We made sure to speak up about that stuff; I'm not sure if they would have taken the happy hour discount off if we'd not mentioned it.  I had a double steakburger & I was surprised that it was not overly filling for me.  I usually get the single burgers.  Very standard fare but the milkshakes are great (though filling).  Not the most spectacular location I've been to & I don't suggest going out of your way for this one but it was decent compared to the one in Winston Salem."}
{"text":"We were looking for something to eat on Christmas Day. Very hungry we stopped in here.   Had the triple burger with heavy pickles and granddaughter had spicy chicken sandwich (too spicy to her) then got something to go for wife the 3 way chili to go. My god it was like a less than kids portion. It was for my wife.   The food while there and the waitress was great.   The service great.   I looked up a former review about the bathroom as well. The guy who wrote about the bathroom was not far from wrong. It needs to be cleaned badly taken care of hourly.   The portion size on their chili to go was seriously small,not worth the money."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious steakburgers and what great prices they have! The regular cheese-steakburgers are two patties and filling. Plus you get a lot of fries with your meal so it really fills you up for $3.99! Can't beat the deal! I just wish we had these in San Diego. Then again, maybe its good that we don't because then I'd be there all the time and gaining a ton of weight from all the delicious burgers lol. Will definitely be back next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Craving burger but also looking for a cheap lunch. Walking down Mill Ave and checked this place out.  Cool, burger and fries for under $5 dollars?  I am in.  A lot of the reviews state his place is dirty but I thought it was clean for a burger place.  Waited in line longer than expected but that was because the lady in front of me.    It took about 10 mins for my food to come out but no big deal, I was on my lunch break.  Food was alright.  Burger was on the greasy side but tasty.  I loved the fries.    Will be back when I have that craving and don't want to drive to the In N Out and wait in line."}
{"text":"It is what it is, a chain! I mean, for mass production of food it does it's job well. Food is edible, even tasty considering what you paid! Ok, can't expect gourmet for $5 right. The milkshakes are tastyyyyy. The place is clean, the people are friendly, it's in a area where food options are limited, and they get the job done. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place was pretty alright. It was slow as hell service and the service seemed a little rushed.   I ordered the $4 classic- double stack burger without onions or mayo. There were about 12 pickles hiding between my steak patty and my toasted bun. That was weird; I like pickles a lot but there comes a time when there are too many goddamn pickles, and that time came. While they didn't give me any onions, there was mayo! Curses! Oh well. I dealt with it. The burger was good otherwise, needed a little ketchup, but easily solved. I was glad I ordered the double because two of those patties with cheese wedged between them was literally the thickness of one burger patty anywhere else. Like I have eaten thicker pickles than those patties! Ah well, it was good nonetheless.  My friend and I also ordered shakes; I got an Oreo one and she got Nutella. They were both good but I think I am outgrowing the sweetness of sugar on sugar on sugar because the shake was pretty meh to me.  The best thing about this place is their fries; they have the little crisp, lightly salted shoestring fries that are the things salty dreams are made of. So that's a plus. I would come here again when I'm drinking or something but I've had better burgers."}
{"text":"The vicissitudes of life haven't been kind to steak and shake.  The service was the underlying problem but the food didn't help.  I asked for a burger with no bun, just some extra lettuce here and there to compensate.  I had to order this four times.  The server didn't think I was serious.  She asked me two times if I was serious.  I kept telling her I was serious.  It was her second day according to the manager.  I don't think it takes experience as a server to not think someone is not ordering what they are ordering.  Does she think everyone hates lettuce and I must be kidding?  I waited for the lettuce, it took a long time.  They don't have full leave, only smaller pieces but not shredded.  Not ideal but close enough.  All the waiting caused the burger to be cold.  I left a tip out of habit, I really thought i wouldn't though.  I used to really like this place, but my last experience was so bad I don't think I will be going back unless someone else suggests it."}
{"text":"Food was good,waitress was awesome, this place slower than slow, 30 minutes to get food, then one person out of 4 didn't get their food with us, had to wait another 20 minutes for shakes."}
{"text":"I was here during opening week. The food was great quality. But the prices were expensive but I considered I was by the strip so I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Just average. Prices are ok, portions are small, and the shakes were waayyy overpriced and not that good. 1 shake is the same price as their double cheeseburger meal. The one highlight is the convenience if you are staying at the South Point or Grandview, but don't go out of your way to come here. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Steak n Shake is usually a good go to. But this time I wish I would have avoided it. Arrived late in the evening and was seated quickly. Once the waitress came to get our drink orders things were fine. After about 15 minutes waiting for out drinks the waitress talks over the wall that hide the drink fountain that she was sorry and was getting. I noticed that someone seated 5 minutes after got there food and drinks before we go ours. I am writing this as I am waiting for my food. So I  will let you know how the rest of the visit goes if anything goes wrong..............   *UPDATE*  So about 5 or 6 minutes after I posted the original post a different waitress then ours walks past us and asked if we have ordered food yet. We said yes and she said she would look into that. A few short minutes later out comes our food. The waitress apologies and we say it's okay just to get on with our meal. Then it hits me. About 5 minutes before I posted the original message I heard from the area the cooks set the food a voice saying \"can you take the onions off that\". My friend that is with me asked for no onions on his burger. I could be wrong but I think our food sat under the heat lamp for 10 minutes or so.   In conclusion I think out waitress was drunk. We could have gotten our food faster if she was not flirting with guys at the front counter. Also I will say it was a tad bit busy, the manager was no wear in sight. Our waitress also made a comment at some point she what was taking so long was because she was looking for a manager. So fast food workers want $15 an hour."}
{"text":"Burger, chili cheese fries and milkshake was terrific. Meals are a great deal and the service was great."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my bro tonight at Steak 'n Shake. This is the second time I've gone to this location and man is it good. When you get a burger, be sure to put the seasoning and ketchup all over the fries which comes with it. The shakes are bomb af too. Cheaper than the shakes that baskin Robbins sells since it's pretty large. I have pictures of the mint Oreo shake and triple steak burger. Service was also great."}
{"text":"Great prices but not so great food. I had the single steak burger with cheese. The burger was meh quality, nothing special but the portion of fries was large so worth the money."}
{"text":"The food is good and its CHEAP.  I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.  $4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded.   Service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.  They also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.  Try the shakes, they're great."}
{"text":"Its on the east side of Mill, the map shows the west side. And, they don't have their mustard relish here  Other than that, tasty burger n fries!"}
{"text":"Average burgers! Cheap prices! Went today and it was happy hour so half price shakes and fries. Had the chocolate covered strawberry shake. Tasted amazing. Every time we come we're never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Please please please get the chili Mac. My heart literally broke when I went in and saw you didn't have it on the menu :("}
{"text":"Think of a cliche that describes poor service. Now soperimpose over that image the steak and shake logo. I walked out of an empty Steak and Shake before ordering. It took 12 minutes to be seated in an empty retaurant. I don't want them to close, though, tbh, I wouldn't wish those seevers on other managers. Steer clear of this one. It's one star because I can't set it to 0."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is awful. We never go to the drive through because we know we'll be in there for atleast 25 minutes. One day we were the only cars in line and we sat at the window for 10 minutes just to pay, then another 15 to wait for our shakes. When we got them they were warm, melted, & one had a huge hole in the cup. When we took it in instead of the manager making us a new one, he poured it into a different cup. Awful. Needs better staff and management. There are a few really good waitresses when you dine in."}
{"text":"This place probably isn't a good idea if you have dietary restrictions or allergies, which was a surprise to me since all the other restaurants in south point are great about handling them! I asked the manager if a plain hot dog with plain fries would be ok for me since I can't have dairy, and she confirmed it was with the ingredient book and also told me she would clean the grill and cook my hot dog on that part. I still ended up getting sick before I even got home, so obviously the grill wasn't cleaned very well. I thought the food was just average, so most likely I won't be back. Customer service was good though, and there is a pokestop you can reach just outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake never disappoints! The burgers, fries, and milkshakes were delicious as usual. And for the ridiculously good price it is, it's worth it. We came in as a group of 10 and surprisingly got the big table right away which is nice because there's only one and it can get pretty busy. If it wasn't so far, I would eat here more often."}
{"text":"The drive thru was so terrible that after 30 minutes of waiting for our food, we went in and were told that our order was never put in, even though there were many people working and the inside of the restaurant was nearly empty. We were not offered a refund either, and were told to wait even longer for them to make our food."}
{"text":"Seems like every time i dine here, the wait for our order to come out takes FOREVER. We waited like 15 minutes for our server to come over to take our drink order, and then when we finally put in our food order, it took another HALF HOUR to get our food! Uhh. I don't come here often, but for some reason, when I do come back, the service is horrible. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Steak n shake! I used to work at the one on South Blvd, so we frequently eat here alot. The biggest complaint I have though is the customer service.  Especially at night, everyone is rude. We don't go in and dine at night anymore, but instead just use the drive thru. Even though they don't do so well in the customer service department, I recommend going back just for the sake of their good food. They actually cook all their food fresh, instead of McDonald's for example. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First of I have to say that I like the food at Steak and Shake, but the service is just terrible! I don't care about waiting in line to get in... it happens there and should be expected if you go. What I'm talking about is getting your drinks and knowing that once the food is there good luck getting a refill on your drink! Im also talking about it having to wait almost 20 minutes in line to pay because the manager can't be bothered to come up and help so we are sent off into the take out line only to wait again and when the manager finally comes up to clear the line all she says is \"it happens\". I then asked for a corp customer she replies \"it only going to come to me anyway\". Seriously, if thats the way you want to treat people I wont be back. Its a shame because the food was good!"}
{"text":"I can over look cold fries, what was really disturbing is that the catsup is in a black meal tray on the counter with about 6 packets. When I asked the guy behind the counter pointed at it and said... isn't it right there? My bad, I thought it was a customer's tray that was returned to the counter. Then I was off to find napkins... you guessed it, they are in a black meal tray next to the drink machine. Half wet, not staked nicely and totally gross looking. I didn't bother to ask this time as I already knew. You would think that ownership would spring for a proper catsup and napkins holders... I'm not even gonna start on the trash cans. (Can't fit and dump the contents of your tray in them) The manager did ask and offer a refund. I declined, it's not his fault that ownership couldn't see their way to spend $100 and at least buy a couple napkin dispensers. Maybe my $13 will can help facilitate that purchase... haha. I guess I'm glad Freddie's, In N Out and Chick Fil A are down the street. Cleaner, friendlier and a better over all experience."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've ever had but not the worst either. The Frisco I believe it's called was pretty good. Sourdough bread meat cheese pickle and some kind of thousand islands sauce. And my Heath shake was sooo damn good. The only thing that was horrible was the tap water .  I could go for another shake now service was great and prompt. The only thing I didn't care for was the chilli cheese fries the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Wife & I stopped in to get a quick bite 8/18/17 there's nothing quick about our visit, although we didnt washout long to be seated but did wait for about 20 minutes to get drink orders, wife had coke & I had water, shouldn't have taken them another 15 minutes to bring out our order it want like we had ordered milkshakes. Note that it wasn't that busy, there were 2 other tables that were already seated & eating & another server waiting on them.       So another table was seated 10 minutes after us, quickly had there drink order placed & ready to order their meal,  I mentioned how we were still waiting to order our meal to my wife, server overheard & quickly took our order wife had thee B.L.T & fries I had the original double cheeseburger & fries, once placed it was a long wait to bring out, the table who was seated after us got their food before us, did mention to manager & didn't offer any discount which by that time we didnt care we were ready to go.       My wife was real impressed on how delicious it was, mines well it's hard to mess up a classic cheeseburger & fries, it's true about service here..."}
{"text":"Midwesterners beware. Not a full service Steak n Shake. Only steak burgers and dogs. You can get the chili but no baked beans, cottage cheese, soup, salad, coleslaw. No china plates. Have to buy the pepper sauce. No table service. Definitely a WORK-aurant. In fairness to staff and quality. The food was very good. Fries were a little over but that happens. The staff were attentive and nice"}
{"text":"We heard so many good stories about SNS. We tried to go opening week and the line across the casino. We decided a date night on thursday. When we got there, no line. I ordered western BBQ bacon steakburger, bacon cheese fries and a cherry limeade. The wifee ordered a portobello n swiss burger, chili cheese fries and a cherry limeade. All were very, very delicious and affordable! We will be back at least once a week to try something new! Thanks SNS"}
{"text":"When driving to Las Vegas from California, the first Casino you'll see is The South Point. It's on Las Vegas Blvd, so technically it's \"on The Strip,\" but it's really a couple miles before the actual famous drag begins (I'd say it starts at Mandalay Bay, but I'm not sure that's an official designation). Anyway, a couple years back I was driving into the city and saw The South Point looming, then noticed a big sign for a Steak 'n Shake in the casino... and let out an audible yelp of joy, which my friends proceeded to ridicule (as they should have). But my excitement came from memories of enjoying Steakburgers any Fries on my last trip to the midwest, where SnS locations are commonplace.  We spent the weekend of the Super Bowl in town, and decided to grab Steak 'n Shake on our way out of Sin City. I ordered my Double Bacon Steakburer, Fries with a side of Cheese dipping sauce, and a Strawberry Shake, posted up at a seat, and watched the fourth quarter as The Packers squeaked by The Steelers and validated Aaron Rodgers' incredible talents. Did the food live up to my expectations and memories? I can't say they quite did... it had been the first time I'd had Steak 'n Shake in six years, and memories of the place were probably overly-romanticized (plus I was pretty drunk when I ate the stuff in Indiana in 05, so that might have contributed). That said, this is a pretty delicious fast food joint with its own style burger, one that doesn't stand up when compared to the fresh deliciousness of In N Out or Shake Shake, but still a very delicious (and very midwestern) juicy disgusting greasy fast food experience. Plus, the fact that the place was at The South Point gave us the opportunity to get on the road ahead of everyone else after the game ended.   I'm just glad that there is a Steak 'n Shake within a four hour drive in my life. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up back at The South Point for another round on my next Las Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"Most incompetent workers ever!! These people messed up my order and then couldn't even fix it.  The manager never came to fix things as well. He never even told me my total before he took my card and swiped it.  When I asked him what was my total he just looked at me and handed me the receipt and my card.  I will never come to this location again nor recommend this type of service to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 3AM (6/10) and they told me the drivethru was closed. Another time I came here was a couple of weeks ago (5/19) and they told me he dining was closed.  I don't know what's up with this steak and shake.  How can you state that your store is 24/7 and not be open 24/7."}
{"text":"Ah good ole Steak n Shake  I remember back in St. Louis in undergrad we used to eat at Steak n Shake a lot on the weekends for a late-night greasy food fix.  Open 24 hours, and the food's still as greasy, still as good as it used to be.  Great shakes too.  They now have a special white chocolate shake and an egg nog shake for the holidays.  Oh so tasty.  I do miss the Steak n Shake in St. Louis though.  There's nothing quite like being served by a surly 40ish woman named Puddin' at midnight when you're hungry and also craving a shake."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty, with fresh ingredients. The shakes here are decent, and a good deal for the price. The atmosphere though... well... that's another story. I've been to several Steak 'n Shakes in the Midwest, and this one is more like a \"Steak 'n Shake Express.\" I guess that's what makes this \"Steak 'n Shake Signature\" restaurant different, but in ways that make me miss the original versions of the chain. This isn't a diner- it's more like eating at an In N Out or a Fatburger. There's just a small seating area, you order and pick up at the counter, and it is not open 24/7. The menu is very limited as well, with less to offer than the diner versions.  The general feel of the place is more modern, and more hip. Top 40 music plays on the speakers, the interior and even the font signage out front has a contemporary feel. They even have one of the new Coke soda fountains that allow you to pick various flavor combinations. Back when I used to live in the Midwest, I had many memories of having late night eats at various Steak 'n Shakes with friends, indulging in greasy burgers and fries on white plates, and lusciously thick shakes in glass milkshake cups. Eating at this Steak 'n Shake makes me long for the actual diner, although the food itself still tastes the same. For me, some of that magic is lost for this particular restaurant when I am eating in a small area with a large crowd of people, getting my order at the counter, and eating my burger, fries, and shake in a fast-food type manner.  We went here on a Sunday around noon. We got in before the big rush, since a few minutes after we ordered, there was a line out the door, winding around the block! Our order took maybe 10-15 minutes to be made, and seating was limited.   I ordered the Royale, partially because it conjured images of Samuel L. Jackson talking about a Royale with Cheese in Pulp Fiction, and partially because the addition of bacon and egg to a burger sounded delicious. The order came with fries, and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious, with juicy, flavorful ground beef, fresh tomato, crisp lettuce (Green leaf, not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!), melted cheese, a smoky salty flavor from the bacon, and a nice rich, creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream, but at $3, hey what do I expect?  The fries were thin, and slightly crispy. They were decent, but the real star of the meal was the burger.   I will be waiting the day that perhaps a full service Steak 'n Shake can open in the Phoenix area. Until then, this express version will have to do!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat at steak and shake because we like the other steak and shakes around the country this particular steak and shake was mediocre at best the cherry Coke wasn't working they had no extra condiments or onion rings very limited menu and the service was subpar next time were in Arizona we probably will not be care but we still love the hamburgers."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude. Rolled her eyes at us. Kept looking down at us and service was slow. Her attitude was horrid. Do not go. The manager was no help."}
{"text":"I don't understand how any burger, anywhere could take as long as this steak and shake does to make a flat burger and some French fries. I understand it's made to order but this location is so slow I could literally go down the street to burgatory, get seated and finish my meal in the time it takes them to get you through the drive through. They are extremely lucky they are the only one in the area because they would get no business if there was another with a 15 mile radius of this time suck.    Update: Waited a half hour for a simple burger and my order was wrong and the fries were cold and half filled. I will never come to this location again. I was promised a refund due to the service I received (or lack there of) and it was never issued. Please save your time and money and eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"We LOVE Steak 'n Shake and were so excited when we happened upon one while in Las Vegas.  We seriously didn't think they existed in the west! My husband loves the Frisco Burger, I always get the single patty cheeseburger.  I love that they are comp[lately made to order so you can get them with whatever toppings you would like.  Their milk shakes are out of this world.  My husband is a real milk shake lover and thinks these are the best around.  I have never had a bad milk shake here. The only downside is that you have to walk through a smoky casino to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I came and I conquered...& left there wondering how they could be compared to In-N-Out? Perhaps the design of the restaurant...? Maybe the price point, which I'll credit..Prices are fair and reasonable here.  I wanted to \"oooh and ahhhh\" over this place like so many do..but the burger was middle of the road. The shakes looked incredible! I might be inclined to try one, one of these days.  The service was friendly, but there was nothing special about the single bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions, that I had. The flavor was very bland.  The wait (lots of hype surrounds this restaurant)  just didn't justify the quality of food that was received. I don't eat fries anymore, but my husband said they were good. He ate mine and his. (The burger automatically comes with fries) I think it would be fair to compare Steak and Shake to Sonic, which I'm not a fan of their food either...  I do see why families come here in drones though...it's kid friendly, low priced food..while on vacation.. I can't blame them.  C'est la vie...Another boring burger bites the dust."}
{"text":"Honestly, Steak 'n Shake isn't amazing. Sometimes we fall in love with an idea. Or a memory. SnS is a perfect example of this. Some people grew up with it in the Midwest and miss it. I've only had SnS a couple of times. But that first time, it was late, I was a little drunk, I had never heard of SnS before, and I thought it was the greatest sandwich I had ever eaten.  Fast forward to today. Based on that one memory, I had been anticipating SnS's opening for several months. I went on \"opening day\" (based on the press release anyway) and endured the 30-minute line. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. I mean, how could it? I still think the best items at SnS are pretty damn good. There are also items that are pretty meh (I experienced this blahness the second time I ate SnS).  On this visit, I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn Melt w/ Fries. For the heck of it, I decided to add one of their Steakburger shooters w/ Chipotle sauce. And of course, I had to get a shake. I went with a Banocolate - a combination of banana and chocolate.  The melt was very good. It was the kind of sandwich that reminded me of that first mythical time eating SnS. The shooter was an example of meh. Not ordering one of those again. As for the shake, just like its flavors, I'm a little mixed on it. For me, the novelty of the half and half shake has worn off. The banana strangely overpowered the neighboring chocolate. Next time, I think I'll get a straight malt. Speaking of which, my cousin got a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt. I tried it. It was good. But I was a little disappointed in its lack of \"maltiness.\"  By the way, our server, Luciane, was attentive and very friendly. This is to be expected on opening day. She was perhaps a little too attentive. She kept asking how everything was before we had even tried.  If you're not a die hard SnS fan, you might want to wait a couple of weeks for the lines to die down. Bottom line: I'm still a fan and I'm glad they're here."}
{"text":"wow, the mint oreo milkshake, the apple/cranberry salad, and the chili mac blew my mind. My boyfriend and I shared all three and it was the perfect amount of food. I wish there was a steak n' shake in California!!  Our server was extremely helpful and prompt. We were in and out within 45 minutes, and it did not take long for the food to come."}
{"text":"We were just cruising up 93N when BAM, there was a sign that said \"Steak n Shake South Point\".  I started screaming in the car, and nearly landed us in the ditch.    Why you may ask?  Well, I've been dreaming of their Frisco melts since I moved from Indiana to Arizona FOUR YEARS AGO!  I've begged my sister and dad to freeze one and FedEx it to me, but no!  And why have I been dreaming of them, well there is no Steak n Shake in AZ (BOOOOO!), and I've been eating there in Indiana since I was a teenager.  Good times!!  This was our first stop when we arrived in Vegas for the Spring Break Yelp Party.   It is located in a Casino/Hotel the South Point.  It opened in December, and if I knew back in January when I went, I would have gone then too.  Yes, I got my Frisco Melt, cheese fries, and chili with a dark chocolate shake.  Service was fast and friendly during a crazy busy lunch hour.  The Frisco Melt was what I had been dreaming about.  They did lack on the toppings like lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  I had to ask for them.  Me no likey!!  The fries were not that fresh and I think I got the bottom bash of them instead of the fresh ones.  Me no likey that either.  The chili was wonderful as usual and I always add my ketchup to it.  Try it!  And the dark chocolate shake was mmmm good.  My husband got the second fav burger of mine, the mushroom swiss.  He said it was really good.  He mentioned my hype on this place was correct.  :)  That's right!  West coast people do not know what they are missing!  Okay, so for next time I'm in Vegas, Steak n Shake is on my list, first thing, so please give your customers fresh french fries and toppings for the burgers.  Thank you to the waiter who had to listen to my childhood story for an hour.  LOL"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says...this is not a fast food restaurant. Yes, they have a drivethrough. But i have never gotten through the drivethrough in under 20 minutes.  So, it's more of a sit-down restaurant that enjoys pissing people off in their cars. I think it's a hobby of theirs.  Order on their app and go in to pick up or plan to enjoy your cheap food experience inside.  They get the two stars for their shakes.  And I just saw that they have an egg nog milkshake. They may get another star if that pans out."}
{"text":"Their burgers are really good, but the shakes are what keep me coming back. Going to be hard to find other milkshakes that rival these"}
{"text":"Man , oh, man is this place delicious! The atmosphere is perfect as well! I absolutely love the white and red walls and seating! The burgers taste fresh and amazing as well as the shakes being out of this world! You must eat here!"}
{"text":"I was out and about and figured I eat the way the college kids do, so I headed down Mill. I had seen Jimmy Johns and Five Guys (which I never tried) across the street. Just before crossing the street I looked behind me to see 'Steak N Shake' and after hearing my out of state friends rave about it I jumped at the chance. Ill admit feeling like that awkward newbie I liked the limited menu but do wish the staff was a bit more ready for an idiot like me who has no idea, I mean its not McDonald's and didn't have any idea what was on the menu till I was staring the cashier in the face. So I order the item with the biggest picture on the menu with a large drink, turns out all drinks are one size, small. She takes my money then hands me my change (price was reasonable) along with my tiny cup and one those vibrating coaster deals. I sit down and finish my drink right away, I ended up refilling it three times before my order was ready, it was 117 outside, I also have to say the seating arrangement is very awkward for a loner but I was there for food. I liked the fries even if I wished there was more, the \"original\" was decent, bun was soggy but did have crisp veggies so I appreciated that. I ate there yesterday and didn't find out till now all the menu items they were lacking from a standard Steak N Shake. Knowing what I know now I should continued across the street to Jimmy Johns or Five Guys, hell if given the option id rather have had a double double or even a Big Mac. I don't have the option to get out very often and even less opportunity to experiment but this time id say I made the wrong choice :("}
{"text":"My family's favorite burger place in vegas. Been going here since 2013. We always make sure to go here at least once when we're in vegas. Pretty bummed that the prices went up though. I always order a single steakburger and a strawberry banana shake. Makes my tummy happy."}
{"text":"Forgot to write this review. Although I never had a chance to eat there. After walking past the line of people waiting for a table, I tried to get a to go order.   What a night mare? Waited 10 minutes and no one to help. I walked around t see what people were eating, (i do that alot, gives me an idea of what to order and to see if people look happy with their food). While walking around, I could not get past how gross and filthy the store was. Looked like a food fight broke out and no one cleaned up. Even worse, some of the food under the tables looked like it had been there a while.  I walked out, headed down to IN N OUT and once again, had an OUTSTANDING burger.   On the way, I called the Steak n shake customer service line that was on the managers card. The lady that answered the phone took my info, said something that sounded like thank you and hung up.   Not only was this place gross and dirty and had horrible service, they did not seem to even care."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is one of my favorite fast food restaurants so the rating is not representing the food.  The service at this particular location is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  I know from experience that the drive thru line is always lengthy and I was prepared for that.  However, after waiting 25 minutes (at least) for my combo #1, I finally pull up to receive attitude from John at the window. He wouldn't listen to anything I was saying and kept responding with \"have a good night\" to move me along.  When I asked for more ketchup he smartly ended up handing me probably the rest of their inventory which was a bit unnecessary and forgot my drink! He gave me attitude, yet again when  i asked for the drink that I ordered, and paid for.  It's a shame they have people like John working the window who ruin the entire experience."}
{"text":"Just left the drive thru they messed up my entire order they literally gave me a burger and bun no cheese or condiments I had gotten a meal, maybe if the lady at the drive thru window wasn't on the phone while taking my order it would have been correct. This instance has occurred multiple times for me at this location I will no longer be going here if I could give less stars if I would"}
{"text":"For the price this was a good find in the South Point Hotel of Vegas.  Especially when you don't want to blow all your money the first day of getting into town. The server was nice and we received our food really quick.  I love love loved their thin cut fries! They were perfectly cooked too. We switched our fries from regular to parm & Herb. They were very tasteful, although I could have done with a little less salt. I ordered a patty melt sandwich and my bf some kind of cheeseburger. The pattys were so tender, juicy and flavorful. My patty melt sandwich was delicious and my bf enjoyed his cheeseburger and a mint chocolate chip milkshake. The best part was we were in and out quickly to get to our activities, and how much we paid. For the 2 entrees, milkshake, and a number of add ons like the flavored fries and bacon we didn't pay more the 26 I believe.  This is definitely a good stop if you are staying in the hotel and are on a budget."}
{"text":"We went back and they have worked out the kinks that I wasn't happy with in my last review. This one is on par with the ones in the Midwest and is a great place to grab a bite when you're at the south point. My favorite is the Frisco melt and the banana chocolate side-by-side shake. This place is always busy but their walk up window is fast."}
{"text":"Best steak burger on the planet, you won't have a better tasting burger anywhere, they need to expand to every state soon, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I go to get a burger at their take out counter. I wait and wait and after waiting 10 minutes, finally the hostess comes over and I ask her if I'll be able to get my food within 6-7 minutes and she laughs and says no.  So I ask for the manager he tells me some excuse that they are slammed and there should be 2 people there. One person there would have been enough! It's Saturday night and especially after a fight just happened at MGM. Staff your restaurant properly for the day of the week and time of day.   Alas, I cannot properly tell you if their food is any good.   This was my first visit to \"I didn't get a Steak N' Shake\". It will be my last."}
{"text":"Good for a quick, cheap bite. Bad for the quality of service and the food. Servers are not very attentive, nor very nice. Food always takes forever, and when you do get the food its bland and dry. Tastes almost like its been sitting on the grill for too long. Sometimes the shakes are good, othertimes i can taste little ice crystals in the shake, as if the ice cream has freezer burn. Overall, not my first choice."}
{"text":"Great for a cheap breakfast. Kids eat free on weekends, and the service while a little slow when busy, is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I am born and raised in St. Louis and grew up on Steak 'n shake. It has always been a bummer than Phoenix doesn't not have one. Had to order all of my favorites. Chili mac, chocolate shake, bowl of chili, cheese fries, and shared a burger with my son (yes, my ride home was miserable, but I was a happy girl). Good stuff!!!   Thank you for coming to Vegas. Your location in Tempe does not have a full menu."}
{"text":"Don't go. Had to wait to be seated and when I was, I was told oh you can just sit over there; never taken to the table.  After a minute finally given a menu. A few minutes later Brandy, the waitress, walked by and said I'll be with you in a minute. Almost 5 minutes later she comes back. I  give her my order. When I finally get my food, my burger had onions on it when I requested it did not. So I get to wait again.  This time when my food returns I am given regular fries when I ordered speciality fries. I sit there waiting for her to return and the people at the next table tell the waitress she needs to come see what's wrong.  I told her I wasn't going to eat the fries since they can't get the order right but I would like to have some napkins for my burger. She returns with about 50 napkins.  The manager now is aware of the situation and asks me about my experience. He tries to make things right and he said dinner was on him. It's sad that it had to come to that. They definitely need help. Job opportunity."}
{"text":"As I've read in other reviews, this location is extremely slow and the service is terrible. We must've been an inconvenience that day. The 4 of us went here for lunch. We waited 40 minutes for 3 burgers and 1 chicken finger. They got our order wrong and forgot our silverware. However, our milkshakes were fantastic.   There was another couple the received cold food and waited an 30 minutes for it (they must've forgotten about them). They were less than happy and stormed out. When paying my check, the manager asked us how everything was; I told her that it was not great and she continued to tell us about the couple that left. Saying that the gentleman \"handled the situation poorly\". When is it ok to talk about other customers? This upset me a little.  We left there with $10 off our bill and gift certificates...I guess I'll go back"}
{"text":"Pepper sauce is the shit and the burgers and fries are always something to look forward to! The shakes are fantastic...too bad there's only one in Vegas..."}
{"text":"The burgers are thin and the fries are too skinny for my liking. The food was hot when we got it but based on the thickness of the items I wasn't full and had to eat another small item to fulfill the meal. I never had the shakes here and I might try one of those next."}
{"text":"I've always liked the burgers here. Great price and great food. Burgers are fresh and tastes amazing. Only problem is the chili cheese fries. Although it sounds really good and tempting. Don't get it!!!! It's pretty much their fries with canned chili and canned cheese. It ruins the fries"}
{"text":"Only reason why it's a 4 stars because of the bacon cheese steak burger my option tastes better than in n out burger. Great prices. I order chili cheese fries and didn't enjoy them not enough cheese I will come again and try the onion rings instead I love the burger, Cons : our waitress never came to check on us, a lot of tables were empty and a full line of hungry people maybe they should have more employees to run things better. I also order a milk shake n love it :)"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and food from S'n'S. The line wasn't too terribly bad when we got there, but I know how long it can get! We went to celebrate my birthday and the waiter, although not the most attentive or friendly, was kind enough to bring me a specialized birthday treat.  It was four of us, two people got dessert and we all had entree's and our tab was $30. I am not sure what kind of voodoo that is for Las Vegas, but I will take it!  Considering the food was good and the price was right, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Steak & Shake always sounds so good - I mean they have meals under $4 and everything. I do love their fries too. But with Freddy's opening just across the street, I think it's safe to say that whatever we had is finally over - even those fries (or the promise of cheap meals) aren't enough to pull me in any longer.  While they will typically seat you at your table somewhat quickly, the service slows down to a snails pace after that. Getting a menu? Slow. Giving the server your order? Slow. Getting the order? Slow. Getting your ticket? Slow. Paying for your meal? Slow. It takes forever, and each step along the way is like a visit to the dentist."}
{"text":"I still don't get Steak and Shake - I keep going because my wife likes the place.  They now have several combo meals on their $4 menu, and guess what - they all come with fries.  That stinks, because it gets me all anxious about having to pick up the little toothpicks.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm all over meal specials, but for $4, I can walk across the street (taking my life in my hands) and get four McDoubles for the same price.  Or maybe three McDoubles and an order of fries.  I think I'd be pretty full.  At Steak and Shake, I ordered the double cheeseburger and fries, and I was left hungry.  Really hungry.  I mean I wouldn't starve or anything but it really left a hole in my stomach.  Not a literal hole like an ulcer or anything, but it just didn't fill me up by a longshot.  Maybe I need to go on a diet before I go to Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the floor being FILTHY, I would give this place 5 stars. Good food, great service, extremely reasonable pricing. I've paid more for less at Starbucks. Get the shooter burgers and seasoned fries, they're a delight, and there's a veritable plethora of milkshake flavors to choose from, and they're all yummy. But, yeah, the floor was pretty gross, and not just in a they-were-busy-today kind of way, more like a you-need-to-steam-clean-that sh*t, yo. Too much funk build up."}
{"text":"We came in and was quickly greeted. The menu was that of a normal burger place. It was pretty busy that day. The lady that sat us was very hospitable. We ordered burgers and chicken tenders, I'm a weirdo I usually order hot tea and I did this day too.. after placing our order and receiving the food, we really weren't checked back on. So I didn't get anymore drink refills for my table. ( we only had the initial drinks we started with ) The burgers were ok. Location is at South Point,  so there is ample parking, close to freeways ect."}
{"text":"Waited long for service, but its okay I understand since it was busy, but no apology?! That, im very disappointed. Especially the fact that the guy was behind, where I could clearly see him, by the kitchen talking to BOTH the manager and the hostess. During our meal? NOT A SINGLE SMILE! wouldnt come back here. Word of advice: go to johnny rockets. Same food,  much better service & nicer staff."}
{"text":"Still debating what was worse, the botched drive thru order or the rudeness of the drive thru staff displayed this evening.  Ordered two hamburgers, two cheeseburgers and one BLT with four milkshakes.  Instead handed out a bag that was missing one of the sandwiches.  After much debate they realized it was the hamburger missing.  With no apologies for the error the attitude instead kicked in with a slam of the drive thru window.  Seconds later a bag was handed out and the person in a very snarky voice said \"have a good night\" and shut the window.  Um, excuse me, we need our milkshakes please.  Once again the window opens asking us what we needed.  Again we restated that our milkshakes were missing.  She walks away, gets the four shakes and as I ask if I can have a drink holder she smiles and says \"sorry we ran out of them\" and. Loses the window.  Needless to say I won't be back.  Oh, by the way,got home and I ended up with three cheese  burgers and one plain hamburger.  As for the BLT, they didn't even toast the bread!"}
{"text":"Just No! Don't come here the meat on our burgers was so thin we could see thru it. I got the Royale burger which has an egg on it  and my egg was so over done it was crispy in a bad way, so I asked them if I could get an over medium/easy egg and the waitress said they can't make the egg Raw at all for whatever reason...I've never had restaurant say that so ridiculous...She also brought us garlic Mayo after specifically asking for regular mayo the food wasn't pretty at all gladly the place is super cheap but the food was beyond disappointing. I will not be returning. Save yourself the time and stomach ache from greasy over cooked food."}
{"text":"So after 2 years things are even worse!  My food was a dried out piece of cold asphalt with cold dried out fries which I did not order and asked for NO FRIES!Clearly this was for another customer who also refused this total plate of crap.  On the positive I did get another burger which was warm not hot.  The cheese was not even melted.  My friends ordered shakes which we were almost ready to go by the time they came.  This place is horrible.  Meatheads is the best burger in CU."}
{"text":"I hail from Illinois and was excited to see this joint pop up on Mill Ave! It's definitely different than the traditional Steak 'N Shakes I've been to in the Midwest but it's better than nothing! I stopped in for a chocolate shake & cheese fries (my fav since I was about 5 years old!). Chocolate shake was super good! Cheese fries were too. Only complaint was the fries were LOADED with salt. My tongue hurts still. But they were hot and fresh! Next time I'll just ask for a fresh batch with light salt :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place opened in the South Point around 2009-2010. I can truly say it's one of the best burger joints in Vegas. They have a spicy chicken sandwich that is one of the best in town. Fries are also great, love the 50s music that plays over the speakers and they have a great dessert menu as well.  The reason this is a 4-star review, and not a 5-star review is because, lately, they keep messing up my order. Every time I go to S&S, I order the exact same thing. Basically, I get a spicy chicken sandwich, no mayo, no pickles, and extra hot sauce. I can't tell you how many times that they leave the mayo in the hamburger or they forget to take the pickles out. It's pretty frustrating.  I'll keep coming back, but I hope they fix their service ASAP, because I do really like this place. And that chicken sandwich, like I said, is fantastic... when it comes out correct, of course."}
{"text":"Was having a crappy day and decided to go on a date here! Have been here a bunch of times in the past and always had wonderful and friendly service. The people during the happy hour shift that day were so kind and understanding, got our food out to us quickly, which was awesome because we were starving, and made sure to keep our beverages filled. The food was excellent as always, and our waitress was so sweet! I wish I knew her name to personally thank her, but after our meal I made sure we tipped her well. Walking into this place feels like you're being welcomed into a family gathering almost, the way everyone is so genuine and kind. We got 3 orders of their chicken tenders and fries which were incredibly yummy, my boyfriend got a cookies and cream milkshake, and I ordered a hot fudge sundae to make my day better, and it sure did the trick! Totally recommend this location and restaurant to anyone who wants to make their day a lot brighter!"}
{"text":"Service here is not the best unless you are coming in at 2 am. Servers do not have etiquette and shout across the room, acting amuck."}
{"text":"You have to stop asking single people \"just you?\" Waiting to be seated... just you? Yep, it's just me... Yep, that booth is fine. Then waitress stops by \"just you?\" Yep, it's still just me."}
{"text":"I have given this location way too many chances and they always disappoint me. The drive thru takes absolutely forever even if you're the next person in line. Having changes such as \"no whipped cream\" are made correctly about 50% of the time. Multiple times I've pulled up to the window and workers are gabbing and laughing. Of course people should have fun at work, I support that, but you need to pay attention to what you're doing. Messing up orders repeatedly and making customers wait 10 minutes for a milkshake is nuts."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place stays open. I've been here a couple of times. The service is slooooow. They bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it, put your Bill on the table and never come back to check on you. If the place was packed I could understand but it's usually about half full. On our last visit it took us 10 minutes to get our waitresses attention. We asked for some mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes for our burgers. It took 5 minutes to get the mustard and mayo. The lettuce and tomato never came.  It's safe to say that we won't be back. We like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service."}
{"text":"I love their cheap prices and tasty burgers!! I mean 3.45 for a hamburger and fries is CHEAP, and if you add cheese it's just 50 cents more so under 4 bucks for a meal! Thats a superb deal in the city of Las Vegas.    The handscooped shakes are very very good. We had the stawberry banana blended and the cookie dough. It had a ton of whip cream on top with a cherry of course. ;)  The service here is a little weak though. It's very inconsisent but i believe it's because they are understaffed! It took a really long time to get drinks and our orders were a little mixed up.   Overall it's definitly a place to try and it's great that it isn't located directly  on the strip. It's like our coming home from Vegas destination."}
{"text":"Gotta love Friday nights at the Southpoint. I was enjoying the cheap $2 drinks with some girlfriends when we decided to hit this place up..2 of my friends had never eaten here before so it was a treat for them. For some insane reason we all ordered shakes with our burgers...not a great idea after many dirty Grey Goose martinis..LOL They were yummy tho as were the burgers and fries.. My friends cant wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $14. Paid $4. Signed up for the email club and they sent me a free burger and fries for my birthday and a BOGO shake for signing up. I expected this place to be more busy at noon but it wasn't bad. The seating is very limited and the service is kind of slow and disorganized- for example they gave me a pager to let me know when my food was ready but ended up calling my receipt number instead of using the pager they gave me. Additionally, the table needed to be wiped down, you could feel the salt and grease had built up on top of it. But the food is the right price for what you get and the location! You could tell by the temperature and taste of the food that it was fresh, so some pros and cons."}
{"text":"After getting a good buzz at Twin Creeks inside the Silverton, and then seeing The Nutcracker performed by the Anaheim Ballet at the South Point, I was ready to get some food in my stomach.  With the talk thread and excitement surrounding the opening of Steak 'n Shake, we decided to check it out.  It's still opening week, so there was quite the wait to get a table, probably about half an hour at 9:30pm.  Don't let that discourage you though, because I was walking out the door at 10:45pm; the service was prompt and you get your food quick!  I'm sure the wait time will dwindle once the buzz dies down.  While waiting in line Jieun and I had enough time to browse the menu and decide on exactly what we wanted.  I went for the Spicy Chipotle Steakburger while she went for The Original Double 'n Cheese.  Word of warning: the burgers here suffer from the same advertising as Wendy's hamburgers.  No matter what the pictures and websites advertise, your burger patty will be smaller!  On my next visit I won't hesitate to get a burger with three patties.  To be fair though, what these steakburger patties lack in size they make up for in flavor!  The meat is seasoned just right without going into the salty beef territory.  There is a special seasoning salt on each table; none of that was necessary since the burger was already delicious!    The milkshakes here are good.  I don't order milkshakes very often, but decided to here because it's part of the restaurant name.  There is a selection of shakes that has two flavors in one glass, but they are side by side and not mixed together.  It's a neat way to serve!  Even with the wait to get in, I came out happy that I tried this place.  One of the best parts of the restaurant is the pricing: for two burgers and two shakes, our bill came to $16 and change.  Not bad at all!  With all the burger meals coming in under $5, you feel like you're getting your money's worth!  I don't think you can even get a full meal for under $5 at a fast food joint, much less one this tasty!  Half jokingly, I made the comment that if I were really hungry, I would order two burger meals and the price would still be on par with Red Robin ;)  With the $2 drink deals that South Point does every so often, I can see Steak 'n Shake becoming a repeat eat!"}
{"text":"I liked my trip to this steak n shake! Everything came out quickly and tasted delicious! The waitress was such a delight. She was an older African American woman with a slightly raspy voice (can't remember her name- think it started with a J) who was friendly, fast, and chatty! Really made our experience!"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this a try again and was a little more pleased than in previous visits. The manager sat me down, introduce me to the waitress, who is very nice. They were prompt, had good etiquette, the breakfast was hot and tasty and the place was clean. So I bumped it up to a mediocre 3 stars and will try it again."}
{"text":"Update recent. Waitress excellent. Food tasty. Your mileage may vary. Stars to 3 now.   Update right up front. My sister and I eat here when I'm visiting her in Ohio. She informed me last night of hair in her salad. Ruined her meal which she couldn't finish.  When did restaurants stop using hair nets or head covering? The waiter had bushy hair. Perhaps. Lost two stars, management, if you are watching and care. Don't ruin what was a good thing.  End of Update.  My favorite Steak 'n Shake when I am in northern Ohio. This is a good location. Steak 'n Shake is my all time favorite restaurant since my first discovery in 1969 in Florida. I have been to many locations, most decent enough. The grill kitchen is in plain view.  Is that what they mean by their slogan, \"In sight, it must be right\"?   Not everyone likes shoe-string French fries so that's not a criticism, just a lack of preference for some.  The menu has grown over the decades whilst maintaining a hold on legacy items like the soda fountain milkshakes, steakburger cuts of meat, shoestring fries, hot fudge sundae, the Chili pasta dishes. There's more to explore if I can ever break away from my favorites.   And, Steak 'n Shakes are not pricey. I read Dave Letterman lists Steak n Shake as his favorite being from the Indiana/Illinois area where this all got started IN THE 30s by Gus Belt!"}
{"text":"Absolutely gross hamburgers and bland tasteless salt less fries.  My boyfriend dragged me here last night telling me the burgers were good. Um no.   My Jalapeño burger was mushy, messy and the crispy onions were soggy. It tasted awful. Seriously in and out is way better than this place.   The standard fries that came with it were small and didn't have any salt at all so I only ate a few before stopping.  The milkshake was equally awful. We ordered a Banana Chocolate version and the taste of fake banana syrup we strong. After 2 sips I gave the rest to my boyfriend.   So all in all gross shakes, burgers and fries. I will never eat at this place again even if it was the last place standing."}
{"text":"I'd rather watch paint dry than come here after 12am to eat. I mean the staff tries to do their job don't get me wrong. I've had my share of the food industry. It's just the wait that kills me. 20+ mins to get seated. Almost an hour for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered the combo and they give me separate orders and charge me for my drink. Ordered grilled onions on my burger and didn't even have any inside. Burger was falling apart. Just shitty. Never coming back. Charged me extra for all this bull shit for no reason."}
{"text":"Any of you that go to the Vegas Steak and Shakes and rate it badly haven't been to a REAL one as they are in the Midwest.  I grew up in the town that SnS originated.  Organic burgers?  NOT!  Parmesan fries?  REALLY?  Chicken Fingers?  CMON!  That is NOT SnS food - that's add ons by the franchisee.  You all want real SnS food?  Take a trip to Central Illinois and everything wrong with the one in Vegas and Tempe AZ (that ones a REAL joke) will more than make up for it with a trip to a real SnS"}
{"text":"Had a great memory with my best friends and husband here.   Always have coupons sent to our home and always great milkshake."}
{"text":"Enjoy their burgers. Stays open late and if you download the digital coupons they accept them."}
{"text":"The burgers are just ok, they aren't great. The shakes are horrible though. We have given this place the benefit of the doubt in hopes that it would get better three times now. Every time we have gone we have ordered shakes and every time they have been icy and gross. Honestly, the price is great here, unfortunately the cheap price also means cheap quality."}
{"text":"Lots of cheap items   Good place for a thin but tasty burger and shoestring fries Shakes are good too Check for \"happy hour times\" to get even a better deal I like that they have a drive through"}
{"text":"Omg amazing and delish food! The frisco burger was ARE YOU KIDDING ME wonderfull. We had to wait in a long line,  like maybe 30-45 mins. But i gotta say the food was worth it.  The chilli on spaghetti was interesting and different, made me feel warm and cuddley inside. We had shakes and they were great I asked the server for extra Frisco Sauce upon ordering when the food arrived she didn't have it but when I asked again she promptly  brought 3 servings and I dipped everything in it! The service over all i have to say was great. The prices for the online menu were different on the restaurant menu, but overall it's pretty inexpensive. And we will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Camer here for a late night bite to eat. Huge portions and very inexpensive and food was decent. I wasn't expecting much from it. The server was also very kind and refilled drinks before we asked."}
{"text":"Milkshakes taste like they are made with ice milk. Not real milk or ice cream. The food wasn't that good either. Not a fan and I'm okay that there are no steak and shakes anywhere near me."}
{"text":"Meh....my husbands double burger was definitely better than my single. Our server was excellent. The food was cheap and the shake was good, but the hostess was a bit rude and had to remind us that even though there was no sign anywhere to indicate we had to wait to be seated and it was not busy yet, that she was supposed to seat us.  Not the best way to start a meal.  It is still hard to beat in and out for price and quality."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of fast food burger places, but Steak 'n Shake is the exception. They are open 24hrs a day so its great for the late night meal if you need it. Prices are great you can get a burger and fries for under 5 bucks. Def my go to on a night I'm tired, don't want to spend much, or drive out of my way."}
{"text":"If you're at South Point and need a cheap place to eat, this is a great place. I had the double steak burger and shared a peanut butter crunch milkshake.   The specialty milkshakes are amazing and are definitely worth getting. They're quite big and hefty so it's worth sharing so you don't get a stomach ache.   The burgers are average and similar to any fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Shake was good. Salad was not good. Service was very poor. I waited more than 8-10 minutes get to table. I am not sure because of I went around 22:00 that's why they took a long. Food values are good. I would say they must have focus on service."}
{"text":"After so much hype from my east coast friends, I was very excited to come here. I had downloaded their app on my phone and couldn't wait to see all the great things they had to offer. Once we got there, I realized that it was a stripped down version of what other \"Steak 'n Shake\" places have. I was completely fine with that, but after receiving my burger and fries, I realized they tasted as though they had been sitting on the counter for a couple minutes.  The Burger. -Cheese wasn't melted -Patty wasn't hot -Not a huge size  Fry's -Overcooked -Not Hot  +Ok taste +Multiple flavor drink machine :D +Friendly Staff  Maybe because this place is new here in Arizona, the staff isn't properly trained yet. Either way, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place. It's a pain to drive/park in Mill Ave just for an \"OK\" burger joint. If your on Mill, then I'd recommend another spot. There were no big negatives from this place, but nothing that made me want to spend the extra $$ above from a fast food spot."}
{"text":"I like the chili & their grilled version of a Chicago hot dog. Steak burgers & fries are just ok. Lots of shake combos though. Wait times can be excessive too."}
{"text":"I've been here only once and i glad to say i'll be back! My friend and I were gambling at South Point and my friend got hungry so we decided to eat there. As we were walking there, I told her that i wasn't that hungry and I'll just order a milkshake. But as soon as we got to the take-out window i saw a special and it was for a Chili burger meal and I just couldn't pass on it! So i ordered that along with my milkshake. I surprised myself and my friend when i ate the whole burger and all of my milkshake. That night, we both said that both our burgers were actually better than In-N-Out. (We are both huge fans of In-N-Out too)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Was looking forward to a good shake  and fries. But my fries were cold and over seasoned, shake was ok."}
{"text":"Our trips to south point are always highlighted by a trip to S&S. We love the shakes and enjoy the cheap burger and fingers specials. Service here is never quick. There is always a wait. The restaurant is never overly clean. The service is friendly and the food is fresh. Personally, that works for me!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. I used to take my girlfriend, brother and nieces and nephew there to dine in, had a few order screw ups some overdone food from time to time and the tables not so clean and greasy menus (not to mention the dirty bathrooms) but i was keen to let it all slide until a few months back. Rode my harley down there around 3am. ordered chicken fingers, fries and a shake. Got home and curled up into bed and there was no chicken fingers. I called em and they were like \"oh yea it's a new guy and he was in a hurry, come back n get em\" i'm like \"yea its cold n i dont feel like warming up my harley and wasting gas to come down there n fix what u guys screwed up can i talk to a manager\". She kept dodging the question till finally she says \"the manager isnt in right now but ill tell him u called\"......im like \"wait dont u want my phone number\" so i told her n i could tell she didnt even take it down (she was all quick and sarcastic about it). the manager never called so i went online to their corporate website and complained and the manager of the store called me wanting to offer me coupons or meal comps or something. No way im going back there after how i was treated by the staff so i can use a meal comp coupon so they know its me and can spit in my food, no thanks. Wouldnt have been a big problem if this wasnt a constant thing for them (poor service and screwing up orders). Now i just go miles out of my way to tiedeman where they dont screw their customers."}
{"text":"Walked in and all I heard was the waitress getting mad and fighting with the cook. There was other arguments going on with each other. I had another waitress bring me my drink. Food took for ever and it was slow at the time. My tomato and a rotten inner piece on it. Sometime $4 meal is just not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! Waited 20 minutes. Food was cold they simply forgot it. Messed up the order on all accounts m. Will never be back"}
{"text":"The interior is very modern and clean The menu is a bit small but it seems to have all the basic necessities I am not familiar with the steak N shake business so I can't go into much detail on the menu haha The owner/manager of the place is extremely nice and helpful I chose the original double cheeseburger with fries, it was only $3.99 Also they have those cool Freestyle Coca Cola machines Cherry coke for days  The burger was made fresh and so were the fries There was great flavor and I really enjoyed it The burger had a unique flavor and I liked it I shall return to the steak N shake Next time I'll try the hot dogs as well as the chili fries"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would. The restaurant is filthy. As a matter of fact, so was the shirt of our server. The food is mediocre at best. The fries were cold. Our milkshakes arrived as I was paying the the bill and the server screwed them up too. Never again. Ever.  I'd starve first."}
{"text":"I give one star for my waitress- pretty attentive and smiled.  2 stars for meat on the double double.  Pretty small portions, just perfect amount for me.  Don't feel as bloated after a double double from here compared to In and Out.  It's definitely a good meal after a night of drinking.  Atmosphere is better than traditional fast food.  Cheap dining for a decent burger!"}
{"text":"Stuck on Vegas with a broken down honda and staying at the hotel.  Vegas location inside South Point hotel. You can't beat it. Prices are so low, prob because it's inside but you cannot complain. Expect a little wait since it's very very busy yet again, can't beat a great diner burger and shoestring fries. My son ordered a shake and it was excellent as well. Best waiter so far in Vegas is here, Walter, he kicks ass! Peace!"}
{"text":"Food was good but had to get my own mustard and refill. no servers touching tables unless dropping something off to table. Talking to cooks more than tables."}
{"text":"Came in at 3:45am 04/01/16 on my way to the airport. They handed me a menu with no breakfast options. I asked to see a breakfast menu and they told me they are not serving breakfast right now. Although, a picture of menu here included breakfast midnight to 11am ...so when do you honestly start serving breakfast?"}
{"text":"The waiter was super nice but it took so long to get some type of service. I am very disappointed. I give it 0 starts. Too bad I had to select at least one"}
{"text":"It was good BUT if you're used to the Midwest offering you'll be disappointed. Very condensed menu vs Midwest. Overall it's good but similar to Freddy's."}
{"text":"Iv'e been here several times and each time the burger is cooked right and juicy to the point of needing to bend over my napkin when I eat it.  It's a steak burger and has great flavor and toppings as well.  The fries with the salt and vinegar are a 10!  I tried the cake batter shake and was disappointed I had ordered the small size because it was so delicious that I wanted more.  This is a stellar option for a quick service burger.  The staff was so cool and nice made the experience even better!  Jamie gave us top notch service!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place and had to try it after a big bowling tournament at Southpoint. I was impressed. Didn't have any customer service issues. I tried the Double Classic with the Double Chocolate Fudge Shake. What a great price/value. I'll definitely be back. Hope it opens up in Bay Area soon. This is the kind of place In/Out and Johnny Rockets wish it could be (imo). They do the the shoe string fries the right way!"}
{"text":"Love having dinner at Steak 'n Shake after a movie.  The prices are perfect for a family of 6.  Always friendly even when they are very busy.  I will be coming back again n again!"}
{"text":"I was exhausted from working constant OT so did NOT make a Thanksgiving feast. I mistakenly thought I would be in the minority of those who didn't cook. We wound up at the South Point and ALL the buffets were packed like sardine cans and totally overpriced so we wound up at this hole full of drunk, loud tourists.   Every employee there was pissed because they had to work and the air was thick with contempt you could cut with a knife. Our waiter, Eduardo was literally the laziest, worst waiter I've had in years. The burgers were dry like the Mohave desert, all the food was overcooked and he never once refilled a tea glass. Basically, he dropped the plates on the table and left. When he returned, he dropped the check ON MY PLATE ON TOP OF MY FOOD AND SAUNTERED OFF!   We were going to order dessert but he never returned. I walked to the register to pay for this sorry excuse for a meal and the cashier who was devoid of any social graces or basic English comprehension was beyond rude. I asked for the season salt, a glass and salad peppers and she froze like a statue and said, \"Are you serious?\"  I said, \"Yes, I'm serious! Move your lazy ass 2 feet to the right or I'll come behind the register and do it myself.\" She stands there dumbstruck not moving so I ask for the manager. Still no movement. She's gone catatonic. So I yell, I need a manager!   This stooge runs over and asks what's going on. I tell him about the poor service and her bad attitude. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. A vacant stare. Again. Somebody must put Xanax in the water there. No offer for a comped meal. Nothing. I informed him I'm not a tourist, I'm local and I'll never eat here again. Still nothing.   Called corporate because I have a low tolerance for bad customer service. When I was a waitress I worked my ass off and left people with a good memory to relate so I had regulars. I have serious issues with the lack of competency, social skills and work ethic of people under 40 lately based on recent experiences.   The Steak 'n Shake restaurants in Houston are so much better. Lately, anything on the strip is lacking in the customer service department."}
{"text":"Stopped to pick something up for my daughter, and I don't believe I've ever waited in line in a drive-through for as long as we did with only one car in line ahead of us(10 minutes). once we got to the drive-through speaker and placed the order it took at least another three or four minutes just to get our order total. then when we got to the pick-up window and had paid we were asked to pull forward and wait for food. even though there was no one else behind us. They did the same to the car in front of us. Had I realized no one was behind us I would have never moved.  When food was brought out it was the same person on the speaker.  And the order was wrong- no surprise. I will not return. Bad experience all around."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 minutes and was extremely excited to eat here as we use to come very often. The onion rings were good and as were the fries, however, our waiter Cherwin did not seem to care to check in on us after giving us our meal, and our bill which we didn't ask for and we're still planning on ordering shakes. Waited about 15 minutes before he passed us for the 5th time so I could finally tell him how disappointed I was with our burgers! All I tasted was bun and cheese. We went ahead to order shakes and not only did they bring me the wrong one, but when I finally got mine it was all melted or watered down or something. I told the cashier and she agreed with me that In N Out is better  Never going here again"}
{"text":"good trip to south point.  hit this spot after the movies. delish. Dad loved the milkshake and Philly burger.  I highly recommend the chili 5 ways. prices are great for a casino.  milkshake, burger and fries, cherry limeaid and 5 way chili  $23."}
{"text":"meh. not worth the 45 minute wait for a table  went when my sister was in town. service was great! the hostess tammie was super informative and friendly. our server was awesome as well, although we did wait a long time for water refills and soda refills. food was ok. decently priced, but nothing really stood out as amazing. the shakes were great though! went during happy hour and all drinks were half off. if you're eating and having a shake, go for the junior."}
{"text":"where to start.. good, bad, or ugly?  First off, i am from the midwest, but i have lived in Arizona most of my life, Steak 'n Shake is my FAVORITE place to eat back home, this location... i will NOT go again (maybe) It has none of the charms like the original, no host(ess), no bar to sit and watch them smash your burger and cook it, only about 50% of the menu, no server to take your order and refill your dr pepper, no sauces sitting out for your food drowning pleasure, and no physical menus you can hold while you decide which tasty burger or dessert you want.. what there is though, are giant tv screens, a touchscreen soda machine, annoying music, and an awkward patio.    where was i.. covered bad and ugly.. oh yeah, the royale was tasty because #iloveegg, and the frisco melt was great too.  But i can get that anywhere, the ambiance sucked."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, nothing like the ones from the midwest. Prices are high and small portion.Besides they wouldn't honor the coupons from steak and shake on the phone."}
{"text":"OK, I splurged and had a double steakburger, those crispy golden shoestring fries, and yes, a strawberry shake. I had to do a double session of cardio the next day, but it was worth it. I mean, the burger was not too big, which I really liked, because I hate it when they give you some huge monstrosity that you can barely get your hands around, let alone keep together. The fries were fresh and delicious, and the shake... OMG, you knew it was going to be a real shake because 1) it came with an extra long shake spoon, and 2) the spoon stood up in the shake. Sure, I was dying of guilt for possibly having undone all my hard work of getting back into shape, but hey, what is life if you can't enjoy a good burger and fries every once in a while??  What I also loved about Steak N Shake was that it was open 24 hours, and the the service was very good and very friendly. Love the condiments!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give this Steak N' Shake a 2-star rating because I've been to it before when it first opened and it was great.  My experiences at other branches have also been decent.    It may have been the fact that we went there around 1030pm and there were only 2 servers/hostess.  There were plenty of tables, but we had to wait to be seated since many of the empty tables still had dirty dishes on them (still true after we sat at our table - they didn't clean the other tables off immediately).    The waitress, poor girl, was running around trying to get everyone.  She acknowledged us, but then took another 10-15 minutes to come back and take our orders.  The food arrived in a timely manner, but they only brought 2 of our 4 orders (missing bowl of chili and she totally forgot to put in hubby's cookies and cream milkshake).  My mom and hubby were almost done with their meals before I got my bowl of chili.  She was apologetic.  Then I noticed the table behind us had been waiting to get refills on their drinks for a while and after a point, the lady went up to the waitress herself and asked for a new drink.  She offered her a complimentary side of fries.  The only redeeming factor was the food.  It reminds me of back in high school when we would go to Steak N' Shake late at night after a movie.  They have delicious mocha shakes, chili mac, and the frisco melt.  I liked how they added a variety of slider flavors and keep increasing their milk shake offerings.  Their shoe-string fries have a nice crispy batter (and the portions are just right).  For a place that's opened 24-hours, they should consider hiring more staff to help on the floor.  It was pretty busy that night.  And please clean up the tables immediately after customers leave - it's pretty unappetizing to eat next to a table of dirty, used dishes.  Shoulda went to COOK-OUT across the street..."}
{"text":"This was the new place to try in South Point, last time we were there we didn't have time to try it. This time we made sure we tried their food. We ordered a butterfinger shake in their take out line. The shake didn't taste like it was made of ice cream. It tasted like water based soft serve. Nothing like the butterfinger shakes at Sonic's, which are creamy. It had plenty of butterfinger chunks and the whipped cream was tasty.   After we returned to our room we realized we wanted to try their food too. We were a large group of 12 and the line at Steak 'n Shake was very long. We choose to order take out and eat it in our rooms. Many ordered the burgers, I had chili cheese fries. The fries are shoe string cut which are not ideal for chili fries. The chili was bland, you didn't taste the spices most chili's have. the cheese was nacho cheese and it easily over powered everything. It felt like i was having just cheese.   I would like to try their burgers next time, it is usually busy so I enjoyed the had the take out option."}
{"text":"Stopped in downtown Tempe for aa quick lunch before heading off to the airport.  Spotted a Steak and Shake...never been in one, thought I'd give it try;  1) nothing really to 'write home' about food wise. An average burger with sub standard fries. The shake...was not mixed correctly/ grainy and lumpy, to thick for a straw...basically, it was soft serve in a cup. 2) the place was disgustingly dirty. Windows were finger printed to the point you couldn't see through the glass clearly.  - coke dispensing machine was 'caked' with dried syrup, and overall just dirty. - trash cans were over flowing, and catsup spills on the floor, walls, trash containers. FYI, I was in at 230pm...the place was pretty much empty. -lastly, the employees uniforms were dirty. I blame this all on management....(or the lack of mgmt)  Do ourself a favor an pass on this establishment....and for this Steak & Shake...visit a IN & OUT establishment...that's how to run a burger house."}
{"text":"YUM! The burger was fantastic, the fries were delicious (especially with the seasoning salt!), and the milkshake was the perfect ending to the meal.    Many different burger choices, too many milkshake flavors to choose from, and the ability to customize your burger how you want, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disfunctional experiences that I've had at a fast food/cook to order joint in a long time.    Went in for dinner on a date night.  Business was apparently good becuase there were barely any tables.  We were seated right away.  Looked around the restaurant and there were like 4-5 tables that needed to be bussed. (Great first impression).  Waitress came by and took our orders.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time so that we could get out in time for the movie.  We waited...and waited...and waited.  Watched food coming outnof the kitchen.  Others that came after us were being served.  2 waitresses came by and filled our drinks and kept reassuring us that our food would be there shortly.   Well, shortly never came.    45 minutes after we ordered,....still no food....and we missed the movie we had planned to attend.  We finally got up and walked out.  On the way out, I heard one of the servers yell to the manager \"Table 13 is walking out\".   Obviously they didnt care.   No one tried to stop us, apologize, or offer anything to make it right for us.  Steak and Shake was a real disappointment.   We ended up going next door to Zaxbys and had our food within 10 minutes.    What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Service in drive thru has really gone down hill.  Almost a dead stop. Been in drive thru for 10 mins before getting to order sign, only 2 cars in front of me.  Was told to review sign while I waited....  after 4 mins, they asked for my order.  It took them 3 mins to take a single order meal with drink, plus a second drink. Have to say, order was correct and tasty."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake... Home of a bunch of $4 meals.  This location is always busy. This particular visit was for early lunch, a little before 12 noon. Ordered a couple sliders, fries and a cherry limeade.  The buns were hard, obviously stale. Fries were cold and over cooked. The worst was the cherry limeade with the moldy limes. I actually took the lime wedges out of the glass and lay them on a napkin in full view for the waitress. They were actually in the way of her putting the plate of food down. She seemed to look at them and didn't say a word.  Done with this location.  Went to the Waterfront location recently... And had the most amazing HOT delicious sliders!"}
{"text":"So after hearing that Croagh Patricks was out of just about all their food, we were starving and didn't want to sit down at another bar and run up a tab so we decided to run into Steak 'n Shake.  Now this is the 1st time I've been to one since 2001, back when it was THE place to hit after many, many drinks.  So this time was different, I am now much older, much more sober, and with a well defined palate....ha....perfect for Steak 'n Shake right?  Well the wife went with the double cheese burger, straight up standard version and I went with the Portabello Swiss with mayo.  We both opted for cheese on our fries.  Well, to be perfectly honest, it wasn't that bad.  The mushrooms were fresh, had a little firmness to them, not the soggy mess I was expecting.  The meat was seasoned well and tasted really good for a fast food type burger.  I normally like my burgers medium but I knew I wasn't getting that here so I just sucked it up and enjoyed my meal.  The cheesy fries were small, probably would have preferred larger fries with more content, but the cheese (yellow crack) added that extra kick that makes you feel all better.  So I hate to say it, but I liked my meal, so did the wife.  We will consider it again next time we are in a bind and need something quick other then Taco Bell.  This location was clean, not very busy, but that was good in a way that we were given full service by the manager, refills and extra napkins without getting up.  Way to earn that $8.50 an hour!!"}
{"text":"If I won Mega Bucks, I would open a Steak 'n Shake right next to every In and Out Burger and drive them out of business. Having grown up in Beef Country and not California, it constantly amazes me how low Californian's and Nevadan's standards are for burgers, poorly cooked fries, and shakes from a machine (like McDonald's) that they line up 20 cars deep to get them.  Yes, in a land where Taco Bell wins \"Best Tacos\" in the RJ's poll, In and Out is the Emperor, but it's not easy to see that he is naked.  Now, this location isn't as good as the ones back home that have been open since the '50s, but they do a good enough job when we go. Their constant wait to get a table or place a Takhomasak order is baffling to anyone from an area where SnS locations have drive thrus or carhop service, but it's worth it. I admire the fact that they have the exact same prices and policies as the rest of the chain, including half price drinks during Happy Hour (2-4). There is no \"casino bump\". Want a double steak burger with cheese and fries for $4? Sure thing.  For the uninitiated, they \"get\" it. That's why they've been in business since 1934. Steak is ground fresh for the burgers. They are served on plates with silverware. Milkshakes are made the right way: by hand and served in tall glasses....MADE FROM GLASS! MILKSHAKES ARE NOT WATERED DOWN ICE CREAM MIX AND SHOULD NOT COME OUT OF A MACHINE!  That also understand another concept: value. Show me a better deal for a better burger in this town! (Here's a hint-you can't.) nothing on the menu is over $6. Even the top shelf burgers with lots of dressings are $5.75 with fries. Heck, the milkshakes, while approaching the fabled \"five dollar shake mythos, are well deserving of the price difference between them and the dreck from the places where quantity is more important than quality.  Oh yeah, then there is the chili, Chili Mac, and rest of the menu. Get chili and cheese on your fries. Totally worth it, since getting here is enough hassle that you won't be doing it often.  The place is always full when we go, so the wait staff is slammed. Adding things to the initial order might be a bit of an ordeal, so try to get it all in one shot. Shoot for Happy Hour and get the shakes for a stupidly low price of just over $2.  This isn't an \"ingrained love from growing up on it\" like folks around here have for In and Out. We didn't have one in my hometown. My love for Steak 'n Shake developed after I was an adult.  Not even ordering from the Super Secret Menu can make me understand why people settle for less at the pretender to the throne that's just a stripped down version, founded 15 years after the original."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Steak 'n Shake. Not awesome. Not gross. Just cheap, easy, comfort food that kicks the shit out of McDonalds and Burger King.   The $4 meals aren't going to be fueling any lumberjacks but it's enough for skinny ol' me. The horseradish burger was actually really good. I was expecting a slightly tangy mayo-ish sauce but it actually had some legit horseradish kick to it.   Atmosphere was alright. Interesting, varied crowd - families, couples young and old, and random old ladies on scooters that ask you to reset their watch for daylight savings time....yep that happened. Location is good - right in Kamm's Corners. If I worked at Fairview instead of Main Campus, I would probably have added about 15 pounds to my ass by now because of this place - it's right around the corner.   A good bet for some quick, cheap eats. Try the new seasoned fries. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"My first trip to this restaurant was two weeks ago, through the drive up.  Food is ok, not spectacular.  I was least impressed with the nearly cold food that came out the window.  So this past weekend, on a late afternoon, we tried it again.  This time, we went inside to order and barely could get waited on.  Won't try it again, unfortunately. Food is good if you can get it hot and quick  Prices are reasonable, but don't make up for cold food"}
{"text":"Came here today after planning out my order on the website before our visit. 3 kids so I only go where there are affordable choices. We were notified that this franchise owner whom I was told is the casino OWNER took away the program. Is this casino hurting that bad that they have to go after kids?!  My bill was over $60 which is unacceptable for basically fast food. When there are so many affordable options on par or better like The Habit, 5 guys, and smash burger. Next time we eat before we come to the movie. I will never understand greedy franchises that try to squeeze a few extra bucks yet in the big picture they just lost a lot more money than they are making bc many customers, my entire family, and the families of my friends kids that I will make sure knows about this change will also be lost business.  They also don't honor the company rewards program."}
{"text":"Not the place you want to go to if you're in any kind of a hurry. Even ordering pancakes, when the batter is already premade, can take forever. Perfectly acceptable if you are willing to spend lots of time in the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time today. 1st dilemma was choosing between the double or the signature. I asked the girl who did a great job explaining that the double is two 2 oz patties vs a 6 oz on the signature. She assured me she could eat the signature so I went with that. Was worried the smaller one would leave me hungry cause it was $2 cheaper. I also wanted to try some seasoned fries. Asked what was popular and she said the Parmesan so I tried it. That was a mistake. To strong! Wish I would have went with regular fries. Still like 5 guys and in and out fries better. The burger was good. Very juicy, bun was yummy. No complaints about that at all. The location was clean, the girl came and cleaned up after me before I could even leave the place and it wasn't rush hour. Did not try the shake."}
{"text":"Bad service and typical I don't care attitude it to mention barely full containers. Further more when I brought it to his attention he began arguing with me telling me how wrong I am and that I \"don't know they policy\"  Mediocre food with good service is tolerable but toss in a horrible customer experience and poof your establishment is garbage. I should also mention that I was able to take the photos and write the review all while waiting for the manager to get free......this location is less than 1 star don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Dismal, at best. No signage or staff indicating how to get seated. After a 30 minute wait, we got seated..at a dirty table. 10 minutes later someone wiped the table - and the thought to get us menus at our clean, wet table. After taking our order - the Waitress had a nice long chat with the next table - none of which was about food - then went to place the order. When the food finally arrived, it was mediocre at best, and they got my wife's order wrong. Waitress blamed it on the cooks - but receipt showed clearly she had entered it wrong. All in all - an epic fail. Never again. I advise anyone who reads this to skip this location entirely."}
{"text":"Last night I went to this location after a 16 hour shift and ordered one milkshake. After paying, the young man working the window asked me to pull forward and told me he would bring it out to me. Within one minute he brought it out to my car and as I was going to put it in my cup holder, I accidentally spilled half of my milkshake. After a minute of me still sitting in the same spot, trying to clean up my mess, the same worker came back to my car to make sure everything was okay. After explaining what I had done, he went back inside and came back with napkins, wet towels to help with stickiness, and told me he already had someone making me another milkshake. I was blown away by the great customer service. I don't know what it is about this location, but everyone, who works the night shift here, is always so kind, positive, and goes above and beyond. Thank you for the great service always!!"}
{"text":"My love letter to Steak n' Shake:  Ever since the first day I saw your picture online I have thought about you...longed for you. Love at first sight? Perhaps. I am a hopeless glutton, and the fastest way to my heart is through my stomach. The more I read your menu and explored your website the more I was drawn to you.  I dreamed about you. I imagined what our first meeting would be like. I knew what I would order and knew exactly how it would taste. I wanted to meet you in person but the closest SnS was in Texas...just like Romeo and Juliet, the universe was keeping us apart. Yeah, sure, I explored other options...In n' Out, Five Guys...but while I was with them, I was thinking about you.  You can only imagine my excitement when I heard that you were coming to Las Vegas, my home away from home. My heart soared. I didn't want to appear too desperate so I gave you a week to get settled in to your new home. When I arrived I knew exactly how it would be...how you would look...what I would order. You made me wait 30 minutes, but what was 30 minutes more of  a wait to meet my soulmate. And it was indeed worth the wait. It was a love connection! We spent two amazing nights together...nights I will remember forever. And although I had to leave you, I will return to you...soon, and often.  OK, now that I have totally creeped you out here is what we ordered. We actually went twice in 2 days...yeah, it WAS that good:  Wisconsin Buttery Burger-two delicious crusty perfectly cooked steakburger patties, one slice of gooey melty cheese, all covered in butter. Yeah, this was pretty much heaven.  Guacamole Steakburger-the same two delicious patties, jalapeno jack cheese, and yummy guacamole. So good!  Triple Steakburger with cheese-more of the same goodness...3 patties and two slices cheese.  The burgers come with amazing shoestring fries. They are thin and crispy and the seasoning salt is awesome!  A side of chili- A bowl of luscious chili flavored reddish-brown liquid filled with perfectly cooked kidney beans and ground steakburger meat. More like chili beans than standard chili, but you can pay a $1 for extra beef. It was really delicious.  Hershey's Special Dark Shake- Creamy, fluffy, frozen, chocolate heaven. The shake was gigantic and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips.  Peppermint Chocolate Chip Shake-This was one of the special holiday shakes they had on the menu (Along with white chocolate and egg nog.) It was a minty, chocolately Christmas celebration in my mouth!   We had great food and great service both times we went. It is in the casino in the South Point Hotel, and there was a 30 minute wait each time. I am just so sad there isn't a SnS near Los Angeles."}
{"text":"So... finally I get to experience what the fiancé, Jon, has been talking about for years. When he found out that Steak & Shake was opening he got so excited he wanted to just go stand outside and wait for it to open.   We had our date night on Mill this week and had dinner at the infamous S&S. It was very good! I got the burger with the guac on it, super yummy, just enough heat in the guac and the bun was perfectly toasted. The French fries were my favorite part of the meal by far. Super salty, crispy and tons of them. Way better than anyone else's in my opinion!   I also had the fresh banana and chocolate shake, fresh banana is the way to go. It was sooooo good and totally filling, I tried to finish it but almost burst.   Jon says it isn't like the one's back home, Michigan, but he was pleasantly surprised how close it was. We will be back for sure! Probably wont drive across town just for that again, but if we are in the area, we will make a slight detour."}
{"text":"We grew up in the Southeast part of the US where there is a Steak n Shake on every corner of our city.  So we took for granted having one close.  It is great to have one west of the Mississippi.  I have heard this is the only one!!  Fan of :  milkshakes and fries. Not a fan of:  the \"steakburgers\" which is just a flattened burger.  What is called a steakburger??  Not steak in sight!!  Only ground beef.  Still from the same source, but don't call it a steak when it ain't one :)  We stopped by here late one night and just got a shake to go.  We put on the paper hats just for funsies :)  Try it for the shakes and fries.  Hey, even dip the fries in the shake AKA Wendy's fries dipped in a Frosty.  Holla!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to steak and shake last weekend on Sunday in between meals so it wasn't terribly busy and the service was absolutely horrible.  We sat at a table for over 15 minutes w/o a single server coming to take our drink or or anything.  Servers were walking by our table many times and checking on other tables after they were already tended to but would not wait on us. Even when we got up to leave no one seemed to care. We went next door to Board Walk Billies and had WONDERFUL service and great food.  It was so much better than the mess they would of served us at Steak and Shake.  I honestly think it was a race thing and that is why they didn't wait in us."}
{"text":"Steak and shake is great but this one is the worst.  We went there and waited like 10 minutes to even be seen and seated.  After that we waited 20 minutes and no one came to the table once so we left. This was absolutely the worst steak and shake I have ever been to and I will never go back."}
{"text":"We had never been to a Steak 'n Shake before moving to ohio. We have heard many good things so we came with high expectations.  With that said.....they nailed it.  We love the food!  I have decided the taco salad is my favorite and my husband is still trying a different burger every time we go.  It can get busy but we have never had to wait for a table.  Servers are always friendly and you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"Seriously this place blows Shake Shack out of the water. The meat is so, so good. My husband and I got to skip the long line for dining in since we were only a party of 2. I believe they had a few deals on combos that ranged from $4-6. We also got a birthday cake shake and a Nutella shake. The Nutella shake was yummy and creamy, but it was just extremely decadent and sweet. I'll definitely be back for the burgers though."}
{"text":"Wow,  what a great price!  Wait - Okay this can be a bit long, so use the facilities before you get in the line...  Service - Top Notch.  Price - Very reasonable.  Burgers - WOW Very tasty, lots of choices, juicy, big, tasty, tender, scrumdiliumptious.  Shakes - An art form, a masterpiece, a Leonardo da Vinci!  Diet - All this is great for your diet.  If you are on a see food diet!  Final result - Shake your booty on down the the SouthPoint Casino and check out this place, if you can withstand all the smoke."}
{"text":"Man, I do remember waiting in line for like an hour when the first Steak 'n Shake opened at the South Point Casino years back. I thought it was a fun experience and the food was good.  We actually have been there a couple of times.  They key at that time was I guess the Shakes?  They were great. The burgers, pretty good.  Today, we decided to try out the latest opening of Steak 'n Shake on St. Rose off the 215.  I have just a few questions:  1. What is the benefit of this location? It is an uninviting strip mall, although new, the buildings BACKS are facing the street and the parking lot is inside.  It is very \"closed\" off and you really cannot see Steak 'n Shake signs or even the restaurant. Hard to find out where the drive in actually is, since you are part of a row of strip mall stores and you do not stand out at all. Definitely textbook case of how not to design a fast food place.   2.  Did you notice when you have a car at the ordering speaker, that no one of your team answers or asks a question of what you want until your customer starts asking things like...\"hello?  Anyone there?\"  3.  Did you notice that while the line was not tremendously long on a Saturday at about 12:45 pm, there were only three cars, that a more than 12 minute wait seems a bit too much? Seemed more like 30 minutes.  Maybe due to each burger being custom made? Well, that is a long time still.  4.  Hey, um we ordered the Prime Texas Steak BBQ Burger.  Where was the BBQ sauce? Hey, um we ordered fries seasoned with parmesan.  Were you running low, we had two orders and the little pouch they are served in were like half full not topped on and a bit anemic.  5.  Overall, I would say it is not bad, the food tastes good, as our other order was the Original Double Cheese.  However, the missing BBQ sauce made the other order dry and not tasty.  The anemic looking bag of fries makes you feel gypped and the long line just seems not great. Combined with being in a poorly designed new strip mall, no signage, and nothing stand out about this place, I would say, I am not excited, note sure if I will be back and hope that they can straightened this out very soon.  GK says, if you have a hankering for a great burger, go to one of their other stores that are established."}
{"text":"Worth the drive to South Point casino to get a yummy double cheese steak burger and fries for $3.99!  We had to wait in line for half an hour to get in. Apparently there was a gymnastic tournament and it was packed with kids and their families.    Staff was very friendly and we got to order our food pretty quickly and got our burgers fast too.  The food was very delicious.  Fries were good too, but after putting black pepper and whatever red powder goodness that was on the table, they were super delicious.   We didn't have room to order dessert this time but there is a wide variety of ice cream shakes available.  Priced around $5 and change.  I enjoyed my food here and it was nice seeing other people from Hawaii here also, it almost felt like home."}
{"text":"My son loves this place and since it was his turn to pick here we are again waiting an hour for food. I don't know why it takes so long but the wait is always horrible here. The waitress left us hanging while she slowly walked around and cleaned tables. It's nerve wrecking when people who come in after you get there food before you. I watched my kids food sit under the lamps for 15 minutes and had to bring it I the waitresses attention. When she replied that she knew and was waiting on the rest of our order. *sigh* I'm still waiting! But the food is good, just takes forever. Maybe next time we try the drive through...."}
{"text":"I love steak n shake, they have great food and great service! I love the garlic steak burger I swear I could eat one everyday if I could lol."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever had in a drive thru. Sat at the speaker for 15+ minutes waiting. Highly don't recommend."}
{"text":"I like the take out or dine in Option at this location.  Burger was ok, fries were ok but the shake ( health bar) was really good. I had the minis with BBQ on the side ( they forgot to put it in the bag) and my hubby had the mushroom burger. We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"This is a horrible steak and shake!  Stopped to get food to go. Got a drink, then in a few minutes the food. After another ten minutes asked one of the girls behind the counter if the shake we ordered was ready and she snapped \"they must be making it\". Another ten minutes of several staff members ignoring me and I finally had to walk over to a waiter despite two girls standing with nothing to do behind the counter. There were very few customers and lots of staff, the service should have been good and the place spotless. The floor is dirty and sticky and my food was cold. Needs a new manager and staff with training in customer service."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on the weekends so it is always packed.  this is a diner joint even though it is a franchise.  You get diner quality food which is good for me.  I have yet to have a garlic cheeseburger that I do not enjoy here. When crowded be patient as most of the staff is working hard."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak 'n shake locations to visit. Our waitress Aesha was super nice and attentive. Food was great and everything came out perfect. Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I was raised on Steak 'N Shake and am from where it originated. It's been a family institution for 8 decades. My parents frequented the original SnS. My grandparents frequented the original SnS & knew the Belt family. For all the Yelpers out there, I simply ask that, before you write off Steak 'N Shake based on a 'Signature' 1/2 store that is the Tempe location, please try eating at an actual sit-down classic Steak 'N Shake restaurant. The Signature store is NOTHING like the real deal. No exaggeration.   On to the review:  Finally tried Steak 'N Shake in Tempe today. Verdict: HIGHLY disappointed. Ordered original double cheese w/ fries. Zero crispy edges on slightly warm, mushy burger. ZERO CRISPY EDGES ON A STEAK 'N SHAKE ORIGINAL BURGER?? Crispy edges are a REQUIREMENT and WHOLLY DEFINE an original Steak N' Shake burger since 1934, goddammit. Limp tasting, overcooked fries. In-N-Out Burger is multitudes better than SnS Signature, and I don't even particularly like In-N-Out. A manager stopped by & asked how things were, and I just told him 'As a guy whose family is from Normal, Illinois, we've been eating @ Steak 'N Shake literally from day 1 - /for 80 years now/ & I wouldn't dream of bringing them to this location.' Everything was just 'off'. Not a single thing tastes or feels familiar about this 'Signature' location. It's really almost as if it's not even affiliated with the regular restaurants. The two friends I brought with me today said they'll never go back. I can't blame them. The /only/ thing going for this location is pricing. Contrast my Tempe experience with my most recent experiences at REAL SnS locations in Austin, TX last November & 2012 in Bloomington, IL: Pure joy. Everything was as it should've been.   I simply can't understand why they've chosen to roll these Signature stores out; it'd be almost as if In-N-Out Burger showed up in Peoria, IL & served ham salad sandwiches.   I think SnS is doing irreparable damage to their brand with these stores."}
{"text":"Lunch time in a casino and they had two servers and one poor lady busing the tables. There were plenty of people chilling behind the register though so no worries on getting someone to take care of your bill if you can actually get seated and severed before losing your mind and running out of there screaming.  Food was good, I loved the skinny fries, and the price was seriously cheap.  The shake options were out of control but I narrowed it down to the banana and it made the fat girl in me giggle with joy. I wouldn't drive out of my way to hit this place up but if I was in the casino I'd stop in."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through, only to be told to pull up and wait for someone to bring out our meal... and now we've been sitting here for 20 minutes for only two burgers. Serious waste of time. Will not be coming back, and customer service is terrible on top of everything else. I'm surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this chain's food or this locations service.  However!    Steak n Shake milkshakes totally rock.  Very thick, regular is the perfect size to get me home from the Waterfront."}
{"text":"Always getting my order wrong! Used the tapingo app to get a grilled cheese WITH grilled onions, which was an extra 50 cents and it didn't have anything but cheese! Didn't notice until I was halfway across campus, ridiculous honestly."}
{"text":"Was good food for the price. It was our first time trying it so we did not realize how small the burgers were though so kinda disappointed. But overall good."}
{"text":"Omg this place is horrible! They messed up my order. The fries were cold and I mean cold. The service was as cold the fries. After the not so great food and 30 min before the place was to close, I walk past the 6 other customers to restroom to find it barricaded and of limits. I ask the girl behind the counter if can use it and and told it was closed. I emphasized that I was in need only needed to pre yet I was told to go to the Jack in the box across the street. Yay! The competition had been closed for 40 minutes when we got there. Walked back intro the steak n shake and firmly let them know I had to go. She calls a kid from the back who makes me repeat my desires and I throw in a promise not to urinate everywhere. He goes and gets the manager. I can tell this guy was not wanting to accommodate me. Still he let me pass. This was my birthday experience with steak n shake. I should have gone to Jack n the box to begin with."}
{"text":"Jumping on the current bandwagon and braving the crowds...the Husband loves steak, and I love shakes...so we headed to the grand opening week of Steak 'n Shake at South Point Hotel and Casino in Vegas.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, \"Do you know when they are going to open?\"  On Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!    The Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt \"Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough.\"  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.    Meanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.  Of course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact!   I also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.  And yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)  Overall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.  They are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).    Happy hour: Weekdays only, 2 pm to 4 pm, and 2 am to 4 am - Half off shakes and drinks"}
{"text":"Ehh...not bad, but I've had better. The cheeseburger was good. The fries were flavorless. The strawberry shake wasnt anything special. If in the hotel again and everyone else wanted to eat here i wouldnt be opposed to it, but it wouldnt be my first choice, or my second."}
{"text":"I'm leaving a 1-star review only because Yelp won't let me go with 0-stars.  I also cannot leave a review for the food due to us picking up & leaving before we could get a food order in due to the lack of organization in this place.  The table of 6 sitting next to us mentioned they had been waiting for close to an hour, and 5 of the six were just about done with their food and one person was still waiting.  We said forget it, and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated & our food very quickly.    It appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced.  Poor management, poor attitudes, and I can only imagine what goes on with the food preparation.  Save your hard earned money and avoid this Steak 'n Shake at all cost."}
{"text":"So originally I really loved this Steak and Shake. Offered everything that a normal Steak and Shake went offer. But times have changed and it is no longer the once great establishment it once was. They have gotten rid of Staples like the four under four, the rewards program , and even the specialty burgers. Another thing to note is the quality of the food as well as the quality of service. It took over 30 minutes for us to get food, even though it was slow. Our waitress only came by twice , one time to ask what we wanted, and the next to hand us our bill without saying a thing. I no longer wish to come to this Steak and Shake, let's hope that a real one will open in the city."}
{"text":"I understand that Steak & Shake cooks their food upon ordering, but there should be no excuse why it took my son and I almost an hour to order a kid's meal and a milkshake yesterday around 6:10p. It took 20 minutes alone to be able to pull up to the ordering station and then almost 40 minutes to get to the drive thru and pay.    When I ordered my food, an airplane just so happened to be flying over the building as I was talking. The lady taking my order annoyingly said, \"I can barely hear you!\"  I let that pass. I used to work in the food business. I know we all have our days.   After I ordered, I pulled up one car length and sat there. Nothing happened for a while. I just sat there. There were 4 cars ahead of me. My son was being great, so we just hung out so I could get him dinner.  So much time passed, that the lady in front of me drove off before paying.   When I got to the drive thru, the older lady thanked me for my patience and apologized for the delay. I paid for me food and drove home.  I knew they were busy. I was just happy to get the food so I could feed my kiddo.   When we got home 4 minutes later, I took out my son's meal, I got him a hog dog and fries. The hog dog was still warm, but the fries were cold and there was no apple juice in there.  One would think that it is not the end of the world with the drink missing and all, but that pretty much ticked me off after waiting for almost an hour to get fast food.   I'm done with them. Next time, I'll just pay a little more at a real restaurant and have a quality meal with my son in probably much less time."}
{"text":"I mean....check my other reviews and I make a point to never write a bad review despite any short coming or problem or interaction I give the place the benefit of the doubt, because I am in the industry and understand the behind the scenes importance.  However, this was a classic case of poor structure on behalf of management/owners.  I went in to the drive thru around noon and it had 2 cars already placed their orders and waiting to pay so I placed my order and waited.  30 min later I pay for my food, and I feel 30 min wait for a drive thru/fast food should almost never happen but, you live and you learn.  My negative review comes after I received my order,  wrong burger, wrong fries.  I agree if you say it's my fault I should have checked the bag myself,  but after 30 min in Las Vegas heat at high noon I'm sure you would be in a rush as well.   I won't cone back to this store,  I apologize if anyone who works there is offended.  Although when I received the nastiest gray burger patty w a disgusting sauce....i had to give you guys a 0"}
{"text":"Steak N Shake is just awesome. We don't have one in Vermont. So this really was a great treat for us when we visit Ohio!  We came with milkshakes on our mind! And it was worth it. The staff here was very nice and sat us quickly. We came around 9pm or so and they still had a good crowd here. The tables and restaurant was very clean!  We got a butter finger milkshake to share. The reason for this? We just had dinner and we wanted something sweet and they are huge. Let me add this got the job done.  We ended up spending $6.38 + $2.00 tip. The staff still treated us great even though we did share! (Also note it was not filled up busy. Just about half full. We aren't them rude people! :P)  All in all it was great. When we visit again we will be back! So if your in the mood for a great shake look no further. They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I could have ever imagined! The restaurant was disgusting from ceiling to the floor. Was almost empty but two tables and still took ten minutes to be approached and seated. The food was burnt and rough. Ran out of items on the menu and waited to inform us after the order was in for five minutes. Staff sitting at the bar area eating, drinking, and talking about the guest that were in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst Steak 'N Shake restaurant I've ever been to. Steak 'N Shake is my go to if I'm just in the need of some quick fast food and driving back home, but after this visit, I'm not sure if that's the case anymore.  After ordering a grilled cheese and a regular fry, I sat in the drive-thru for over 25 minutes waiting for the workers. That's honestly ridiculous! I probably could have ordered it faster inside and left. Then, while I was still talking, guy that was working the window literally shut the window while I was talking! Could he have been any ruder?!   As if that wasn't bad, my fries literally just tasted like cardboard and my grilled cheese wasn't cooked all the way. I will no longer visit Steak 'N Shake, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Since I haven't been to the midwest full menu places I can't compare but base this review solely on my visit.  It was dead in the place being ASU was on break.  Food menu is pretty limited but the prices were fair. Was disappointed in the milk shake as it was rather plain. Had the guacomole burger and it was ok also. I'm knocking it down from 4 stars to 3 because the place was dirty.  All the tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down all day, and like I said the place was empty so no excuse for having a dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh I've been here a couple of times and it was just ok. A few of my friends had hyped this place up so I expected it to be amazing. The menu seemed a lot smaller then what was online. The shakes were also just ok. For the price I also expected better. It's not horrible, but it is definitely not the first place I'd go for a burger.   Also the service isn't excellent. I think it's kind of weird how all the girls have red lipstick, and nails. The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu. I'd much rather go to the In-N-Out down the road."}
{"text":"In and Out is a fast cheap novelty, Steak and Shake is unbelievable with a much much better menu and their steakburgers are so delicious,  string fries are delish. Just a better burger and they are about to invade Southern California with about 20 new spots, very excited."}
{"text":"I have been dining here periodically for the last few years.  There are ALWAYS coupons in the back of magazines and flyers in the mail where I live so it's hard to ever forget about Steak-n-Shake.  This establishment is open 24 hours so for late nighters Steak 'n Shake is always an option along with the happier hour 2 am to 5 am half priced shakes can really sweeten the idea of getting Steak 'n Shake.  For me though, I only like to go IF I do have a coupon (Yeah, I know, I'm cheap but all you have to do is know where to look off and online or if you receive mail in Cuyahoga County and there will most likely be coupons for Steak 'n Shake.    Every time I have visited here I have to wait.  Even when there were only about 5 tables being used and I ordered food to go I have waited up to 20 minutes for the Frisco Melt!  I don't understand the waiting here when there is such a LARGE grilling area that the size of the stove top resembles the length of a kitchen counter so they can't find a spot on the grill for a to go order that is waiting at the counter?  I don't know if they determine how many cooks based on the drive thru and dining room customers but it also seems that when they are busier my orders are received in a much more timely fashion and they operate much quicker at times during busy hours but not ALL the time.  Basically, it doesn't matter how many customers are present inside or at the drive-thru it is still and always VERY difficult to determine just how long your order will take.  Whether your food is made quickly or takes an awfully long time it will most definitely be greasy that you can see it (and feel it when you grab and pick up your food) seep through wrapper and onto the bag.  I don't think I have to say it but Steak 'n Shake will probably never be featured in \"Healthy Living\" magazine anytime soon.    All of this leads up to my visit at Steak 'n Shake on an early December Saturday morning.  I had just dropped my parents off at Hopkins Airport around 3:30 am because my parents always pick the early morning flights for vacation.  On the way back home I decided to visit this Steak 'n Shake along the way.  As I drove into the drive thru I looked inside the dining room and there was no one inside so that was a good sign.  I ordered the triple steak burger meal for $3.99.  I pulled up to the window and a car was in front of me waiting for their order.  The time clock starts.  I listened to an entire Christmas song on the radio (about 3-4 minutes)  before I saw any food leave the window to be given to the customer in front of me. It took another minute to finish preparing their beverages.    Now it was my turn.  I pulled up to the window, they gave me the total and I paid kind of expecting for my food to be done.  It wasn't.  Not only that but I continued to wait another 5 minutes after I paid for my order.  After I received my food and was on my way home, I decided to try some fries along the way home.  They were cold!  I was just so fed up that I didn't want to head back there and deal with them and their slow service.  I mean, REALLY?  They made the fries FIRST and let them sit in the bag!  They were definitely not fresh.  Worse than the fries was the triple steak burger.  The patties they used or made rather looked like what can only be described as meat in the form of Swiss cheese.  Flat with holes in them.  If this is how Steak 'n Shake makes their patties and it takes them a large amount of time to produce patties that come out looking like they were mutilated then it will probably be a very long time before I try Steak 'n Shake again and I hope when you order that your meat patties turn out solid and do not look like Swiss Cheese."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal was about this place but it want too bad. the line to get in was long n felt like forever since I was starving. Anyways the waitress was very nice n had some great choice suggestions. my roomie got the western bbq burger with a chocolate strawberry shake, n I got the buttery grilled onion burger with bacon. Ermagahd..haha it was good n bad at the same time. the only thing was my plate was covered on oil n I had to eat my burger upside down since the bread was soggy. Other than that it was good comfort food.  I'm just glad I didn't get the waiter who helped the other table. He didn't listen to their order at all, n almost gave a cheese burger to a lactose intolerant lady. No bueno :("}
{"text":"I have had better service in a food truck in Southern Chicago. If you ordered a water in the most remote region of the Sahara desert it would come faster than it did here. The level of apathy within the workers would make a depressed nihilist scream at the top of their lungs from how meaningless these workers seem their job to be. Frisco melt was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake brings back a lot of good memories of growing up in the midwest. Of being bored at 2 a.m. and hanging out there cause it was the only place in town that was still awake.  Unfortunantly, this location seems to be one of of the few Vegas establishments that ISN'T open 24hrs.  Which was a real bummer because on at least 2 occasions we tried to go there and it was closed. (Fool me once....)  When you do get in, expect a wait at peak times, and slow service at all times.  Food is spot on-classic-Steak 'N Shake though."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake on the west coast. What can u say!!!   I grew up in Florida so I grew up eating here and miss it. Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I stop and have a meal here but may not continue  the waitress was fine very efficient and friendly but the burger was NOT up to par not sure exactly what it was but it didn't taste right and was a little cold to boot  also the cooks don't wear their traditional paper hats. The chili was good as always"}
{"text":"Driving from GA to VA we saw a Steak & Shake and decided to grab dinner since it's one of our favorite fast food places. Went through the drive through and was told to pull to the side since our food wasn't done. After waiting 10 min we finally went in only to find out they had completely forgotten our order! To make matters worse there was no apology instead we had to wait another 15min to get our food. Once we had our food we headed out only to find out the fries were cold the BBQ Burger had no BBQ Sauce and my Mushroom Burger only had 2 Mushrooms! Worst Steak & Shake Ever!"}
{"text":"Michelle at the take out register has a bad attitude . Giving it to everyone too. Either she need better training or get better costumer service. Told someone in a ride voice , \"number 15? Yeah I've been calling that out for a while now\" smh."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and thought it was going to be amazing . The lighting was SO bright it made you dizzy . The burgers had barely and meat and the shake was not what I expected I ordered the cookies and cream and the oreo was just on the top the rest was just vanilla ice cream . Not impressed"}
{"text":"It was mediocre. I don't know why there was a hype about it. The fries weren't crispy and was drenched in oil. Waiting time was crazy long too. My 1 hour lunch break was too quick. Burgers were small. The only good thing about the restaurant is the malts and shakes. Yum! Maybe I'll try to come when it's not rush hour, maybe my fries will be cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food and service. 25 minutes to cook a burger that was given to me cold. Onion rings were nasty, which I didn't order, never got my drink. Would be hard to feed that to my dog."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  They definitely need to build another one in town for the locals.  We go here any chance we get.  Nice and affordable too it hard to find a nice sit down meal on a budget but you get it all."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. I mean steak n shake is a chain. But this one is like the runt of the litter and its starved of its mothers milk. I have had more bad experiences at this location than good. They range from screwing up my main course to totally forgetting my salad. For both of these previous mistakes the answer was to put my name on a list to get a salad or main dish for free. But when i came in to claim my free meal I asked the server to ask the manager. She looked and came back and said the manager could not find me on the list but she was okay with giving me a free meal?   This visit I entered with a friend. We stood waiting to be seated while the servers were talking about some picture... There was two other tables in the restaurant.... and about three servers.   our server came over and took our drink order.  came back... way. later... and took our food order.  my friend ordered chili and added a side of seasoned fries.. Apparently, no one orders fries with chili as she repeated his fry order about 4 times and looked totally confused.   So then we sat... and sat... and sat... and sat.. and sat... and sat... We were sitting by the service window so I could see the kitchen. It was not that they were busy... they were simply not working on our order. I see our main courses come up. Then one salad... Then she brought our main course? I could see that only one salad was ready. I am not an idiot.  I ask soo.... what happened to our salads?  O right umm, I think maybe one is umm ready let me check...  And so she stands by the service window waiting for them to make the other salad with awful italian dressing.   So in essence we got our salads after our main courses.    Add to that the server apologized to the table behind us,, and we get... a high school cafeteria folks.  Now the server was not nice until she saw that I tipped ( After writing this I think I should not have). I honestly do not get how this location is in such bad shape.  The streetsboro one is amazing. The manager and server remember me and I only go to that one like once every few months... whos hiring at the macedonia one? Are they just hiring young attractive girls? Are they screening at all? Are Brains simply optional?"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a burger and a reasonable price for Las Vegas.  Not the fastest preparation but a nice selection of burgers.  I was a little surprised that the burger really was not that juicy but everyone in our party was happy to have reasonable food.  The Royale Burger (with the fried egg) was okay, but the egg yolk was broken.  Nothing over the top, but the salads we saw at the other table looked good."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Steak and Shake: Don't waste your time, UNLESS you don't mind waiting in your car at the drive thru for 15 min, you pull up to the window to pay and see that your food has been on the counter for what seems to be quite some time. They hand over the cold bundle of skeewompisly prepared burgers and fries along with a warm watered down shake, that was supposed to be peanut butter cup but forgot to add the fixings. Doesn't this all sound pleasant?  Honestly though, maybe they weren't having the best day when we ordered our food...understandable. We would have given Steak and Shake a second chance EXCEPT, the paper sack our food came in was sooo greasy AND the shake and water cups were overly sticky. It was incredibly gross touching everything. :( There seems to be a lack of pride in food prep happening at this specific location, which is a bummer because it's freaked us out enough to never try it again no matter where we're at. :/"}
{"text":"So, this morning,  I  took my Grandson for Breakfast.  915am,  order taken around 938am. We got out food at 10:12am.  Completely ridiculous.   One server, one cook. Excuse was they didn't think that they would be open after Ebertfest. REALLY?  Yesterday was the marathon. Your manager didn't think there would be any business this weekend?  Especially on a Sunday?  Omg. Wtf. I'm never coming back. Joke joke joke. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"After reading some of the previous reviews I guess you have to be from the Southeast to under stand how prolific steak and shake really is. I remember going to my first one in Florida before they moved the chain outside of the state. Due to this I understand why people will wait in line for this place.  To our most recent experience. The line was semi long when we got there but we were seated in a matter of 15 minutes. We all had shakes, my favorite is the Strawnilla side by side shake (half strawberry, half vanilla). The best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Frisco melt and there chilli is great. The food was good and the price beats Johnny Rockets anyway. We will be back! The service at our visit was a little slow so that is why I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was on Mill with my fiancé and 7 year old daughter. My daughter wanted a hot dog, so in we went. It wasn't busy, yet the tables were dirty. I went up to the manger to ask for a wet rag to wipe off my table. He didn't respond, but the girl at the counter he was flirting with did. If you go in with the mind set that this is really a fast food joint, you won't be disappointed. Until you pay your bill. Same quality as Mcdonald's for more money.. far better places to eat on Mill for the same money...."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Fucking embarrassingly bad and ghetto, rude service. Pull up to the window late night (around 1:45am). I'm greeted with \"Yo.. I'll be wit u n a minute.\" Thirty seconds later... \"it gon be like 15-20 minute before u get service, we got 5 tickets in the dining and we have to get that done first.\" Wow, what the actual fuck? But I say that's fine and I politely wait. And I wait. And I FUCKING WAIT. Finally, after 25 minutes.. I simply put the car in reverse and roll back the forward. And I'm again greeted with, \"Yo.. I'll be with you n a minute.\" A few more moments go by.. I been her 30 minutes at this point might as well wait it out right? Ha, jokes on me man! FINALLY I get some sort of half ass service.. I ask for 2 banana shakes and a large fry. The response? \"Ah man, if I had known you wanted a shake I would have been had told you to pull off.. our shake machine is broke.\" Are you fucking with me steak and shake? You've got to be fucking kidding me. This is literally the worst service that I have ever received anywhere and I've worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years now. I will never again eat this restaurant. You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves and embarrassed treating customers like that. WOW!"}
{"text":"Don't come in here expecting hot food. The service is so slow it was barely warm. We had to ask for our shakes 3 times before they were brought out even when the server said they were ready.  For a Saturday afternoon they we're not that busy."}
{"text":"Ordered the guacamole burger and fries. Nothing to get excited about. Looked like Ruby's, but was a step down (plus I don't think much of Ruby's anyways).  The shakes looked good, but I didn't want to waste my calories on that.  I've always seen commercials of this place and wanted to try it since there aren't any in California. I tried it and wasn't impressed.  Honestly, the best thing at South Point is the .75 cent 100% beef hot dog cart in the casino!"}
{"text":"No matter which Steak & Shake I go to, in whatever town, the drive through is always the worse. This one is no exception.  I hate having to repeat my order once I get to the window.  Dining in is always the first choice for me. You get better service."}
{"text":"I've never been to this chain before and decided to visit the take-out line at Southpoint hotel.  What a disappointment this experience was, unfortunately.  I ordered a small strawberry shake and a small chocolate shake (~$3 each).  There were frost chunks in the shake.  Eww.  Also, the order and pick up line was disorderly and painfully slow.  I'm holding out hope that the chain will be better when I visit the Midwest one of these days.  Other important info:  Inside Southpoint hotel, take-out line available, and located at the bottom of the stairs of the movie theater."}
{"text":"Went to Steak n Shake today looking for the real thing from the Midwest.  It was not.  The menu is very limited and ripping people off with a 6.99 organic steak burger.  Steak n Shake burgers are supposed to be thin and this was not.  It was a greasy mess.  I could not finish it because it was laying all over the box.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Smaller menu, smaller portions, and bigger price tag. I got to experience it when it first opened and it was great! A limited but great menu and when I experienced the typical diner when I visited one in Michigan I was hooked. Upon visiting it recently I found they increased their prices, shrunk down their already smaller menu, and decreased the size of their portions. I don't think I've ever wanted a business on Mill Ave to fail as bad as the Steak N Shake that is there now."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the burgers since I was a kid. But this year I found my favorite Steak 'n Shake milkshake (you know, for now...). I can't believe it has taken me this long to find the Peanut Butter Banana Milkshake."}
{"text":"9/21/2015 After leaving the Mac Miller concert, some friends and I decided to break for a bite to eat on our journey home. Inside we were seated and began waiting for almost 10 minutes. We were then approached by our less than competent waiter, Alonzo, who took our orders and then disappeared for almost 20 minutes. He then returned stating that there was no guacamole for the guacamole burger my friend had order. He provided no other suggestions or solutions to the order problem and then walked away. We received our food without ever getting our drinks, silver wear, or so much as a napkin. The restaurant was almost completely empty and the service felt very neglegant. Safe to say I was disappointed with my experience"}
{"text":"This is a review on just their coffee.  The coffee is bad. It has been burnt both times I have visited in the early mornings, despite my hope that the first time was an isolated incident. They sell the 'Seattle's Best' brand, which I would imagine is not inherently bad coffee, but something in their process is off, as it is not good coffee in my book: too burned and too bitter for how disappointingly not strong it is. Also, the coffee only comes in small cups. I wanted a 20 oz. jar of rocket fuel, but settled for 12 oz. of undrinkable ash.  Service was friendly and fairly fast. I could not bear to give this less than 2 stars based upon only reviewing one menu item, but if this was a coffeehouse serving this hot garbage, it would be a one star."}
{"text":"I've had Steak and Shake 4 times now and every experience has been different. First time was take out. You get less fries and milkshake seems smaller on your takeout order. My uncle stayed at South Point a while back and we dined in here. They give a decent amount of fries when dining in. I ordered a salad with Grilled chicken on it. I forgot which one it's called but it had a raspberry dressing. Sweet dressings aren't my thing but it was ok. I'd say come for the burgers not the salads because the burgers are better but it's nice to have healthy options as well. Last visit I ordered the Portabella steak burger and boyfriend had the jalapeño crunch. Let's just say his burger was way better than mine. There is always a wait here whether you're dining in or taking it to go.  Just steer clear of the ranch because its absolutely the nastiest ranch you will ever taste,but the milkshakes are to die for. Legit real milkshakes."}
{"text":"Boyfriend & I got 2 meals for $11.  That's about all I can say about this place. The food is basically fast food diner style. I probably would only go here if I wanted to be waited on. Or if I was 16 and wanted to go on a date (there were several cute little couples here, on Valentines day!)."}
{"text":"I was very surprise how I actually enjoyed Steak 'n Shake. The prices are reasonably cheap and the food is great. Waiting in line wasn't as long as I thought it would be and it was worth the wait.   Pro: You can't go wrong with burgers and shake!!! Price is great!!!  Con: You will have to wait in line, inside the Southpoint Casino. Smoking environment."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner. The staff is wonderful and knows us by name. Its like going to a friends house.:)  I went basic and ordered a single steakburger with cheese, cheese fries and a Dr. P."}
{"text":"OH H#LL NO!   I lived in indiana (home of the steak and shakes) and so I was pumped to get my fix. First off, I sat down with my grandma and sister in a booth. The waitress came over and looked at me and goes 'the tables move if you want to push it away\"....I was instantly pissed. So you officially called me fat indirectly. F&CK YOU! She was really rude and hard to understand throughout the visit. My grandma tried ordering the small  burgers and the waitress could not understand at all. finally my grandma got fed up and just pointed at one of the $4 meals and said she would do that.   The food was not up to the standards. The shake tasted like the ice cream had gone bad and they were using expired product. So lumpy and not in a good way. My sister and I both agreed they were horrible! The burger and fries were warm, not hot and fresh. I was so disappointed. Needless to say none of us left a tip for our server who provided horrible service. You expect me to tip you after you essentially call me fat?! NOPE!   My sister and I went and gave the place a second chance one late night after returning to the hotel. We did takeout this time. Well actually it was the third attempt, as we stood in line a different day but found that the line wasn't moving. We finally the third time got through the line and the food was a bit better, but not by much, the food was ok. I tried the chili fries...waste of money. Just stick with the fries. This place will stay in business because it is a big name and \"fast food\", but really i think everyone will be disappointed. It does not meet the standards of steak and shake and the staff is horrible!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time eating here and I swear it won't be my last. I got a simple burger w/fries and grabbed my 2 year old a grilled sandwich w/fries. Also grabbed a peanut butter milkshake. The milkshake was made so perfect. It wasn't strong or sweet. The taste was on point Everything we ate was amazing. I must admit, that is the best burger I have ever had. What was great is that I bought all this GOOD tasting food for under 12 bucks!!!  Customer services was great as well. Everyone was polite and courteous. I seen in the review that the place looked dirty. To me it didn't, it was kept clean. The floor might look dirty because it's old but everything was fine."}
{"text":"Waitress took forever to take our order. Party of 8. Waitress stood only at one end of the table, giving the people closest to her the orders to pass down to the others even though she could've easily walked to the other side of the table.   Food itself was surprisingly good. Restaurant was dirty all over-nasty & gross. My younger guy refused to sit in the chair because it was so dirty. I had to wipe it off. Thank God for Clorox wipes!   Waitress mopped the floor while we were eating leaving s strange chemical smell in the air again while we were eating. Then she put a \"wet floor\" sign behind a man sitting in s wheelchair, blocking him from being able to get out. The person with him had to get up and move it. Plus milkshakes took longer to get than the food itself!"}
{"text":"While Staying at the South Point Hotel/Casino my party and I decided to stop by here to eat after seeing the Ad on Billbaords all over Las Vegas.  Upon arriving we noticed there was a bit of a line jsut to go in, for a second I thought the Steak 'n Shake was night club and not a restaurant.  Surprisingly, the line went by pretty fast, and we were seated at our booth in a blink of an eye.  We looked at the Menu for a few minutes not know what to order as everything on the menu looked really good.  I finally made up my mind and decided to order the Cheesy Cheddar Steak Burger with a Peanut Butter Cup shake and an order of Bacon Cheese Fries.  My girlfriend ordered a Patty Melt with an order of Thin 'n Crispy Fries, and her nephew went with the 3 Shooters special and some fries.  Over all the food was really good, and decent service (Took them a while to bring the shake I ordered well after our food was served).  The customer service was pretty friendly.  I would definitley come back and try out some of their other Menu items on a future visit."}
{"text":"I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.  Long story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier."}
{"text":"GARBAGE PLACE wish I wasn't forced to give one star! worst experience one could imagine. I realize it's greasy fast food trash but the rubbish that works here strives to be the bottom of the barrel.  Drive through tenant his name was Shawn told us to \"look chill and hold up\" tonight as he gave free food to the car in front of us.    I come here probably one time a year and everything about this place sucks. Out of food, rude workers, Slow employees, and orders are always wrong.   We eventually told him to refund us and he demanded he wouldn't do it look at the pictures I added for photo evidence of this fool"}
{"text":"$4 for burger and fries -- BEST DEAL EVER. I'm a super fan. I love coming to South Point just to go to Steak 'n Shake right before hitting Vegas. The service is okay, but you get your food fast. The atmosphere is like Ruby's Diner and In n Out put together, haha. Try the $4 burgers and the shakes! It's definitely a steal!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and have mixed reviews on this visit. I had the Philly cheesesteak burger and fries and it was very good. I would recommend it and it's the only saving grace for this review. While our waitress was nice enough...I had asked her for vinegar and she said they don't have any. I find this hard to believe since steak and shake actually sells salt and vinegar fries. The food took forever to be made. Had we gone through the drive thru we could have gotten the same orders 3xs in the amount of time it took at our table. There was a female working at the register who saw us ready to check out and ignored us signaling a male cashier nearby to ring us out. Now I get maybe your shift was ending or you needed to go on break or whatever but bottom line, that just comes off rude. This steak and shake is a disappointment more than a pleasant experience. Make sure you have good company with you and have plenty of time to spare if you go there."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Steak n Shake's happy hour which is from 2-4 am and pm on weekdays.  They have half price shakes and drinks, which is a really good deal.  Unfortunately, this particular steak n shake can't make a good milkshake.  They always taste odd here (too much syrup or poorly blended?).  I've been here at least 3 times, and they're always bad.  So, now to satisfy my cravings I tend to drive up to the prospect one.    The food, on the other hand, is usually about your average steak n shake fare, so long as you stay away from the shakes, you might enjoy your experience (but who really would want to go to steak n shake and not get a shake?)."}
{"text":"When I found out about SNS being here in Tempe I couldn;t  wait to try it out. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I lived in Tampa for a few years and Steak N Shakes were everywhere. The restaurants there were sit down style where you actually got served at the table. The location here in Tempe on Mill barely resembles that. Its a bare bones menu. Food was average, seating was minimal and parking sucks. This location is pretty much targeting the ASU crowd. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am from Missouri, the land of Steak 'N Shake.  I was excited when they announced plans to open a restaurant in Vegas... I thought it would be a taste of home.  However, this is NO real Steak 'N Shake.  The food and service is very inconsistent.  I keep coming back and hoping it will be better, but sadly, it isn't.  Cold burgers and fries, watery shakes, rude waitresses..."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours and it has a huge list of items that are $4! That is simply awesome. Steak 'n Shake is a sit down restaurant that features fast food quality food. Their breakfast hours go from 6:00am to 11:00am and they serve bottomless pancakes for $4.   I had their double 'n cheese steakburger. The burger itself and the fries were slightly better than your standard fast food place. What really stood out to me was the Prince of Royale steakburger which includes bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. The fried egg comes out fresh and warm.   I ordered an oreo ice cream sandwich. Since it was $0.99, I was expecting it to be as small as an actual oreo cookie. I'm glad I was wrong. It's as big as a klondike bar and it's as delicious as it sounds; I'm quite surprised it was good considering it was obvious that they just took it out of the freezer. Lastly, the shakes are pretty darn good too and they have a handful of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"First timer at steak 'n shake! I personally love these types of old school classic American Burger restaurants and I was super excited to try this iconic restaurant. They're located inside the South Point Hotel, casino and spa in case you get lost coming here for the first time. If you get lost or need direction, just ask any of the security or workers and they will guide you.  I stopped by the restaurant around 2pm on a sunday and I there was about a 10 min wait time. The overall vibe is friendly and family orientated and its awesome for young and old alike. Absolutely a delight for family lunch. They have a great system going on for pick up orders as well.   The Steak n' Shake specialize in classic American burgers and shakes but they do offer other alternatives such as chilli and sandwiches if you are craving something else. I think it's pretty cool how conveniently located within the hotel and its close to the casino, theater and everything else. You can get a quick bite of food before a movie (which I did).    Plenty of waitress walking around and making sure you are well taken care of was good to see as well. Although when things are way too busy, there can be a bit of a delay.   I ordered the famous Royal burger w vanilla shake. I was tempted to try their \"prime burgers\" but I decided to stick to their classic style. The prime burger options will be great if you are higher quality burgers type of a person. I believe they were $3-4 more than their classic options.   Overall food was great and I have a find time dining in! Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time here stopped in on my way back into town and gotta say its pretty good. I don't know why I waited so long to try it out. Prices are unreal. Definitely Budget friendly."}
{"text":"Ever have one of those moments where the experience doesn't exactly live up to the hype? Unfortunately, that was Steak 'n Shake. Which is so sad, since I've enjoyed many a late night meal at Steak 'n Shake across IL and MO. And since Las Vegas is as far west as this diner chain reaches, was VERY excited to have a taste over the holidays.   Maybe it's because we actually dined in (vs. pickup or drive-thru)? Or maybe it's because this Steak 'n Shake is inside a casino? Or maybe it's because it was bright as hell inside? Something just didn't feel right.   (I was about to blame it on the clientele, but let's face it: Steak 'n Shake tends to attract the same type of customer no matter what part of the U.S. they're located. Overweight, loud, eating with their mouth open kind of people. Hey, it's cool, I'm from the Midwest!)  Was the double steakburger as good as I remembered? Pretty much. I will say that it tastes WAY better from the comfort of your own home. After a night of bar hopping, of course. I did appreciate the two sides of melted cheese for dipping fries. I only asked for one and was given a second... Yay to gluttony squared!  This particular location was extremely clean and well-lit, no complaints here. It just didn't feel like a slice of the real deal. But hey, that's why it's in Vegas!   Next time, I'm getting it to-go."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Stood around for at least 5 minutes waiting to be seated.  Saw waitresses just sitting around, while others chatted with each other.  Even after being seated, it took several minutes to be served.  Every Steak N Shake is like this."}
{"text":"The food here tastes great and the best thing about it would truly be the prices-- this is one of the lowest priced burger place I've seen by far yet the quality stays good. The only downside is that this is the only one in Vegas and it can get packed here sometimes causing a very long wait, but all in all it's worth it."}
{"text":"Worst service. I waited 10 minutes to be seated in a half full restaurant. Several servers walked by, but no one greeted me. Finally sat, waited 15 minutes and no one stopped at my table. I was seated next to the server station, so I could hear them talking. Lots of cussing and complaining. Someone asked \"who's going to wait on the fat guy sitting by himself?\" Looked around ... I'm the only single seat in the place, so ... ouch. Server finally came by, took my order, then went right to the wait station and started complaining loudly about how long she'd been working that day. Waited another ten minutes, but she never returned, even with my drink order ... just stood and griped. I watched two other tables get up and leave because NO ONE came to serve them. I finally gave up... the restaurant clearly doesn't want me as a customer. On the way out I tried to talk to the manager. Her response was \"I don't know why that happened.\""}
{"text":"Server was good but the kitchen sucked. 20 min for a chicken melt and a chilli Mac. Last time I will go to this location."}
{"text":"Actually kind of surprised this place has such low reviews, but I'd agree. Let's be honest, a lot of AZ and Cali natives don't know a good hamburger when they see one and hop onto the new hype easily, no offence! I'm from Chicago and we are all about keeping good food and service around in the Midwest!  I used to eat at SnS in Illinois pretty often, I liked that it was sit down and diner style. Kind of disturbed at this new trend of making nice quaint restaurants into impersonal fast food shacks. I had a plain burger and fries and my friend had some toppings on the burger with fries and a shake. I was kind of shocked at how mediocre the shake was, really disheartening. The burger seemed slightly undercooked and the bun was cold and soft/mushy... fries were average, not what I remember! They messed up our order 2x times and had to wait over 30min to get it right, thank goodness we had time or I be really p-oed. Actually found out they had forgotten about us as well (idk how that happens!).  I finished the burger cause I was starving by then but I couldn't finish the fries and that never happens! Ouch. Oh and by the way, it is most certainly NOT* the \"In n Out of the Midwest\". I like I-n-O alright but the actual SnS in the Midwest is a much higher supreme creation."}
{"text":"Steak 'n shake is always our go to for a quick bite right before a movie... which we are typically running late for so we love that we can have a great meal for under 25 bucks in under 30-45 minutes. This is our tried-and-true staple at the Southpoint on date night!"}
{"text":"Very cool burger and shake diner. Burgers are way smaller then in the pictures but with fries and a shake you don't need any more then a single. They are cooked on the flat top and are tasty."}
{"text":"This location is open 24/7, but don't even attempt to get service after 11 o'clock, we were just forgotten at the drive through window, served ridiculously slowly but asked to move up in order to decrease their drive through rate time, had to repeat our order an absurd amount of times. Although I must admit this shake is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. None of the tables are clean, there are straw wrappers on the floor. 30% of the lights are not working. It took 40 minutes for 2 burgers."}
{"text":"Great, well priced food and good service at the South Point hotel and casino.  Fast service.  Food was tasty and at a good price.  A little above what you would expect for a burger joint.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"If you have never had SnS before (like me), I would explain it as a cross between In N Out and Smashburger.  Too bad it doesn't outshine either IMO :(  The patties are flattened super thin and charred on the edges.  Even though I ordered the doubles, it looks (and fills you up) like a single elsewhere.  I tried the Western BBQ & Bacon ($4.99): Double Steakburger, American Cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fried Onions & BBQ Sauce. The burger patties are super thin, cripsy and delicious...just not that filling! Good price though.   Also tried a Cookies & Cream Milkshake ($3.49): Chunky Cookie Pieces & Whipped Cream. Good shake and good price. Don't expect extraordinary, and you will enjoy it!   It's probably better/cheaper than most other choices in Southpoint, but I wouldn't drive to come eat here specifically again...just not my kind of burger!  But if I do find myself here again, I'd be willing to spend my $10 bill happily :)"}
{"text":"What's not to like about a burger and a shake from a diner?    The prices are very reasonable and the food is good.  The only downside is that you will most likely wait in a long line for a table.  But luckily you are in a casino so you can gamble while one unlucky person has to hold your place in line.  Place doesn't really accommodate larger parties.  They have a few tables that can fit around 7-8 people, but any more you will have to split up.    Favorites: Very Berry Strawberry Smoothie & the Spicy Chipotle Burger"}
{"text":"I am sucking the gooey remainders of the hot fudge and caramel from my Turtle Nut Sippable Sundae off my spoon as I type this.  Steak n' Shake, I like your freshly made burgers and your tiny little baby fries and your ridiculously yummy shakes and sundaes, but what wins it for me is the fact that you are a) around the corner from my house and b) open late enough to accomodate my late-nite, mid 70-hour work week cravings.  Minus a star because I cannot resist you and that is how my pocketbook chooses to rebel."}
{"text":"Food's great and cheap like any other Steak 'n Shake - took a little longer than usual but I wasn't in a hurry. Good waitress"}
{"text":"Let me start off saying this is a review from about 6 months ago, but just now posting.  My family and I went here after Church for lunch, we typically like Steak and Shake and here we waited while servers passed a few times just to seat us then once we sat down we waited over 10 minutes and were ignored by the servers.  The place was not that busy but more people were coming in as time went by.  We ended up just getting up and walking out and haven't been back since and probably will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"First time at a Steak and Shake and the food was very good for hamburgers and fries. Saw some folks eating good looking salads. The prices are quite reasonable, especially for Vegas. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"The reviews already posted expecting cleanliness from a cross between a diner & a McDonald's are kind of funny.  You come to Steak 'n Shake for grease or cheap, and they deliver on both fronts.  Sadly the portions on fries & side salads have gone really down over the years.  One super plus if you have kids is that they eat free with an adult meal purchase on Saturday and Sunday... so we fed four people for $19.99 plus a tip this evening.  The waitress was quick with refills before we asked.  Oddly the place was out of silverware so we ate our cottage cheese with soup spoons and we had regular napkins instead of the ones usually rolled around the silverware.  No biggie.  Like I said, we're not expecting five star dining at Steak n' Shake."}
{"text":"The worst steaknshake ever!!! DO NOT go to this location. Super slow service. Employees (mostly ghetto - hint hint) could care less. But they still want their $15/hr."}
{"text":"The line is always long here - so may I suggest getting it to-go and finding a seat outside of the restaurant! Food is delicious and super cheap. Ordered the Royale Burger which is a cheeseburger with a fried egg and a side a fries for a whopping price of $5.95! Amazing! Tasted 100x better than McDonalds for less the cost! Also tried the Vanilla/Strawberry side by side milkshake. BOMB! Tons of flavors of shakes to try from, can't wait to go back and try the rest."}
{"text":"Extremely awful service. The management is a joke at this place. Customers satisfaction means nothing to them. Plus the workers stand in a circle and gossip like immature fools. Next time I'll just go to McDonalds, at least the food is cheaper."}
{"text":"The line was pretty long even in the lunch hours, so I couldn't wait to try the food. I have been to Steak 'n Shake many years ago, but I forgot how everything tasted. This was the first one for Vegas, and people were responding!  They had two different lines. One for dining and one for takeout. The shorter line was takeout, so that was my line lol. The wait for food wasn't long at all, and I was quite impressed since it was so busy.   Everyone almost in the restaurant had the signature hats on while they were dining.   The burger wasn't really good at all. I was sad because I had looked foward to this burger and the fries were really thin.   The shake I had was the best part! It was a side-by-side Strawberry Banana shake! That was really really good!   I will only go back for the shakes.."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We waited for over 15 minutes for two milkshakes and finally asked for money back. I will not recommend going to this steak and shake."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! My frisco burger was super delicious.. Prices are also very reasonable!  Highly recommended! Its a must"}
{"text":"The Burgers taste like in and out burgers and tehy are just as good. Great service and great attutude from everyone. Cheap to eat here with a good portion of what ever you order."}
{"text":"I had a burger there and it was very good. Nice atmosphere, nice and clean.  I would have like to stay and see the horses.  My husband got the 5 way I tasted a bite of it and it was very good."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night with 3 kids. They were obviously under staffed, but the workers kept their cool and did their best. The wait was long but the servers made sure the orders were correct brought to the table as soon as possible.   Our server Samantha was the hostess, server, bus and cashier all with a smile.   An hour for fast food that was served hot from from friendly servers.   Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"Its definitely really cheap in terms of price but so is the quality of the food. The service was amazing even at 11pm. Its opened 24 hours and reminds me of dennys but the food is definitely better.  I would choose in-and-out over this if I had the choice. Maybe I didn't order the right things, had a shake, a chicken burger, veggie burger and a melt. Nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"I walked in and immediately I was met with the smell of shit!! The floor was extremely greasy and dirty. The bathroom smelled horrendous with paper towels strewn all over the floor. All the other reviews are accurate about this place even though I didn't believe them when I first saw them before coming!!"}
{"text":"Last night, after the Kiss and Motley Crue concert at First Niagara Pavilion was but a memory, a friend and I were suffering from hollow stomachs. When we detrained from the shuttle bus in front of Buffalo Wild Wings, we found out that they were too close to closing time to serve us.   El Campesino was locked up for the night as well.   A hot tip from a passerby led us to Bocktown only to find that their kitchen was out of service also.  Robinson was barren, dark, lonely. We might as well have been Midwestern runaways lost in LA...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugu2ClSV5ew  Along the way to an Eat 'n Park as a last resort, we discovered a Steak 'n Shake that was open 24 hours!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb9Bb8lcTJw  The manager, nearly overwhelmed by fellow rockers/diners, was doubling as a server yet botched not one note. Our food did take a little longer than normal, and because of that, she was nice enough to give me a free Fudge Walnut Sundae, the treat serving as a textbook example of hot/cold, creamy/rich dynamics, the warmed-over brownie dumping Little Debbie onto the curb, the hot fudge atop it killing me with luxury, and the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream toning the sweetness and heat down a notch. This is why I can't stop ordering brownie sundaes at restaurants.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJruk2KcDyY  The shoestring fries were of course ideal, salted yellow twigs of deep-fried love and were hot, hot...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cluy2j6VGZ4  My Frankenstein Monster of a burger included bacon, avocado, their secret Frisco Sauce, a fried egg, and Wisconsin butter upon request. Moist as a poundcake, thicker and hotter than a plus-sized model, and juicier as a watermelon, it took me to the...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nm1BJPe-pg  And our total for 2 meals was $16 and change. Affordability, open-all-night hours, exemplary fast-food, drive-thru options, scintillating 50's decor, a sizeable menu, great service...   I'm sorry, people. S 'n S gives me...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2XWXsKmlSI"}
{"text":"After using a $15 gift card here on Sunday, Steak N Shake and I are officially friends.  The Guacamole Steakburger, which the fine people at S N S allowed me to customize with fried egg, bacon, and their most excellent Frisco *ahem 1,000 island ahem* sauce that ended up being used as a dipper for the order of ace shoestring fries, is an achievement of fast food, matching the Redhead in price and surpassing her in flavor.   At S N S, one can watch the globular chopped steak being pressed onto the flatiron grill and thus see for themselves how French-style is the dark horse way to prepare burgers. The edges blacken and crisp, but the internals never lose their fatty, tasteful moisture.   The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is willing to take on all ice cream shoppe comers with its ideally baked discoids of dough.  S N S prepares a better burger than many independent restaurants, including such local disappointments as Redbeard's. I am willing to risk imprisonment for stating that.  S N S also offers a Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae that again trumped a non-chain, this being the nightmarish failure sold by The Shiloh Grill.   Furthermore, the service was stellar, something cannot say about every indie, and that means YOU Shiloh Grill and Redbeard's. When our server sensed that I wasn't mad about my Cherry Limeade (the syrup fell to the bottom), she immediately brought me another soft drink with a beautiful smile on her rosy lips.   Shoot me, flog me, taser me, bar me from Yelp for eternity, Steak N Shake is everything fast food can be and more. It's fresh, highly edible, very affordable, and served up quick. The decor is dynamically retro and therefore a blast. And this one even has drive-thru as well as late hours!   I'm sorry, Corporate won this weekend."}
{"text":"Can't beat the shakes"}
{"text":"Tom Cressman the manger of this place really disgusts me he was very rude to my fiancé and me they just through my food in the bag I'll never come here again I'm so disgusted with this place!!! I tried to give my food back because it was just thrown in the bag and made all the way wrong and get a refund and he yelled and my fiancé's face I do not give cash refunds have a nice day this guy and this place beneath me. Tom Cressman what a fucking joke this guy is."}
{"text":"I got a number 15 and waited 15 minutes for the worse burger I ever had. The meat was cold and had holes in it so you could see the bacon on the other side. The hamburger bun was wet and soggy. The french fries were cold and greasy. The manager at the window had a nonchalant attitude."}
{"text":"Came in a few days ago with the family and had an great experience dining in, tonight on the other hand we did drive through after a date night and service was slow, staff was drinking milkshakes while dancing in front of the drive through window, and not paying attention to what was going on. Had someone give us our shakes but offered them to us free as he kept stating that the other girl was messing with him and he didn't know who the shakes were for or who was waiting for what. I suggest you dine-in if you want to try them out as the drive through was a joke."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake is one of those places you go when you want a burger or shake and you're not worried about your diet. Their menu is built around beef, but they have a handful of chicken options. In fact, I always get the chicken melt. Their shakes are full fledged desserts.   The only problem I've ever had at this particular location is long wait times and poor service. However, Brandon, our server today, was phenomenal. He was attentive and friendly, our order came quickly and was accurate. We could not have been more pleased.   I'm not sure if there is a specific time of day when they are better staffed. Today, we were there during the afternoon (2:30ish) when they are typically pretty busy. Maybe this is the best time of day. Or maybe Brandon is just a great server. Regardless, today's visit was great and we'll be back soon.   Why not 5 stars? I reserve 5 star ratings for local/regional (3 or fewer) establishments whose products or services are unique and memorable. Steak and shake is a national franchise, so it doesn't qualify. I gave it the highest score I would typically award for a national franchise. I will amend the score if future experiences are significantly different.   PS - try the Nutella shake!"}
{"text":"Well I will be honest... the only thing I have ever gone for is the happy hour milkshakes.. which are honestly delicious for the price. I love the peanut butter banana. And you can't beat 1.75$ I have always received good service and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I had one of the best milkshakes of my life at this location. IT WAS SO GOOD. Maybe I just was there at the right day or something... but it was thick and delicious and full of all the good stuff I wanted. AND SO CHEAP. I mean.. happy hour is a dream come true."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this but I really had a bad experience here today. I decided to go inside to place my order...3 shakes and large fries. 20 minutes later I finally got my shakes but no fries. I tried 4 times to get someone's attention only to be ignored. If it wasn't for another woman sitting at the counter (I think someone's girlfriend) I don't think I would have been listened to. Thank you whoever you were...all of that being said I would not recommend this Steak n Shake to anyone."}
{"text":"I love that they are open when I get off my late night shift but over the last 4 visits I've asked for a milkshake no cherry due to allergies. And Everytime I get a cherry I know it's late at night and working in the restaurant industry myself it can get stressful but a food allergy is serious stuff"}
{"text":"My experience at Steak and Shake was pretty awful...  First time we went through the drive thru and ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries, and one soda. The drive thru took SO LONG. From ordering our food to getting our food brought to us, took 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES!! We actually didn't even get our food at the window; we were told to drive forward in front of the restaurant and someone eventually ran our food out to us and apologized for the slow service as she was the only employee working... That probably should be fixed. Why even have a drive thru if it's going to take so long?  The food was alright... Nothing special but decently good for the price."}
{"text":"Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"I have always liked making a stop at this place while at South Point Casino. Good food, friendly staff and a fun environment. I love that they have the options of different flavored fries. And mmmmm the chili is great as well. I will be back again when in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Other than the food this was the worst stake and shake I've been to. Our orders came back all wrong and burgers were dry and it took over an hour to get all our food. Our original waiter had switched tables so that he could wait on a couple of good looking girls and our new waiter had no idea what he was doing. I'll never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great steak burgers and fast service. My two kids had the shooters (3 mini burgers), my husband had the guacamole burger and I had the one with the egg on top!  Yummmm. I was nervous because we had a half hour before our movie started but our waitress was great. Only downfall was that we didn't get to finish our thick delicious milkshakes because the movie theater wouldn't let us bring them in. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I love eating here ! The portions are just right , if you know u eat a lot then don't hesitate to order an extra order. I usually order one order for lunch and for dinner, I always get two orders. The milkshakes are huge and the food for kids are pretty big of a portion and they don't even cost over $3.00 ! I recommend this place to those who have kids. And remember that happy hour is from 2-5am/pm weekdays which you get 1/2 off on your milkshakes . I took one star off because I just hate when you walk in and even when the people who works there sees you but they don't bother to greet you or tell you someone will be with you and the service could be a bit better ."}
{"text":"Look so many better burgers. Aint no steak and no shake. Ice milk at best. Five guy burgers much better. Frosty and a daves classic much better at same price. Spend a few more and goto bgr"}
{"text":"This place is SO GROSS! I was sitting in a booth next to the wall, and there were fingerprints of ketchup smeared all over next to my head. Our waitress was sweet, but when my son ordered a PLAIN hamburger, \"nothing but burger and bun,\" it came with cheese (he can't eat cheese.) It took a LONG time to get the re-made burger. I ordered my grilled chicken salad with no cheese either. It came covered in shredded cheese. I sent it back, and when it returned, the chicken on it was inedible. It was ALL FAT, GRISTLE and tasted awful. They STILL made me pay for it, and didn't apologize. The manager was too busy to come over and talk to me about it.   We will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"I somewhat liked this place. It had every kind of milkshake ever which was cool because as you all know, I have a massive sweet tooth! Any they also had HUGE Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches! So you I definitely ordered that bad boy!  Anyways, the shakes were good, the ice cream was good, the fries were okay but they were wayyy too small and dinky! I love me some french fries but definitely not from here. The burgers were okay. They were kind of small but they were juicy but not the juicy where it starts dripping everywhere.  I am definitely a fan of this place, but not with the small burgers and tiny ass french fries!"}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed the Original burger, but it needed more than just ketchup. And the caramelized onions are a must I asked for the pattimelt sauce which helped. I was slightly disappointed after hearing good things, because it didn't seem like anything special but the burger was tasty and A+ on their fries."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 min and no one came over so i left. Slowest moving staff ive ever seen. Atleast 4 different servers walked or more like strolled by  like 10x each"}
{"text":"We love steak and shake, especially the Wisconsin burger, with all the butter.  MMMMmmmmmmmMM.  In fact, when we moved to Oregon, we made it our number one meal to come back to enjoy.  However...  While the food is yummy, and so not good for you, which makes it even better-- I have never been there when the service was good.  In fact, I left zero tip last time, which as a person who spent 25 years in Vegas, is unheard of!    The shakes never come until after you have had your meal for some time.  This leaves you nothing to drink as you start to eat.  The shakes should be easy and quick, they require no cooking!  Then, the waitress leaves you --but never comes back.  On top of that, she won't take your credit card, you have to go STAND IN LINE--because really, that is what we all love to do at a restaurant, right?  So if they could improve service, this would be a five star.  I wish there was one in Oregon :("}
{"text":"This is the first time ever that I tried out Steak N Shake, and it really isn't all that. The portioning is small and it is not worth the $7 combo price. I'm not sure if it is because they're under UNLV but their prices is not worth your quantity of food you receive. I got the Portobello sandwich combo (only comes with sandwich and fries) the drink is sold separately. There were about four people working and there wasn't a line, it took about 10 minutes for them to complete my order. The fries were a bit dry and the burger was good, wish it was bigger though! I think you're better off walking to In N Out next door if you're trying to make your monies worth and leave full/ satisfied."}
{"text":"Food good, not amazing. Shake is alright, it did come way later than we expected. I would've gave 3 stars however there is not a worker in sight with a smile or personality. I will probably not return here at all."}
{"text":"You cannot get better value for your money at any place in Champaign. True the floors are not clean and there are times you wonder why it is taking so long to get the food. By the way how does a place like this have such good guacamole? Who knows. Make sure you tip more than 20% because if you get a $4 meal don't be leaving an 80 cent tip!"}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there."}
{"text":"Chili is awful and service was very slow they started waiting on large table beforeus and we got here 10 min before ..... the shakes were awesome"}
{"text":"Not bad.. I didn't try their famous chili burger. I had a plain single burger with an ultimate banana shake - Meh. Nothing spectacular, but I did appreciate real ice cream for the milk shake. The line seemed to go on forever but the wait was 15min. Service was good. Good place for family get together."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat but took my kids here for a quick lunch. I have to give them 5 stars for the attention received when an allergy was mentioned. Even the manager came out to discuss it. I was very impressed with that. Good job steak and shake for caring."}
{"text":"When I think of Steak 'n Shake I think of what should be a pleasant experience.   For starters the person that took the order was not very friendly. She seemed more preoccupied with texting on her cell phone than serving customers. I ordered a burger combo.   The burger had good flavor and was loaded. However the fries were very cold and skimpy. The drink machine was not working properly because the choices were either out or not serviceable. Overall the place could have been a bit more clean. The tables were dirty and not wiped down in some time.   Other customers next to us expressed they were not happy with the quality of food received. It seemed to set the tone overall of this particular place.   The prices seem reasonable but should be reflective of the product. On this occasion it was not. This is not what I would expect from Steak 'n Shake. Perhaps another location may be suggested."}
{"text":"I love the food and shakes. The half price happy hour cannot be matched and the new breakfast options are decent as well. Can't beat the prices and quality and being open 24/7 is convenient.  Cheddar burger and the southwest burger are delicious and every kind of shake is great.  However this location suffers from bad service and incompetent employees. there is also a lock attached to one of the lights. Still good enough for 4 stars."}
{"text":"First, we had the sweetest waitress and this place can be a madhouse, so I really appreciated her. Been to Steak and Shake in the south, its standard fare, but I did have the best chicken sandwich there!!  Fries and rings were good too. This is a great place to eat in the casino for cheap - they have an under $4 menu. Hit it up after the rush hours and you will get a decent burger. Lets face it, you are pretty much stuck at South Pointe, so make the most of it."}
{"text":"Meh.         I had heard good things, went there for lunch one day and was not impressed. Burger was not even as good as In N Out, my baseline for good cheap burgers. The shake was \"better,\" but not great. Again, In N Out is my baseline, and there biggest flaw is their weird shakes. Smashburger, Habit, Five Guys, BurgerFi all out do Steak n Shake in the shake and burger front."}
{"text":"They would not accept our gift cards because they won't use the app. The menu is short and doesn't have the usual items like other Steak and shakes do. Everything is more expensive than a regular S&S. There are no discounts for emailed coupons from the company. The food and shakes weren't as good. It's crowded and smokey smelling from the casino. I will NEVER go to this location again."}
{"text":"Ok, there is one thing I have to say about this place. It has food that makes you full. It has staff that serves this filling food it has seats to sit in when you feeling parched from the warm summer weather and drinks to help so called parched feeling go away. The milk shakes are a little to milky in my opinion but hell who am I judge a milkshake in its own glory! All in all it was an experience I'll always forget. Thank you amped shirtless man in the back of the restaurant trying to boast your jingles! For that we thank you!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place received a three from me is due to the food. The service is comically bad, from terrible waitstaff,  being told there would be a twenty minute wait while in the drive thru (after waiting twenty minutes i was told it would be twenty more), order mix ups, the list goes on and on.   There have been a few times where i have brought my guests there for dinner and left ashamed of the service they provided. I love the food but everything else...wow. I think I'll take my money elsewhere until they get it together."}
{"text":"Steak burgers are amazing. The steak is perfectly seasoned. Patties are flavorful. Burger combo is $6. Shakes are great"}
{"text":"Many people have told me to be weary of this SnS as its not a true representation of what Midwesterners know and love. I didn't want to believe it until trying so for myself. They're speaking the truth, sadly. The SnS this Midwesterner knows & lives is not what is in AZ. Their HQ is in downtown Indianapolis, so I've grown up with this place.   The getup from the getgo is nothing like a normal Steak n Shake - you have to order from a cashier even if dining in. It's also not that classic black & white diner with red accents. Straight up futuristic-ish with red walls and weird tables/seating. The employees here don't wear the bowtie & paper cap -- they wear shirts that make them look like they're part of Graham Rahal's racing team. If you look at the menu, you'll notice many things off the regular SnS menu are missing - primarily all Chili Mac's, Orange Freeze, many shake flavors, and the turkey club. I was super excited to find my Frisco Melt on the menu, but disappointed with the taste - the meat is different, and there wasn't nearly enough Frisco Sauce on the sandwich. I've grown up to expect it dripping out from all 4 sides, and it was just a light splash. The fries are a little different - slightly saltier - but mostly similar.   I seriously hope that SnS management will find lots of land soon for a REAL, AUTHENTIC SnS consistent with the Midwest so the good people of AZ don't have to bear with the pathetic excuse for one on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Fun 50's style diner. Clean and friendly. Bustling on a Sunday afternoon. I won't over qualify the food, it is what it is. They do try to be \"creative\" and offer a twist on the norm for some selections. Nice family atmosphere and a good option if you have small children. But, you won't be eating particularly healthy. The staff is friendly and there are lot's of options on the menu.  Just enjoy it for it's own merit."}
{"text":"Rode the light rail to Mill Ave. We had already eaten lunch, but Steak 'n Shakes are few & far between on this side of the country, so we had to stop in for some fries. Ordered our fries & iced teas on the kiosk (fun)! Tasty fries... wish we hadn't already eaten. Would've liked to try a burger. Next time..."}
{"text":"Our family went while staying across the street at the Grandview. It was a group of 13 and took foreverrr to be seated and then while seated we had to go into 2 separate booths because they do not put tables together there. Burger was good but small. I had the mushroom/swiss burger and the mushrooms were hardly in there. But it was still tasty. I wasn't a fan of their fries they were kind of thin and bland. I ordered the Banana shake I think the Ultimate Banana is what its called and that was delish!! sooo good. they have a TON of choices for the shakes. That was my highlight."}
{"text":"As a native St. Louisan, I was very excited about SnS opening up in Tempe. But I have to say I was so very disappointed. The burger was mediocre at best, the bottom bun was soggy, the fries were different that I remember and also cold, but I was majorly bummed that I couldn't get the pickle relish, the mgr said they did away with that years ago. Huh? The relish is one thing that makes SnS unique! And no chili-mac?! Sad. The ambiance was not typical, it was more hip and trendy, trying to cater to the ASU crowd I'm sure. Overall, I have to say it was not the visit I hoped for or expected. Just a thought: if you're going to bring SnS to the Valley, bring the WHOLE experience as is, don't try to tweak it to be something we already have enough of."}
{"text":"Perhaps think the diner from Happy Days. Don't know it, google please! Jukebox music, bright, clean and always friendly, attentive service.  I've had by far better service here than some of the better restaurants in this town. Clean cut staff, and they wear hairnets.  Shakes, ohhhh they have those and they will gladly split them for you if you ask! Tasty, quite tasty indeed!   Don't have a favorite, can't recommend just one. All are equally scrumptious! This go around I ordered the party melt, sourdough bread, grilled onions and mushrooms WITH Swiss cheese.  I prefer this over American;) Come hungry. Order a sandwich, shake (don't share)!  Even the vegetable soup is my staple.  Always fresh ingredients and the kitchen it quick, comes out ASAP and hot! Yes, they have salads.  Order one and offset the guilt of that shake- ha! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"i heard a lot of people tell me that this was the place to go for a burger...i got a good first impression because there was a line about 15 people deep in front of me and my family so i thought it must be true...didnt wait long to sit and i could tell the server was busy but i didnt mind...each ordered something different. i went for the bacon cheeseburger. was good but great. had better. the problem was with the service..we didnt get our shakes until my last bite left of my burger..and it wasnt anything that i havent had at my house making myself. only time i saw my server after he took the order was when i had to flag him down to ask about our shakes. now i wasnt expecting great service or anything but i at least expected getting what i ordered before i was done. dont think i will go back."}
{"text":"Frisco Melts are Frisco Melts.  Don't get me wrong, they're my favorite, but there is nothing better about them here than any other Steak N Shake location.  The food is pretty standard, but okay.  Greasy and delicious.  I've just had some poor experiences here.  A few times we've had shakes that taste like soap.  Not appetizing.  At least we know they wash the glasses.  Service is okay, but nothing to write home about.  There is just something very ordinary about this location.  As long as you're not expecting anything special, you'll be alright here."}
{"text":"Stopped by Steak n Shake after my daughter's volleyball practice because she was starving, there wasn't any food prepared at home, and it was getting late. She ordered a double cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake. I ordered a double with the works.  We had to wait five minutes for them to cook the food. My burger was hot, juicy, and tasted excellent with all the fresh toppings. It had tomato, lettuce, cheese, and onions. I loved it. I don't eat here often, but I should."}
{"text":"Do not order take out! These geniuses put all take out tickets with dine in tickets. We ended up waiting 40 mintues to order! When we got our sandwiches 15 minutes later, the sliders were ice cold, the fries were old and not hot and my patty melt was luke warm at best. MilkShake was damn good though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger spots I wish we could get on in LA there burgers are so freaking tasty I first tried steak n shake in Atlanta Georgia but during my last trip to Vegas I found This location and it was Just as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review applies ONLY to the Steak 'n Shake in Tempe, AZ.  The reason I want to make that clear is I grew up on Steak 'n Shake in the Midwest in my college days and this is certainly much more gol dang fancier than what they have in the Midwest.  Take into account that this is in the high rent district of Tempe ... no free parking lot so be prepared to add $2 to your meal if this is the only place you're going that day.  The place is kinda urban chic upscale with a nice but small outdoor dining area and a very tiny indoor seating area.  They serve beer and wine but they underplay it so much I didn't know it until I was waiting for my food.  And waiting.  And waiting.  I also counted 3,736 holes in the ceiling tile and watched 196 Volkswagen Beetles pass by the restaurant before FINALLY getting my burger and fries.  There is no way I would ever call this a \"fast food\" restaurant.  And this, mind you, was about 3 PM on a Monday afternoon with only about 20 people in the entire restaurant. Was it worth the wait?  Remember I practically grew up on real Steak 'n Shake drive-ins in the Midwest.  Well ... their standard burger, some fries and their only-sized drink came to just under $6.00 and the fries were awesome.  Me who is not the biggest fan of fries ate most of them before even digging in to the burger.  The soft drink was per usual with the exception that I had no way of figuring out how to use their fancy-dancy soda dispensers so I drank the whole thing without any ice in it.  Come on, get with the program and at least put some sort of label on the machine, huh?  Now, to the critical moment, the burger.  I am SUCH a reverse burger snob.  To me the best burgers I have had in my lifetime are in one-location greasy dives in bum-frick nowhere where it is burger meets bun with maybe some mustard and real cheese in-between and no rabbit food anywhere in sight.  You know, where you can actually taste the meat?  Apparently you can NOT have it your way at this burger joint, you get it with a bunch of toppings they think is the way you want it.    Sadly, I never felt I was sinking my teeth into a meat patty.  I tasted bun. I tasted lettuce (too much).  I tasted pickle. I tasted tomato. I tasted onion. But I tasted no meat nor cheese.  And I did taste something oddly weird and chemically and unsettling.  I have no idea what it was but it just didn't taste \"good\".  It distracted so much from the wonderful taste of a great/good/adequate hamburger I just had to take away two full stars from this Steak 'n Shake just for that reason.  I SO wanted to report that I fell in love with their Tempe location and that I'll be back 1,000 times in the future but after today I must review them more as an old familiar friend that I revisited and saw how they've changed and realized I really don't have much in common with them anymore.  NOTABLES:  * ONE freakin' counter person and a long line?  Um, has this franchisee ever been to any fast food restaurant, anywhere, ever?  Never in my life have I seen only one cashier in a burger joint. * Trash cans that are impossible to dump the contents of the super-deep trays in to?  So people don't and the trash cans are smeared with mustard and ketchup and the super-deep trays are just left unemptied. * A strategically placed 5\" diameter steel railing placed, you guessed it, exactly at eye-level around the outdoor dining area so it is impossible to view the surrounding street life.  WHO came up with that?  S/he is SOOOOO fired. * Employees with the fire and enthusiasm of mortuary workers.  WTF, this is a college town and you can't find even one worker who knows how to smile?"}
{"text":"....well...the service was great..but...the french fries were the worst I have EVER had...brutal...and the shakes tasted like they have been made from ice milk...when all the national hamburger chains have stepped up their game with shakes this is a brutal misake by SNS...so why the long lines...the food is cheap for a big hotel...(and yes as others have said the food was served cold...)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Steak 'n Shake...  I use to love coming here to get my burger fix. I haven't been here in about 2 years and honestly was disappointed for the first time. Surprisingly, they weren't as busy as I'm use to them being. I ordered my usually Frisco Patty Melt. Sadly, it was poorly assembled and lacked flavor. When they buttered the toast I think they did it a bit and it overpowered the whole sandwich. It was also very soggy. Very disappointing overall on my sandwich. My Husband ordered some bacon burger which looked delicious and my Son ordered the small sliders. We also ordered their strawberry shake which arrived towards the end of the meal. Super late! It wasn't as good as I remember. Seemed to be made with strawberry syrup vs real strawberry. Staff was also not the best. Our server came to our table and not even a hello. The hostess couldn't break a smile. The cashier was a ditz.   I don't know what happened the past two years, but whatever it was it's no good. Steak 'n Shake has declined big time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I don't know if the food or the service is good or not. We left. I was thinking led by the guy doing the hiring for this location that it was going to be a full menu restaurant. It's not. They don't even have the baked beans Steak N Shake is known for back east. Shame on you Mr hiring guy. You lied. Or wasn't knowledgeable enough to be doing the hiring."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes in the drive through, then recived cold food and the wrong shake.  Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I can count with one hand the times I've been to a Steak n Shake. Everything is just super salty, greasy and blah. I'd wake up the next day with a huge zit on my face from all the nasty grease.  I've tried a burger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries and Parmesan herb fries = salty, greasy and blah. Not worth the calories even for a cheat meal.   The only saving grace is their milkshake. But how hard is it to make a good milkshake? Flush away all the bad food from my system! $15 for a bad burger/sandwich, bad fries and a milkshake? You might want to go somewhere else for better quality burger and fries for less or pay extra for better quality burger and fries."}
{"text":"Friday night after football is not a good time to be here. Take way too long when all we ordered was milkshakes!! Then it was more like 2 tall glasses of milk (very little shake). I would send it back but the servers don't appear to be happy tonight.  My Carmel Apple Shake was missimg the carmel! Where they do that at? I was gonna give this place 2 stars but then that would be some credit, so 1 will do the trick."}
{"text":"Located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino is the much famed Steak and Shake. This was the best value foodwise that we had in Las Vegas. Their burgers are very inexpensive and very delicious. The overall atmosphere is that of a 1950s soda and burger shoppe. Delicious and juicy burgers and thin and crispy fries. Service was prompted and courteous as well. I didn't get a shake or malt this time but when I go to one of these places locally I see a chocolate malt in my future. So if you want a good burger but don't want to spend a ton of money then check out Steak and Shake! You will be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The service is not always at its best, but they are generally very quick with getting the orders out. The fact that you can order to go separately from the resteraunt is a major plus as well."}
{"text":"Food was good. We always love steak n shake. But we didn't get our extra fries. Server brought us the receipt. Showed as 21.76 for the total but then brought us a different receipt after bringing out the extra fries that he admitted he forgot to put in. New total was 19.78. It didn't have the fries on it so we assumed that he had taken them off to compensate for the time we had to wait for the rest of our order. So we left a nice tip and made sure to thank him. Got up to the register and she scanned in the receipt to pay and it rang up for the 21.76. I understand that this was what we got and we paid but what a shitty move. Then the girl that cashed us out pretty much blew off our issue. The fact of the matter is whether it's off 2 cents or 30 bucks, the check was different than what we were presented with. And after we paid she took off while I'm putting the change in my purse without giving me a receipt to show what I actually paid. I had to flag down one of the cooks to ask if someone could produce me a receipt. He's response: We don't give receipts on cash purchases. This is not the first steak n shake I've been too.  I know that's bs. And you don't walk away from a customer like that regardless of it being a cash transaction or not. Totally disappointed and will make sure to never stop at this location on trips back through. There's plenty of other restaurants who can have our business."}
{"text":"Steak and Shake, the In & Out Burger of the Midwest.  Only Con about this S&S, its too new, its crazy how hi-tech this place is and its funny how everyone working looks like they should be in a Steak & Shake Barbie Commerical.   Selling Burgers not MAC products.  Other than that, you should see me here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I have previously enjoyed Steak 'N' Shake while in the Midwest, so I was happy when they opened a Vegas location.  I finally got around to trying it.  Luckily, I got there around 11pm on a Monday night and it was pretty empty, so I did not have to wait to be seated and the service was very fast.  I ordered the Original Double Cheeseburger and fries, which surprisingly, is still only $3.99.  This is truly a bargain, especially considering it is full-service restaurant.  The burger was decent, with their signature crispy edges.  The fries, however, seemed almost stale, even though they were served hot.  Overall, it is good option for super cheap eats when at South Point, but I would not go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"The burger I got was something really simple - two burger patties with grilled onions and Wisconsin butter. The butter totally melted through the bottom bun so it got sickening over bit.  The Straw-nilla shake is super yummy though. I'm not sure if it's something spectacular but somehow that first sip it definitely got me wanting more. I think they use Blue Bunny ice cream - not sure if that makes a difference.   I'll take my friends here if they don't have it in their hometown because it appears on the list of \"20 chains that should be in every state\" but if not, I'm not sure I'll be back for a while."}
{"text":"Went in today because I've eaten at the one in Vegas and enjoyed it. This one is not so good. The menu is tiny and the food was pretty mediocre. Service was pretty good but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a serious misconception about Steak and Shake. I thought it was on the scale of Johnny Rockets which is kinda pricey. But its not. They have Meals for 4 dollars. And My meal with the shake was under 10. The Burger came out Juicy and fresh. Fast Service and friendly employees. The only thing i regret was not ordering dessert but there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Good food for good price. Unique in the sense that it is a fast food restaurant that resembles a diner inside, and also has waitresses, servers, etc.  Your best bet is to order the food through the drive-through. You'll save yourself the pain of sitting in a dirty restaurant that smells sour. I'll admit I can be a snob, and also you shouldn't be expecting too much from a fast food restaurant. However, I was under the impression, given that they do have servers and such, that the restaurant would be cleaner. We walked in at 3pm on a Thursday. There were maybe 3-4 other families in there, but the place was at most 1/4 full. There is no reason that the lady who brought us to our table had to tell us that she's trying to find a clean table for us to sit in. Most of the tables were unwiped, food on the floor, silverware was cheap and dirty (I had to eat the burger uncut in half because I was afraid of using their utensils). Also, while eating, some guy came and started wiping the windows around us.   Food was decent. Would come here again except this time, sticking to the drive-through. No wonder there were so many cars lined up outside but barely anyone inside.   One last note, try their milkshake at happy hour. Great deal! Half off making it 1.99$ for a huge huge shake."}
{"text":"I liked it. I don't know what these other guys are talking about.  Ordered in, got my food in reasonable time, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Service is bad even at night, managers a wanna be hard ass, and the burger was not that great"}
{"text":"Service is soooooo slow, im currently sitting in the restaurant and its so slow even the drinks took like 20 minutes, it just cane im bouta eat now"}
{"text":"Paper thin burgers, horrendous service and lackluster everything else. I've stayed at SouthPoint several times, and all of the restaurants are good, with one notable exception - Steak and Shake. I guess this is some kind of chain, but I don't see where they get off using the word 'steak' to describe anything about the food. The service is equally bad. To sum things up, just stay away!  Let's start with service. Hostess was rude, took us to a table, we requested a booth instead (2 were open), her response was \"you should've told me before!\" There was no sign and she should have asked or at least tried to accommodate us... So we sat at the table and finally got service (it took a good while - honestly I didn't count/clock it). After being asked to repeat ourselves, the server went off to place the order. The whole staff seemed downtrodden with the exception of the register attendant, who asked me if everything was to my liking, but I couldn't break it to her...   Food... Paper-thin, overdone patty; decent veggies; bun was soggy... Just too gross to eat. Fries were also soggy and underdone, but ok to eat. I also had a milkshake that almost passed as decent except for the strange whip cream and cherry job. The cherry was flattened and whip cream was strangely distributed. Looked like a 5 year old made it. I've had better at fast food chains. My partner had a chicken salad which looked good - I'd get that if forced to go back.  Atmosphere... Lots of screaming children. If you like Johnny rockets, you might like the decor. Mostly clean. Downtrodden staff.  The food is relatively cheap, but it's just bad. If you want something cheap, there's a hot dog cart on the casino floor that sells 75 cent hit dogs. Coronado cafe is also a better option; spend a little extra, get so much more! If you're feeling nostalgic, get the hot dog anyway because the food here is gross, the staff was either rude or downtrodden, and tons of screaming children. Just 'NO!'"}
{"text":"I visit this establishment frequently and the quality is always the same you get the best fresh sandwich or hamburger whatever you want to call it for your money rather than to go to someplace like red Robin or Chili's or meatheads or somebody the charges $10 for a hamburger you can do the same thing and walk out of steak and shake after eating a burger fries and a drink for $10 and not spend 25 or $30 and get poor service like you do in the restaurants like red Robin for one there of the worst I don't expect them to last in the city and meatheads is good but it's overpriced but if you want the best bang for your buck go to steak and shake and they even have a good breakfast to."}
{"text":"Barley saw manager on shift. Employees were overworking to basically work for this manager. Busy after a big table had showed up. Almost here for an hour for how long our food took, only 2 people at that. Like the food, but they didn't even get that right when we ordered."}
{"text":"My advice to this steak and shake is to hire happier people! There's this one girl in particular that always grunts and moans when we role around at 3 a.m. when they are open 24/7. She's rude and makes us feel uncomfortable, definitely would get rid of. Bad service."}
{"text":"I wanted to add a tip not a review, the shakes are half off between 2-4 Monday through Friday.   The shakes look so good, while I was at the machines.  I didn't realize it was happy hour.  Someone told me they got four shakes for 7.50."}
{"text":"So for all the years I had to hear how great this place is from family and business friends I finally went down to check it out.  Go for the shakes, don't go for anything else.  I know this is nothing like the ones east of Arizona but they really need to tell people that the amazing menu online is nothing like what you see when you come to this Mill Ave location. This limited menu is a dissappointment compared to the real Steal N Shakes.  As for the service ALOT of bad things going on down there as other reviews have stated. The trash cans are just plain stupid. The fact that the employees don't care about their jobs show and the amazingly stupid 2 buzzer system means this place will close in time. I watched everyone get their drinks in 5-10 minutes then wait 10-20 minutes to get their food.   The shakes are great. The one thing they got right. The burgers and fries ? Um why ? The fries are greasy the burgers are tasteless.  Overall  would only go back for the shakes and then would walk down to Jack in the Box for burgers that are better.  They need to re-think this location and would be better off opening a full steak n shake with a driv-thru and full menu plus get a staff that cares about their jobs."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake.       We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in.       I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is \"I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here.\" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.      After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are \"backed up inside\", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled \"are you getting paid for this?\" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.      We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away."}
{"text":"I come here for the shakes & love their double chocolate fudge shake! AMAAAZIINGGGGG! I mean I could finish two of them, or three, or even TEN! Why haven't I had them before?  oh, thats right the LOOONG Lines & the not-so great burgers.  The shake itself is wonderful but the steak burger not so much, it is VERY dry and does not have much taste to it.  I wish it tasted better & i would have been coming here ALL THE TIME.  The service is sub-par, it is almost like a diner but fast-food joint.   I would have given it a two-star, but their shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Unreal service, employees all had bad attitudes, told the waiter the drink wasn't what was order so, proceeded to taste test the drink at the table and stated nope it's not what you ordered I'll just give you water instead ????  can see why attitudes were where they are, though manger with Hugh holes in his ears he was so disconnected.   Food - normally good but today 1/23 around noon  It was pretty much a mess. What gives?"}
{"text":"Came here with some Yelpers after the Rock & Roll Wine event. I had been avoiding this place because of all the excitement surrounding this place. With that kind of noise, there is bound to be a line, and there was.   The atmosphere of this place is similar to that of Johnny Rockets or any other old fashion burger joint and malt shop.   The prices are cheap for a sit down restaurant. Most of the items were around 6 and they have specials for $3.99. My sister and I split the single steakburger with cheese and bacon. All the sandwiches and dogs come with a side of shoestring fries. Either orders stood out to be as magnificent as I have heard. In fact, what everyone said that night was more accurate. Maybe if I was drunk and needed a cheap burger I would appreciate it more. The toasted bun was more on the hard side. Saw that they pre-toast a pile to keep up with demand. The patties were thin and had little flavor. I also ordered a mint cookies 'n cream milkshake ($3.49). Besides the color, nothing else would hint at mint. It was a good green Oreo shake and not too sweet. Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it is not bad for a cheap bite while at the South Point."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's hard to find a good and simple meal in Las Vegas, but this place is good, simple and cheap!  We were fortunate to have beat the rush on a Saturday afternoon. They were able to seat 17 of us pretty quickly.   My sister and I decided to split the guacamole burger.  It comes with fries. You can upgrade the fries to seasoned fries for like 75 cents. I added a cup of chili to the meal and I thought it was pretty good. The burger was so good. I definitely would come back again to try to other burgers. All the burgers are super cheap. They also have a good selection of shakes but I didn't try them"}
{"text":"I now know why this place always has a long line out the door. The food is cheap, there really aren't any cheaper options inside the Southpoint unless your willing to get a cart hot dog. We heard the shakes are good, but skipped the sweets. The burgers are way over rated. The burgers are thin and dry on a toasted bun. Reminded me of burgers ( that I hated) that we used to get at a drive in restaurant in Pennsylvania when I was a little girl. The fries were crispy but bland, thankfully they provide fry seasoning at each table that redeemed them. The hostess and waiter were friendly enough but they mumbled and spoke quickly making it difficult to understand them most of the time. We finally got the hype of this place out of our systems. Happy we only spent about $15 on our 2 burger and fry orders. We may go back to try a shake, but nothing else."}
{"text":"I figured 4 years later, someone from corporate must have come in to straighten things out.    NOPE  It actually got worse.  I should have known when I got there at 8:30 and not a person on there.  I got my order in a sack, even though I was eating in.  No flavor.  Cook must have lost the famous seasoning salt shaker.  The bun was even greasey.  Ugh.    I tried, but they failed again.  I guess I'll have to travel out of state to get a real Steak and Shake experience."}
{"text":"Usually I have no problem with this place, but the service this time around was just bad. After she took our order and brought us drinks, we never heard from our server again...For the rest of the night. I thought she just forgot about us, but we made eye contact a couple times and still nothing. After 45 minutes, another server finally brought us our food. After that, we never heard from anyone again. I decided to serve myself and got a menu from the front, more ketchup from another table, and napkins from the bathroom. Now that's just sad.  The bottom of the buns were so soggy they nearly disintegrated when I picked them up. This is probably because they were sitting out for 45 minutes. Besides that, food was good."}
{"text":"Unkempt. Dirty tables.  Burgers good. It should be a clean place to eat.  Next time I'll choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype about this place is for.  The food was OK but odd.  The burger patties were almost cracker like in appearance and texture.  While the flavor was fine it left me a little hungry.  The service was relatively slow and the lights were way too bright.  Our party looked pretty rough after 4 days in Vegas and these lights made it even worse."}
{"text":"Looooove the bacon burger, fries and shakes. Being from the Midwest, I miss places like this!"}
{"text":"Worst service..... We waited in line to get seated for about 10 minutes. There were several empty tables that were not bussed. The hostess finally came and took our name and number of people in our party. We were told it would be a 20 min wait. If the staff moved a little faster we could have been seated promptly. We waited a few more minutes the empty tables still were not cleaned so we left."}
{"text":"Always have a great dinner when we stop in after work! Ask for Dani (amazing service!)"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular fast-food-plus eater. If I want fast food I go for that and if I want mid-range I go for that. Steak and Shake is neither, it's in the middle somewhere.   Essentially what we have here is expensive fast food. Sure, the quality is a touch higher than the Big Three fast fooderies but perhaps not sufficiently so to warrant the extra cost. Then again, to each his own tastes.   If you're after a cheap burger, this ain't it. If you're after fine dining, this ain't that either. If what you'd like is a variety of burger options in a reasonably decent setting this they do nicely.   The shakes are rather tasty and the burgers are indeed a cut above the norm. If you don't mind paying more for what you get and aren't expecting a five-star out of burger joint then you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came here cause i saw a picture of their shakes and wanted to try them & let me tell u their shakes are really really good! I ordered the double bacon cheese burger with the banana strawberry milkshake and it was just what I expected! & their prices are really cheap! Definitely one of my favorite burger places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The customer service was the worst I've ever experienced. The shift supervisor had the worst attitude and sarcastic tone. Ismael Torres should not be working here. After waiting for 30 mins I never got my food. Ismael comes over and starts joking and making light of the situation. Then he insults me. I have never been so offended. I logged a complaint with security and the Manager. I'm still waiting to see what happens. All I have to say is that if you come here steer clear of Ismael."}
{"text":"Cheap food, fast. Four meals (chicken fingers, 3-way chili, 2 hotdogs and 2 drinks) all for less than $20.  You know what you are getting here, it's always consistent.  I only rated four stars because the place could use a good cleaning. The server wiped crumbs from the table onto the booth seat and never bothered to wipe the seat"}
{"text":"Burger was excellent however I was looking forward to the seasoned fries and was disappointed by the dusting in my plate. Service was wonderful and our waitress went above and beyond to assist our table! Thank you, Sara!"}
{"text":"Most meals here were $4 or less.  I am not sure how any restaurant can make money, but it appears this place can do it.   The burgers were good, but the fries were pretty lame.  They were cold and wilty. The shakes were huge and good. The salads were somewhat bleh with a very modest amount of chicken when you order a salad with that protein.  I know, it's a burger joint, but I've been eating like a pig and needed ruffage. For the money, it's hard to beat.  Just stay with the staples of Steaks and Shakes."}
{"text":"One word about sums it up here folks: YUM!  My friend who loves S&S insisted we had to check it out as it's the only location anywhere near the west coast.  It is a large location inside SouthPointe Casino -- one of the first casinos that appear when you hit Vegas.  There was a line to get seated but it went quick and service was very fast also!   I loved the selection of burgers and have to agree with my friend that the food is delish. The shakes were also to die for here -- splurge and you won't regret it. They also have this fabulous seasoned salt for the fries that I liked so much I had to buy a bottle.   Another advantage -- it's really inexpensive!"}
{"text":"review on shakes only!  check this out at 1pm - half off on all shakes! the shakes are good too."}
{"text":"Fun inexpensive burger joint, with a good menu. Used to be my daughter's and my favorite burger place. Right up until they took out the kids menu! They are not kid friendly. We would have a bite then see a movie. Now it's 5 guys and see a movie at town square!"}
{"text":"I came here at around 9:00 with a group of 8. When we were taking our\"reservation\" and we said 8 she rolled her eyes and said 40 min. We wanted and finally we got seated in a small both that was made for 6 as we are not the skinnier of people we were very squished . We order and it took maybe 30 min to get it food. We ordered milkshakes and got them way after we finished our food. The food was really good. We went 2 days after and got the same lady and again with the eye rolling. She got the number of people in our group and then the lady behind us had the same number of people and got seated first so we asked why and she said they were here before shop we went to cafe Coronado cafe"}
{"text":"I like this place! Home made style burgers and the shakes are great!! My total check for a double, fries, and a shake was under 10 bucks!!! Nice spot"}
{"text":"I really miss the old Steak 'n Shake which used to be one of my favorites. It seems the quality of the food has gone down ever since they expanded the menu. The burgers used to have crispy edges and the buns were toasted. Now they have guacamole and put mayonnaise on their burgers when you ask for everything. The only thing that hasn't changed is the good old greasy chili mac."}
{"text":"I heard so many bad reviews about this place because they aren't like the Original diner but this location is AMAZING! Incredible staff that my nephew really adored (they even gave him a little build able car that he ended up breaking a few seconds later) the food was delicious. The manager on duty (Andrew) got our food out right away and the cashier Vivian  helped us order since we've never heard of Steak and Shake before but we definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping my son talked me into stopping at Stake and Shake for dinner.  (I'm not going to lie I was too tired to cook so I didn't resist)!  We ordered a couple of meals off the under $4 menu which has a nice variety of options. The fries were nice and hot and the burgers were juicy and tasty too!  We drove up to the drive-through window where we were greeted by Katlyn's beautiful smile and dynamic personality! We paid for food and two minutes later we were on our way.  If you live in an area with a steak and shake be sure to look out for the steak and shake coupons!  It's 3/19/18 and I'm updating my Steak and shake review because the last few times I've been here the food quality has dropped! The burgers that used to be tasty and juicy are now thin, dried out and lacking flavor! My burger and my some burger was smushed against the \"not so fresh bun\" and the fries were ice cold! The fish platter was the saddest thing I've seen in a while. The fish was cold, dried out and broken in the middle and the fries were old and cold! What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Best deal for a burger and shake. Friendly staff, nice hotel. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I used to work next to a Steak 'n Shake when I was in college (east of the Mississippi) so I ate there all the time and loved it.  I saw this Steak 'n Shake as I was going to the AMC Centerpoint and thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.  I got the double cheeseburger with fries combo which was only about $4...cheaper than it was several years ago.  That should have been a red flag that something was wrong.  I placed my order and got food within 3 minutes...way shorter than the wait used to be.  This indicates to me that they prepare everything in advance (fast food style) rather than the cook to order method of the place I used to frequent.  The quality of the food was not good.  It had hints of the old flavors I used to enjoy so much but it was nowhere near the same.  The flavors were all watered down...even the fries.  It was even further away from the original taste than when you buy frozen entrees at the grocery store from real restaurants.  It's almost like a former employee half-remembered the recipe and tried starting a Steak 'n Shake on his own.    If this was my first experience with Steak 'n Shake, I'd never eat at another one again.  Luckily for me, I've had many other experiences and know that this restaurant is the exception and not the rule.  Unfortunately I waited to look at Yelp reviews until after I ate there, but I see many of them have the same complaint as me.  I will say that the place was clean when I was there (unlike other reviews stated).  If you're looking to have a Steak 'n Shake burger, don't get it here...go further east."}
{"text":"I have only been to this location once and I don't know if they are having an off night, but we just waited 15 minutes in the drive-thru to order 2 milkshakes. It then took us over 10 more minutes to actually get our milkshakes. I'm not sure why service took this long, but if you're looking for fast food (or a quick milkshake) do yourself a favor and go across the street to Freddy's."}
{"text":"Website states \"open 6am - midnight\". I was there at 22.10 and it was already closed. Best thing about this place is the Applebee's within walking distance.  How hard can it be to keep a website up to date?"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite while my dad was in the ER up the road. The place is 80% empty and I waited 5 min to get seated. Another 5 min and the manager took my drink order. The server came by right after and took my order.     I see three servers but so far only one is working and the others seem to be wandering around. I see a couple waiting to be seated while the wanderer is watching from the drink station. AAAAAnd they just walked out.     The kitchen did good. My food was out 8min from when I placed my order ( yes I time the kitchen when I eat out). The burger was great and the fries hot.     This would be a great place if the employees were taught a little teamwo"}
{"text":"Are here last week. Had the fish sandwich and a chocolate shake. The sandwich was good and the shake was very thick. Food quality is ok. The burgers are much better."}
{"text":"Stopped here while my dad was at the hospital. Service was quick being later in the evening but food quality was just okay.  Probably do a better job during the day."}
{"text":"Yelpers on Talkback know that I've been waiting for this day.  A tear nearly rolled down my cheek upon the news several months ago when I discovered that Vegas was getting a Steak 'n Shake.  I had fond memories of the place when I first discovered in in Florida several years ago, and the burning jealousy that later formed once I moved from my home state of Texas only to find that, surprise!  They put one in right after I left.  I tell you, isn't that always the way?  Personal story aside, I waited and waited until lo, this day has come, and the Steak 'n Shake has landed in Vegas.  I went to the South Point Casino to get my \"Tron Legacy\" tickets when I saw the line.  It was well around the corner.  I just wanted food.  I didn't need to sit at the restaurant.  So I asked if I could do take out.  They promptly sent me to the front of the line as I wasn't needing to wait for a table.  The manager was there and he greeted me warmly.  I guess he knew in his heart of hearts that this was a special day for us all.  I ordered two of the double steak burgers and some \"Buffalo\" style sliders.  The prices were reasonable, all things considered, and the wait wasn't that long.  When I got my bag, the server girl was all friendly and smiles.  So away I spirited my treasures like how Rumplestiltskin covets....  Well, whatever it is that Rumplestiltskin covets, I was like that, but holding onto my prize even tighter.  As I was leaving, some woman pointed to my bag and said \"Look!  He has Steak 'n Shake!\"  This helped to further my feeling that I was the coolest kid in the casino.  Away I dashed home, eager to eat my steaky, shakey goodness, nibbling their fries all the way home.  I can be a \"fry snob\", but these are tasty.  Then came eating time.  It was like an angel descended from upon high and said onto me: \"You've been a reasonable sort of late.  Here's a hamburger for being so well behaved.  A hamburger... MADE OF STEAK.  Because you are awesome!!!\"  And so, I ate my angel laden steakburger, and was thusly full.  Is it truly that amazing?  Honestly, I'd give it a four star experience, but the service was so helpful and friendly, I'm giving this place a five star experience.  My enthusiasm for being there \"Day 1\", coupled with the wait made it a fun and tasty experience.  Tomorrow I go see \"Tron\".  I'm also going back to Steak 'n Shake before the movie starts.  Could the day get any better?"}
{"text":"Based on service only. Food and shakes are very good."}
{"text":"i honestly didnt know what the big deal about this place was & some of the reviews on here arent great but this place is awesome!! the shakes are amazing & the burgers are huge & delicious. get there early so you dont have to wait in that long line!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Coca Cola Freestyle was seriously empty of the regular flavors and the water was flat. The fries were not good...they almost make you feel sad in emotion. There's no need to order the prime steak burger over the original, both will be cooked dry and taste the same. I really want to see the positive in this place... I just can't. It is clean, there's a positive.."}
{"text":"1st off I hate STEAK N SHAKE but I was going to see a late premier of Age of Adaline and I just moved to this part of the city.. Originally lived by Red Rock Casino but I wanted a younger more hip area so South Pointe is my most local casino... I have never been inside the casino before!   I almost CRAPPED MY PANTS when I seen a Steak and Shake since I thought we only had them back home ... OHIO!!!   I had s Frisco... Ate 1/2 got sick not sure if it was stress of the 1lb of butter and the cold shoe string fries!  Im a server so I'm not saying the servers name...she was sweet but I sat 7 mins before greeted so the moment I was greeted I said my drink and food order .... A good runner brought it out...I asked for a little extra sauce for my fries ...another server brought that out ...ok now that's good team work... But then the server came back to ask if everything is ok but when she's standing behind me. I just had five spinal fusion operations and seriously had to get up and turn around to see if she was for real talking to me.... Either way I'll never go back cause I don't eat fast food and I ONLY ate it to remind me of home... But those seniors love it ...and honestly those shakes are on point!!!  But why em at chain food in this city of choices of places to dine....."}
{"text":"Good food for the money but the last time I visited I found a hair in my burger. I pulled it out and told my wife that the hair is short and curly. She looked into the kitchen and none of the cooks had curly hair! I thought it looked like a pubic hair. I complained to the manager and all she did was remove the burger from the bill. I gelt the whole meal should have been free.   *side note: Yelp, you should have a negative star icon for places that don't warrant one star rating like Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. This is a franchise Steak 'n Shake. It does not have a full menu. It does not have the Steak 'n Shake chilli mac that has been a staple for Steak 'n Shake since the very beginning of the chain. It's akin to a McDonald's franchise NOT having the Big Mac on the menu. Sorry but I have eaten at Steak n Shake all over the Midwest.  This store is nothing like what you would find at a normal Steak 'n Shake restaurant. Major failure."}
{"text":"Hey, not sure about all the other reviews, but we got here after 10pm after the crappy traffic over at downtown Pitts crossing the bridge which took over 80 mins. Anyway, ya decent burger, comp to a Habit and similar to INO. Decent shakes with many flavors. Decent service for a 10 o'clock dine in.  We see that S 'n S are making there way to LA, we'll see if they can compete? We were here a month ago."}
{"text":"2 words: WISCONSIN BUTTERY. I freaking love this place. The burgers are cheap and amazing. The shakes are awesome too. I normally get cookie dough, they have both kids size and regular. I always get a kids size shake because the regular size is huge. Everytime I come in, I never even look at the menu. The buttery is by far, hands down, the best burger ever. It's buttery! How can you go wrong with that?!?!"}
{"text":"I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow..."}
{"text":"We like that this restaurant is located inside the South Point casino. It's a great place for a quick bite to eat since the casino doesn't have a food court. There are many restaurants but no fast food place that serves burgers.  I got the western BBQ burger which was very plain. I think they forgot the BBQ part. It had chopped onions and small pieces of onion rings in it.  It tasted fine considering it was only $5.75 for the burger and fries. Btw, I love their shoestring fries!   Our server was Jason who was very nice and attentive! We were seated right away and didn't have to wait long for Jason to come over and take our order so that was a plus!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice.  Nowhere near as good as the Steak and Shakes I have dined in in Florida.  Just as slow though!  Burger and bun seemed burnt both times.  Second time burger was cold and like it had been sitting around (even though they were extremely busy, so how could it have sat around?)  And my shake was melted.  Disappointed.  Would not drive all the way to Robinson ever again to dine here.  Next time Burgatory!"}
{"text":"Customer service is poor at drive thru. I was just there 2mins ago first time and ordered the bacon lovers thinking it comes with fries and a drink but the guy who took my order didn't say or offer me anything else after placing my order. Get to the window and ask if it comes with a drink and they were oh no not the one you ordered but I can give you water, like what the heck offer me a soda or something. My last time going there.   I work in customer service and the way you treat your customers is what will keep your business going."}
{"text":"Ok so first they messed up my hotdogs I wanted only cheese and when I told them they messed them up they made me new ones but and this is where it gets gross the guy blew in the bag to open it up so me seeing this I said I wanted to talk to Manger and she did nothing what a place nasty"}
{"text":"So I ordered my drinks at 11:00PM. It's 11:19 now and I still haven't got my drinks. I can understand if it's busy, but it's not. I can also understand if I ordered a shake, but I didn't. I ordered water. Really?  Who knows how long it'll take to make my chicken sandwhich. Unless their chicken sandwhich blows me away, i'm not coming back. Go to the one on Neil ST instead."}
{"text":"What a horrible place.  Went through the drive thru, and the girl taking my order told me to go ahead with my order, then immediately cut me off after I started ordering.  I restarted my order and she stopped me two more times, and was clearly carrying on and laughing.  After I placed my order for three meals and paid, I was asked to pull forward.  I waited 10 minutes for my order to be brought out, while two cars behind me received their orders and drove away.  When it finally came out, my wife's Frisco Melt looked like it wasn't even grilled.  Will never go here again, there are too many other choices for fast food in Macedonia Commons."}
{"text":"I came to this location a couple of times during their opening and it's fine for a quick meal. It's consistent with other locations in Columbus I've been to in prices and quality of food.   Burgers have the thinnest meat ever but not bad tasting. In fact, the thinness adds to the crispiness but it's not much value. Fries are tiny and skinny and small portioned. The vegetable slices are skimpy. I always add their pepper sauce and inevitably eat one of those peppers as that's the most flavorful thing. Prices are similar to 5 Guys but there are plenty of coupons you can use from the paper. The shakes are great and get no complaints from me. I always end up sharing b/c I can't down that sugary monster by myself.   I've never had an issue with service. I like the sit-down format of a '50s diner. This location is convenient, there's ample parking and Target, Walmart, etc. are nearby."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the food is not consistent.  You will be on line outside for a good while.   They are inpatient if you don't know what you want, but they will customize as much as possible to please their customer.    Their shakes are often very watery and poorly made.  They put so little whipped cream on it, its like they almost would rather not.  They get the orders wrong 40% of the time, but due to their location...  I keep finding myself there."}
{"text":"This place has the slowest service ever! Food is ok if you don't mind waiting forever for it to come."}
{"text":"Food is good if/when you get it. Last few times I've been here with friends they were slightly busy and it's been pretty bad. Waiting 10-15 minutes after being seated to get a waitress, no knives, having to flag down ANOTHER waitress just to get refills are just a few examples of the bad experiences I've had. And it can't just be me as I've seen multiple people walk out. I was thinking of giving this 3 stars because the burgers & shakes ARE good! But because it's been more than once, I had to knock them a star. If you have the patience of a saint, enjoy. Otherwise, I might not recommend it if they're even the slightest bit busy."}
{"text":"Awesome good burger. If you are looking fo a quick yet excellent burger then don't go further. I don't eat a lot of meat now like many getting little older people out there, but when I do, I usually have few bites and I'm done. I am a hybrid eater. Mostly pure plant food and the rest is just a bite or two of animal protein. But Steak 'n Shake inside SouthPoint is close to amazing for me. Quick and just 23 bucks for three people with no drinks is absolutely something you won't mind right.? The tiny little cut fries is also so good. The ranch dressing is excellent. I know when it taste good, it's bad for you. But today? Forget that. Time to enjoy what is in front of you. I see other people around us slurping tall  shakes ... that must be really good but Im so full. I have no room for a milk shake. For sure I will be back again next time thirsty and hungry..   Tomorrow back to green plant food again until next trip."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, very attentive! Food was served within 10-15 minutes and the prime burger is excellent. Try it with the cherry limeade."}
{"text":"So we've been wanting to try this place for a little while, and we happened to be on Mill Ave and in front of it so why not? I wasn't too hungry, so the man got a bacon bbq burger and we shared a shake. Total of about $8-$9. The burger was good.... I tried a bite and I definitely think it was worth the $5 we paid... plus it came with fries. The shake was pretty good...nothing too special but was a lot larger than we were expecting. The only downside to the meal is the fries. They were way overly salted. But they did let me try with the Parmesan seasoning and they did a bit better and will probably try them next time."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for one reason: Elijah. Not even sure if that's how you spell his name, but I came here for an early dinner with my wife and child, and he had a huge smile on his face when we walked in. We told him it was our first time and he walked us through the menu and made recommendations. After ringing us up, he personally went back, fired up the grill (we were the only customers at the time), and made our burgers. I got the royale and my wife got the portobello.  Order came our quick. Patties were cooked perfectly. Burgers were great, but he forgot the egg on mine, which I noticed after the first bite. I left him know and he genuinely apologized. I could tell he felt terrible. He told me to enjoy my burger as is and he'd make me a totally new one. I did just that. Both burgers were phenomenal and so were the shakes. We were also surprised that the burgers came with fried given the cost.  I guess these days I don't expect customer service at \"fast food\" restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised. I had to write this because people like Elijah deserve some recognition."}
{"text":"This location always has a ridiculously long line out the door.  You'd think they were going into a niteclub.  We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.    SOOOOOOO..welcome to \"plan E\".    We opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  \"Save it for the burger\" I told myself.   Finally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.      What the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Overall the new location is nive and spacious.  I really like the way the inside looks.  Food was what you would expect from Steak'n Shake.  It was obvious it was opening night and the staff is working things out.  However, they were all very friendly.  I like this location better than the South Point.  Only downside as a local is that it's down on the strip.  I guess that's a plus for tourists wanting a decently priced burger."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. Something to satisfy everyone.  The burgers have plenty of toppings. The chicken has just enough crisp on outside and tender inside. The atmosphere is casual and fun. 50's music."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Steak 'n Shake.  It's the one by which I measure all of the others.    The food is fast, fresh and delicious.  And the shakes are amazing.  If there's room for improvement here, it would be getting the shakes to the table a bit faster.  Sometimes they don't show up until after the food has arrived, and this seems to be a problem at all Steak 'n Shakes.  But again, this location seems to do it better than the others.  I often find myself standing in line to eat here, but the line usually moves fairly quickly.  And let's be honest, there's a reason why people are willing to stand in line to eat here.  It's really good.  And fantastic value for quality and quantity of food provided.  And the service is always excellent here as well.  In fact, it's some of the best service that I've received anywhere - and I don't just mean Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"Run run run fast as you can. Place is filthy dirty I don't know how they pass health inspection. What a dump.no staff but still can't get pass the filthiest place I been to smells like crap in there to. Trust me I love steak m shake but don't go to this one!!!"}
{"text":"It's just not the same as back east. Came here and the place is filthy, tables dirty, floor dirty, trash needing to be emptied. The fries were a bit burnt. I ordered a shake but they were out of two of the toppings I wanted. Parking is tricky because of mill Ave, we had to pay to park for $2/hr."}
{"text":"So I can't really give this a full 5 star review because well, they just opened and the service while prompt is chock full of flaws.  And, the wait for seating is out of control.  My advice is, go in the take out line and go sit down in the sports book area and the Del mar deli / bar area, where they have tons of spacious booths.  If you're a filthy smoker, you can even smoke and eat your burger at the same time!  I tried a double cheddar burger and found the portion size right, for a fast food restaurant, where everything is somewhat small.  I was fully satisfied with just two patties and found them way more flavorful than I imagined, and blows away pretty much every other fast food burger in town.  With three patties you're most likely going to have a coronary.  My main reason for loving these burgers though, is that they use real cheddar cheese, not that imitation gunk cheese that is normally used.  It really put this over the top, and with the combination of meat and real cheddar made me wish I had another burger on the drive home.  I'm really happy that this is in a casino and not a normal drive through fast food local restaurant, or I would eat here often.  And gain all the weight I lost in 2010."}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD. 45 minutes for the thinnest burger I have ever seen. Always under staffed and then the staff is stressed beyond what anyone should be at work therefore not giving their best service. I don't know in what world you have only 5 workers when it's a well known fact the night will be busy. Messed up my order, and the bun was hard. Also the place was completely filthy with soda spilled on the floor where customers needed to walk."}
{"text":"So I'm not a major goodie but this place sucks.  Not worth the line at all!   The \"steak burgers\" are as if ground beef and skirt steak had a baby then it was pan fried just a little too long and topped with different things then stuffed between some buns. It's so thin that it HAS to come double stacked or else there's like no meat.  This is a knock off version of Johnny Rockets if you've ever been there."}
{"text":"What's the hype???  The burgers are all right fries are okay but what gave this place my third star is that the mint shake is probably the best shake I ever had. NUff said"}
{"text":"What the HECK SnS??? You totally let me down today! Being the \"Yelper\" amongst my friends I convinced a group to wait in line for an hour to be one of the first to try this hot new place....and you made me look so bad.  Downers:  1) They forgot our shakes and brought them after our meal was served and almost finished 2) They forgot our order and we had to hunt someone down to get it put in. 3) Everything was wrong on everyones order except one burger. YIKES! No cheese, no bacon, forgot to take the onions off... disaster! When we asked for the cheese the waitress put a cold slice of cheese on the burger and brought it back. WTHeck. 4) When the manager came to the table he was not at all concerned about all that went wrong with our experience and did not want to take care of us at all. Finally he suggested giving us our shakes for free (the ones they forgot to order and brought after our meal) Really???  5) The meat in the burgers were really small, nothing at all like the photos. It similar to the size of the kids meal McDonalds burger. Disappointed for sure! 6) There is no bathroom in the restaurant and you have to go out to the casino to go..if you have too go :)  Some Pluses:  1) The shakes were awesome - once we got them :) 2) The taste of the meat in the burger was really good....just really small.... 3) The hostess at the front had the best guest service. She was the one who noticed that no one had brought our food or shakes out and rushed around to make it right. She was awesome and should be manager! 4) Price - the price was decent. They even had $4 menu that gave you a burger and fries for $3.99. Thats a pretty great deal! 5) I love the South Pointe and think it is a great idea to have it inside the hotel.  Overall - this place has nothing on In-n-Out. Not worth a hour in line wait at all. I might give this place a second go in a month or so and see if anything has changed. I totally understand that bumps have to be worked out in the beginning but as of now......not impressed.   Steak - n - Shake.....I'm still not over what you did to my good name today...not yet anyways."}
{"text":"I have had some really poor experiences at this location. But as we tend to write only about the bad. Today Jordan whom I think is manager, changed my view and has made me hopeful about this place. My food was timely, good and did not have old grill stuff in it. Jim who took care of me was also very kind!!! Way to go management!!!"}
{"text":"Tried steak n shake for the first time in Orlando. Was super good just because it was a late night snack. And heard that it opened up in Vegas at southpoint casino. Haaaaaad to go when I went to Vegas of course!  First time hitting up southpoint. They really do have the worlds greatest slots! Haha. Played while waiting in line. Makes the line move faster!   My bf and I were here during happy hour. He ordered the BBQ bacon burger. He's a Carls jr. western bacon cheeseburger lover and felt guilty for betraying his loyalty. But I convinced him to try it. He hasn't had Carls jr. since!   I ordered the guacamole burger. I love guacamole! Oh so yummy!! And their shake was perfectly made! So good!   Even better that southpoint slots paid for our meal! :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on the franchise concept of Steak 'n Shake. The negative reviews comparing it to a full version of Steak 'n Shake do not do it justice because it can not compare, different concept, limited menu, different service. At first, I was a little disappointed but when I asked the employee she explained the differences between the Signature and full version.   The burger was tasty, which is a lot coming from me because I am not a big burger person. I was slightly disappointed because the burger I ordered was supposed to come with crispy onion strings and I didn't realize they were missing until I was reheating my leftovers.  The fries are delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crispiness.  The shake was ok. Can't go wrong with a ice cream shake. But just average...probably not worth the price.  The food is very affordable but the shakes are a bit spendy, in my opinion.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unlike most Steak 'n Shakes, there's no table service at this location. The menu is an abridged version of the standard one. All of that would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that they messed up 2 of the 3 orders during a non-peak time of service. Plus, an employee appeared to be sleeping at one of the larger tables."}
{"text":"I'm always here because I have no job because I'm lame. Just kidding I do have a job so I spend my whole paycheck here. My girlfriend doesn't have a job either and is always here. We basically have no life but who cares right? This is almost like an episode of shameless cause we try to cheat the system. My favorite character on that show has to be lip cause he is so smart. By the way get the frisco melt"}
{"text":"Am try to find a really good burger, this isn't it! My first and last visit. Terrible service. The food was COLD maybe because we had to wait 3 - 4 minutes after it finally came to get silverware and a napkin. The waiter was rude and could care less about being there. Maybe Mr Gaughn should rethink the Service Award that is displayed there. The product is inferior, steak burger (?). A $4.75 milk shake that had chunks of ice in it! All in all a really bad experience, but as I said I will not go back!"}
{"text":"Milkshakes are delicious!  Food is good, but I'm not a fan of the fries.  Service is typically subpar.  Food takes a long time to be served.  And very rarely does the milkshake get delivered at the same time as the meal."}
{"text":"Long waits. Ridiculously rude staff. Was overcharged and when I asked for a manager after being told that I wasn't  I was given a regular employee. Who then brought me a manager who was finally able to correct their mistake. After I was given my refund I heard the first employee ask why he gave me my money back. I have never had a good experience here and this will be my final attempt."}
{"text":"I've hear this place is like the In-n-Out of the Midwest/East.  So since we had to make a stop at Southpoint, decided to eat here.  it's a simple place and a simple burger.  The price was great!  $8 for a double cheeseburger, fries and shake.  however, the burger was small and not great.  the fries are the shoestring type and I like the thinker type of fry and the milkshake was not that great.  Service was fine and I liked the 50s décor.  Food wise, did not do it for me."}
{"text":"Kid's eat free on weekends.  We love that.  Our food has always been cooked to order and comes out fast.  The service so far, has always been friendly and decent.  It's way better than McDonalds and comparable in cost.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Anthony is the goat. It looked like he was the only person serving everyone else and his customer service is great. Food's lit too. Get some cajun fries with that burger."}
{"text":"This place holds a special memory for some of us who grew up eating the best thin steak burgers, and delish malt/milk shakes  and those ity bitty fries covered in cheese!  This was second visit since this location opened and today was almost as busy as the opening day!  Met up with another Steal 'n Shake lover who has missed the familiarity for the past few years, and we were not disappointed. She had the avocado burger and a huge 'side' salad, I had the double bacon steak burger and fries and it takes just like it always did growing up.  Line when we arrived and still a line when we were leaving.  Waitress seemed a bit dingy didn't get obvious humor, and had NO CLUE what a taka-hom-a-sak was I would figure that would be part of their training :) A side from our drinks not being refilled consistently or with out us flagging her down our meal was great and exactly what we hoped for.  Got a chili to go (that's when I made the taka-hom-a-sak comment to her) and it ended up exploding before I got it home to the hubby :( Ah well it's the thought that counts right?"}
{"text":"Great place for burgers.. Due to the location, lines can be really lengthy. You need to have patience."}
{"text":"It's cheap. It's good. What more can I elaborate on?   They had a 2 for $3 deal where you could get a burger and fries for $3, if that's your choosing and along with a milkshake--that I got customized-- my total ended up being around $7. Which is very good for a meal, at least I think so.   I ate in with my friend and the service was also phenomenal. However, regarding cleanliness, it was kind of questionable.   I understand that you can only expect so much for a fast food joint, but it just looked dirty on the inside and wasn't very ideal to sit in. And the wait time was okay and not horrible. We ended up waiting around 10-15 mins to be seated for just two."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since I was a kid.  It's always been clean and the food is cheap and delicious.  Also, the milkshakes are amazing!  This place is good if you want to keep it casual and have a quick sit-down dinner!"}
{"text":"I met my family here for lunch one day and I have to say I am disappointed. The meal itself was great and the service was fantastic, until 2 pm, which is when the beverages (including milkshakes) are half off.   We ordered our milkshakes at about 2:05 and didn't get them until almost 2:40 and when they arrived at our table, they were all melted. Mine literally looked like chocolate milk (I added some pictures, mine are the two of a chocolate milkshake that looks like just chocolate milk). I skipped out on the the whipped cream and my cherry sunk to the bottom, however, I am grateful mine was made right. Two out of four were not made like we asked. My dad sent his soupy mess back and got a decent milkshake.  I understand they were probably busy because 2 pm is when the special starts, but you would think they would have several people working when the drinks go on sale to make sure everyone had a decent milkshake. I mean, their name is 'Steak'n'Shake.' They specialize in milkshakes. We didn't even get the 'shake.' We basically just got the 'milk.'"}
{"text":"After finally winning during a bingo session upstairs at the bingo hall one recent Saturday night, I checked off another bookmark by spending some of our earnings here afterwards.  It was around 8:45pm and there was a line, which I hear is the norm.  We waited about 25 minutes before four seats at the counter were offered and we took them.  I really only wanted to have a shake since we had a big dinner earlier, but I was also curious about how their steakburgers tasted since friends have been comparing this place to that new burger and shake joint on the Strip (which I was not that impressed with).    We placed our orders quickly, but for some reason the burgers came out before the shakes did. The boyfriend had one of the steakburgers with cheese that I got to try and I found it to be very greasy so I'm glad I didn't get my own.  Our waiter kept saying the shakes were on their way, but it took a long time.  Mel was almost done with his food by the time the shakes finally arrived. However, I really enjoyed the strawberry banana shake ($4.95) I had with actual fresh fruit in it and the prices aren't bad for the size of the shake. There is quite a vast selection of shakes to choose from here, so I'd definitely come back for another one (perhaps the Red Velvet or Salted Caramel), just not the steak."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place and it was delicious.  I ordered the guacamole steak burger and added jalapeños and French fried onions. It was very good. The French fries were good as well.  Went back the next day and ordered the Royale and parmesan herb fries(my friend had it the night before and I enjoyed it). It wasn't as good as the night before. Everything seemed to be dry. I actually ended up getting the bubble guts shortly thereafter."}
{"text":"This place is very OK.  The price is good, but the burgers are small and the fries are nothing special.  The milkshakes seem to be made with artificial icecream. Not tasty!  I would go back if i wanted a burger and i was in the area, but i wouldn't go out of my way and definitely wouldn't get a shake again."}
{"text":"Good greasy burgers, nice thick shakes, salty fries... what more could you want?  I had the Wisconsin cheese burger.  Cheese was falling all over the burger.  Awesome. There is a line, and a wait.  But if you order in the to go line it's faster.  Then you can go eat in the casino."}
{"text":"Seated in a timely manner, food was good, but slow to come out. Shakes are lacking, ordered Oreo shake, took forever, basically vanilla ice cream with some Oreos on top. Birthday Cake shake, vanilla ice cream with sprinkles, peanut butter cup shake vanilla ice cream with pieces of pb cups. Not worth the money and flavor wasn't there. Banana shake at least had banana flavoring in it and had banana taste."}
{"text":".., another addition to our South Point shenannigans, this Indiana classic has a new found home in Vegas!  My gf Diane would always rave about their 24hr. location when she had gone to school out at the University of Purdue. From my take, Steak n' Shake has a cult following similar to how our local Californian's dig our beloved In N' Out burger.  We had attempted to eat here once before during a previous stay, but the line was \"super\" long, & we were \"super\" drunk. Feeling a bit too \"super\", we continued our blackjack binge before getting something to eat out on the strip, I think?  Then during our last visit, we finally made it our goal to eat here despite the hr. long wait. We lost track of time, given we were in Vegas,but I believe it was late afternoon.   The decor has a rockin' 50's theme w/ checkered tiling, pictures of curly haired Peggy Sue's drinking shakes, & tunes from Fats Domino, Elvis, etc. Once we were seated, we were taken care of immedietely.   I ordered the original cheesy cheddar steak burger along w/ shoestring fries, & a bowl of chili while Diane had their chili spaghetti. The burger itself was delicious. It didn't wow me the way I expected, but it has quality ingredients, fresh produce, & felt like it was made with love. Fries were salty & tasty, but my favorite part of my meal was their chili. That really hit the spot. Diane's chili spaghettie was delicious as well, had a good portion to it & the noodles were on point.   The prices here are pretty cheap for what you'd expect. We paid around $17.50ish for our meal I believe which is not bad at all. My only dissapointment about this location is that it isn't 24 hrs. like the original in Indiana. You would think because it's Vegas & they would make a killing doing so, but it is what it is. Come check em' out!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and the food was fresh and hot. Definitely one of the best steak and shakes that I've been to. The waiters provide excellent service"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I got the western burger..coudnt finish it all.  Hubby got the all amerivan melt.  Yummy....under 29 bucks for the both of us."}
{"text":"This place sucked.   The waiter was rude and the food took forever to come out.  We were there right when they opened too. The waiter screwed up the orders too."}
{"text":"Steak n Shake comprises one of the 4 pillars of legendary burger chains.  The other 3 being In n Out, Five Guys, and White Castle.  Sometimes the hype surrounding them creates stratospheric expectations, but let's face the reality - they are all chains, and although you may not get the best burger you have had in your life, it is the best burger you can get at such an affordable price.  So Steak and Shake was high on my list of places to try since it is a bit of an oddity in the burger world. The CEO Sardar Biglari seems to strike many people as being a Warren Buffet wannabe (a compliment).  He has taken the Steak n Shake franchise and built it into a cash cow that allows him to buy stakes in other companies (pretty punny).  He has gone shopping for insurance companies in the past.  That's right, get your burger and your insurance policy all in one place.  In addition, he has renamed the company Biglari Holdings as well has issued a 20:1 stock reversal.  When was the last time you saw a stock for a burger joint at $400 a share?!?!?  This smacks of Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway strategy of creating a bajillion dollar company, but with much tastier offerings.  Have you ever purchased any handkerchiefs with Berkshire Hathaway logo on it? Eventually, that business was phased out.  So, off I went to Steak n Shake to see how Biglari's plan is coming along.  Then I saw the ridiculous lines and wait times.  I am pretty certain that this will probably continue to be a good cash generating business.  Once the hype dies down, the wait will be much less, but definitely a far better run business than Krispy Kreme.  Remember the lines there? Nowadays, it's Krispy what?    But let's get to the burgers.  I give a ton of props to the photographer for the menu as he/she has done wonders in making the burger look fantastically big.  When it arrives you will most likely be dumbfounded and think that they brought the wrong one.  I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery which is a double and I seriously doubt that it had more meat than a Big Mac.  But it was pretty decent.  It's hard to go wrong when you slap butter on something.  The quality of the meat was pretty good, although a bit miniscule.  It reminded me of jumping into a cold pool - major shrinkage.  Milkshakes are wonderfully rich and creamy, that it should be spoon eaten rather than using a straw unless you have the suction powers of a porn star.  And the cloth napkins were nice, but definitely a bit out of place.  Fries are super skinny and crisp, but nothing fantastic.  Their chili reminds me of a can of Hormel with beans.  The best way to enjoy your burger here is to drop your expectations - plain and simple.  Just remember to add 1 patty to what you would normally eat."}
{"text":"Today's lunch is really tasty! I'm enjoying a Portobello & Swiss along with a Diet Coke and regular french fries. Some visits are not as good as others, but for Steak n Shake, I have to give 5 stars when 5 stars are due!"}
{"text":"Just plain bad service. Food and drinks don't matter if you have to hunt for servers when they hide behind their station yapping about absolutely nothing. When I finally hunted down a server, food and drinks were tossed at us and never hear from server again. I guess SNS now pays regular hourly rate, because this deserves a 2 cent tip. 2 cents on the table eliminates the benefit of doubt that maybe I forgot to tip. The food was as expected for this medium-caliber restaurant. Biggest issue is that servers just don't care."}
{"text":"Apparently, this 24/7 Steak N' Shake doesn't answer the drive thru or the phone at night."}
{"text":"My first experience at Steak and Shake was in Daytona, FL. I had never tasted a milk shake like this in my life! I was over the moon in love! Needless to say I was pure excited when I found out that a Steak and Shake was coming to Las Vegas!  I have been a couple of times since the opening but have not had a chance to review yet.  My friend and I stopped in for lunch while out and about yesterday. We both ordered the Frisco Burger with fries and of course milk shakes! I had the Banana/Chocolate shake and my friend ordered the Caramel Turtle shake. Their shakes are what make this place great. The ice cream always tastes fresh. No lumps or ice. Our burgers were adequate but I would have preferred pickle on my burger as pickles go well with thousand island dressing.  The decor of this place looks like a throwback to the 50's with a malt shop feeling using red, black and white as primary colors. The company originates out of the state of Indiana. I enjoy having a Steak and Shake nearby but will always prefer the Florida location. I guess there is something about being under that warm Florida sun with a cool, tasty shake in your hand!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience here last night. I stopped by after class for a burger fries and shake and they did not disappoint. Food came out quick and hot and the shake was the best I've had in Arizona! The staff was so friendly and helpful and the restrooms were really clean. Definitely looking forward to coming back throughout the rest of the year."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype!  Mediocre. Chicken sandwich was soggy and sour. Bacon burger was tiny and bland. Not to mention the fries were dry and plain. Can't believe we waited in line SO LONG for such a huge let down.  Cake batter shake was bomb! Buuut nothing I'd go out of my way for. The red velvet shake tasted like chemicals..with the strangest after taste..??   Did I just mistakenly order allllll the wrong items?? Not impressed."}
{"text":"First time coming and many more. Octavio is the best waiter I've had in a long time. He was so nice and patient with me while I asked so many questions about the menu, and then he ended up recommending the best burger and one of the best shakes I've ever had. Totally went out of his way for us too. I wish I could've given a bigger tip, but I hope this shout out will do. Thanks again! :)"}
{"text":"I was shocked at the low sticker price at their burgers. Their triple burger is like $4.99, but was it good? You can make an arguement that in-n-out is better, so I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap burgers, cheap taste. Not worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service waited 15 minutes to be seated and at least 30 to even get a drink!!!! And I might mention that it's not even a busy night...... if was this franchise owner I would be furious and fire everyone in the restaurant. Even overheard a waitress yell out that she needed a cigarette...... I waited longer to eat here than I did waiting in line at Disney World."}
{"text":"We have only been to this location a couple of times since it is really not in the most convenient location (inside the Soutthpoint Casino), although we are huge fans of the Stake n Shakes in the Midwest! The food is consistently good and more so the milkshakes! This time we tried the orange freeze, Birthday cake, chocolate covered strawberry and the ultimate banana. Of the 4, birthday cake took the cake! Almost stole it from my 5 year old. The ultimate banana was disappointing and couldn't really taste the banana as well as the chocolate strawberry which still had frozen strawberries which threw off the flavor. This is a smaller location so wait times may vary for the wait on seating. They do offer a separate to go line if chose not to dine in."}
{"text":"Same ol Steak N Shake, burger was goo and shke was good. Nothing to blow my hair back. Oh, Wait! My sister ordered a Garlic Cheeseburger, that is something I would get if I have a chance to go back to Steak N Shake. Typical irritated waitstaff, typical sticky floors, typical dirty bathrooms."}
{"text":"Yelp challenge 2016: 017/365  This is a converted johnny rockets.  Service was decent most of the time. Food was kinda whack.   Brother likes the burger here.   The fries were pretty good. I had some chili cheese fries and it remimded me of elementary school chili. Then i saw 41% sodium and i almost had anither myocardial infarction.... ***gaaasp***  I got grilled chicken but the damn thing was waaaaay to salty so i just ate the bread and some veggies.   Place is type of places i wont be returning to due to health only."}

{"text":"Dear Steak 'n Shake,  It has been a fun run in Vegas since you started. I used to plan my cross country road trip routes based on when I could first make it to a Steak 'n Shake - so, when you opened up in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! Three visits on opening day ecstatic.  I have always joked that horrible service is part of the charm of SnS, my last two visits, you have taken this hallmark trait and ran with it. The end of May, my wife and I tried to get some food at SnS before I left for a trip back East. We were seated quickly enough that we were confident we could make it to a movie after dinner, if we so chose to do so. That is where the service stopped. Literally. It took 5 minutes (I keep a stopwatch going when I visit to see how bad your service is) for someone to acknowledge we were seated in their section, a server said hello and she would be right back to take our drink order. 6, yes S-I-X minutes later, we had not been acknowledged again. We walked out, not before we left a note on the table letting whoever saw it (probably a busser that ignored it) that making customers in a non-busy restaurant wait for 11+ minutes for no drink or food order is unacceptable.  Now we come to our visit yesterday for lunch. There was a bit of a line to be seated, was not that bad though. It only took 10-15 minutes to go through the corral and be seated. As you may infer, we know what we want to order when we get to SnS, this was again the case yesterday.   Within 3 minutes (Woohoo) our server took our drink and food orders. He informed us that SnS is now charging for sides of ranch and Frisco Sauce (are you kidding me?!) Whatever, I need the sauce to dip my Frisco Melt in, so I ordered it anyway. After a few hiccups trying to get our order taken properly, he re-read it back to us correct.  Our drinks came out and he forgot my wife's water (we both order water and something with flavor). Good thing, too, as that was the last we saw of our server. A food runner brought out our food and disappeared with quickness.  My wife opened up her burger after taking a bite and saw they put the salsa on it she specifically asked be left off (that our server confirmed would be left off) - he did not key it into the computer though.  We waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I finished my food.  And we waited some more.  Our drinks were now all completely empty. We were wishing the A/C was on a little warmer, so the ice would melt, giving us something else to drink.   As soon as our drinks were delivered, we did not see our server again. Not only did he avoid our table the rest of our visit but we did not see him in the dining room again until we were at the register.  My wife was fuming, as extremely hungry people tend to get, when food is before them that is not as ordered and NOBODY CHECKS ON YOU. This is the final straw and we will not be back.  On speaking with the cashier, she had to go in back to get authorization to remove the improperly prepared burger from the tab. We had other concerns and were not given a chance to speak with a manager. So, here it is for everybody to read and see how you treat your (formerly) loyal customers."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered take out from Steak 'n Shake.  There is always a line for a table, and I am usually in a hurry or don't have the patience to wait.  I like the concept of SnS.  It's fast food, but there are servers inside the restaurant.  It's also not only burgers.  They have chili as one of their menu specialties - and it's served Cinncinatti style, over spaghetti.  I need to go back and try this.  During my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken melt.  It was a breaded chicken filet topped with cheese, bacon and tomato and the frisco sauce.  This sandwich was only OK - the bread was super buttery (which equals greasy) and the chicken patty wasn't big enough for the bread slices. It came with a side of french fries.  Sadly, these were some of the worst fries I've ever had.  It was just their standard skinny fries, but they didn't seem fresh and they didn't really have any flavor.  The last time I was there, I ordered the frisco melt.  It was pretty good, but also very greasy.  I also ordered a shake - which seemed overpriced at $4 for a small.  And the shake are WAY too thick.  It's impossible to drink and is more of a dessert.  Otherwise, the burgers are reasonably priced.  The take out window is great.  There are plenty of menus available so you can decide what you want before getting to the front.  The service is always fast and friendly, and sometimes they have buzzers to let you know when your order is ready.   Overall a nice place with fast, friendly service.  It's something different than the typical fast food.  I hope that sometime they open another location locally not in a casino!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, but also not totally disappointed.  The bad:  The drive thru is a really bad set up. It's hard to access and is adjacent to the very busy St. Rose Pkwy, so when you are trying to order you cannot hear the person through the microphone box thingy. Also, this is a dumbed down menu and not what you're used to seeing at Steak n Shake. No chili or anything like that. So if you are looking for that, go to the location at South Point.  The good:  The food we had was tasty and fresh. Can't complain there. The service was friendly.  I doubt we'll be back - there was just nothing special about it and I'd rather go to the South Point for the full service experience. I honestly can't imagine this location surviving too long, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers!!! Service is always, always great even during rush hours!! Price is very affordable. Have tried almost all the burgers- it's four of us so we share :) Shakes are really good too!"}
{"text":"It's simple. Cook the frozen burger patty. Why does it take so long. Dumb. I'm sitting in the booth writing this review. The cook was to worried about the drive through then the customers in the waiting room. I've been here for an hour. Still no food. Dumb. Hungry."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, however they kind of tell you when they seat you that it will be several minutes before anyone will come to the table.  Than once they start taking your order they argue and don't listen to you.  Food was ok.  Had the Patty Melt, FF with Parmesan Cheese which is a rip off that you have to pay additional for the flavor, Chili and a Orange Milk Shake.  Once you get your food, you will never see your server again, they slap down the bill and walk away."}
{"text":"Steak 'n Shake is somewhere between fast food and a chain diner. We were seated quickly, and the woman who served us came to our table quickly. She was patient and helpful during ordering. Given how empty this place was, our drinks could have come a little quicker, and our food was a little on the slow side.  One of us ordered breakfast, while the other two ordered lunch. Eggs which were ordered \"over easy\" were cooked almost hard. The serving of bacon could have been more generous, and the silver dollar potatoes were frozen, with onions (something which could have been purchased in bulk for cheap at a supermarket).  The four stars is a compromise between the three I'd give (largely for the food preparation) and the feelings of the other two members of our party: two, teen-aged burger fans with not particularly demanding palates.  The what3words location for this Steak 'n Shake is: grew.dragon.loyal  https://map.what3words.com/grew.dragon.loyal"}
{"text":"Ordered the original burger... bun was dry, meat was super thin, and cheese not melted.  Fries were skinny, and u can tell they were frozen, not fresh.  Cute decor and great service, but we were disappointed with the burger and fries.  We also shared a banana shake.  U couldn't really taste the banana... it was ok tasting. Doubt we will be back..."}
{"text":"Good burgers but the server was terrible. Unnecessary attitude & she was really slow. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.  I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?  Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.  This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.  Next trip to Pgh is going to feature Steak and Shake - I guarantee it."}
{"text":"If you need a scooby snack (basically you're hungry but not starving) then I think that this is a okay stop.  Their menu is reasonably priced and they have four combo meals that are $4.00.  You can also add side items such as a garden salad, onion rings, bowl of chilli, etc. for $1.25.  They have some crazy combination such as the burger with guacamole with a guacamole ranch sauce...for some reason I just think this would give someone bubble guts (sorry I just think that).  One of my favorites, only b/c I order it every time I come here, is the Buttery Wisconsin Burger.  It's two steak patties (the patties are not very big or thick so it's really like having one regular size patty), cheese in between, sauteed onions with a butter sauce.  This one I know is good so I can recommend that.  The fires are string cut; reminds me of when you could buy potato strings in the can...shows my age huh. Now this place is very kid friendly.  Every time we come here there's a group of cheerleaders, basketball, or soccer team here eating, along with families with small cuties (a lot of babies).  So it's noisy with plenty of crying...I'm just saying that if you're looking for something a little more quieter or if you just don't like kids then this is not the place for u..."}
{"text":"This would have only been 1 star if their shakes weren't so yummy and ginormous. I like their variety on the menu and I like the retro decor. We had coupons too, which was nice! My ice water had chocolate smeared all over the inside of the glass, it was nasty. The waitress didn't compensate whatsoever she barely apologized when we asked for another water. The sandwiches were lame, just lacking in flavor completely. Hubby ordered the Oktoberfest steak burger and they were out of pretzel buns, he ordered it a anyway and it was just soggy and overrated. I got the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger and it was like a gray burger with barely any cheese. He had fries that were not seasoned at all and near cold and I had coleslaw that had cabbage practically floating in the coleslaw sauce... I'm sure it was just an off day or the location was off... We will return but not for a while. :-("}
{"text":"I have eaten at Steak and Shake in states throughout the south and midwest, as well as in Vegas.  So my son and I were very excited to spot one while we were driving down Mill Avenue today.  This is definitely different than any location I have visited in the past.  We found the resturant uncrowded and fairly clean.  Ordering was unique with a computer ordering system that you had to pay by credit card (I didn't see an option to use cash or even google wallet).  The menu is definitely limited, but they have burgers, fries with options, and a limited shake menu.  We received our food, made fresh, in a resonable amount of time.  It was prepared properly and tasted decent.  We didn't eat our food there, so I am not sure if the fries would have been crispy if we had eaten them immediately, but they were limp and soggy.  Bottom line, I wouldn't make a special trip to go there but if I were on Mill I might give it another try.  But with Chuckbox so close it's a hard sell."}
{"text":"Why is the service here always so bad?  It doesn't matter what time or how many/few customers there are.  I got seated and given a drink fairly quickly but that was a half hour ago and I am the ONLY person eating here.  There must be 12 employees doing god know what.  I would like to eat here but am just going to walk out."}
{"text":"I purposely have not visited a Steak 'n Shake in a while.  I was never overly pleased.  This visit was no different.  This is the only such restaurant in Las Vegas.  Patronage was very good on the evening of my visit.  Service was prompt and our server was polite and attentive.  Unfortunately, the food left a LOT to be desired.  I don't have a reason for why the bread of my grilled chicken sandwich fell apart when I first picked it up.  It continued to fall apart as if the bread came from the bottom of the bag and was damaged from too much handling.  The thin fries were nah. Needless to say, I hope I never visit this restaurant chain again.  Perhaps you may have a better exeprience as the menu is varied and the milkshakes looked appetizing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst drive thru in mankind! Avoid at all costs at  Any time. no matter what time you get here you will have to wait and then they have you move up to wait and they bring the sandwich out."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price, but the pictures in the menu = false advertisement.  We didn't wait as long as we expected (it was probably around 35 minutes), but considering there were around 4-5 empty tables when we walked in, I was a little peeved.  Their waitstaff was pretty slow (Edward!), so I understand their desire to not overload the waiters.  I was expecting it to be $13 per burger because of the pictures in the menu (HUGE burgers!), but prices were low and the burgers were also haha.  The BF and I together only spent $16 for a satisfying meal!  We both got upgraded sides (chili cheese fries and onion rings) and split a shake.  For $16, I think that's pretty damn good.  I enjoyed my patty melt--it was simple, but nothing life-changing.  I liked the chili on my fries, but the cheese was fake, melty nacho cheese.  I wanted some real, shredded cheddar!  We got the dark chocolate shake, and it was decent.  Once again, not life-changing.  I still love me some In-n-out, so unless the wait gets shorter and burgers get bigger, I'd rather spend my money there."}
{"text":"Big disappointment! I thought by the long line the food would be pretty good, but I was very wrong. We ordered take-out and when I got back to my room the chili beans had a 1/4 inch layer of fat that had already set on the top of the container - gross!!! In n out is way better and has more flavor and fresh ingredients. Everything was saturated in grease. When they say \"buttery\" they mean greasy. My husband said the beans and burger had the same \"tang\" to it. The young woman who took my order was very nice but I won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Ok, let me just say the milk shake I ordered was great even though it was half melted from sitting so long. I really want to give these guys a good rating, but with the experience I had, I am sorry to say I am not able to do that. The place was a little busy, but not bad so there was no excuse for the service I had.  We sat down and waited for 16 minutes before we saw any sign of a waitress in our section.  She came over and asked to take our order, she asked me what I wanted and I replied asking for a special dark chocolate shake (it looked like she was writing it down) then turned to my husband and asked him what he wanted and he ordered the mint oreo cookie shake, then much to my disbelief she turns to me and asks me again, \"What would you like?\".  I thought to myself, Really?  My husband looked at me and we were both in disbelief.  I replied to her, ah you mean in addition to what I already ordered, her reply, no what do you want, so I went through it again, but much slower (Special Dark Chocolate shake and water).  Off she went.  We waited another 10 minutes and no water, so I asked again, 5 minutes later out she came with no water or shakes.  I went to the counter and complained to the manager and asked for my water.  I went to sit down and 8 minutes later our shakes come and this waitress gives us our shakes while telling us we won't be receiving a bill because I complained to her manager, then threw the straws, turned around and walked off. I was surprised the manager comped the shakes which was very nice, but the attitude of that waitress and her dismal performance has got to go.  Cat, I think it is short for Cathy needs to find another line of work. I would not go back to this place, due to the treatment from the waitress.  She was awful and rude."}
{"text":"The food here is subpar. The shakes aren't well made and they don't taste that good. The burgers are terrible! They're cooked so well down that they're basically dust. Terrible fries, they taste like cardboard. I've had the cookies and cream shake and it was alright. I've had the Peanut butter Cup shake and it hardly tasted like peanut butter. Terrible food! The service is bad too! Eight of us came in and the hostess looked at us like \"I have to serve that?\" That's horribly rude and I didn't appreciate her attitude."}
{"text":"the interior reminds me of Johnny Rockets. This place is alright for burgers and has good prices. If you are in the Southpoint casino and looking for reasonably priced food, its worth a stop. They also have seasoning for fries/burgers, but I didn't try it."}
{"text":"Even for what it is--burgers and fries--the food is extremely salty. Every time I come here I get bites with pockets of salt, and others that taste normal. With the reputation that steak n shake has in other states, I wanted to like this place. But I don't think I can take it any more. Maybe one day I can taste food from a real steak n shake... Until then, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Back in the Sad Days, I would have to wait an entire year to go to Steak n Shake. I would travel to Indianapolis and eat there as much as I possibly could because I knew I would not be there again for another year.  Ladies and Gentlemen, my life was lived improperly. No man should be deprived of steak burgers and oreo milkshakes for a whole year and thus Las Vegas - specifically the South Point Hotel and Casino (which fortuitously happens to be one of the FIRST hotels you reach coming from Los Angeles) has stormed its way into my life and slapped my hopes and dreams into reality.   Frisco Melt is now on crunchy sourdough - IMPROVEMENT the $4 meal deals are still intact - EXCELLENT VALUE Happy Hour of half-priced shakes - POSITIVE ENERGY EVERYWHERE  This has instantly become a staple of mine and I will literally go to vegas more often simply because of this restaurant. If I could give this six stars I would."}
{"text":"If there was a minus, I would give it a -5.  The service is consistently slow.  I have gone in several times just for a milkshake, 15 minutes later, I am still waiting.  Today, I thought I would try something different, I phoned in my order. As they directed, I went into pick it up. I waited over 15 minutes for someone to approach me. Took my money but never gave me my order. 10 minutes later, I received a melted milkshake. When I told them it was melted, they alleged they had just made it even though I saw it sitting from the time I entered. I asked for them to make it again and it tasted like nothing. It was suppose to be chocolate but they forgot to put the chocolate in.  I would not recommend this. Very poorly run."}
{"text":"Usually decently busy if not just plain busy. I typically go with friends for a movie night at Southpoint and then here for dinner right afterwards.   Always love the shakes, and they have a new one with Nutella! Hard to go wrong with Nutella, right?   Jalapeño crunch sandwich is my to-go order along with plain fries (just add their table seasonings). It's always a dinner that makes me feel bad about it afterwards but yet I always go back.   This relationship is a forever one.   Service is usually just what's expected. Nothing to elaborate on there."}
{"text":"We ate here this past Saturday while out on a motorcycle ride. I've always wanted to try it, but never had, I'm so glad we did. Staff was very friendly and attentive, never had to ask for anything always brought out and with a smile. My husband and I ordered the Triple burger and Hot dog to share, so we could have a variety to taste. Burger and fries where excellent, moist, hot and fresh. The hot dog, however, I did not like, it was hot and fresh, but I'm a snob about hot dogs, if it's not a Nathans or Costco dog I do not like them. There was plenty of food on my plate, so much in fact that I didn't finish my food and a milkshake was out of the question. I was disappointed because I really wanted to try a birthday cake shake, I recommend just going for the shake, they looked huge and amazing. And on a final note the prices cannot be beat, my husband and I ate for 12.00, well 18 including tip. This wait staff earns there tips. We will return again and again. I'm ready for my milkshake. One more thing I must mention we went during the weekend that Concord was hosting Carolina Rebellion and we had no wait, however, when we left it was getting busy, but they where handling it well."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! Damaris H. is awesome. Really attentive and all around wonderful server. Definitely a pleasure having her as our server. First time coming here and will most definitely recommended to others. Burgers are delicious and service was fantastic. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  My boyfriend keeps raving about this place, I've tried it twice now and I really don't see what the big deal is..which is probably because they are lacking in veggie and fish options. Both times I've come here I always wonder how much more business they would get if they had a veggie patty of some sort. The service is slow and its always crowded because its in front of the mall. It took forever to get a seat for 2, I will not be coming on weekends ever again.    The last time I was here I got the veggie melt with some parmesan fries while my bf got a chicken jalapeño crunch burger. It felt like forever to get our food, once we actually did get the food we ordered we had to send it back because the chicken sandwich we requested was made with beef. They fixed it quickly though.   I love fries...and wasn't impressed. The serving was a small side of thin shoe string fries. The seasoning was nice, and I like the fry seasoning steak n shake had on the table...Probably get an extra order of fries if you are a fattie like me, there is a cajun seasoning which sounds yummy. The veggie melt itself was kind of soggy and lacking flavor though packed with a lot of veggies, mainly mushrooms and guac. They also cheaped out on my cheese and gave me american cheese instead of the pepper jack which was in the menu description, not cool. My bf enjoyed his burger though.  Also ordered one of their infamous shakes here and again, wasn't impressed. We got the snickers shake to split since we were already stuffed. The consistency of the shake was bad and the vanilla base didn't taste very good. I was expecting a shake on par with DQs blizzards...so not the case.   So far I've been off put by Steak n Shake, I'll only come here to hopefully get a large serving of fries and appease my bf's burger craving. So please, Steak n Shake, get a veggie patty on that menu...and I'm sure my updated rating will go up."}
{"text":"Sub par effort in food and staff here at Steak n Shake.  To their credit it was late...but this is Mill Avenue, right?    I was disappointed in the lack cleanliness this place had.  When we walked in, there was an employee working on the floors in the corner but the tables need wayyy more attention.  This place messy, napkins all over, and random fries under chairs and tables.  The person who took my order was checked out, pretty much didn't want anything to do with us.    The food was put together in what seemed like a rush, and furthered my decision to probably never come back.  Outside it looks appealing, until you come in and experience it."}
{"text":"I ordered the original double n' cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake. Seriously, what is the the hype? You Mid-Westeners need to come to Southern California or Nevada and try what a regular burger is all about at INNO. The fries are puny. The shake was ok. Nothing special. I've had much better shakes at INNO or Baker's in California. Steak N' Shake needs to put out a better product if they want to succeed in Santa Monica. One good point I do give them is the friendliness of their staff at their Vegas location in the South Point."}
{"text":"Out of desperation and hunger I actually went back.  I drive Uber.  If possible its even gotten worse.  I spent $9 on an awful burger, fries and Coke.  Way better off going to Rallys at half the price.  I will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Its clean, open 24/7 with hot shoe string fries and creative milkshakes. What else do you want in life??"}
{"text":"Walk in and barely anybody was in there and all the waiters were standing around talking telling each other to eat different stuff. Most of the tables are covered in dirty dishes and the waiter had to clean and wipe down a chair for my girlfriend and I to sit. We never got forks, spoons, etc. We ordered milkshakes and got them in to go cups as the waiter said they didn't have clean cups. We got our food extremely fast which we enjoyed but my burger was dry and burnt along with barely any ketchup. Be a long time before I come back."}
{"text":"This gets five-stars because I'm rating it against the same kind of eating establishments, not against Michelin star restaurants.  Let me explain:  I miss Steak 'n Shake.  I used to eat there in Atlanta and in Louisville.  I love their little burgers and those awesome shoestring fries!  In reading some of the reviews here, I was wary, but I had to go . . . when would I get my next chance???  Yes, the line can be long (but, in my mind, that's usually a GOOD sign - they can only do what they can do with the space they have and the speed of the diners).  I avoided this by going just before noon.    My server was excellent - she immediately came over and got my drink order and then returned with my coke and took my food order.  Food came hot off the grill/fryer and in a very short time.  The server was attentive, friendly, smiling and just perfect (the rest of the folks at South Point Hotel and Casino could learn from her).  The food was just as I remember it from years past - and, I had a wonderful time reminiscing about those past experiences and the friends I shared them with . . .  I'd go back!  Really good experience!"}
{"text":"Well, being from the MidWest, I was super excited, on our cross-country road trip (two summers ago) to introduce my own family to SnS.  It did not disappoint and we had SnS atleast 4 times during the 3 week outing.  The following year (last year) when we repeated that trip, we were sure to stop by SnS (kids were practically begging).  On that trip, we even asked them when they might bring one our way.  Little did I know that they had already planned it.  When I told my kids that Steak 'n Shake would, indeed, open a restaurant in the valley, they couldn't wait.  Well, after discovering that it was already opened, my wife and I ventured out to the SnS Signature restaurant to enjoy some great fast food.  I read the reviews on Yelp (prior to heading out) and prepared her for the reality that the experience would not be like we were used to.  Having said that, we pleased with the food we received.  I ordered the Original and my wife had the Western BBQ & Bacon.  The food was received promptly, and was delicious.  My only comment (as it relates to the food) would be a lack of consistency in the fries.  Because they are cut so thin (shoestring) they varied from very crispy (almost burnt) to something more palatable.  The service was great (on par with what you might expect to find in other \"counter-service\" restaurants.  It definitely was not the Steak 'n Shake experience that we were used to, but given the choice between not having a local SnS and having to drive several hours to get the full SnS menu / experience, I think SnS Signature is an acceptable alternative (for now).  I do, however, echo the sentiments of others requesting that SnS bring the full diner experience to AZ."}
{"text":"How happy am I??!!  I have waited for this day to come for over 10 years (since I moved here from the 'burbs of Chi-Town.  It tasted just like heaven I had my usual- Frisco Melt, cheese fries and a cup of chili. It was...... Heavenly. I love you so much Steak N Shake, enough to marry you if I could. I'll be back.  Sooner than later."}
{"text":"The burgers are a bit thin, but very good and not dry. French fries are thin and crisp and you get to choose add-on flavors for a price.  Or first visit, we had a very nice & attentive young gentleman serving us. There were only 4 of us dining at the time.  Our second visit on our last day in Vegas, there were 15 of us all spread out occupying 3 tables. We had a woman serving our party. Maybe she was overwhelmed, but the service was horrible. She kept on forgetting my son's soda. She never cracked a smile either."}
{"text":"What can you say about a place you can get a great burger and fries for $4?? The garlic burger was a bit greasy but the regular fries were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Fake and shake!! Not like the original at all! Where's breakfast and coffee? Where's the 5 way chili Mac? Where's the best shoe string fries ever made? I'm highly disappointed. Why bring SNS to Arizona if you aren't going to do it right? I already have plenty of burger places to choose from, I wanted the variety that came with steak and shake and I got burgers, fries and shakes to choose from? Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"Ok, the burgers are good, but the fries are too much like matchsticks super thin and not great but the onion rings we're good. The taco salad was awful because it's lacking everything along with flavor, just order what they specialize in which is burgers then you won't be disappointed like I was.  This place would be good if I were drunk, I suppose if they focused on flavor and quality and not nickle and diming for things like ranch dressing, the place could be better."}
{"text":"I went to Steak and shake for the first time and it was better than I had been told.   I did not know what to expect other than they have chili and burgers and some other things too.   I asked the server for a recommendation. He said the signature burger is the best flavor, he even gets it with no cheese. And the flavored fries: Parmesan garlic or sea salt and pepper are both great.   I got my food and tasted the burger. The patty was flavorful, juicy and crispy on the outside. The toppings a great addition.   They fries were strong but very tasty. I want to try all the flavors.   The manager came by to check on the taste and cleared our trays for us after we finished."}
{"text":"I have been told my many about how great the food at this location has always been. And the reputation definitely held its ground in terms of the food!! However, the service absolutely left a little to be desired. The employees seemed unhappy in general and not enthusiastic enough for the type of establishment and reputation this location currently has. Bummer, as it would have been great!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review This place is a really a hit or miss fast food restaurant. There are times here where I want to gouge my eyes out for instance I came at 11 AM and tried to go through the drive-through. There was only one car ahead of me and he put his order in and drove to the window. Normally you would expect that you could put your order in afterwards however I couldn't understand the gentleman on the speaker and after I gave him my full order he told me please wait. Another four-minute passes no one comes back on the speaker. Now the cars behind me start honking and I just get annoyed and drive off. Other times the food is quite fresh and the milkshakes are handed dipped. Although the other half of the time the food is just dripping in grease. So take your pick whether you're lucky to get the good of the bad, but this is ultimately still fast food  Pros: inexpensive, great milk shakes  Cons: poor service at times, long drive thru wait times, greasy food  Hidden deals: Weekly mailers with coupons. Your best bet is to use the 4.99 for the double steak burger, fries, and a classic milk shake. So much cheaper and better than McD. Sign up for the app and pay with app to get a milk shake free the first time and 5 dollars back for every 50 you spend.

{"text":"I heard Steak & Shake was available on west coast, and when I visited the South Point hotel; I was pretty excited!!  I heard from the concierge that the S&S was mostly busy at night.  I went around 2 pm and was served almost immediately and lunch was ready in under 10 minutes.   S&S employees were very pleasant and helpful. They recommend the double cheeseburger.  I ordered the double cheeseburger with extra pickles LOL.  This was the first experience of S&S was awesome! The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were fantastic as well! Two thumbs up for S&S!"}
{"text":"The best food and service! First time here!! and it's nice and clean.christan in the front was super friendly and knowledgeable about the food.thank you I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Let me be very blunt, this place is horrible. The burgers are just down right bad. They dont cook to temp only well well done. You could get a better burger at Wendy's. The milk shakes suck. Had to send mine back twice. No flavor at all full of ice shards. Ice cream tasted freezer burnt. Will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped by the drive thru a few times to get dessert and some of those mini burgers (shooters). The food was outstanding each time I went, I got the chipotle shooters, those little burgers had a kick to them. Ordered a hot fudge sundae once it was pretty epic. Fries were good too. Haven't had a bad experience."}
{"text":"2 stars because of the shake quality and one employee was going around cleaning tables and the floors.   Now this is how my 2nd experience at this \"Stake n Shake\" went. The quotes because it barely deserves the name stake n shake. Now before I took the time to drive 21 minutes to this so called establishment, I called them to ask if it was possible to not have a lot of salt on my fries and if they could be less done. The lady said, \"yes we can do that.\" Now I'm not super trusting of fast food employees in a college town. So I asked, \"are you sure because it will be a 20 minute drive to get there and there are a lot of bad reviews and I don't want to be disappointed.\" She assured me that it was possible so I drove over and paid the meter.   When I walked inside the first thing I saw was 2 rugged looking people with dirty hair and paint covered dirty pants by the door. One sitting on the floor leaning on his big bag. I think they were homeless. I didn't smell anything though so maybe they just were idk but they looked very homeless. Then I went to order.   When I ordered I asked for a big strawberry shake which turns out to just be a regular and a big fry which was a large. I asked for the fries to not have a lot of salt and for them to be less cooked. I also asked for cheese on the side. The chick said okay and gave me a pager thing.   *the only reason I got just fries and a shake is because they don't have chicken tenders which is what I get at every other stake n shake with a side of honey mustard*  I waited about 5 minutes and got my food. The fries were just like everyone else's except with little salt. They were over done and okay. Not the best. The cheese is tiny and the fries are huge. And it costs $0.53 to get another tiny side of cheese. I felt robbed. Now the shake was good. It tasted like the shakes back home and like the ones at every other stake n shake I have been to in my life.   When I was done eating this food I looked for napkins. There were no napkins on the tables or by the soda area where you get the straws and stuff. I finally found a single napkin holder under the wine holder to the far left of the counter. That's sad. This second chance for this place was wasted. I regret going here and will never do so again.  TLDR: NOT THE REAL DEAL! No chicken tenders, over done fries, and a waste of time."}
{"text":"I was here for a promotional event, the managers were very friendly and helpful.  The fries were fantastic!! The burger was ok, not the greatest, my friend said the milkshakes were very yummy!  They looked like the perfect consistency and delicious.The dining room is a bit cramped but it's not meant for sit and be served food so it's no big deal."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The line goes very quick. You can order it and take it with you also. The service is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is a great bargain.  The milkshakes are the real thing, and are among the best in the area.  The breakfast menu is a real value. The Portobello Sausage Skillet is a delight.  The hamburgers are delicious.  This location is usually very busy between 11am and 8pm, which means you are going to wait for a table and they may not be able to keep up with cleaning the tables.  I recommend this chain for a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  There have been people who have been persuading me to go here, convincing me its going to be revolutionary for a burger joint. Seeing as how burgers are generally redundant as is to me, I decided to take a shot.   The only thing I've found good was the mint milkshake, and that was it. Fries were bland, meat was bland, the whole burger was nothing special. I think their sauces actually attempt to make up for how bland their patties are, because honestly I could have gotten the same stuff for $3 cheaper elsewhere.   The location is fairly busy, and because of this, a little bit of a wait for both seating and take-out. The staff is fairly friendly and attentive. I don't see what is so great about Steak 'N Shake, it really wasn't anything special to myself."}
{"text":"I woke up yesterday morning with three words on my mind: \"STEAK AND SHAKE.\"  Working across the street from this location, I was getting a little worried (okay, a lot worried) as the morning dragged on and my inbox became flooded with the e-mails of equally concerned co-workers panicking about the long line that was building up ahead of the grand opening. I work with quite a few people from the east coast, who had been telling me nothing but good things about the Steak 'n Shake chain ever since we found out one was opening on Mill. Luckily, once doors opened at 11 the line moved through quite quickly and me and my equally hungry coworkers had a window to grab our long-awaited fast food before the next wave started around noon.  I ordered the Original (it being opening day and my first time at a Steak 'n Shake, I had to go with the signature) with fries and a Cookies and Cream milkshake (trust me, you'll want to order the milkshake). Within ten minutes, my burgers and fries were gone and I was onto the milkshake. Hey, I'd pretty much been hungry all morning and the panic about the line didn't hurt.  I'd say this is comparable to an In 'N Out, but with a slightly pricier menu and more selection. I'm sure opening day won't be anywhere close to the last time I order from here."}
{"text":"Nice promotion with 1/2 price milk shakes. No purchased needed. Very good, but not thick as we remember."}
{"text":"If there was a negative 5 star that's what this restaurant deserves. I ordered 5 milkshakes at 6:40pm, I asked how long it would take the lady at the register said the wait will be 15 minutes. So I waited until 7:05pm and my number still was not ready. A man and his 3 children ordered food and a couple shakes their order was number 706, while order 750 was already called. The service here is ridiculously slow. And my milkshake we're sitting on the counter for 5 minutes melting. I do not recommend going to this Steak 'n Shake. I want my money back."}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for charred hamburger. The bottle of seasoning on the table was a cute idea bc lord knows it didn't have any seasoning on it. The waitress kept saying that they were backed up but when I looked around there wasn't a lot of people there. However they (waitresses) were nice and apologetic. But when I think of steak sandwiches I didn't think of what I got."}
{"text":"Why is there no Steak N Shake in California?? WHY?  I got the original triple patty burger and a patty melt. I don't know what there is to say except: Forget any other burger joint that you've ever come to know and love, for words do not do this place justice--you just have to have a burger from here before you die, but hopefully sooner.   MAKE THIS A MUST-STOP DESTINATION ON YOUR WAY TO OR BACK FROM VEGAS! It's located in the South Point casino about 15 minutes before you hit the strip. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.   Milkshakes are, however, another story.   You're welcome."}
{"text":"Didn't put our order in and then blamed it on a error with the printer..burger was cold, chili was cold and fries were luke warm but do I expect from steak and shake!! Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"The food was good as always. Our server De Angelo was awesome. The place was packed with a waiting line. The hostess couldn't even lend a helping hand to clean off the tables. There was only 1 bus person trying to keep up. Instead of helping, the hostess was telling her which table to clean off."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars.  Nothing to write home about.  Shakes are average and burger is ok.  The parties are very small and flat so don't let the idea of a double scare you off.  The bun on mine fell apart, but it saved me the carbs! The bacon is the real cheap kind with strong pork flavor.   Not bad for price.  2 burgers, 2 shakes, onion rings, shoestring fries and coleslaw was about $25"}
{"text":"I love their strawberry shakes and if you get there between 2 and 5 pm Monday through Friday they are 2 bucks!"}
{"text":"I am from Missouri and grew up on Steak N Shake... recently moved to California and no Steak N Shake around , while visiting in Vegas this weekend I got to have Steak N Shake and it was delicious. This location is busy but it is clean and friendly staff and great food and fast and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but time waiting for the food took awhile. But at the end was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for late night food runs pretty much because it's the only place open until 3am. they have not yet till today messed up a order for me."}
{"text":"I was eager to sample the offerings of South Point's newest culinary addition, Steak 'n Shake, but until very recently was deterred by reports of huge lines just to get inside the restaurant.  On this night we were lucky, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were admitted to the inner sanctum.  The place was bright and lively, and packed with happy people.  Servers were scrambling quickly about delivering steakburgers and tantalizing-looking milk shakes to the eager awaiting diners seated at white-topped tables and booths.  Huge photographs of food preparers clad in white 50s-style uniforms with cocked military-style caps adorned the back wall, looking not much different from their present-day counterparts.  Diane and I were both quite hungry after a long drive from California; we hadn't eaten for several hours; and of course I had to order mightily to round out a good review of various kinds of fast food fare.  So, we showed little restraint.  I noted that canned chili was sold on premises.  And, I logically reasoned that any restaurant that cans and sells its chili out the door must make a memorable species of the hot stuff.  And, I am a sucker for good homemade chili--with beans or not.  So, I opened with a side of Genuine Chili with onions but no cheese.  As luck would have it, this chili came with beans, which is the way I prefer.  It was quite good, with a lot of liquid goodness, and a noticeable but not extreme backbite to tickle the throat on the way down.  As a testament to the quality of this chili, I ate all that was set before me, and took a can home that I enjoyed as part of my lunch the very next day.  Next up was a Chicago-style Frank & Fries.  The dog contained a slightly split all-beef wiener, classic emerald green relish, chopped white onions, two sport peppers, and a slice of ripe tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  After downing one complete sport pepper, it seemed like my stomach had turned into a hearth with a log fully ablaze inside it.  So, I elected to bypass the second pepper.  The hot dog was very, very good.  But I would have preferred an untoasted soft bun, and some juiciness had probably escaped where the meat had been sliced.  But the dog was still juicy.  Fries were shoestring style, slightly crispy, and tasty enough.  And, although I couldn't get my Original Double Steakburger with Cheese & Fries (I told you I lacked restraint in ordering on this night!) made even close to medium-rare, it was still fairly juicy and tasty with two hamburger patties, crunchy circling strands of white onion, a tomato slice, a couple of pickles, a slice of orange cheese, fresh lettuce, and tomato ketchup added.  But the real highlights of this particular meal hands down were the two majestic milk shakes.  We each had a hand-dipped \"specialty shake\"--which means the most expensive variety served.  Diane selected Double Chocolate Fudge, which was really chocolatey and naturally enhanced by hot fudge; and I chose Butter Pecan.  As luscious as that shake was, it had a surprise in store for me that made it probably the best milk shake I have ever had the pleasure of savoring.  For, it was dotted with small bits of pecan.  But these tiny pecan pieces were unlike any I had tasted before.  They were more like pecan seeds that when bit into simply burst with the flavor of pecan.  When at last I got through the cherries, whipped cream, and tall milk shake itself, about 100 of these morsels lay at the bottom of my milk shake glass.  And, I just scooped them up repeatedly with the long spoon provided, and crunched them on the roof of my mouth in spoonfuls, letting the bursts of intense pecan flavor lazily wash down my throat, until at last all were gone.  A heavenly end to a fine fast food meal!"}
{"text":"Unlike many of the reviews that have been written about this Steak 'n Shake, I have enjoyed all of my experiences here. Whether it is a late night run or just after a soccer game, I can confidently say this place is a fine eating establishment. I normally get the $5 cheeseburger, fries, and a side of honey mustard which has quickly become one of my favorite meals from any restaurant. But the biggest thing that makes this review go from 4 stars to 5 is the waitress we seem to always get, Doris. Every single time my friends and I have shown up while she is working, we have never been disappointed. So to sum this all up, I really enjoy this Steak 'n Shake and can't seem to understand why it has received so many poor reviews throughout the years."}
{"text":"Been here a few times recently and it's much better. The burgers and onion rings have been fresh and hot. Service has been much better as well they stop by the table much more often to check if you need anything."}
{"text":"Philly burger is great, but service is less than stellar but honestly u blame the cooks in the back.  If the food isn't right there's only so much the server can do. This particular steak and shake is better than the rest."}
{"text":"Our first visit came about because I had signed up for their online club and they emailed my hubby a coupon for his birthday. The coupon was for a double cheeseburger with cheese fries so we said why not check it out. We sure are glad we did as it was a fun and delicious experience for us.  We really enjoy the old nostalgic retro look and feel this cute burger and shake shop has.  Their food is very good quality as my fresh 50's style burger was juicy and insane flavorful. My mouth went into a full on orgasm after the first bite, that was fast!  We had a great experience and will be back for sure as the service was great as well. Julio our server was fantastic!  We happen to stop by during happy hour from 2-4 and all drinks and shakes are 50% off. My southern sweet iced tea with unlimited refills cost 50 cents! It was some of the best sweet tea I have ever had the pleasure of chugging down.   What we ordered:  Jalapeno Crunch, A Double Steakburger seasoned on a fiery hot grill with pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, fresh salsa and jalapenos, all topped with French fried onions, served with fries.  The Original Double 'n Cheese the popular Steakburger! Two hot-off-the-grill Steakburgers with American cheese on a toasted bun and your choice of toppings. Served with fries.  Butterfinger milkshake, All the goodness of a real Butterfinger candy bar can be found in this hand-dipped milk shake."}
{"text":"Way better than Five Guys and definitely gives In'N'Out a run for its money not to mention fries are almost as awesome too.   Meals starting at $4. Kids ate free all weekend - I'm late I know, sorry.  This was the first time I actually sat down inside and ate and woah did they make an impression. I don't know if it's every location, but this Concord Mills one seats you. A waiter then takes your order and brings out the food.   The waiter might I add, was strangely super curteous and nice. Way too polite that it was awkward. So much that I had a momentary lapse and thought I was back at the Capital Grille!   Their customer service just put many real sit down restaurants to shame.  As I looked around, I noticed no one left a tip, so I didn't leave one either. Are we not supposed to? This is a place I don't mind leaving a tip one bit.  -Update-  My friend did leave a tip at the register =)"}
{"text":"Full service restaurant. Ordered a burger and a dog. Burger was a little better than an average fast food burger. Dog was pretty good."}
{"text":"I went once and once was enough. The service sucked. The food was not even ok. I might give it .5 star if I could. I have not been nor will be back. I sat by the service station and all I heard were employees whining about what they had to do or didn't want to. One specifically was trying to pay others to do her job. I can't believe people go back because Penn Station is not far away. In fact I can't stand burger thing and would rather eat there."}
{"text":"The foods really good here I'm a big fan of the frisco melt and the western barbecue burger, and also the side by side shakes, but they're always crowded so it takes forever, weather you're inside or going through the drive through be prepared for a wait. Also the last time I was here the guy who was working seemed to have no clue about anything on the menu which seems kind of unprofessional."}
{"text":"An okay place!  The shakes were yummy!  My salad lacked taste!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. And even then, I was disappointed. The food was average, but the staff (with the exception of the manager) was awful, rude and lazy."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The prices were surprisingly affordable. I ordered from the $4 menu. Single steakburger with bacon. They serve plenty of fries with your burger as well. I didnt find anything great about the food but it is cheap. Also had the brownie with vanilla ice cream and the cookie with vanilla ice cream. The desserts were very good. The cookies and brownie were both very warm and soft."}
{"text":"Okay... I'm from the Midwest (Indiana) so I grew up with steak and shake. Hard to believe one had flown in under the radar without me hearing about it. Thanks to yelp I found this location and decided to try tonight.   First things first it's a stripped-down menu because it is not a full steak and shake. No waitress or servers here. Their menu was decent and I suggest you order the original steak burger with fries. The patties are very small so I suggest getting a triple.   Oh... THEY HAVE WINE and BEER! Crazy!  The food tasted great as well as the shake! I would suggest it to anybody who's looking for a good quick burger and shake! The place is clean and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place. I was supposed to write a review when I visited back in October, but I've been in a food coma from them till now lol jk. The burger was great. I've heard of people stand in line and waiting upwards of an hour to get a taste. I picked out as the South Point hotel has one right in the lobby. The shake was huge and left me sitting in the booth with a huge smile and the dilemma of whether I should try and walk or sit there and continue to smile...lol  I'd go back.. especially when I crave a good burger with that huge shake. The wait staff was very friendly and that made a big impact on my decision to dine in."}
{"text":"overall the burgers are nothing different than mcdonalds or burgerking etc although there more on the smaller side then those places. i do however like the fries better than the fast food places available however they are the shoe string type so wouldnt really call them french fries. also, what is going on with there ketchup? do they really not ever put it in the fridge? it tasted vile!!! reminds me of when my highschool would do that crap.... also, the service was nothing to write home about and for the sickly long lines i expected much much much more.   also, just a side note if you dont like the garlic/outback seasoning thing that they put on there fries make sure you tell them when you order not to put it on... since they automatically do even though the same seasoning is at your table... 0.o"}
{"text":"Wow.   Raw raw chicken tenders.  Unreal  Been getting burgers there. No problem. Brother got food poison from there. I didn't listen.  Raw chicken. Boyfriend choked.  Threw up.  Done. Game over.  The place should be closed"}
{"text":"Always horrible service and rude workers. Plus the restaurant is dirty and the last time I was there, there were bugs everywhere crawling around. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This is my second time in the row for late snacking. Very good prices n good foods. Love them.  Will definetely come back."}
{"text":"I have been dragged here a few times.  I can't eat any of the food here, but I like to look at the 50's tiling of the floors and counters. Good for late-night stops, but does not beat Denny's."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative rating, I would most definitely would. Tonight (07/28/17 @ 12:00 AM) is the third time we tried to dine in at this location and I don't even know why we keep giving it a try. First of all, the place was nowhere near being too busy. Sure there were diners but we should've have had to wait over 20 minutes to have a server come to our table. Well, 20 minutes passed and still nothing. The place is horrible. We've dined at daytime before and the service was good. The manager even looked right at us. Apparently it's more important to wipe tables than attend to diners at night here. I hope somebody from the company reads this comment and the other's bad reviews as well and hopefully take action. The place serves good food but their service really stinks. If you're only gonna provide good service at daytime, then maybe they should just NOT have it open 24 hours if the night staff won't be willing to work at all."}
{"text":"Checked into to get their Signature Shake and fries. The place would do better if they focus and improve their customer service. No complaints on the shake or the fries. They were good as usual!  The wait time was reasonable but not so friendly workers behind the desk or in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is/was hyped so much. Burgers where nothing special, not bad but really just plain. And what heck is up with shoe string fries they suck. That's the reason this place gets 3 stars tired of seeing shoe string fries."}
{"text":"Horrible service cold food and why did he wait til my food was gone to bring my shake never asked if we needed anything or if everything was ok not once"}
{"text":"A bang for your buck.  S&S plays a classic fast food diner with a separated take out area. Bow tie wearing servers are here to serve you while you dine in this classic-iconic looking restaurant filled with retro pictures, decor, and nostalgia.  S&S offers a variety of traditional fast food entrees from a classic cheeseburger to a cheesy frisco patty melt. For dessert, enjoy one of their many milkshakes with countless flavors and toppings. They have your traditional vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Additionally, they have many topping infused flavors such as cookie dough, m&m's, and Reese's cups. This restaurant does get pretty packed at peak times and the wait lines get backed up, especially during events, so plan accordingly!  Everything in their menu is very reasonably priced. For $4.99 I had the triple steak burger which included a French fries, extra for drink. I also had the peppermint chocolate shake for a little over 5 dollars. The burger was really good, the pattys are a bit thin so I recommend getting a triple or a double. The French fries, however, were not to my liking, often too thin and bland. The milkshakes makes up for it, very delicious and fills that sweet tooth craving!  Burgers, fries, shakes! What more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"My kids and I shared the Original with a Birthday Cake milkshake. The burger was delicious and the shake was amazing. Seriously, I want another shake ASAP! The fries were a little thin and crispy for my liking, but my kids had no trouble finishing off every last one.   The best part (after the milkshake) was the customer service. I knocked my shake off my table and they nicely offered to make me a new one for free. Then, when it was time to leave, one of the workers came out from behind the counter and helped me get a double stroller, two babies, and a milkshake out the door.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Milkshakes were great especially since you can get a half and half and strawberry and chocolate are my favorite. Their onion rings were nice and crispy.Their burger was only ok and their hot dog was so so, not warm and the bun was toasted but tasted stale. Their coleslaw is wayyyy to creamy and soggy, had to chuck it. Very busy too long a wait so we got take out."}
{"text":"They're really bad at fulfilling orders at this place! I had to repeat myself to the drive through speaker numerous times and my order was dangerously wrong.   I'm allergic to the onion powder that they use in ketchup so i intentionally left it out of my order. Thankfully i checked the burger before i ate it as i would of had a reaction! The girl at the drive through window failed to provide me with a receipt; however, it was approximately 1:50 PM. I intend on contacting corporate about this incident as it is absolutely inexcusable. The negligancance on behalf of this location's employee could have easily caused me a significant amount of harm."}
{"text":"Went to use the $2.99 credit for getting their app. Unfortunately, this location doesn't have the scanner for the app. Bummer! Luckily there wasn't a wait in the takeout line, so I ordered the patty melt that comes on rye. I always go with the option that comes on rye. It also comes with fries that I disliked a lot. They are tiny and mine weren't too fresh. Double bummer.  The patty melt was pretty good, and I added bacon for 99 cents, but for $9 it's a bit pricey. The sandwich needed more sauce to jack up the flavor.  It was an OK enough meal, but they have $4 meal deals that aren't on the menu that I should have tried instead. It did not live up to my expectations for an amazing patty melt!"}
{"text":"I'm fucking pissed! After months of missing this place I was having a late night craving and decided to drive the 15 minute drive, knowing that this is a place that's open 24/7...only to find them closed, leaving me more than disappointed. Not to mention seeing the workers inside enjoying the ever so tasty burgers. I double checked to see if I was wrong but no, the hours still read 24/7. Fuck you steak n slut."}
{"text":"Thoughtful service.  Yummy shakes and burgers.  Not a huge fan of their fries; though hubby likes them.  The Spaghetti Chilli is also one of his faves.  Enjoyed the Rodeo crowd last night immensely!  Giddy up!"}
{"text":"Had the truffle burger it was amazing! Service was ok. Great place if you are staying close to the hooters hotel."}
{"text":"I will avoid this place at all costs, but sometime it's the only thing open late at night."}
{"text":"It took a long time for our order to be taken and much longer waiting for our food about 1 hour and the meat seemed greasy. People are loud here?"}
{"text":"Being that this is a brand new facility I would think they'd be on their A Game... If it was it's a disappointment.  I walked in, checked out the menu then proceeded to the order counter.  The order taker just looked at me. No greeting at all.  I ordered the Original Double and a shake.  The order taker (Briana) just dazed off into the distance. After she snapped out of it she asked for my order again so I repeated myself.  After paying, she gave me a cup cor the soda fountain.  I had to remind her that I ordered a Shake and then checked my receipt to see if she rung it up correctly.  Thankfully she did.  There was nothing else said.  No \"thank you\" and nothing about how long I'd have to wait so I was confused as to whether I should take a seat or not.  Almost every table was a bit dirty when I walked into the dining area, however it was all cleaned up within a couple of minutes, which is good, but I prefer to be seated at a table I like rather than a table just because is one of the few clean ones.  I guess it was just bad timing for me.  The food was ok, similar to Fabulous Freddy's in taste and price.  My only visit to a Steak and Shake in recent years was to their original Las Vegas location at South Pointe resort.  The difference is night and day, as that location is jammed all of the time, the staff more friendly and harder working, and the food may even be a tad better   Hopefully this place will pick up it's attitude and gain more business.  In the meantime I see no special reason to pass by several other burger joints to come here."}
{"text":"We come fairly often with grandchildren and they always like it. They're young and enjoy coloring as they await their meals. The hats for the kids are fun along with the cardboard cars they enjoy assembling. The milk shakes are always great."}
{"text":"So I had never heard of Steak 'n Shake but I guess it's something big in the Midwest. Super friendly service here at the Mill Avenue location and dynamite burgers. You've got your choice of all kinds of different styles and toppings which is nice. The fries are super crispy (perfect) and nicely portioned. Good music playing while we were there and the place is clean! Oh, and by the way... the milkshakes are phenomenal. Don't miss 'em. Especially the salted caramel pretzel milkshake. OMG."}
{"text":"If you order the royale, you cannot request an over easy egg. Fried only and over done.  So I have this love, hate affair with all things diner. I love the nostalgia and the feel. I typically hate the food.  The burgers here were just okay for me. It was hard for me to love and/or enjoy because I so bad wanted the Royale burger with my egg yolk all nice and runny but they couldn't and wouldn't make it like that. Something about health regulations. Must be all the old people and kids that eat there or something. Please explain why some places can do this and others cannot. However the patty was pretty moist and juicy and the toppings fresh and good.  The fries were good, as long as they were hot. Once they got cold, forget about it. It was just not good.  I also ordered a milkshake and I have to say one of the worse ever. I don't know what I was expecting because everyone was saying that their milkshakes were bomb. But they truly were the nastiest part of my lunch.  I took it to go to be polite and threw it in the trash when no one was looking. It was like it was made from old ice cream that had melted and was refrozen, three or four times over. YUCK!  I would only visit again if you twisted my arm and were a guest visiting and really, really had to go.  I will say that this place is super cheap and super budget friendly."}
{"text":"I was glad when this place opened because the other Steak 'N Shakes were either out in Lake County or are on the far west side of Cleveland--pretty far from my domicile in Little Italy!  Although this is primarily a hamburger joint, many of the other items on the menu are pretty darn good too. Surprisingly, the salads are awesome, especially the taco salad and fried chicken salad. Sure, they're not your healthy diet salads, but they had a *tad* bit more nutritional value than a good ole steakburger, right?  ...But if you're headin' to this place, you're probably not too concerned about that, right? I hope not, because if you are, you'll miss out on some great burgers and fries. Oh yeah, you'll miss out on shakes too--I don't really like shakes, but I do order them when I go here because they always offer a unique variety of flavors.  All in all, this is a solid addition to Steelyard Commons, and if you're looking for a quick meal down there, you'll be hard pressed to find somewhere better."}
{"text":"This place is a longtime favorite. My mom and I go there pretty frequently when I head across town to visit her. I was overjoyed when they put one up here and the quality has still remained strong even though it's been open for quite a while.  One thing I like a lot about this place is that several parts of the menu are very fluid--they are always introducing new shakes and beverages! I'm not much of a shake person, but for some reason I always get one here--maybe it's cause they're fat free yet still yummy?   Another nice thing about this place is that nearly every menu item is awesome. I've had all types of food here--patty melts, cheeseburgers, plain burgers, and the salads--and they're all worth ordering over and over again. It takes me a LONG time to figure out what to order here!  Plus, the prices are pretty reasonable, and if you use one of their frequently issued coupons, it's even lower!"}
{"text":"I stopped in (I don't normally eat fast food but I was craving a grilled cheese and a shake). I ordered two grilled cheese and a milkshake. When I got to the window the girl didn't greet me but just held her hand out for my payment. She literally said maybe two words to me and handed me my order like I  was inconveniencing her. I asked for my receipt and same reaction.  I calmly asked about the grilled cheese as I thought they were 2 for $3. She informed me they were not and made me feel stupid because I've came here twice in my life and didn't know. I told her she was having an attitude and that she lacked customer service because, well, she does. I can't believe they have her working the drive thru. She was rude and clearly does no care whatsoever. Maybe they'll learn."}
{"text":"Lucked out and only waited 5 mins for a table! Guacamole Burger & fries were great! Shake was tasty too! Enjoyed our experience. Food came out fast and hot!"}
{"text":"My friends are in LV for the CES and asked for suggestions on a new place to try.  I heard about this new restaurant chain opening up and offered it up as a recommendation.  So that was how we came to check out Steak 'n Shake, located in the South Point Hotel & Casino.  It is located near the escalator to the theater, or just ask a South Point employee for direction and keep an eye out for the long line of people waiting to be seated.  The wait to be seated was just about 30 minutes for lunch on a Friday, which was very good compared to the 1 hour wait I heard others having to put up with to try the food at SnS.  And our servers were great. Both were very professional, efficient, and friendly.  Since we have 5 in our party, we were able to ordered 5 different hamburgers and 2 hot dogs.  The Blue Cheese Bacon Burger - Good flavor, not that much blue cheese, a pretty good burger.  The Grilled Portobello n Swiss Burger - Patty was juicy, decent amount of mushrooms.   Guacamole Steakburger - Not that much guacamole, besides that the burger was good.  Spicy Chipotle Steakburger - Has a slight spicy kick, but nothing a non-wuss can't handled.    Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger - Probably my favorite burger that we ordered.  The onions was good and the beef patty was juicy and flavorful.    My only complaint is that the french fries that dominate the bulk of the plate real estate is just not that good.  It is cut smaller than the regular french fries, fairly crispy, but just don't feel like it is as good as other french fries (think McDonald's).  The hotdogs we tried was just okay at best.  The portions is just like the regular hot dogs you can buy in the grocery store, except you have the pick of different toppings.  Chicago-Style Steak Frank - nice combination of toppings. Would order again, if you have the option to not have to get the fries.  Coleslaw Steak Frank - Coleslaw was nothing special and there was just about 1 tbsp worth on the hot dog.  Worth the $4.99 price tag??? Definitely not, especially if you can get $0.75 hot dogs from South Point.  Milk Shakes - overall it was very good.  Good portion and taste.  I also don't like having to wait in line again to pay for your meal, especially after having to wait a long time to just get seated.  Overall, the food quality is like food at most fast food restaurants, except the time required to finally get your food disqualifies Steak 'n Shake from the fast food restaurants classification.  Food - 3/5 (1/5 for the fries).  Service - 4/5 Price/Value - 2.5/5 (if you can't get full on the burger, which is not all that big, there are plenty of petite cut french fries to fill your tummy) Location - 2.5/5  Unless you live near South Point, it will be a decent amount of drive time.  If you are a tourist without a car, it is definitely not worth the cab fare.  Overall 3/5 at best."}
{"text":"Since there was  no line  waiting time minimal but Disappointed hamburger came cold !!! Fries same cold and over cooked??? What is so special about this place?"}
{"text":"Sorriest excuse for a S&S that we've ever been in! Being that this is the only one in the state of Arizona,  you'd think they'd want to be a shining example, but I guess not. We came in about 2:30 for a couple of shakes. One couple was in there, and they were already eating,  so obviously they no longer needed to be helped. The only person besides us that was placing an order was a guy ordering a burger. We were given a pager. This was the first time in my life that I've been given a pager to wait on shakes. We went to a table and sat down to wait. And wait. And wait! I looked at my receipt, and it had now been 10 minutes since our order was placed. I looked over at the 3 employees on duty behind the counter, and none of them gave any hints that they were working on making them. My husband went up to inquire about why it was taking so long. The girl explained that they were just \"so busy\". My husband gestured around himself at all of the empty chairs and said, \"Yeah, I see how busy it is in here!\" At that point, they decided to make our shakes, probably to get us off of their case. Another thing I should mention is that it appeared that every table was dirty, as well as the seats, floors, and the condiment area. Overall, a super disappointing experience. Thank goodness we live in Florida where we can have our shakes within a minute or two after ordering."}
{"text":"1980/1981 - 2 starving transplants to the Midwest from Arizona discovered Steak N' Shake.  Sadly, one was a graduate student and the other a \"Purdue Wife\" living on a stipend.  We would save and splurge on a trip to Steak N'Shake where we would chow down on a burger each, a shake and large order of fries yo share.  We moved home yo Arizona but always missed the steak burgers and the amazing shoestring fries.  Then we heard that a Steak N'Shake had opened in Arizona!  OMG we were excited.  We planned a big date night out and got some burgers to start.  The steakburgers are as good as we remembered them as were the shakes.  The shoestrings were good but the portion so small we could no longer split an order but had to get one each.  It definitely took us back to our early married days in Indiana!"}
{"text":"Bomb hamburger n shakes kinda like a overpriced five guys but hey your in Vegas expect to pay alittle more for everything"}
{"text":"We love this place. The price is very reasonable for the whole family. The shakes are so good. Just wish they kept the Jr size shakes for the kids."}
{"text":"While the service was not very fast, the prices and food definitely makes up for that! This place has super great prices for the amount of food you get. Also, their menu is pretty extensive, so you most likely can satisfy anyone's craving. I definitely recommend the garlic burger if you're a fan of garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Came here several times because the food is amazing but service always sucks. This last time we waited in line to be seated for 10 minutes and then waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come take out order after she stopped by and said \"sorry y'all there's one more table ahead of y'all\". Uh... serving doesn't work like that, lady. Then waited another 30 minutes for the food to come out. Love Steak 'n Shake but the service is always shit!"}
{"text":"Well, was disappointed in our lunch on Sunday. Ordered the grilled chicken salad and had too remove the meat, chicken. I was not going to say anything hung but my wife did.  She told the waitress the chicken was removed as it taste different and \" rubbery\".   The waitress checked with the management and updated us that the grilled chicken comes to them \"precooked and frozen\" and they are to out on the grill and heat up before using on salads.   Never Again!'"}
{"text":"My second interaction with Steak 'n Shake. I ordered the Triple Steakburger with shoestring fries. I really hate shoestring fries and I wish they use steak fries instead.   After all they named their business Steak n' Shake. I ordered two Steakburger and shoestring fries with coffee. Coffee is $2.45 with free refills. This will make Steak 'n Shake my new coffee shop for that alone especially since Hooter's has free Wi-Fi. The two orders of Triple Steakburger is enough fill me up. I got a appetite like a velociraptor with attitude to match. I say Steak n' Shake is worth going to for breakfast, lunch and dinner anytime of the day. I am satisfied that they are in my favorite casino Hooter's."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try the burger and waited in line for about 40 minutes. Then nightmare started as our server didn't attend to us until 20 minutes after. We ordered 3 burgers and waited close to 40 minutes. I figured this cheap burger better be good after waiting that long!!! Finally our burgers came but lo and behold!!! We got a freaking cold burger!!! After that hellish experience, never again will we ever go to this place!!! Beware all ya'll!!!"}
{"text":"Patty melt with bacon was great!! Had it with fries & an orange freeze milkshake that was off the chain!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the food was absolutely disgusting.  My husband's double cheddar burger had a small dollop of cheese in the middle.  I didn't know cheese could \"dollop\".  Gross.  And I was able to literally see through the patty on my burger.    For some reason, they were made without the burger fixings..lettuce tomato etc. They literally brought us our patties and bread.  When we asked the server about it, she didn't even know anything was wrong. We had to pull out the menu and show her what was missing.   In a more positive note, the shakes were yummy."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you can get in I love there shakes. Burgers are ok but small good fries service is slow and kind of rude. For the money a good place but not worth a hr wait go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Fast food and a chain with long lines( not worth the wait).  I don't eat beef so can't comment on the burgers.  My wife had the chili and its a relative bargain at 3.45 for generous cup with onions and cheese.  My cousin had a grilled cheese.  Its inexpensive at 4.45, served with fries.  It was way too bready for my liking( its served on texas toast) and its also contains processed plasticy cheese.  My cousin ordered a nutella shake, it tasted just like nutella.    Not much else to say, if you've had steak and shake anywhere else, its exactly the same."}
{"text":"Nov 26, 2016 I love cheeseburgers, so when I travel I make sure to go to places that I don't have where I live. So I avoid McDonald's, Carl's Jr. Burger King. If you want a great cheeseburger try this place.  I had a great lunch here, I had the Original double cheese burger and fries. The food was hot and very tasty. The place was clean, the staff was nice and the price was very reasonable. It's fast and good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few days ago to eat with friends staying at the South Point, and let me say I'll never come back.   Got there at 7pm on a Tuesday and there was a line outside of it...uhm, ok. Wait in line and about 10 mins later we were seated. We asked for a bigger table since we had a large group, we waited for a larger table to clear up.   We were waiting for some time then our server came to take drink orders. She was nice, but it seemed like it was understaffed. I saw a few employees cleaning but not enough servers. Took a few minutes for our waters to come. Then we decided on what shakes and meals we wanted and ordered that. The shakes took a while too. When they came out they were huge and I was excited. I tasted mine (strawnilla) and it was ok, not great.   Then the burgers came. They were such sad burgers. I ordered the double burger with no lettuce and onion, and it came with lettuce. Ok, I'll live. Took a bite...disgusting. Dry. Didn't like it. Tried the fries, dry. Didn't like them. Ranch was watery.   I don't understand the hype around this place. I never need to come back. I think it's just a tourist trap. Save your time and money and go to in n out."}
{"text":"The place was very, very dirty. Floors were very slippery with grease. Old French fries under the booths and dirt. It looked like the floor hadn't been cleaned in years. The Restroom would gag a maggot. Dried Ketchup on the walls. Ordered the Prime burger and it took 30 minutes to receive. The waitress told me after it came that it takes 30 minutes to cook! I did receive a phone call from the manager and we had a frank discussion. He promised me they were going to clean up. I will do a follow up soon to see if there are any changes."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today with my husband and toddler. We originally went to Mellow Mushroom but their service sucked so we went here instead. The place was very clean, the guy behind the counter was extremely nice and made us feel welcome. He had great customer service and greeted with a smile, everything, he was outstanding :)  The reason for the 4 stars is because the fries, although delicious, looked nothing like in the picture. I also ordered the super cheesy hamburger, my husband ordered the steak one and I ordered the hot dog for my son. I was helping my son eat the hot dog and my selfish husband already is down to his last bites of the hamburger when I realized... he is eating my freakin hamburger! I yell at him and he says he will eat half of his, give me the other half and I eat the remainder of my hamburger which was about three bites. That didn't happen.. because my idiot, human vacuum as a husband, seemingly swallowed the daggone hamburger whole, I was only left eating the three bites of my original hamburger and the fries. so.. I basically just ate fries at this place. The three bites I did have were amazing and I am going by myself next time."}
{"text":"Like all the best things in life, this place is both cheap and good.   I've had Steak n Shake bookmarked since the day they opened in town, but haven't had a chance to try it until today. I have to admit, I'm glad I waited after hearing about the monstrously long lines.   We arrived around 7:15 and were seated by 7:25, so not too long a wait. My jaw dropped when I opened the menu to see the cheapest prices for a casino burger I've seen in AGES! The prices alone made me love this place.  I decided on the guacamole burger with a very berry strawberry milkshake. My fella got the royale with the cookies n cream milkshake. My dining partners Ryan B. got the western burger with the cookie dough milkshake and Carolyn S. got the trip of shooters with a turtle nut caramel shake. We all absolutely loved and devoured our burgers and shakes. There was a 50/50 split (boys vs. girls) on the fries, with girls in favor of them and the boys against. My fella was swayed over to the girls side after he sprinkled some of the spices on, liberally of course.   Oh, and the shakes. The shakes are heaven in a glass. I highly recommend the specialty shakes, especially the fruit options since they have real fruit blended in there, but they were all equally delicious. You can't go wrong here.  A special shout out to the pepper sauce. I mixed some in with my ketchup for an extra zing.   Special note: The service was good at first, but once we ordered it was a little difficult to get a hold of our waitress to get refills and more ketchup, but she came back and redeemed herself with lots of refills and plenty of ketchup.  I'm officially a fan and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent food but seems like it takes awhile to go though the drive through even with small orders shakes and tenders are good that my go too if I eat here"}
{"text":"This is pretty hilarious, my bf bought this back to the hotel so I can try when he went to south point casino. I had low expectation lol, but the burger was very decent. Juicy and fluffy?? I don't know, I might have been very hungry...but I enjoyed it very much. The fries was hard though."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this place for awhile.  It seems like a combination of a 1950s diner and a fast food joint.  Maybe Johnny Rockets would be a good comparison.  Anyways, we go to South Point quite often when we're in Vegas, and when Steak 'n Shake opened up here a few years back...I knew that I had to try it.  Problem was that the line was always so long no matter what time of the day or night that we passed by.  Finally, got the opportunity to give them a taste two months ago.  While our friends were gambling, wifey and I decided to have a snack here.  We shared the double cheeseburger combo from their Under $4 menu.  I just checked their website, and the menu is still available.  The double cheeseburger was pretty good.  I would not consider it the freshest and tastiest burger.  It is definitely not a gourmet burger, but it is better than most fast food places (with the exception of In N Out).  The french fries that came with the combo were above average.  I'd have to give the double cheeseburger combo 3 stars.    On the other hand, the milkshakes are terrific.  My wife ordered  the Strawberry Banana Shake, and I had the Ultimate Banana Shake.  Wow!  Those two were delicious!  I'd have to say they were one of the best milk shakes that I have ever had.  Okay, I admit that I do not order milkshakes too often.  My wife is more the expert, and she said that she would put them in her top 5.  We both agreed the shakes were worth 5 stars all by themselves.  Paid a total of $16.93  for two shakes and a double cheeseburger combo plus tip.  So, I'd say that the prices are fair. Service was okay, fast, and efficient.  If you do not want to stand in the long waiting line outside in the casino area, then I did notice that they have a section where you could place take out orders. I would get a shake to go and drink it while playing.  Wish they would offer us complimentary milkshakes from Steak 'n Shake while gambling.  I would gamble more here for sure!  Here are my ratings for Steak 'n Shake:  Double Cheeseburger is 3 stars Strawberry Banana Shake is 5 stars Ultimate Banana Shake is 5 stars Ambiance is 4 stars Service is 3.5 stars  Overall a solid 4 star rating  I would come back to have their milk shakes.  Probably not for the burgers though, unless there is not a long line again the next time we're at South Point."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Steak 'n Shake when I moved to St Louis more than 40 years ago. When looking for lunch here in Pittsburgh, I saw Steak 'n Steak and suddenly had a desire to try their chili 5 ways again.  The Chili 5 Ways tasted as I remembered it but it was lukewarm and had to be reheated. When it was reheated, it was perfect - cheesy and with loads of that chili flavor. Satisfying, comfort food.   My waitress was friendly and attentive. I was served quickly. The store seemed clean and was bright with the early spring sun.   Visiting this restaurant was pure nostalgia. I won't need to do this again anytime soon. I'm sure the chocolate coke spiked my sugar and I don't ever need to do this again."}
{"text":"Eek!  Steak 'n Shake, famous in such places as... Ohio... has made it to Mill Avenue.  My daughter, after a particularly amazing play date, was really exhausted when she leaned against the car window and saw this place out of the corner of her eye.  \"Shakes, Mom?\" More a demand than a question, but hey.    Anyway, I caved in easily and we parked and made our way inside.  There was a line of about five people in front of us.    She ordered a kids' meal with a Mint shake and I ordered whatever their special was.    This fast food joint has NOT found its groove yet.  After waiting more than twenty minutes after ordering, we were buzzed to the counter to get her shake.  More than forty minutes after ordering, we were called up to get our food.  When I looked in the bag, I noticed her grilled cheese sandwich looked a lot like a plain hamburger.  Perhaps fine for other kiddos, but not for my beef-hating child.    I brought it back up to the counter and she told me she would remake it.  I asked how long it would be and she said \"on the fly,\" whatever that means.  2 stars for that gal.    So we waited another ten minutes and an employee (perhaps a manager) was walking by to ask how we were liking everything.  I told him we did not get our sandwich yet because it was made incorrectly.  He immediately went up and checked on it.  We got our sandwich two minutes later.  5 stars for this guy.    1.) It took too long.  1 star. 2.) The kid was full by the time her food arrived because she had consumed her entire shake during the wait (which was good because it would have melted otherwise).  5 stars for the mint shake, according to kiddo. 3.) There was a minor price difference of maybe 10 or 20 cents in the restaurant's favor.  You'd think that the restaurant would have at least OFFERED to give it back to us.  I wouldn't have refused it.  My kiddo does have a piggy bank, after all. 4.) Did I mention it too way too long? 1 star.  We won't be back to this location until they smooth out their kinks... even though their parmesan herb fries were delish."}
{"text":"Drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout. Food is always served hot- inside it just takes a lot longer than it should, both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come. Also, the lids on the milkshake cups are awful and fall off easily. Make sure to hold on tight!"}
{"text":"First ate at Steak and Shake in New York by the David Letterman Theater when it was raining so hard we needed some shelter so we ran inside and then decided to grab a bite.   This location on Mill Ave by ASU is nice and clean and after you order the give you a pager to let you know your order is ready.   I ordered the Royal which has bacon and egg along with fries and of course a oreo shake.  The burger is pretty good for fast food and the fries are shoestring style. Both are above average and very good for fast food.  The shake was not as cold as I expected but was pretty good.  The order came out within 5 minutes and we ended up having it to go.  Great location and for the money the food is well prepared.   When I come back to ASU I will certainly keep this place in mind to come back to."}
{"text":"They screwed up my order at 4:50am on multiple accounts. Cheeseless cheeseburgers, fudgeless fudge shakes and cold fries. Not cool."}
{"text":"Finally a Steak 'n Shake in Arizona! Love this place! It's a modern version of the classic Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"I'll never get those who don't think that Steak and Shake burgers rock.  Thin patties of fresh beef with a great sear on them stacked up with fresh toppings and served on a soft, toasted bun. I love the things and the prices are decent.  Throw in a cherry coke and I am a happy guy.  Here's a hint for anyone going to any Steak and Shake...  It's STEAK and Shake.  Don't go and order a chicken sandwich or something other than burgers.  I've only ever sat at the bar at this location but the service has always been on point and the restaurant looks clean.  That plus the burgers means they will see me again."}
{"text":"The Steak and Shake is really named steakburger I believe and they are quite a machine. I came in sat down was ordered and so promptly did my food come back I'm going wow are they psychic that they know what I ordered and started it before I even got there? Well anyway it was an okay Hamburger Fries were nice warm beautiful the strawberry shake was excellent the service was very very good and the hamburger was well average. but all in all when you look at a place inside the casino with everything the price it is very inexpensive the people are very nice and you can get back on with whatever else you were doing real promptly. What I come back well there are nine other restaurants to choose from I think I'll shop around a little bit. The casino is big and there are a lot of choices. I love exercising my ability to choose."}
{"text":"This is the only Steak 'N Shake I've ever been to, so I don't really know how to compare it to others.  I have never observed any heinous uncleanlinesses, despite the fact that the decor is primarily white and is lit by the most migraine-inducing possible flourescent lights.  So, it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for being well kempt and having a waitstaff that is WAY more patient with late night hysterical student milkshake procurement than I could ever have imagined possible, but loses that third star because said milkshakes, once procured, taste like they have had 10 pumps of sugar syrup injected in and the frenchfries I ordered to go with said milkshakes tasted like they had been fried in grease that was maybe 36 hours past due to be replaced from the ol' fryer."}
{"text":"I was here with a bunch of friends for dinner after watching a movie at the waterfront. Few of them are huge fans of this food joint and I decided to give it a try.   Out waiter was very helpful and cheerful person. We ordered milkshakes, fries, burgers, chicken tenders, one item with beans and pork. No complaints about the food. It was good and well prepared! Of course the milkshakes are good, also heavy!!   Everything was going well until I noticed a ball of hair beside my table which freaked me out. It kind of ruined my experience and effected the first impression I have on this place."}
{"text":"Steak n Shake was not a very pleasant experience for me! After being almost deceived by its homely appearance, I quickly noticed the understaffed, too tired employees. In fact, the waitress even said that the \"chef never came in\" and the \"milkshake guy just walked out\" during a busy busy time (post July 4 celebrations).  All I wanted was to enjoy a nice cheap chili cheese dog with salt and vinegar fries, but it took the waitress 30 minutes to get to us, and another 30 minutes for her to bring us her food.  In fact,  I'm pretty sure the waitress was cooking our food. My friend ordered a salad - the apple harvest chicken salad - while we were waiting for our food, we heard a nervous exclamation from the kitchen - \"how do you make a salad?\"  All in all, the food was mediocre. The hot dog seemed like it was frozen and prepackaged. My other friends chicken tenders looked wimpy and reheated. However, apparently the salad was actually pretty good. Not good enough to redeem the wait though.   If you're going to come here, just go through the drive-thru. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see that Steak n Shake was opening near us. It's one of our families favorites! Unfortunately, we are very unhappy with our first visit. We made a stop around 5 , through the empty drive thru. We waited 15 minutes or so for poorly wrapped burgers. They were all labeled incorrectly. We unwrapped our burgers to find that all 3 of the burgers we ordered were missing something. The buns were soaking full of oil, that's all we could taste the first few bites !  The buns fell apart and we couldn't even eat our meal. We are extremely disappointed... one of our favorite spots and  we will not be returning to this location !   The south point location however; is amazing ! We will keep going to that one and we highly recommend  going to that location instead! Never messed up a meal, always quick and kind."}
{"text":"I just didn't really liked their hamburgers the meat it was as thin as a tortilla ?, our check came to the table without even asking for it as if they were in a rush of kicking us out waiter came like 3-4 time to ask if we wanted something else yet so he brought the check , fries  where good but not really wort the price , the rushing, the crowd , can't even  a recommend this place , sad because every body says is good, but not for me or my family."}
{"text":"Slow ...as.....heck!!!!. And how can you mess up a rootbeer float? Wait, I know... YOU LEAVE OUT THE ICE CREAM!!  YUP....rootbeer and whipped cream.  Ugh!  Seriously??"}
{"text":"Well the only thing I like is their shakes , their shakes are awesome and amazing don't order burgers anymore just get the shakes"}
{"text":"I seem to get the same server by chance and she's my favorite! Great good at a great price! Chocolate covered strawberry milk shake...nuff' said"}
{"text":"Always reliable college-town type food I can get for cheap at any hour of the day. There's not much else to say about the restaurant as it's pretty standard diner fare at standard diner prices with standard quality. The only things that are slightly special are the better than normal milkshakes and special chili sauce."}
{"text":"No drive through and their entrances are closed off... have to go through hotel to get in ... lady at counter didn't know what the garlic glaze on the bun was"}
