{"text":"The pho was actually quite tasty until I found a floating surprise...with legs! After spotting the dead insect I lost my appetite. The waiter was very pleasant and gave us great service. I just didn't like the extra added ingredient."}
{"text":"My first time there with the family two weeks ago. There were five of us in one small table next to the restroom. We waited for an hour and only ice water came out. Seriously, how long does it take for the cook to make 5 bowls of pho??? The worse part was that the waiter didn't even try to come by and let us know that they're way behind. Unacceptable! I will tell all of my friends and other family member not to come to this place. We went to Kim Long and the wait were well worth it!"}
{"text":"5 Star Vietnamese food in Vegas! The owners are from OC, Cali... Everything here is very authentic and flavorful. All the rice dishes are great. The Pho has great broth and generous portions.

Best of all, all of the employees are very knowledgable and personable. They make it a point to help you understand how each dish should be used in condiments and they make it a point to be friendly and get to know you. Most asks places aren't very personable.

Great ownership and great food!"}
{"text":"They can't do substitutions, not a big fan of pork and their spring rolls have chicken/pork in them, not real chicken. Even though I didn't eat it, I still had to pay for it. They also can't make fried rice. If it's not on the menu, they can't do it."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is even better!!! I will be back as soon I'm back in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good until my friend was trying to change table to a booth . long story but short The waiter said they going to \"CHARGE\" us extra . WTF? This ain't no 5 Stars Fine Dining! You got me fucked up.."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before coming here and was greatly disappointed. It is pricier than most pho restaurants. Menu was limited to different variations of pho, vermicelli noodle dish, and rice dish. We ordered one of the pho bowls with the orange broth and a vermicelli dish. Both dishes were just okay. Not a big fan of the orange broth or noodles. Again, very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the nem neung spring rolls and the bun bo hue. The bowl of bun bi hue had sooo much flavorful and came with lot of different kind of meats. They don't skimp on anything. And the nem neung had a very crunchy aspect to the spring roll that made it delicious. The dipping sauce was lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Great soup. Excellent service.
Did I mention Great Soup!
Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Ive eaten here a lot before but after my last visit. I felt the need to let people know how great they are. Especially the gentleman who was helping me name Mo . So i was on a bit of a time crunch so i decided to call ahead for a togo order . Was inform it would be ready in 15-20 just enough time for it to be ready when i arrive. But unfortunately when i came. The order got mix up and wasnt put in. As i stood waiting . Mo must have realize how much of a rush i was in. So he very professionally came to me. Said he would take care of my meal and continues to apologize for the mix up.....now that is what i call customer service. Especially for a vietnamese resturant where most ive been to ,the service have been lack lust at best . To think about it. This was not the first time ive recieve such amazing service here. I order for take out a lot. And sometime i would order for others as well. Come to think of it. Everytime when i have a lot to carry to the car. Mo would gladly even during busy hour. Help me take my food out to the car. I can see why he is so close to a lot of the customers that comes through. Overall the staff here is wonderful whether you are dinning in. Or just taking out. They treat you the way you should. And they would be recieving my business for many and more visits. The food is amazing . And its the only place i would go to get my com tam fix. Portion is great for the price. And above all the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. Pho is really good. The Pho's aroma is so awesome, this is what traditional Pho is all about. Best Pho in Vegas. But on the side note. Don't drink the ice water. Have an extra taste to it :(. Guessed you win some, you lose some. Plus, the service is OK.  Otherwise, the Pho is awesome. Will come back for just for the Pho."}
{"text":"The food was decent but they charged 15% service fee for 5+ people. 15-20% is customary tip for good service but these people just brought us food and never even checked in on us! They even had self-serve fish sauce! DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Visit:  late afternoon, Saturday, Oct. 31, 2015
 
Although located off of the always bustling Spring Mountain Rd., Pho Bosa is on the cusp of what is deemed as China Town, in a section that feels more industrial than most typical restaurant goers might be accustomed to when looking for a place to dine -- but don't let that stop you from venturing into this little hole-in-the wall gem!

Inside is small and utilitarian; with just a handful of booths and a few tables -- each table having a variety of sauces to spice things up.  The wait staff is prompt, friendly, and also quite helpful. 

* Important Note:  The men's and women's restrooms are located outside of the establishment itself, in a hallway immediately outside of the back exit. -- I admit, at night it can be a bit spooky. So, if you're a big wuss like me...have a friend tag along! 

My friend and I both ordered vermicelli bowls -- one a combination of grilled pork, shrimp cake, fried rolls, and a side order of grilled shrimp -- the other bowl had chicken and short ribs.  And for starters, an order of Fresh Spring Rolls.

In all fairness and truth, let me just say, I've never met a vermicelli bowl that I didn't like! :) 

And, Pho Bosa did not disappoint! The bowls are large, the salad crisp, and all of the meats were flavorful and grilled to perfection.  Also, the shrimp cake is quite fantastic -- beautiful color, taste, and texture; a nice add-on to any meal.

Spring Rolls: They're okay. I can't say that they're particularly special, they don't have much going on in terms of flavor -- but I will say that I do enjoy the crunchy texture that the fried wrapper adds. 

I'll Be Back!!! :)"}
{"text":"First time here with my oldest and hubby... Very quiet, small, and great pho soup.. I ordered meatball brisket pho! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Came in here with friends after some drinks next door. We ordered noodle soup and some grilled pork chops. Our table was stunned silent based on how good everything came out of the little kitchen. Great little place. Will be back again."}
{"text":"First time having Vietnamese....... OH MY GOSH... To die for.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful and explained everything on the menu to me, I had the broken rice with Korean short ribs, egg rolls & egg combination as well as the sausage spring rolls AND a fresh coconut. WOW"}
{"text":"Place looks like a hole in the wall. Food was average and nothing special. Ordered a #70, typical viet pho noodle soup. Found a piece of hair hanging out on top of my omosa. The hostess was openly coughing everywhere, didn't bother to try and cover her mouth. Will never come back ever again."}
{"text":"We went to get a bowl of bun bo hue on our weekend in Vegas. On Saturday, they posted a sign saying that they ran out of food. On Sunday, after a 30 minute wait, we were seated only to find that they didn't have the bun bo hue available. The venue lacked air condition and we had a fly that pestered our table. Our server dropped off the food and then never made it back to our table... I normally don't leave reviews but this experience warranted a review."}
{"text":"Coming from Orange County in California where ph shops are a competitive business, this place just doesn't stack up. The pho was actually not too bad, maybe 4/5 stars because the smell and taste was too bold and the price is above average. 

But man, the service here is TERRIBLE. My party of 8 arrived at around 1:30pm and we told them it was ok to split us to separate tables of 4 ppl if it would be more convenient. So my party got split, but that doesn't change the fact that it still took half an hour to get our food even though we ordered right away. It should not take more than 10min to bring out a bowl of pho. We were never checked on again. And after all that they STILL charged our two SEPERATE tables the 15% gratuity, even though we weren't even seated near each other or at the same time. 

Tl;dr Don't come here unless you have a small group of people with hours to kill. The food might be worth the money, but the experience is not."}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed with this restaurant! After reading some good reviews about this place, I decided to take my family for some Pho cause I was really craving for it. As we were getting ready to order...the waitress notified us that they had no pho at the moment. How can they not have any pho...when they specialize in \"Pho\" and isn't that why their name is \"Pho Bosa\"? If the waitress would have told us as soon as we walked in, we could have gone else where for some pho. On top of that, the food that were ordered where not all that great. The only reason why I gave this store a 3 is because the staffs were very friendly! I don't think I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Broth is DELICIOUS!! And they give soooo much meat! (Got the combination beef pho) tuge definately revived me after last night lol"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue and Bun Rieu are my favorites here, and might be the best in town.

Restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood. It is dimly lit with fluorescent lighting (not cool diner vibe, just makes your eyes tired vibe), there's really no decor, and the springs in the booth chairs are pretty much gone so you sink really low when you sit. The restrooms are not in the restaurant, so you'd have to go outside of the restaurant to use the restroom.

Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I love the employees here. They're always greet me with a big smile and very helpful with the menu. Foods are also great. I love the pork spring roll"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse Vietnamese place I've ever been at. The pho is acceptable. The pork chop is frozen dried jerky that is over brined and salted. The pork spring roll is not freshly made."}
{"text":"I had the pho tai here while staying in vegas.  Pho bowl was kind of pricey at $8.50.  The business is located in a office building complex.  Bathrooms are outside.  The pho was excellent....good broth and the noodles were nice and firm.  Service was okay given how busy they were."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese food!  I go here every time I visit Las Vegas and it is always superb.  The noodles like bun Bo hue are terrific and very unique, the rice dishes always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Do not let the location throw you off. Excellent service, authentic & super tasty food! Best pho place I've been to."}
{"text":"I ordered veggie pho, no tofu. This is a personal preference, to me the broth was too salty and buttery. Also, the only veggies they put in the pho were broccoli and cabbage. The service was nice."}
{"text":"I always go here when I have a craving for bun bo hue or bun rieu. Their bun bo hue and bun rieu is the best in Vegas! 

I really can't say enough about their service! They are very professional and nice. They were very accurate about how long my food would take, they texted me to let me know when my food was ready for pick up, helped me to bring it to my car, and when I called to let them know that they forgot 2 of the soups (I had a VERY big order and I didn't noticed until I got home), they went way out of their way and personally delivered it right away (and it's a 30 mins drive)! Wish they were closer so I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I'm back because it is so delicious. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and tasty. Shrimp cakes with fish sauce and broken rice is awesome. It was something I didn't expect to like but thanks to a friend's introduction - I am hooked! The pho is also just as great. Eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There are two reasons why I moved to Las Vegas.  Reason number one was career move.  Reason number two was to be close to Bun Bo Hue, Ta Hu Ky and Short Ribs with broken rice and all the mind blowing food this restaurant offers.  The ribs are savory, tender, and exploding with flavor.  I've eaten at Vietnamese restaurants for over 22 years from coast to coast to the dirty south.  Bosa 1 is top notch.  The staff is friendly.  Mo, Vanessa, Mimi, and Kevin are the reallest $(@\"&$ out there who are very passionate about the quality of their culinary creations and service.  Writing about it is making me hungry.  Peace"}
{"text":"I ate here today and it was fantastic!! very well priced! 
I have eaten Pho's in Vietnam, Australia and America, and this small restaurant was spot on. A good quality broth with some really traditional ingredients.
Another good sign is when there are a lot of Vietnamese customers, and this place had plenty.

if you want something in Vegas healthier than what the strip has to offer, this is the place to go! will go again next time iM in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and it was closed due to no electricity...
Came back today. Overall price is high and the food quality is low. It is not clean.
1. Food quality - 1*. I ordered shrimp eggroll. The shrimp vein was not removed. As far as I considered,  this is equivalent to shrimp shit (see photos). Not acceptable. The shrimp cake inside color was not oink. It means that it was mixed with lot of fish paste. It lacked the firmness of real shrimp cake (see photos). There was almost no meat in the meat loaf (see photo).
There was no \"thinh\" in the porkskin/shreddedpork. This is not acceptable.
2. Cleanlines - 1*. The 2 out of 3 servers worn disposable kitchen aprons. They also worked in the kitchen. The aprons were dirty and they kept wearing them (see photo). 
3. Price is high - 1*. I ended up paying 24 dollars for side if meatbsll, 2 pieces of eggroll and a rice dish. 
4. Pho broth was terrible. From the smell, it stinks of beef bones instead flavor full from the brisket. It means that they substitute meat for stinking bones. 

They charged everything that is supposed to be free in an authentic Pho restaurant such as sliced onion or a small amount of extra soup.

I definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"Well done. Nothing like a bowl of nectar to return you to a functional state after 3days in Vegas! Very pleasant and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian pho, I've ever had. The broth was flavorful enough that I almost wondered if it wasn't vegetarian. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When we go out for pho I never go with expectations that I'm going to a fine dining restaurant. I am looking for good food and cleanliness, not atmosphere. That being said Pho Bosa met my expectations. The broth was good (better than Pho Kim Long), and the egg rolls were better than most. The restaurant is very small and you need to go outside to find the restrooms."}
{"text":"Very good food and very nice and friendly owner. We had brisket and beef ball pho which tasted yummy, very tasty broth. My husband love the pork sausage spring rolls. He thought it was easily the best of all spring rolls he ever had !"}
{"text":"So far for me, the best pho in town. Bùn b Hu is very good. Good service. I see people complaining about being rushed out...I don't see it. Overall I would highly recommend this place if you like pho and bun bo hue."}
{"text":"After 48 hours nonstop drinking and the fear of a collective hangover if we stopped drinking led us to search for Pho and it's healing properties. We were really, REALLY surprised Pho was available especially in Las Vegas and we thought that even though we found Pho, it might just be some generic bowl of broth and noodles, but BOY where we proven wrong! 

For our appetizer we got an order of egg rolls (crunch and delicious!). My friend got a bowl of Pho Ga and she just couldn't stop raving about it and as for me I got bowl of beef Pho (slices of brisket and meatballs) which was also delicious.

We're not new the Pho scene (we live by Argyle & Broadway in Chicago; basically Vietnamese town) so we know what we're talking about! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Just AMAZING!!! 1st time eating Pho and it was awesome. Great service great food. Highly recommed anybody in the vegas area to check ot out!!!"}
{"text":"Im from bolsa california and i tried the food here. Theres too much MSG in the Pho and the springrolls were microwaved. Food was very poor in taste and quality"}
{"text":"PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS RIPPED OFF PHO BOSA RESTAURANT - They charged you 15% for what they called 'Service Charge' for 5 people or more.  It's fine for the 15% or even 18% like most American restaurants (Lucille's BBQ, Olive Garden, etc.) would charge.  But, the owner of this restaurant didn't get it through his head the BIG difference between those 15% American restaurants' service charge vs. the culturally basic Vietnamese restaurants' service charge.

We had to wait another additional 30 mins after we ordered our food.  After they brought out our food n drinks, they NEVER came by to ask or check on us.  They never came by n refilled our waters.  That was it, they delivered everything to our table ONCE.  After that they charged us (without any warning or notification) the 15% on our bill n until we asked, that was when they mentioned about their ripped-off n unethical 'Service Charge'.

We will NEVER come back here again.  They give most Vietnamese restaurants the BAD names.  SHAME ON YOU PHO BOSA !!!"}
{"text":"I went there couple weeks ago with friends.  I have Bun Bo Hue.  They have delicious food.  Servers are nice and friendly.  They are fast too.  Every time we ask them for something, they get it right a way.  I definitely will come back again :))"}
{"text":"Their pho is one of the best that I ever had! I have tried so many in Las Vegas but this one is excellent! Owners are very nice"}
{"text":"Reasonable price and tasty food. Pho noodles and rice is highly recommended! Will definitely revisit next time!"}
{"text":"It doesn't even deserved a star. Worst place ever. The pho is small. They have hidden charges, they try to rip us off by charging 12 bowls when we order 10 bowls. They also charge us for ice, 20% hidden service fee. They didn't change menu, so the food we order actually cost more. Don't eat here. Worst place and a cheating lair place. Rip off.."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am not a Pho person...but my friends wanted to go. Decided to have the bun reiu and let me tell you, the tastiest pho I've ever had!!! Must get. Also our server hi, was super nice, he had many stories to tell us and really helped us feel at home. 

Will probably come back here next time I'm in Vegas!! Yum!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating at this place after seeing all the reviews on Yelp. We found the place which is a few minutes off the strip in a shopping plaza. Place was pretty simple, we wanted to eat fresh spring rolls which you can find at any Vietnamese restaurant but they didn't have those, they had their own version of a spring roll which was OK, but there's no reason why they can't offer regular spring rolls. Anyways, we ordered pho and it arrived after about 10-15 minutes, and honesty, it was just OK. After reading the reviews, we expected much better. I've had better pho in Boston, Orlando and New York.  Our server was kind, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, pork spring rolls and fried pork egg rolls. I've visited Pho Bosa four times and it was delicious every time. Quality that rivals shops in San Gabriel and Westminster!

Their regular beef pho broth is heavier on the cinnamon side. I recommend sticking to bun bo hue or bun rieu which is what they specialize in."}
{"text":"Really liked there combo. This restaurant was hard to find good luck finding it but, if u find place u won't b disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh, so good! Excellent, really really good. Sunday night dinner out. Cold night, warm soup and green tea. Perfect remedy for December."}
{"text":"Very hard to find and looks very odd from the outside or whether or not the restaurant is open, but seriously worth the find.   Amazingly good food especially the broken rice plate.  Better than the other three restaurants that we ate in Vegas and was great.  This place was even better.   Comparable to one of the other top broken rice restaurant that we ate in San Jose.  Pho was also better than the other two top Pho restaurants we ate in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very small place with about 10 tables.Pretty good pho and bun bo hue. Service is just ok."}
{"text":"#1 BUN BO HUE (HUE SPICY BEEF SOUP NODDLE) in town. Die for that. So delicious! And the very best Combo broken rice plate. Don't miss Pork sausage roll for starter! Yum yum"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with the food and the service that I have to give this 5 stars. You may not think from the outside and the inside of the restaurant that this place is a quality restaurant. It looks a little dated, but you begin to notice the locals who patronize the Resturaunt. One of the wonderful aspects that the server explains the menu and based on your level of comfort will recommend dishes. I would highly recommend you try it and embrace the culture!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. We are always skeptical of new places but we decided to take a chance on this place. We decided that despite the mixed reviews it was worth a shot. After all not everyone's experiences are the same. We, for example, really enjoyed it. The Pho was good and had a really good flavor. We had spring rolls and egg rolls and both were really good. We were really pleased with the service and even more so with the check. We had a really pleasant visit. The service could use some improvement but not enough to complain about it. The location is a bit interesting but don't let it fool you, they have good food."}
{"text":"We knew and loved them as Bosa One and are just as thrilled with their food and kind service at Pho Bosa!!!  We didn't have any place to go in Las Vegas for good Vietnamese food when they were moving.  We're so glad your back!!!!  Our family favorites are the egg rolls, both regular and vegetarian, and the rice/noodle dishes!  The beef is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'd rather eat here than any buffet in vegas. I ordered bun bo hue and it was probably one of the best ive had.    Great food, great customer service."}
{"text":"Best broken rice dishes in town.  Good nem nuong as well, and finally found a good bowl of bun bo hue in vegas, my new favorite viet place here."}
{"text":"This place is mind blowing, best grilled pork I've ever had. Egg rolls are up there as well. The pork was cooked perfect and not covered in fat and grissel like other places. They also give you a huge amount of meat so you can have a piece with every bite."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've ever had. The customer service was amazing. The staff was extremely knowledgable and more then willing to explain anything. Try the hot lavender tea or the homemade hot soy milk you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First of all, we walked to this place all the way from Caesers in 85 degree weather just to try this place and it was worth it. 1.5 mile walk going both ways maybe even further.

We got the pork sausage rolls, number 70 abs number 78. All three choices were good. Number 70 is your traditional pho bowl with all the meats and 78 was a seafood pho which was also good. The soup was excellent,  not too salty and very tasty. The noodles were in good proportion as well as the meat. Definitely get the pork sausage rolls though.  The sauce they make for is tops it off!

The good thing about this place is that it was cheaper than the strip and it's also better than most food on there. It was also very clean inside. Even though it's small it wasn't crowded. The staff was very friendly and they even refill your water before your done. We gave them a generous tip just because this place was way better than service you'll find any where else near by."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, but haven't left a review yet. The staff is friendly and their pho never disappoints. Pho Ga is usually my first pick. Their egg rolls (chicken or pork) are so crispy & flavorful. And the Vietnamese coffee (iced or hot) is good. They're coming out with new desserts one of which we got to sample tonight, which was their tiramisu and it was delicious! Definitely ordering that on our next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food!!!!! I can't believe it has 4 stars! Chicken didn't look or taste like chicken, not sure what it was. Vegetarian pho smelled like beef. I would never go back even if they paid me to eat it."}
{"text":"It takes forever for food to come. Food is not that good.  Wouldn't recommend and won't come back."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food. I recommend Gi cun nem nng, Bún riêu, and Bún bò Hu. Bún riêu is of Southern style."}
{"text":"I dont get all the hype about this place, the food was good about a C+ nothing worth the fight to find a parking place!"}
{"text":"I love the rice there, me and my two older brother love going there like every week, the people that work there is REAL and so is the FOOD worth the price and money, and thats why i tried to be there everyweek. Everytime i eat anywhere els i feel the regret not getting the rice dish there instead.  Everytime i finish the Rice dish there i will always wrap my belt around my shoulder and say compliment to the CHIEF."}
{"text":"First time having PHO . It was very very good . We came at a perfect time.  The owner was very nice.  The food was PHO TASTIC. I recommend you coming here."}
{"text":"Pho was below average, bun bo hue great, and the rice dish that I ordered, the com suon nuong, was excellent!  Thai tea didn't really have a lot of flavor so I was disappointed. Also, the egg rolls were really bland.  I wish their fish sauce, the nuoc mam, had more flavor to it, add a little spice, some garlic, and green onions and it'll taste a lot better. 

The service was great!"}
{"text":"What a great Sunday lunch! On our way through on i15 and it was very convenient off the freeway. The pho and bun were both amazing. Not even going to bother finding other vietnamese places when we are back in town the next few months. Make sure you grab a thai iced tea as well."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa is Amazing!  Fam and I were looking for something different and this was perfection.  First off we are vegan/vegetarian so we had quite a few questions about their menu. Service was excellent!  Our waiter, Moses was very knowledgeable and very accommodating. He thought of everything!  

The food was just as good if not better! Super fresh and fortifying! Simply Delicious!"}
{"text":"Their bun rieu is delicious! Even on a warm Vegas day! Service is also great - very friendly and attentive. The wide variety of food keeps me coming back for more. Also must try the nem nuong. Their dipping sauce is so good! Clean Vietnamese restaurant with good authentic food and great service. A mandatory stop when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best bun bo hue in town. Super spicy and super delicious.

It's not for the faint of heart.

On top of that you get great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Being from the L.A. area, I felt the food wasn't as fresh, and the serving sizes were smaller than I'm used to.  I could overlook the location and decor for exceptional food, but it did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Very good food & the best iced coffee ever! It's at a convenient location too. I remember it was about 10 - 15 minutes away from Rio hotel. We are pleased with the food & service."}
{"text":"A must visit spot anytime I'm in Vegas now.

Best dish...hands down the sausage rolls. I've only had them in Southern California and was so glad to find them here. I only wish I could find a place in Northern California that served these as well.

Pho is legit.
Portions are good.
Price is right."}
{"text":"My sister lives in northern Washington, and has been carving good pho since the last time she came to Las Vegas.  We decided to give this place a shot, and it didn't disappoint.  She got the crab pho, I went with the usual beef everything.  Got an order of their pork spring rolls as well.  Everything was excellent.  The food came out fast, the guy working the front counter/waiting did an excellent job, keeping us topped up on drinks and just providing extremely friendly service.  He even gave us some samples of their \"world's best coffee\", both of which my sister drank and pronounced as pretty good.

I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Not the best location and the decor is poor, but the food was great.  I had the broken rice plate with beef, shrimp cake and quiche.  The shrimp cake was perfectly done."}
{"text":"Had the Bun Rieu ... and the Tau Hu Ky with pork chops. Excellent broken rice. Fresh and yummy. Large portions. Be ready to eat. Y'all."}
{"text":"First off, service is terrible here. Didn't get to order until 10 minutes and the servers don't even bother to make eye contact with you. We finally ordered and the table behind us got their food before mines and they came way after me. I had to leave after waiting 30 minutes and the appetizers weren't even served yet. There's better choice and price for vietnamese food like Kim Do couple blocks away. The prices there is cheaper than this place and bigger.

$7.95 for pho dac biet at Kim Do instead of $8.50 at Pho Bosa. $3.50 for nem neuong at Kim Do instead of $5.50 at Pho Bosa.

Don't come here to eat! The place is small and not welcoming. I came here on a Monday too."}
{"text":"went here at 2pm-ish on st. patty's day/ must've just missed the lunch rush bc it was completely empty.  combination pho (71) was very good. broth had a lot of flavor. it was slightly... mintier? (i think)... than other pho places i've been to but it was still very good.

got an iced coffee as well, but it was smaller than i expected.  usually i think places give 16 oz, but this looked like 10 oz. still good though.

location is kinda in the middle of nowhere, but i'm guessing most people don't have trouble finding it.  i took the 203 bus from the strip on sands/spring mountain rd and the place is right after your cross over the bridge (rt 15).  pull to request the stop right after you cross over as you could miss the stop (right after the adult superstore) and then the bus doesn't stop until valley view, which requires you to walk back a little bit."}
{"text":"By far the best pho place in town. The bun bo hue & pork sausage spring rolls are bomb! Our go to place after a night out drinking for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! I was here on vacation and wanted some pho because I was trying to get over a sickness and found this little gem. I was a bit hesitant to try it because it was in a little shopping center in the back and had a huge empty parking lot. BUT....like they say, \"don't judge a book by its cover\". 

I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had, perfect amount of spice the broth is totally on point, my gf and I each ordered the rare beef and I must say the saté they have is a little bit spicer then any other place I've encountered and I loved it, and the service was absolutely amazing(owners were some of the sweetest ppl I've ever met even stopped and had multiple conversations with us), yes it is a bit of a wait because it's a smaller establishment but I consider this a hidden gem in Vegas and will be making this my go to spot for my pho needs when I am in Vegas going forward. Thank you pho bosa for sending my taste buds on such a magnificent journey."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit, the food is so good. Nothing to complain about. This spot will beat most Vegas Pho restaurants in the near future. I'm assure you that!"}
{"text":"This place is so bad for first timer like me because the servers are rude, not patient while taking orders. They are in hurry while getting your order, so you feel irritated because they are rushing you."}
{"text":"This place takes way too long to serve your food. I understand things are being made fresh but waiting 30+ minutes for a bowl of pho is an oxymoron. 

If this place had shorter serve-times, I'd give this place 4 stars. The nem nuong cuon was delicious and had a nice crispness to it.

I had the BBH and was pleased. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was nevertheless good. Tried my friends pho and it ranks pretty high in pho I've had."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this store has great reviews. The food is pretty much sub par and the service is terrible. In fact, as soon as we get in, what seems to be the owner (a short Asian lady) gives us these terrible looks. On top of it, when she asks if we're ready to order and we're not, she scowls at us.

I got the normal Pho Tai and there was nothing too amazing about it. I guess you could give it a plus for not stinking. The chicken sausage wraps are wrapped in the soft shell and have this crunchy thing inside to give it a nice texture. I was a bit surprised that they didn't have your normal Shrimp wrap."}
{"text":"Tasty pho place. Good food, we all ordered pho noodle soups. Price is reasonable. Less than $9. Very busy place. Rare beef, beef ball and tenden were fresh. Gave you a good amout of meats."}
{"text":"I have never had such amazing service. Moises is so friendly and remembers you everytime you come back! The food is also wonderful and the meat in the pho is so delicious. If you're looking for great pho, you should definitely check this place out. Also their coffee is so delicious."}
{"text":"I think I am spoiled from living in Cali where pho is everywhere. I don't mind the prices. I was hoping for a wide variety of items to choose from and didn't see it. A simple menu is good, it means honing in on the best flavors for each dish that is offered.
Their Thai tea was amazing. And their place is small, slightly disappointed they didn't have banh mi options. Their pho soup base was good. I was torn about giving a 3 star or 4 star. I decided on 3 because of the lack of variety of menu options and the girl, who waited on us didn't come back to check if we needed refills or how we were doing."}
{"text":"First impression coming to Pho Bosa.. they got some good tasting spring rolls and some super good pho... well ya of course I will be back!!

Coming here on a Tuesday afternoon was just crazy and crowded.. I loved the set up of the place and how clean it was, but how the waitress brought out the utensils and plates made it somewhat unique because no other vietnamese spot that I go to bring out the sauce dishes and all in a basket and all the others.. which I really loved 

Ordering the the plain pho was good on its own.. i really didn't need the meat and the fixings all up in the soup plus it was very flavorful to eat!"}
{"text":"Most excellent Christmas breakfast.  The line was out the door at 10 AM.  Great service.  Authentic Vietnamese.   Not expensive.  Not fancy.  High quality"}
{"text":"We come to this restaurant every time visit Vegas.
It has the best beef and pork stew noodle, even better than little Saigon in LA in my opinion.
Only 5 mins drive from Mandalay Bay/Treasure Island, we get to eat quality Vietnamese food for 1/3 of the price compare to eating in the Casino."}
{"text":"Went to this placing looking forward to try their bun bo hue. This was not the case somehow they managed to run out of their speciality item bun bo hue by 5:00pm and to make it even worse they had a tv but it was broken so we could not watch game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.  So we had to make due and ordered #70 pho and bun rieu.  With my order of pho it seemed like they were cheap and the meat and did not have tripe!!  My friends who ordered the bun rieu said it was good and a decent size."}
{"text":"Stopped by Pho Bosa around 4pm last weekend after a long day out in the sun. We were the only diners there, were seated right away, and our food came out in ~5 minutes. 

I really wanted the bun bo hue but I opted for the pho because my stomach was already feeling a little queasy from day-clubbing. Only a large available for this, which I'm not complaining about because I enjoyed the heck out of my leftovers back at the hotel. The broth was ON POINT, and I think their meatballs are homemade so that's a plus. There was a good amount of meat in the bowl, but I was hoping for more noodles for a large."}
{"text":"Bosa is back! Now they server Pho now but after the long wait I ordered bun bo hue with shrimp cake & grilled large shrimp & ice coffee, everything taste great! The side order of grill large shrimp is a must try! Gotta try their Pho when I visited next time"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this place because of the 4 stars review on Yelp.  Like other reviews stated, it's located in a strip mall that slightly hard to find.  If you use Apple maps, it will get you in the vicinity but you have to a bit harder to find this little establishment.  
Three of us ordered Pho and two ordered Bun Bo Hue. Three of us agreed that the soup in pho was lacking the depth in flavor that we would normally find in Little Saigon.  The other two who ordered Bun Bo Hue had favorable comments - highly recommended.  Therefore, the next time we go here will be for the BBH.
Other notes about this restaurant.
Water - Please add reverse osmosis filter.  The water was awful!
Ice Coffee - not recommended.  They need to use better flavor beans like Arabica, not Robusta."}
{"text":"Small joint, but the food was great! The service was excellent too and the waiter had a good mood and was socializing with us. After 8 hours at edc we needed the pho to bring us back to life. Overall quality of food was delicious but the portions are kinda small. A large was more like a medium"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for our food, had to remind waiter and finally after almost an hour we got our food. The food itself was decent, not the best pho I have had, but very reasonable prices. 2 stars for having to wait, otherwise 3 stars."}
{"text":"\"Bun bo Hue\" (spicy beep noodle) very delicious.no where can compare. \"com tam bi suong cha\".(broken rice with pork chop)are genius, real Vietnamese taste, also \"nem cuon\" (spring roll) come with very delicious sauce. They just relocation here, they were at Jones/spring mtn. before. Very good Vietnamese cuisines."}
{"text":"the pho here is pretty good, location was pretty hard to find though since its sorta in a apartnent style complex...but not juding location, the food makes up for it yet i wiahed they gave me more =("}
{"text":"If you are trying to decide where to go for Vietnamese food and are overwhelmed with all the options Vegas has to offer then allow me to make it easy for you.... go here!!! :)

This place not only has great food but it's very clean. The place is small but since it's quite hidden you won't have a problem being seated right away. It's truly a hidden gem. Glad I found it via yelp. :D

Went with the parents. They had the pho with everything in it and I had grilled pork chops with a fried egg. Both were really flavorful!!! 

Service was great too  Mimi was our server. She was super pleasant and was very attentive to us. Great customer service. I am definitely coming bacj the next time im un town.

 I say to be like Nike and just do it... eat at Bosa!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and enjoyed everything about this place. Good customer service, food came out quickly and most important, delicious. Their spring rolls (nem noung) were on point with their signature dipping sauce. Their egg rolls were also delicious with their sides of lettuce, noodles, and their fish sauce was on the table for us to custom make how spicy we want it. Their pho came out in a big bowl with lots of meat, which my husband loves. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Vegas. Love the Com Tam Bi Cha Thit Noung, broken rice with grilled pork.  It's a hidden gem just off spring mountain."}
{"text":"I stopped in here, based on my fellow yelpers recommendations, on a friday evening. I called in advance and had ordered a bowl of pho for takeout. I arrived in the parking lot of the little strip mall where the restaurant is located within 5 minutes. 

As soon as I entered I was greeted by a man with a warm smile. The man, who was extremely friendly, had my pho waiting for me with all the fixings (including hoisin sauce and sriracha). 

After driving 20 minutes home, I opened my bag to find my pho steaming hot. I had the number 73 which is beef noodles with rare steak. From the minute I had my first bite, I knew I'd be a regular! This pho was SO FRESH and TASTY! I've had a lot of pho in my life, and I can say that this is at the top of my \"best of\" list.  I would highly recommend this place if you're near the strip and looking for a delicious and filling meal. I'm already plotting my next visit....."}
{"text":"9 of us came here on Sunday night.  Our waiter MO was super friendly and helpful.  He had suggested the pot stickers  and the crispy shrimp (which is like a lettuce wrap)  for appetizers and they both were great.  Then we of course  had a variety of their food choices. The  pho is excellent, I am picky with pho and never order it at a new place.  A few from our group did,  so of course I had to try it.  It was great, The broth was so full of flavor without even adding anything to it.  We tried there noodle and rice dishes as well and they were excellent.  I don't think this place has anything  I would not like.  Such a wonderful hidden gem to find with all the choices you have in vegas.  This is a must for every trip out here now."}
{"text":"I was iffy about this place because it was mostly empty inside and the only reason we came here was because the other pho place had a huge line. I had the pho tai. I think it is one of the best I ever had. The soup was so delicious and noodle was cooked perfectly.  Better than any pho I had in Los Angeles.  Will miss this taste."}
{"text":"Bun rieu was good but not as tomato-y as I would have hoped. BBH was really good. Had a good kick of lemongrass. Would order the bbh over the bun rieu next time"}
{"text":"The tables are kind of small. We had a party of 4 and asked for a slightly larger table. The guy didn't let us because he said they had to save larger tables for larger parties. Which is fine. But not many restaurants deny that. But as we ate our pho he got really busy so we understood why he wanted the larger tables available. 
The taste of the pho was great. They put a lot of meat and the soup was hot (just the way I like it) 
I believe they don't have different pho sizes but what I had was big. Comparing it to other places I've been, it's like a \"large\" bowl. Good pricing. 
The sauce for the pot stickers was amazing. 

We felt like our server/cashier was rushing us to leave. My boyfriend and cousin got done eating before myself and my other cousin. She kept coming by to ask us if we were done. I ate quickly cause I figured maybe they have others waiting for a table. As we walked out, there were still plenty of open tables left. I'm not sure why she was in a hurry to finish us up."}
{"text":"Unlike the cliché, \"I have no regrets...\"  I definitely regret coming here.  There was nothing good about this place.  Whether the atmosphere, decor, service, and food... you name it.  It was all bad.

This place is a dump.  The booths are unstable and are an accident waiting to happen.  The service was meh.  The food lacked substance.  I was severely disappointed given the positive reviews from Yelp!  The prices here are on the higher end of similar restaurants in the area.  Why?  I will never understand."}
{"text":"The food here is good and everything. The only thing I wasn't happy about was they automatically charge the tips on ur bill and I thought it was weird."}
{"text":"Food: average
Service: average
Ethics: shady

I usually don't review bills and just pay. Glad I did this time. I asked our waitress what 2 questionable items are for (non of them labeled) and she played it off looking at our table and saying she made a mistake. It wasn't busy. I left a $1 tip, she questioned me if it was accurate. Tips are discretionary and that's all she deserved. While it didn't take a long time for our food to come out, she never checked on us, my water didn't get filled until I was almost done. Note, their sign says their food can take 10-20 minutes to come out, double if they're busy. It's a pho restaurant, not fine dining."}
{"text":"It's our first time here. First time trying tofu spring roll. It's pretty great. Food was delicious. There were two servers at floor Mho was welcoming however there was this lady she was rude and we felt rushed."}
{"text":"This place has taken over as my favorite pho restaurant in Vegas. I don't even go to Pho Kim Long anymore. The pho broth is very flavorful and they also offer a lot of other authentic vietnamese dishes. I loved the lettuce wrapped fried eggrolls as well. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful. I am glad they opened in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The lady who took our order was rude as fuck lol. Okay bye!! Hahhaa pho kim luong it is. Don't go here to eat, they have terrible customer service lmao"}
{"text":"Pho sure!!!!
We crave pho sometimes and this is the only place we love.

We usually start with the crispy vegetable rolls and they come with a vegetarian sauce on the side. The order comes with five crispy fried vegetable rolls. On the big plate it has large leaf lettuce, cilantro, mint, pickled shredded veg, and sliced cucumber.
(I wanted a side of peanut sauce but she said \"oh no that sauce has chicken in it\"....pass :( 

We get the vegetarian pho and its is verrrry yummy. It is a surprisingly full flavored broth and the large bowl comes loaded with noodles, broccoli, fried tofu, green onions, and bok choy.

We also sometimes get the Noodle Salad Bowl it comes with your choice of meat so we get the fried tofu. The bowl  has noodles, shredded lettuce, pickled shredded veg, cucumber, dark purple Thai basil, fried tofu, and whole peanuts. I usually add the fresh mint and cilantro to the bowl. Sometimes I ask for a side of the vegetarian sauce and put a little on it.

Between the vegan pho and the vegan noodle salad bowl it's always a hard choice between the two because they are both good!

Their food is fresh and full of flavor. The vegetables are clean and snappy fresh and the service is always quick and pleasant always with a smile. 

We will continue to frequent Pho Bosa!!!!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good pho, close to the strip, free parking 

Slower service but they're really really busy! 

The bun bo hue is better than the pho.  There's a drink special of some sort that comes with your meal if you check in."}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue from Pho Bosa hit the spot after back to back days of drinking and eating things like pizza, burgers, and sandwiches in Vegas. Qualities of a good bowl of bun bo hue: really hot and spicy broth with a high broth to noodle ratio. The bun bo hue from Pho Bosa had all these qualities. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The pho here is very meaty!!! Very good taste and big portions. Also, affordable too. Great service and really nice people here. I will come back again :)"}
{"text":"This is just as good as Little Saigon, Orange County Vietnamese food. In fact, it's owned by a family that used to own a restaurant in Little Saigon before opening up shop in vegas. The bun thit nuong or pork vermicelli noodles are my favorite but the impressive thing is they are good at everything here. The Pho and Bun Bo Hue are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Good food, not to far from strip. And cheaper then most places around. Food is a little different then what I'm use to in Vancouver which is also cheaper. Place looks a bit sketchy, but who cares, food is good!"}
{"text":"I'll leave this review at a 3/5 because I didn't actually eat anything other then spring rolls, but my friends raved about their bun rieu being really delicious. Like .... THE BEST .. they've ever had \"delicious\".

Oddly enough no one in our group ordered the pho, which Pho Bosa takes time and effort to make, rather then have it all already set like majority of the pho restaurants one will go to. Think of them as the Jack in the Box of Pho? Your meal isn't made until ordered.

With that said, wait time is long (if busy). Rather 5-7 minutes, look for 15-20 minutes. May I also add this place is fishy? It's in a complex full of office buildings. And pricing is ridiculously expensive. $2-3 more."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Las Vegas.  Great service and always seems to be busy.  I recommend the tofu rolls and their famous Ice coffee..."}
{"text":"Last year, a sad day had fallen upon the Las Vegas community when word of Bosa 1, the amazing Vietnamese restaurant, would be closing its doors. To many peoples, including myself, this restaurant opened my eyes to the \"other\" world of Vietnamese cuisine... one which did not include pho. Here was the first time I had tried broken rice, bbq, and stir fried noodle dishes, that I have since tried at many other restaurants, but have not seen executed to the same high standard. What I missed most about Bosa 1 was that they did make, without a doubt, the best Bun Bo Hue in the Valley.

I was ecstatic to hear that the owner's were opening a new restaurant in Las Vegas called Pho Bosa, which would carry all of the items that Bosa 1 carried, as well as pho. Having procrastinated enough (they have been open for several months), I decided to check out the new location.

Pho Bosa is located on the intersection of Spring Mountain and Polaris. It is right next door to the 702 bar (for now anyways.. that bar has also been the Bikini Bar, and previously before that, the Sand Dollar Blues Lounge) There is plenty of parking, and you really can't miss the sign. After coming in, I was seated immediately by the hospitable host/server. After quickly looking over the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted. It was the dish I was missing the most.. Bun. Bo. Hue. I got a fried egg roll for an extra 1.50. After receiving my water and little side dish of thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime for my soup, my spring roll and soup was brought to me shortly thereafter. 

Egg Roll - crispy wonton shell with pork and veggies on the inside. The flavors tasted really well balanced and the shell wasn't too greasy. A little bit small, but tasted good.

Bun Bo Hue - For many of you who have never eaten anything but pho, and really want to try some of the other dishes of Vietnam (and have a liking for spicy foods), I really urge you to try Bun Bo Hue. At Pho Bosa, they make it really well. You can taste the ginger, lemongrass and shrimp in the broth. The chili oil that is mixed in the broth gives it a nice kick! The noodles are more thicker and rounder than ones you see in pho. The beef was tender, and so were the pig's knuckles. Don't be too put off by the congealed pigs blood. It doesn't have a metallic taste you find in beef blood, and IMO, the flavor was very neutral, almost like a tofu. One knock, I wish the broth could have been saltier (but maybe that's because i've been eating a lot ramen in the past year.. it has increased my sodium resistance).

Can't wait to come back and try their broken rice, and grilled specialties. I'm also curious to try their pho, and see how it stacks up against other pho places. The service here was also good."}
{"text":"Great pho taste, nice drink selection and pretty fast service.  They have one guy there that has a catchy sales pitch on drinks...i give him an A for effort and delivery.

Limited wait time while getting some delicious pho and drinks"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it was the day after a long night of drinking that made me really like this place. Their pho was good, on point, good amount, and tasty! Unfortunately, their AC doesn't work. They had huge fans blowing everywhere. Not a fan of restaurants with no cold AC. It was already hot enough in Vegas. -_-\" 

Anywho, I hope they get their AC fixed and start using it! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I typically give 5 stars for restaurants I would come back to and also recommend. 

We ordered the Nem Nuong and the Bun Bo Hue.  Growing up in SGV, not as much as OC but we still had a wide selection of authentic Vietnamese food.

However, after 7 years of living in Vegas, I have to say the Bun Bo Hue is so far one of the best I've had in town.  SGV good? No... But definitely something I would come back for in Las Vegas.

$8.99 for a bowl of pho is actually quite hefty.. But considering the location being so close to the strip (usually higher price point) and the ingredients (lots of tender meat) it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Great so far.
I would say Pho Hung from Toronto canada deserves 5 stars. 

This is the only pho place I've ever had in vegas but deserves 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"This was some of the cleanest pho I have ever had! We will be back for a late breakfast again tomorrow.. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here based on yelp review, and it did not disappoint.  Wanted to grab a quick late lunch or early dinner. The waiter was very nice and attentive.  He came to check on how we like our food and refill our drinks, which is rare in a typical asian restaurant. My friend loved the meatball and rare steak  pho broth and thought it was the best she ever tasting, and this is coming from someone living in CA.  I thought I will try something new and ordered the Bun Bo Hue.  The soup was spicy with lots of mixed vegetables and variety of meat. This not a dish for beginners. If you like authentic Bun Bo Hue, you will enjoy this dish."}
{"text":"This review is for to go order. We ordered 8 combo pho to go. When we receive the box, it was very leaky. Half the broth was spilled all over the place and the plastic container melted because of the heat. It was such a disaster."}
{"text":"Feeling hungover?  Tired of the strip life and need a moment to get yourself back in order to go again the next night in vegas?  Stop here and eat some amazing Pho.  Gets you going all over again.  Must go to place for all my friends and family when in vegas."}
{"text":"The food was great!  And the staff was even greater!!  Would recommend Pho Bosa to anyone."}
{"text":"The food and price is comparable to the rest of the Viet restaurants in the area. While we were there, a waiting line was forming for lunch, so it seems to be popular. It is a little hard to find, since it is on the side road."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue= one size only (large), spicy, and very oily. The oil stuck to my spoon as I ate and it was a thick layer of oil. I would not order this again

Nem Nuong roll= pretty damn good. But not compared to brodards in SoCal. 

Pho= broth was good. The portion was huge. That's all I remember. 

There was a line. This place is popular.  It's also located right next door to this bar that was on TV, Bar Rescue channel 45 lol."}
{"text":"We got the pho ga and pho tai. Both were great. Service was fast. I wish they had small bowl for kids. No worries though we split in 1/2. All was splendid."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho brisket and beef balls. Soup was super salty. I asked for hot water to dilute the broth still super salty. The meat was thick and chewy.  Maybe I came in on an off day but never coming here again. Service was decent, only reason why I'm giving it an extra star. Btw card min charge is $25."}
{"text":"Very delicious! I had a the typical beef noodle soup and pork chop and rice special.  The broth was very flavorful.  It's better than what I can get in New York.  The service was great also."}
{"text":"The food here is good as well as the service. I love their rice and grilled pork spring rolls."}
{"text":"I have been to almost every pho place in Vegas with my boyfriend and this is now our only option for pho . The food was PHOnomenal;) I have never written a Yelp review and I had to for the great service . The servers were fast and personable and made me want to keep coming back !"}
{"text":"The only place I go to for good Bun Bo Hue. The broth is where it is at and the quality of their meat is super tender."}
{"text":"I'm only writing this review because Antonia R blows up IG at least twice a month with drool-worthy photos of bun rieu and the pork rolls. Naturally, I came in for those specific dishes, plus a bowl of their namesake pho and a Vietnamese iced coffee.

The good news is that the two dishes above are awesome. Rolls (#1, $5.50) have a great mix of meaty pork patty plus crunchy fried onion and fresh lettuce for a medley of flavors and textures. Bun Rieu (#79, $9) is a crab and tomato soup (with plentiful portions of both!), plus noodles, fried tofu pieces, and cilantro and fried onion for garnish. It is so dang good, hearty but not heavy, my new go-to dish here.. and I'll be on the lookout for it elsewhere now, too.

But they're primarily a pho restaurant, and the #70 we ordered (their basic house specialty?) was pretty plain with a light broth that needed the extra condiments and fresh herbs. Soup portions are enormous, with huge bowls of broth and more meat and noodles than many other places. Regulars seem to find very specific dishes to get here rather than recommending everything offered. 

TIPS: Closed Mon and Tues, $25 card minimum (dang!), and no split checks. Despite those inconveniences and the sketchy location, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a place with good savory broth and good portions. 
Pho Bosa has both and their menu is filled with other items and unique beverages.  

I find myself coming back to this place because I crave for their soup. I always order #72 the rare steak and beef ball soup and it is always delicious. The beef balls are never over done and compliment well with the soup. 

They are also not over priced. This place is a block or two down from chinatown. gotta love cheap eats in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"This was a cute spot.  Heard a lot of great things about their other dishes.  Has decent service and us nice and clean.  I was slightly disappointed in the Pho Tai.  I believe it was cut with chicken broth because of the tell tale yellow fat bubbles floating on the top that you don't get many of in a pure beef broth. I would go again for other dishes"}
{"text":"I was very happy to find a Vietnamese restaurant with vegetarian broth for pho. The pho was filled with fresh vegetables and tasty tofu. My husband had a vermicelli bowl that looked amazing and tasted great too. Everything was fresh and bright. I would definitely recommend! The only downside was the Vietnamese coffee. I like mine traditional, and this one came premade in a plastic cup. I didn't particularly like the taste, but this isn't enough to knock off a star."}
{"text":"Delicious pho broth which is everything ! & wonderful customer service along with clean atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Chicken soup, customer service, friendliness, spoke well English was amazing!!!  The soup was seasoned to perfection coupled with tender chicken.  I'd frequent this restaurant again :)."}
{"text":"Pho Tai in a very clean, not salty or oily broth, some may find it as lacking flavor, I find it as just right.  Lots of rare beef pieces and a good amount of broth.  The pork spring rolls were good with the crispy egg roll skin in the middle for the crunch.  The fresh sugar cane juice was a fantastic compliment.  Next time I may have to try the coconut sugar cane, shortened to coco-cane."}
{"text":"Pho was okay, maybe I had too much over the weekend so I couldn't eat their pho or what but I would recommend their cococane drink"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place. Nice restaurant, food are good and authentic. Service sare friendly"}
{"text":"24 hour pho...something I wish existed here in Omaha. Pho Bosa boasts a pretty decent menu, I stuck with large (one size) Pho dac biet- the combo with meatballs, fatty brisket, flank, tripe and tendon usually. This version lacked the tripe but that's ok, everyone has their own way of making it. Broth was pretty good- not the best I have had but hit the spot for the craving we both had that day. It'll do the trick for hangovers, hints of a cold, late night food, and much more. It's a comfort food for many Asians and Americans so I know they'll do just fine with business being so close in proximity to the strip (you'll still need a car or taxi though). We also ordered the Nem Nuong (spring roll) which is another of my favorites. Brisk service and quick food-to-table. The only weird part was paying for our meal. They brought an ipad to the table to run the card and then straight up asked what we wanted to leave for tip. Very strange and kind of rude! I like the privacy of deciding myself and selecting it. Otherwise, it was a good solid meal and we enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"You can say that my expectations for pho has increased over the years, and I most definitely can tell from good to bad pho. Ladies and gents, this establishment served a disappointing bowl of pho for a high price. For close to 9 bucks a bowl, I am thinking that this pho has to be mind blowing. But unfortunately the pho dac biet that I ordered was tasteless, vegetables weren't fresh, and the bowl size would be considered a regular size compared to others. Staff had to be constantly reminded of water refills and taking our order. Will be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I'm basically ridiculous and decided to walk here from the Strip even though Las Vegas is NOT a walking city. This involved a weird detour-ladden walk (~2.5 miles!) that included walking across a highway. It was cold, treacherous, and totally worth it. 

But take my advice: don't walk. Just take a cab. Seriously. Unless you're also ridiculous, in which case, hi!! :) :) :)

The service was awesome, though I think our waiter isn't one of the full-time ones. He asked if we had been there before, and when we told him we hadn't, he explained all the dishes to us and gave us his recommendations!

We got the #11 broken rice combo with grilled pork, which was absolutely delicious. I haven't had \"shrimp cake\" before, but it was oh-so-good in all the right ways.

We also got the Bun Bo Hue, which was very flavorful and delicious. (I did my research and tried this at another restaurant before posting this review, and while the other restaurant's food was yummy, the Bun Bo Hue here was the winner!) The waiter described this to us as \"spicy soup\".

Bun Rieu was also very good (waiter just called this \"crab soup\").

[[The waiter kept checking on us at this point to ask if we needed a box, since we were a party of 2 and had ordered 3 entrees. We finished them. Cuz we're awesome. I think he was confused.]]

The waitress that was working that night processed our bill on an iPad. We asked about which taxis were good, but I think she got confused because she just left without responding. The waiter that had been helping us came back later to refill our waters and offered to call us a cab when he figured out that we didn't have a car.

Five stars for service and food!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Portions are huge. But my favorite was the sugar cane + coconut juice they had. It was so refreshing and unique since I've never had it anywhere else before! Very impressed and can't wait to go back when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall: If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a repeat customer.

Pros: The pho broth, which is the most important element to a pho dish, was correctly stewed with beef bones and spices. It was well-balanced and aromatic.  The bun bo hue also had all of the correct ingredients--blood cubes and all. 

Cons: Lemon instead of lime was served with the pho, likely due to increased lime costs. However, the lime is irreplaceable. Also, most of the bun bo hue I've eaten in my day is several levels hotter. This one was only mild-medium spicy; not nose running spicy as I've experienced before. I think this is the type of soup that calls for more spiciness."}
{"text":"I was starving after a long night of drinking. I came to this establishment for a hot bowl of pho. I couldn't be seated because my full party hasn't arrived. The place wasn't even busy. I asked to be seated so I can order some appetizers and water but the manager refused to seat me. So I end up waiting for 20 minutes. Now I'm very hangry. Moral of the story, If you are hungry and your party is not with you, don't come here. Also, check your chopsticks for mold."}
{"text":"Really great pho here. They use better ingredients than places like Pho Kim Long which translates into much more authentic  Vietnamese dishes.  The grandmother always greets us so well and Mosis, the waiter, is awesome.  Like many have already mentioned, the Bun bo hue is their staple, do try it.  This is our regular spot, and it's great that people are recognizing it as the top pho place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is quite close to the strip. Nice noodles and great new kinds of spring rolls! :) i always visit here for my vegas trip, especially in the morning after the crazy night"}
{"text":"We had large party and we had order lot of food but quality of food is not good and service was really bad. Lady gave us mean looks and stare at us if we requested anything else.  Prices are very high compare to other pho restaurant no fried rice or other types of noodles except pho noodles!! Bathrooms are not maintain or clean. 
In the end mean lady threw tantrum at us and starting using F bombs at us for requesting a bag for our food."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time and enjoyed our meal.  The menu is overwhelming, the portions are huge.  I had the Combo Pho minus all the toppings and it was good.  My friend had a noodle dish and she enjoyed every bite, she ended up taking the rest home.  My friend and I would probably be back again."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place!! From the outside it looked kind of weird.. like a 24/7 spa place LOL but I definitely give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this restaurant, only because the people in Orange County raved about it, but then again it was a family member of this restaurant owner. The food was mediocre at best. Definitely not the best in Vegas. I ordered the bun bo hue. It was good, but not awesome. There was a lot of msg in the broth. I left with a big headache and thirsty for hours.

Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hidden gem off the strip! Delicious!! Had the rare beef pho, my friend had the brisket & meat ball pho, Total check less than $20!"}
{"text":"Broken rice and vermicelli dishes are the best I've had in Las Vegas!  Everything is very fresh and ohhh so tasty!  The owners and staff are wonderful, nice people as well. With the new location, the size of the restaurant is now larger and we haven't had to wait as long as it could get at their older locale."}
{"text":"Came here thinking this was one of the better pho places based on the reviews. The broth was very plain. Especially after adding the bean sprouts and basil, it basically tasted watered down. I could barely eat the noodles because it tasted like noodles just boiled in hot water. 

Their 14 ingredient sauce for the spring rolls was very good though except the spring rolls didn't even have any noodles in it!

Service was great, but I won't be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Had a little hangover and was desperate for some vietnamese cuisine. 
Found this place a little bit off the strip and decided to give it a shot. 

I always get Pho Ga (chicken soup) and this place completely nailed it. I've been to plenty of mediocre pho places that add the typical ingredients. This place adds fried garlic! Great Addition to this amazing soup.

I would definitely recommend this place is your looking for Pho Ga."}
{"text":"this place , pho bosa, is also known and yelp reviewed , as Bosa Boba"}
{"text":"Service was nice. Ordered pho with brisket, rare steak and beef balls. Also ordered fish cake and chicken spring rolls. Pho was awesome, just what I was craving..I asked for extra lime on the side and the gave us plenty. Fish came was good and crispy. Spring rolls were not my flavor but I read a lot about the vegetarian spring rolls so I'll get those next time, which will pro be today! Location was a little tough for our Uber to find and nothing special inside, but was clean and staff friendly. We also got the whole fresh coconut which was refreshing after the Vegas sun and tasted like dessert! Loved it. Will be back!

(Back today!! - & we got their new special: \"Cococane\" which is the whole fresh coconut + sugar cane juice! Soooo good!
Also got the vegetarian spring rolls and we preferred them over chicken ones) 
Our server remembered us and brought us extra limes. Love this place :)"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Pho Bosa since they were called Bosa 1 back at their old location, and I am a fan because of they have consistently delicious food.  Apparently their fan base is growing and has followed them to the new location.  We went back about a week ago (to start off our wedding anniversary celebration) and it was cray cray in there!  We felt so bad because they didn't have enough staff to keep up with the demand!  One look at the staff - you could see that they were sweatin' bullets!  My point of this observation is that Pho Bosa usually has friendly service and consistent eats.  

Our usual fav's:
Bun Bo Hue
Bun Rieu
Nem Nuong Cuon!
Cafe Sua Da

I heart Pho Bosa."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service I've received in a very long time. I ordered what the server recommended and everything was absolutely phenomenal. Will definitely be back again and again.

Forgive me for not having proper combo names;
Pork Summer Rolls: really good, fresh tasting. The veggies were crumchy and the sausage was flavorful. The peanut sauce was a nice touch as well. Not a thick thai-satay style sauce, but thin with a touch of vinegar. 
Grilled Chicken platter with shrimp cake and egg roll: AMAZING. Can chicken really taste this good? I wasn't sure that I'd like the shrimp cake at first, but the taste was amazing- not at all mushy like I had expected. The egg roll left much to be desired, but I overlooked that.
Combination Pho: Brisket, raw thin sliced beef, tendon, and beef balls. The soup was really nice and light- perfect if you like your soup plain or gives you plenty of room for \"improvement\" if you like mixing your soup to taste. 

The service was what really put this place over the top. Our server, I regret not to have asked his name, not only helped me choose every aspect of my meal but also helped to mix the sauce that went over the dish and give me tips on how I'm supposed to eat it. Really nice guy."}
{"text":"We just love pho bosa.  It's probably the only pho place that's not full of MSG.   It's not cheap but I think it's worth every bite.  The service is always amazing.    They even put my Togo food in my glass containers with smile.   I just think styrofoam is not that safe for food and we started carrying glass food containers everywhere we go.  Except most restaurants would give me a weird look or I would have to explain the reasons for being Environmental responsible.   This is the only place that don't give me weird look.  The tasty food is definitely a plus as well"}
{"text":"The flavor of the beef combo pho is outstanding....one of the best that I have enjoyed.  I will return on my next trip! Give it a try if you like pho!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, don't let the outside fool you.  If you need to get your Pho on this is the place.  Love the menu items."}
{"text":"Please don't ever eat bun bo hue here. It is bland, tasteless, and carry a slight scent of carrot. 
I don't know why they add a hint of carry into the soup.
Overall we ordered 6 bowls of bun bo hue and 5 were left back behind."}
{"text":"First time trying Pho and I decided to come here based off of vegan options and great reviews and I'm sooo glad my boyfriend and I came. 

First of all, Mo, our server was amazing. Hands down. He made us feel so welcome and accommodated our every need. Oh and he had all the PHO-nny puns ;)  sweet guy.

The vegetarian egg rolls are VEGAN! Apparently there's no egg, so that was pleasantly surprising. They were delicious and I'd definitely order them again. 

I got the vegetarian pho and my boyfriend got something with lots of meat and blood and stuff... I LOVED mine! It had a very flavorful broth, lots of veggies and tofu! Yum! Mo also gave us some garlic and Thai chili to add for flavor and boy that made the flavor stand out. 

My boyfriend on the other hand didn't like his food at all. I think it was the blood that threw him off. Boyfriend actually thought mine was much better after tasting it and will get what I ordered the next time we come here. 

Everything about my experience here was great and I would definitely come back for more VEGAN PHO!"}
{"text":"Rude lady.  The place was nearly empty and they pointed me and my wife to a tight corner table with a bench that has nothing to lean back on.  We asked if we can have the adjacent table. \"NO!  That table for customers with 4 people!\", then walks away.  We were a little taken back by the crude response so we left and went to Nem Nuong Bistro right down the road and received great food and service."}
{"text":"We were driving back to Vegas from Zion national park and stopped by this place because it was on our way. The place was pretty empty when we got there but filled up as time went by. All of us got the combination (#70). It only came in one size, but the bowl was pretty big and well worth the $8.50 for it. I couldn't finish mine but my dad and brother managed to finish theirs.
The plate of herbs had more than enough bean sprouts on it which was awesome and had the usual limes and jalepenos on the side. However, the only herb on it was Thai basil. Would've been nice to have culantro/mint/cilantro as well. 
The broth was delicious and steaming hot. I thought it was a little salty but the bean sprouts and the noodles balanced it out. There was no tripe which was sad but even so there was a ton of meat.
Overall everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place you'd drive by and be curious about due to its location, but worth stopping in. 
Their new location feels comfortable and makes it easy if you're eating alone--The place is spacious and has TV.

Ordered #71 the steak + beef ball (so glad they have that combo) and everything was great. 
The broth wasn't too greasy, portions were enough and it was made fresh. 

Pho is always my go-to hangover cure and I think I found my new favorite place to make it. Whenever I'm craving Pho, the drive would be worth it."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian pho with actual vegetarian based soup. After a night on the town for a bachelorette party, a hot bowl of soup was calling out to me. I called a few places to make sure that they're vegetarian pho was indeed vegetarian and this place made the cut! Some places omit the meat and still serve the beef broth with the veggie pho so beware! 

The broth had a nice mushroom flavor to it. I ordered my noodle soup with extra veggies and sans tofu and it was absolutely delicious! It hit the spot and furthermore, gave me a nice little food coma  

My cousin ordered the special and she thought it was amazing! We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"11-9-15
After 3 years of pho \"adventures\" this place is still the best {because of their fancy chilly sauce}

5-24-2017
This pho joint has new owners and moved to a bigger place close to the original location. 
Tried out the pho with shrimp and it was even better than last time!!
This is definitely the best shrimp pho I ever had, roping out pho 54 in Garden Grove, Ca!
If you come by and like pork spring rolls, try them here...


Nice work !"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic pho. There's a bit of a wait, but well worth it. Would eat again."}
{"text":"Stop by for lunch on the way home from Vegas. I ordered the pho with everything in it and it only come in larger. I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish it but the large was even more than the larger I get back at home. It was basically xlarge for only 8.99, which wasn't bad but it was just too much for me. I wish they have small sizes, but the waiter was extremely friendly and nice. He even joked around with us and was really chill."}
{"text":"Better than other popular pho places in Vegas but not good enough for the price tag.  They also charge a \"service fee\" which they say is for clean up, etc but they don't consider it \"gratuity.\" Maybe it's a Vegas thing."}
{"text":"Visiting vegas and we wanted some Pho. Found this place and I am very impressed.

Big selection of items. 

Ordered:
Pork Sausage Spring Rolls - must get
Combination Pho
Beef Pho
Deep Fried Pork Egg Roll

this has become one of my viet places. All fresh and hot. Good prices
Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Appreciate the new location as it is bigger and better than their old one.

Best bun rieu ever. No questions asked.

Friendly and engaging staff too :)"}
{"text":"BEST. VIETNAMESE. FOOD. EVER!! 
Omg, I love this place. This place hits home. They have fresh coconut juice, too! (For that Vegas hangover, haha.) Some people may stick to the pho places on the strip for convenience, but it's not too far off the strip and definitely worth the few minutes of drive. The pho broth is so flavorful and clean, and the meats are so nice and tender. The Bun Rieu is really good too, and they make sure to give you a plentiful amount of crab/shrimp meat. 
Last and most favoriteeeeee part of this place is their Nem Nuong Cuon. Best I've ever had. The pork is so flavorful and fresh, and the fried egg roll wrapper has the perfect crunch. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Their Pho was nothing special even with a hangover (which usually amplifies the tastiness of Vietnamese food by ten-fold).

The Bun Rieu however was very flavorful (loved the broth). The crab meat tasted fresh. I'd probably either get the Bun Rieu or the Bun Bo Hue.

This place probably has one of the best Phos near the Strip...but that really doesn't say much."}
{"text":"Three stars for average food. Not sure if I'm being too critical but I know good pho when I try it... and this was decent. My dad wasn't pleased with the soup of the pho nor the com tam. My little brother thought it was okay. Service was average. Nothing special to come back to but I'm pretty sure compared to other pho places around, it ranks on the higher end."}
{"text":"Yestuaday I was stop by pho bosa and I was order bun Bo hue  it is a unforgettable Vietnamese soup excellent"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. I love pho and this place definitely makes the grade"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a high rating the moment I arrived because of how friendly the host/waiter was. Moe was a very fun and happy go lucky waiter but unfortunately, this was the only memorable thing about this place for me :(

I tried the bun bo hue as well as the pho with brisket and rare beef. The broth was too sweet for my liking for both noodle soups. I'm from Orange County and so I know I'm a bit picky since I'm spoiled with all the good eats (especially Vietnamese food) but even while being \"lenient,\" I was still utterly disappointed. 

The chanh muoi drink was refreshing but it's a pretty fool proof drink to whip up!

Was hoping it'd hit the spot because I was dying for pho while visiting Vegas but this place just didn't do. 

Two stars solely for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Okay...i promised in my previous review i was going back to try out the rice plate or the Bun Bo Hue...didnt exactly plan on going back the next day but hey what ever; go where life takes you right?

Left out from my previous review but dont feel like editing it. 
Number 15 on the drinks. Sua Dau Nanh La Dua (soy bean milk with pandan leaf)
It's been a long time since i've had soy bean milk and the kind with pandan leaf is a rare treat. So i was expecting a can of Yeo brand soya milk with pandan leaf that comes from Singapore i think. When they released this flavor i used to not drink a can but inhale a can. Anyway what i was brought out was in a togo container. Punching the straw through and taking a sip i realized that holy shit this is home made soy bean with pandan extract added. Nice!! not overly sweet but not bland either. Could have used more pandan leaf extract but i'm just weird like that.

Alright back to today. Well if i'm gonna order something with the intent to review it i might as well order it big:
Number 11. Tau Hu Ky, Bi Cha with number 16 Thit Nuong
(shrimp cake, shredded pork loin, pork quiche with additional grilled pork)

The portion size is pretty big and the meal itself was quite tasty and impressive. The grilled pork was the tastiest on the plate. Marinated quite well and the thin cuts absorbed enough seasonings to be both tasty but not dry and rubbery and doesn't get in those hard to reach places in your teeth.

Yup Bosa 1 is back and better then ever."}
{"text":"We arrived here for lunch before our road trip back home.  The place was packed and we had to wait about 10-15 min for a party of 6.  I read the mixed reviews for the Bun Bo Hue and wanted to give it a try.  First we ordered the pork spring rolls and I must say they make a very good, fresh spring roll! The pork meat was warm and they give a house sauce that was different, but good- we just added some spice to it. My husband ordered the pho and it was flavorful and good. Now to the Bun Bo Hue, it was not impressive or flavorful. The meat was plentiful and good, but the broth was the opposite- bland & mediocre. The service was very friendly & cashier made me laugh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  In a town full of Ramen but short on really good Pho, this hit the spot.  They have vegetarian and gluten free options too.  And the staff are so friendly and super helpful.  Next time I'm saving room for the dessert (special price on yelp)"}
{"text":"Pho - Delicious, could use more meat.
Bun Bo Hue - good amount and tender meat. Soup could  be more flavorful, but overall I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here after church because my parents wanted broken rice and said this is one of the better places for broken rice. The place is pretty hidden from the Main Street, prob won't know it's there if you are just driving by. We came in around 11 on Sunday, they had 4 tables already sat. We were seated immediately and all got different variation of broken rice. 

Overall the food was pretty good. They bring out nice silverware compared to other Viet places where you get the cheap plastic ones. The portion was smaller than when they first opened but I was still stuffed. The tofu (tau hu ky) was good, very crispy and we got big pieces too. I also got cha which was ok, nothing impressive but also not the worst I have had. And got a fried egg on mine. Parents added meat to theirs and they said the meat had good flavors. 

Service was good, very polite staff, water and tea came out quickly. And I liked that their tea was dark, stronger than other places, some places very you very light tea, like... just yellow water. 

Some cons:
-waited 30 minutes for our food 
-they do not split checks - the table next to us wanted to split and the waitress simply said \"no\" lol
-they auto-grat for our part of 5... not sure if it is because of CES but isn't it usually party of 6 or more?!?
-they did not tell us that gratuity was included, the waitress gave us the iPad and told us to pick one of the options for the tips - if we hadn't looked at the physical check we would have tipped again.. a little shady"}
{"text":"Vegas party-goers need to know about Pho Bosa. The best thing for your hungover, dehydrated-self is an awesome bowl of steaming hot Pho when you finally decide to roll over and wake up. The broth here is awesome and the portions are generous. The egg rolls are smaller than what I get at my favorite pho restaurant back home (Golden Deli, San  Gabriel), but still very satisfying.

There is plenty of parking and they also take credit cards!"}
{"text":"This is a busy place off to the side in Chinatown. I was dying for a bowl of #plantpowered pho. I had the veggie pho; it appeared to be the only vegan thing on the menu. It was somewhat expensive for a bowl of pho, but no more than VegeNation. The broth was a little bland. I do like the Bok Choy that is added to these dishes. In short, limited choices, quick service, serviceable pho."}
{"text":"So GOOD Pho You.

At the behest and strong recommendation of a fellow foodie/yelper, we made time during a recent Vegas trip to try out more places off the strip.  Thankfully, Pho Bosa ended up on our list as the visit and meal was truly memorable.

LOCATION:  In a fairly nondescript shopping complex not too far from the strip.  Since it was SOCLOSE, we decided to venture to the restaurant without the aide of a navigation app or device.  Long story of a short drive:  We arrived without incident at our destination 10 minutes prior to opening.

SETTING/AMBIANCE:  The restaurant is quite cozy, and has a very home-like feel to it.  Very casual.  A mix of tables and booths make up the seating area.

FOOD:  Since it was my first time, I chose to let my friend take the lead in ordering.  And speaking the of food, the menu is massive.  Many selections of drinks, appetizers, food combos (chicken, pork, sausage, etc.), and pho.  We shared the springs rolls and we each ordered the Bun Bo Hue pho.  

The pork sausage spring rolls were quite good and were the perfect start to our meal.  As for the pho, though the Bun Bo Hue is served spicy, I admit I was a coward and requested a mild broth. And sans the infused pork blood as well.  I wasn't sure how my stomach would handle such a thing.  The entire bowl seemed massive to me when the server dropped it off the food at our table.  But, I saw, I ate, and I conquered my pho.  The rice noodles, beef shank, pork, onions, herbs, and lime in the lemongrass beef broth was simply delicious.

SERVICE:  Decent service.  Not bad but not fantastic.  The server checked on us throughout the meal and readily provided water refills.

CAFFEINE:  This was also my first time trying Vietnamese coffee.  All I can say is that I was WIDE AWAKE after the meal.  

BOTTOM LINE:  It was pretty good, and I'm sure it will be good pho others too.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Good service and polite.. Everything we had here were good.. Portions are huge.. We got the Bun Rieu, Bun Bo Hue, and Pho which were all good, not the best I ever had but it's up there.. But this is a must try joint.. Wouldn't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"terrible management, came in and ask for table of 17 when 12 of us are already here. wasn't willing to let us sit. some guy called himself manager and keep asking \"are you sure? otherwise we will be charged $50 extra?\" saying it is during busy EDC season but there were more than enough seats to sit us. c'mon, i dont care how good your pho is but with this type of attitude i hope your business will prosper."}
{"text":"I had the bun bo hue. The soup was a bit bland. The veggies didn't seem to go well with the soup. I prefer bean sprouts and lettuce head with mint. 
I inquired about the eggrolls and the waiter told me it is $1 extra for each. He failed to tell me it is a dollar extra on top of their $1.25 listed price.
So my soup cost $9 and 2 small eggrolls cost me $4.50.... half of my main entree. What a ripoff.

Not sure if I'll come back to try other entrees. The appetizers are just too way over priced.

For the idiot that sent me a so called \"compliment' about eggrolls being a $1 extra that is exactly what it means... not $1 extra on top of the $1.25 on the menu. The waiter needs to clarify. If you go buy a burger and the employee ask you if you would like fries for a $1 extra you don't expect it to be $2.25....

If that doesn't make sense to you then oh well..."}
{"text":"I have to recommend this restaurant to everyone locals and tourists. It's not very far from the strip. 

So far in Vegas by far the best Vietnamese dishes I've had since moving from Southern Cali. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful explaining the menu and what they specialize in.

The quality of food and the place itself is very clean and quality."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked in and wasn't greeted or acknowledged for 5 minutes until we had to tell them we were there. Even when we asked if we would be seated, the waiter brushed us off and said hold on and walked away. Such horrible service we left. Shame on the owner for hiring careless employees"}
{"text":"Okay, i don't know if it was just a off day for these guys. But the pho we had there was not that good at all. The broth was just way to much cinnamon taste to it. And it made it a bitter taste to the whole pho bowl. The spring roll was different.  And it was okay."}
{"text":"We just stopped by rio to get show tickets and my friend saw a pho place, but it was ridiculously priced. So we decided to yelp and found this place. 

There's a small waiting area where we sat to decide what we wanted for dinner. Right when we were about to go up to the cashiers desk to order this gentleman came to us instead. Mo was super friendly and professional. Not only did he come take our order, he even walked us out to our car and loaded the food for us. We didn't even ordered much, there was only 4 of us lolx. Mo alone deserves 10/5 stars!!! BEST SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN VEGAS ^~^

Food was filling and delicious. We had 2 pho + 2 com tam (broken rice) dishes...it's pho, how can you ever go wrong! 
Facility was very clean and organized. Service was fast, but this weekend was pretty dead. So, I'll have to see if service is still up to par the next time we come back ^~^"}
{"text":"I just come for the Pho, rare steak please.  Best remedy for a hangover.  Service is always great, attentive, and location has expanded so you don't have to go outside to use the restroom anymore."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there after the night of party - the place was dead we literally went there 30 min after they opened.. people started to walk in and it got busier. Pho was pretty good and service was very good also."}
{"text":"I came to this joint since it was opened. Originally the owner used to run a pho place around Jones x Spring Mountain but now moved to this previously motel location. They often have mechanical/ac problem and had to close. I came so many times I have never seen a roach so the reviewer is totally wrong. 

Com Tam is the best here and second is the Bun Bo Hue. Bun Rieu is okay but my sister likes it here. I don't like it because it is too watery and too much eggs. I want real crabs. Bun Rieu is supposed to be a Vietnamese ciopinni. It supposed to have real seafoods and not eggs!!!! It is supposed to be red like ciopinni. That's what is it!!! Whatever. I also like the pennywort (gotu kola) drink with bean. It tastes like they are extraction from the leaves in lieu of imitation.  

People are finding the place. It gets really busied during rush hours so we are avoiding it by coming early. Back then when they first opened it was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Went here for Pho after I was feeling a little under the weather. The pho was decent, price and quality. The pork sausage spring rolls are actually uncooked rolls which I always thought were called summer rolls. The broth was ok, but location was good and would consider going again if I was in town."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Pho Bosa for a while now, love their rice dish."}
{"text":"This place is located in a shady-looking building. Their noodle bowls are huge but they also cost $9-10 which is pretty pricey for Viet food. The bun bo hue is actually pretty good and I would come here for that if craving it while in Vegas. Their bun rieu is supposed to be good but I was not a fan. The pho was just ok. Better than AZ pho but not close to CA or home-made.  Their nem nuong rolls were also large and tasty."}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite spot for Vietnamese food in Vegas! Located just a block before all the pho king longs and the pho me toos and whatever clever name you can think of that's pho related. When you arrive, you may think you're at the wrong location because the plaza looks deserted. Sure enough, you are in the right location.

The food is legit! The quality of the food is what makes it legit. You go to these other popular places full of drunks or the aftermath-hangovers it's loud and busy. But Pho Bosa, you won'y find that. It's much smaller so they are more attentive. The lady was even willing to customize a plate for one of us. Normally rice dishes take longer than the other items on the menu. We didn't have to wait for that dish before everyone can start eating.

I'm definitely making this my to-go place for pho whenever I'm in Vegas and if you're part of the crew, I'll make a fan out of you."}
{"text":"We were kind of taken back from the outside look and couldn't see anything inside from outside.  We almost turned back to find different restaurants. But it was a pleasant surprise since we began to see the food coming out.  Everything was tasty!pork chop was good.  Service was excellent as well.  I am willing to go back whenever I am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"My wife is Vietnamese and whenever we are in Las Vegas (2-3 times a year) we invariably get burned out on all The Strip restaurants and buffets during our stay. That's when we head down Spring Mountain Road to Pho Bosa.

No matter what day of the week or what time of day or how busy Pho Bosa is, we can always get a table without much of a wait.

I usually have a big bowl of Beef Pho and my wife gets a rice dish and we add one of the noodle dishes. The food is always fast to come out of the kitchen and the order is always right. 

The servers/staff seem to have sort of assigned areas/station but actually they all take care of any table they pass, if you need anything.

The prices are not super cheap but the servings are ample and the quality is excellent. The food is delicious and authentic. So, I consider Pho Bosa an excellent value based on all merits.

It's amazing that I see some low reviews of Pho Bosa here on Yelp because I haven't experienced a bad meal there. I am either very lucky or the other folks here on Yelp are unlucky or perhaps people were in a bad mood on both sides of the table. Maybe it wasn't their day but for me; I love Pho Bosa."}
{"text":"After a night out on the strip, my friends and I have started making Pho Bosa our place to refuel. Located ~1.5 mil from the strip, this is pretty easy to get to via taxi/uber/walking etc. 

I've only had the pho and it's more than enough. The broth is flavorful and they give a pretty substantial amount of beef. There is only one size and is probably a decent amount for a guy but could even be too much for some. Not much more to say about the food but...

The service is pretty mediocre. For pho, the wait is WAY too long. We even had to flag someone down just to get our food ordered in the first place. Pho should come out of the kitchen pretty quick and yet we found ourselves waiting a good 15 min and it wasn't even that busy in the restaurant. Nevertheless, I'll likely be back..."}
{"text":"I've always gone to this place when I'm in Vegas! Love the Smokey Oxtail Pho!!! I am a pho enthusiast the absolutely do it flawlessly. Usually don't like a twist in my pho but the smoked oxtail was executed so well. The cococane (coconut plus sugar cane) drink was awesome as well! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I should have been coming here instead of Pho Kim Long all these years visiting Las Vegas. Don't get me wrong, PKL is awesome because it's good and is open 24/7 and has lots of spacious seating.  But the wait is usually 30-45 minutes at minimum since everyone needs their hangover cure.

Pho Bosa tastes just as good (probably, I mean come on, it all tastes good after a night of clubbing).  I'd definitely rather come here with no wait than PKL.  Plenty of parking, no line, decent seating.  Party of 9 was seated immediately at 1130AM on a sunday.

Aside from the lack of crowd and wait, the pho is really good here.  Additionally, they are really popular for their bun bo hue and also serve bun rieu, which is hard to find decent quality of.  Go ahead and tell your taxi to come back in the morning to take you here!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for \"Com Tam\" (broken rice). Most restaurants have a few of these dishes but this place specializes in it and have tons and tons of options. They also have your typical dishes like Pho and Bun Bo Hue but you go here for the Com Tam as the other dishes are pretty mediocre. Service is always great and brisk (can be hit or miss at other restaurants) and, fwiw, I'm Vietnamese..."}
{"text":"Really great pho place! Its a hole in the wall restaurant right off the strip that has amazing pho and spring rolls. I found this place on yelp after an exhausting weekend and this is one totally revived us. We had pho a few days ago inside Treasure lsland and it was horrible, but this was a really authentic place and they had a great variety of soups and noodles. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa has been THE spot to get a delicious bowl of Bun Bo Hue. My family, including my parents, relatives and cousins had all been loyal customers because they had good customer service and flavorful food. 

Starting from their small, hidden gem to their bigger location, we hadn't had any problems since. 

Unfortunately, that has changed. My family and I had recently brought some out-of-state relatives to dine here because we were craving authentic Bun Bo Hue!

Entering as a party of 6, there was one party inside of the restaurant.. meaning a lot of tables were available. First, they had seated us in a tight, claustrophobic corner. As we asked to be seated elsewhere, the owner's husband had placed our menus then rudely pointed out that we could sit at this 8 seater table, BUT said \"you all have to move when people come in.\"  

???????

My parents are people who do not complain if they were to receive a wrong order. However, after this experience, it's unfortunate that Pho Bosa had lost a solid set of loyal customers. 

It is solid if you have delicious, presentable food, but if your customer service does not compensate, it's unfortunate. :-("}
{"text":"Food is ok but the extra charge and hidden charges for service is what upset me. They should tell us before hand! Won't recommend this place to friends or relatives...there are hundreds of Pho restaurants in  town"}
{"text":"Oh my, what a Gem in the rough. First time here with my my family and what great food. Service was excellent. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food at a great price."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sat around 1pm.  The restaurant was packed with happy customers.  I ordered the combinatio pho (#70) and the pork summer rolls to go.  The pho broth is absolutely delicous, hot, authentic and full of the right flavors.  The noodles were cooked perfectly with plenty of meat.  I was concerned because they only offer large.  The size is really a medium  (it's a large bowl with 3/4 full).  
Service was great, friendly and attentive.  The waiter checked in on me twice.  I don't need much attention. 
For a \"medium sized\" pho, it is overpriced (almost $8), but i'd rather pay more for quality and taste.  The pho is as good as what you find in Little Saigon (Westminster, CA).  I will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"Pho is was way below average.  The soup was too sweet and barely salty. The noodles were overcooked.

Bun bo hue was not spicy enough.  

As a Vietnamese person, I am appalled and insulted by the taste of the food here."}
{"text":"Meh.
Second time here, and this time with the family so tried more dishes than last time. Bf's pho tai bo vien literally had three slices of tai in it. The broth was just ok. I had the bun bo hue again, but this time it was less spicy, with less noodles (that were too soft), and no pork blood cubes. Also the beef slices were too hard, but the tendon and pork hock was nice and tender.

We also got two com dishes. The egg rolls are very thin and hardly any filling. The egg quiche is dry and bland. Huge mound of rice though!

I also got my favorite drink, the salted lemonade, but they didn't make it salty. Too sweet. It was $3 for a small foam cup mostly filled with ice.

So for $75 for 6 people and small portions. Also consider that two of the people were 6 and 11 yrs old that hardly eat. The adults ate all the food the kiddos didn't bc there wasn't enough on our dishes to satisfy; even grandma who barely eats was eating off of the kiddo's plate.

Overall, they don't offer anything that I can't make better at home. But this place is def better than Viet Bistro."}
{"text":"Delicious, one of the best pho in town! I recommend to eat the combination pho since it is very delicious. The price is also great, around $8 to $9. Overall, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue was really good and oddly their Korean ribs were amazing.  You wouldn't regret it!"}
{"text":"So aromatic. Best pho in town.  Beats eating o. Strip. Bun bo hue so good too.  They have oxtail and rib but limited supply. Call ahead or first come first serve. Runs out sometimes."}
{"text":"So after not only going second time try the regular Pho had too come back third time check out the broken rice plates. Talk about unreal delicious! I got the scaled down version by one item I believe but the highlight or thing most looking forward too besides the Short RIbs (Kalbi) was the quiche. Now it been while since I had any kind of quiche. Vietnamese restaurant? Who would have thought be without question best little piece of quiche ever had in Vegas. There also was the spring rolls that was not only cooked too perfection, nice crispy on outside till golden brown, and filling hot moist and again delicious on the inside. Not even talking about shredded pork along with couple sliced cucumbers and kind of carrot salad. Soo much going on with all these components on any of the broken rice plates. All that is going on what truly stands OUT is each part could see having whole plate of just by itself!!!!! Talk about filling any one of these broken rice plates sure getting  money worth. I not able too finish all my rice because really the whole bottom of the plate or just about had rice. Me growing up on rice loving every scoop of it!  The Kalbi might not be as meaty as other more local style restaurants but smaller ones feel so much more flavor packed in it. The marinade they do is fabulous! Not too sweet but just the right amount of balance. Broken rice plates see lot more in my future.

The service yet again on top of it. They were even helpful came too my first time ordering broken rice dish explaining too me use the fish sauce over the rice and the shredded pork. I would have never thought of if they never suggested it! It small place but think started up right now never bad time too go. So if never been too Pho Bosa you should give it try. Between the different types of Pho and Broken Rice Plates that all you need!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. Extremely rude staff, they would not accomadate my boyfriend, and the food was okay, not great."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing too special, they didnt have spring rolls with shrimp so that didnt make me happy, the steak pho was ok, best I can say about the place."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I had a seafood pho which also had tofu, and it was pretty good. The pho was served in huge bowl while still piping hot; very filling and great taste. Sorry I can't give more info on the food, but that's all I ate. I had a friendly waiter who was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable and those eating around me seemed to be enjoying their meals too! I would definitely go back! :)"}
{"text":"I dined in once with some friends and this quickly became my new favorite go to spot for pho. The quality and taste were very impressive. Waiter was very nice, but there could absolutely have been some customer service improvements when dealing with the cashier. My experience with the cashier and the fact that they don't offer a small size pho vs just a large are the only reasons preventing me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Coming back here for sure if I'm back in Vegas!! Bun bo hue is perfection. Pho broth is tasty. Ben nuong cuon w the crunchies... Oh man I want it now again!! Just go. It's good hangover food ;)"}
{"text":"Top quality food for a price that won't put your wallet on diet!
In a rather small room-type restaurant, not far from the infamous Strip, Pho Bosa it's somehow part wizard-part mom food server!
Just yesterday I had a nice portion of Gà Nuóng(Grilled chicken), along with some egg rolls, rice and vermicelli noodles.Amazing food, you can clearly differentiate the strong flavors, the portion are very big and the staff is very polite and helpful.The inside decor it's quite raw, but as I realized, many of their customers are coming for the Pho, the perfect remedy for hangovers after a long drinking night, so the surrounding won't be a problem.What I don't like is that the drinks are coming in transparent plastic cups instead of real glass ones, but this minor issue won't make me give them less than 5 stars.
Just remember, you're not going there for a J.Robuchon or Ramsay experience, you're going in there for a 20-30 minutes fulfilling, tasty meal .Just love to see this kind of small businesses around!
Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The decor of the store is lacking, but don't let it discourage you from trying it out.  I've had lots of pho in different major cities, and this one is pretty much right on par.  Not bad, but not great either. The broth was fine, the tendons were super soft (I like mine a bit firmer) and the portion was good.  

 A large bowl for the standard pho with rare beef, brisket, tendons, tripe, and meatballs ran 8.50, which is about right.

This was my first pho experience in Las Vegas so I can't comment on its comparison to its competitors, but I would definitely say it gets the job done although not spectacularly."}
{"text":"This place is located only 1.5 miles from the strip. Pho Bosa just relocated to a larger restaurant over 2-3 times the size of the previous location (if you have been there before). There was ALWAYS a wait at their old location. So this new location is great if you want a quick fix for pho! The pho is good, they give a lot of meat and noodles. However, the broth is average. They only offer large sizes and the pho is approx $8.50 a bowl. 

Also, you can't split the bill. They only allow one card per check~ so plan accordingly if you come with a big group of friends :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the best vietnamese place in town! Just so you know the Veggie Pho is Vegan, the portions are big, the coffee is strong and sweet the the food comes out fast! Also, just wanna say that our server Mo was AMAZING. Please give this place a shot"}
{"text":"Seriously, can we please bring Pho Bosa to the east coast?!! It's everything I wanted and more. 5 stars across the board in all aspects- efficiency, service, quantity, quality, and price. We came during EDC weekend and as you can imagine, it was constantly packed with bodies queued outside the door, heavily hungover and dying for that magical broth to save them. I don't know how they managed it (the store is on the smaller side) but our wait time was only about 20-25 minutes even with large groups ahead of us. We were seated promptly and our orders came out lightning fast. They don't sacrifice quality OR quantity because the portion is huge and delicious!!! And the prices are SO cheap, especially considering we were in Las Vegas. The banh mis were the best I've ever had and filled with so much meat for $6; we actually came back here 3 days in a row to stock up on it. My table also ordered pho thai ($8), bun bo hue ($8.50) and the \"snow\" smoothie with boba ($5). The broth was not overly salty and beef was plentiful. Boba was perfectly chewy and refreshing for the hot day. Every waiter was friendly and I cannot recommend this place enough. Will definitely come back here next year!"}
{"text":"Not of big fan of the location, or the interior, or the pho here.
The pho is Pho-Kim-Long-priced ($10) and just mediocre. After a few spoonfuls I was regretting not choosing to go to a ramen place instead. A pretty bad situation, considering I was actually in the mood for pho when I got here, and their pho convinced me otherwise. And there I was sitting in front of a big bowl of boring pho.

I have to note that the bathroom is in an outside hallway of the adjoining strip mall / office complex. Weird and probably not the safest scenario at night, considering the low-rent industrial area this restaurant is in, just near West of the Las Vegas strip. Think Commercial Center (on Sahara) where Lotus of Siam is, and then imagine having to go outside to use the bathroom. Weird, right?

Broth = meh. Location = ick. Unlikely I'll be back.

But lots of people seem to love it!"}
{"text":"Great place. Was greeted with smiles the minute I walked in, seated almost immediately. Checked on us to make sure our waters and drinks never went empty. The broth to the pho dac biet was great and very flavorful. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. Smells yucky as soon as you get in. Manager guy catches an attitude with customers. We went there and he was asking how many we were. We said roughly 15. And he said if there is more than 15 he will charge extra $50?
Excuse me? What's going on with your restaurant ? We will never come here again"}
{"text":"Best viet place I've been to! As good as some places in Cali. The family that owns it is wonderful. This will definitely be a place I return to each time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty excited to try to place to wrap up my trip to Vegas. I have to say I was a little disappointed. This place is small and looks like a hole-in-the-wall joint that would be very good. The wait is pretty bad if you come with a big party, expect to be separated into two groups. I want to say we waited for around an hour for 7 people. 

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue because apparently that's their signature item. I found it to be bland and they also weren't too generous with the meat. 

On another note, my friend ordered a rice plate and it literally did not come out until almost all of us were done eating. We had to ask them about it twice. Its pretty hard to get the servers attention here since its pretty busy. They did take that order off of our check though."}
{"text":"recommended by friend and said it is one of the best pho he ever had. 

The taste, it is so so, comparing with the Pho here in LA

The service, it is really bad. We asked for a well done meats pho and they gave us a raw meat pho. When we complained, one of their waitress just said it is well done and she used a chopstick put the raw meat to the bottom of pho. And said it is well done in front of us.  I was shock by what her action. Nice job! 

I have also ordered a Vietnamese coffee but it is too sweet and less feel of coffee. 

Overall, don't really trust the rating and what your friend said. Pho is much better here in LA."}
{"text":"One evening we were trying to go eat some ramen noodles but the line was ridiculous and I wasn't tryna wait. We decided on pho instead and turned to Yelp for some nearby places. Pho Bosa popped up and we were sold... They have VEGAN EGG ROLLS!!! LAAAAWD HAVE MERCY I haven't had an egg roll in FOREVER!
Most pho places do offer veggie pho nowadays WITH veggie broth! But this is the first place I've been to that have vegan egg rolls on the menu! And I love them! They're served with the traditional lettuce, pickled veggies, cilantro and rice noodles with their house made sauce. FUCKING YUM. I'm also a huge fan of their tofu spring rolls. They have some crispy crunchies inside the spring roll along with fried tofu and I love the texture it gives the rolls. FUCKING YUM, AGAIN!
The first time we ate here the veggie broth was SUPER on point. I loved it. The following times we have dined here, the broth wasn't quite as flavorful, a little plain actually, but has lots of veggies, bok choy, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and fried tofu. Of course I'd continue coming back here just to get my egg roll and spring roll fix tho. They also have sugar cane juices of you're into that."}
{"text":"The bun bo hue was suuuuper spicy but yummy

The rice plate with Chinese sausage was my favorite!! The quiche was very flavorful and the environment was cute tho almost a hole in the wall"}
{"text":"Let's keep this simple. 

BUN BO HUE or BUN RIEU.

order it.

 YOU'RE WELCOME.

everything here I've tried is pretty yummy.   But those two are my faves."}
{"text":"Cho nay gio lam. Nuoc leo khong ngon gi ca va lai mat tien. $8.25 mot to pho va cho lau lac gan het 30 phut moi co do an."}
{"text":"My VIETNAMESE people please read! So I yelped to find this place and took my family of 5 people. We ordered 1 nem cuon, 1bun rieu, 2 phos and 1 com tam thit nuong. Let me tell you. They're all disappointing, not authentic at all. I then thought to myself these ratings must not be from Vietnamese people. Because we know how our food should taste and what's good and what's not. The pho was not good... All you can taste is the fish sauce. OHHH and FYI if you have a party of 5 or more there is a %15 service charge. My 1st and last time here. Sorry."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy. I heard about this place but never took the time to actually go there since there aren't really any quality vietnamese restaurants in this town, so you can say that I gave up hope. Being half vietnamese myself and having a personal love and affection for vietnamese cuisine this place has rejuvenated my hopes again. My friend suggested this place last night so off we went and I had the Bun Rieu (personal favorite of mine) and holy sh!t was it delicious. As the waitress brought out my bowl I could smell that delicious broth from 10ft away, now that's saying something. Very rich broth and strong aroma, as well as a decent amount of the meat. I have to say that I was genuinely impressed. I will definitely be coming back very soon, probably tonight :) 

On to the other things, prices are reasonable considering how many viet establishments are on spring mountain. Service was suprisingly really good, almost like we were eating at an american restaurant. Usually service in these types of asian restaurants I have found to be horrible or subpar in my past experiences, definitely a plus for me. Restaurant is very clean, which is good. Interior in my opinion is very bland, almost feels like im eating at someones home where they just moved in so there is nothing inside but furniture. Could definitely use more life/flavor and interior decorations. Some viet music playing in the background would also be nice (they have the speakers installed.....) But I understand that this is a new location so maybe they will improve? Regardless of all that this place for me still deserves 5 stars, the most important aspects of food quality, customer service, and cleanliness have been checked off in my book. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Check it out, and maybe i'll see you there!"}
{"text":"This place is the only place for Bun Bo Hue in Las Vegas. The broth is very good.  Their nem nuong isn't bad either but I think Nem Nuong Bistro is a little better. The owner and workers here are very nice."}
{"text":"My friends have been coming to this restaurant for years and have always been telling me to check it out. Well I finally made it and they did not disappoint! I admit I overlooked this place but never again! The drive is worth it! 

First thing that I want to emphasize is the staff! Immediately when I walked in I was greeted with some excitement and appreciation from a lady and gentleman. I'm assuming this is a family owned business as they seem to be running the show. As I sat and looked through the menu I could hear them greet their repeated guest. Always with a smile and excited to be able to serve them again. This is when I realized I'm going to immediately enjoy my experience. When owners genuinely appreciates a new comer the same way they appreciate their regular customers gives me a sense of happiness. This let's me know the business is more than just a building it's a place to build long lasting relationship and memories.

Now let's get down to business! Let's talk about what we came here for which is the Pho! This place provides a huge bowl of Pho! One of the biggest servings here in Las Vegas so if your hungry this will definitely fill your empty stomach! I ordered the Oxtail Pho and boy was my tummy happy! The Oxtail was nice and soft! It was so soft it was falling of the bone! The broth was outstanding! It definitely stood out and differentiated itself from other Pho's I have tried in the valley! 

They serve specialty drinks here such as the cococane which is sugar cane with coconut. This drinks was so good! It was very refreshing and had such an addicting factor that makes you want to keep drinking. It felt like my body was getting all the nutrition needed to get rehydrated! This drink is a must in my opinion. Only place I know that serves it.

By the time I was done eating I looked up and the whole restaurant was packed with people! People having great conversations and enjoying their meal! Love places that makes a person feel that way. I'm 100% going to come back to try more of their other Pho's and their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Long night on the strip and needed a hangover cure. 

Pho Bosa showed up close to where I was and read all the good reviews so decided to drop by and pick something up. 

Didn't dine in but the place is clean and spacious. 

Ordered a large bowl of pho and egg rolls. I took one star off because they don't offer shrimp spring rolls. Instead, they do the pork sausage. 

Service was good. No complaints. 

I'd definitely want to come back again."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Just because it's a small place so it gets pack easily, they don't care for return customers or their services. They don't care for your business."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Vegas, I hit this place up. The last time I was here was 2 years ago in their old location, and now this location is closer to the strip.   Yay.  

The thing I always get is their spring rolls which has the crunchy egg roll shell in it..love the texture and their special sauce.  I don't get this in San Francisco, so it is always a treat to get it here.

We ordered the bun bo hue with mild spice, but damn it was still spicy or me.   The noodles in there was different and loved it..it was not your thin rice noodles but alittle thicker but not like ho fun.  

The reason I come back is the service.  He heard my lips were burning and he brought me a sugar mixture that said it will help bring the heat down.  I mean he didn't have to do it, but that was awesome-ness.  I will always be back."}
{"text":"Authentic pho with great flavors. I was seriously impressed with the broth. Only thing I wished was that they had different size bowls vs just one size because it was a lot of food for me and I don't like wasting food.  All in all delicious food, reasonably priced and great service. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We got the pork spring rolls, bun rieu, and pork chops with vermicelli. The pork spring rolls were the best! Better than Brodard in oc - dare I say?!  The spring rolls were fresh, veggies were cold and the pork and wonton crisp inside were hot which made a great combo. And they came pretty fast!  The bun rieu was delicious with a lot of crab meat. Pork chop vermicelli was okay - nothing special but not bad! Definitely try this place and you must eat the pork spring rolls and bun rieu!"}
{"text":"I dont really do Vietnamese food, considering all the viet restaurants we have here in chinatown. I gave in and went and tried pho bosa, i got to say.... they have THE BEST pork chop broken rice dish.. u have to order it with the shrimp cake...omg, its so good talking about it is making me salivate!! lol MUST TRY!! 
Everyone keeps talking about pho bosa having the best bon bo hue, i tried that also.... it was OK. nothing special or different than other viet restaurants. i must say this place is pretty pricey for viet food, but the rice dish is totally worth it... and their portions are bigger than normal..."}
{"text":"Got straight beef pho with spring roles and it really hit the spot. Cheap, no complaints. worth going off the strip for."}
{"text":"Located near the Chinatown plaza. The interior for was very clean and welcoming. Greeted immediately. Staff was awesome! Very interactive and polite. Hospitality was awesome. I will say the pho was okay. Lacked some flavor and the veggies weren't all fresh. Probably will come back to dine in and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho broth I've had anywhere... and I have a serious pho addiction to the point where I've tried pho in probably 10+ states and maybe 5 countries.

Broth: fragrant, herbal, to the point of medicinal. Yes, I want the flavor to be extremely extremely extremely strong. It's very hot too, some ppl like that.

Meat: good quality steak, generous portions of it. Only minus 1 star because it costs extra to get it raw on the side, like 90% of pho restaurants don't charge extra for it but they do here (+1$)."}
{"text":"Decor or atmosphere was so so but the food and service was FANTASTIC!

Order the Angus beef short rib pho. Such big portions $15, but it was smoky, tender, seasoned well and I couldn't finish it. That had never Ed happened before.

Both the wait staff were attentive and accommodating. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large bowl of pho with rare steak & well done brisket. A very large bowl, lots of noodles and lots of meat. The wait staff was pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"I love this place! Close to Chinatown The Pho rehydrates you. The staff is extremely cordial and helpful. Two kinds of fish sauce for your meal. I had broken rice before and vermicelli is great with BBQ pork. Lots of vegan selections too. Extra meat in the soup is no problem. Go here!"}
{"text":"From the outside appearance it doesn't look like much, then you open the door and there's this wonderful little restaurant! 
We were immediately greeted and handed water, and orders were taken! We ordered the salad rolls with pork sausage, and oh gosh they were wonderful! It came with this homemade peanut sauce that was hot and it was delicious! 
I ordered the traditional pho tai with extra meat, and my friend ordered the spicy beef soup which I think is called bo bun hue, which everyone after us kept ordering! So it must be awesome! I would recommend getting it not too spivey as you can always add spice to the right heat content! It came out a little too spicy even for my spice loving mouth!
Overall the food was really really good and the server was really awesome! From first look this restaurant doesn't look like much but it definitely packs a punch when you go in! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting. I'm not sure what they serve as chicken, but it's definitely NOT chicken. And don't bother coming here if your vegetarian, the pho broth is beef even though the woman will tell you its vegetable. Don't know how this place is still in business.  SKIP THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The smoked brisket bahn mi and brisket and rare steak pho were delicious.  It was so good that we went for lunch two days in a row while we were visiting Vegas for the weekend.  Definitely will visit the next time we are in Vegas again.  The meat was so tender on the sandwich, and the broth was amazing in the pho.  I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for pho."}
{"text":"Super expensive, super tiny Vietnamese restaurant. 

Service wasn't great. When my party of 5 arrived, no one greeted us. When we were escorted to our table, the chairs were all dirty so we had to ask them to clean them before we sat down. It took them a while to come over and clean the chairs before my parents and sister could sit down. 

A local sitting nearby told us the pho wasn't great and that the best thing on the menu was the com tam (broken rice plates). I was feeling bun bo hue, but was told they were out for the holidays. (Highly disappointed because that was the only reason I chose this place!) My sister and I were reduced to ordering $8.50 bun rieu bowls and my hubby and parents ordered $10.99  com tam bowls. We waited 15 minutes for the bun rieu. The bun rieu was super bland, so I asked for shrimp paste. The owner totally ignored my request and we had to ask another waitress to bring it over for us. The com tam didn't appear until another 15 minutes after the bun rieu. However, the local was right. The com tam was pretty good. (Almost comparable with Com Tam Thanh in Santa Ana/Orange County, CA). However, the com tam was missing the bowl of soup that usually comes with this meal. 

To conclude: service sucked, the price was expensive, and the food was not all that good especially for what you were forced to pay."}
{"text":"Not that great. Overpriced for sure. Bun bo hue was awful, beef was hard and stiff, too much onion. Do not come here. They stand here with their iPad prompting you to give minimum of 20% tips."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Best place in Vegas near the strip imo. Try the oxtail pho. Hella bomv"}
{"text":"Pho Bosa's newer, larger & even better restaurant! Congrats on the new location!

Come here for authentic Vietnamese comfort food. Everything is fresh, made from scratch & most importantly made with love! There isn't anything that I don't like here; but if I have to give suggestions, here are my favorites:

I am obsessed with their Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab, tofu & tomato noodle soup) it tastes just like how my mom makes it at home. Hooked up with lots of goodies in a balanced savory broth! I refuse to eat this dish anywhere else (except home.) Noone else compares (except for momma.) Flavor rating: 5/5

You will not eat a better bowl of Bun Bo Hue  (Vietnamese style spicy beef noodle soup) anywhere else in Vegas. Trust me, I've tried several places and keep coming right back (multiple times a week.) It's as authentic as you'll taste at a restaurant. All of the meat in the Bun Bo Hue soup is super tender; they have lots of buttery brisket, huge chunks of flavorful ham hock, even the coagulated pig blood tastes flavorful and fresh (which I don't even typically like to eat, kind of freaks me out at times), and they also include very yummy pork roll sausage loaf too - just to name a few goodies. But that's just the tip of the iceberg; the rich broth is flavored with just the right amount of spiciness, saltiness, sweetness, definitely umami. Oh and the fresh lemongrass stalks infused into the broth just knocks it out of the park! You can really tell someone in the kitchen cares about their cuisine and tastes everything, multiple times. Flavor rating: 5/5

Other items that we can't get enough of are the Nem Nuong Cuon (pork patty spring rolls) - the dipping sauce is key and they have perfected it; it's slightly thick, perfectly sweet, extremely flavorful and addictive. Also the fried egg roll wrapper inside of the spring roll is always a nice surprise and adds such an incredible texture and crunch. You can certainly compare these spring rolls with the world famous Brodard in Orange Country, CA - they are on the same level. Flavor rating: 5/5

I also love their Com Tam (broken rice) dishes - we normally get the combo: Com Tam, Bi, Cha, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (broken rice, shredded pork skin, pork egg quiche, grilled pork, and egg rolls) they also bring out some hot and comforting soup broth to sip with the rice dish. So good!!! We go to town on the plate as everything is so flavorful and freshly prepared. Its more than enough food for us to share, but we get greedy, so we always order something else (Bun Bo Hue) so we can have the best of both worlds. This is the best place that I've had Com Tam in Vegas so far and I've lived here for over half a year now and tried many places. Flavor rating: 5/5

What keeps us coming back - The food! Also the cook/owner Vanessa is so sweet and humble. We love complimenting her often on her food. She is originally from California (Orange County) so she knows what the food scene in \"Bolsa\"/Little Saigon tastes like and the fierce competition out there. She brings her love for food and \"A\" game to Vegas and we are so thankful she did!!

PRO TIP: I also love requesting for their spicy sate sauce and always add a spoonful into all of my food. It kicks everything up few notches in the heat and flavor department and I love a good kick in the pants."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but the oxtail soup was fantastic. Huge oxtail portions were perfectly tender. Took the meat off the bone with a plastic spoon. The broth was a meal in itself. Just perfect. And enough for three people. Also had the clear Vietnamese spring rolls which I don't normally like- these I did. If you like pho I suggest checking this place out."}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE! DEFINITELY NOT FOND OF VEGAS PHO VIETNAMESE PEOPLE. The language barrier deems them uneducated. Id rather be at a mexican restaurant with a bunch of mexicans that dont speak english than in a place like this where they don't understand english. 

THE FOOD WAS GREAT BUT THE SERVICE WAS NASTY! We didnt get refills on our waters, they gave us 7 minutes to look at the menu then PRESSED US FOR ORDERS (6 people? 7 minutes?)---- They almost spilled my pho soup---cause the old lady server kept speaking HER NAILSHOP TALK to the other server.

Then we were MISSING UTENSILS & CHOPSTICKS on the table, they handed us the check HALF WAY before we could even eat half our food cause they were GETTING PACKED and needed tables.

WORD OF THE WISE, SPEAK AND LEARN ENGLISH AND CUSTOMER SERVICE before opening a restaurant. --"}
{"text":"I have been passing by this place for years and never even noticed it until a coworker recommended it. Man I am so thankful because it is the most underrated pho place ever! Yes it's a little small but the food is delicious! 

I came on a rainy day with a friend during my lunch break. Naturally I called ahead since I only had an hour to drive there, eat, and come back and decided to place an order for the bun bo hue. SOOOOO GOOD! I was in heaven, right amount of spicyness with thick yummy noodles and chicken. Not only that but the service was amazing as well. I was only able to try one item but it is definitely on my list to come back to!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better and cheaper pho around LA and the San Gabriel Valley so this was a little disappointing even though I wasn't expecting much from this rest stop on the drive back home to LA. Spring rolls were decent but overpriced. Pho was WAY too salty. I nearly poured a whole cup of hot water into my soup and it was still pretty salty."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. We have to go at least once a week. Kid friendly, reasonable prices and their food is great!"}
{"text":"Typically when you go to a Vietnamese restaurant, once you order, you get your food within minutes. This is the first Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to where I've had to wait 50 minutes to get Pho Tai.

The broth is good. The noodles are still a little hard, they need to be cooked a little longer. The meat is a little tough too."}
{"text":"Excellent! Pho was delicious. My family and I had lunch here while visiting Vegas for a few days. The place was filled with locals and out of towners. We were the only non Asian people there which I think probably says something about the authenticity of the meal and its preparation. We were made to feel comfortable and the service was warm and genuine. At $60 for four people it was easily one of the best meals we had during our stay. I would return again and again. Great family owned business. Vietnam black coffee was awesome too."}
{"text":"West Coast. Viet town. Authenticity. New flavors and more dishes. 

These were all the things I expected from Pho Bosa since all the reviews have been stellar. 

However, I walked in way too hyped up for it. The Bun Hue spicy beef noodle soup wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. It had pork knuckle, corned beef, pork, and a variety of gelatinous meat but it lacked depth and flavor. I should have stuck to Pho. 

The pork sausage roll was ok but I think regular summer rolls are more of my thing. 

The place is good but fell short of expectations. If you level set yourself, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Portions are massive! The soup was super flavourful and price is reasonable. They also have fresh coconut and a 'cafe' with things like grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas if you want Com Tam or Bun Bo Hue. Their meat are cooked very tenderly (I recommend the chicken) and their quiche is my favorite. Their bun bo hue is very spicy so careful, but flavorful. I recommend both those dishes. The pho is okay. Also I found the short Asian lady very kind! She talked to my family about the food (she just has a mean face, don't judge! Haha)"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and was eager to check out this place. The place isn't the fanciest or modern at all it has the classic Vietnamese restaurant vibe. Overall the food was awesome. Ordered the sausage rolls which the server recommended saying it was a popular dish. Along with that got the short ribs and fried egg. Everything was stellar. The taste was there. The portion size was just right too. I loved how the \"sweet fish sauce\" was already in a bottle on the table and you didn't have to ask for more if needed. The menu was confusing and required some instruction. The service was good no issues there. Bathroom was very clean."}
{"text":"How do your run out of food.... Was looking forward to eating over here... But not anymore."}
{"text":"Noodles were great quality, service was decent and the spicy choices were extremely spicy for those that enjoy the spiciest of spicy foods. Coffee however was not he traditional drip coffee that is done in front of you, rather it is served in a cup that is like a fast food cup with coffee that is too sweet. 

Price was slightly high, but fair"}
{"text":"4 stars on yelp but did they buy these reviews or what?

I came here with my girls for a bowl of yummy noodles, or at least I thought that's what I was coming here for. Sigh another one of the few times that yelp has failed me.. TERRIBLY. I want to tell you that it pains me to write this review.  I hate leaving bad reviews for little hole in the wall Asian places, but damn the food here was REALLY really bad.. I should have known a 4 star Vietnamese place would have really been a unicorn (they don't exist).  Most 3.5 star Vietnamese places have BOMB ass good food, and its just the service that sucks. But when you want a fast noodle fix, who cares about service? I don't! Give me a good hot bowl of soup and i'm happy as a clam.

The service was decent, and they were kind enough to let us know a table for our party of 7 would be a few minutes. But They also charged us for gratuity for a party of 7 without letting us know first. You don't even have your own bathroom inside the restaurant, we need to walk outside to use the community bathroom and the door is so ghetto my girlfriend got stuck inside because you need to lift the door to escape that dungeon of a bathroom. Even McDonald's has their own bathrooms inside the restaurant, and they sure don't charge gratuity. Mcdonalds over Pho Bosa? Just something to think about. 

We ordered the pork egg rolls, shrimp rolls and nem rolls. All three appetizers were eh, nem rolls were pretty disappointing but still edible.. on yelp people were ranting and raving about the Bun Bo Hue and the \"home made\" hotsauce so 5/7 of us ordered the Bun Bo hue, One ordered the Bun Rieu, and One Vermicelli noodles.

When the noodles came I was pretty excited. It looked like it had flavor and it would taste good. First sip without adding any sauce. The broth was DISGUSTING!!!! The red color that would give the appearance of flavor and depth in the broth was a SCAM. The red color was achieved by using a CHEATING method. The soup tasted like PAPRIKA and had an under cooked tomato paste sour tangy taste !!! The authentic soup base does not even call for Paprika, OR Tomato paste . Your cooks decided to cut the corners instead of cooking the anatto seed down with oil and shallots and garlic to extract the color and flavors. You want to question me? I cook everything home made, so I sure do know what its supposed to taste like and the actual ingredients in Bun Bo Hue. I sipped one sip of my friends Bun Rieu and same thing, lacking flavor and depth but at least that one was edible. The soup looked so grey and colorless, again, did someone forget anatto seeds? Flavorless soup would have given you no review at all, but when your soup tastes like dry powder, no depth and was so gross, I left the entire bowl there after 3 bites, you have a serious problem on your hands. I DO NOT WASTE FOOD PERIOD. 

\"home made\" hot sauce? HA that's another joke. Bun Bo Hue is supposed to be served with Lemon grass hot sauce , and also have lemon grass in the broth. There was no lemongrass flavor to be found anywhere. Yes I make my own hot sauces at home as well.

Mam ruoc (shrimp paste) was also just room temperature and sitting out on the table. It was stinky as it should be, but the stank came more from it being spoiled and left out too long

Fish sauce - very watered down, no flavor, wheres the garlic and chili peppers that should have been infused with it?

We were winding down our weekend in Vegas, and we didn't want to bother or wait for replacement food. The bill came up to $139, $20 per person including 15% gratuity. Not worth the precious real estate in my tummy, or even a penny.

I never NEVER thought I would say this, but I would rather eat at Pho Kim Long than here. And that place is pretty garbage too lol. The #1 worst viet food in LV goes to Pho Bosa!  Congratulations!  Kinh Do is my favorite for pho/ noodles in LV right now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We were greeted by a friendly server. He was very accommodating and took the time to introduce fish sauce to my friend who never had it. We ordered Pork Spring Rolls, they are like Brodards but BETTER! Fresh and tasty. I ordered their bun rieu. The broth was so savory and it was filled with crab meat. Very delicious. My friends had their vermicelli bowls. They definitely don't skimp out on the meat. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"While Pho Bosa's pho was everything everyone else described here on Yelp (delicious, flavorful, clean broth), what I'm really a fan of was their Pork Sausage Spring Rolls.   About $5 gets you two springs rolls with seemingly the perfect ratio of the pork sausage, greens, and the rest of the filling inside.  Each bite had a nice crisp crunch to it followed by the savoriness of the pork.  I would get this again and again.  

The pho was fine, albeit, there was a desire for more.  I did not notice 'more meat' than other places as some reviews have claimed.  The slices of rare steak  that came in my particular bowl of pho actually over cooked itself by the time it was placed in front of me.  Still not a bad bowl of pho.

The actual restaurant is quite small with only a few tables so I can see it being busy and packed on a weekend.  We arrived early for lunch on a weekday and there was only 2 other customers there.  Sweet!  The service was fine and we never really had to worry about our waters being refilled or flagging the server for the check.  I'd recommend this establishment over Pho Kim Long 10 out of 10 times (because my friends think that iss the best place for pho) and be sure to grab those pork sausage spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Extensive options..especially for gluten free folks. We had #77 and spring rolls with chicken sausage. The soup was savory and amazingly flavorful. Mo rocks this place!! Wish we could take him back to Austin with us."}
{"text":"We got tired from eating Strip food and this was the closest Viet place we could find close to Premium Outlets. The place was a bit hidden but we managed to find it. Food was delicious - ordered normal pho bowl and it was really tasty; portion size was good too. Definitely what I needed on a cold night. It got pretty busy too - no waiting but the place got full. Service was quick and the price was right."}
{"text":"Awesome service! My favorite was the Jasmine rice with Thin beef. Omg amazing!!!  pho was also tasty! Restaurant was clean and big. Lots of parking in front"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic!!! (Thanks Mos?s!) Being vegan and my wife being vegetarian/almost vegan we had lots of questions and they had answers. The spring rolls are the best I have ever had! I honestly never through spring rolls could be that good. 

I was expecting more of a wait b/c of the signs... We weren't there during a rush but we found that the food came out quickly and everything was so fresh when it got to us. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great pho and small location off strip. #73 pho on menu tasted great. Staff was friendly and food service was quick!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! I stop at this place and the food was cold and slow service. Pho soups were really oily and cold. The noodles were hard I asked for a new plate and they made a big deal. Never coming back again"}
{"text":"Came here for the Bun Bo Hue experiences that rumor will be good. Honestly it's not a super good one that I've ever eaten in US (can't compare BBH in Vietnam with US version cause of geography and community plus the source of ingredients). However their Nem Nuong spring rolls version is a hit that need to try, totally a hit version. Location is kinda only convenient if you drive or local residents."}
{"text":"The pho here was delicious and the servers were extremely friendly and helpful.
The noodle soup was amazing and the egg rolls with the side wrap and condiments made it great! 
Will definitely stop by again as we pass through the area."}
{"text":"Best bowl of Vietnamese noodle soup I've had outside of Vietnam or SoCal. Great place."}
{"text":"3 stars for the size of the bowls, tasty Bun Bo Hue ($9), Beef Pho ($8.25) and grilled pork sausage spring rolls ($5.50).  However, there is this one guy (I think he's the owner) with blond hair that kept on walking around staring at customers like he has a chip on this shoulder.  My daughter (she's just 7) and I felt uncomfortable we left 1/2 way through our meal.  

Other than that, the food was great and they have lots of parking.  I'm going to give it another 4 months before I make a trip out to Las Vegas to eat at Pho Bosa again."}
{"text":"Oh their pho is delicious and very flavorful! I had the pho tai and it had so much noodles, i couldn't finish it. The staff is friendly, tons of parking. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so i would reccomend parking your car right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bun bo hue I have ever tried (in a restaurant!). The worst thing in the world is going back to Vegas hoping to get some Pho Bosa, on a Wednesday, and finding out they're closed. If I'm ever back in Sin City, will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I don't understand why we didn't make this our first stop when we drove into Vegas.  Pulling into the place, it really does not look like it's a restaurant and it's surprising it's still around.  But when you walk in, rest assured that this is the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in Vegas.  We had our first Vietnamese meal in one of the hotels on the strip and were sorely disappointed (I'll review their butts later when I remember what it was called).  The Vegas hotel/casino had Filipino fish sauce, unmixed, for the pork chop.  The pork chop was poorly seasoned, and the bean sprouts were BROWN.  WTF.  

But Bosa, omG.  Having driven 10 hours from San Jose, CA to get here, it was a blessing to have it before we went back onto the road to come back.  The food here is as authentic as the Bay Area if not better.  We had pho, bun rieu, and com suon.  The smell, texture, everything was right.  I was jumping for joy because the mints and bean sprouts were FRESH, CRISP.  And we sat there thinking, where the hell do you grow this kind of thing in the middle of a desert?  Beautifully hefty portions of top round, tendon, beef stomach, *drool ....* And they had all the mints - all of them!  Where do you get that here?????

Service is fast, it comes out piping hot, and the coffee is Vietnamese style to the last drop.  And even in Vegas, this place is cheaper than some places in the Bay Area, gladly takes credit card (most hardcore Asian places here don't).  3 of us plus coffee was like $30 after tip - BEAUTIFUL.  Next time we go, we're going here first.  We're picky because we are spoiled from having easy access to good Vietnamese food here.  

I saw a couple of negative reviews about this place - you guys are smoking crack.  This place is authentic, really.  This is coming from a guy who eats in Little Saigon in the Bay and in SoCal."}
{"text":"Friends were craving pho so looked up local pho places and this one came up on yelp and was able to convince my friends in trying it out. Went on a Sunday just before noon and the place was packed. It is a tiny spot and they have signs warning it's not a fast food kind of place meaning don't expect in and out quickly, just in case you're in a rush.  We waited for about 25 minutes so you might as well grab a menu and figure out what you want to order, which is what I did and just chatted up with the staff to figure out how it worked. The broken rice and bun section may seem a little confusing but the staff was able to explain it to me.

 I believe the owner took our order and we were impressed she was able to remember our appetizers, drinks and entrees without writing it down. I ordered pork spring rolls and egg rolls to share. Their spring rolls are very similar to the Brodards with the sauce but was expecting 4 whole rolls not 2 rolls cut into 4 pieces. They were decent though prefer Brodards since Brodards I feel has more ingredients and there's more rolls. The egg rolls were also decent though I would have preferred more herbs and the egg rolls I've had at other places I feel have more meat (due note my standard is Orange County Vietnamese food so it's a bit biased).   

One of my friends got pho, which was huge portion and the other 2 both got different broken rice dishes, which all were big portions and all looked yummy, while I got bun #45, which was also huge and that one comes with grilled pork and egg rolls.  The grilled pork was solid though their style bun seem to have more of a lemon grass flavor to it. Dishes aren't served at the same time and I was the last to receive mines, so the food is hot when you receive so I insisted my friends eat first. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Look... I had 3  ppl tell me best pho spots and none of them knew every Vietnamese person goes here. This place got ranked #1 on our 18 day eating  poll/research project/analysis/extravaganza. I had shrimp rolls and bun Bo hue. If you are not into exotic stuff, just order and don't read what is in it. I promise, if you close your eyes it will make you call your parents and thank them for air you breath. Manager was willing to let us take a nap in the booth because we ate until we were sick! Across the street is a zombie survival adventure to walk of some of the food baby weight. Go here before all other pho spots."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall Pho shop a couple of doors down from Chinatown. It's tucked on a side of a industrial / retail complex just before the 15 freeway. Their two signature dishes is the Crab Pho and Bun Bo Hue. Both are very good. We also had the pork sausage wrap with was excellent. 

Plenty of Parking. Service was OK. All Major credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"It was a sad day when Bosa 1 closed, but I'm glad they're finally back as Pho Bosa. They still have some of the best affordable food in town and portions that will satisfy the hungriest of appetites. The broken rice is like tiny little morsels of heaven. The dishes are as good as I remember with the grilled pork, Korean short ribs, and shrimp cakes being some of my favorites. The bún is just as amazing as the rice. I haven't tried the pho yet but that gives me another reason to come back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.. everything was good except for that pho  broth was foo salty:( I would not go back unless they mAke the broth less salty.."}
{"text":"Fantastic bun rieu- best I've had. The broth was aromatic and the portions of crab/shrimp balls, noodles, and toppings were spot on. Coconut taro snow dessert drink was great, too.

Good service but atrociously ugly but clean dining area gives it 4 stars overall. Come here and enjoy the bun rieu!"}
{"text":"I was glad that I found this place through Yelp.  However, It didn't start well when someone who appears to be the owner greets us but appears grouchy and lets us know it throughout the entire meal.  And this is coming from a person who doesn't expect good service at pho or any other Asian restaurants in general.  

As for the food, it was just okay, nothing to rave about.  Their portions were small and prices were high.  Would I ever return?  Probably not, and on second thought never since there are so many other restaurants nearby that I can try."}
{"text":"I have been a great fan of pho since i came to this country for 24 years.  My family of 11 was in vegas for vacation and we were craving for pho which we all love.  We stopped to this place because of this raving  review and we could not believe of those review.  It is small outdated decor with no customer to start out with.  Pho broth was fine, but the portion was small(noodle and greens are all in small portion), service was below average, and moreover, they charged $1 per onions we ordered which was the first in 24 years(we ordered 5 onions)  we all ended up eating a bowl of pho + extra noodle + extra onion in all extra charge!   I am giving 2 star because the broth was fine.   WE SHALL NOT BE BACK!  be honest yelp.  This cannot be 4 star."}
{"text":"Wow. Definitely a hidden gem off the strip in Vegas! My friends and I woke up Sunday morning craving some Pho. We figured that all the Pho restaurants on the Strip were going to be pretty expensive and not that great, so we ventured off the strip to Chinatown. 

The pho at this restaurant is so cheap, big portions, and super authentic. My friend and I shared a large pho with rare steak and beef balls. I wasn't super hungry so it was just the right size for both of us. The broth was super good and not too oily. I also really liked the beef balls and thought that they had really good flavor. The rare steak was okay, but I don't really order that normally anyway. 

They also had a bunch of flavored teas that looked really good - passionfruit mango with chia seeds, etc. The yelp deal is only good for weekdays so if you come on the weekends it will be regular price! My friend got the number 9 - the flavor was good but a bit too sweet for me. 

(P.S. This place is perfect for curing a hangover the next day)"}
{"text":"My wife is Vietnamese, born in pre-war Saigon.  In 2015, we spent the entire month of April touring Vietnam.  When we returned to Las Vegas, we told everyone that Vietnamese food in Las Vegas is better than Vietnamese food in Viet Nam.  [This is not the proper forum to go into why this is so!]  But this is not true of Pho Bosa.  

When Pho Bosa first opened on Polaris Ave, we went to try it out. We were both dissatisfied with the quality & taste of our meals, and the service was terrible.  After Pho Bosa moved to West Twain, my wife said, let's give them another try.  The food and the service were just as bad as when they were located on Polaris."}
{"text":"The pho broth was delicious. Very rich in flavor. Our party of 10, loves everything here. We got a thit nuong banh mi which tasted delicious. The pho dac biet was so much meat. I have never had to take meat out before but this reminded me of meat levels in California. Prices are fair for pho, about $9. Rice dishes are a bit higher $11-13. I was surprised they didn't offer more dessert variety. The day we went was super packed and I could hardly get simple things I needed like bowls for my kids or scissors to cut noodles or a to go box. I would give it 5 stars had it not been for the lackluster service. I would certainly visit again though!"}
{"text":"Pho Bosa is definitely a local treasure when it comes to home-style Vietnamese grub.  I reviewed this humble eatery based on the merits of their Bun Bo Hue back in their old location (Bosa 1) and since their move have had the opportunity to sample additional selections including Bun Rieu and their broken rice plates, and have never been disappointed.  

Bun Bo Hue- rustic and spicy lemongrass beef broth with chewy round bucatini-like rice noodles and a complex assortment of flavors and textures from the plethora of meat components (beef shank, pork knuckle, beef tendon, ginger infused pork blood cake) topped with an array of crunchy shredded cabbage and fresh herbs), no mouthful is the same from start to finish.  Definitely the best rendition in town.   

Bun Rieu- an umami tsunami of chicken broth with thin rice vermicelli, fried tofu, fresh tomato, and a mixture of crabmeat /egg topped with crispy shallots, green onion.  Served piping hot, this is an optimal winter dish with a lot of minimally \"masticatory\" (for lack of a better made-up word) components meant to be swirled together on the tongue with interplay of sweet, savory, and even floral (there is some mystery herb in this soup that is reminiscent of shiso leaf).

Broken rice plates- It may sound like the aftermath of a Greek wedding, but these are the Vietnamese cousins of the American meat and 3 sides.  The rice are fractured grains broken during the cleaning/harvesting of the rice, originally considered peasant food, but now having a wave of popularity due to its unique texture and flavor evoking the nuttiness of basmati and the butteriness of arborio in a solid risotto.   Accompanying the rice is a savory shrimp cake wrapped in impossibly crispy tofu skin, a delicate egg quiche, shredded pork loin, some pickled veggies and your protein of choice (I recommend the Korean beef short ribs or the grilled pork chop).  Drizzle all the above with their fish sauce made in house, and you will not want to stop eating until the last grain of rice is scooped off the plate.  

Don't forget to partake in the free fountain drink with checking in on Yelp and credit cards are accepted!"}
{"text":"Costumer service at Pho Bosa was excellent. Food was also delicious. The waitress took my wife's order and was very patient with her. Got her order right the first time. 5 star rating all the way!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. The food and service was great.  We had pho, dry noodles and Bun Bo hue.  We all loved it!  Can't wait till will come again to Vegas.  It is a must stop."}
{"text":"Great quality food and exceptional service!

Had the nem nuong spring rolls, bun rieu, and pho dac biet, and all were delicious! Big portions!"}
{"text":"Suprisingly one of the best meals I had on my trip. Pho is great hangover food and we were looking for exactly that. We arrived a little after noon on a Sunday and it was relatively empty but filled up quickly while we were there. Everything was great and service was quick. The pho was a little salty for my taste but no one else seemed to mind. They only have a large size for the combination pho and gave an ample amount of meat and noodles. None of us could finish our bowls. They also offer a variety of drinks--I liked the coconut and sugarcane juice. They also have fresh coconuts, if you're into that. No frills but good food."}
{"text":"I normally eat Pho. And when I'm in Vegas. I always make a stop here. When it's busy, service can be a bit slow. But it's worth it. Have patients and look at your phone. Like you normally do."}
{"text":"I had a chance trying this place yesterday on my vacation Their Bun Rieu Cua was so delicious The price is decent It will be my first recommendation for Vietnamese food here in LA Love the taste so much and I would love to go back to try Com Tam My husband for Bun Bo Hue and he loved it too since he is a Bun bo Hue lover so far this is the better Bun Bo Hue for him comparing with any other places that he had tried Love it"}
{"text":"Looked for Pho places around my job and this little gem came up. Soooo thankful to find this place.. First off there was no line like the other pho places and it was decently priced. 

I ordered #73 which was brisket and need balls and I have to say this place is number 1 so far here in Las Vegas. I loved the soup and the noodles. Everything was so fresh and super clean. They give you tons of napkins and the cold water with lemon keels flowing instead of waiting 10-15 min for another fill up. I just hope one day this establishment will stay opener later. 

Also for checking in they have a $2.99 coupon for a dessert and it's for a limited time only. I didn't get a chance to use it but next time I will if they still have the offer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The broth in the pho was so flavorful! And their Korean short ribs omg SOOO good. Will definitely come back again soon"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning after eating here. I meet the toilet a lot afterward. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Went there after seeing the good reviews. Enjoyed the food. The owner and staff were very nice except for the Asian lady (there were 2 of them at that time;it was the one with straight long hair). She came up to our table several times to get our orders and bring our food. We all noticed that she was giving us an attitude. Had her eyebrow raised at all times whenever she faced us but she was good with other customers. We couldn't understand why she would be rude towards us. It was from beginning to end. When we were ready to pay the bill, we were going to pay with both cash and credit card. She said they don't \"split checks\" and so we couldn't pay that way. We told her we weren't asking for split checks and we understood that they charge for gratuity for large parties. But she just said NO. Right before leaving, my friend asks for a bag and she drops it on the counter. My friend (by this time,she's had enough of this lady's rudeness) asked if she was ok. Asian lady said she was tired and so my friend said she should go home as she thinks it's not good that she's putting it on customers who are there to eat. It's not like they are serving people for free either. Asian lady then throws her pen and pad on the desk and starts cussing at my friend, IN FRONT OF OUR KIDS- infant, 1, 3, 5 and 6 year olds. It was a shocking experience for all of us and traumatic for the kids. We're still trying to figure out what the hell her problem was with our families. She's definitely bringing bad vibes to their business. Food was good though.

*originally gave 1 star, but the rest of the staff were nice and friendly and we enjoyed their food. One falling star for the rude lady."}
{"text":"This is the 4th day of our trip and we were all dying for some asian. We found this though yelp and their beef soup base and meat quality are really good."}
{"text":"I've been to pho bosa since days they still located on jones blvd. If you looking for bun bo hue(spicy beef noodle) this is the place to go! Hands down the best. Generous portion, good flavor, good spice, fresh veggies, and piping hot broth! What else could we ask for? And service is so nice. The owner and staff are very welcoming. And If you craving pho or rice dishes? Don't hesitate to stop by here as well!"}
{"text":"Pho Bosa was there for me after Vegas. When you 'accomplish' (that word can be used loosely in this context) 2 clubs and a day club within 48 hours, pho is necessary for recovery. Yes, even if it's 115 degrees out. 

Service was friendly and our pho was out pretty quickly. 

The portion size of the combo was seriously large. The broth was soothing and calmed my need to vomit slash the throbbing in my head. But the husband and his more informed palette reports the broth was on the sweet side. So forgive me if the four stars were given based more on the positive experience than true authenticity. 

With so many pho spots just on Spring Mountain Road alone, I seem to never find my way back to the same one. I'll try to keep this one in mind for the future."}
{"text":"The Bun Bo Hue is tasty I love it! I was only passing by on my home to Utah and wanted some Nem Nuong but also got the Bu Bo Hue. The most tastiest I have had. I have had a lot in Utah and California so I'm surprised I found such a tasty one:)"}
{"text":"When you're sick of the buffets and need a good bowl of Pho, go here!  We had the smoked Oxtail Pho and it was amazing!  Staff is very friendly and you can't go wrong with some home style Vietnamese cooking!"}
{"text":"Amazing grilled pork. We would have easily driven by this place if not for the great Yelp reviews. This is \"off the beaten track\" and located in a desolate shopping center near Chinatown. Although service is slow (we were told by the owner's brother that the location previously was home to a small sandwich shop so the kitchen grill is very small), the vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled pork and pork egg roll was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese place near the strip. The pho was phabulous! The service was personable and attentive. Don't miss the salad rolls with pork sausage what a delight. Also a terrific value with good prices and large portions. Don't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food:
Bun rieu was probably one of my favorite, ever and I am quite picky with my bun rieu. Their broth isn't drench with too much oil and they aren't stingy with their amount of meats in the soup (crab, shrimp), you can also just go rest. I also got the tofu spring which was also one of my favorite. 

Service: the service wasn't the greatest, waited about 30 mins for our table. 

If I am in the LV area will def. stop by again. Delicious"}
{"text":"The food here is great, but what is even better is the service! The waiter nicely explained us how to eat each different thing and mix sauces and what to do. It was like having a native of a cuisine show you the ropes.

I was here with a group and we got and shared many dishes. For appetizer we got a fried shrimp dish. I wish I could tell you the name but the online menu is down and quite frankly I don't remember. It was really delicious. We were able to make a sauce to dip it in and they had the sauce and peppers and seasoning so you could make your sauce as hot or mild as you liked it. You can use this same sauce on rice when your rice dish arrives.

The Bun bo hue was great and the entree I got \"broken rice with chinese sausage\" was good as well. Only thing to mention though is the portions are VERY generous. We ended up stuffed beyond belief and I felt bad that we had to essentially trash a lot of really good food. 

Only thing that is kinda weird about this place is the bathroom is OUTSIDE the restaurant lol. You have to walk out the back and go down an outdoor hallway to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"The wait time was too long! There was a wait to get a table and then a wait to get the food after we ordered.  

The food wasn't that great either.  The bun bo hue broth was so salty.  I had to add two lemons to it and it was still salty. 

Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"LV is king of the izakaya compared to where I live, but if this is what LV has to offer for Vietnamese food, Houston- and even Oklahoma City- still out-reign Sin City in the world of little Saigons.

Food here isn't bad by any means.. it just missed the mark by a little bit for everything.

Pho Dac Biet comes in one size- large. I can't eat a large, and I've never been to a legit Vietnamese place that doesn't give you the option. Pho Dac Biet also does not have tripe in it, and their actual pho menu is quite small.

Speaking of me being salty already, the broth was so salty that I couldn't convince myself to continue eating my pho since it was borderline unenjoyable. I told the older gentleman working, and like all great chefs, he didn't seem very appreciative of my criticism. If you are trapped in the same situation, make sure you ask for a side of hot water to go with it.

Fried egg rolls were good but nothing spectacular. Their filling includes a lot of vegetable, and I like meat and Asian mushroom fillings for my Vietnamese egg rolls.

Bonus points: $4 for a whole coconut. That was my favorite part. Get you a dang coconut."}
{"text":"I took my family here on our last nite in Vegas because we all wanted to eat good pho soup.  I'm glad we try this place. Their soup is really yummy. Even my daughter enjoyed her meatballs pho noodle. The only thing that's lacking, they don't have no egg noodle . It's alright, we will be coming here again if I'm back in Vegas and will order other menu."}
{"text":"We live in Dallas and were at Pho Bosa last summer while we were in Las Vegas for a week.  It was so good we came back before we left.  
The pork rolls were amazing, the pho was insanely delicious.  The people are friendly and warm.  Lots of people there.  Lots of families and couples.  The little location is quaint and kind of groovy.  Not far from the strip.

This is an excellent restaurant.  We will be coming back in August 2015."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! The noodles were the perfect chewy and the broth delicious. Lots of meat too! I eat pho all over the US and this was the best so far!!  Not a fancy place and location weird  hence 4 stars"}
{"text":"Vegetarians rejoice! Truly veggie Pho that tastes great! We have been to 7 places in Vegas for Pho and this is the best yet. We got steamed tofu added. It will come fried if you add tofu so request steamed if that's what you want. So delicious. Our server, Moses, was a delightful man (I would hire him in a minute), and everyone else who stopped by our table was genuinely friendly. Absolutely generous portions of veggies (in fact, I'm going to say it- the best I've had yet). We also had veggie Spring Rolls that came with a different sauce but it was terrific. Apparently they are also re-doing the menu and adding even more vegetarian options. The only thing we felt was a little strange was the decor, and that cleaning supplies were out. The decor was awkward with signs promoting health products that had nothing to do with food. That said, just ignore it. I've been to Asia and had my best meals sitting on sticky children's school stools in back alleys. Think Diner's Drive-ins and Dives! I AM a designer so it made me a little berserk, I wanted to Re-do everything because the food is so damn good I don't want people to dismiss it or leave less than 5 stars because of atmosphere. It was super clean and delicious. If you want great Pho in Vegas, this place should be top on your list. If you're a vegetarian, it's the only one we have found where they totally got it that we didn't want veggies in beef broth."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them at least a 3.5 stars but it's not an option so 3 stars for now. I was in to try a new pho place but decided to order Bun Bo Hue. It's not the best broth, however, the meats melt in your mouth. I heard their pho was amazing per hubby.  I've also ordered pork spring rolls and egg rolls. The spring rolls were amazing.

The atmosphere was friendly. I will definitely give it another try on my next visit and it will be their pho."}
{"text":"Nevada itself just don't have good pho. My pho was super plain!! Even if I added fish sauce, sriracha, hoisin, it just didn't spice up the flavor. $9 for a large bowl and that is the ONLY size they have. Like really, there is no other options... I mean I understand that there is people who is hung over and need pho to be revived but having a medium bowl as an option would be nice. Customer service here is really rude. It took them 15 minutes to take our orders when there was nobody in the restaurant except for a group of 4 that already had their food served to them. I ordered the pho with rare steak, tendon and brisket, I hate eating my rare steak cook so I usually get it on the side. I asked the server who seemed to be the owner if I can get my rare steak on the side, she said $1 extra. I was like wth, a dollar extra for less work of you throwing the rare steak that already came with the bowl to put it on the side? how friggin ridiculous right? I would never come back to this pho shop. Seriously, the 4 stars on yelp is half ass and bullshit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far, hands down, THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever received from a Vietnamese restaurant. Our server asked if it was our first time there (which it was) and explained the full menu to us. He was very knowledgeable and gave some on point recommendations.

We ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien which is pho with rare steak and beef balls. Delicious as expected. I also tried Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle) which definitely hit the spot for me! I highly recommend it for first timers! Don't forget to try their shrimp cake! Everything came out fresh and with great service, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a few years now and will always come here for my Pho cravings! The restaurant is very intimate and quiet. Because of the size there aren't a lot of employees there so you will usually see the same servers, which is nice because they remember you and what you order. Everything I order here is great! From their Thai Tea, Spring Rolls, to all of their Pho options. The servers will educate you on what to put in your choice of Pho and which seasonings will enhance specific tastes. I have been here when it's super slow to super busy and you usually get seated right away. What is nice is that there is a bar right next door so this could be a date spot. You could eat at Pho Bosa then hit next door for some beer or live music."}
{"text":"I wanted to try some place new besides Viet Noodle Bar which is my go to for bun bo hue. Did a quick search for bun bo hue and Pho Bosa popped up with great reviews. Did a quick skim and a lot of people did recommend it.

Its pretty close to chinatown with a large lot. I came around 3:30 with a gf and we both ordered the Bun Bo Hue. The server asked us how spicy we wanted it and I got mild while my friend got spicy. It came out fairly quickly, in a huge bowl and accompanied by a large plate of fresh veggies. As soon as I tasted the broth I was disappointed. It was definitely lacking flavor. Maybe I came in on an off day or something but the bun bo hue at Viet Noodle Bar is 100x's better and its consistent too. Lots of meat but its really tough and the cuts are super thick. Another reviewer mentioned that the pork blood had a weird taste to it, and I thought so too. 

Food was meh but service was really good. I might be back to try their bun rieu since I\"m down the street, but we'll see!"}
{"text":"Oh man! I haven't had Pho Bosa for over seven years since their first location at Spring Mountain and Jones. Ever since they kept moving around Chinatown, I stopped eating there. Well, today me and my cousin came back since it was so good back in the days and it still is!

We came in on Thursday, October 19, 2017 around 1 p.m. for lunch. We ordered:
- Grilled Pork with Shrimp Cake and Egg Quiche
- Grilled Pork Chop with Shrimp Cake, Egg Quiche, and Shredded Pork Skin

Omm Omm Omm... So good... The taste was so delicious and mouthwatering, even writing this review and looking at the photo is making my taste buds wanting more! By far, this Vietnamese restaurant has the BEST rice dishes! The flavor of the grilled pork has lots of flavors especially the shrimp cake and egg quiche. It tasted so fresh and rich in flavors! They gave lots of portion. I was even able to finish my dish!

The staff here are nice and wanting to make sure their food satisfy their customers. Also, the service here was good.

I RECOMMEND TO COME EAT HERE! By far from any other Vietnamese restaurant, this place is the best in Vegas! I give this place two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best pho and best Vietnamese food in Vegas, there is no close second,

Service is excellent and prompt, don't let the humble exterior and interior deter you, the food is top notch, very clean and organize.

I might dare to say, perhaps the best pho and vietnamese food in America, keep in mind I am from Cali and have had Vietnamese food from Vietnam and all over the west coast. 

Martha Stewart has even been here....

I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is still my first stop in Vegas for food (if I have a rental car). I stopped eating most meat except for seafood and they make a fantastic vegetarian pho consisting of friend tofu, broccoli, and bok choy. Also, try their tofu spring roll - their rolls are interesting because they add a crispy wonton to the center and it's delicious. 

I've also noticed that the service has been amazing every single time. Plus, never a wait!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall and may look a little scary when you pull up, but the Pho is DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"They got COCOCANE this weekend!!! When Fresh SugarCane meets Fresh Coconut.. They get married and become, COCOCANE!!!!!"}
{"text":"We are 3 Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas and this is the best one. It is a little harder to find because it's not on the Main Street of Chinatown. But overall the food was delicious. The Bun Bo Hue was super good! The pho is also good along with the pork patty and summer roll. Very flavorful and great seasoning. Not too sweet or not too salty! Prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa is a hole in the wall type authentic Vietnamese restaurant, which is exactly what we were looking for.  You could tell they don't get many tourists here because they asked if it was our first time, offered to wrap up our leftovers, and said \"see you next time!\" as we left.  This made me like this place immediately.  Overpriced tourist traps (the opposite of Pho Bosa) were exactly what we were trying to avoid.

I've been to Vietnam and it has my favorite food anywhere in the world, and prices about 1/20th of what you'll pay at any hole in the wall in the US, so it's hard for me to give anywhere 5 stars.  I also have to dock some points because the reason we chose Pho Bosa was for the wrap it yourself spring roll platter and they didn't have it available.  But the food that we did have was delicious..

We ordered the:
Vietnamese Salad Noodle Bowl with Chicken Sausage
Chicken Sausage Vietnamese Spring Roll
Tofu Vietnamese Spring Roll
Vermicilli Shrimp Crab Soup

If I lived in Las Vegas I would be here all the time.

Note that the restroom facilities aren't the best.. they are outside the restaurant and not the most hygienic.. but hey, it's a hole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I forgot my sunglasses and the server chased after our car to return it."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and have had my fair share of good ones. We used to go to a different place but this place by far exceeds anyone that we've been to in Vegas. The broth they use is so good and doesn't really need sauce, except if you need more spice. The broken rice is so yummy, the meat is very well marinated. The vermicelli bowls are to die for. Pretty much every time I come in here, they never disappoint. The service is great as well and they are very friendly. The location is a little weird and the place is small, but is closer to the strip than the other places so that's great news for tourists. They will be opening another location soon that will be a lot bigger than this one, so that solves any claustrophobic issues you may have with this location. This is definitely the best Vietnamese place here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really have no idea why this store will have many star -.- It more expansive than other Vietnamese restaurant. The food looks not bad but Nothing special to me -.-  

When I just opened up the menu to look up the food, n the lady just keep on tacking us many times, are we ready to order or not. What?! If I'm ready, I'll raise up my hand to find u lol 

Somehow I just felt I was forced to order without go through anything from the menu to my brain what should I order -.-"}
{"text":"I came back today with a fellow foodie. We had to wait about 5 minutes. It was well worth the wait. We had the pork spring rolls. Very good, it's the  crunch that makes them so unique. The spicy beef was awesome as it was last time.  The beef is so tender and flavorful it is amazing. My friend had the vegetarian and was very pleased with the outcome.  The place was slammed and they still took time to talk to us. 
 I just went to the new location located in a strip mall on Valley View.  They seat a lot more now.  I had the spicy beef Pho and it was scrumptious and the fried pork rolls were awesome, especially after the chef showed me how to wrap them with lettuce, noodles and condiments.  This place is destined to be a local hit."}
{"text":"We weren't interested in the expensive buffets on the strip. My daughter suggested pho.  Thank goodness for Yelp or we would never have found this jewel!  We got there early and were concerned that the place was empty.  Glad we arrived early because when we were done, the place was packed.  The food was fantastic and the prices were so much more reasonable than anything on the strip. Try #11 with the grilled pork loin and noodle bowl. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Pho is not good. The broth is salty and heavy smell. However, nem nuong and bun bo Hue is the best. Their service is good too."}
{"text":"pho bosa probably isn't a very good place to come if you're hungover and are hungry as hell.  their signs explain that they are not fast-food, and it can take a while for you to get served.  indeed, it was so.

to be honest, i think they could use hiring a couple more people as it seemed to be just one lady and one guy taking orders and cleaning tables.  

with that said, pho bosa is still quite delicious.  their soups have a more homemade taste to them (i.e. not over dunked in MSG).  the pho broth tasted clean and refreshing.  the tendon was quite good as well.

the bun bo hue was packed with meat.  in fact, i don't think i've ever seen this many pieces of meat in a bun bo hue.  pork blood, and pig knuckles (yep thats feet people!).   

be prepared to wait for a seat, and then to wait another while for food to come.  order some spring rolls or nem nuong"}
{"text":"Delicious spring rolls, sugar cane juice, and rice entrees, but I found my pho broth to be on the salty side. Couldn't bring myself to finish it."}
{"text":"Solid place to get pho, which, for those who don't know is rated \"BEST CURE FOR A HANGOVER\" since FOREVER!! If anyone knows what I mean lemme get a HOLLAAAAAAAA~

We came on the last day of my friend's wedding celebrations a couple weeks ago. There were a total of 8 of us and we were totally accommodated right when we got there (around 11am). The staff instantly gave us water and offered us more drinks (which I ALWAYYSSS love). I took advantage of some fresh coconut and some of the others got che ba mau (a 3 bean dessert drink) and some other stuff. THE COCONUT WAS SERVED OUT OF AN ACTUAL YOUNG COCONUT xoxoxoxo

As he was grabbing drinks, the staff also started to ask if we were ready for food. Most of us were starviiiiing, so we ordered right away! I was able to grab the bun bo hue (similar to pho but spicy and with pork's blood) which I think was a solid dish. I've had it multiple times, and have seen it go wrong with the noodles too soggy or the broth too spicy, etc. This one, however was great. Perfectly done noodles and delicious soup and pork's blood. 

Great find!! Come here if you feel all GOOOOOOOPY from the night before's activities!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Las Vegas local but if I was, I would not be returning to Pho Bosa. On my way into town we stopped in for two bowls of veggie pho. The service was great, the restaurant is large and mostly empty at the time we went in. However, the vegan veggie pho that all the other yelpers are giving such great reviews on was not very good. The broth was very salty and oily, and to my husband and I, it tasted like chicken broth. The vegetables in the soup were not the freshest, we had brown spots on the carrots, black spots on the bok choy and the mushrooms had an awful texture. There were 5 pieces of tofu in my soup, and after eating one I left the others in the bowl. Also the noodles were all clumped together and even though we let them sit in the hot broth for over ten minutes, they just got more gluey. 
We paid and left without finishing our bowls. 
The plus side was they brought out a huge plate of bean sprouts with lots of basil, and also gave us forks and napkins without us having to ask. 
Next time though, I'll pass on this one."}
{"text":"Pho wasn't that great compared to other places I have visited.  Couldn't believe they charge for onions which other many places provide free."}
{"text":"Top notch Bun Bo Hue in Las Vegas. I noticed that the other pho restaurants in town didn't even appear to offer BBH. Pork sausage springs rolls were l delicious too, with a crispy wonton spine and an awesome \"14 ingredient\" peanut sauce that was lighter and sweeter than your typical dark brown peanut sauce. Credit/Debit cards accepted. No beer, wine or alcohol served."}
{"text":"Dined in twice.. the food was good. Great portion.. but my main issue was the cleanliness... the tables are so sticky... I just found it to be something I can't ignore... with so many different options around I don't think I'll give it a third shot"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update. This place is still pretty awesome. They've added more drinks to their menu but the food is just as good. Last week I found myself craving their food when I was in Vegas. I picked this place over Vegas buffets! There's nothing like a good bowl of soup noodles to warm you right up."}
{"text":"So a good friend of mine and I decided to get some hot soup on a cold day!!!  BBRRR!!!

Found this wonderful hole in the wall gem!  We couldn't believe how great it was!  It was packed at 2pm on a Monday...we had the pork sausage spring roll. It blew us away in both flavor and texture.  The spicy beef soup was beyond delicious.  Well balanced, rich and hearty. The pork blood added a creamy texture and the tendons were tender and flavorful.  

I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of pho but this place is pretty damn good. When I saw the photo of this place I was thinking it looked pretty shady. But since it had 4 stars I decided to give it a shot. We had to wait because all the tables were full and I have to say it was worth it. As I was eating, I thought, \"Dang, these noodles are not too shabby,\" when my brother, who happens to be a Viet food enthusiast, says, \"This place is good!\" Next time I'm in Vegas and someone wants pho, I'm gonna make sure we go to Pho Bosa."}
{"text":"Best pho restaurant in the Las Vegas area, hands down. Believe it! I've tried plenty before settling here. Now I stop by at least once per trip, and you know I'm there quite often. No Westminster prices, but we're in Vegas after all. Great staff. High quality food. They're not too far off the strip, but just far enough that it's not hectic. Only down side is their dac biet doesn't have everything it should!"}
{"text":"This place I give 0 star=( tell us to right our name on clipboard( sit n wait)which they have 3 table ready....later tell us that let us sitbut won't get to us until 10 min...not a great service....plus I saw the lady roll spring w/ no gloves on..dirty..."}
{"text":"Love the pho and all other dishes here. We hit this place at least once week. Their spring rolls with the fried wontons inside are to die for!"}
{"text":"It was disappointing only given the reviews and ratings advertised on this place.  We ordered the Pho and Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup), and the broth was a little bland.  For health reasons, it's probably best this way (less msg?).  But I don't eat for heath reasons, so I'd rather it be flavorful with a kick.  

The staff was very friendly and approachable, but not attentive.  Given the number of customers present during our dining time, I would expect them to check on us at least once.

I'll go back and stick with the other 2 establishments we usually frequent.  Out of respect, won't mention the names on here."}
{"text":"maybe i've been spoiled by all the viet food that i've been eating since moving to OC, but i just don't think pho bosa is all that.

the pho was small and overpriced.  place is super grimey, even for vietnamese restaurant standards.  noodles were overcooked and the broth tasted more like msg water that lacked real hearty bone marrow flavor.

only thing pho bosa has going for it are the nem nuong.  pretty good for vegas but the day i went, they were out of their house sauce so we had to use fish sauce instead."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Pho Bosa. I have heard a lot about this place from my friends specially about their Bun Bo Hue. It was so good. I haven't eaten a good hot spicy beef soup ( bun bo hue) in vegas. The broth is perfect, not too oily or salty. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Im shocked at how many positive reviews this place has received. If I could give 0 stars, I really, really would, Before you decide to come here based of the good reviews this place has received take a moment to read this one. I've been to many pho places and I have never been more disappointed by pho than I was here. Since it is in Las Vegas, I didn't expect the pho to be extraordinary, but I also didn't think it would be a complete bust. Sadly, it was the latter. Save yourself some time and do not come here. 

First off, the food itself. it takes \"10-20 minutes\" for your pho to come out ( I ordered #70 combination) according to a lengthy sign that gives a sad excuse for their slow service. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, believing that the time was lengthy to ensure quality. When the food arrived, I was horrified. The bowl looked plain and and somewhat incomplete. Here was the breakdown of what I got: 

The broth - decent, hardly any flavor
Noodles- tasted as though they just came out of an instant packet. They were not chewy and tasted stale. 
Meat- unlike most places, Bosa gives you suspicious looking meat that tastes as though it has been sitting in the pot for a little too long. There also wasn't much meat either.
Onions- you want more of it? Here's an extra $1 charge. No thank you. 


Next complaint is the service. Our waitress came to our table with little professionalism and an irritated look on her face. She took 10 minutes to bring out our water and forgets the soda. One of my friends notices that the sriracha looked a little off color so she checks the bottle. It had expired in APRIL, and we were eating end of June. She took it to the front desk and the man merely apologizes and adds that all the sriracha comes from the same box. I'm baffled by this statement, as if it was supposed to make us feel any better. Not only was out sriracha expired, everyone else's in the restaurant was too. If this restaurant believes it is okay to be cutty about its regulations and attempt to serve customers expired sauce, your best bet is they they are doing some other shady things in the kitchen. 

Lastly, some other important things I've noticed:

1. Bowls only come in one size, which they consider a 'large' but really comes out with regular sized potions.
2. You cannot split the bill.
3. Automatic gratuity for larger parties. I know many places do this, but my guess is they do this to squeeze every last drop out of you.
4. The lengthy sign about not being a 'fast food' restaurant. Sorry, but slapping a nonsensical sign on the wall as an excuse for slow service doesn't cut it. Pho is always fast, and if it isn't, it better wow my taste buds. The sign also notes that your wait time could DOUBLE if the restaurant is busy. That's 20-40 minutes waiting in a small cramped restaurant with no more than 10 tables. What a sad excuse to avoid hungry impatient customers. 

I hope that my lengthy and detailed review has convinced you to search elsewhere to satisfy your pho cravings. Don't be disappointed the way I was. If you love pho as much as I do, STAY CLEAR!!"}
{"text":"the broth is always a liitle different at each PHO place you go. This was better than most with plenty of green onions and salantro, The meat was very good and thinly cut. Also their spring rolls had this yummy sausage with a crunch. Very unique and amazing. P.S. if you're looking for a good panini definitely try this place. I had the Boso special.  
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Pho Bosa isn't far from the strip. We were afraid that since it wasn't on Spring Mountain, where the rest of LV Chinatown is, it may be a sketchy. So we didn't have any expectations. 

We walked in and was greeted immediately by a gentleman, smiling and showing us to our seats. He brought out the menu and asked for our drink orders right way. He recommended the Vietnamese iced Coffee but we passed on it. 

The pho broth is probably the better if not the best in the Las Vegas area but then again, I've only had pho at 4 other places in LV. Plenty of meat and veggies. I didn't have to use a lot of condiments. 

Our waitor gave us a sample of the iced coffee and my, my, it IS the best Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had. I ordered one for my Mom and I. She said it was too bitter but changed her mind later after she mixed it and it got a bit watered down.

Spring rolls were on point. The dumplings were amazing. They only had another couple in the establishment so we only waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. Our waitor was attentive and super friendly. There were plenty of seating and they were playing \"Kung Fu Panda\", awesome! 

One regret was I should have ordered a second iced coffee. It was well balanced of sweet and bitter. It kept me up. My parents and husband agree this will be our go to Pho Restaurant when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"their bun bo hue is to die for! it was such a big portion and i wasn't able to finish all of it.

we ordered egg rolls as well, but i was confused because the nuoc mam (fish sauce) was in a bottle? and it didn't look like it had chili paste, sugar, etc mixed in so i didn't use it. 

will definitely come back next time i'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"Outside
A little daunting from the outside. All of the windows are covered with a black cloth and they have a flashing light that makes you wary it might be a strip club. However, the food is mostly delicious. 

PHO
The bowls of pho are huge and well flavored. Though $9 a bowl, there's more than enough meat to make up for the price. I counted 6-7 pieces of tendon on top of 10-12 slices of rare beef. The first day we came, we ordered 1 bowl each. We died. Too much food. The second time we ordered two to a bowl and we were more than stuffed. 

Spring Rolls
The pork spring rolls were hot and fresh when we ordered it. The pork wasn't as well flavored as it could've been. The spring roll itself is comparable to brodards. However, the dipping sauce is comparable to summer rolls in Rosemead (bomb). 

Drinks
The coconut was fresh, cold, and delicious. The Vietnamese coffee was a bit disappointing. It tasted like powdered. 

Overall:
I will definitely be back. Best pho place I've had in Vegas in forever."}
{"text":"The pho was very delicious! We ordered 5 bowls of pho and everyone was impressed by it. The broken rice dish was also yummy. Their grilled meat was very tender! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome bbh and that's the gist of it.

I had the bun nem nuong and I took pix of the emptied bowl. Also that's the gist of that.

Any question visit this joint and find out yelpians"}
{"text":"My go to spot for nem nuong cuon..  No better way to end a Vegas trip with spring rolls for the drive home.. Very fresh veggies..  Tasty sauce..  Also like the chicken spring rolls.."}
{"text":"Got vegtable pho  Was awesome!!!!   Not sure about the broccoli book choi as i think it should have been cooked.  But maybe thats the style! Would def go back again! :)"}
{"text":"This place was decent.  I read some of the reviews prior to coming and it had its pros and cons which made me cautious about coming.  We walked in there and it wasn't busy so they said to pick a table.  No one came to take our drink orders.  It was 10 minutes before we asked if we can order drinks.  The servers where nice.

One of our friends that ate with us was her first time trying Pho.  Whatever she had ordered she enjoyed.  Another friend ordered the sausage roll and I think she liked it. She ate it all.

I ordered their Oxtail Pho and one egg roll.  I enjoyed it. Flavor of the broth was just right for my liking and not salty.  The reviews I read about this soup was the reason I tried it and they were spot on.  I had several tender pieces of oxtail in my soup and it was good.  I was going to take half of my soup home but it was so good that I just kept eating it all up.  The one egg roll I tried was just okay for me.  Some places give you all the trimmings with the pork egg roll and I thought I get a small something of trimmings but no, just one egg roll.  

I didn't get to try it but this place also serves boba and Vietnamese sandwiches.

I did read prior to coming that you can't split payment on multiple cards so I would recommend prior to ringing up the bill if they could just split the checks.  Or if it's going to be on one bill per table and least have the name of the items listed on the receipt next to the price so the customers aren't guessing what price their orders were. 

So with that being said, Happy Eatings until next time!"}
{"text":"Really not much I can say that hasn't already been said...

The Bun bo Hue (\"BBH\") here is outstanding.  I opt for no blood cubes.  What sets this bowl apart, aside from the outstanding broth, is the quality of the meat in the bowl--every piece tastes fantastic and is fall-apart-in-your-mouth tender, which you don't experience often with BBH.  I have had more than my share of frightening bowls of chewy mystery meats...

Don't let the location/building fool you.  It looks like the kind of place you might never work up the nerve to actually try, but inside it's nice and clean, and the food is fresh and really, really good.  

Enjoy!

p.s. 

Make sure you ask for the satay spicy chili paste!!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing pho restaurant I have ever been to. To make it easier, I will bullet point everything:
* the menu selection is extremely small. This restaurant did not offer any brisket, which is strange. The server told me that they did not offer any pho with brisket but my friend next to me got a bowl full of brisket in her combo pho. Not that it matters considering the brisket was DRY AND UNCHEWABLE
* no fish sauce was offered with the egg rolls we ordered. The server seemed annoyed when we asked for fish sauce and then continued to tell us that we had to make our own sweet/sour fish sauce. I have NEVER been to a Vietnamese restaurant where they didn't have fish sauce served with the egg rolls. In the end, it didn't matter because the spring rolls were not that great; however, they were better than the pho 
*the next point is that the pho is very bland. We had to add a lot of lime and sauce for it to be somewhat good. We were so surprised because this place has such good reviews on yelp. 

It's sad that this place has such bad food, along with bad service. We are Vietnamese and they talked to us as if we couldn't understand anything. We came here w/ a few drunk friends and they said the  food still was not appetizing, which is saying a lot. I highly DO NOT recommend this pho restaurant. Save your time and money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"The Bun Bo Hue here is pretty good.  A lot of ingredients.  The soup taste full of flavor.  The pork hock was not soft though.  Tendon was super soft.  There was no pork blood.  They said that the market isn't even selling pork blood right now.  Not sure why there is a shortage. They gave more meat to compensate for the pork blood shortage.

Happy Bun Boing!!"}
{"text":"After 1-day Vegas trip with all western meals (French style for lunch and Steak for dinner), we are craving for some thing Soup noodle or more Asian flavor. That's why we picked this place, ordered fried Tofu roll, chicken & pork sausage roll, spicy beef soup pho, all good. The salty lemonade with soda is so refreshing for the Vegas trip."}
{"text":"There are many better places to get Pho in Vegas than here. It's located in a run down building, a definite hole in the wall. The atmosphere isn't too great either. They messed up my order, which was as basic as can be. Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"The folks are friendly. The chairs are very uncomfortable, the dishes and cups are old. We had a rice dish. This was the most oily rice dish we've had for a while. The pho was ok. They really need to upgrade the restaurants with better tables, chairs, silverwares etc. Would not come back unless they change things."}
{"text":"WOW, seriously the best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas! We came on our recommendation from a Vietnamese  couple. It was surprisingly amazing. I didn't think a typical pho restaurant could tatse so good. My bf got the smoked beef brisket banh mi and had to order another one right after! I got the BBQ pork broken rice with egg quiche and it was truely delicious. I'm definitely coming back and trying everything on the menu. Seriously WOW. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Finally!  We were able to try the food at Pho Bosa..well, at least this location.

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and Earl ordered the vermicelli with the eggroll, shrimp cake, and pork patty.

The Bun Bo Hue was nice and spicy.  What I enjoy the most about Bun Bo Hue is the tender pork hocks.  Although there were only two small pieces, they were tender.  However, the flavor of the bun bo hue did not come through.  They were tasteless pieces of pork hocks.  I have to make sure I have spoonfuls of the soup before I eat the pork hocks. Otherwise, the soup is fragrant and delicious.

I tried Earl's food and there were tons of flavor in his bowl of yum yum stuff.   The eggroll was nice and crispy, the shrimpcake was tasty, and nem nuong (pork patty) was perfect.  We made our mixture of dipping sauce and put tons of sambal and voila!  I will order this next time!

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ended our vegas trip meal with pho. It was much needed haha. Found this whole in the wall place..kind of hard to find.. it's nothing fancy just literally a family owned place. Ordered egg rolls which came with 5 pieces and 1 large meatball and rare steak pho. The pho had a sweet aroma which wasn't to my liking but it was still good."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend for lunch by myself. Off strip food in Vegas is always more affordable and delicious! I was seated promptly by friendly servers, ordered pho dac biet (combo pho) and nem nuong rolls. The food comes out pretty quick and they bring out napkins and utensils. The rolls were good, and the wontons were crispy inside the rolls. The pho was flavorful and the meat quality was good! My bowl of pho was on point and one of the better phos I've had off strip. I like that the brisket looks like brisket and not some dried out fatty piece of meat. Overall good food and friendly service and closer from the strip. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We sat down with a table of 5, and from the start the Vietnamese lady was giving us attitude. Three of us ordered, one was still deciding and the other was. It going to eat. The lady told the indecisive one that if you don't order now, we won't get back to you until all of the other tables order (she took 30 mins to come back and take the order). The lady also rudely threw in \"ok you guys are still paying 15% service charge since you have 5 people.\" My friend decided not to order anything... the whole time, this lady was being really rude to us and other customers. Food was also not the best. Not bad, but not the best."}
{"text":"They remodeled the place! It has such a better atmosphere and more seating. I haven't been here in a good year but the food is still delicious! 

Definitely my go to viet place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is really authentic.   Sometimes it takes a little time making it, but it is totally worth the wait.  My favorite is their seasonal oxtail pho and their grilled pork rice noodle salad."}
{"text":"Second time coming back to this place tonight. The pot stickers are phenomenal, the shrimp rolls are a must have! Our sever moe was awesome, so personable and helped me choose an entree that was amazing (beef ribs). Thanks everyone so much! We live about 30 minutes away but it's worth the drive every time. Until next time!"}

{"text":"After a night of partying, we wanted pho and decided to give Pho Bosa a try. I didn't like the pho broth (it was a little too cinnamon or anise-y), but the portion sizes of the meat, noodles and broth were generous. We liked the egg rolls and appreciate the plethora of items provided to stuff in the lettuce wrap, including noodles! We thought the nem nuong rolls, while not bad, were better at Brodard in the OC.

Service was a little slow. I might come back to try the other soups (bun rieu and bun bo hue), but I don't think I'd get the pho here again. Broth is everything!"}
{"text":"Am I a soup nazi!?! Are my standards way too high because I didn't really understand all the hype on the Bun Bo Hue here -____- \"

Am I crazy or is there not a wide population of Vietnamese people here? We seriously need a a Vietnamese family to open up the back of their home and set up shop for us or something because I really have a hard time finding a nice, enjoyable, bowl of pho in this town. 

This has been placed in my bookmarks list for quite sometime now because all the rave I've been reading about their Bun Bo Hue. I love love love Bun Bo Hue ..when it's done right. Came here with merherhh (bf) and we ordered pork egg rolls that looked like Filipino lumpias more so than Vietnamese egg rolls -- long and skinny (that's what she said). They weren't that bad. I liked the fact that they gave some noodles and cucumbers with it so you could make your own fried spring roll concoction. 

Merhherh ordered the Pho and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Both were bland in flavor :| Just tasted watered down to me. I would say, maybe since it was at the end of the night so the food was lacking as they were about to close? But no, shouldn't it be even more flavorful cause the broth would be absorbing the flavor of the ingredients all day? Either way, just not my cup of tea, or rather bowl of pho.

Another thing I wasn't very fond of was that they just provide a bottle of fish sauce by the table. Not homemade?! Fish sauce in a bottle was not pleasing with my egg rolls :( 

This place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall and I usually enjoy discovering hole-in-the-walls more so then fancy smancy places, but I was honestly alert my whole visit waiting for a cockroach to make its way across the floor. 

I guess I set my expectations a little too high. It being a hole-in-the-wall I was expecting some good ol authentic Vietnamese food. I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, but definitely didn't make my top favorites list :X"}
{"text":"Was not disappointed at all!!! Must go to this place if you're craving Vietnamese food. It was a little sketchy at first because there were broken beer bottles in the parking lot, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and the surroundings were somewhat questionable, BUT amazing service, we felt loved and also the food was delicious! Will be returning to this place next time I go to Vegas !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The portions are huge. This is definitley my fav place to eat after a night out in Vegas."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went to Pho Bosa. This is my second time eatting pho and this place was delicious and attentive. I ordered the #43 rare beef pho and a peach & strawberry black tea. At the end when we received the check they told us we couldn't split the check or let us pay with with 2 seperate debt cards."}
{"text":"Excellent sevice! Came in here around 6pm and they said they were closed even though it said open on yelp. But they still ended up saying it was fine and sat us! Really delicious too, definitely coming back everytime I'm craving for Vietnamese food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"MOAR GOOD PHO IN VEGAS???

The last week we were in Vegas we stayed at the Rio so Yelped away nearby pho joints. To our surprise, this was within walking distance! Of course, we drove :)

They were out of the oxtail pho that day which was a super bummer because that's what the boo wanted. He got the rare steak with brisket instead and loved it. I ordered the veggie pho and LOVED it as well. It's hard to find veggie-based broth's that are super flavorful and this place did it right. YUMMY! We also ordered the tofu spring rolls which were just OK. We're both not a fan of tofu so that's why. Also, the peanut sauce it comes with contains chicken so vegetarians be VERY careful!!

Service for a pho joint was out of this world! The server came to check on us a few times and was extremely patient when taking our order. 

10/10 would come back here again and again :) I think we found our new pho spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was not good. The pho was bland, def try to be like California Pho. They even spelt \"BOLSA wrong\" should have known if you spell that wrong the pho was wrong also. Never again."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and the service was horrible. We asked the waiter about the menu since it didn't make sense and he was more clueless than we were. He was giving some bs answers and I asked him if he even knew how to read the menu and he admitted to us that the guy who made the menu messed up. Not just that, but he never brought us plates or bowls. In the end we left unsatisfied and will never come back here."}
{"text":"great pho in the middle of the desert!. service was fast and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Thanks yelpers for the recommendation on this place. I was attracted to this place due to the fact that they have nem nuong on the menu, but came to soothe my hang over with some soup. We ordered the bun bo hue, bun rieu, nem nuong, and egg rolls. First off let me say, this vietnamese joint has the best I mean the best service any vietnamese restaurant has to offer. Our waitress was nice, attentive, and didn't have his thumb in my soup when he dropped it off. We actually got our waters filled without having to wave someone down. The fact that he treated us with such great service and knowing that we are not regulars made me become more of a fan. The nem nuong was rolled freshly when we ordered and came out quickly. It was very good. The dipping sauce was on point. The egg rolls came with noodles, lettuce and vietnamese herbs to roll and dip. They gave us individual sauce bowls so there will be no double dipping. I got the bun bo hue and my soup came out super hot which I loved. The broth was amazing, just the right amount spice, good meat to noodles ratio. I usually have to add so much to my broth to make it the way I want it. But not with this place, all I had to do was add my herbs and veggies and eat. I tasted my hubs bun rieu and that too was amazing. I'm really glad I found out about this place, this will be our new to go to place when we're in Vegas. Btw everything is made fresh to order so there might be a wait for your food. But who cares about 15 mins when you get amazing food and service."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!!! I have been a fan of theres since there old location and was so excited when they open this new location. My favorite dishes are....Nem Nuong Cuon, Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, and there Bo Dai Han Tau Hu  Ky Rice Dish...Almost everything! There food is truly the best in NEVADA and I come here almost everyday and sometimes twice a day. I see this restaurant more then I see my kitchen at home. Not only there food is Awesome, but the people there also. I always have felt welcome and treated with spectacular service and makes me look forward to come back. If you haven't gave this place a try yet...you need to!!! Maybe I will see you there also haha...

Thanks Pho Bosa for always satisfying me and my families hunger :)"}
{"text":"This place is heaven. The pho is really good for a cheap price and the service is 20/10."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant at 5:30 on a Monday and they had a sign on the door saying they were closed because they sold out of food. Yea right. Won't be trying them again."}
{"text":"Best Bun Bo Heo in town.
I also love shirmp cake. They make it perfect.
Most places over cook the shirmp cake."}
{"text":"I had a nice Bon Rieu shrimp noodle soup!!! And my friends got beef rice noodle soups that are tasty too!!! Three of us got a bill of $28.10 only...Nice hideout place that we'll definitely come back regularly!!!"}
{"text":"well ... i should have known better... for some reason .. Vietnamese food in vegas .. just dont come close to the real thing ... there are soo many places but none offer solid pho... 

granted i didnt have pho .. but my husband did and the broth .. was super salty!!! and he can eat salt!.  soo disappointed.  i had the bun rieu and that was BLAND! 

sigh .. my advice .. dont get Vietnamese cuisine in vegas"}
{"text":"This is truly one of my favorite place in Las Vegas for Paninis???  Wait did it just say Pannini?  Yes I did!  The bbq smoked brisket it the best thing ever!  Hands down must try in Las Vegas. Will sure be back soon!"}
{"text":"Looks run down from outside of restaurant. Inside was just as bad. No ambiance and very old looking. But one thing for sure is that this restaurant is very clean. Floors are shiny and all of the condiments in a rack is so clean. I really appreciate that cleaness. My chicken soup was just ok.  Noodles were cold, broth wasn't hot enough and chicken was very chewey and absolutely no flavor. Rare steak pho was just ok as well.  Soup stock was good very clean taste but everything else was just so so.  Service staffs are very friendly and nice here."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to get our fix for our phone craving. It wasn't our first pick, the other place had a long wait. Overall, this place is slightly hidden. Service is typical for a Asian business. Waitress was an old lady that was ready to take our order, two minutes after we sat down. 

The pho was pretty good. The broth was flavorful, lots of meat, and good amount of noodles."}
{"text":"Hm....am I missing something here? 

Came by after Kabuto since I left still kind of hungry.

Ordered a large pho with steak, brisket, tendon and flank. The serving size is rather large, with lots of noodles and a small portion of meat.

The bean sprouts and basil were very fresh and clean which was a huge plus. 

Pho:
Soup was bland, basically hot water.....I don't get why it took 15 minutes.
Meat was super tender and good quality, I wished there was more
Noodles were on the softer side, but they gave a large portion of it."}
{"text":"I am rarely disappointed by a 4 star Yelp rating.  Pho Bosa was a generous 2.  I got a fresh spring roll appetizer. Asked that nothing is fried.  I've been to SE Asia.  I never before had a spring roll with fried indistinguishable crispy lank running the length.  It was not edible.  The Pho was okay.  I asked for Siracha and noticed it on a table.  The woman said, \"wait\" and snuck two portions into the plastic bag with the food.  \"Siracha,\" I said.  Yes.   Well she either lied or doesn't speak English. Because she said it was Siracha when instead Husan sauce.  I could go on.  

I was the only customer.  No surprise."}
{"text":"I've known them for their Bún bò Hu, You can't find a better spot. We've tried it at other restaurants and it is always disappointment. This place makes the best. 

Today we tried the oxtail pho, omg it's amazing. The broth is Smokey and the meat is tender. They also give a generous amount of meat in your bowl. Worth it! 

We ordered our son the broken rice and Chinese sausage. I didn't know broken rice was a thing haha I'm really amazed by this dish. It comes with an egg, green onions on top and a side of shredded daikon and carrots. There is something that they do with the Chinese sausage the glaze on top makes you keep grabbing for more bites. My son is a picky picky picky very picky eater and he tore it up. Luckily he didn't finish it and we can take it home for left overs! (Btw, came back 3 more times for this dish. Addicting.) 
 
Wife loves the pork spring rolls, I didn't want to ask for a bite because she was enjoying them so much :) she's also a picky eater so it must be good. 

They also have this drink 'cococane' coconut and sugar cane mix. So refreshing! This is a must try. 

Definitely will come back for more, and I will refer this place to my family, friends and co workers."}
{"text":"10 STARS FOR SERVICE!

We were working at a trade show and one of my co-workers got sick the first day.  So sick that she couldn't leave the hotel room and we couldn't help her because we were all working.

I called Pho Bosa to see if they deliver.  They didn't =(  I explained the situation to them and they agreed to deliver for a small fee.  They drove it to the Four Seasons and delivered it straight to her room.

Needless to say, she was bright eyed and bushy tail the next day at work and was convinced the pho speeded her recovery.  She was fine for the entire week.

Oh, and she said the food was GREAT!

Highly recommend!  Service this great must mean the food is good!"}
{"text":"Why does this place have such high ratings??? Maybe I'm spoiled from living in OC but good Vietnamese food elsewhere is hard to come by. 

After a long night of partying, a big bowl of pho sounded great for all of my hungover friends and I, but we definitely chose the wrong place to eat at. The pho broth had an off flavor, that's what ruined it for me. Even if there was superb meat (which there wasn't), broth is the main flavor component for pho so it was bad from the start. I mostly ate the meat drenched in sauce and left the rest.

One of the workers recommended the bun rieu to my friend; she said it was even better than the pho, but my friend thought otherwise. He said it was really salty and wasn't spicy whatsoever. 

Oh and why is it named BOSA? Not Bolsa?!?!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of pho, but when your friend is nursing a hangover (which you are mostly responsible for) you step up and suggest a pho meal to help ease the nausea and overall feeling of death that a hangover brings (otherwise known as a successful night of debauchery)

what i ate:
- chinese sausage spring rolls: om nom nom. Growing up with many Chinese friends, I have a total soft spot for Chinese sausages. These spring rolls were so delicious! The flavors and textures were all there! The rolls had this crunchy deep fried roll behind the sausage, giving this a great crunch. The house peanut sauce was delicious!
- combo: egg rolls, shrimp cake, grilled pork sausage (#25): the egg rolls were crispy, the shrimp cake nice and crispy, the sausage nice and meaty. This made me so happy while I was eating it, even if my friend was sadly struggling to eat her pho across the table from me

Pros:
- food! I can't speak for the pho, but the rolls and rice dish I had was delicious! 
- service: they were surprisingly busy for a late Monday morning, but they tried their best, which I appreciated. They were also very tech savvy taking payment with their iPad.
- price is decent

Cons:
- small so I could see how there would be a wait for this place

Would I come again? Sure! :)"}
{"text":"I believe that pho is the best hangover food and after a late night of parting in Vegas, it is just what I needed. Pho Bosa was about a ten minute drive from The Strip and they had plenty of parking which was great. I visited the restaurant on Sunday at 12pm and it was packed! My group of four had to wait a few minutes for a table, which wasn't bad as we got to see and smell all the delicious food coming out of the kitchen. There were some larger groups who were waiting for what seemed to be ages. One downside to the interior of the restaurant us that I don't think they have central AC so it was pretty hot in the restaurant despite the fans they had blowing.

As an appetizer, we all shared the chicken spring rolls which I haven't seen on a lot of Vietnamese restaurant menus. I thought they were delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh. I thought the Pho Ga I ordered was some of the best I've ever had. The broth was well-seasoned and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The chicken was on the drier side but that's pretty standard for the dish. My boyfriend ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien and he said, \"It was good, but not great.\" He also tried the Suong Nuong platter that our friends ordered and he said the pork chop was amazing. When they ordered it, the waitress asked if they liked pork skin but her accent made it sound like, \"Do you like foreskin?\" It took a while to figure out what she meant but it gave us a laugh.

My favorite item on the menu was the fresh young coconut that they crack open and serve with a straw and spoon. It makes you never want to drink Zico or any other packaged coconut water ever again! If I'm ever in the Las Vegas area again I would make sure to visit Pho Bosa another time."}
{"text":"Pho noodle done just right. Soup so aromatic. Bun bo hue perfect.  Call ahead to see of they have oxtail.  They ran out but I was fine without it too."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pho person, but I was on a pho kick as I caught a cold on this Vegas trip. Tried the pho on the Strip - no good! Came here and had a much better experience, though I have to agree that it's probably not head and shoulders over solid Bolsa pho (maybe they should add that L to their name?). I was very happy with the broth but the meat was too tough. The evening was saved by my soda chanh muoi, which actually had great preserved citrus chunks in it, yum!

I have a feeling we're all referring to the same guy when we compliment the service, and he was indeed very friendly. The location looks like a murder scene, on the side of an unlit commercial building, with the curtains completely drawn, offering no glimpse of what awaits until you open the door. Bang bang!"}
{"text":"First of all we had the worse service. It took them about 20 minutes to bring us our water. When the lady finally did my cup was dirty. The pho was okay. There was 4 adults and a baby. We had gotten charge an extra $5. So I asked the server what this was for and he said that parties of 5 or more . But I stated that it was only 4 adults and he was arguing back and forth with me well the baby ate didn't he . Anyways the food was also over priced. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue and bun rieu was good. Generous portions and authentic; reasonably priced too!! 
They gave a lot of side veggies and it was fresh and clean. And they allocated 2 limes per noodle soup! Pips removed too! The nem cuon was alright. And a tad pricey!"}
{"text":"Place has great service and food is good. Love the nem nuong lol I might have spelt it wrong"}
{"text":"Woke up hungover, craving pho, you know how the story goes.

Drove to Pho Bosa as it was only a mile away from our hotel on the strip. We came around 2:30pm and had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table for 2. The restaurant is tight, stuffy, and busy. The service is really good though. Our food came out quickly. The man who seated us and brought our waters was very friendly and jolly and kept cracking jokes.

Pho was $8-10 per bowl, which is expensive in my opinion, but hey, if you're craving something in Vegas, be prepared to pay for it. My man ordered pho with rare beef and beef balls. I ordered the pho in spicy lemongrass soup with pork, beef brisket, etc. I didn't like the noodles in either dish. The beef pho noodles were stale, dry, and thin. The noodles in my soup were just a cheaper version of udon.

I will say this: the quality of the meat is fantastic here. The brisket fell apart and had the perfect balance of tender meat and flavorful fat. We also ordered the pork sausage spring rolls for our appetizer, which were pretty good (although the best can only be found at Brodard in Garden Grove, CA).

Vietnamese iced coffee here is a MUST. It was rich, sweet, and smoky with a hint of caramel. Jolts you right out of that hangover! if only..."}
{"text":"I was so heart broken when Nem Nuong Bistro shut down. They really do have the best spring rolls. So when I searched \"Nem Nuong,\" Pho Bosa popped up and I decided to give it a try. Based on the pics, the rolls looked amazing. 

 I had really high hopes for this restaurant. The service was great. However, one bite into the roll and I tasted something so nasty and bitter. Awful. Then as I dissected the roll, that bitterness was the cucumber. The skin of the cucumber to be exact. 

What was confusing was - I ordered the vermicelli, which also had the cucumber but I didn't taste the bitterness of it. If anyone here knows a place that has the best Nem Nuong rolls, holler!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, even in Vegas, you need a little pho. Perhaps you need to cure your hangover or you have the case of the munchies. Pho can be that delicious bowl of happiness that you need. 

Thanks to Yelp I have discovered this place. Usually when we are in Vegas we go to this other place for pho, but it wasn't very good. Pho Bosa has better broth and more meats! Very awesome hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. I never went to a restaurant that had such rude and impolite employees. All the staff there was so incredibly rude especially this woman with the gray hair. My family and I come in with about 8 people and wanted to sit & paid separately. At first one of the employe (lady with the gray hair) said \"sit here together because the other side of the room has no heater and we will count the bill separately\". Later when our food comes out this couple walk in and she seated them in the opposite side (side with apparently no heater.) We then ask to be seated in two different tables because the restaurant was literally empty and they said no & that they will separate the bill. So we ended up sitting in a big table after hearing that the bill will be separated. After they took our order the rude gray hair lady mumble in front of our face and said \"even if you're sitting together or not you're be still paying gratuity\" in such a disrespectful tone. According to the menu a party of five and up they changed gratuity for you but we come in wanting to sit in four. Now I know why the lady in the gray hair put us in a party of eight instead of four liked we asked for. The old woman in the gray hair was so fake and changed her voice every time a new customer walk in. I didn't mine paying the gratuity but the employees there were just so impolite and ill-mannered. After we got our bill they changed for a party of 8 when we clearly asked for 4 and they said yes in the beginning. I don't recommend coming to this place because the horrible service. 

Although the service was bad and disappointing, the foods was decent. Not the best Vietnamese food I ever tasted but was still pretty good. But I still wouldn't come back. Worst restaurant ever....."}
{"text":"My group came here after a long weekend in Vegas. The place was quite empty when we got there, but it eventually got busier. My friends got the beef pho and I got the chicken. They did not have many options for beef, i only recall seeing rare fillet, beef balls, and a couple more items. For the chicken pho, they only give chicken breast, no dark meat.

Both of the broths were very well seasoned, but lacking in spices overall. They almost just tasted like beef noodle soup and chicken noodle soup instead of the traditional pho flavors. 

Also, they added fried garlic in my chicken pho, which changes the flavor greatly. I believe that pho should not contain garlic because the star ingredients are the spices like cloves and star anise etc. 

Their pho bowls only come in size large, so do consider sharing if you are a small eater. We were the first and only table when we placed the order, but the food took about 15 minutes to arrive.

We had a group of 9 people, which incurs a 15% service fee in the check. I don't recall seeing this note on the menu, but I was running low on energy so perhaps i might have missed it. They also won't split the check, but will take cards for payment, which is great. 

Parking is plenty. And the restaurant was very clean. The staff were also very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho.  Nice employees.  Attentive service.  This is our secret Pho place we found via Yelp and just love.  It sits in a questionable strip mall, but offers great food for a decent value.  Give Pho Bosa a chance - its great."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in the WORLD!! It's a little grimy in there (especially in the summer), and service could be a little more attentive, but whatever this place deserves the whole 5 stars for how goddamn delicious their pho is. you can taste the msg and feel the oil come out of your pores. Yum. if you're ever hungover after heavy night of drinking, I highly recommend you dine at pho bosa."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around lunch. I was surprised at the location that it's in a business office complex and looked borderline sketchy. My friend from out of town was with me and even said \"Where are you taking me?!\" This place had great reviews which includes some yelpers I know and my brother. There was maybe 2 or 3 parties already there when we were seated and as we waited to order the place started to get pretty packed. As most pho places in Vegas on a Sunday, most of the patrons were hung over youngsters who were at the club from the previous night. I really wanted spring rolls and saw something on the menu that was shrimp egg rolls, but unfortunately it was not the spring rolls I was expecting. It was shrimp wrapped and  deep fried and came with large pieces of lettuce on the side. It was good, but a little greasy. I ordered thin sliced beef, that came with egg rolls, a shrimp cake, and broken rice. I've never had broken rice before and it reminds me of the rice at the bottom of the rice cooker that's been there after awhile and becomes crispy. The beef and egg rolls were good, but I think I would enjoyed this meal more if I had the vermicelli with it instead of the broken rice. This was also my first time trying a shrimp cake and it looked like a piece of spam with batter, but made shrimp instead. Mine was on the greasy side because shiny oil on top was visible. Unlike my friend's shrimp cake his looked less greasier than mine. The service was pretty good because they were attentive throughout our entire meal. I even recognized one of the servers from another Pho place I used to eat at regularly. The inside its self looks like a make-shift restaurant, kind of odd but works? I still prefer other Pho places around the area, but I'll definitely come back for the Pho which is I think they're more known for."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was incredibly not-sober when eating my Bun Bo Hue here, but from what I remember, it's probably the best BBH I've ever had. The soup came out super hot and spicy, and I think my favorite part about this dish was the pork blood. It was flavored somehow where when you bit into it, you could taste the spices as well. The portion was huge, where I unfortunately couldn't finish it, but was a decent price for what they give you. Their nem nuong was also really really good, almost comparable to that of Brodards (in Southern California). 

BUT you could also disregard this review since I wasn't really \"there\", but I will be back very VERY soon to have it again."}
{"text":"I FREAKIN LOVE THEIR BANH MI!!! GRILLED PORK IS AN ORGASMIC FLAVOR I HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS. I don't really get anything else besides the banh mi. I really do not want to rate the pho or bun bo hue because I am a really hard critic for those types of soups. I highly recommend their pork spring rolls, they are better than any spring roll I have tasted from OC down to LA, the Las Vegas spring roll from Pho Bosa WINS. 


Again, don't forget to try that BANH MI!!!!!"}
{"text":"Living in the SGV, I wasn't really expecting AMAZING pho here in Vegas, let alone even get pho here. But since we all had a crazy night and the weather was cold and rainy, pho seemed like a perfect thing to have at the time. 

We came here and the place was kinda small, I'd say like 30-40 ppl could sit in there to eat. We had a part of 12 and the staff there was super friendly. 

I ended up just getting the basic Pho Dat Biet and even though I've had it so many times at home it was still good because of the weather. 

I would say that if I came again and it was rainy weather too and the night before was filled with booze again lol I would definitely come back here. Not too amazing but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"A whole in a wall gem!  Call ahead to make sure they open.  It's a family owned so emergency will make them close any day but they close every Wednesday.  My wife love the BUN BO HUE, it's spicy and great flavor.  The Korean short ribs rice dish is by far the best I ever had.  Food are cook to order so don't get upset when they busy and slow.  There are many Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas but this place create the best Vietnamese food bay far."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday during lunch and there were a lot of people.  Bun Bo hue only comes in a large sized bowl.  I like spicy but it was really spicy.  The servers were very attentive, they came around several times and asked if we needed anything.  The lady at the register was really nice too."}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait is too long, takes forever to get the food and the staff is unfriendly. The person who took our order sounded almost angry. On top of that, a 15% service charge (on the after tax amount) for a party of 5 or more seems a bit excessive - especially when you're also pressed to tip them in addition to the service charge. Being charged for every little thing we asked for (e.g. A bit of extra onion for pho), regardless of the final amount, all in all it was not a pleasant dining experience.. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food: According to their website and menu, they're known for their broken rice dishes. They take pride in being the best in Vegas. It wasn't until later that they started serving pho due to popular demand. This was my first time eating here and I was in the mood for pho, so I ordered their pho dac biet and their pork Spring rolls. Both were pretty dang good for this hungry guy and if pho isn't their specialty, you can bet that I'll be back next time to try one of their broken rice dishes!

Service: Service was pretty good. I was seated right away. Even with a huge party of about 20 people and smaller groups already there when I got there, I never did once felt neglected by the waitstaff.

Location: It is located in a not so nice area of Vegas. There's nothing aesthetically pleasing about the place. It's not quite located in the thriving Chinatown just further West down the road on Spring Mountain. You'll have to turn onto Polaris Ave to get into the parking lot. Inside the restaurant can get pretty warm. They currently do not have working air conditioning, but they do have several huge fans running to help with the heat. It's actually tolerable if you happen to be eating a hot bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Best nem nuong in town! Also, great bun rieu noodle and bun bo. Tried their oxtail soup for the first time. It was ok, not as great as I had expected. The service is great and friendly. Always check in to see if we need anything and refill our drinks. We always make a visit here when we're in sin city."}
{"text":"For no fail and very good Vietnamese food come to Pho Bosa!! :))"}
{"text":"Food Ordered:

Pho: 
-Broth was WAY too salty. I felt my blood pressure rise with every bite. 
-Noodle portions were small (noodles were balled up, but about half the size of your palm) 

Pennyworth Drink: 
-Tasted like sugar water and the cup was filled to the brim with ice. 


BIGGEST COMPLAINT: 

The bill they give you is vague and primitive. There are NO item descriptions, just prices. Also, if you are in a party of 5 or more, there is a 15% service fee (which is just manually calculated and scribbled in there). 

If eating in large parties with many orders, be SURE to double check all prices very carefully. Considering many people are in Vegas are tourists, you may be drunk/ hungover and not notice that you were charged extra for something you did not order.


Summary: 

We felt very ripped off after eating here in terms or portions and taste. Then we really got ripped off when I paid the bill (our fault for not thoroughly reviewing the bill)."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my family for the first time and everything was good.  We waited about 30 - 45 mins for a table of four.  The place was small and it no more than 10 - 13 tables.  We shared a Korean BBQ rice plate, nem nuong rolls, and bun rieu and all the dishes were delicious.  The soup bowl was huge.  The services were fast and the prices were a little expensive.  We've tried a few Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas and this place so far the best."}
{"text":"We have to stop by this place to eat every time we're here l in Vegas cause the foods here are very authentic Vietnamese. From Pho Bo to Broken Rice with BBQ pork and chicken (Com Tam Thit Nuong and Ga Nuong) dishes to Bun Bo Hue and all.. everything tastes so good. Staffs are very friendly too. If Yelp have 6 stars available I would give them 6 stars, not 5. If you don't mind about fancy decorations restaurant, but wanted good authentic Vietnamese foods, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of the things I like to do when I'm out of town is to try the pho in the area I'm visiting. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to travel often and let me say the Pho here holds up real well to any I have tasted. The broth (my favorite part of pho) is rich and flavorful. Plenty of meats including meatballs, brisket, flanks, tendon etc.. Asian comfort food at its finest. Definite must try again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Location is a little weird, definitely a bit \"hole-in-the-wall\" but we liked the food. Found this place off Yelp. We were craving pho before we hit the road back to San Diego. There was a wait when we got there, the host was very nice though. He offered me water while we were waiting because I wasn't feeling very well. Once we got seated we ordered:
- 3 large bowls of beef pho
- Thai Tea
- Spring Rolls

It was all tasty. I would def come here again."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST PHO EVER in Las Vegas AND IN THE UNITED STATES! Small restaurant, great staff, super friendly and quick service. The broth is fantastic even by itself, truly a culinary delight and a must have when in Las Vegas. I always order the vegetarian pho and I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa is a small mom & pop Pho restaurant that has been consistently good throughout my visits...I'm a fan..

Bosa service:  Every visit we've been seated immediately which is one of the main reasons I frequent here.  The kitchen gets the dishes out quickly and keeps the drinks fresh as well.  Drinks are self serve which I prefer at smaller mom and pop restaurants.

Bosa Grindage:  All the Pho bowls I've consumed consistently have had flavorful broth and noodles.  The Pho with oxtail was a special which I hope makes it to the menu permanently.  I always appetize up with the the Pork Fresh Rolls, super yummy.  The rice plates come loaded with: rice, egg rolls, egg cake plus whatever meat/protein you selected.

The dining area is super casual as all mom and pop joints area and it's clean and there's plenty of seating for a small restaurant which makes for consistent immediate seating.  The menu is extensive with lots of Pho bowls and dishes to sample for a great price.  This will bring me back for more visits but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"The a.c. must've been broken. The ceiling fans and portables were on full blast, which didn't help much. Eating a hot bowl of pho in a hot restaurant is a no go. The pho was ok, more salty than anything. Servers weren't friendly, especially the guy. He stood at the table staring at us with his pad and pen. No, \"Hi, how are you? Are you ready to order?\" Nothing. Maybe he was having a bad day?"}
{"text":"Bun rieu is life after a long night out. The bun rieu here is to die for. Their soup base is so flavorful and their crab meatballs were amazing. They were so generous with their crab meatballs and there was way more crab/shrimp than there was meat, which for me personally, is what I'm looking for in a great bun rieu - quality ingredients. The noodles they put in the bun rieu were a bit too hard for my liking. They were almost crunchy? I think if they were just cooked a bit longer they would have been fine. 

I can't really speak for anything else here besides the bun rieu. My friends got different varieties of pho, and they all said it was ok. My vietnamese friend said that the broth for the regular phos were weak/lacking depth of flavor, but then again he said that he was spoiled by the pho his parents spent hours making at home. The one thing we all agreed on though was that that was the longest we've ever waited for an order of pho to come out. We came in around 12 for lunch and ordered by 12:10pm. Our pho and spring rolls did not come out for almost 35-40 minutes. But, if I'm ever back in Vegas, I'll be sure to come back here after a long night out for a good bowl of bun rieu. 

Cons:
- Long wait for food so be prepared if you're starving
- Pho broths were lacking depth of flavor
- Noodles were a little under cooked

Pros: 
- Service was great
- Bun rieu here is amazing!! 
- Relatively easy to find parking 
- Quite little area off the strip away from the hustle and bustle
- Great hangover cure for anyone who needs one"}
{"text":"Taste is great and pricing is decent, but the service is so SLOW.

Took us ~30 mins to get our food.... For a Vietnamese pho spot... That is WAY TOO LONG. 

Their spring rolls are delicious. Nice crunch to them. 

They have plenty of parking and aren't too far off the strip. 

Considering I was one of the very few non Asians here... And many were Vietnamese, helps let you know the food is good. I just wish the service was faster !"}
{"text":"My love for Vietnamese food extended to Las Vegas! After partying hard at Marquee and Drais, this was a great way to remedy my hangover feeling. 

The restaurant is hidden in an plaza and hard to spot from the street. It's about $10 cab ride from the strip. 

When my friends and I came in, the restaurant is dainty and probably would fit a maximum of 30-40 people. We were seated in the back of the restaurant. 

My friends ordered Pho and I ordered Bun Bo Hue (my all time fave). The service was a little slow, but worth the wait when Bun Bo Hue was served to me. The broth was to die for!! One of my friends tasted my broth before she received her Pho and she also agreed that it was delicious. She felt distaste after tasting the broth, her Pho seemed mediocre. 

This place also had a check-in deal for Che (three colored drink, $2.99), which was also delicious!

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Was so good!! I didn't have pho but I had #77, which had mashed up crab and bay shrimp, and the spicy flavor reminded me of the south which I thought was weird.  We also had these light and crispy shrimp cakes, even the spring rolls were better than the average spring roll!  I like the location, I just wish it had later hours or was 24 hr."}
{"text":"So many food options when visiting Vegas and pho off the strip is probably not one of the top food choices.  However, don't overlook Pho Bosa, this place is authentic and worth making a trip to!!  

Noodle soup is the perfect comfort food after a long night of partying but when you pair it with such great flavors as to what Pho Bosa offers, you don't need a drunken/hung over reason to come here.  We ordered both the Bun Rieu and Bun Bo Hue and they were both stellar, reminds me of the ones that I have had at my friends' houses growing up.  Super authentic, you can taste the hours spent making the broth.  Don't forget to order the Nem Nuong Cuon (pork spring rolls), they were sooooo good and it's not often that you can find the crispy crunchy skin in all spring rolls.  Deeeeelicious! 

Service was super warm and friendly, we were checked on several times.  Plus, prices here are more than reasonable.  It beats paying $15+ for a bowl of pho on the strip.

The next you are in Vegas, make a trip over to Spring Mountain Rd. and give Pho Bosa a try!  Don't forget to come early tho, the restaurant itself is relatively small and gets packed fast."}
{"text":"Checked out the new location. 

Bigger space, similar pricing.

Nice thick beef spices in your Spicy Beef Noodles (bun bo hue).

They offer plenty soup, adequate meat portions, slightly slim on the noodles. Veggies and herbs accompanying the are fresh."}
{"text":"Get the pho in here!!

Clean facility. Very regular.

Employees are nice, waiter helped us refill our water bottles. Sat us down, took our orders, and was accommodating to our growing party of noodles eaters.

The soup is so good, a nice beef broth, and the portions are big! They put a good amount of onions and give a lot of basil, lime, jalapenos, and bean sprouts. Eggrolls aren't bad too. Nice and crispy and comes with noodles and really fresh lettuce to wrap.

It's traditional to end a Vegas trip with Pho (it's amazing hangover food) and I might just come back here again! It's closer to the strip."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday 11:30am, service, price, freshness is on punt, however, the broth was extremely under cooked and waaay took light."}
{"text":"I arrived for lunch and tried the Bun Rieu instead of my regular Bun Bo Hue. I like this new location compared to the old one BC parking is convenient and the restaurant is larger but still quaint.

The Bun Rieu is in the $9.00 range but the flavor and ingredients are top notch. Generous amounts of crab meat, tomato's, yummy noodles and a killer hroth. Service from the male waiter and I think owners husband is friendly and speaks Vietnamese but sure doesn't look Vietnamese.

I've yet to try the Pho here so I have another reason to return here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Holy crap, 50 minutes and our food still hasn't come. Slowest cook and prep time I've ever experienced for a pho restaurant. Food is also mediocre and the pork spring roll is meh compared to Brodard. Yelp reviews mislead customers like us... Don't come."}
{"text":"One of the closer pho restaurants located near the strip. The food was tasty; however, the service took ridiculously long - I am not exaggerating when it took around 15-20 minutes. The restaurant did not have much seating and it was quite full. As soon as we were seated, we were left in the dark for a while with no updates from the waiters about whether or not our food was coming out. If you're willing to wait at least 15 minutes for your food then give this place a shot."}
{"text":"As a former Californian, I was devastated after moving to Las Vegas. The Vietnamese food scene here is lackluster (but slowly improving). Luckily, I was quickly introduced to Bosa 1 for their amazing rice plates. Not long thereafter, I fell in love with their fantastic bun bo hue and bun rieu...just like my mom used to make!!

The portions are generous, the ingredients fresh and of superb quality. You can taste the homemade goodness in everything -- from the perfectly-cooked broken rice to the moist egg quiche to the amazing lemongrass bun bo hue broth.

I used to eat at the old location at least 2-3 times a week. And during their several-month hiatus/relocation, I was like a druggie on withdrawal. I *craved* a good rice plate, and I must've visited every single Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas to get my fix. But alas, I was met with disappointment EVERY SINGLE TIME. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when Pho Bosa reopened; it was like my dealer had teased me so I would want more, and I've definitely been back many times to reclaim that euphoria.

I work as a VIP concierge at a large upscale resort/casino on the Strip, and I'm often asked where to get pho/Vietnamese food. You can be sure I never send them to the TI(t)!! Every guest that had taken my advice has come back raving about the wonderful food, service and prices.

Bosa 1/Pho Bosa is the best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, hands down! But don't just take my word for it; check out what these other local media outlets have to say:

http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/oct/03/vegas-best-vietnamese-back-and-better-ever/

http://www.eatinglv.com/2009/08/bosa-1-boffo-vietnamese/

http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2009/jul/09/bosa-truly-no-1/

With their new location comes extended open hours, credit card payments and a slightly larger dining area. The staff is still just as friendly and accommodating. Do note that they are closed on Wednesdays. If you're a lucky local or just a Vegas visitor, do not miss the chance to enjoy the great offerings at this humble but wonderful restaurant.

And in response to Sandra C. from Encino, CA:
Honey, if you actually read the reviews like you claim you did, you'll notice that this is the reincarnation of their first store, Bosa 1. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz/bosa-1-las-vegas

How about you check out their nearly-100 high-ranked reviews there before making yourself look like an idiot. And another thing, I've worked at several businesses (large and small) where they use ipads for signing. Most people are STUPID and use their fingernails REGARDLESS of how much you emphasize to use their actual fingers. With your attitude, your bad experience must've been of your own making anyway. I feel sorry for you; it must be impossible to ever make you happy. Perhaps you should just go rejoin all the hipsters at Pho Kim Long, as that seems to be more your scene."}
{"text":"Came here when I visited Vegas this past weekend & it was pretty good. I think all of their pho bowls are large only. I got the pho tai & it was delicious. Broth was very flavorful. 

I also got the pork spring roll & that was so good as well. I love the crunchy fried wonton stick they have inside. 

The restaurant is very small though with a limited amount of seatings as compared to other pho restaurants. I wouldn't mind coming here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday after church for lunch, and it was not busy at all. It was my first time here, and I really enjoyed what I got. I got a tofu roll appetizer with broken rice, and also had some beef pho. 
The tofu roll comes with dipping sauces on the side (either a soy type sauce or peanut sauce; I got both), and it is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten, and is going to be the thing I will come back to Pho Bosa for. The pho was standard but still very good.  I also really like that they have a bottle of that Vietnamese fish sauce on every table. 

Overall, very good Vietnamese food, and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to try after reading so many good Yelp reviews and seeing so many good pictures but this place was a little let down. The good was that they had milk tea, we got sat really fast, our food came out fast, pretty cheap and the staff was really nice. I got the Pho Dac Biet (meatballs, rare beef slices, brisket, and tendon) they only have two types of meat. It came with a lot of meat but the meat (it was suppose to be brisket I think) had a lot of fat on it and the texture to the meat was not chewy, the meatball was softer. I don't know what happened to my meat in my bowl pho but it was not good at all but the broth was good though. They don't have egg noodles either and it's only one size for all their pho bowls."}
{"text":"I asked the waiter what their restaurant is known for...his response was bun bo hue and bun rieu. I ordered the bun rieu...omfg...amazing! The portion, quality, and taste were the best bun rieu ive ever had. All worth it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of an abusive relationship. One server was extremely nice and the other almost made my friend cry. Beside that the food was extremely authentic. We left with mystery meat stuck in our teeth."}
{"text":"Place was okay, I actually went here june 21st of last month and thought id wait to see if my review  remains. So every little thing they charged came up quite a bit if you're with a lot of people. They charged for putting the meat seperate from pho, water, and just little things like that. Place is very small as I stated earlier, not a great place for a large group and make sure you bring cash! Can't use card under 25$ purchase.

Pho was okay, noodles didn't taste that well, bun bo was decent. Cam tam (broken rice with pork) was bland, not really much flavor even with sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Get over the sketchy neighborhood! The Pho Tendon is the best I've had.  Simmered many hours to achieve delicate perfection that sails over your taste buds. It was so nice we came here twice while in Vegas for a week. The Pho only comes in one size with generous amounts of Pho.  You will be full and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pho, the waiter was so helpful and on point. He verified to make sure everything was vegan and gluten free. Their soup was absolutely amazing. I will 100% return to this place. Flavor and everything else is on par!"}
{"text":"after a night out in vegas, we were all craving some pho. after thoroughly going through yelp, we chose pho bosa, and i have no regrets. This has to be in my top three meals during my time in vegas. we had gotten two orders of the sausage spring roll, which was so tasty i almost wish i had gotten more, but with all the orders we made, it seemed unwise. Our group of five had 3 orders of the bun bo hue (#77), which you can add sliced cabbage and onions and sprouts to, an order of beef pho (#71), and the vermicelli shrimp crab soup (#78). We had also gotten a vermicelli bowl with porkchop and fried spring roll. Everything was delicious and if i'm ever in vegas again, i will be back! Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese place in Vegas. Great food. Great coffee. Great service.

Tried the egg rolls, oxtail pho, bun bo hue, and grilled chicken with rice. All delicious."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend when we were in Vegas. The first time I feel sort of duped by the Yelp reviews but I guess my bad for not double checking how many reviews there are really and that it's not enough for a good statistics, but we tried, and we failed. 

Bf and I go to San Gabriel a lot and their Viet food and selection are not bad, and Westminster area definitely is better every time we go. But I really can't see how this place is 5 stars, the only thing could be there's just not much Pho restaurants nearby to begin with and so there is not much to compare?

This place has got some bad service, rude. Seating you down and doesnt take your order for another 10 minutes. After ordering food took over 30 minutes to come out. And you know what is the most infuriating part? People that came in after us and ordered the same thing (the most common pho order) got their food first! That is seriously one of my biggest pet peeve. Some of us tried to order for the meat to come on the side instead of in the broth, and the server has the nerve to say they can't do it because their too busy, which obviously must be truth since the food seems like it was coming out in snail pace. I couldn't even enjoy the food I was in such a bad mood. The taste was okay, didn't see what the 5-star hype was about. Oh and in the end while we try to pay the bill, they used the iPad to sign for the credit card transactions and server/ manager was rude/strange? He said. \"You can use any fingers to sign, any at all. Just no nails\". Last I know from anatomy class, finger does not equal nail. What?!

As I re-read this, it sounds so harsh compared to the other glowing reviews. But I always call it for what it's worth, and it's not worth 5 stars at all. :("}
{"text":"After spending a few days in Vegas eating casino food, we really needed to have a home cooked - non buffet - meal. So we searched Yelp for suggestions and found Pho Bosa. We were exploring town so it was close to where we were, in the Rio area, found several places but Yelp gave the place a good review so we went in. We were early for dinner but was surprised that it was empty, but they had several people waiting for their to go items.

We were immediately seated, asked if we had any questions, both staff - the owners we found out, were very friendly and made the right recommendations, which we took them up on. 

There were four of us so we had a good variety and tasted each other's food. Everything was awesome!! The meat was tender and tasty - had both beef and pork. The rice was flaky, a little sticky, just right. We also had the noodles. Love the fact we can make our own sauce and as much as we wanted. All our dishes had the eggroll. We were going to go for desert but we were too full. The plates were very generous. They were very attentive and friendly. We will definitely come back again the next time we're in town, which is August of this year.

Prices were very reasonable. Let's just say, for the cost of one person's buffet dinner meal, we paid for the entire meal here. And to top it off, we were very satisfied whereas the last two day's worth of meals at the casino were not the greatest. We are definitely keeping this place in mind because I can't eat a week's worth of casino meals especially knowing that just off the strip are home cooked meals."}
{"text":"The food is horrible and they charge you a arm and leg, check the bill before you pay!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Nem nuong, Bun Bo Hue and Broken rice in Las Vegas. I will be back this restaurant again again and again."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and I randomly picked this place. They have a good operation here. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"OH man, I hope I don't get hate mail from Antonia R. for this one. I went here after her super enthusiasm about the pork rolls and the bun rieu. Those pork rolls, they look so dang good. 

I believe my expectations were too high, and the items we ordered were not as awesome as the photos. Sorry, Antonia! :(  My better half wasn't too enthusiastic either. Maybe I just don't have the knack for recognizing super good vietnamese food? 

I saw a ton of local vietnamese eating here, so, maybe it's just me?"}
{"text":"This is the pho place to go get your cravings fix in Vegas. Best one so far outside of Fresno. Must give this place a shot for your hangover cure lol."}
{"text":"The pho was really good, and so were the spring roll appetizers. Only reason its not a four star is because the lady/waitress/cook? who was taking our orders was also rolling up some eggroll papers on the table next to us. On top of that she was looking at her phone (lots and lots of germs on our phones :/) and touching it then continued rolling. I am usually pretty cool with that stuff, but i wish she took that to the kitchen, and possibly wash her hands! BUT the food was worth FIVE stars!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and really wanted to try it. I'm glad we did because their bun bo hue is so good! They also have blood cake in their soup which is one of my favorites additions in any noodle soup ao that got an extra star from me. My fiancé had their pho tai bo vien and their broth was flavorful. Would definitely go back again. It was sort of difficult finding this place since the center they are in is like a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Best Vietnam food in the town!!
Please open Monday to sunday. I know this place always closed on Wednesday. And Wednesday mostly my day off. :( 
My favorite is pork chop with broken rice.. yummm"}
{"text":"Flavorful pho with good meat to noodle ratio.  The sausage spring rolls at the beginning of our meal were so good!!! I wanted to return later in the evening just for the spring rolls.  The service is good too.

The only complaint was having to go find the bathroom outside the establishment.  The bathrooms are outside in a hallway that is dark.  Have to ask the employees for a key to unlock the bathroom door."}
{"text":"Ok the food here is great, but the location is very interesting. It is in what looks to be a run down building.   However once you get past the building your in for a nice surprise.   

I had the bun rieu, it was lacking flavor until I drenched it with the fish sauce bottle on the table and added the chili sauce to finish it off. I asked why so blan, they replied that some people were complain it was too spicy and salty. So instead they let you add your finishing touches.

The broken rice dishes was the best in town and have earned our business if we are craving rice.

As for the other dishes we haven't tried yet, but will soon."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly and prompt service, incredibly fresh delicious pho soup. This place is 5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because everyone seems to rate at least 4 stars but it ain't even close! The pho noodles are not even fresh. It seems like it was made by putting the noodles from the bag into the bowl and then poured the soup on rather than dipping the noodles in the boiled soup first to soften the noodles. If you're from Bolsa for real, then by all mean, avoid this imitation \"Bosa\" pho. The bun bo was not close so avoid this as well. It seems like they use the same soup on pho and bun bo. Needless to say that the service was typical asian bad service. The environment is stuffy and not very comfortable."}
{"text":"During that 20min taxi ride to Pho Bosa, the only thing I could think of is this is probably not worth the trip.  Needless to say, when we arrived and faced another 45min wait, the only thing that kept me there was the fact that it was 45C & burning outside in Vegas and this tiny resto at least had AC we could seek shelter from

I was wrong; the food was just excellent.  The server was so kind and gave us tips on transportation from the resto, and we ordered their classic pho.  Texture was great and flavour was deliciously present, but the winner of the day was probably the iced Vietnamese coffee.  Not too sweet but gave us all kinds of caffeinated happiness; we decided to get their vermicelli and rice dishes for take out as a quick meal for the next day.  Even though we ate the takeout cold the next day, it was still full of flavour and enjoyable.

If you're trying to save $ in Vegas while not losing out on quality, Pho Bosa is it"}
{"text":"My first night in Vegas and looking for some good Pho. Yelp to the rescue! My buddy almost took me to one about a block away, but we looked it up on Yelp before we went in. It only had two and 1/2 stars, so we peeled out of there and headed here! It was night time and they had a strobe light outside and it didn't look like much from outside. I thought maybe it was some kind of Pho strip club!  The food was delicious! I ordered the grilled pork noodle -bun tit noon. My buddy ordered the standard hot Beef Pho."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Chinatown - but not for long.  You can't keep great food and service silent in this town for long.  Yes, it is a bit hidden from the main areas of Chinatown and the place is small, but this is the second time I went to this place with out of town guests - which is rare for me.  If you want to get a delicious meal that not many people know about unless their on yelp - you definitely have to try Pho Bosa - plus the staff are very friendly!! 10 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Came here since it was close to Paris Hotel where we were staying. It's. Little ways off the strip near the Rio Hotel. It's a little hole in the wall a little strip mall. They offer quite a bit of selection of flavored black teas. For appetizers we had a pork sausage spring roll which was really good. You get 4 huge pieces and fills your tummy quite nicely before your main dish. The deep fried aping roll is pretty much your typical kind of you find in most Vietnamese restaurant. The Pho here comes in one size, large so bring your appetite with you."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  Full flavor and lives up to the great reviews and high rating.

I had the Pho with Steak & Beef Ball - The broth is so good (which everyone knows a good Pho is the broth)

My friend had the Bun Rieun and he really like it also it was his first time having it.

Also the Thai Ice Tea was really good, I think it was the best one I ever had.

Definitely be back whenever i am in Vegas with a rent a car=)

Only thing bad about this place is the location which was in the side corner which I thought it was an apartment building or something with many empty businesses."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking and partying, pho is the only answer.  You need electrolytes and fluids.  IV fluids could fix you up but that's expensive and you're still hungry.  

The grilled pork sausage spring rolls is a must.  It's crunch and savory.  The dripping sauce is amazing as well.  I wish every Vietnamese restaurant had it.  The pho is delicious.  The broth is flavorful enough to use no or minimal hoisin/sirarcha.  The noodles were fresh.  Add some basil and bean sprouts and dig in.  If you're not feeling pho, the bun rieu is a good alternative.    The crab tomato broth is awesome.  Perfect amount of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing. We almost passed this place, it was the only place open at night in what looks like an old motel turned business center. Once we realized we were at the restaurant and not in an abandoned strip mall, we were sat right away as it was late on a Sunday and we were the only people there. Two of us ordered the pho (with meat balls and rare steak), one ordered broken rice with chicken and one ordered beef stew which was off the menu. Everything was delicious, particularly the beef stew. If you're looking for great eats just off the strip I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Everyone in Vegas always goes to Pho-Kim Long after a long night of drinking and partying. I've been there multiple times but after finding this place, I found my new Pho place to go to!

This hole in the wall seems much more authentic than Pho-Kim Long in my opinion. 
Don't get me wrong, the outside of this place does seem a bit sketch and it is located off the strip but the dishes I've tried so far has exceeded my expectations. I tried this place twice and I enjoyed much more than Pho-king. Probably come here from now on~

They have their own lot so parking is not an issue!

However, there is one particular lady who does have a bit of attitude. Oh well.. I just ignore it."}
{"text":"I wasn't too surprised to find a Pho spot in Vegas but boy was it a great idea after a night of drinking! The broth was warm and extremely sobering. I went with a large group and the establishment was able to accommodate. Compared to Pho I get on the regular (and the Pho I had in Vietnam this year) this was good but not great. Typical fixins' but the overall dish seemed to be missing some dimension. They used a ton of rare steak which was a plus and the noodles were filling. The most surprising part was that it costs almost exactly the same price as most other places in the states. I expected the price to be a bit inflated due to location but not here. The staff were so nice and friendly. I'd describe them as funny as well. It was a great experience overall and I'd come back to try something different just based on that. Sometimes it's not the food that keeps you coming back. Ya know?

Not so humbly submitted,
Michael C."}
{"text":"Enormously large bowls of pho for less than $9! 

- Strong and rich Thai iced coffee 
- Pho has generous servings of noodles and meat with a rich and hearty broth  
- Vermicelli buns are filled with fresh and picked veggies, fried egg rolls, and your choice of meat on a bed of rice noodles (my friends ordered short rib and grilled shrimp and were big fans) 
- Bun Rieu (crab/tomato noodle soup) portion is large and quite flavorful 
- Housemade fish sauce is awesome! 
- Quick, attentive, and friendly service 

I haven't been back since my first visit several months ago and really need to come back. It's nearing pho weather and the cravings will probably start kicking in!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I didn't get to try their bun rieu. We came late, close to when they were closing, so they ran out of noodles. Instead, we ordered their spring rolls. We were having a bad day so we were a little grumpy when we were told that they didn't have much to offer. They said they could sub pho noodles in the bun rieu but I knew it wouldn't be the same. They probably sensed our irritation and felt bad for not having much to offer, so they tried to comp our meal. That was a very kind gesture, but it wasn't their fault so we insisted to pay. Five stars for this genuine establishment that cares about their customers. Next time, I'll make sure to come early!"}
{"text":"the best pho in vegas - and that's the truth. Maybe I haven't explored enough pho places in the area but the pho here was even better than what I get in LA. 

We drove here and was very discouraged from entering. It is in a shady area and you absolutely would not see this place if it wasn't for the epilepsy inducing light outside. My friend wanted to leave but I insisted on trying it and had the best meal I had on my vegas trip. A. MUST. TRY."}
{"text":"Service was very poor,disorganized, everyone is so busy they don't have time for their patrons. I come from  Washington State  and have had more then  my fair share  of pho the best review I'd give here would be a 6 or 7. You need to be ready to be very patient because this restaurant hasn't learned people skills yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, service is awesome, small but comfy location.  Only 4/5 stars because when it gets busy parking is hard to find and dining area isn't big which could be a problem if you are holding a party of 20 people or more."}
{"text":"Pho was ok, not great. Staff was rude, when we asked about menu confusion. Then they asked to move tables cause a bigger party came. Not allowed to split the check and $25 minimum charge on the card."}
{"text":"This place was great! Ive been having trouble finding good, or even decent food out here in Vegas, this place does good Vietnamese food. I had pho, their broth is the most unique ive had, different, but good. And ive been to plenty of good pho restaurants. My girl friend had vermicelli with chicken that was also really good. The location is just a little sketchy looking though lol."}
{"text":"Their bun bo hue is so bad... the soups is flavorless, very diluted. The noodles are overcooked. The amount of noodles I got was very limited as well. It was my first time here and my last. No idea how this place got so many reviews and such high rating."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch from time to time... the best food comes from best and freshly cut ingredients, so don't expect the soup to be ready in 2 minutes after you place the order... expect a very delicious fresh meal....

Mostly I'm ordering the Combination Soup which has all their possible meat, I wish they would have a lunch special tho, I would have come more often...

The review for this place are mixed, but I would still recommend it, I'm sure most the people will like it, so you should give the place a shot...."}
{"text":"A lot MSG!!!!!!if you are trying to find a \"soup\" after hang over. Definitely not this place!!!!! Me and my girlfriend didn't touch the pho after taste the soup. MSG!!"}
{"text":"Best place for curing your hangover after a night of partying. Order the fresh coconuts, they will help you rehydrate faster. Also recommend the bo bun hue soup. They charge u extra dollar if u want the soup with another combo but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Was craving for some pho so decided to check this place out with my family. There was no wait around 2PM on a weekday and plenty of parking. Now onto the food!

Bun Rieu - DO NOT ORDER. The crab is non existent. The blend of meat is just pork and egg and the tofu in the soup is not good.

Bun Bo Hue - the soup was average and the noodles were perfect. The meat is a bit tough and the pork blood is not the best, but it'll satisfy your cravings.

Pho Dac Biet - my family had this and they they could taste a lot of the MSG. They said they gave a good amount of meat. 

Overall, bowls were a good size but a very average place. They also accept credit card.  

Note: all bowls are large and they do charge a 15% service charge AFTER tax for parties of 5 or more."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town & saw this place had 4 stars so gave it a try. We were very impressed with the service & owner was so nice. We had Bun bo hue & Bun rieu. Both were amazing. Short ribs very tasty also. Would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"What does a man call for after a long night of drinking?  PHO!  Took to my handy Yelp app and found Pho Bosa.

It's probably one of the better Pho joint near the strip.  However, not by CA standard.  Of course, since we are in NV I have to say it's was pretty good.  A little weak on the broth, first time I had to add fish sauce to my broth.  The meat wasn't the best quality, but there was a lot of it.  It was also the first time I found my noodles to be undercooked.  I love that they did not skimp on the herbs.

Overall, a nice place to get a decent bowl of pho if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Well $9 for a bowl of pho? It's reasonable, not too pricey given that it is pretty near the strip and portion is huge so it is kind of acceptable. But do take note that due to the small capacity of the place, be prepared to wait in line. Overall not be best but good enough to satisfy your cravings for the day!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's location was off the 15 freeway on west spring mountain it's very close. The exterior was very dark and you cant see the restaurant from the outside bec. of the dark tinted windows. It was located in a peculiar looking business establishment with offices around it.

 The food was good plain and simple. We ordered the spring rolls which was freshly made by them unlike other restaurants that serves you frozen spring roll. 

We also ordered the beef and pork toppings with rice served with pickles which was good for our sweet and spicy taste buds. 

The last item we ordered was the clear soup with shredded beef and balls. This was probably one of their specialty soups in the restaurant and it was worth it. 

The price was around 10 bucks for the soup and 9 bucks for the beef and pork toppings with rice.  

Service was what you expect in a small Asian restaurant very passive. The inside was clean and service was quick."}
{"text":"Omg... The best service ever. The food was delicious specially the sea food soup. The price is good too."}
{"text":"I've been to a few good and not so good Pho restaurants in the last few years and this one is a nice find.  Soup was a 7.5 out of 10. Could have gotten a higher score with a better cut of beef.  Over all the broth was excellent and there was enough noodles and condiments to go with it.  Service was a little better than most Vietnamese places as well.  Some folks mention the location as being a bit sketchy but I didn't see anything wrong with it.  I'd definitely be back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Bosa 1 is back. But they serve pho now, so it's called Pho Bosa. I really should wait until I try their pho and also make sure their Bun Bo Hue is still legit before I write this review. But what the heck. Pho Bosa is as good as it gets.

Yes, this is based on my one lunch visit today whereby I ordered the Bun Rieu and promptly proceeded to inhale it. Yes, their interior and exterior leave a ton to be desired. Yes, it's strange that you have to go outside to access the restrooms. Yes, they... actually that's all I can think of.

I'm definitely going back for the Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because it was a lifesaver for a Sunday hangover! We stopped by here to get some pho before our 6 hour drive back home (which was hell).

Their egg rolls came out fresh and piping hot - amazing! And I got their pho tai which was pretty good except I could taste the frozen taste from the meat... maybe it was old? Regardless, I finished my whole entire bowl without a single drop of broth left!"}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Vegas, we thought of trying out Asian food on the West coast. It was, as I was told, supposedly much more authentic and tastier than what I am used to from my local Pho place. 

So we got Bo Bun Hue, Nem Nuong Cuon and the Korean ribs combo that came with broken rice and egg rolls. I didn't really try the Bo Bun Hue. It was supposedly mad spicy. Stayed away from it. I had the Korean ribs which I thought were a bit mediocre and the egg rolls wasn't anything I would rave about. 

Why the four stars then? I loved loved loved loved loved their Nem Nuong Cuon. It's basically a spring roll with Vietnamese prom sausage. It was soooooo good. I can eat this all day errrday. The dipping peanut(?) complimented the roll very well. A definite must try. I wonder why we do not have this in the east coast :(

The place has a homey feeling. I was watching the Asian mother-son across us. The boy was getting a lecture from mom about school. Ahhhhhh just like home."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I remembered.... I was soooo excited to come back and give it another go, especially for the spring rolls(nem nuong). I came with my best friend and I was totally raving to her about how good this place was. She ordered a soup and I had the BBQ short ribs, I can never go wrong with it.

 My friends soup was decent, but nothing compares to the pho shops in Oakland. As for the short ribs, it came cut into small pieces. The flavor was good, but it did not like how they had a ton of fat on them... It was like I was eating oil. The spring rolls were definitely not what I remembered... The flavor was extremely off, especially the sauce.

The service was good as usual, but nothing compares to the service that I had when we first games which is why I boasted about this place."}
{"text":"Food was good but service slow! It took a good 30 minutes for us to get our food which was all pho."}
{"text":"Not a place for Pho. Combination Pho ?c bit came with two 1/4 pieces of meat ball and several slices of beef. I have never been to  a place that serves special bowl that is so \"special\" where it lacks on everything. You don't have to take it from me. Just look at the picture(s) posting that others have posted. Ohh! If you are expecting a spring roll by definition, you wont find it here. They are so creative that they turn chicken into spring roll. Lol...Give this place a try and you will know what I meant. Last but not lease, I don't think they really have a kitchen because the cooker prepares food in general eating area.
NOTE:  THE 4 AND 5 STARS COULD POSSIBLY BEEN POSTED BY FRIENDS OR  FOREIGNER THAT HAVE NOT HAS THE BETTER EXPERIENCE OF VIETNAMESE'S FOOD.  NOW DON'T JUST BELIEVE MY POSTING, GIVE IT A TRY."}
{"text":"Took forever and pho usually does not take that long. The place is small and guaranteed you'll walk out of that place with a strong Asian food stuck onto your clothing. Expect to want to shower and wash your clothes after. 

Can't split the checks in any way. Not even partial cash and the rest card. So lame. Pho tasted kind of funky...servers always had to be flagged down. Will not be back. I'll take my chances on waiting at pho Kim long."}
{"text":"Ooooooo, this place is tight!  Not in a good way....I mean small, teeny weeny!  All the tables are so close together.  You can't hear yourself talk, it's so damn loud in there.  If you are hungry, better go somewhere else...the wait is pretty long if you go at the wrong time.

For the price you pay, it's a hole in the wall.  Kinda dirty and you will notice people walking back and forth, in and out, waiting for tables..to see who's done eating, if any tables are clear, so they can see how close they are to having a table.

The Bun Bo Hue is very good,  the eggrolls for $9 bucks appetizer...yeah no!  The rice plate for $12 bucks..yeah no too!  Oh hell no!

To come back here again?  I would have to be desperate..and for the price..I can get better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall! I love their spring rolls with pork sausage! I ordered short ribs with fried egg rolls and shrimp cake. I love everything about the food! Excellent customer service! No complaints!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the soup cure, I highly recommend this place! Pho Bosa is a little bit out of the strip, but definitely recommended if you're craving some Vietnamese food. The restaurant is located in a plaza with other businesses so there are plenty of parking. The restaurant is average sized and we didn't have to wait to get seated (which is awesome!) 

I had their spring rolls, Bun Rieu, and their sugar cane drink and everything really hit the spot. The Bun Rieu broth was really flavorful, and they didn't skimp out on the portion. Spring roll was super fresh and a serving was enough for four people to share as an appetizer. I rarely see the sugar cane drinks at a Vietnamese restaurant these days, so it was perfect for my after meal drink. It was really refreshing and not too sweet. I will definitely be going back when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I have ever had! Their iced coffee is to die for! I didn't know until I went there rice could be broken and IT CAN!!! So delicious! Now, it has become one of my go to places"}
{"text":"Loved this place, if you want great pho, you got it here, In fact everything was great.
Thank you Pho Bosa"}
{"text":"Nem Nuong Cuon: Grilled pork sausage, crispy wonton wrapper, pickled vegetables, shredded lettuce, all wrapped up in rice paper. Served with a great sweet and savory dipping sauce. These rolls are amazing. Even with a pork patty/sausage and fried wonton inside the roll, it still has the refreshing quality of light summer rolls because of the fresh vegetables. Great stuff.

#36 Cha Gio, Bi Cha, Suon Nuong ($10.99): Egg Rolls, Shredded Pork Loin, Egg Quiche, and Grilled Pork Chop. I'm a big fan of broken rice dishes because I love Jasmine rice and I dislike vermicelli noodles. I love Vietnamese grilled pork chop and this one was great. Also, yummy egg rolls. I didn't love the shredded pork or egg quiche though. The rice itself was fine, but not the best one I've had in town.

I would come here just for the Nem Nuong Cuon and other rolls, but otherwise, it's not particularly special. Lots of noodle soup options for those of you that like Pho, etc!"}
{"text":"Bun Rieu & spring rolls were delicious! The broken rice dish with short rib combo was okay. Iced coffee was strong & rich.. I'm guessing they used condensed milk. Good option if you're craving Vietnamese food. It's a short drive from Palazzo."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm pretty new to the world of Pho.   I'm gonna start with the service:

Service:
The service was OUTSTANDING!  We were three white people not familiar with Pho and our server went out of his way to really explain the purpose of all the flavors, the differences between Pho and the dish I ordered (Bun Bo Hue).  Plus, one of my friends was Vegetarian and one was allergic to seafood, so he went further out of his way to make sure all the ingredients fit with their situations.  

Food:
First I ordered the fried pork egg rolls.  They super delicious!  The server again mixed the sauces together for me (fish sauce & chili sauce) for dipping.  Then I realized half-way through eating the egg rolls was that I was eating them wrong.  I was eating them like a typical white person instead of realizing that the lettuce, herbs and veggies on the plate were meant to be used to wrap the egg rolls in.   At first we just thought it was really nice garnishes lol

Next I had the Bun Bo Hue.  One of the best broths I've ever tasted maybe ever.  I loved all the ingredients:  Brisket, Pork Sausage, Noodles, Cabbage and this Pork Blood thing.  

I have a list of Pho places bookmarked on here, but it's going to be hard to want to try anywhere else."}
{"text":"First of all let me say I live in orange county and Westminster is right next-door to me.  I see lots of reviews with four stars, to me there's no reason it deserves anything less than five.  Our waiter, Mo, is one of the few non-Vietnamese person (that I've ever known) who knows way more about Vietnamese food than a regular Vietnamese.  

Both my buddy and I ordered Phó Dac Biet, The broth is more on the sweet side, but then again if you have eaten over 100 Phó places like I have, you know that they all have their own recipes for the broth.  We ordered eggrolls, and dumplings and one hour fire came they were the large bowls that you expect with lots of fixings.  If you're tired I find dining on the strip, and you just need a bowl of authentic phó, you need to check this place out and ask for Mo."}
{"text":"Great services!!! Small resturant but pretty busy.  I been to alot of pho shop, and their workers ususlly don't come back to see if everything is ok after dropping off food. I would come again. Would be awesome if I got a bit more pork with my vermicelli salad."}
{"text":"I could come here and order 2 Cha Gio and some Pennywort juice and I'll be smiling for the rest of the night. I could end the meal there and be happy with it but there are so many more dishes on their menu. I am a big fan of all their vermicelli noodle dishes with a special preference to the Kalbi. 

A nice welcomed addition to the menu is the Pho. This was available back at the location on S. Jones. So far I have tried the Pho with the Beef Balls, Brisket, and the rare beef. All three have been a hit with me.

The service is always so friendly and accommodating. I am never left wanting when I am there.

After looking at the other review I've got a craving for some Bun bo Hue and Cha Gio. See you soon Pho Bosa!"}
{"text":"after a long night of partying, what better way to cure your hangover symptoms than a huge bowl of pho?

this place gives you the biggest bang for your buck, especially in vegas. it's located off the strip, (and it's a little difficult to find) so prices are so much better than if you were to eat closer to town. i paid $9 for a large (they only offer one size) and i didn't even finish my food. you're definitely not going to find that on the strip.

their cococane is a combination of sugarcane and coconut juice, two drinks that vietnamese people are known for, and it definitely didn't disappoint. it's $9, but they give you this huge cup with so many coconut shavings! it's great for the ride home, until you have to use the bathroom cuz you were drinking so much of it (LOL)!

I'm definitely coming here before every ride home. and the name is so punny!"}
{"text":"My first experience trying Vietnamese food and it was amazing. I enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the restaurant. And servers were wonderful, I absolute love when I go to a restaurant and the servers are knowledgeable about the food they are serving. You have my Five Stars, I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the Vegas area and they are looking for a Vietnamese restaurant, Pho Bosa is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Went there for lunch today around 11:30am, and we were the only customers. The bun rieu and bun bo hue had good flavor, but we felt that they were skimping on everything, even the plate of veggies for the noodle soups. Even the iced water tasted gross, so we ordered bottled water. I don't think it's worth returning!"}
{"text":"This is my to go spot for nem nuong rolls, com tam, and bun bo hue. What I like about the nem nuong is that it tastes really fresh with just the lettuce, meat, and that crunchy thing in there. They don't add any other fillers to make the roll thicker like some other places. The bun bo hue was really tasty but I would've liked it spicier. Not sure if they had spice on the side you can add in. The com tam [broken rice] is another favorite as well. The portions are decent in size and fills me up. I've also ordered pho togo one day from this place and they give you a lot! The cut of meat was thin and tender and broth tasted very clean. I recommend all my friends here for Vietnamese food. They do have a long wait time for food to come out though, so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"While I was here I had iced coffee, egg rolls, and chicken pho. The iced coffee was to die for. If you are a coffee lover, you HAVE to try Vietnamese coffee. The egg rolls and pho were also awesome. If you have not had pho, this seems like a good place to start. The staff was helpful and also gave us some tips on some local things to do off the strip. We are definitely planning on coming here every time we are in town"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch the other day and it was mediocre. Service was prompt by the staff.

Started off with the nem nuong cuon rolls with the warm pork sausage wrapped in vegetables and a crispy egg roll inside. The sauce was mediocre at best...

Moved on to the Bun Bo Hue which had a flavorful broth but the cuts of beef were quite rough and chewy... There was only a couple small pieces of meatloaf too :(

Their iced coffee was surprisingly decent and the highlight of the meal!

The interior of the restaurant was quite large and spacious, but quite minimal.

~$22/head after tax and gratuity"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4.5 but I rounded down due to poor ventilation and small space. The food is a 5 star rating from you.
Sorry Pho Kim Long, this is my new pho spot on Sunday morning!
PORK SPRING ROLLS: $5.5 is a must try here. The pork with the crispy fried wonton and their sauce is amazing!
The Bo Hun hue that my friend got was huge in portion and the broth was very flavorful, I would definitely give that a try next time."}
{"text":"This was just ok.  Nothing really special about them.  I ordered korean beef short robs combo that came with shredded pork loin, egg quiche,  and pork egg rolls.  Overall..just ok. The shredded pork was good but had a weird grain or texture that I couldn't figure out.  My boyfriend ordered beef pho...it was good. Thw soup had good flavor.
Not the best in town...my favorite is still Pho Saigon 8."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money here. I am all for supporting local businesses, but local businesses are supposed to care about their patrons unlike big chains, right?? 

The short lady did not look happy to see us upon our arrival; whatever. We sat down and were given two minutes to decide what to order. That's fine; we aren't new to Vietnamese foods; we knew what we want. 

I ordered the pho tai with meat on the side. My companions ordered the bun bo hue and the bun huen. One of my companions wanted their sprouts cooked and there was a slight language barrier because the short lady can barely speak understandable English; that's fine. That's how you know it's authentic, right? 

I checked in with yelp and was offered the $2.99 three color drink. I asked my companion if they wanted the same, and the lady, I kid you not, scowled that it's for one person only! Ok, ok... 

My pho tai arrived after about five minutes, with the meat on the side. Then my companion got theirs. I knew right away it was gonna be less bang for my buck. It was a big bowl of soup and very little noodle. The beef was not the best cut. The broth was nothing special; I really don't know what is so special about this place. 

My companions agreed their portions are significantly smaller than other restaurants and their prices are significantly higher. 

As we were presented the check, we noticed a $1 charge. We asked the lady what it was for and she said it was for the extra dish bc the pho tai was requested with the meat on the side. WHAT??!  I told her nowhere on the menu did it mention the surcharge and she said nothing about it when I ordered. 

I am not cheap but she could at least be a little nicer and explain the surcharge without scowling at us again! And I know it's not because of the language barrier. I have communicated with Thai in Thailand who spoke absolutely no English and I can tell their nicety through facial expressions and gestures. 

Overall, the food was sub par. The service is beyond terrible and the prices are too high for what it's worth. I will never recommend this restaurant and actually hope to steer my friends and fellow yelpers away from this place. 

And if you do go, don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa definitely fits the description of \"hole in the wall\" kind of joint, because the restaurant interior is small and feel constricted. The furniture look like they were bought from garage sale or flea market and the building looks kind of run-down. The look might scare some potential customer away. 

HOWEVER, once you tried their specialty \"Bun Bo Hue\", you will want to come back for more. I've lived in Vegas for 9 years and this place (on the average) still has the best Bun Bo Hue in town. Their other specialty is broken rice dishes (com tam), which is good but not exceptional. Their Pho is okay too, not bad.

Lately, I noticed food came out much faster than before. I believe they might have more staff in the kitchen and therefore reduced the time it takes for food to come out. 

FYI, they close on Wednesday and sometimes on other days too, so if you live far from this place, it's best to call ahead to make sure they open that day."}
{"text":"Probably the best bun bo hue in Vegas. Com tam is really good too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best pho I've ever had. I got the combo bowl which had meatballs, rare brisket and tendon. The tendon had a buttery texture that melted in your mouth. I was also impressed at the customer service as hole in the wall pho places are not usually known for their service. Our waters never went empty and the server checked up on us a few times. Definitely a great place to get pho off the strip."}
{"text":"Pho broth is ok here.  It's definitely better than the few we had been to in the last few weeks in our search for the best Pho spot in Las Vegas.  They do have amazing Nem Nuong Spring Rolls!!  Super freshly made!  We will swing by for some to go next time.  It reminds me of Dat Thanh in Westminster.   

I'm only giving them 4 stars, because of the service provided and for the Nem Nuong."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to Pho place but it just got better. Word has it that a smoker has been introduced to the kitchen which has allowed for smoked meat in the pho. This technological achievement instantly changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Just get the smoked oxtail pho. Then thank me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time trying this place and it's probably the best pho place I've tried in Vegas. Perfect hangover cure! This will definitely be my new go-to pho spot when I'm in Vegas. Pork spring rolls were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's Vegas, so there's not that too many bomb Vietnamese restaurants like in Little Saigon. However, I will say this is the best pho I've had in Vegas. The broth was flavorful and the sliced filet beef was great. The worker was also really nice and fixed my tea to how I want it with no complaint. I gave it a 4 star however because they didn't have spring rolls."}
{"text":"I came to try the bun bo hue. I ordered it with beef balls for extra $2. It was really good. I typically don't like the blood when I get it at other places but it actually had a good flavor. The tendon was nice and soft and the noodles were perfect texture. I would come back here. 
Service was friendly and attentive. I don't think the complaints regarding poor service are relevant. 
Only complaint are the prices. 
One bbh, 2 hot teas and the side of beef ball with tip was around $18 but I'll come here every once in a while."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 stars! Customer service was horrible, especially the lady that had an attitude problem. Took the staff forever to take our orders and to get our check."}
{"text":"Everything was good.  Bun Bo Hue was good all the way thru to the meat, proportion, and of course the broth.  

Order summer roll with nem noung was bomb just like broddards in OC.  It even comes with a similar sauce.  

The spring rolls great proportion comes with 5 rolls and lettuce, pickles and mint complimented the rolls. It usually doesn't come with all the extra stuff but was a great touch. 


Friend of mine got the Bun Rieu the crab tomato seafood soup which was great.  He was American and it was his first time having it and he loved it so that says a lot for someone who doesn't traditional eat Vietnamese food.  

Overall great experience will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pho in vegas by far!!! The servers are nice and polite. Generous portions and authentic viet flavors!!"}
{"text":"The menu is compact and small. Came here for dinner. The service was good, lots of vegetables. The chicken soup was good, but wished it had more meat though."}
{"text":"With so many options to choose from in Las Vegas, I'm glad I stopped in here. I used to live here and moved away, I'm back visiting family and trying to eat as much as possible because in Montana, there are no places to eat whatsoever.

I had been here before but to their old location. The nem nuong cuon is a must. I love the crunch inside. Normally I get the bun bo hue, but today I tried the com tam tau hu ky. It was delicious! Probably the best I've ever had, from California to Washington.

I also like to take some time to praise the customer service here. They are friendly, attentive, even funny at times. I will have to come here every time I'm in town and I will be drooling until then."}
{"text":"**0 star** Yelp wont left me leave it without star.

We came here for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7pm! Party of 4 and the staff sat us at a small table. We asked if we can sit on the bigger table and he told us that table is for 6 ppl and we only have 4. Uh- its so empty, why cant we sit there!?? HELLO!! 

Food is just an O-kay. We want to order an egg roll ($1.25), and the waitress said \"order the 5 pcs plate is cheaper\". Eh.. 5pcs for $9.99.(5x $1.25=$6.25) $6.25 vs $9.99, I think my math is really bad. How can it be cheaper??? 

Plus the Thai tea is $3 for a small cup and super sweet , blah~

Anyway, 2 out of 4 ppl got sick from the food.

Will I recommend this place? Umm-Hello~ its not going to happened. 

Not recommented at all."}
{"text":"I've learned that I write reviews more so to keep track of what I've had for future reference.  So here it goes


Service was fast.  Nem nuong rolls were good but regret scrolling thru yelp while dining here and discovering a Nem nuong bistro around the corner.  Pho ga in beef broth - broth was good and would suggest it to those who are yearning for a hangover cure. However the chicken was very tough. Overall served its purpose to coat my tummy after a night in Vegas that was filled with libations. 


Milk tea portion is generous and served in a to go cup."}
{"text":"I eat pho at least 3 days a week. This place is up there with my favorites!!!!!!! Defiantly worth trying!!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We ordered pho, spring roll and eggroll. Kinda hesitant at first coz the way they make it here is a lot different from LA where we came from, but were glad we did give it a try. Everything we ordered tasted really good, as in delicious! The place is not fancy but it is clean. The servers are nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the waitress greeted us with menus in hand. This place was a lot nicer than I expected. I guess they used to be elsewhere but moved to this location. A friend recommended Pho Bosa for its bun rieu (crab noodle soup) and bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup). Well, I tried the bun bo hue and was not disappointed. Legit, that's all I gotta say. Nem nuong cuon and com tam was pretty standard. Probably wouldn't order those again. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"BBH is legit!

The broth is super clean, comes out piping hot, and has just the right amount of spice! 

All the various meats within the soup are fresh and cooked as expected.  I like the pork goodness and getting \"squirelly\" by eating the blood!!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that this place is a gem of Las Vegas. In the area you will find many pho restaurant but none has topped the set-up of the restaurant.

This is my favorite pho spot!!!!!!! Service is great, food is great, and the nem nuong are to die for."}
{"text":"Visit: Sunday, June 17, 2018

Passed through Vegas on a road trip, so we decided to have some nice hot broth to keep us going on the long drive. It wasn't too busy, and we were seated and ordered pretty quickly. Once we stopped giggling at the posters advertising \"cococane\" juice, of course.

We all ordered the same thing: the combination pho. The meatballs and tendon were okay, but the brisket and steak tasted like liquid smoke, which was kind of off-putting. The smoke flavor leached into the broth, which wasn't great. The noodles were fine. The best part, though, was that the bowl was massive, and probably enough to feed two people. Good deal.

Service was fine. We were in and out pretty quickly, which was nice for us. Seems that the popular items here are the rice plates and sandwiches, which might explain why the pho wasn't all that great. Would consider returning when I am back in Vegas and wanting Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Odd location, it is next to a biker bar...and honestly doesn't even look like a restaurant from the outside, the complex itself looks like office building. The place isn't that big, but it can accommodate big parties and what not. From the outside to the inside, place looks boring, it honestly looks like the old ass restaurants you see on Restaurant: Impossible, where Robert Irvine has to pretty much go in there and tear it apart. So yes the restaurant looks boring, and yes it is the definition of a hole in the wall, so I'd assume the food was going to be great..but the pho was just pretty decent; I ordered the pho tai bo vien which comes with rare steak and beef balls. I like that the beef balls weren't tiny and that this place actually give quite a few, and the rare steak was actually rare steak. The broth was so so, wasn't superb, and wasn't shit, just ok. Orders come out slow, but they tell you that on a sign saying something about freshness and made to order.....then again, pho broth does take more than 20 mins to make and everything else; noodles, meat, veggies are all add ins so freshness is very vague lol."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it to take a trip off the strip to his up this small vietnamese joint.  The broken rice pork dish with quiche was one of the best vietnamese dishes I've ever had.   We even took a few extra orders to eat in our hotel room so we wouldn't have to drive back to spring mountain later in the evening.   Service was good, but just give them some time to prepare your food, it'll be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Def would come back to this place. The first time I went to Pho Bosa I was skeptical of the outside and did not come in. Boy do I wish I can take that moment back. The broth was very good! I had the bun rieu and my family members had pho and bun bo hue. All three broths were very good! Portions are huge! So you can easily share if you felt like it."}
{"text":"The sign outside and the overall looks of the outside don't really do justice with this spot. 
Small place, very intimate and the most important thing extremely tasty. 
I had couple of dishes. 
Short ribs and broken rice.
Grilled chicken with broken rice.
Bun bo hue. 
Egg rolls (surprisingly and luckily they were chicken egg rolls). 
Every dish was spot on! 
Tasty, lots of flavors, meat was marinated really well, friendly staff.
Great spot! 
Don't judge it by the sign outside, just go inside at enjoy a great viet meal. 

Trust me. I know food."}
{"text":"Bosa 1 is back as a
 reincarnated Pho Bosa. Apparently, they moved to be closer to the strip and included pho to please customers top 2 requests. 

Plates have always been the star for both the BF and me. They changed the way the plates are so there is more customization on the items you have in your combo whereas it used to be set items aside from the main meat dish. We both got plates with shrimp cake and eggrolls and I picked grilled pork sausages and the BF got BBQ pork. Everything good, as expected. It's the best broken rice plate you're going to get in Vegas. I wish they bottled their seasoned fish sauce! It is clean and balanced and I want to douse it on everything. They're doing a free soda with a Yelp check-in and that was oddly the only bump in the visit. It was flat and odd tasting according to the BF who ordered a coke.

Service is just as friendly and attentive which I have come to expect when you go to eat at Bosa. It's one of the few Asian establishments that have amazing service. 

It's easily missed when driving by it. If you see the Bikini Bar it is next to it and the Zombie Apocalypse store is across the street on Polaris.

Course, now that the namesake is Pho I have to come back (very soon, I hope) to try this and indulge and their two other soups: Bun Rieu and Bun Bo Bue. Perfectly in time for the cool down in weather!"}
{"text":"Pork spring rolls are soooooo yum!!

Pho was also on point. We ordered the lemongrass one & a combination..

Super yummy and really good serving portion"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas, saw this place had 4 stars so stopped in for a quick bite.  Their signature dish is bun bo hue, which is one of my absolute favorite dishes.  I'm originally from northern Virginia, where they know how to do it right.  So, this place has a lot of learning to do when it comes to vietnamese spices.  The bun bo hue lacked so much flavor- it tasted like salted brown water with red coloring floating on top.  The blood cake tasted not right.  I asked the server why it was sooo bland and he said there's separate seasoning they add when they serve it, like in the vietnamese region of hue. Well heck, I ordered bun bo hue, not watered down whatever it is you served me.  My husband had a rice dish with egg rolls, shrimp cake and nem. He said the shrimp cake was good but the nem (pork sausage) had zero flavor.  We live in Hawaii and were hoping for some great VN food in LV but this place was disappointing.  We always want to support local hole in wall eateries.  Work on your spices and seasonings, Pho Bosa.  We might try you again next time, but probably not."}
{"text":"This pho place located in a hidden corner of a apartment complex. haha it took us a while to figure out the entrance, since there was no sign, and the windows were tinted. 

Waiting 3/5: I would've given them a 2 out of 5, but since they DID put up a sign saying that since all their food are freshly made, there's usually a 10-20 minutes wait for your food. and IT'S TRUE! lol, their honesty made me giggled. i waited for about 25 minutes for my food haha, i cannot complain because they DID warned me and I decided to stay.. haha.

food 3.5/5: It's not bad, but i've had better. we ordered a spring roll, beef ball pho and one of their combination broken rice dish. Everything is very decent tasting, nothing too bad; I admit i was a bit disappointed since i waited for 25 minutes for this \"freshly made\" food.

Service 3/5: Overall is good; perhaps there's a bit short staffs? I only saw one waiter out at the dinning area helping about 12 tables of customers. So their service may not as promptly as it could be. 

Im a very impatient person, i WOULD'VE CAME BACK if the waiting time is not that long. but yeah, i just cant stand the wait, i'd rather go pho king long."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 5 for my bachelorette party. We needed Pho for the hangover recovery magic . The server was awesome and recommended places to visit in Vegas. Appetizers and PHO was the bomb. Super chill atmosphere and loved the country music playing in the background. Aloha from Hawaii!!!!"}
{"text":"Always looking to try a new pho spot I was pretty excited and sure I would love this place from reviews and recommendations. Sadly I was let down. First off the location is kind of odd. It sits in a random strip mall with a bar next to it in the beginning of China town away from all the other restaurants, also the bathroom is located outside which can be kind of annoying especially in the summer. Everyone says the pork sausage rolls are good so we ordered those along with Pho Tai for me and Bun Bo Hue for my love. 

The Nem Nuong Rolls were really good and they had a good crunch to them. The sauce it was served with disagreed with my tastebuds and was not appetizing. My pho tai broth was not good either. The broth tasted really different. Not a different taste that I enjoyed. Even after adding plenty of line the broth was just weird. I don't know how to explain lol. I didn't however enjoy the meat they out in. Tasted like good quality and they have a good portion of both rare steak and noodle. My fiancé enjoyed his bun bo hue but it wasn't his favorite either. Overall this place is ok but not my favorite pho place. The spring rolls saved this meal but it's not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Somewhere along the line, I believe I yelped this place before. But they have since moved to a newer location on polaris road, very near to my workplace. Why I havent visited this place for a while. Dont ask me.

But, they do have the best nem nuong in las vegas. Me and my wife stopped by because she was craving some good pho. I told her, look, we always go to pho kim long, lets try something new.

We came in and somehow this place look familiar. Apparently they moved from their spring mountain and jones area. So we sat down and talk to moses the friendly server who knows all his craft and roundabout on vietnamese food. 

We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our conversation with moses since he is a food connoiseur like us. Their food are great. I would definetely be back soon."}
{"text":"\"Dude, you stink.  No time for a shower?\" says my Mid West, non Asian poker bud as he gets into the car.

\"What the?!?\" I take personal hygiene seriously unlike the average poker player.

\"Yeah, you smell like an Asian; 'lemongrassy'.\" he continues and laughs.

\"You can get out and walk you know\".  OK so it was true that I just finished one of Pho Bosa's  delicious specialties, Bun Bo Hue, a spicy bowl of collagen laced, beef, lemongrass noodle soup with ginger infused pork blood cake, melting beef tendons, well braised shank, topped with  raw onions, unusual herbs, and the zing of lime.  The perfect balance of sweet, sour, savory, spicy.

Not to be overshadowed, the Bun Rieu (Shrimp and crab soup with vermicelli rice noodles).  Complex flavors from fermented fish sauce, a concentrated chicken broth and shrimp stock,  acidic kick of tomatoes, vibrancy from cilantro, bitterness of green onions and fried tofu for body.  It's just good eats.

Com Tam (broken rice) plates are interesting.  Remember, this is Southeast Asian cooking, everything is overcooked by American standards.  Choose the sides (good egg roll, rubbery quiche and shrimp cake) and a meat (deeply marinated Korean style short ribs, dry pork chop, thin slices of soft beef, flavorful grilled chicken).  Done.  The rice itself is different texturally thanks to smaller grains cooking faster than unbroken grains and starch being released throughout.  Definitely worth a try.

Finally the pho.  A powerhouse of heavily extracted beef flavor and spices.  Heavy mouth feel.  Excellent.

Typical Asian service (you know what I mean).  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not a bad pho place in Chinatown, Las Vegas.  It's in the middle of a office building complex, so it's not that easy to find.  Of course, I ordered the pho.

The good: very strong beefy flavor, very generous portions of beef, double than other pho places, beef very sliced very thin and was tender.

The bad: a bit on the salty side, the spice flavor was very subtle (star anise, cinnamon, etc.) which was probably overwhelmed by the beef flavor.  Price was a bit higher and it takes a little longer for the food to come out.

If you like pho with a strong beef flavor, this is your place."}
{"text":"I ordered the crab noodle it was very bland and the beef pho tasted like it was made with hot water.  The tables were sticky to the touch, yuk.  We definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Oh wow! This is the best pho place. Excellent service which is not to be expected from pho joints generally. Yummy food. Price cheap!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is still the best Pho I can find in Vegas thus far. I've tried a few of the big names too, I always come back to this spot.

The appetizers are amazing as well. I can't speak for most of them as I only get the Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls. Love them both to death.

I also really like the new restaurant as it's much larger than the previous one. The place they've re-located to, feels a bit shady but regardless the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Even though the food is amazing, inconsistency with the hours are very inconvenient. I don't like going there on days where they're supposed to be open, and they aren't."}
{"text":"Already my favorite Vietnamese Pho in town for years, I've been enjoying the new menu items and culinary exploration that seems to have come hand in hand with the newer location near Valley View and Twain.

Taking the most flavorful Pho broth and trying to better something that \"isn't broken,\" I'm glad to say that the \"smokey broth\" options here have ruined my desire to eat \"plain\" pho ever again lol.

They have a few variants, but the Smoked Oxtail Pho is highly recommended!  Literal smoked broth, highly peppery with just the right amount of oil!  The Oxtail itself full of flavor, well peppered and tender.  The cartilage and fat rendered to remind one of a glorious bone marrow, highly edible and decadent.  Such a diverse dish with layers of depth in each bite.  Easily the best Oxtail AND Pho I've had thus far :)

And now they've expanded the menu once again, to include my go-to choice for sandwiches, the Banh Mi Thit Nuong / Charbroiled Pork Sandwich.  Excellent bread, airy and buttery soft, with a garlicky aioli spread and the best charbroiled pork in town!  Now with the new menu options, I have no excuse to eat Vietnamese food anywhere else in town lol 

If you haven't tried Bosa yet, you're in for a treat.  Just don't be surprised if the \"smokey pho\" lives up to the hype ;)"}
{"text":"I love their  pho since I'm from Seattle with alot of great pho places this soup was on  point. Love the flavor of the soup. The service was excellent and very fast. If you're ever in Vegas and need that hangover cure go there and it's not to far from the strip."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Pho Bosa when we first moved to Las Vegas. It was close to where we were staying, it was absolutely delicious, and we got lots of food for a relatively low price. Also, Vanessa and Moe are very friendly and we love coming by to say hi to them. They were the first nice locals we met in Las Vegas.

I ate a lot of pho during the hottest months of the summer, which is another testament to how good the food is. If it's over a hundred degrees outside and I'm still ordering hot soup, it has to be pretty exceptional! 
We live further away from Chinatown now and don't have Vietnamese food nearly as often, but once I tasted it here, I couldn't bring myself to go anywhere else. I really want to explore the menu and I have branched out from time to time, nothing has ever disappointed me. 

What keeps me coming back is Vanessa's pho broth! I have never in my life tasted a more amazing pho broth. It is the perfect comfort food. When I am sick and craving my mom's food, I get some of their spicy pho and it always helps me feel better. I could drink a whole bowl of it with nothing added in, but it only gets better with more ingredients. They put a generous amount of meat and noodles and broth in there each time, I feel like they've got the ratio just right. I never feel like they skimp on anything.

 I always get my pho with rare sliced beef, and with egg rolls in the fish sauce. The egg rolls are the perfect compliment to the savory broth. All the vegetables are fresh, and so is the meat. I'm really picky about the meat I eat, especially red meat, but I love all the different meats they serve here (I've had beef and pork). 

The service is friendly, the food comes out to you reasonably fast, and I split my order with my boyfriend, but when we finish we are both full! I love this place and can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking and lack of sleep, pho would be the ideal food to turn to. I checked on yelp and this place had the best ratings, so we decided to check this place out. Pho Bosa is in chinatown, so a taxi ride is required. Make sure you get the taxi companies number so you can get a ride back because flagging down a taxi is quite difficult in the area. It's a fairly small location, so if you have a big party, be prepared.

Luckily we didn't have to wait. They have a huge selection for you, whether it's pho or rice plates, as well as a lot of different drinks. I always go for the coconut juice since it's helps a lot after a long night. You get the drink in a REAL coconut, and you can eat the insides when you're done. The first time, I ordered the BBH (Bun Bo Hue), it was alright. It taste a little different from what I'm use to but overall it tasted good. You get pork blood and the knuckle along with everyone else that's suppose to be in BBH. Other time, I got the pho dac biet, combination pho. The large is fairly small for a large, but it was a decent serving size considering I couldn't really devour anything. I've definitely had better pho..

Overall this is a decent place. Maybe next time I'll try some of the rice plates because they look delicious."}
{"text":"I will say this is my new favorite place it was recommended by my barber. I was thrown off by how the servers spoke very good English and weren't Asian btw.. lol it didn't matter though the food is good.

My fave is the nem neuong spring rolls! 
Pho was also great broth wasn't all filled with msg or oily but still savory
Broken rice dish was also really good. 

I recommend this place to anyone that wants a solid meal I'll be going back there tonight actually so good!"}
{"text":"We tried to go to Pho Kim Luong but the wait was too long and we needed an immediate hangover cure. 

Pho Bosa was recommended by my friend who lives in LV. Great service and GREAT pho (tons of meat). The spring rolls were so good (minus the cilantro) and if you check in on yelp you get a free dessert!"}
{"text":"Better than most Vietnamese restaurant in Westminster. Their pork spring rolls are so delicious.  My kids can't get enough of it.."}
{"text":"The outside of this place looked like it the food was going to taste like crap.  The outside of the building was such a turnoff that I wanted to leave.  What made me change my mind was the reviews and ratings.  I am glad we didn't leave.  My friends and I ordered #72-74.  Our pho bowls were all pretty similar.  They consisted of rare steak, fish balls, and other meats.  Every dish was really really good.  I was amazed.  The bowls were huge too.  Large sized.  There was so much noodles in our bowls.  We ate until we were suffed to the max.  

You can also tell if a place is good if the place is packed and there's a waiting list.  This place had both!  Totally wasn't not a disappointment."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 9 on a Saturday night. It's a bit out of the way so we drove/took a taxi there.

Pretty good for Vegas but I can get pho better than this anywhere back home. I wish there was more fatty flank. Broth was pretty good.

We got various types of spring rolls, some with sausage, some fried vegetarian. These were also pretty decent.

I also got an iced Vietnamese coffee that was decent. For some reason the restroom is located outside the restaurant around the back."}
{"text":"So I came across this place because yelp said this one of the best rated pho places in LV. When I rolled up to this joint, it was sooo sketchy looking. The parking was pitch black, no light poles in the parking lot. The restaurant itself was all covered up so no light from the inside would bleed out. So, I thought it was closed! My family and I kicked my brother out of the car to check if it was open, and when he opened the door and light bled out of the restaurant, we knew it was open. After being seated by kind employees, I ordered a Pho Tai.

Pho should always be judged on three things-- broth, noodles, meat.
Broth was 5/5, meat was 4/5 because there weren't enough meat with the noodle ratio (I had like a solid 6 piece of pho Tai mean pieces) but the tenderness of the meat was nice. The only small issue I had with the noodles was that it was slightly harder than other pho noodles I've encountered. Portion is HUGE. Thus, 4/5.

 The service was really, really good. Everyone was nice and polite."}
{"text":"We ended up here on happenstance because the first pho joint we stopped at was packed and the staff was SUPER rude.  So we drove down the street and found Pho Bosa -- best decision ever.  We liked it so much, we ate here on the first day coming in AND on the last day leaving Vegas.  (Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you!)

The pho broth here may be the most flavorful I have ever had.  So savory, packed with so much seasoning and tang.  I did a few squirts of Hoisin sauce and Sriracha sauce just out of habit but it was utterly unnecessary.  The soup just stood on its own.  Pho noodles were beautifully cooked, meat was lean, lender and fresh.  My only compliant was that I got to the bottom of the bowl too quickly, and I'm pretty sure the portions are on par with everywhere else.  We also got egg rolls and this spring roll with Vietnamese sausage and dipping sauce.  SO GOOD!  I'm totally salivating while typing this.  

I have eaten a lot of pho at a lot of places.  Mainly in Los Angeles where Vietnamese cuisine is competitive.  Pho Bosa is up there with the best of them."}
{"text":"pretty good Viet  food. Skip their new cococaine drink - flavorless, tey still need to work on their recipe ratio, nothing like nc mía Vit ?ông, stick with just sugar cane it's great. Their cam tam is good and bun Rieu pretty okay. Chao gio tom (shrimp) is good but way over priced at $11!  nem cuon is okay, nothing special, similar to Brodard but nem is less flavoured. Yes we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Beware of this place Bc this is the only Vietnamese place that adds an auto gratuity for a party of 5. The worst part is that they included our two kids which are the age of 4 and 1 . I've never been to an establishment where they add kids to it ."}
{"text":"After a long weekend in Vegas, my husband wanted to grab some good Pho before heading home. So we do what we usually do and yelp a place. Pho Bosa popped up with a decent amount of reviews, both mixed with 5 stars and 1/2's. 

I'm always the type of person to try a place even though it has a couple of OK reviews, just for my own opinion.

Presentation: Small little mom and pop joint. Not the nicest place but, this is what I imagine what mom and pop stops look like.

Wait: We were seated immediately. It took us about 5-10 minutes to look at the menu before we ordered.

Customer Service: The customer service deserves a 5 Star. The waiter was fast with water refills, persistent, and did his job well. 

Food: I was a little disappointed in their Pho Dac Biet. Which is the original pho that comes with tendon, brisket, meatballs, meat etc., you know.. the usual. The meat was tough, and the texture was over cooked, the broth was.. just not good. The best part of it was the meatballs. My husband ordered one as well with some spring rolls and let me tell you, those were DELICIOUS. I'll definitely come back for those, and probably try something new!

Overall: I wouldn't get the Pho, But I would definitely come back for the spring rolls and willing to try a new soup!"}
{"text":"The egg rolls were subtle and very much unlike what you may find at other Vietnamese places. I really like how fresh the vegetables that accompanied the egg rolls are. In addition to the appetizer, we also ordered Pho and a rice plate. The pho broth was flavorful and aromatic while the noodles were just the perfect size and texture. The only thing I didn't like was that the broth was a bit too salty.

There wasn't much of a decor or atmosphere but the staff was very nice.

I will definitely come back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very good authentic pho.  Home made fish sauce and awesome spring rolls.  I'd say one of the best pho places near vegas."}
{"text":"Bun Bo hue.  Killer. Rolls awesome. Pork chops are frigging delish.

I love a great bowl of steaming soupy goodness.  this by far had the best broth in Vegas.  It might even be the cleanest I have ever eaten.  The beef knee is so tender and has wonderful collagen chewiness.

If you have a huge night and are really hungover have the pho or even better get the Bun Bo Hue with the rice noodles.  So good it hurts me that this is so far away."}
{"text":"I had a bun with Korean rib and egg rolls,  so good and clean. Vegetable was fresh and peanuts were freshly toasted. My husband had a pho and broth was really good and rich. Great place to stop by if you're craving for pho."}
{"text":"Located on the side of the orange-ish strip mall across the street from Zombie Apocalypse is this wonderful place for pho. We were welcomed with a smile as soon as we walked in.

We got a #74 pho tai, a #76 bun bo hue and a side of grilled pork. The tea here tastes much better than the other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Their noodle soup bowls here are huuuuge. Just like any other place, you get a plate of bean sprouts, lime wedges, basil and jalapeno

Pho Tai:
Rice noodle (vermicelli) soup with rare steak. I like to put Hoisin sauce, 2 slices of jalapeno and juice from a lime wedge on my pho. The broth was tasty and LOTS of meat. I love it! 5/5

Bun Bo Hue:
Spicy beef noodle soup with beef shank, cubes of cooked pork blood with ginger, pork, lemon grass broth. Think Tom Yum soup from a Thai restaurant but way spicier.  I've had this many years ago but the pork blood and spiciness of this soup scared the heck out of me. Their version tastes better and \"cleaner\" although I'm still scared of pork blood. This is actually a very good soup. My friend loves spicy food and even he thinks this was real spicy. 5/5

I can't complain about the service. The servers were very attentive and they're always asking \"you guy do ok?\" OK! Just make sure you call first before coming here, we were supposed to be here a few days before but for some reason, they were closed even if they were supposed to be open according to the days/hours outside the door and on their Yelp page."}
{"text":"Food isn't a 2 stars it's more of a 3.5 maybe even 4 stars but be prepared to wait for it.

The restaurant even addresses the issue of their long wait with signs on the wall that say 'our food is made fresh and may take 10-20 minutes to come out. Wait time may be doubled if busy\"

Trust me they're not kidding. Our food took about 35 minutes. For two bowls of pho and spring rolls? .. really? I yelped this place while I was in Vegas because I suspected phoking long would have a really long line so I decided to go somewhere else. If I knew I would be waiting 40 minutes for a bowl of pho I might as well just have gone to phoking long -_- 

Spring rolls are good. Large pho doesn't have that much noodles in it.

I suppose I'm supposed to give them credit for posting a disclaimer but they don't post it on the door of the entrance, you can't see it until you actually sit down. And who expects a bowl of pho to take THAT LONG! 

Oh on top of that they forgot my order of spring rolls. The restaurant really isn't big at all probably just 15 tables and they have 2-3 servers. 

Ehh not coming back, don't care how good the food is.. which is really not that amazing as their sign on the wall claims."}
{"text":"Sketchy ass location with bomb ass customer service and bomb ass food. Who cares if your car gets keyed while you're slurping down your delicious bowl of pho. :)

We randomly swung into this pho restaurant one late afternoon while we were in Vegas for the 2013 Olympia Expo. Upon parking and walking in, you seriously feel like you're either gonna catch an STD or probably shot up but rest assured, neither of the two happened to us. :)

Even though the interior is dark, dreary, run-down, surprisingly the scary restroom located outside the restaurant was uber clean. Haha!

I ordered a nice big bowl of Bun Rieu cuz I wasn't in the mood for pho. Have to admit, one of the best damn bowls of Bun Rieu I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant. The SBBF ordered himself some pho and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.

Customer service was on point. I like the fact that there was some random Hispanic guy who spoke perfect English who greeted us goodbye after we paid. 

Definitely a must-go if you want cheap, good Vietnamese food near the strip!"}
{"text":"This place would be an instant 5 star because of their delicious food but had to knock off 1 star due to random closings. For a total of 5 visits they were closed for 3 of them with a sign on the door stating they've ran out of food. That is however the only negative thing I have to say about this place. 

Bosa is definitely a hidden gem, has all the appearance qualities of a hole in the wall joint. The pho here is actually not great but all the rice dishes and other soup dishes are hands down the best in the area. 

For starters the pork egg rolls are my go to, they're very similar to the famous broddards in LA with a little less crunch. 

I typically order the bun bo hue and/or the pork/rice dish with Chinese sausage. The broth in the bun bo hue is extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spice and the thick noodles are cooked to a good texture. Also a small but important part of the experience that bosa does well is the quality of their side condiments like the cilantro and limes. They are very fresh and the limes aren't dried out like a lot of places. 

Overall, the food here is done correct, they just need to stop closing in the middle of the day! Nevertheless, I'll be back to roll the dice again!"}
{"text":"Pho has been my favorite food since the late 90's. I probably have had pho in over 20 different restaurants over the years, and it really varies from place to place. 

I can honestly say that I've had one of the best bowls of pho at Pho Bosa. The only other place which is in the same league as Pho Bosa is Pho So in Richmond VA. The soup, noodles, thin slices of eye of round steak, vegetables, everything was top-notch. 

Don't worry about the sketchy location. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very authentic Vietnamese food especially around the Vegas area, affordable and the Thai tea is amazing!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. This place is in a creepy motel lot? I was really sick and needed some pho. A good bowl of pho could cure a common cold, or at least, hasten the process.  How I wished for a good bowl of pho.  Hubby was looking forward to bun bo hue, their specialty. We got there before 7pm and they were sold out.  Okay. we ordered  pho and bun rieu. Pho lacked the beefy flavor and heavy on the cinnamon and anise. The bun rieu was good. Really good that my girl even liked it, and she doesn't like crab. That's saying a lot. The service was good. I would go back for bun rieu."}
{"text":"They have the best Bun Rieu hands down! I thought it was a small family run business, but I guess they have a couple other restaurants in the Viet community of Westminster or Garden Groove. I hear they're expanding and moving into a casino or something. Good on them! I just hope the personable people that work there keep the atmosphere polite and humble as they have been. I'm happy for their success."}
{"text":"Best hangover food ever! 
Food: My favorite thing here is their spring rolls. The ratio of meat to veggie to wrap is perfect and the flavor of the meat is right on point. The sauce is also delicious. I always add a little chili to it and keep it as a dipping sauce for the meat from my pho. The pho is good quality. The broth is well seasoned and really soothing to your stomach. I always get the combination which comes with tendons that are perfectly tender and a few different kinds of meat. They have big portions. I can never finish my $8 bowl.
They also have really good Vietnamese coffee. The one with condensed milk is like a dessert, sweet and rich. I always get the black coffee which has sugar but is not as heavy.
Service: The servers always look friendly and the food comes decently fast. Even though there was a line when we got there around noon it went fairly quickly and we were seated after just a 15-20min wait.
Location: The restaurant is in a small kind of dingy plaza off the strip. There's plenty of parking and it's not as crowded as some of the other popular food places.
Pho Bosa is a great choice of you're on you're way out of Vegas after a weekend of clubbing."}
{"text":"Great BUN BO HUE for Vegas!! I usually have m COM Tam and my hubby has his Bun and both are DELICIOUS!!! Best Asian place in Vegas!! They move to a bigger place. This place is a million times BETTER than Kim Long for pho, bin, com, everything but too bad they don't open 24hrs otherwise they would put Kim Long out of business. Soups are perfectedLy flavored, rice portions are Huge!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so good but the location is so bad. Love their bun bo hue so good. Well known for it. We enjoy it every time.  Chef came out and gave me a special on the house."}
{"text":"Awesome pho place away from home. The new regular place for me when in Vegas. Coffee is AMAZING here!!!"}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is goood!! Good little steak with rice and egg roll was food too. Everything  was is good including the coffee and fruit flavor tea!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. I decided to try a different place based on Yelp reviews. We usually frequent Pho Kinh Do or even Pho Kim Long.

Our order: Pho Dac Biet, Bun Bo Hue and Com Tam Tau Hu Ky Bo Nuong. 

The pho soup base was diluted. The beef in the Bun Bo Hue were such huge chunky pieces. Some were tender and others were tough. The broth is not bad. For a large bowl I got two itty bitty cubes of pork's blood. My husband said the rice place wasn't good and I believe him because he didn't finish it. He said the baked egg tasted rubbery and the slices of beef were more like teriyaki than having that grilled flavor. The tau hu ky was not bad...crispy. 

Note: All noodle soups are large only. 
Small place, decent service. It's almost right off the 15 when you exit...away from the center if Chinatown."}
{"text":"Amazing pho about 10 mins by car from the Strip. The portion sizes are HUGE, the broth is so hearty and flavorful I almost teared up. I got the #7 and the  bowl was good enough for two full meals. They also have this chili sauce I've never had that was so amazing . Their banh mis are the BEST I've ever had and came out super quickly. The only negative thing I have to say was that we had to wait 15-20 mins for our soup which might've been the longest I've ever had to wait for pho. They also seemed pretty understaffed, I had to hunt down waiters to get our check. It was definitely worth the wait but they should add one or two more waitresses or chefs to speed up the process because a lot of people in the restaurant were waiting for a while too. Still 10/10 would recommend because the food is that good but I do wish it was quicker."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.
Yum !Yum!
When your in Vegas try it!!
Love the coffee with sweet milk!!"}
{"text":"I ordered #70 combination pho and it was delicious. Although it was oily, I just scooped it out with a spoon and dump the fat in the mini dish given to put sauce on. The pho noodles only came in 1 size bowl (large) plus there was a lot meat, Which is a plus for me. The service was awesome and server was very nice and was present when you needed him. I also tried the iced coffee with milk and it was, too, delicious. I would come here again if I want some Vietnamese noodles."}
{"text":"Came in after a night of partying and there's nothing better than a big bowl of hot pho to bring you back to life. The place was nice and clean. Prices for appetizers were bit expensive but pho prices were good. 

The pho looked great and the broth was tasty. It passed the initial spoonful of soup before I add all my fixings. However, noodles weren't cooked enough and the meat had a weird taste. 

Service was ok. Overall, my experience was okay. I've definitely had better. It was honestly a sort of let down. I got high standards because of Saigon Bistro in Concord!

Would I be back? I don't think so. I would like to try different pho spots when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Despite being located in a somewhat shady looking strip plaza in Chinatown, Pho Bosa is definitely a solid option for pho if you happen to be in the area. It's not that far off the Strip and is just like a 10 min taxi ride. It's not a huge establishment, so be prepared to wait for a bit. The pho is not standout good, but is still good enough, and the soup is flavourful without being too salty. They have hands down the best Vietnamese coffee I've ever had though - rich in flavour, not overly sweet with too much condensed milk, and not a scarily vibrant shade of orange. Fantastic. We also grabbed a vermicelli and rice dish to go, and both were great and flavourful and came loaded with lots of pork, spring rolls, etc. There was a guy working there at the front (the owner?) who was super cool and friendly, easy to talk to, and he was nice about letting us just loiter around inside while we waited ages for our taxi to come. Definitely worth checking out, I'll probably be back next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would give ths place 4.5 stars. Went here today on my lunch break from work. I am new in town and didn't have trouble finding it. 

I did a take out order, it was ready within about 10 minutes from my call. The staff was friendly from the phone to the time I left with my food.

Generous portion, nice flavors and a lot of steak in the pho which was nice and the meat was tender. A lot of places skimp on the steak.

My only critique (otherwise it would've been 5 stars) would be I needed more lime. I am a big fan of the flavor of lime in my soup and I only got one slice which just wasn't enough. 

I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Minimum wait after order is about 15 mins and most expensive pho place ever. Egg toll-free$8.99- Noodle about  $12.00. Taste so so. Very very small place. There are many other places than here, go to other place."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday around 11am. We were seated and received our food quite fast. #77 on the menu was amazing and full of flavor. We got the crunchy spring rolls and those did not dissapoint :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came came in looking for great PHO and we sure did, the flavor was right on the nail! I ordered a Chicken PHO and my friend ordered a raw steak PHO with Tofu and a coke, I ordered their Sugar Cane and coconut drink! All I can say is OMG so delicious enough sweetness and super refreshing kind of pricy the drink was $10 more than the PHO but all came out to $36"}
{"text":"Best Pho soup in town, by far. Service is excellent, always willing to accommodate a large party. Order is out before you know it."}
{"text":"It's ok pho. Not much ingredients and broth pretty plain but overall ok. Service not good, won't even separate our tab."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bun Bo Hue which was excellent. So good!!! A bit pricey at $12 but thems Vegas prices for ya. Portions are generous though and all the pho bowls have a ton of meat. The meat is cooked very nicely and beef was super tender. It's totally worth it though and the drinks are nice too! 

The server was so nice and attentive too. Everyone in our party was happy with what they ordered. One person had ordered a bun bowl which was also super yummy.

Highly recommend this place to everyone and I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the food.  The reason is simple.  While waiting to be served, I asked one of the waiters to explain the items on the menu.  The response that I got was, \"are you stupid?, can't you read it yourself?  I am too busy to serve you\"

For this reason, I left this hole in the wall place with disgust, and as I was leaving, the waiter shouted, \"GOOD LUCK to you\""}
{"text":"Perfect choice! Upon arriving to Vegas on a cold Friday, my friend and I decided to venture off the strip and search for this Pho place-- it has been the best meal so far. Prices are affordable, less than $9 for a huge bowl of Pho. The chicken spring rolls were delicious too! 
Service was great and our server was very friendly (forgot name) sorry. We had an amazing conversation about his upbringing and travels. I love that in America we can eat Pho and have a wonderful conversation about the world. 

Definitely coming back when in Vegas! 
No crowds or overpriced meals."}
{"text":"Do not come here.  

I was in vegas for our family trip and my family always insists on getting Vietnamese food, despite all the other food to choose from in vegas.  We yelped a pho place, but it was closed down so we found ourselves at Pho Bosa.

When we entered the restaurant we were rudely greeted and said we would have to wait for a seat in their small and dirty restaurant.  When we were seated the waitress was also rude to us as well.  To make things worse, they have these signs on their walls that basically states you are not in a fast food restaurant so be patient for your food.  Obviously, if you are at a restaurant there will be a wait and it's pretty unnecessary for them to post that sign.

I ordered bun bo hue which was decent for vegas.  

The gentleman that came to bus our tables after we ate and he asked me if I like my bun bo hue with a native tone and it confused me for a bit because he didn't look Vietnamese.   In any case, wish we encountered him earlier because he was friendlier than the rest of the people that work there."}
{"text":"I'm not much for hyperbole but Pho Bosa has the best broken rice BBQ pork dish I've ever had. It was so good that most of my plate was eaten by others at the table. Great flavor in rhe meat and where else can you get the shrimp cake? 

And it's the little things that make this our new go-to spot for Vietnamese food:
- Each table has its own fish sauce so you can serve yourself as much as you want.
- They provide you with small scissors to cut your veggies or rolls as you wish.
- Friendly service with a smile and pride in their food.

Full of Vietnamese people so you know they're doing something right. Wash it down with some excellent Thai iced tea and I'm in heaven. Funky location in an odd strip mall near apartment complexes, but I see no reason to go anywhere else at this point. Loved it."}
{"text":"best spot in town for spicy beef noodle soup and combination plate of broken rice w choices of meat. The owner is very friendly n take good care of us every time we dine there. would def recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue rating: 3/5 

Based off the pictures, it looked delicious and mouth watering. In reality, the soup was watered down and disappointing. I shouldn't have overhyped the dish prior to tasting it :( 

The food was brought out quickly, so that's nice :)"}
{"text":"Also love love the vermicelli noodle bowl with fried egg rolls and BBQ chicken. The chicken is so tender and succulent with perfect grilled flavor and in the veggies they add a little something special that other places don't - maybe shiso leaves chopped up finely with the lettuce? So smacking good!  Umami!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! I've only had to walk-out of a restaurant twice in my adulthood and this was one place I'll never forget. 

It's a given! Pho is a great hangover remedy, my friends and I visited pho bosa cause per Yelp, it was new and had great ratings. We had a large party and was immediately greeted by:

\"You guys CANT sit together at one table but I still have to charge you the gratuity\"

I was already agitated by their welcoming greeting, and after I politely asked why, the waiter forced me to speak to the owner, I'm fine with that. However, the owner was the one who went overboard. 

He exclaimed his frustration about my disagreement to pay the group gratuity even though we sat separately. Usually when you have big groups, you want them on separate checks to speed up the service. The disgruntled owner had the balls to say: \"You don't want to seem like an asshole to your friends to get your food first and have them wait for a 'long' time, would you?\"

I couldnt believe how unprofessional and unamicable the owner was. He tried explaining a bunch of other useless chatter, but I just decided to take the business to another pho restaurant down the street.  I can't understand why the owner pushes a gratuity charge on large parties when this place IS NOT BIG ENOUGH to seat parties of 4 or more!!! 

Pho Bosa didn't have much of a crowd there and its built in a sketchy industrial area, probably isn't safe there anyway. We also chose this place cause we wanted to give them some business. I'm a firm supporter of small business owners as I am one myself.  But I guess this was decided otherwise. 

One thing I also found really bizarre was that the owner was non-Asian, I don't know, but I think Asian owned pho joints will taste much better. LOL. Just and observation. By the way, most of the other reviews on here are bogus."}
{"text":"Great broth! Excellent customer service!! We will definitely be coming back again! 
Hubby ordered the Beef Pho - Tons of flavor! Beef balls were very very tasty. 
I ordered the BBQ pork and Chinese sausage rice plate which was excellent. 
Had 2 Vietnamese ice coffees with boba and boy were they strong!! In a good way!! Thumbs Up Pho Bosa!! You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I dine here.
Not only is the food delicious, fresh, and well seasoned. The staff ALWAYS remembers myself and My brother when we come in. That right there is why I keep coming back to Pho Bosa! This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant.  Try the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, And the Pork Spring Rolls!!! Hell just try a little of everything!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Service is pretty prompt. Though, both times that I went, it was pretty empty. Area isn't too good for them, I'd say. They answer any and all questions that you have and if you don't get how their combo works, they'll be more than happy to explain everything. Seems to know their stuff, that's for sure.

I got #40 Thit Nuong (egg rolls, shredded pork loin, egg quiche, and grilled pork = it's a broken rice plate platter thing). 
-- Egg quiche wasn't my thing but I really liked the egg rolls. Everything else was just eh. Nothing stood out here. I guess broken rice isn't my thing. 

On my second visit, I tried their #71 Pho Dac Biet.
I actually enjoyed the meat but as far as the noodles go.. bleh. I was just putting the hoisin sauce on it because it didn't taste good without it. The noodles were disappointing.

They also use square for their CC payments so you can hook up an account on squareup.com to use square wallet to pay."}
{"text":"service: good.

food: the soup were but salty but it was overall very tasty! We ordered the house special pho and there were many toppings. 

environment: they have cushion and it's nice."}
{"text":"After a night of binge drinking me and my friends were craving a big ole bowl of pho. We went to yelp and found Pho bosa. Seeing that it has high reviews , we decided to try it out. 

It's a small restaurant so it's definitely not good for big groups. 

My whole table of 5 people ordered all pho and one bun rieu. We waited for about 15-25 mins to get our food. We were all pretty pissed that we had to wait so long for a bowl of pho. That's not even the worst part. The broth was bland and the noodles were hard. Then when the bill came out it just didn't add up. It was expensive.. 


Will not be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Mission: Escape the food halls and overpriced Vegas hotel restaurants.
Objective: Find real food, cure hangover.

A quick look on Yelp we were able to find Pho Bosa. Located in a crappy looking strip mall without much signage, but quickly realized we had discovered a hidden gem. The pho broth was amazing. Authentic, beefy goodness, that satisfied our objective immediately. 

Very affordable, great service (kind enough to call us a cab and allow us to sit inside while waiting to escape the heat-- despite our many items of baggage clogging up their narrow front doorway!), great product. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best bun bo hue? I think not. Came here as a fueling stop to my tummy from arches. The bowls are huge, they give u a lot of soup. That is always a plus except if the broth was good! This case it isn't. The broth was so water down, blood cubes doesn't taste as fresh either.I had way better broth in most Vietnamese restaurants. My friends pho was really oily as well, and no option of tripes.2 stars for the viet coffee



Ok top of that they make u tip on the tablet right in front of them. Awkward"}
{"text":"Omg they only have one size bowl and it claims to be a \"large\". The bowl is so small. Where I'm from, in Orange County, that would be considered a small bowl. And at $8.25 for that \"large\", it's ridiculous. That is a typical $5 bowl. It should not exceed $5. Whatever though, it took me forever to find this place and I'm not going to go searching around for a better place when I'm on vacation and don't know where I'm going. Oh well, at least the bowls have a hearty amount of noodles and meat. Still not happy about the price"}
{"text":"This place uses a lot of MSG in their pho. I ordered the pho dac biet and the broth had very weak beef flavor. The thit tai is chewy. My friend ordered the bun rieu and it was watered down with no crab taste. They charge $1 for vinegar onion and will calculate the automatic gratuity for parties of 5 or more on total AFTER taxes."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for a short fam vacay and decided to stop by this place based on the reviews.

Couldn't have found it without yelp bc it's such a hole in the wall place.  Everything was a lot pricier than I expected. $8.99 for 5 egg rolls and $8.5 for what can only be considered a medium sized pho even tho they call it a \"large\". (No option for smaller sizes)

Everything was just okay.  My biggest complaint is the service. They gave us maybe 20 strings of carrot/dikon strings for the egg rolls and when I asked for more the lady was so condescending. Saying they have to charge us extra.... That's fine if I have this policy, but the attitude was uncalled for.  All in all, mediocre food, high pricing, and horrible service - would not recommend."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa was a delicious, authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, Las Vegas. The atmosphere is friendly and quaint. The staff was incredibly friendly. The food was fantastic. My friends and I had the beef Pho, which was complimented with fresh basil, jalapeños and your choice of chili sauces. I would highly recommend Pho Basa to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"This Pho place is soooooo good! Let me tell you, I stayed in the Venetian hotel looking for a good Pho place but one? They didn't have Pho. The Wynn hotel? I believe had a Pho spot but they were charging like $14-$17 a bowl! hahaha! I am from the Washington DC area, no one pays $17 for some noodles and broth! We found this place!! Pho Basa. Somewhat off the \"tourist section\" of Vegas and let me tell you! It was BUSY!! We had to wait like 15 minutes to get a seat. That shows that this place get business. 

They finally seated us for a table for four people and they gave us the menu. The bowls were like $8.50 for the large and $7.50 for a small and the portions are large! The broth was so tasty! The sprouts and leaves were fresh and not wilted. They have wooden disposable chopsticks that made it easy to eat with. 

They had one bathroom for each gender and it was clean. 

They do not split checks so be prepared for that. And the first guy said that they couldn't take credit cards, which was weird but it was an error on their end of things but we managed to pay and leave after 15 minutes of issues. This experience was the only downfall. But other than that? This place is what sparked my Pho drive back. I went to one place 5 years ago and it was NASTY lol ever since then never went to a PHO place ever again. This made me start going again in Maryland. haha! Good sneaky Pho restaurant in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Pho Bosa...wow this is my new favorite spot in Las Vegas, the food is amazing, the service is great and the servings are generous, I am happy to report this place is clean and I will continue to come here on my monthly Las Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Compare to LA, the pho here is really so so.
I would not recommend my friends to go here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was craving asian while vacationing vegas so decided on pho.  Just searched on Yelp for pho and Pho Bosa was the first in the list so picked here....

Service very good.  A mixture of Viet and black staff.  The americans were conscientious and served with a happy attitude.  Mind you, Asian restaurants--esp. Viet and Chinese--are not known for exceptional service....

I'm not a pho expert and have trouble differentiating between good and bad pho...  Is it the noodles?  Clear or murky broth better?  As long as you pass the taste test, your pho is fine with me!  Passed!  Portion was definitely good for a large bowl.

What deserves mention are their summer rolls.  I think they add a column of spring roll wrapper in the summer roll.  This added a crunchy texture that won me over.  I gladly helped my gf finish her share when she got full!  Here is a pic of their summer roll... the crunchy goodness comes from the column on the left... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-bosa-las-vegas?select=pDC37VraokbrQZGObeRIWg#U03LDP_MSFhgyH2h0h1s7A.

Good pho, great service.  Summer rolls are a must!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating at Pho Bosa last week since someone wanted to try it. 

It was located outside of Chinatown but close enough. We had a few dishes that were very tasty. Beef pho which was good, a banh mi sandwich that had really great bread, tofu spring rolls with a peanut dipping sauce and parmesan tater tots. 

I was surprised by all the options they had and will definitely be back to try some more of the sandwiches they offer."}
{"text":"The food was damn good. I can't stress it enough so I won't. The atmosphere reeks if third world luxury but that's a good thing you judgemental American assholes. Our server was very courteous and friendly and have my party advice on other things to do when we return from Vegas. I would recommend this place if you love vietnamese food. Ban lo dit."}
{"text":"2017 Yelp 100 Challenge!!
47/100

Yes, there are other Pho places but this place does serve the same Pho!

I was sick and was dying for some hot stew! PHO~! Service was great and ordering was EASY! 

4 girls were hungry so we did end up ordering A LOT. Pho here is danky and delicious! And the servings NO JOKE! 

This location may seem like a run down plaza but expect NO WAIT! - why not?! 

My new Pho spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pho Bosa for me is like comparing my mother's cooking to my mother in law's cooking. They are both delicious but completely different and hard to compare the two. This is how I feel about Pho Bosa in comparison to my other Pho spot in town.

I am a huge fan of their peanut sauce that they make and serve warm with their fresh spring rolls. They offer both pork and chicken sausage and the flavor in the sausage is mild. But that dipping sauce makes up for any flavor lost.

The pho here is decent, good, and solid. My noodles were a bit soft in my bowl. And if you have read my other pho reviews, you know that I keep an eye out for any silver or green tinge of coloring on my meats and I didn't see any until my last few pieces of meat. And one piece had a really funky taste to it, which I spit out immediately but other than this - I liked their pho.

The bun bo hue is a winner for me here too. I asked for extra spicy and was delivered just that. The ingredients were fresh and good. The meat however was too big in portion and it would have been a better experience for me if it had been sliced smaller.

The one downfall for me about this place is their bathroom. I do not like that I have to walk outside to use a bathroom."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the old Bosa 1 so i had to check this new location, and needless to say, it lived up to the hype. 
I went there twice once for lunch and once late night. Both times the staff were very nice and helpful. They made suggestions and seemed genuinely happy to be there.
I had the rice plate which was pretty good, but not a world beater. The bun bo hue on the other hand is to die for. The meat is so tender and juicy I could eat it for days. 
However the only thing I wasnt very high on was the shrimp cakes. I'd heard they were good and they tasted fine but waaay too greasy.
This place definately gets two thumbs up from this  foodie :D"}
{"text":"We tried every Pho restaurant in vegas this is by far the best one yet! Oxtail pho highly recommended!"}

They want to charge a 10.50 service charge for five. They say babysat that they policy.. They didn't even refill our water or come back to see if we needed anything...we eat out all the time. We always like to show our appreciation.. This is the first time we pissed and didn't tip and will never be back to this place..."}
{"text":"Had the pho here, it was good and not over priced for the quality and size! The pho broth did have more of a fishy taste than what Im used to, so Im assuming they use more fish sauce to make their broth."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. We needed a table for 14. They were able to accommodate our party on two tables of 7 instead.

After a weekend of partying in Vegas, vietnamese food sounded perfect.

I ordered my usual, pho tai. There was only one size option, large. I added all my veggies and spices. They definitely did not skimp on the meat, which was nice and tender. The broth was a little greasier than I'm used to though.

It's no Golden Deli. But it was a good option for where we were."}
{"text":"Our last day in Vegas, we decided to try Viet food and this Pho Bolsa come up in Yelp with all the \"best food\", \"excelent food\", \"friendly service\" and all so we came. The broth was plain, tasted like simply water, noodles were still hard like they just poured hot water through, rare beef was dry, not to mention fatty brisket smell......idk... different. I agree with the good and friendly service part though I won't come back again."}
{"text":"The wait to get food is ridiculously long here. We waited almost 30 min at the table and still haven't gotten our orders. I've never waited this long before at any pho restaurants. Not sure whether they are understaffed or just slow at getting the food out. Maybe try coming here when it's empty."}
{"text":"Oily soup base , rude welcome , bad waitress especially the one without good English and really tiny portions of cold tea other then that food is ok"}
{"text":"I debated between four and five stars for this place. I really like the food. Great quality at a very good price. The pho tastes real, and not like it was made with some spice packet. The staff were also extremely nice, which I don't find too often in the places on and around Spring Mountain.

My only complaints, which are very nit-picky and very minor, are that it would have been cool if the TV were on with a game or something. Also, the glass of water had that \"Straight Outta Flint\" taste to it. I know it's not a fancy restaurant but would be good if they would filter the water before serving it.

Excellent place though, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious. We ordered the shrimp roll and crab soup. Our server was extremely helpful by showing us how to wrap the shrimp rolls and what sauces to use with specific dishes. Our server's name was Mimi."}
