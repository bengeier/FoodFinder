{"text":"Another place who delivers good fried chicken.  My order gets messed up more than I would like, mostly they forget things like soda and desert cookies but they are always willing to make it right.  Will continue to give them my business.    PS try the chip dip!"}
{"text":"I can't even put into words how bad they messed the super bowl up today. My own story and the stories of others that were also picking up... insane. NEVER going here again and making sure everyone i know NEVER goes here again. What a shame and embarrassing establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered here many times, chicken is pretty good. The pizzas aren't consistent. Sometimes really good, then we've gotten partially burnt and sometimes the middle of the pizza is really soggy..."}
{"text":"For the 1st time in around 5 years I tried Tommy's, I won't ever have it again. My food was delivered hot, well.... the chicken was anyway. I paid over $9.00 for a small dinner salad that I didn't get, the pizza was almost leathery in it's texture and to top it all off the delivery guy tried to beat me out of $5.00 when he gave me my change! I don't recommend that anyone order from Tommy's. I know that I never will again. I hate that I have to give them even 1 star, they are horrible!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Picked up a undercooked pizza .grease was so bad it went though the bottom of the box onto my car seat when I asked them about they did nothing. Thats Ok I will not recommend them to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered the party pack for my inlaws 50th aniv.party.we had 40 people who all loved the fried chicken(amish gerber chiken),and the pizza ,it was as good as any in lakewood.You should really try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. The food is so/so and we couldn't even order a pizza at 9:30 on a Saturday. This site says they are open til 11. Guess they close when they feel like it and didn't need our $100 order. We used to order from there every Friday until they \"forgot\" our order one night. The next week the food was terrible. Never again!!"}
{"text":"I never had this pizza before, but overall it was good, $19 for mediujm pizza worth it?? ehh i'm still not sure.. I really don't like that when you walk in all you see is a white wall. im all about sanitation, so not being able to see ANYTHING being prepared makes me uncomfortable, so for this reason and the price, I might not go back.  Definately worth trying out though, pizza was delicious.  I gave the rating 4/5 stars because of  the taste only. Service was ok they seemed understaffed. But my pizza was still ready on time for pickup. Theres a lot of competition out there especially in pizza so, hopefully they can at least cut the price a little bit."}
{"text":"From out of town and had a surprise birthday party for my son in Brunswick. Ordered sheet pizza, sub sandwiches and wings. It was delivered exactly on time. The food was great. Pizza for the buffet was excellent. The subs had so much meat and other ingredients and included mayo and Italian dressing. The wings were big. Got mild and garlic Parmesan. They tasted great and were crispy. Tommy's did a great job. I was nervous feeding 50 people. Now that I know, I would put that stress on Tommy's next time knowing they would deliver as promised."}
{"text":"We are regular customers of Tommys. The food is sooo good. We get anything from pizza to ribs and fried chicken. You have to eat their fried chicken - it's amazing. They also deliver ice cream from Hollys next door which is an added bonus for sure! Every once in awhile they might forget something in the delivery order, but they always accommodate and honestly everyone makes mistakes sometimes. You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free cheesy breadsticks and pizza were absolutely delicious - best I've had anywhere, including NYC and Boston."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Tommy's probably a dozen or so times for work meetings.  It is terrible.  Besides the food, it's 50% more expensive than other delivery places AND takes twice as long to deliver.  I've orders lunches for the same group of 4-5 people and typically spend $40-$50 getting pizza from other pizza places, Chinese delivery, or Jimmy John's.  But Tommy's?  $65+ easily... and to top it off they always take a full HOUR to get your your food?!?  I'm from NY, so I'm a bit of a pizza snob... but Tommy's pizza is terrible.  Try Emilio's or Zeppe's... both have FAR better pizza then Tommy's.  The salads are atrocious.  I don't understand why people like Jo-Jo's.  Last time I ordered lunch from Tommy's, my Styrofoam was melted because there were no vents, and my entire meal was soggy.  To summarize: - 50% over priced compared to competition - Takes 2x longer to deliver - Food is below average at best - Use inappropriate containers for food"}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza and wings, wings were great 5 star, the pizza toppings were good, the pizza dough (3 star) was soggy towards the center. Might try again"}
{"text":"We got some takeout from this place solely because we were tipped off to the VIP club (sign up, get free pizza).  We probably won't go back often simply because it's too far from home.  We got 2 medium pizzas, one with sausage and one with meatballs.  I could not tell which was which.  Both tasted like sausage to me.  Pizza was acceptable.  Not the best I've had, but not bad either.  I don't remember how much the price was for a medium one topping, so I can't say if it is worth the cost.  We also got a 10pc jo jo potatoes for $3.99, which seemed too expensive for the size of the order.  The best thing was the large spinach salad for $8.99.  It was huge, had tons of toppings, and was very fresh.  Definitely would get that again.  I don't think I could have made it myself for $8.99."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of Lakewood's best kept secrets. We used Tommy's to cater Lorelei's birthday party last weekend. We got a mini party-pack, which included a half-sheet of one-topping pizza, a tray of salad, a tray of rigatoni, 20 potato aweomethingies whose name I can't remember, and a tray of fried chicken. Everything was AWESOME and it was really affordable (and tip was included in the cost). They called us the day before to confirm, arrived right on time (even a few minutes early) and provided plates/napkins/plasticware which was appreciated even though we didn't need it.  As someone who never, ever eats fried chicken, I was slobbering over this stuff for days after the party. It was so good. The rigatoni was too, surprisingly. And I love the pizza. But the standout was definitely the fried chicken. The flavor was perfect, the chicken was juicy -- just great.  Check Tommy's out for catering, or just for a pig-out fest of your own."}
{"text":"Just ordered here for first time pizza chicken all great will be back again fore sure"}
{"text":"This place seems so overrated! Pizza tasteless, skimpy amount of sauce and toppings. Chicken seems very overrated, heck I think KFC's is tastier and this places was equivalent to what a grocery store sells as already prepared chicken. Internet and menu prices not the same, driver forgot my soft drinks & wasn't even nice or apologetic. Certainly many better options around."}
{"text":"The pizza is so/so. Breaded chicken is on the greasy side. The ribs and wings on the other hand are quite good. They are on pricey side of take out but well worth it. The burgers are ok too. They are always on time with their orders and we've never had an order done wrong in over 7 years."}
{"text":"Good not great pizza.  Definitely better than Papa John's and Pizza Hut.  I like their crust the best--chewy and thick.  We always ask for extra sauce but they skimp on it.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"How do you serve a soggy pizza.  I place an order for a pizza and picked it up 20 minutes later.  Tried to eat it in the car and the pizza was super soggy.  After trying 2 bites of it and others a bite or 2 we all gave up and just threw the pizza away. We got better food across the street at the Get Go."}
{"text":"I think they offer a great menu. I think the chicken should be more prevalent than the pizza. The pizza is rather forgetful and mediocre. Everything else on the menu though is delicious. The breadsticks, salads, and chicken are top notch. I've been here a few times and I would recommend the chicken tender fold over. Unless you have a heart condition there is no excuse for not ordering one. I think they could offer a great many varieties of the fold over as they seem to have the recipe down.   Tommy's hasn't steered me wrong yet so if you're looking for good food don't pass up the chance."}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza, chicken and ribs from Tommy's on numerous occasions.  However tonight I called and was put on hold for over ten minutes, which was fine, and I placed my order.  Before I had a chance to give the woman my credit card number she hung up on me and so I called right back.  She told me she was going to put me on hold again and I said, \"hey, I just wanted to give you my credit card information on the order I just called in.\"  She said, \"Okay, I'm just going to put you on hold for ooooonne second!\"  Ten minutes later, she's back on the phone and asks if I'm still there.  I say yeah, but it was a little longer than one second!   She apologizes and says that they're busy and she's the only one answering phones, and I say, no worries and give her my credit card number.  She asks if I want to add a tip for the driver and I say that I'll tip him when he gets to my house.  She tells me it'll be an hour wait.  An hour and a half later the delivery driver arrives and I give him a $2 tip on a $10 order.  Then he gives me the pizza.  Not only is the pizza half-cooked with so much cheese that you couldn't pick up a slice if you tried, but the box is soggy soaking dripping wet and yellow.  I'm pretty sure that someone peed on that pizza, but even if they didn't it was unacceptably gross and we just threw it away.  Last time we order from Tommy's."}
{"text":"so when i moved to Brunswick, the folks at Tommy's Pizza and Chicken were nice enough to send me a coupon for a free medium pizza (2 toppings) or a chicken dinner. we chose the pizza on Sunday night and i thought it was delicious. we got our usual - pepperoni and banana pepper. what i liked most was that every bite had both pepperoni and banana pepper. the dough was neither too thick nor too thin (not sure if that's possible). the sauce tasted great as well.   i can't imagine i'll not go back for more pizza at some point, though their prices are a bit higher than i'd prefer to pay, though there's no denying how much better the quality is over cheap places like Georgio's, Marco's or Little Caesar's. It's worth the occasional splurge, for sure."}
{"text":"We were looking for fried or broasted chicken nearby and decided to give this place a chance. We got the 8-piece \"just chicken\", and wow, was it good! Not sure if it is broasted, but that is how it seemed. Crispy, fine breading, nothing thick like batter. It was golden brown, juicy, with large pieces - at first we mistook the thighs for breasts. We'll definitely re-order from here, and try some of their other things, too, like ribs. I hope this place is consistently good."}
{"text":"Over charged us $2 and sent a pizza with mouse fur on it. When we called to complain the owner told us not to call them ever again and they don't need our business. No problem Rick. Lots of options in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Tommy's is back. After a couple horrible experiences a couple years ago we haven't ordered from there until recently. Every time so far the food has been good and ready or delivered when they said it would be. Tonight is the first time we've tried the pizza since beginning to order from here again. We opted for the NY style and it missed the mark. It taste good and looked like a NY pie but the closer you got to the center of the pizza it got thicker and thicker. It was the same thickness as a regular pizza by that point. When you order a NY you want thin and this one just didn't have it tonight. The outside crust was perfect thickness or should is say thinness for a NY style pizza. If the whole thing could have maintained that thin crust it would have been a good attempt at a NY style pie. One more thing I didn't like is that they put the onions underneath the cheese. Probably won't go with the NY again but their regular pizza is good. Tommy's is not bashful with the amount of cheese or pepperoni they use so if you're into that sort of thing...you'll love the pizza. Glad to see Tommy's is back to the way it was years ago."}
{"text":"Was in the area and heard that this place had great chicken and I'm sure glad that I did...It was fantastic! Super juicy and moist.  Dealt with the owner Drew and he was so nice.  He explained that his mom, who was sick had passed away about 1 year ago and he took over the store...He is doing great job!!  Next time I'm in the area I will definitely stop by for more delicious chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the last person is talking about - Tommy's is still open in Strongsville! Great food!"}
{"text":"Over priced and disappointing.   I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this place. Menu looked great. The guy on the phone was nice.  I ordered a cheese pizza, a New York style pizza and 12 boneless BBQ wings. Let's start with the grand total of almost $60. Which, I'm my opinion, is just crazy.  My New York pizza was extremely soggy, the cheese was all to one side as if the delivery guy took a hard turn. The wings were haphazardly dowced with sauce and also soggy.  Not worth an almost $60 tab. Seriously. I order pizza at least once a week. I have not had a bill close to this amount in this area, ever. I am always looking for a new place but this place I will never order from again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered pizza, chicken, Jo Jo fries and other various items from Tommy's. We've enjoyed their food on about 3 different occasions. Food was ok however the wait for delivery was always at least an hour and we needed to heat in the oven because it was warm, not hot. Today, we ordered a \"football special\" they told me about when I called. It was a large 1 topping pizza and 10 wings for $19.99. I gave my credit card number over the phone and said to add a $2 tip. The food arrived an hour and 20 minutes later. It was not even warm. As I was heating it up in the oven I looked at my receipt which read $25.99. I called to see why it was so expensive and I spoke to 3 different people who all told me 3 different things. Once I spoke to the manager she said GE special was $23.99. Then she said it was $21.99. She then said that she had no clue why I was told $19.99. She wasn't even going to give me $2 back. She said it was miscommunication and didn't even apologize. After having to tell her I wanted my $2 several times she said that she could credit my account or I could drive to the store and pick it up. My husband then spoke to her and said that he wanted the $2 delivered to us or that defeated the point of having paid for delivery in the first place. She said fine she would have it delivered. After 15 minutes in the oven we ate our slightly warmer pizza and wings. I ate 2 wings and 1 slice of pizza. Upon picking up my second slice something fell off of it onto my plate. After my husband and I both examined it we concluded it was FUR! Yes FUR! It was dark grey and about the size of a nickel with cheese and sauce on it. We called immediately and spoke with the manager who basically called my husband a lier. She did NOT apologize. She said she could either refund our money or make us another pizza. We did NOT want another pizza from this place so we chose a refund. She said in order for us to get a refund we would have to bring the remaining pizza and FUR to them! We said absolutely not, you come and get it. We also asked for the owners name and info. The manager just called me now to say the delivery person is on there way to get the pizza and FUR and that she just spoke with the owner, Rick, and that Rick said and I quote, \"I don't need their business. Tell them to never order from my store again!\" We are waiting for the delivery person who is also supposed to be bringing us a full cash refund. My husband works for the Cuyahoga County Board of Health and has already put a call into the guy that deals with restaurant sanitation complaints and he will be paying Tommy's a thorough visit."}
{"text":"This is pickup or delivery location. They have a real ny style pizza with a thin crust and huge pieces. You'll want extra cheese or you won't get much. The thin crust and cheese comes out a nice Brown color. The sauce is prefect match for pepperoni. You can easy fold over pieces the crust can take it!  This is actually better than the lady time I had regular pizza. For that change of pace pizza, it's almost perfect. For the coupon savvy, no luck on this one."}
{"text":"Wings are good, the pizza and speed not so much. Prices are insane and pick up is always chaotic."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty bland overall. The cheese slid off too easily. They screwed up my order. Won't be going back, should have had a bucket of Churches Fried w Slaw. The worst part is dat it took a few days to \"pass the dough\" from my body.   Update...my stomach still messed up. They must mix cement w the dough. Needed to take a laxative to rid my body of this demon pizza!"}
{"text":"They have very good wings. It's a little pricey than some other pizza places but if you don't mind spending a little extra money it's worth. The pizza sizes are bigger than normal. But thats what I like is the big slices of pizza. You can not compare this to a chain because it's better than a chain pizza place."}
{"text":"We get Tommy's pretty often.  We love their NY pizza, their regular pizza, and their ribs. Salads are just OK."}
{"text":"We got the $150 catering package for my daughters birthday party - Best value we found.  It came with pizza,  jojos, rigatoni, fried chicken,  and salad.  All were great.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"Reviewing the gluten free pizza & cheesy bread only: The gluten free pizza only comes as a medium and with 2 toppings the pizza was $20,98.  The pizza crust it self was actually good.  There was very little sauce and I don't think the 2 pieces I had even had 1 mushroom on it.  The toppings were pretty much non-existent.    The cheesy bread was burnt around the edges and had an ok amount of cheese on them.    Probably won't be trying Tommy's again."}
{"text":"2 topping medium pizza 6 wings and a salad $35....what a joke...not impressive food either."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent, runs a tad on the greasy side. Wings were so/so. Spicy BBQ was pretty good but the Parmesan Garlic was super underwhelming, no garlic flavor at all and more like butter and cheese. All in all, they're not bad but they're not the best and for the price, I'd rather spend that amount of money somewhere else."}
{"text":"So after being disappointed by Angelo's, my boyfriend and I, continuing our hunt for the best slice in Cleveland, tried this place. We ordered pepperoni and arrived back home with an erroneous meat lovers. The kind of meat lovers where you can't see or taste the pizza for all the meat. Needless to say, it wasn't what we were hoping for.   HOWEVER, Tommy's did call and leave a voicemail, realizing their mistake and offering several solutions to fix their error. With customer service like that, it's worth giving this place another try, and we will."}
{"text":"The perfect meat lovers pizza, there was more meat that crust. The barbecue chicken pie was equally as tasty. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I want to like this place but I just can't. I think it's under new management and maybe that's the problem. They are rude, your food could take hours to show up and then it's not even cooked all the way through and they don't care. I'm so glad we have enough other better choices in the area, no way am I giving this place my business again."}
{"text":"Peter W. history lesson #1:  I grew up in Rocky River and from the time I was born until the sad day when I was away at college and it closed, Trio's Pizza on Lake Road was the yardstick by which all pizza was measured.  Over the years, I have had all kinds of pizza in all kinds of places, some of it better and some if it worse than Trio's, but either way Trio's was the benchmark to be met or exceeded.   Why do I bring this up in a review for Tommy's Pizza?    Because the pizza we got from Tommy's last night tasted exactly like Trio's to me, and I couldn't be happier about it.  Sauce that was't too sweet, nor too tangy, a lot of but not too much cheese, and a generous covering of pepperoni.  If there's one thing I would change, it's that there wasn't as much of a ring of crust around the outside as I prefer, but that's really not a big deal considering the rest of the pie.   Peter W. history lesson #2:  For years I have been bemoaning the lack of good fried chicken in Lakewood.  I have found a couple of good sources for the stuff in this neck of the woods, but those places tend to have hours that don't necessarily jive with mine, so I was still looking for a reliable place to order chicken from.     Having tried Tommy's chicken, I think we might have a winner.  The chicken was crispy and seasoned well.  It was good hot out of the box, and it also passed the morning after straight out of the fridge test (the pizza did too for that matter).  The accompanying JoJo fries and cole slaw were great as well.  With one other location in Strongsville, I'm glad Tommy's chose to open up store number two in Lakewood, and even happier that they chose a location so close to my home.  I'm pretty sure this is going to be our new go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I spent the weekend in Cleveland and as we normally do while we are away, we search out restaurants that advertise as gluten-free as my wife needs to abide by that diet.   Tommy's has the most variety of any gluten-free place we have been to. Most of the time the GF options are simply standard menu fair with the gluten parts taken out, usually leaving a bland experience. Here all of the items (as far as we know) were not like that. The GF stromboli and breadsticks were both excellent. My wife got one white and one red stromboli (one to take home). Both were delicious and a very large portions to where she wasn't even able to finish her first. The same can be said for the breadsticks.  I tried the friend chicken, with jo-jo fries and hush puppies.   The fried chicken was great! Tender and juicy and not overly greasy. I highly recommend it. JO-JO fries are a potato that appears to be cut into 4 pieces length, battered in a similar but lighter version of the fried chicken. The fries were excellent and the portions served were very generous. The same can be said for the hush puppies, I was expecting 5 or 6 and I counted over 15.  The manager or someone working there overheard we drove out to Lakewood specifically to try Tommy's out and that we were then driving 2+ hours back home. They were nice enough to supply me with some extra jo-jo fries and a couple of pieces of chicken of which I enjoyed for lunch the next day.   Highly recommend and we will go back the next time we go to Cleveland."}
{"text":"They are usually good but they unfortunately closed down on 09/02/2017. Sucks that they were closing out of nowhere. There is still one in Cleveland tho."}
