{"text":"Soga shabu shabu is the worst chinese food I've had in years. As an orange chicken enthusiast I was excited to try their orange chicken and Lo Mein. The orange chicken tasted worse than a microwaveable version. The Lo mein was drenched in butter and lacked flavor. One of the worst establishments I've dined at in a long time. Not going back!"}
{"text":"I went for hot pot here on a Friday night around 9:30 pm. Overall it was good, and I definitely want to go back. The place was a bit empty, but it did seem like we missed the dinner crowd.  We got the spicy broth and it was perfect. The chicken was a bit dry, but that's probably because we failed and over cooked it. They also had these pork dumpling things that were amazing. Overall the place seemed pretty authentic, and the food was good. I am giving it four stars though because the ambiance just doesn't feel great when you are the only one eating in a restaurant for about half your meal, even if it's a bit late."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I loved their bentobox till one day. I ordered for pickup. They mixed the sweet cake into the spicy savory side.  Seriously? You guys cannot even find a single zip bag to separate my cake?  I'm not going there any more."}
{"text":"I want to like Soga. I love shabu shabu, and this is the only place (I know of) to get authentic shabu shabu in Madison. Their broth is delicious; delicate and reminiscent of the sea, it takes on the flavors of the ingredients you choose to dip.  Unfortunately, the service is tepid, at best. I've been here twice; the first time, we had to wait up by the bar for 5 minutes before anyone would come out and let us pay our check. The most recent time, we still had to get up and try to hunt someone down to pay. You'd think they wouldn't make it so hard to pay....  The last time we went, we ordered Mai Tais. For $6 on the menu, we were impressed with both their balance and their strength. When the bill arrived, we were surprised to see we had been charged $7 apiece. We asked the waitress about the price discrepancy; she apologized, and said their bartender was out for the evening, so they needed to go across the street to Osaka House to source the drinks. While we gladly would have approved had she notified us of this before we ordered, we were not happy to be charged more than we agreed. Plus, no effort was made to correct the error (just \"sorry, I should have told you - but that's what it costs\"). It wasn't the price that irked us; it was the fact that they didn't disclose what we would actually pay.  Both times we've eaten there, the employees have been on their phones, sitting in the dining room - ignoring customers. This last time, they were eating staff meal an hour before they closed - again, in the dining room. I've been disappointed in customer service and problem resolution. I think 2 strikes is it for this place...."}
{"text":"Good food aside, their service is mediocre on a very nice day, and as for now, excruciatingly slow. I have a grubhub order put down for 11:10, and the food still hasn't arrived. It is 13:12 right now. The least they could have done is give us a courtesy call to explain why the food isn't arriving for over 40 minutes past the estimated delivery time (they sent me a text saying 12:20), and we had to call twice just to make sure that they hadn't forgotten about us.  If anyone is in the mood for Chinese food that's both good AND offers good service, try Ichiban. At least the lady there knows how to treat their customers. As for me, Soga's lost themselves a regular customer.  To be fair, they serve delicious Chinese food, and anyone visiting their location is in for a treat. What a shame, really."}
{"text":"I used to love Soga. Their shabu is pretty good.   However, their service is terrible. Not only does it take forever to get anything- especially the check- the add an automatic gratuity of 20%. Even if you are a party of TWO. They do not deserve a 20% gratuity, especially awarding it on themselves.   When confronted about their practice, they simply say they started doing this \"a few weeks ago.\" I doubt this practice is uniform for all customers, but either way i would not recommend this place. Too bad I had almost become a regular."}
{"text":"The shabu shabu broth is really tasty and the service has been excellent every time I visited. Unfortunately this place was pretty quiet all of the 4 or 5 times I've been and I'm worried it may not last. Try  this place and bring a friend or two with you!"}
{"text":"No idea what the shabu shabu is like here, come for the Chinese though.  In particular order the big plate chicken, it's a chicken/noodle/potato dish that is exquisite.  Also a lamb spicy soup and a beef dish also in a spicy sauce.  I can't recall the names, but you want to order from the special handwritten menu.  Trust me, this is the best Chinese in Madison."}
{"text":"PLEASE CHECK THE BILL before giving your money. This place has hand-written orders and they usually charge 30 cents or a dollar more than what you had because they think you won't pay attention. This has happened so many times to us that I no longer believe it is a \"random mistake\". Couple of our friends have also experienced this situation. This is about the integrity of running a business. 50 cents may be nothing to you, but if this place is earning 50 more for each table, it's a lot of money that they don't deserve."}
{"text":"If you have an hour to wait for your food then this would be a good place. We waited an hour and then some comes to tell us the ingredient are out to make our dish... after 1 hour. Finally another hour later our food came, it was clearly sitting on a counter in the back for awhile since it was just barely warm. Entire dining took 3.25 hours! I forget about your server coming to your table, you have to flag them down for everything."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I sat down and found the waitress knew nothing about the menu, and we could only guess what we would get; we also expressed our food allergy concerns and they replied nothing. When we got the check we found that the tips had already been added into the total, which was not very pleasing, but that was a dinner so we accepted the amount.  The second time was weekday lunch, we had four people, ordered a hot pot and spent about $45 in total. The waitress had a very cold face and the service was slow, or I would say in bad manner, and this time the tip was $18! We said we only have four persons and this is a weekday lunch without a good service (even without a smile), but the waitress insisted that this is \"regulated by the boss\". Unreasonable. We could do nothing but pay... And the hot pot was not the very authentic Chinese style."}
{"text":"Second time going to Soga and I can't wait to go back. Actually texted a friend about this place while I was eating telling them they have to come here soon. We had the beef and shrimp shabu shabu and the fried squash and fried taro cakes for dessert.   The shabu shabu broth is great. It is some combo that includes fish (was told it was bonito) and other spices. Not overpowering. Just delicious. With the broth comes a large plate of beef slices, and a plate of about 8 frozen whole shrimp, as well as the standard vegetables. The veggies may vary a bit but are napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, shiitake, black mushrooms, fish cake, meatballs, pork dumplings, spinach, some other greens, taro, lotus root, and a nice helping of dried rice noodles (I think).  So these things mixed to your liking, with the broth, are great by themselves. Really the broth can be eaten like a soup it is so good. But, they bring chili paste, chili oil, sesame paste, and a mixture. And that mixture is one of the best condiments I've ever tasted and goes perfectly with whatever you have in your bowl. All for a decent price. Don't overcook things like beef and shrimp, make sure you have a decent mix of veggies and such and this will be a great and relatively cheap meal to share with someone.   The desserts were a great way to end the meal. We couldn't decide between squash and taro (who could?) and the waiter let us try both. Three cakes the size of sand dollars come on a plate. By cake I mean they are kind of in paste form, then battered and fried with some sesame seeds on top. Neither were too sweet which was perfect since we don't particularly like sweet desserts. Probably an unhealthy option considering they were fried but they didn't feel too unhealthy since they were mostly squash and taro. Will order again and would recommend with enthusiasm.   We've eaten shabu shabu and have no problems with chopsticks but the waiter was sure to brief us on the whole process and was there to help if we needed anything. Very much appreciated whether it was needed or not. Also, apparently the cakes were homemade, along with everything else. To what extent this is true I cannot vouch but everything we've had here tastes pretty homemade to our non Chinese palates.   Go here. I've noticed a bunch of places shutting down on state st and others coming in and I hope this one stays around for a while because they have a big menu and I have a lot of stuff to try."}
{"text":"Swung by for temporary farewell dinner with a friend before he headed back to China.  The place was empty when we came (5ish pm) which was nice as we got the pick of the place.  We ordered a combination plate of lamb and beef hotpot (both spicy and non spicy) with the veggies that come with it (lotus root, enoki mushrooms, lettuce, noodle, etc.) and then ordered some fish balls and extra mushrooms and other veggies on the side. In total 1 main combo plate and 3-4 small sides. Enough to feed 3 people. Next time I would have ordered a bit more meat!  The meal was fun (my first hotpot experience). There was just 2-3 sauces that you mix together for dipping your cooked food in. I was hoping for more options given what I have heard of at other hotpot locations but these sauces were traditional so I was happy enough with that.  So, a fun experience and good enough service.  Thanks Soga."}
{"text":"This is probably by far the most courteous Chinese restaurant in Madison.   It was a pleasant surprise after a hungry afternoon I felt like Chinese food but didn't want to be treated with bad service. I therefore walked upstairs to this one on State, not expecting much. Surprisingly, the waitress was pretty nice.  The food was great. My husband and I therefore came back several times and service is the same friendliness. We were especially impressed by the short hair lady who greets customers with smiles, and she talks about food and tries hard to meet our food request, though not always working out.  It was a little bit on the pricy side, and serving slightly smaller than other Chinese places. However, the place is well lit and more space, and the service mades me generally comfortable.  I would have given it 4 stars, but just learned on reviews that waitress doesn't get tips.  That was just so unfair."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and having shabu shabu. I went w 2 friends. We got the lamb and pork combo and added waygu beef. We got half the pot spicy, half regular, and we added the thick type noodles. There was plenty of food for all 3 of us. We paid $12 something before tip, very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The vegetable selection that came with it was good, also included some fish and pork balls. I had mostly spicy, and added some chili paste. When I had the noodles at the end I had to add a little regular to cool it off, but it was an enjoyable spicy flavor. The taste was phenomenal, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you don't pay attention, you just might miss it!  Soga is located on the second floor of the building, and they have a pretty small doorway on State Street, so look out.  Soga is definitely one of the places that has more authentic Chinese food, especially if you order off the Chinese menu.  I've been here numerous times, and it seems like the food is on a bit of a decline.  I think they switched owners recently, and now the food is SUPER salty.  I normally order the garlic eggplant, and that's usually pretty good, despite the change in management.  I've also come here for hot pot, which is pretty fun.  I was with a group of friends and we just ordered their \"hot pot platters\" with meat and veggies and two soup bases (spicy and not spicy).  It's a nice environment for hanging out and having hot pot, and a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"The worst food I have put in my mouth ever. I had the veggie fried rice witch was gelatinous and had almost no vegetables. My mom has the Shrimp lo mein which has the tiniest grey shrimp probably from a can and no vegetables. So bad we could not eat it. The service was terrible and we could have walked out without paying as no one was around anywhere but we hunted someone down to pay and tell them how bad it was but they could not understand or didnt care. Horrible!!! Worst food EVER"}
{"text":"Receipt added 20 percentage  tip with tip line still there .tricky business."}
{"text":"My general experience with Soga Restaurant was mediocre.   The food and the service was alright, however the reason for two stars is coming from the automatic 18% tip added to your bill even for a party of two. I was taken aback by such a forwardness by the restaurant, since this is a \"cook-yourself\" type of restaurant. When I asked my server whether she gets the tip, she told me that the tip goes straight to the owner of the restaurant. More reason not to pay extra 18% for your mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great place for large group gatherings. This place is GIGANTIC. you can also make reservations ahead of time!   Sadly, the service is rather lacking and the quality of hotpot is only so-so. If you speak mandarin, they tend to be more responsive. Still, for hotpot where the customers cook their own food, the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. had to wait maybe 20 minutes for anyone to come, had to grab my own menus, and then another 30 mins for uncooked ingredients.. The servers look like young Asian undergraduates who are not very experienced, so they don't really know who is serving which table, forget your order, combine your meat orders so you can't tell how many portions there are... yah, I'm obviously not a very happy camper. Also, usually it should be about $12 per person but somehow my bill went up to $21... and I don't even know if I got all my orders.. But since it was Chinese New Year, I didn't make a fuss.  Overall, the ingredients were so-so, but at least you don't get tummy aches after. And you get a variety of spicy chilli and peanut sauce to dip your hotpot cooked food in. Also, I like the udon noodles better than glass noodles, much more substantial meal. And, one of the HUGE fishballs are teochew fishballs, which come stuffed with minced meat (my favorite!!). Oh, before I forget, they actually had hand made steamed pork dumplings, VERY GOOD. although they look like plain soggy things, they were very well marinated and didn't even need vinegar or soy sauce to pair with!  They also have stir fry, which looked pretty good cos you can constantly see real fire in the kitchen POOFING away. so I might give that a try, sometime, maybe.  If you wanna visit, don't come hungry, and be patient!"}
{"text":"Service is not good and a bit pricey. Food is ok but the environment isn't pleasant. Won't come back. Fugu is a better place to go for Chinese food."}
{"text":"We tried Soga Shabu Shabu for an early dinner on Monday night. This was at their new location on the ground level on State Street. The location on State Street is easy to find and easy to get to. Although the restaurant has been open at this location for several months it still seemed like the space was under construction. Our waitress led us to an empty table and we perused the menus.  This is where it got confusing. There are two completely different menus. One is what I will call the American menu. It has the ubiquitous dishes found at any take-out Chinese restaurant. Cheap, filling, occasionally tasty but often bland. On their web-site they call it the All Day Menu. Then there is the multi-page 'authentic Chinese Menu'. Much more expensive but also more interesting. Offal, lamb, frog, clay-pot and specials. What makes it confusing is that some dishes appear to be on both menus but with different prices: ex: dumplings, sesame chicken, beef with broccoli. Some dishes such as Cumin Lamb were in the Chinese menu multiple times. It made me wonder what the difference was. I asked our waitress about the dumplings and she told me it was a typo but I still found it confusing as it indicated fewer dumplings at a higher price.  Regardless we ordered the dumplings, the cumin lamb and the eggplant in garlic sauce. The flavors and textures of everything we had were spot-on. The portion sizes were large enough we took some home. I do wish the prices in the Authentic Chinese Menu were more like the prices in the All Day Menu but I will definitely go back and try other items. I thought everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Yum! We got the lamb and beef combo hot pot. Good selection of sauces and toppings.fun time swishing!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't serve authentic Sechuan style food or hotpot. The broths don't have the regular spices that they're supposed to have in them and they use a gas grill for each table that doesn't work so well too.  Besides the food being below average, the service is not that great, from staff and the owner. We were also charged an extra $8 for the broth, even though the waitress didn't explain that to us (and we were still charged for it even though they made a mistake and didn't apologize) and nothing was written on the menu as well... They have combination options for hotpot but the waitress clearly told use we could order individual items to put into the hot pot instead - (we obviously didn't expect to get charged extra even though we ended up spending a lot more than a combo option, which apparently they don't charge extra for the broth)  The meat that we ordered didn't look anything like the one in the photo from the menu and so when we asked to change it they also charged more for it and the meat ended up being so dry and hard and chewy that it really almost hurt your teeth to chew after 1 piece, sadly  This restaurant has a lot to improve, to be honest - most importantly is customer service."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Excellent service, good prices, lots of choices.  I have tried a couple of dishes with spicy garlic sauce and the beef one was tender and the shrimp was excellent. Generous portions on the lunch combos.  They allowed me to swap out the egg roll on the side for 2 crab rangoon. The rangoon is excellent, though I was not as impressed by the egg roll or steamed dumpling.  The soups are all good, especially the seafood soup. Fried rice and noodle dishes I have tried were all good, as well as beef with mushrooms. The sweet and sour chicken is not impressive, but then their real expertise is more in the authentic Chinese dishes. The one pot dishes on the Shabu menu are fabulous for a ground. And best of all, there is a section to select your cook pot selections for your own favorite meats and vegetables."}
{"text":"Soga is a little hard to find, you have to go up some massive stairs which seem a little intimidating. But once you get up there the staff is very welcoming and warm. We went there pretty late, about 40ish minutes before closing time and were unsure if we should stay and eat. They told us it would be no problem and would stay open a little later for us.  We had the shrimp and beef shabu shabu. If you haven't had shabu shabu before it's a pot of boiling broth (I added pictures if you want to see) and a plate of different ingredients that you can throw in to cook. The broth itself is very good and made of bonito fish, seaweed and other spices.  It's even good to drink as a soup later on.  The shabu shabu came with a lot of vegetables and mushrooms.  The vegetables looked and tasted great.  They also had chili paste, chili oil and sesame paste to add.  It was only about $16 and we shared it in between 2 people, but a third person could have gotten in on that. It was delicious and a good value.  We also had the gyoza which is what brought us there to begin with (dumpling craving). They satisfied more than enough.  On a final note...they must not be getting many white people since like I said they are kind of hidden away. They were extremely attentive of us, making sure we knew how to use chop sticks etc."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience. This is more of a Chinese version of the traditional Japanese shabu shabu, and it's Korean cousin. We took the kids who ate well on the seafood fried rice, mostly shrimp with a few bits of squid and octopus. My wife and I shared the two meat combination, and had it spicy. Good level of spice, they didn't hold back because I am Western and assume I couldn't handle the heat. Lots of room for groups of four and some larger groups. Very extensive Chinese menu and noticed most of the customers were Chinese students which was a good sign. Prices are good and the portions are too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Shabu takes it to the next level by serving up its many Chinese, Japanese and Korean delicacies in a rustic and authentic, East meets West spacious interior, - where the food is the main attraction. The servers were cheery and prompt as they helped us navigate the expansive menu and choose the right dinner items. The food came within a very short time and was beautifully presented, fresh and spicy, and absolutely filling."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place - one of the best kept secrets of state street is up sketchy staircase, much like city bar is down a sketchy staircase.  Their sauce bar is amazing with 10-15 different options to make your shabu shabu rock even a bit more. It was a lot of food and good variation of veggies for a decent price. I like this place much more than mini-hot pot on park. The dessert buffet is a bit sketchy though."}
{"text":"This was a super great surprise. We heard rumors that there was an authentic shabu shabu spot in Madison.  The rumors were true. Authentic as  authentic gets. I felt like I was back in China. The place was a dive hole in the wall. The waitress spoke limited English. When she took our drink order my friend ordered of the menu and didn't know what a rum and coke was. I felt like I was in China! It was awesome!  We tried the hot broth and the mild. The hot wasn't crazy spicy. It was just right. The fish balls were delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been constantly searching for a Chinese restaurant in Madison that serves good sesame chicken so I decided to try this place. At first glance the sesame chicken looked incredibly appetizing, but when biting into or even trying to cut the chicken it was incredibly tough. There were barely any pieces in the whole order that appeared to be made out of quality chicken, the rest were inedible with chewy, tough, clearly not white meat chicken. I guess I'll have to keep looking for something decent in Madison. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Came here once for hot pot, wasn't good. Came back to try other things and still not impressed. Got hot & sour soup and didn't come out very hot or spicy like I asked. Mei fun noodles weren't spicy too after I asked to make it extra spicy. Also the noodles had a funny taste that I'm not used to compared to other restaurants. Not a good Chinese restaurant...."}
{"text":"Excellent prices. Yummy Chinese food! I wouldn't say it's like a gourmet, 5-star worthy restaurant.... but then again, is ANY Chinese place in Madison?  First time there, was a Friday night the week after Chinese new year. Pretty busy, pretty full of students (yes, foreign students, if that helps gage the quality).  Will definitely return. Love good Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Soga Restaurant just opened a few months ago in an upstairs restaurant location.  Their specialty is shabu shabu, a cook your own food items in a grill or soup hotplate. However, their lunch menu has some really tasty items that are under $10 - good for the student State Street crowd. The shabu shabu can be shared among 2-3 people.   I ordered their tomato egg drop soup - it was really huge, and came with a side of steamed white glutinous rice. Others at my table ordered the shabu shabu of which there are dozens upon dozens of combination ingredients (mushroom, thin sliced beef, water chestnuts, Chinese veggies, etc.). Another person ordered their garlic eggplant dish which seemed better than average.  Service was really good.  There's a bar in the back and I can see how the vision for this place was for it to be a late night, classy restaurant with nice curtains, nice tables and chairs, with a nice second floor view. I'm definitely coming back here to try their other items.  The lunch food reminded me of the much praised Sezchuan restaurant on Park St, Ichiban, but with the geographic advantage of being on State Street."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wish I could give negative stars.....I am quite the \"foodie,\" and have tried many restaurants with flavors from all backgrounds and different countries. I have seen and experienced  bad restaurants, however this may have to take #1. Though my Husband and I prefer enjoying our own homemade \"Shabu Shabu (hotpot),\" I thought we would give Soga a try; my pregnant cravings got the best of me, and we were shopping on State Street, so I thought why not?   I noticed the first red card when right when I entered, the place was all out of sorts, pretty dirty, and the bar was a little danky looking as well. It's quite humourous actually, because some of my favorite Asian restaurants are a little dingy, but this one takes the cake (perhaps a little too dirty). We were then escorted to our seats, when I experience red card #2, the woman who seated and served us insisted that we sit at a very small corner table, though I was 7months pregnant and wanted a 4-person table, she exclaimed that we only had 2 people. Finally we were given a menu, we went with the \"Fatty Beef Shabu Shabu.\" The broth was pretty good for the most part, but seem to be old. After dinner, we were given the bill, which was some where around $27.00; I then debated on what I should leave as a tip, firstly the service was not that great, and we were seated somewhere that was uncomfortable. I have worked in restaurants before and understand that tips are always nice and they are what actually pays the waiter/waitress, however I also know the duties of a waiter/waitress, and to be frank, she was not up to par, especially with the place not being too busy. I usually start around 18%, and start to deduct, only being 20% or higher if they do a good job. Some may say I am rash, but I've done my fair share of eating out and being a waitress. So, all together, with having to ask to be moved to a new table, when there were a few open and not getting it, not being asked how our meal was, or anything, I would say the tip was quite small. After tipping her, my husband and I walked out, only to be stopped by her, she then rudely said to us, \"This is all you're tipping me?!!\" I then replied, that I worked as a waitress before and that though I may be upset at tips, she was being quite rude, and has no right whatsoever to question my tipping, after all \"tips\" are rewards from a given service, and honestly, the only \"service\" we were given was following her to our seats we didn't want, and being given our food. I was outraged, but was stayed classy, as I always do, and said it's gratuity, given for service....threw $2 extra measly dollars her way and left. I am never eating here again."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, NOT very impressed. If one cares about hygiene, one may not want to go here to eat. There were flies over our food, one felt in. They might want to scrub the place a little. Food was average, I have had better chinese food in Madison. Sitting there felt like I travelled back in time. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Cold harsh winters in Madison, What better way to celebrate it with some shabu shabu (hot pot) ! This place has decent Asian food , and I am not even a picky eater. I haven't tried anything else but I enjoyed my hotpot. My friend and I ordered Chicken and Beef along with some fish balls. The broth was nice . AHHH it really does relax my tummy."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this place other than that they have options for hot pot and authentic Chinese dishes. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't your average Chinese Restaurant, they've got a lot of authentic dishes to choose from. Personally, I prefer the authentic dishes to American Chinese cuisine. I've been here twice and have enjoyed it both times and will go again because I'd like to try all of their authentic dishes. My favorite dish so far is their ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce. Other places that are similar that you might like to try: Ichiban on Park St. and Fugus."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim for lunch with a friend. I just ordered the chicken fried rice, so nothing too difficult, but it was delicious. The portions were also huge, and I got a good 2-3 meals out of one order. We also received an unexpected free plate of watermelon for dessert, which I thought was a nice touch! The place was pretty empty, and, while clean, the decor is a bit dated. Overall, it was a pleasing experience, and both my friend and I decided we would visit again."}
{"text":"This place has good authentic hotpot with tons of options for your soup. It may not be the most flashy joint but it is a great place to sit with a group of friends and eat good food. The only minor criticism I have is that the broth can be a bit salty."}
{"text":"So... it's supposed to be a Japanese restaurant but when I went here it was Chinese people and the recommended/served Chinese food. Fine with me.  Steamed chicken smothered in chili oil might be a little gristly, but apparently very Chinese. Also had some delicious combination lo mein.   Service was fine, fast & friendly. Watched a Vin Diesel movie on the tube and ate my spicy food like a boss."}
{"text":"Their service is crap but their food is absolutely amazing so I put up with the neglect. Plus, they have a free desert bar so I can never say no to free fruit."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my girlfriend and the food was delicious.  I've always wanted a hot pot place in Madison and this place really hit the spot. For 16.95 we got the fatty beef shabu shabu and it was more than enough food for us 2 (could have easily fed 3). The ingredients were fresh, the wait staff was fast & friendly, refilled drinks before they ever hit empty, and its pretty cheap. I plan on coming back with friends and family in the future."}
{"text":"Hot pot in Madison is such a genius idea. It gets deathly cold in the winter, and what better way to warm up than with a giant bowl of boiling broth where you can cook various meats and veggies at the table? Growing up, hot pot was one of my favorite family traditions, and I'm glad I can recreate it at Soga. The restaurant has a lot of tables and is good for groups. When ordering a hot pot, you can either get a set (comes with the burner and pot of broth, a plate of veggies, your choice of meat(s), and several dipping sauces), or you can order things a la carte. The set is from $17-20 and feeds 2-3 people. It's really fun to throw all these pre-sliced meats and veggies in the broth and scoop them out. The only off-putting thing about the whole experience was the hot tea they served us. It was in mugs and lukewarm."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I must admit my disappointment with this restaurant.   While on my way back from Eau Claire I had a craving for some Asian fusion, specifically soup. I looked up on Yelp and this place had some great reviews. It was relatively easy to find, and at 2:00 in the afternoon we were one of three tables, expecting great service.   All the reviews boasted the hot pots were fabulous, so we were excited to see those on the other tables. The menu was a little difficult to read, most things weren't in English, or were ingredients I had never heard of (thank you Wikipedia).   I ordered a Special Clay Pot, indicating that I was allergic to mushrooms, so to please leave that out - which left bamboo shoots and some green onion in the broth. When it came, she explained to me in broken english that even though it looked and tasted like mushrooms, she insisted it was fine. Well once I spooned through the broth it was COMPLETELY mushrooms...that's it. Obviously I couldn't eat it... she was snotty and took it back finally. I ordered a tofu hot pot (shabu shabu). She didn't explain anything about how it worked to me...just dropped off the pot of broth and a plate with three different kinds of lettuce/cabbage, some noodles, I think it was jicama? And so many things I had no idea what they were! I just kind of threw it in and let it cook. She gave us bowls so we spooned the soup into them. The broth tasted like fishy water, not good at all. The ingredients all turned to a sort of mush. It was disgusting. Once we had given it a valiant effort, we gave up. About this time, every single employee in the restaurant sat down at a table in the dining room and served up a HUGE feast for themselves. James kept signaling for a check, she'd look right at him and ignore him. She even got up three times to refill her food. We watched them eat almost 20 minutes. Finally James got up and went over there. They were shocked. They dropped off the check and never came back. He went up to the front to pay and they told us to go back to our table and wait!  We finally were able to pay (which we shouldn't have had to) and leave.  I am giving a one star rating for the service, which was reprehensible.   Our waters had no ice, the sauces had a film over the top and crusty spoons/dishes with them. The food was unsavory and the menu was confusing.   I will give their sushi two and half stars. We had the crazy dragon roll, and despite not having quite enough cream cheese in our opinion, it was very good.   I am giving Soga the benefit of the doubt according to the rest of the reviews....maybe we caught them on a bad day. A horrible terrible no good very bad day."}
{"text":"Go for the hot pot.  Get the \"fatty\" pork and the \"fatty\" beef!   Overall the restaurant is marginally nasty from a cleanliness perspective... we've sent back greens because they had dirt on them, sent back glasses because they had lipstick on them... but the hot pot is consistently great.  Note that all the hot pots come with a bunch of greens and other sides... so if you go nuts and get a bunch of extras, realize that you've already got a lot of extras coming (last time we went I tried to get an idea from the waitress what all came on the side, but the language barrier left me clueless after her response-- but otherwise service was friendly and responsive).  Also (and this is not clear) - you can get regular broth, spicy broth, or half- and half where where the pot itself has a divider down the middle....  They have a huge non hot pot menu but I've never tried anything from it."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice service staff. Lots of variety. Maybe a bit overpriced in comparison to other Asian restaurants in the area, but few offer shabu shabu. The environment isn't incredible, but one of the nicer places to rest on State Street. However, be wary; sometimes the manager's kids will be in and crying."}
{"text":"It was my first time to the restaurant and I gotta say it was pretty good.  I got the shabu shabu buffet for $25.99 (I think) and I said it was worth it... Although I wished they had tofu... all the items that looked like tofu were some kind of fish item.  Nonetheless it was still good.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Quite authentic chinese food, and while I didn't have the Shabu Shabu itself, I really enjoyed the dishes I got from them. I tried the Garlic Eggplant and the Sesame Chicken. Both were quite delicious! They are priced a bit on the higher side, but I think it's because they expect you to eat family style. The portions were quite large, and I could easily split the dishes 2 ways, so if you think about it, it's actually quite cheap!  I've never tried their delivery, but I definitely plan to in the future. Recommend this for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant on State Street. It's up this long creaky stairway, but it's worth the climb. I promise. We have walked by this place a hundred times and keep telling ourselves to go there. I'm so glad we did. We started with an order of crab rangoon. This was the best order of crab rangoon that I have had. The exterior was so crunchy and chewy at the same time. They were a bit hot, but so creamy and meaty in the middle. The order is perfect for 2-3 people. Next, I ordered the vegetable mei fun (spicy) as I like a little heat in my noodles. It came packed full of a variety of vegetables and had a pretty good base of heat. It probably was the best veggie mei fun that I've had. My dining partner ordered the vegetable lo mein (spicy) and claimed that it was awesome. I'll definitely be back, as I hear that this place may have hot pot. I love hot pot. The restaurant has this vintage church basement feel to it. Great space available for groups. It looked like they had buffet tables. I may have to come back to try their buffet. That may be a great way to try a variety of their entrees."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But the chef changed, and the owner changed, and I stopped going there. But this 1 star review is not about their food, which is not so bad. It is about their delivery service, which is HORRIBLE!!! Worst delivery experience I ever had in Madison, and the excuse is beyond imagination.  Today they have reopened after renovation. We placed an order via Ricepo at 5:20. We received a call 5 minutes later, informing us that the pancake for Peking duck has run out. We said it's fine. Then the waiting started.   The estimation time for delivery is 45~60, which is pretty standard. We waited till 6:40 and called to ask whether the delivery is on its way, and the guy who answered said he had to check with the kitchen. He never called back. We made another call at 6:50, that's when he told us that our food isn't prepared yet, claiming they're having a busy day, so they never started cooking any delivery order, and that they'll probably start doing it in half an hour.  This is plainly outrageous. They ignored our order (and many other's for that matter) for 1.5 hours, did nothing about it (not one call asking if we are ok with waiting  2.5 hours for food), and they don't even feel there is anything wrong about that.  So, clearly Soga can't handle more than one thing at a time. Cooking for incoming guests and delivery orders can't happen at the same time. I assume that as long as they have people coming in their restaurant, they'll treat your delivery order like it doesn't exist. If you are fine with that, please go ahead and order. If they somehow have time to prepare your food during regular dinner time, I guess that would imply no one goes to their place anymore. If you are fine with that, please go ahead and order."}
{"text":"The shabu shabu here has to be one of my favorites. The spicy broth has this amazing delicate flavor while still packing a punch. It's affordable too."}
{"text":"GO TO ASIAN KITCHEN RIGHT OFF STATE STREET INSTEAD  One of the worst chinese food places I've ever tried in Madison. Not only was the service equivalent to the pace of gary the snail on Spongebob Squarepants, but the food was especially inedible and disorganized. I came to Soga Shabu Shabu with five friends on a Sunday night. There were probably five full tables in total, yet it took us about an hour and a half at the restaurant. We ordered dumplings to start, yet my friend's full mean arrived before our appetizer. Then, my meal came about 10 minutes before my other friends, so my food was cold by the time hers arrived.   I split the house lo mein and sweet and sour chicken with a friend. The lo mein was decent, not good, but thrived in comparison to the sweet and sour chicken we ordered. The sweet and sour chicken arrived as fried chicken with sweet and sour on the side as if we were at a Popeyes. If i wanted boneless wings I would have gone to Brat's on State Street. Upon asking the waiter to fix our meal, he gave us a difficult time, and our food was still gross.   Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food! Seems more authentic than most! The shrimp lo mein and the crab rangoons were delicious! Good portion sizes. Nice staff! The main issue was that it was sometimes difficult to place an order because most of the staff did not speak English very well. You also had to walk up 25 steps to get to be restaurant which is difficult to impossible for individuals with disabilities. But otherwise, a very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered delivery from Soga through Grub Hub and I was very pleased! Grub Hub emails and texts you delivery time and lets you know when your food is out for delivery, which is nice.   Reasonably priced. The food arrived in nice, tightly-closed containers and was still piping hot. I tried the eggplant with garlic sauce, which was very flavorful and delicious, although a little oily. My friend ordered the shrimp fried rice and enjoyed it. Overall, I'd order from them again. I wish they offered small versions of their soup (all soup was meal-sized)."}
{"text":"My wife is mainland Chinese from Guanzhou, so she knows this cuisine inside and out.  I took her here for our anniversary yesterday.  We ordered noodles in a hot sauce for appetizer ($8),  a duck entree ($20)  and a lamb with peppers entree ($20).   The food came quickly--too quickly--for it to have been cooked-to-order.  The noodles were thick, slippery chunks of gelatin, nearly impossible to grab with chopsticks (even for my wife!) and impossible to keep on a spoon (the only utensil they supplied).  The gelatinous noodles had been laid to rest in a sauce that wasn't bad, but seemed to be nothing more than grated chili peppers in broth.  Within 5 minutes of ordering, the peppered lamb came out.  It consisted of a few thin strips of grayish meat surrounded by onions and peppers in a mystery sauce that was without taste.  The meat could have been lamb, it could have been beef, it could have been pork.  But whatever it's dim origins, it was tasteless, tough and rubbery.  Have these people not heard that lamb is succulent, laced with delicious veins of fat and, when properly cooked, falls apart with a fork?  I guess not.  My wife was appalled and kept saying \"You buy me lamb--I can cook better than this!\"  The duck came out a few moments later and this was truly a deceptively-named dish.  The \"duck\", such as it was, consisted of a dozen pieces of duck neck bones languishing amongst wilted and sad Chinese cabbage (or something) in the same nondescript sauce as the lamb came in.  No other part of the duck was found in this dish, even with diligent searching.  No breast, no wings, no thigh, no... nothing.  My guess is that the proprietors enjoyed the delightful, fatty duck breast the night before and saved the duck necks for the first hapless guest who ordered duck instead of throwing them out.  But more than this initial misnaming, the dish, which appeared to be piled high with duck meat, in reality had chunks of blood sausage underneath, propping up the duck necks.  I don't care for blood sausage at the best of times, but this mass of congealed blood was foul and repelling.  Why blood sausage?  I do not know.  Maybe it was cheap.  Maybe it was left over from the proprietors' dinner a few weeks before.  Whatever the reason, the plate of \"duck\" was nothing more than a lie.  Even if I liked blood sausage, which I don't,  I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I was in the mood for duck ad if duck was what I ordered and if duck was what I paid for.  My wife was disappointed.  Me, too.  The sad dessert bar had nothing but a half dozen kinds of fruit in sugar syrup straight out of a Dole can and poor, hardened little cakes that were only waiting for the close of the business day to be put out of their misery.  Summary: The food was pricey. Nothing was very tasty. The entrees were misnamed and/or deceptively arranged. Nothing was very appetizing when served. Nothing was yummy when eaten. That's what I got for my fifty bucks."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. The special clay pot is superb! A good dish to order especially in Fall and Winter."}
{"text":"Not bad. However, please discuss your order with waitress. The reason is some dishes are really different from what you think."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on an upper floor of an older building on State Street. Upon entering at street level, you climb a long flight of stairs that are lit up on either side by a string of blue rope lights. I kind felt like I was on my way to a disco, haha.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress who seated us immediately. It was late in the afternoon and very quiet in the restaurant.  We ordered the wonton soup and sesame chicken with fried rice. The wonton soup was very good, and the sesame chicken was ok. I'm not a fan of breaded chicken anyway, but it didn't excite me. The fried rice was disappointingly on the cool side. The 3 pieces of broccoli that were on the side of the plate were also cold. I didn't eat any of the egg roll, but was told that it was steamy hot and tasted good.  Before the food arrived I visited the washroom to wash my hands, and was aware of just how old this building is! The restroom could really use some attention. I love old and historic buildings and have absolutely nothing against that, but it seemed quite dilapidated and dirty. I was thankful for the motion sensored paper towel dispenser, as I was viewing how dirty the light switch plate was. I seriously don't know when the last time it had been wiped down.   And the wall I was seated against had a taped up hole. I'd be willing to visit again and try something on the menu that is more suited to my taste. I would also love to see them put a little more effort into fixing the \"tacky\" aspects of the interior and scrubbing the place up a bit."}
{"text":"OMG!! Our order took over an hour and a half and when it came, it was totally the wrong food! We've eaten from this place before and loved the food, but the last 2 times have been a nightmare ordering over the phone and now tonight. I am waiting for someone to call me back and tell me my debit card has been credited back! And now it's too late to get and eat anything else without acid reflux!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I liked that we were able to split the broth between vegetable based and meat based. I wish there were more vegetable options for hot pot."}
{"text":"In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.  My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed.   I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great.   The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way.   I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.  While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense."}
{"text":"Too many gatherings and birthday parties have been held here by me and my friends. We just love hanging out at this place so much. One of the biggest factors may be due to the location. Located on State Street, this place has shabu-shabu. As a regular myself, I can say that they have quite selection of meats and veggies, but the soup is not consistently good.  The service is the same thing: inconsistent. We just hope that we would have a nice waitress so we could have a nice moment. Other time, the waiter/tress could be so rude and forgot to fill in our glass. However, there are some nice waitresses that can do their work well.  The lady owner seemed to be overly friendly to a specific race. But one time, my girlfriends and I witnessed a scene when we were having our shabu-shabu. The lady owner was yelling to a bunch of students in her native language. It was quite intense and lasted for almost 15 minutes. One of my girlfriend who speaks the language translated to us. And it was due to some misunderstanding. Too bad, it should not have caused some bad and intense scene that could ruin the atmosphere.  Since then, I haven't been back. But I know, I will as some of my friends are really crazy about this place and this is a strategic meeting point!"}
