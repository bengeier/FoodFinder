{"text":"Another trip to Old World deli and as always NOT a disappointment . Their Gyros are killer and the sauce is awesome! The owner was so nice! We walked in about 2 minutes before closing not knowing they close early on Saturday. No problem they cheerfully made us two king size gyro meals to go (King size has #1 of meat, no kidding) We also got some of their traditional  Greek style baklava and the Lebanese style, .All wrapped up well and out we went happily on our way back to Parma. It was still hot when we got home. .My son and I enjoyed our gyros and there was plenty of mine left to share with my two small dogs, they loved it too! Needless to say there will be many trips to OLD WORLD deli in the future. Great Job, only wish you were a little closer."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Asked for a breadless Reuben. Owner was very sweet and ready to get me what I asked for. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The gyro was awesome, and theÂ tzatziki sauce hit all marks for taste. The service was friendly and very interested in customer satisfaction. Loved the Tabouli!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place staff is friendly . They have the best gyros I have had in a long time. I ordered a large gyro It fed two of us. It was approximately seven inches long and weighed about a pound!  The portions are generous. gyro meat was tender and juicy, lettuce,tomatoes and onions , in a warm pita .The sauce was served on the side. They have a variety of deli sandwiches, salads, and mediterranean desserts.  I love the baklava. Will be going back there for the price and the quantity is worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly people, exceptional service... My wife had the Greek Salad and I had the Grilled Chicken Salad. Because we were hungry we also decided to split a Reuben Sandwich. Well, the salads were fresh and crisp....served with dressings that tasted like they were home made. The very generous Reuben contained the best sauerkraut, corned beef & was served with the dressing on the side. It was the very best! Highly recommend this place for the great food. Very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"First of all the food is so delicious!! All 5 of us enjoyed every bite. The staff is wonderful and funny and make you feel very welcomed!  Wish we weren't just passing through."}
{"text":"The is a great deli all the way around!  We ordered catering from here with delivery to make life easy and everyone said everything was delicious and to order from them again.   This deli has all of your go to deli sandwhichs from turkey, pastrami, salami, roast beef and along with gyros.   If you are looking for a go to deli in the area and one that delivers for catering this is your spot."}
{"text":"Best gyro's in town! That's all I ever get so that's all I can speak for. Well I did have a corned beef sandwich once and it was pretty good. I've been carrying out here for years and have never had a bad experience. Great for lunch or a grabbing a quick dinner on the go."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Brunswick!!  The gyros are literally the best.  Love the owners,  they are friendly and caring."}
{"text":"I love the gyro's here. The service is always great. I came today after hours by mistake (didn't even check before coming, my mistake) and the owners were st I here and made me an awesome gyro and some fries. I'll keep coming back and recommending it!"}
{"text":"Best deli south of Cleveland! This is an office staple for us. Awesome family feel, extremely courteous staff always willing to share a few jokes with you, can't beat the prices and their selection is fantastic. They also do gyros and some Greek food. Don't skimp on desert either! Definitely go check out the Old World Deli for a satisfying lunch experience!!!!"}
{"text":"One word... Awesome...  Had the corned beef with Swiss, brown mustard, and horse radish..."}
{"text":"Went today for St. Patrick'c Day. My wife had The New Yorker and potato pancakes and I had the Reuben. The line was out the door but it was worth the wait. Potions were generous, food was hot and the people were nice under the pressure. It had a real family feel the owner, his wife and their mom were cranking out the corned beef. Would go back again to try the GYRO which people were still ordering even today!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Customer service was very friendly. Food was delicious. Bathroom was clean. I had the gyro, it the best I've ever had! The onion rings and fries were good and fresh. Next time I will have the corn beef."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in, even though I have lived in Brunswick for 25 years. Excellent employees and ownership. That's the first thing I noticed. Nextly, the king-sized gyro was MASSIVE. This is a good thing! I hate having to order two regular sized items when I'm starving. But they have smaller sized gyros for those with smaller appetites. The food itself was excellent! I will update this review when I try some more new things. Must-tries: - Gyro - New Yorker sandwich"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. The sandwiches are fantastic I love the grilled chicken wrap. My husband absolutely loves the Gyro and the homemade sauce.everything is made fresh to order here."}
{"text":"This is probably the fastest review I've ever done after eating out. We figured we would try the Old World Deli based on Yelp reviews, as we are passing through the area. My wife and I are so glad that we gave it a try. I had the Sicilian sub which is a Meatball Parmigania  sub and my wife had corned beef two ways. Her sandwich was piled high with meat. One half of a sandwich had coleslaw on it. I think it was called the New York corned beef sandwich and I don't know what the other side was but she usually doesn't eat her whole lunch when we go out. She devoured the entire sandwich. My meatball sub was perfect. Meatballs tasted homemade sauce was excellent the bread is excellent I don't know how else I can describe it. Sheer Perfection. We had two pieces of baklava and each was a different style of baklava. Also outstanding. Excellent value excellent quality excellent experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and good prices. Sandwiches not to big, not to small...just right.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Loved the food!! Andy and Rhonda provided the catering for my mother's 70th birthday party. The one thing that every guest agreed on was how amazing the food was!!   Andy and Rhonda were amazing to work with. The food arrived on time, hot and soooo delicious! We ordered a range of dishes from the a la cartel section of their catering menu including 2 salads (so fresh, full of veggies, and plenty of dressing), pierogies, kraut and kielbasa, chicken tenders, meatballs, etc. My only regret is that we didn't order more! The guests were heading up to the buffet for multiple plates and everything went quick!  The prices and taste are the best in town!! I would definitely recommend Old World Deli for your next catered event!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place, the gyros are awesome and the owner and his family are always super pleasant. Best deli on the south side of Cleveland"}
{"text":"There is no where in Brunswick where you can get a better sandwich or gyro! This is a family owned business and everything is amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place after craving a good deli spot. After reading the reviews we had to give it a try : this place truly does make you feel like family. They take the time to answer any questions while providing you their recommendations on what you might like to try depending on your mood. This type of service is far and few now and days. Usually your rushed to place an order. Not here!!  I had the corned beef, pastrami and Swiss combo sandwich and my husband had the gyro. For sides we tried the potato pancakes and fries. Everything was awesome!! We will definitely be frequenting this place more often."}
{"text":"Family owned, friendly service, fresh and tasty food made to order.  Can't wait to come back and try something new.  I had the Gyro and my husband had the Rueben."}
{"text":"awesome place! First visit since moving to Hinckley. and not our last. It's a hidden gem. Best place around to grab a yummy sandwich. Had the Reuben and hubby had the Gyro. Kiddo has a grilled cheese. Owners are so sweet! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for lunch because it has a five star review on Yelp.  I was not disappointed. It is run by a family who makes you feel like a part of them from the minute you walk in. The food is delicious, but the best part about this restaurant is the fact that you feel like they care, which in today's world is priceless!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati and I always stop here for my corn beef fix! Best corned beef in all of greater Cleveland!"}
