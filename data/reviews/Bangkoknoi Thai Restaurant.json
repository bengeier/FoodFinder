{"text":"Tasty food but the rice was way overpriced. A large coconut rice is $10 and a steamed rice $9. Pretty small too."}
{"text":"The Bangkoknai is my favourite place to go for Thai in Calgary.  I'm a big fan of Mussaman beef curry. The beef was a little overdone the most recent time I've been there but the sauce sure made up for it. It's amazing.  A great array of appetizers ... we sampled from the calamari, the spring rolls and the salmon. The two former were served with a delicious sweet Thai chili dipping sauce.  The service is friendly and attentive but my favourite part about the restaurant is probably the serving dishes. They're old and classic Thai, complementing the ambience."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine Thai restaurant with all the classics (Massaman curry, crying tiger, basil chicken, Tom Yum, etc) and average prices. Not a destination restaurant, but good for a Thai cravings fix."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times w friends due to the location convenience.  Friendly staff and great menu variety.  Price is a bit high given the small food portion.  Most of the dishes are flavourful and just like how Thai food should taste like, not the best but definitely above average compared to  other restaurants in town. One thing tho, I always found coconut rice has too much coconut milk and tastes a bit undercooked .."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago based off a recommendation from a friend.  It is in my opinion the most authentic tasting Thai food I have eaten in Calgary. Portions are well sized and priced very fairly. I think they could get away with charging a bit more and I would be ok with it. Always happy to eat here and I recommend it to others.   If you don't have time to eat in the call ahead for take out."}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant, has some decent decor that isnt bad. Kitchen is extremely clean which is a good sign from this kind of place.  Service was brutal, entree dishes came out sporadically over the course of 20-30 minutes (the restaurant wasnt busy) but the food was good and had loads of flavours. They cheap out and use crappy frozen veggies in their dishes which i think is pathetic considering it takes 30 minutes to cut a bunch of Carrots and broccoli up. Lazy to the enth degree.   I wouldnt go back, the food would be fine as a take out but the service was brutal and im not a fan of restaurants cheaping out on simple things like Veggie prep."}
{"text":"Every day on the way to work, I always see Bangkoknoi and think \"I should go there one day!\" One day finally came when both my sister and I were craving Thai food, and we were in for a treat! Arriving around dinner, we were expecting it to busy but there was only one other table occupied. That worked out of us because got pretty prompt service.  We got the papaya salad to start, the chicken pad thai and green curry with coconut rice to share for our entree.  I love papaya salad. Grated papaya with carrots and tomatoes tossed in a spicy Thai dressing, then topped with toasted cashews and shrimp. Honestly, I'd have this as my entree if I could! Both the pad thai and the green curry were equally as delish! Very flavorful and not overwhelming with spice.  Seeing how we could enjoy our meal because we weren't being rushed out, we were able to make room for dessert too - deep fried ice cream. Seriously, if you've never had it you need to try it! Ice cream inside deep fried dough in a caramel like glaze and topped with nuts. The size of the dessert was perfect and hit the spot.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything you get from here. We saw the coconut shrimp skewers the other table ordered just as we were leaving - I know what I'm getting next time I come back!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt a restaurant above the rest!!!! I went on line for delivery with a so called company that handles these things (I have voiced my opinion on that area) not to take away from the delivery screw up one of the owners brought it himself to my house It gets better the food was the ultimate in Thai Food fresh clean flavours omg I never rant but this is fantastic  Please give this a try u will be impressed  Thanks for ur time Shannon Peever"}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday. We hadn't been here for quite some time and I didn't recall it being that great.   However this time around we asked the server to suggest some dishes for our group and they were all very good!   I wish I took some notes or photos of the different dishes, but they were all fresh, tasty, and unexpected. Surprisingly there was only one traditional curry in our order.   Coconut soup, chicken satay, beef and potato curry, and more. If you want an adventure ask the server to suggest a couple of dishes. They may not be what you expect, but in our case it turned out very well!!"}
{"text":"Best coconut rice in the city. There. If you don't read any further, you will know at least one reason to come here.   I hadn't been here for s few years, so when my friend suggested we come back a couple of weeks ago I couldn't resist! My memories of the food paled in comparison to the real thing. In fact, they seem to have only gotten better at Bangkoknoi.   Centre street abounds with all sorts of Asian restaurants, but there isn't much Thai in the area. However, this place certainly makes up for it by packing plenty of flavor into each dish. This well-established restaurant has got it all figured out, so don't hesitate to be adventurous and try something new.   The staff here are always friendly and very helpful, plus the food comes out quickly. Next time you are craving Thai, bring your appetite and some friends!"}
{"text":"It is hard to satisfy many palates in one sitting, but I have found Thai food tends to have something for everyone.  There is Matsuman curry (usually beef and potatoes) for those who insist they are \"meat and potatoe\" people, vegetable only stir fries for vegetarians, all different levels of spice, and a very good assortment of meats as well.  So, it only made sense to find a Thai place when in Calgary on a family visit with 6 family members who all require something different for their \"ideal meal\".          We had heard good things about this restaurant from my Aunt who works downtown and has many office mates who usually go here for lunch.  We found the place easily and were seated quickly.  The decor is pretty basic, but clean.  We each ordered a dish to share and ended up with a large variety of food:  spring rolls, salad rolls, pad Thai, a chicken stir fry, two vegetarian dishes and a green curry.  We enjoyed every dish but the one that stood out was a vegetarian eggplant dish.  Eggplant is not my favorite vegetable, but this eggplant was smokey garlicky stir fried perfection that had us all eying for the last bite.       This bill was reasonable and we all left full and satisfied.  I would eat here again if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Crying Tiger Beef. Why is the tiger crying? Probably because the epic sauce that comes with it doesn't exist in the world of tigers. Sorry tigers, you'll just have to eat your meat raw.   Myself, on the other hand, am still only a small step away from crying because I can't put the crying tiger beef sauce on everything, every single day. I'm so happy we chose to order it despite that it's actually a salad. This is one kickass salad. It's slices of beef and sauce. Sauce so good you'll actually look forward to eating the lettuce on your plate. It tastes like a sweet and peppered soy sauce marinade. Like your favourite thai sweet chilli made sweet sweet love to salty soy.  We went on a Friday evening and there were only 3 other customers in the restaurant. It's a nice place to go if you want some alone time with the person you're dining with. Albeit awkwardly quiet alone time. Turn up those sexy thai-pop jams, please! If things get weirdly silent, the room is covered in plenty of interesting wooden thai carvings to entertain you.   Also a good spot go go with a large group of people, because there will be room for you to sit! Thai food is better for sharing anyway.  I loved the panang as well. While I wouldn't say this place has the best food, nor the best value going, if you're in the area, it's still a great place to stop for a meal."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant after going to a place on the same block at around lunch time on a weekday.  It was a quiet little Thai restaurant even during lunch time so I know we were taking our chances eating here.  To our surprise, the food was quite good.  The Satays were outstanding and I highly recommend them.  We also had a decent Pad Thai wrapped in a egg as well, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  When we were there, there was only one server and a single cook.  Needless to say, the service could have been better and the food took a little long to arrive.  However, overall I think I would definitely come back for a second visit if I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but I love the decor/atmosphere of this place.  It's cool.  In terms of food, my dishes have always been great, but I haven't strayed much with Tai.  I really enjoy coconut rice as well as curry dishes and chicken with cashews.  They certainly don't disappoint me here."}
{"text":"Nice very quiet atmosphere,  conducive to my evening meal and reflection time.  Ordered the spicy noodles with chicken and the spring rolls as a starter.  The spice level was just right for my taste buds.  Ample amount of meat with lots of fresh vegetables and noodles.  Waitress was very nice and attentive.  Would recommend this place for Asian meal."}
{"text":"The decor can seem dated but the staff is always friendly and the menu is great. Ask what the fish is that day and you may be surprised.   It's certainly not the best Thai place in town but it's a quick fix close to the north side of Downtown."}
