{"text":"The Mr. and Mrs. invited Older Son and his Wife to dinner.  As they live in Piper Glen, the Mr. thought it would be a great occasion to try for the first time this neighborhood restaurant in the Trader Joe's strip mall.
The menu appears to be a pedestrian selection of somewhat generic Italian food, but on a four-day holiday weekend we did not want to travel through Black Friday-shopper traffic to go farther afield.
The Mrs. made reservations, as this was an unknown locale.  We arrived on time and were seated at our table.  Even though they were not busy at such an early dinner hour, it took a while to be served for drinks.  It also took a while for the waiter to approach us for our food order.  We knew what we wanted, but the waiter was prepared to walk away and return when we were 'ready'.  We had to call him back.  As mentioned above, the Mrs. worried that the pedestrian menu offerings meant not-quite-tasty antipasti or salads, so we forwent ordering any.  We ordered the ravioli al formaggio (the ladies), the lasagna, and the penne vodka (with shrimp).
The food appeared on our table very shortly after we ordered.  The Mrs. wonders if they have the food already prepared in the kitchen, just needing re-heating before plating and serving.
The ravioli consisted of six medium-sized, circular non-meat-filled cushions in a very thin-looking 'butter' sauce (with half a small grape tomato and a shred of something green), the lasagna was a messy serving on the plate (and nothing else), the penne vodka had five small shrimp.  Very sparse plating.  The Mrs. was not expecting much, so was surprised that it was tastier than their menu or than the appearance on the plates had led her to expect.  Truthfully, they were very (very) small portions for the money.  The bread and butter appeared on the table some time after our food was served.  Now mind, the restaurant was not that busy at this early dinner hour.
For dessert, the Mr. and Mrs. ordered the Nutella gelato.  It took FOREVER to have this one scoop of gelato, which was loaded with a BIG mound of whipped cream (yuck), delivered to our table.  (THIS they garnish!)  This Nutella gelato was pale in color, very thin-textured, and 'light'-flavored compared to the gelato that the Mrs. used to gorge on when in Italy, but it was not unpleasant.  It was just not that lovely unctuous-tasting, authentic-textured Italian gelato.
Once the check was paid (with a very nice tip), the waiter piled all the plates on top of each other, grabbed the glasses, and told us they needed our table for another party and that we had to go.
The Mrs. was puzzled as there were plenty of other tables empty.  Nothing special about our table, actually two small tables pushed together.  The waiter easily could have pushed together some of the empty tables for the party 'waiting at the bar'.  As we walked out, the Mr. informed the owner that the waiter very rudely told us to leave.  The owner shrugged this off.
The Mrs. informed him that this had been our first visit and would be our last.  The owner did not appear to care.
In the car, the Mr. said we should have asked for the return of our check in order to reduce the tip.  The Mrs. agrees that we should have, though we did not.
We tend to tip well when we go out, though the Mrs. wishes we had not, on this occasion.
(By the way, we do not use Groupon or other coupon deals.)
We do not intend to return.
There are plenty of nice Italian restaurants in Mecklenburg county that serve delicious, abundant food at a good value.  They also have way more courteous service.  And the owners are WAY nicer and more personable.
The Mr. and Mrs. do NOT recommend Rudy's.
."}
{"text":"Food was not bad. Service will prevent use from returning. Tables are too close together. Wait staff inept."}
{"text":"Tried Rudy's tonight and have to say if you really enjoy Little Italy in New York this is not the place and keep on moving.

The portions are small, compared to family style.  They enlist Group on to increase their traffic, instead of appreciating the customers who are willing to sample a wonderful dinner, you are offered minimal portions.  No left over here and you leave hungry!

The eggplant  was just one layer thin, it was cold as ice, the string bean where cold to, we where only given 4 small potatoes.  They do not offer a salad with the meal and charge additional 5.00 for that.  

They will catch you at the end if you check does not equal the amount stated on the Group on and tell you to come back another time to use it,  Are you kidding me?  We decided to order dessert, if we went to Pub lix we could of have a better dessert.  These are not prepared fresh and it was not appetizing ether's 

We also had the lo Lobster Ravioli and it was cold too.  The portion was small and she called it Pink Sauce.  You can purchase better ravioli that are fresh and delicious at Whole Foods.  


Rudy's Italian Restaurant & Bar is as awful a place as I have ever come across. Rudy's has really terrible food, really terrible service, very high prices, and to top it all off, they committed credit card fraud. Allow me to give some details about this dreadful restaurant.

This is crime in Charlotte, buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Based totally on the owner, Rudy's attitude and lack of customer service, I shouldn't have given him any stars at all.

Had an expired Groupon and ordered a take out.  I knew it was only good for face value.. no problem, but Rudy wouldn't honor.  Said it couldn't be take out. Now that makes sense for the original coupon, but not for a face value amount.  I was cordial and he just wanted to tell me how he couldn't make money on this (I'm a customer....do I want to hear this?)

He wouldn't budge and basically just walked away.  I should have done the same, but guess I have more integrity than the owner.  Paid for my take out and will NEVER darken his door again and will tell everyone I know about the attitude I encountered there.  I hope he thinks THAT is worth what it would have cost him to appease a customer with a $20 face value coupon.

Shame shame, Rudy."}
{"text":"We've been to Rudy's five or six times over the last few years.  They are very consistent, service is top notch and its got a great casual yet special dining vibe.  Tonight we went for New Years Eve and had another terrific dinner. We arrived for our reservation at 6:30 and were immediately seated.  We had a salmon appetizer, split a salad, ordered Corvina and Osso Buco and we both had dessert (chocolate mousse and Italian cheesecake).  Everything was terrific and if you like good bread and great coffee, this is the place!  Also, the pacing of the meal was perfect."}
{"text":"The food was decent - nothing extraordinary but tasty.
The service was terrible.
Refills did not occur often.
It took forever for our order to be taken (drink and food).
After we paid our check they started clearing off the drink glasses and told us we needed to go because there was a reservation waiting to be seated. There were other tables finished eating as well as other tables the reservation could have been seated at. 

Very rude. Informed the owner and he did not seem to care.
Will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Okay I'll base my review solely on the food.  I went here with a friend on a visit to Charlotte thinking it would be a great evening of good food.  I was wrong. 

First off, the appetizers, a promising ricotta stuffed mushroom dish, arrived to our table luke-warm.  Really disgusting.  Okay I lied, I must mention the service right quick.  I don't like so-called fine dining establishments where the servers don't use trays and stack your plates on their arms and carry your plates with their thumbs centimeters from your food.

Then the over priced entree came out and let's just say I've had better Italian at Olive Garden.  

All in all I was more than underwhelmed.  Save your money and go to your local OG."}
{"text":"Finally we have a go-to spot for Italian in Charlotte. We've been eating at this restaurant since it opened and have come in for a great meal every time. 

Entrees we love: Penne alla Vodka with shrimp is great, as is the Rigatoni alla Burina. They've just added a Carbonara that reminds me of my mom's and if you go in on a weekend the Osso Buco, a pricey special, is worth it! 

Delicious."}
{"text":"Hand's down, Rudy's is the best Italian in town. Lots of places claim to be the best - and if you say Mama Ricotta's is the best, I swear I will cut you, mercilessly, preferrably in front of your dog - but Rudy's is old school, old country, made from scratch by Nana Italian. 

It's quiet and quaint, and, mercifully, the music's turned down low enough for one to enjoy a conversation with friends and family at the dinner table. I mean, I don't mind a little mandolin and Mario Lanza, but if I have to hear \"Santa Lucia\" sung by some insipid Italin pop starlet at full volume, well, then, I'm gonna have to use some freeze-dried manicotti from Trader Joe's next door as a weapon of mass destruction. So, yeah, perfect atmosphere, if you ask me.

Lots to choose from. The calamari tastes like actual calamari, the squid and octopus as if theyd just been fished out from the Mediterrean. Oh, and try the mussels, just small enough to satisfy you as an appetizer, but, be warned, you'll likely stab your table mate's hands with a fork for that last shell.

I absolutely enjoyed the lobster gnocchi. And the fact that the gnocchi was perfectly kneeded was a thrill for me. Enjoy your meal with an endless supply of fresh baked bread, many varieties to choose from. I like to sop my sauce in foccacia. And so should you.

Oh, for those of you that bellyache about your Groupons? Seriously, Groupon at your own risk. Dining establishments take a huge hit when they have to honor these things, and, yeah, they'd rather give you a hard time than comp $30 of your meal, because then you know the waiter's going to get stiffed on a hearty tip he thought was coming his way. Think of those that work in the food service industry that have to feed families of four on what they earn in tips, you heartless bastards."}
{"text":"Went to Rudy's for my Mother's birthday. 

The first weekend we went we could not be seated because they said they were to full and they were only seating customers whom had reservations. 

The following weekend I made sure to set a reservation. We went in on a Saturday night. The restaurant is in a very nice location but it is a very tight room. There isn't barely enough space for the waiters to walk through. 

We were seated, got our drinks, the waiter took our order. He then gave us our food and NEVER came back to check on us. The food was okay nothing special. 

I had to ask one of the Hispanic men that clean the tables for more water. (He was very nice and sweet) 

What brought me to this restaurant was Groupon. The waiter didn't even tell us we could still spend $15.00 more he just gave us our check and rung us up. We still had to pay $5.00 for tax. 

NOT A GOOD BIRTHDAY FOR MY MOTHER."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food is freshly cooked, and wine selection pairs well with entrees. This is our favorite place to eat when we visit family in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Rudy's has earned it's way to our \"go to\" local italian joint.  We love the owner, the service is always great, and the food is on point.  In fact, they will customize their menu for you easily when asked.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the paint job on the inside is a bit much and parking can be a bit of a pain.  However, when my wife and I are thinking local italian, we're thinking Rudy's.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was fair, but the environment was very unpleasant. It was too hot in the restaurant to enjoy the meal. Asked to sit in another part of the restaurant that might be cooler and ended up listening to load/arguing waiters near the kitchen. Would NOT recommend Rudy's."}
{"text":"The food is generally good to very good, but there are 'atmosphere' issues that include-- too much smoking right by the front door and too many folks that appear to be very drunk and are very loud and obnoxious at the bar. One man in particular seems to be there every time we have tried the place and he is truly disgusting.

I"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Rudy's for a while, and we finally got around to it!  This place is awesome.  We went on a Friday around 6:30 and they were pretty busy which is always a good sign!

They brought out fresh-baked bread with a bean salad to put on the bread.  It was delicious.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  They have a decent wine list, so we ordered a bottle of wine - prices are reasonable as well.  My husband got the Caesar salad to start and I just picked at his since I didn't want to eat a whole salad in addition to my meal.  It was pretty good.

I ordered the fettuccine Bolognese and it was so delicious - I am still dreaming about it!  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was so flavorful and delightful.  He got the lasagna and it was good, but on the smaller side of a normal portion fyi, so he was glad he had the salad to start.  We both cleared our plates - I can't remember the last time I finished an entire meal!  

We decided to go ahead and order dessert which isn't something we normally do, but everything was so delicious and we were enjoying the night so much, we decided to just go ahead and ruin our diets for the night.  I got the canolis and they were perfect - reminded me of the canolis I grew up eating in NY.  Husband got the NY-style cheesecake and loved that as well.  

For the price and quality of food, you can't beat it!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. Prices are very reasonable.Service excellent. For the price and the quality of the food this is a really good deal"}
{"text":"So-so. I give it 3 stars because it was just so-so. I had the eggplant parm and it was average. Sauce was good but eggplant was not very well cooked and seemed a little greasy. I ordered the entree portion of the Alfredo and it was smaller than a childs portion. I would say it was more of a side dish and not an entree. Salad was fresh and the mushroom appetizer was good. Not sure why, but we did not get bread. Most Italian restaurants of this caliber do offer bread!!!"}
{"text":"Rudy's is a wonderful place for Italian food and in one of the most delightful locations. The table bread is really top notch and you'll struggle to not ask for more. 

Nearly every time I visit, I order the spinach manicotti -- it is the best I've ever had, with fresh spinach inside and a beautiful red sauce on top.

While the service is admittedly spotty, it is not without good intentions."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about our experience at Rudy's. The food and service were outstanding. We had a large group and the entire dinner was perfect from start to finish. Thanks to Rudy and his staff for a wonderful experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"We have tried it again and Rudy's Italian Restaurant & Bar is as awful a place as I have ever come across. Rudy's has really terrible food, really terrible service, very high prices, and to top it all off, they committed credit card fraud. Allow me to give some details about this dreadful restaurant.

TERRIBLE food. We ordered two house salads. The menu describes the \"Insalata Rudy's\" as \"Field greens tossed w/diced pears, caramelized walnuts, raisins & gorgonzola honey dressing\". What we got was lettuce w/very unripe, hard and flavorless small cubes of pear. Hardly any walnuts and raisins. And no gorgonzola honey dressing. Instead of any actual salad dressing, the lettuce was coated with oil. Not olive oil. The lettuce was oiled up with unflavored cooking oil. I would guess it was either plain Wesson or canola oil.

VERY HIGH prices. When you look at the real cost that you are paying at Rudy's, you feel like a sucker for paying so much for such lousy food. The real cost includes the menu price, plus tax, plus 15% tip. So for two \"Insalata Rudy's\" you are going to pay over $17.

TERRIBLE food. For an appetizer we ordered the \"Baked artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and spinach in a roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce\". What we got was a few marinated artichokes right out of the marinated artichoke jar that is found on the store shelf. Instead of garden fresh \"Baked artichokes\" we were served unpleasant, sour, vinegary, marinated artichokes. And the \"roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce\" never made it to the plate. No sauce at all. This was a truly terrible, way overpriced dish.

TERRIBLE food. One entrée special was the \"Pan seared Tilapia with a garlic sauce\". The fish was not pan seared, it was baked. It was mushy. It was flavorless and was served without the sauce. 

TERRIBLE service. Our server, first thing, told us that \"tonight was half price martini night\". When our bill came I noticed that we had been charged full price for two unusually expensive martinis. His explanation was that \"half price martini night only applies if you are seated in the bar\".

CREDIT CARD FRAUD. I discovered that a week after dining at Rudy's someone at the restaurant had increased the amount of the credit card charge by 27 %. This was illegally done without my permission and without my knowledge. 

The lessons to be learned from Rudy's is that what you read on the menu or are told by the waiter is not what will be served at the table. Once Rudy's has your credit card, they may try to swindle you (as they did me). At the end of the meal you will have overpaid for appallingly bad strip-mall-food."}
{"text":"I go for the food which has always been good quality and taste. One of the better Italian restaurants in South Charlotte. The ambiance is not great. Service is good."}
{"text":"I found this resatuarant to be expensive according to their portions. I had the Lasagna it was awful it tasted more like ravioli, my husband had the spaghetti and meaballs they were not good, no taste. I will never go back there again.  we left there hungry, they are very cheap with their portions."}
{"text":"We recently picked up a couple of Groupon deals for Rudy's and came back for dinner.  On both visits, we had good service and the food was solid. 

On one visit, we started with the Baccala' fritto ($8.00) which is cod dipped in tempura and pan fried.  It was quite tasty.  4 stars 

For my entree on this visit, I ordered one of the specials of the day which was a lobster ravioli with a creamy sauce. It was tasty with a rich & creamy sauce, but the portion size was rather on the small side.  3.5 stars

For the second visit, we decided to try something new, so we went with the  Mozzarella in carrozza ($8.00)...this was made up of slices of bread stuffed w/mozzarella and anchovy, dipped in egg batter then fried and topped w/puttanesca sauce.  I must admit that I was not 100% sure about it when we ordered it, but we enjoyed it.  3.5 stars 

So, on this visit, I ordered the Pollo allo champagne ($15.00)....this was made up of a chicken breast w/sun dried tomato and artichoke sauteed in a champagne sauce.  The sides for this included string beans and potato croquettes.  This was a tasty dish and I would order it again. 4 stars"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in on a Thursday night recently.  Thursday night is gnocchi night and she loves the stuff.  We also had a groupon to use that was about to expire, so that in part got us in to Rudy's for the first time.  Literally, I have passed by this place 100's of times on my way to Trader Joe's.  I am still not sure what took us so long to come in for a meal.

Anyway, overall it was a great experience.  We had no problem with our groupon, but we did feel the need to order plenty of food to get our full value.  We ordered mussels and baked shrimp as appetizers and the wife got the gnocchi with a tomato sauce, while my main dish was the pan seared rib eye.  The gnocchi can come with up to 5 or 6 different sauces to choose from, but the simple tomato was very tasty.  All dishes were enjoyed, but next time I would probably get a pasta dish instead of the steak. I am pretty picky about my steak after all.  We split the tiramisu for dessert as we were stuffed.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

In the end, we ordered plenty of food to cover the groupon.  We will certainly return more often and order less food, as the portions are sufficient."}
{"text":"Our family met for Mother's Day for my first visit to Rudy's. Nice atmosphere and attentive service. The bread with beans was excellent as a starter with a very good house Cabernet. My dinner entree \"Cannelloni di spinaci\" with marinara sauce was a solid average. Certainly worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Wow........
Wife had the fettuccine with bolognese, amazing. The kid and I split lasagna, Oh my goodness it was incredible. 
Apps were amazing and the wine list was extensive. 
Trying the Italian cheesecake.

The marinara was great!"}
{"text":"Well, we finally made it over to Rudy's. Right in the neighborhood and in the Piper Glen with many of our regular spots. 

A few things earned Rudy's a 3 out of 5 for us: 

Love the bread! Nice and crusty. A little overdone and perfect for their braised white bean mixture. A great surprise. 

Creamy Roasted Mushroom app was bright, earthy and packed full of different cheeses. Great starter. 

The food was great. Bucatini was fresh and full of flavor. Robust and rich. Much like Bucatini should be . A hearty portion but not far too much like many Italian places tend to do. My wife chose the Penne a la Vodka. The best I've had to date.

The service is just a little too \"iffy\" for us to give this place a solid review. The servers were attentive and friendly, but just not attentive when it came to detail. We had a Groupon and there was a slight discrepancy with the price. It made it a little bit hazy on how we were going to pay, what we were paying for and where the price(s) were coming from. 

Our server half-heartedly attempted to explain what our situation with the Groupon was. His best suggestion was for us to buy dessert and make our ticket more \"rounded.\" Although I was clear on what needed to be done, our server could have handled it a little better. Not a deal breaker, but rather confusing for my wife and me. 

Love that this place is in the neighborhood and maybe we'll try again for some takeout! Thanks for the quality food, Rudy's!"}
{"text":"Great Lunch spot!!  Not too crowded, tables are far enough away to have a conversation.  My guest had a flat bread pizza and said it was fabulous, I had the tonno salad which was very enloyable.  Service was excellent, fair prices, food was fresh, I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"CRAP! Ordered multiple different dishes and all of them were lacking immensely. Would NEVER recommend. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because they deliver through FoodieCall.  Food did NOT taste the way Italian food should taste. Very bland. Overcooked. Small portions. ICK. No thanks. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"We ate here a week or so ago and I have to say it was okay. It's nothing either one of us was blown away by but the food was good. We ordered the gnocchi with marinara and the ravioli al formmagio.  Both were good but the stand out was the marinara sauce. I'm rather picky about it and it's probably some of the best I've had in awhile. We also ordered the caprese as an appetizer and again it was good but nothing wonderful. Service was very good as well. For a restaurant in a strip mall setting it was good however the prices are really high considering."}
{"text":"Went Friday on GNO - looks like they only open for dinner.  Solid wine list, nice seating and space.  We got there when they opened at 5 but it filled up quickly.
My friend got the lasagna - terrific.  Unusually light, fresh tasting for lasagna.
I got the special - sea bass with a sublime lemon cream sauce.  How they combined the two, I don't know.  Came with potatoes (perfect crust on them) and seared spinach with garlic.
Desert - tiramisu.  Lovely, espresso soaked, not alcohol laced."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Groupon  for Rudy's that I purchased after reading their menu, seeing a great looking steak, and deciding we could eat there even though I eat Gluten free, and he eats Low Carb.  After reading the reviews and seeing steak was no longer on the menu online, I had little hopes of having a great meal.  I was so wrong! 

They prepared the sole dish for me without any breading or flour, etc and it was delicious!  It came with roasted potatoes and broccoli.  I ate the broccoli and left the potatoes, but they looked very good. My husband had the sausage with sweet peppers and onions... also delicious!  We had read reviews of \"no bread\" (My husband had the bread since I am gluten free... he had three different types of lightly toasted, piping hot bread, with REAL butter, which is always a plus for us!!)  We do not do \"whipped spreads\" or margarine!!  I've been known to carry my own KerryGold butter into restaurants. :)  All our food was great, hot, and our waitress very attentive.  I had coffee which was great (I'm very finicky about coffee and it passed the test... many restaurants do not!)  Also, there was a note on the menu stating that steaks WERE available upon request.

The appetizer with beans, olive oil, basil, etc. was really good... served with the bread, no extra charge.  Parking, which I had read was a problem, actually was very easy.. parked right in front on a Monday evening.

Right next door  to Trader Joes, so easy shopping after dinner. :)  Will definitely go again!

Deducted one star, due to lack of choices for gluten free, low carb eaters but the food offered was great!"}
{"text":"Went for a spur of the moment, 9:00 Friday night dinner with my husband.  Made a reservation but didn't really need to.  

I got the  Insalata di spinaci 7.00 - Tender leaf spinach tossed with roasted peppers,gorgonzola,kalamata olives with crispy pancetta and vinaigrette dressing. -- I don't recall any pancetta on the salad and it was pretty heavy on the oil/dressing.  But it was pretty good.

Then for dinner my husband got the Tortellini di carne 16.00 Meat tortellini w/peas and prosciutto tossed in Alfredo sauce - The prosciutto was a bit weird - big pieces, would've preferred smaller pieces/cut up more.  But he thought the Alfredo was delicious and he is pretty picky.

I got the Red Snapper special with veggies.  This too had a little more oil than I like, but other than that it was really good.  This dish was $26, a little pricier than I would have liked for this place, I should have asked.  Oh well, it was good.

Service was good.  It was late and they were getting prepared for closing and I understood.

We had a special coupon which made it really worth it, not sure if I 'd be back just because there are so many other places to try.  But this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Lunch Today I had Minestrone Soup and the Genovese Panini.  The Minestrone was one of the most unique Minestrone I have tasted.  The Panini was very good - Piled with Mortudella, perfectly balanced with Salame and Asiago - then they put Pesto on the underside of the top piece of bread and a Sun dried Tomato spread on the bottom piece.  Everything tasted very good and as with my other two dines here the  Service was Exceptional!!!  Rudy has always been there and is friendly, polite, appreciative and humble!"}
{"text":"Food was good, could tell everything was homemade. Portion size was fine, but for the price it should include at least a small house salad. Service was good. if you are looking for a quiet, intimate diner this is not the place - it is small and the bar is big and noisy. If you are just looking for good Italian food in a neighborhood place, Rudy's will do!"}
{"text":"okay food, good service, will need to give it another shot for a more thorough review. Was expecting better for the money. It may have been an off night for me or the line staff but.. will wait."}
{"text":"Nice quiet atmosphere, fast service, delicious bread/butter and small pizza for appetizer. My chicken stuffed with proscuttio was very flavorful with a nice wine sauce and served with yummy potatoes and spinach."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to visit on a beautiful Friday night - 70 degree's, clear skies, truly a perfect Southern Spring night. 

First impressions - this was the old Firenza's, and the new owners haven't changed it much. There is still a bar inside and small patio outside. Overall, however, the atmosphere is more casual and inviting now - the updated decor reminds me of \"red sauce\" Italian restaurants in the Northeast (think Pomodoro in Boston or even Mia Francesca's in Chicago) We were seated fairly quickly (big plus!) outside. 

Menu: The menu has a lot of the Italian standards (Penne with Vodka sauce, eggplant rollatini, Chicken Marsala, Calamari) but also some items that are unique (stuffed mushrooms with ricotta and spinach, a fettucine alfredo with shrimp and sun-dried tomato). We ordered the Rudy's salad (greens with a Gorgonzola honey dressing), the calamari, and for our entrees we chose the eggplant rollatini and the frutti de mare. 

Overall quality of the food was very good - fresh ingredients, well prepared. While nothing we ordered was very complex, the chef did a very good job of maximizing the freshness and simplicity of the dishes. Some of the small touches we like - the calamari came with shoestring zucchini sticks that were also lightly breaded. The rollatini was excellent, a decedent dish oozing with cheese (only odd thing is it came with a random medley of veggies). 

Wine list: not exceptional, but a good selection of offerings and reasonably priced by the bottle (per glass costs are a bit high) 

Service: no complaints - our waiter was professional, unobtrusive, and timely. 

Value: thumbs up. We had two entrees a salad, appetizer and a good bottle of wine for under $100. 

Overall, this is now on our list to return to! In particular we want to try the Gnocchi Thursday's, which we have heard are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Really.... I mean Really :|. First off the atmosphere as you enter the establishment feels like a strip center and not a restaurant..... My first thought was well the food must be very good to allow for such a basic interior design plot. 

So we ordered a feast amongst the table of six.... appetizers - wine - salads - and entree's.... 

Course 1 - The Appetizers were amazing. We should have simply ordered a second round and feasted on the calamari. 

Course 2 - The salads were almost as good as the Appetizers. If I were to complain here it would be that they seemed a little short in the \"good stuff factor.\" for example a salad with pears had a minuscule amount of pears in the mixture. I would have thought this was a mistake except we had two of these same salads at the table and one had just a few bits of the pears. My salad was one that I asked them to make off the menu - AWESOME!!!! They drizzled a little Balsamic Vinegar dressing over the salad that was the kind of taste that haunts your taste buds. 

Course 3 - Entree's - Simply put the best part of the meal was over. The entree's were not acceptable on any level. I ordered the special of the day a fish in a lemon sauce.... One side of the filet was about 1 inch thick and poorly cooked and the other side was less than .25 inches thick and over cooked. The sauce was good but not great. The shrimp topping consisted of 1 shrimp! The potatoes were extremely under cooked and the pepper mixture was cooked to a mush like state. All in all this meal was despicable. The meal's around the table were poor presentation and even poorer quality preparation. The veal was very tough - hmmmm. And the lobster fish roll up was a thin layer of a bland fish like outer shell filled with a pasty mealy filling that had the consistency of putty with sand (Putty might have tasted better though.) 

Wine - The wine we ordered was on par with our expectation for a medium priced wine. The wine selection was uninspired and seemed to have had little thought in to the wines incorporated in to the wine menu. 

All in All - The Calamari and Mushroom Caps set a standard of expectations that was not equalled in the Entree's. I would go back only to sit at the bar with a friend and eat some more of the calamari!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place stays in business. We had a problem with one of our dishes and politely explained this to our server. He made a face and said there was nothing he could do. We asked to speak with a manager and the owner actually came over and basically berated us. He seemed to be looking for a confrontation, but we would not oblige. 

I work hard for my money and the last thing I would ever do is give it to an establishment that simply does not care about its patrons. Stay away from this nasty owner and don't give him your business."}
{"text":"I miss Rudy's.  It's not the most well-known Italian Restaurant, and it's certainly not going to provide you with the most \"frills\" on your dining experience, but when you do go, you generally are presented with some very solid food that is certainly in-line from a pricing perspective. If you go, you have to try the Meat Balls.  Seriously - they are ridiculously good.  My wife and I are aficionados, and Rudy's makes the best restaurant made meat balls we have ever had before.  Their Amatriciana is also quite tasty; their menu has it described as spicy, but I always request additional spiciness with my waiter because I really don't feel the normal order has enough heat to move the needle.  Finally, the appetizer pizzas are a nice treat if you are ever looking to start the meal with something a little different or are just going into Rudy's for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on Thursday night at 6 PM; light crowd. Our waiter (Vincent) was appropriately attentive, but not intrusive. We requested a leisurely service pace and had a very nice evening. 

My benchmark for an authentic IT restaurant is a basic Lasagna, and theirs was right on!  Multiple thin pasta layers - perfectly cooked. Wife ordered Gnocchi - their Thursday special - 7 large shrimp cooked correctly, and nicely presented. We started with stuffed mushrooms which were outrageously good especially when paired with their house Chianti. Extra sauce on the plate was completely finished with bread! Yum!

Our only negative was when we overheard the waiter for the next table asking his guests ...\"did you save enough room for dessert?\" Really? What did he expect to hear??? How ridiculous! Kinda like that tired watier expression - \"are you still working on it\". 

We will definitely go back with hope that our very pleasant \"slow night\" experience will be repeated rather than having the experience of \"SOME\" other reviewers."}
{"text":"This place is truly awesome! We are on our second trip and the quality remains high. Ken is the server we always ask for and he works Firdays and Saturdays. Rudy's is only open for dinner. Smallish menu but well executed menu. The Pollo Voldostana is simply amazing, but so too is the lasagna and the Veal. 

If you like Italian just don't miss this place :-)"}
{"text":"I wait patiently for this terrible place to go out of business allowing a real restaurant to occupy the space, just read previous reviews."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for dinner and it wasnt busy at all which was great cause Rudy was there watching the soccer game aling with us and 1 other man. Great to talk to him. Instead of restaurant week special they are doung buy 1 bottle of wine get one free. Outstanding offer. The mushroom appetizer was awesone, the caesar salad with hime made dressing was very good. The stuffed chicken with Risotto was incredible, my wife had the penne pasta with shrimp with the vodka sauce thats her favorite."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sole I've ever had in my life!  The restaurant is just lovely, the waiter could not have been any better!  We thoroughly enjoyed the bread and the white beans that came with it.  I have a birthday coming up and will have my party at Rudy's!  Just a fabulous dining experience!"}
{"text":"Am I wrong? So, I have an expired Groupon - cost $25 (Groupon was $55).  I was not asking for them to accept the $55 face value - I get that. But they wouldn't accept it for take out. I am solo and just wanted to use my $25 for a take out. I was planning to have a glass of wine while I waited and I always tip well. I purchased the Groupon originally because I really like Rudy's but I was unable to organize a group to go before it expired. Would it have been so hard for them to make an exception to their rule and let me use my $25 (which I've already spent) for a nice dinner at home?  I'm reconsidering Rudy's and am reconsidering Groupons in general."}
{"text":"We went to Rudy's on the last night of the Groupon expiration ..why do we always wait till the last day? I made a reservation through Open Table and had to change the time twice - they were very accommodating. Our expectations were not high because we knew that they would be busy and they were. However, they seemed to be prepared for it unlike other establishments on the last night of a Groupon.  The food took a little longer than usual but that was expected. 

I like their food. This was my 2nd time here. I ordered the sole and couldn't wait
to taste the sautéed sole with cherry tomatoes and roasted peppers. When it came to the table,  I remembered that their \"sautéed\" is actually breaded and pan-fried. It was actually very good, however there is a difference between the two preparations and it's disappointing that they don't fully disclose the preparation on the menu. 

Hubby had the lobster ravioli  which was very good as well. The kids had penne with marinara and penne with vodka sauce, both of those were good. However, this is really not the place for kids, unless you don't mind paying $15 for the kids meals (because there are no kids meals). The only reason we took the kids was that it was hubby's birthday. 

The only dissappointing part of the meal was the dessert. We should have asked
If they were made in house. I don't believe they are. We ordered the Italian Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse. Neither of these were anything to write home about. 

Rudy's is a little higher on the prices than I would like but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Great Italian at reasonable prices. The atmosphere is casual and the service was great. I'm absolutely in love with their vodka sauce which starts at $16 and you can add shrimp or chicken to it for only $2 more. Tried my boyfriends lasagna which was good but I prefer more ricotta in mine. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for nice Italian meal and that's what I got.  They have a nice selection of wines from the Piedmonte area. The food was exquisite-  I got the lasagna that was was flavorful.  Really good sauce and plenty of meat.    I should've gone with my gut though and got what my girlfriend did.  She got the Vodka Penne with shrimp... Was delicious and they creamy vodka sauce was amazing.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimp is always a favorite .  Prices are very reasonable so I am sure I will be back and may be getting the Vodka Penne next time :)"}
{"text":"Saw the lively patio one evening and decided to give this place a try. I haven't tried everything there, but Carciofi al formaggio (artichokes with goat cheese red peppers) is an awesome app and some of my favorite pasta I've had anywhere is the Amatriciana, but I ask for it with Rigatoni pasta, and the Tiramisu is a great ending to the meal. Good wine selection and nice bar area if you don't want a full meal too."}

Listen, this place is located near Piper Glenn in a shopping center, but don't let looks fool you.  The food is top notch.  The service is excellent!  The wait staff caters to you as if you were the only customer in the restaurant.  Not a cheap place to eat, but not too expensive and well worth the spent money.  You will leave satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them another star but couldn't because they are missing an Italian staple - no garlic rolls or garlic knots or garlic bread.  The service was average to bad.  The food was pretty good we had a mushroom appetizer that was really good.  We got a linguini for dinner that was pretty good ended with a desert (chocolate lava cake) that was good.  I just can't justify more stars when they are missing the garlic rolls."}
{"text":"Normally when you say Italian, I am already at the table, fork and knife in hand and a huge napkin tucked into my shirt.

Rudy's is a great cozy restaurant in the Ballantyne area next to Trader Joe's.  I remember the restaurant as being something else when I was in high school (probably Spanish or Italian)... but anyways.

We met some family friends here and had a table of 6.  There is a nice bar area of which we tried the bartenders \"best\" vodka martini (gibson style (with pearl onions instead of olives)).  Boozed up already, it was a nice start to a nice evening of good company.

Our table ordered 2 calamari fritti which were good... my favorite part about the appetizers were the zucchini strips mixed in with the calamari... the breading wasn't especially heavy or oily... it was just right.

I had veal scallopini which was a little on the tough side... maybe it was due to the cut, but still good with the quartered small red potato that comes with the side.

I want to come back here and try there pasta!

We all had some sort of gellato (which was awesome) and I had a much needed coffee.

All in all a great place for Italian.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! Our server was very knowledgable & attentive. Everything we ordered tasted AMAZING! The calamari was crispy, the caprese salad was fresh & delicious. I ordered the ravioli--it was so good I honestly considered ordering seconds! The sauce was so light & the pasta was full of flavor. My husband ordered the sausage & peppers dish & said it was \"perfect\"! We also ordered the lemon cake for dessert--so refreshing! And the foam on my cappuccino was thick & fluffy like a dream...seriously, I cannot say anything bad about our experience! We will definitely be adding Rudy's to our faves list!"}
{"text":"Very family italian atmosphere.    Great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with this place.  Went there on A Saturday night and although there was a decent crowd, we were seated right away at 7:30...not a good sign.  I had a stuffed porkchop.  It was really over cooked, like shoe leather.  The side that comes with it, and apparently every other entree in mashed potatoes that is dished out of an ice cream scoop.  There wasn't a vegetable, no pasta, just mashed potatoes at an 'Italian' restaurant.  For $75 for my wife and I, I expect a lot more."}
{"text":"I had the swordfish special and my boyfriend had the veal shank special (osso bucco). Wow! Best Italian in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Firenze, the restaurant to previously occupy Rudy's space, was my favorite Italian restaurant in town.  If I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was eating at Firenze, with a different name, and a lower price point.  Rudy's Rocks!!

We were seated promptly, though we had no reservation and the restaurant was packed.  The freshly baked bread is outstanding.  A variety of garlic focaccia, grain bread, and sour dough.  The white beans in olive oil are so good you will want to eat them out of the dish!

We began by sharing the Caprese salad as well as the funghi ripieni.  The Caprese was outstanding, with basil a'plenty.  My boyfriend raved and raved over the mushrooms, while I found the cream sauce to be a bit overwhelming.  They were decadent, no doubt.

For my entree, I chose the sauteed sole with capers and olives in a pinot grigio sauce.  This was a large portion for under $17.  So large, I could only eat half.  It is one the top seafood dishes I 've had at a restaurant.  Nice and tangy from the wine sauce. We shared the tiramisu for dessert and enjoyed the best cappuccino I have ever had.  I like it heavy on the foam.  I like my lady fingers a bit more soaked, but it was very good.  Over all, I can't wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu.  Excellent service, unstuffy atmosphere, fantastic food."}
{"text":"Just ok 
Because i am half Italian and know Italian food since long ago. May i give second  try"}
{"text":"Pretty close to New York Italian that's I've had so far since we moved here. Looks like a typical neighborhood joint. I believe the waiter's name was Jess and he was awesome. He was knowledgeable and had great suggestions on the food that he thinks that we would've liked, from what we told him. It was Monday and they offer a \"Buy a bottle, get a free bottle of wine\". It was a great deal. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and they were very simple with what I think was an Alfredo sauce. They were good, nothing to write home about. We were given the typical bread basket, which had the BEST BREAD WE'VE HAD HERE SINCE WE MOVED FROM New York! It was warm and crispy and soft inside, great texture and the butter was soft, not like a fuckin rock, which is the way it normally comes. They also give you a little dish of cannelloni bean salad. It's beans with tomatoes, red onions, and a nice dressing of olive and vinegar. Delicious with that bread!! So, we both had veal dishes. Mine was Piccata and it came with potatoes. Frank had the Marsala. Let me say, the veal was nicely pounded thin and like butter!!! Didn't need a knife. My piccata sauce was Devine! It was buttery and winey and tangy. My potatoes were perfectly roasted and were crispy and creamy inside. Frank's veal was just as tender, but the rest of the dish lacked flavor. It would've been great if it had more salt or garlic or if the sauce had more Marsala. Overall, we enjoyed it and we'd definitely be back. Id love to try their pasta next time. It felt like home and who doesn't wanna go home again?! Bon appetito! Honestly I don't know what anyone else is talking about as far as the prices being high. The prices in this place you're not high at all for the quality of the food and it is delicious believe me when I tell you I am from New York!!"}
{"text":"We went to Rudy's because we got a groupon. Initial impression...it's Italian food in a strip mall. I'm typically good with that because you find some of the best places in unexpected locations. Unfortunately this was not the case for Rudy's. Host started literally yelling for a waiter while seating us because the table for two only had one setting. We order.  Food is priced on the high side for what you're getting. Our groupon was $20 for $40 worth of food. This wouldn't even get us two entrees and two salads. I got penne alla vodka with chicken. It was fine. Not bad, not great. Similar to what you would make with a jar of sauce at home. My boyfriend got ravioli formaggio. He was served five or six large ravioli. It was fine as well. Portion way too small for the price. The entrees got us to $32.50. Waiter was nice enough to point out that we may as well get dessert to use the rest of the groupon. We got Nutella gelato ... Fantastic. Definitely bright spot in the meal. So overall it's just ok here. Definitely wouldn't go without a groupon...just too pricey for what you're getting."}
{"text":"you will not leave uphappy, service is wonderful nice small cozy italian restaurant. the food is excellent and you will go back.  if you live around the area you must must try out, new zealand cafe."}
{"text":"I have dined at Rudy's a few times and have always had a wonderful experience. Very good service and great Italian dishes. The prices are reasonable and they have a good wine selection.
Very casual and comfortable atmosphere. I have tried a variety of entrees and found all of them to be excellent.

Supported by a large local crowd."}
