{"text":"I wanted to really like this place as its right beside my house. But disappointingly the service was extremely bad to the point where I felt that they were discriminating against our table for some reason. The waiter gave us really blunt replies and basically we had to ask if our order was out yet after 20 min of waiting.  Food wise a disappointment as well. The price point was pretty high considering that all the curries didn't come with rice and the portions were small. The biggest problem was the green curry, as it had a spoiled taste to it and smelled really weird... We tried informing the waiter but was ignored.   The fried rice that we ordered was on the dry side... The pad Thai was the best out of the three but I've definitely had better around the area . Overall I will not be back."}
{"text":"The dishes we ordered tasted okay.  The green curry and pad thai are too sweet and very small portion.  I feel this place is overpriced for their dish portion.  Not worth coming."}
{"text":"Arriving at the small parking lot and seeing the tiny store, we were reluctant to believe there was such a great Thai place here.  We went in to the simple restaurant and noticed the several cultural art pieces on the wall and soft Thai music playing.   We ordered the appetizer assortment, pineapple chicken curry, steamed brown rice and pad Thai.  The appetizer assortment included a sweet and fragrant mango salad that had a bit too much dressing, the chicken skewers were moist and mild, the shrimp rolls were crispy with a nice hint of pepper, the fried taro was breaded very nicely, fresh spring rolls were very savory especially when paired with the tangy sauce, the Thai spring rolls were fresh and tangy.  Overall, the appetizer assortment is a good sampler of some great dishes with nice mixture of different flavors and textures.  The pad thai sauce was a bit too thick, but the noodles were springy and the shrimp was very fresh and overall the pad Thai was very good, altho next time we will try the pad kee mow.   The pineapple chicken curry was very aromatic. The curry was a bit strong for my wife, but paired with the rice it was perfect for me. Spicy with a nice hint of mint and pineapple sweetness. The low point was the semi-stringy chicken. With the curry in my mouth, I accidentally breathed in through my mouth and the lovely sweet aroma filled my sinuses and airways. Surely an unorthodox way of appreciating food, but very pugent and filling.      I was not a big fan of the brown rice though I was able to appreciate the nicely blended flavors. As a pairing with the curry, the flavors seem to clash slightly.   We ordered a jasmine rice, the plainess going much better with the strong curry.   The service was quick and attentive, dilligently refilling our water, with the required checking to ensure everything was to our liking.   We ordered a lot of food, so the bill was large but very reasonable. We ended up packing up quite a bit of the food.   We left very full, and very satisfied and pleased that there was such a gem hidden on main street Markham."}
{"text":"This restaurant sets the bar for Thai food in Markham.  Yes the portion sizes are not as big as others in the area but the quality of Little Bangkok surpasses them by a long shot.  My wife and I have travelled to Thailand and have experienced the best and worst Thailand had to offer (I'm dry heaving remembering the worst).  Little Bangkok has the authentic Thai taste in their dishes.  The pineapple red curry are what dreams are made of.  I'm shocked at seeing negative reviews.  This is truly a five star rating.  What's the capital of Thailand? (cover your midsection)."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  I never noticed this place before since it's tucked away in a plaza on Markham Main Street.  Thanks to Yelp, I found it when I was craving Thai and didn't want to go far from my home.  My friend and I started off with the shrimp chips that came with peanut dipping sauce.  When it arrived it was a mix of Chinese shrimp chips that I'm familiar with and another type that I can only assume are \"Thai\" shrimp chips (since I've only had these types of chips at Khao San Road). The Chinese shrimp chips are more airy than the Thai ones and didn't taste too fresh. Overall it was okay but wouldn't order this again.   My friend chose the squid salad. It was a mound of squid salad on a few leaves of lettuce - so yes, it was pretty much all squid.   The steamed squid was very tender and not at all chewy while the fish sauce based dressing was just spicy enough to give a good kick.  It was good but for me it's a dish to share because whole plate of squid is a bit too much for me.  I had the roasted duck red curry that came with pineapples, grapes (yes, grapes!), cherry tomatoes, basil and sweet peppers.  I had my reservations about the dish because I've never had grapes in a curry before but I love duck and thought I'd give it a try. The grapes were peeled and added a very slight sweetness to it.  The duck was good though tasted and looked like the Chinese roasted duck you see hanging in the window at Chinese restaurants.   The curry wasn't' overly sweet despite the pineapple & grapes. Everything worked - the curry was delicious.   Rice needs to be ordered separately, which I find odd since curry and rice go together.   We also had the Thai iced tea that was refreshing.   This is a good place to go to get a Thai food fix."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout green curry chicken and tamarind fish with coconut rice. Good portion. Great flavours. Fresh ingredients. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food in Markham. I have introduced this restaurant to a few of my friends who have enjoyed it as well. I remember coming to the restaurant a long time ago where it used to be very empty (like a hidden gem). But through the years, I have noticed more people coming here to eat. The food has stayed consistently delicious and the environment is still very intimate considering the increase in traffic. Portions for take out are quite decent as well for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I was searching for something different to go to in Markham with my husband and I'm so glad that I found the positive reviews from Lynda & Lisa on Yelp!  I highly recommend this place - LOVED their appetizer assortment (with chicken satay, shrimp rolls, spring rolls, mango salad & fried taros). We even ordered an additional chicken satay because we enjoyed it so much.  The environment was casual and the server was polite.  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in Thailand and this is as close as true Thai food comes  in Toronto.   And we have tried many.  They do not \"Canadianize\" the food.  If you want true Thai I recommend.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Perfect Thai food, very tasty and top quality. Large selection of curries. Very nice interior too. My family's favourites are: basil beef, mixed seafood basil, red and green curry, sticky rice, Thai iced tea. Have been visiting this place for three years."}
{"text":"Usually when you get thai food in the suburbs it's nothing noteworthy, but the stuff they make here is just as good as some of the places I go all the way downtown for. They manage to make Thai restaurant staples like pad Thai and cashew nut chicken elevated above the rest in flavour! Their pad thai, coconut rice, garlic shrimp, and cashew nut chicken are some of my favourites!"}
{"text":"I was there Oct 2012 based on Yelp reviews.  Overall food was just average.  I preferThai Basil over Little Bangkok."}
{"text":"Love their Bangkok Chicken with rice, the dipping sauce is spectacular. Sushi was mediocre, too much rice not enough content - just a passing grade. Being Thai myself, they are the only place that I know of where you can order coconut noodle soup and authentic papaya salad (som tum). I will try these items next time next time."}
{"text":"Admittedly, my only experience with Thai food is from a few take-out places, but this is easily one of my favourite restaurants in Markham.   My usual is the Thai-style spicy chicken or beef/fish curries with jasmine rice and mixed veg, but of the dishes I've tried all have been cooked perfectly, are nicely presented and the curries are full of all the necessary flavours. Consistency is key and that's what you'll find on repeat visits. It's more popular as a take-out restaurant I'd say, although Fridays and Saturdays can be busy. Service is friendly and non-intrusive, and the ambiance is very relaxed (cue the hammered dulcimer); decor-wise there are some cool carved wooden panels, a couple nice triptychs and other stuff to tie it together. The one downside is that it's a bit pricier than the norm, but it's well worth it. YUM.  Try: Pad Thai, Thai-style Spicy Chicken, Spicy Coconut Soup, Garlic Shrimp, any curry Avoid: Grilled Chicken - comes out a bit dry and tasteless"}
{"text":"Having a flavorful Thai set lunch!!! Delicious Thai Fish Curry - this set menu comes with Main Dish, Thai Lemon Chicken Soup and Spring Roll. Yummy! Great Deal $"}
{"text":"Little Bangkok was referred to me by a friend, and I drove by it many times but decided to take my girlfriends there for dinner.  I had seen it before when it was packed and was glad to see that when we arrived we could be seated right away. It is a fairly small restaurant and the atmosphere is nice.  The service is really good, we had two servers coming by to ask us there was anything that we wanted and through our dinner checked in on us.  The food is absolutely delicious, we had a mango salad, cashew chicken, a red curry, pad thai and the coconut rice, it came out steaming hot and the flavours were just right. The menu had quite a nice selection of different dishes so we had a hard time coming down to the choices we made. There were a few dishes that we did not get that we swear we'll order the next time we go back.  The prices are very reasonable and they also do take-out (which I will do one day) as well as can cater. This is a great restaurant in Markham that you shouldn't miss!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! One of the best thai places i have eaten at. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great tasting, authentic thai food.  Portions are a little on the small side.  The pad thai  is great and the curries are also good.  You have to order rice separately, as it doesn't come with the curry (can get a little pricey)."}
{"text":"I have been to this place quite a few times and it's been pretty consistent.  Be aware that the portions are smaller compared to other thai restaurants but I think the quality is there.  Last time we ordered:  -Pineapple curry with chicken ($11.99):  Above average curry.  Chicken was moist.  Rating: 3.5/5  -Pad see ew with beef ($12.99): Very chewy noodles.  I like the texture. Rating: 3.5/5  -Lemon soup (tom-yum) with shrimp ($6.99): Good balance of hot and sour.  Rating: 4/5  -Coconut Rice ($2.75):  If you like sweet rice I think you will love this.  This is the best coconut rice I have had.  This could actually be a dessert.  Rating: 5/5"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the markham/stouffville area ! The Thai red curry rocks , I have been here to eat and order out and both way the food has been consistently delicious"}
{"text":"They don't serve authentic Thai food. Everything is sweet, including fried fish, coconut soup, coconut rice. There were other flavours so the sweetness blended well in majority of the foods, but gradually we felt overwhelmed and wanted to eat something spicy."}
{"text":"We thought we were going to be eating authentic Thai food but boy were we wrong .  We orders coconut vegetable soup.  That was too strong.  Then we got papaya salad.  Wasn't what we expected at all. Nothing like what I had in Thailand.   Next was the mango salad.. my kids enjoyed that. Then we for pai Thai with shrimp.  Too sweet for my liking.  Not much shrimp.  We also got green curry chicken .  That was OK but I can hardly see any chicken pieces.  The fish dish we order was a big disappointment.  We at least thought it would be a whole fish.  Not 2 pieces of fillet that is battered and deep fried.  Truly disappointed.   We won't be going back here. Wasn't worth 90 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Been here twice, but both times the restaurant was dead empty.  This made be a little nervous, but thankfully it seemed like they were doing okay in the delivery department.  To make the empty atmosphere worse, the decor tries too hard for the class of restaurant that it is, but in a horrible 80's style.  They definitely need a huge makeover.  Food wise, the flavours are very strong.  I love and crave spicy food, but this was really killing it.  They use ginger in a very liberal way, and overpowers everything.  It is actually burn-your-mouth hot, followed by stinging sensation in your nose after you chewed about 3 strips of barely cooked ginger.  As for the curries, they were pretty good but I have had much better at places downtown.  I think I will save this place for only times when I don't feel like driving."}
{"text":"We tried the place right when it opened...8 some years ago and absolultely loved it. Clean, quaint, great service, excellent food. Enjoyed both dining in and takeout and this is thai food at its best."}
{"text":"I will admit I'm not the biggest Thai food fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I ordered the cashew chicken nut and my friends ordered equally yummy dishes.  Unfortunately the service really fell short. The man who worked there seemed as though it was a bother to take our order, give us water or give us the bill.   The lady was kind and more attentive. The overall tone of the service did affect the enjoyment of our meal, which is unfortunate because the food was really good. Maybe next time we'll order for take out?"}
{"text":"Been to this place many times and always enjoyed it. We always order take out and never dine in but the place is nice and clean and always great service.  We usually get the green chicken curry which is amazing on all levels. Not to spicy.  I love coming here and would come here more often"}
{"text":"This place makes a homerun! A nicely decorated place, friendly service, good menu and yummy food with a pretty plating! If I only had had more food... That is my only complaint, haha! I will definitely go back! I hope the food stays as awesome then."}
{"text":"I REALLY hate it when the menu says one thing but the restaurant serves another. So my boyfriend and I ordered \"Thai Spring Rolls\" and the menu said it has a chicken mixture in it.  When it arrived...me being really hungry just started eating it.. but my boyfriend (and I can't believe he did this) tore the whole spring roll apart cause he wasn't able to taste the chicken in the first bite.  And well...there was no chicken.  It was more like a vegetable mixture instead of a chicken mixture.  He also compared it to the $2 for 10 spring rolls at Foody Mart and said there wasn't a difference. hahaha. Well the waitress came and we told her..and she said...yea we don't use the chicken mixture anymore but we keep our menus like that.  ..Woah wait.. what? WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BLACK SHARPIE AND CROSS IT OUT THEN like how they crossed out the cheaper prices on the menu and changed it to something more expensive!!??!   Oh well... they took it off our bill and quickly cleared our plates cause we said we didn't want it anymore.  We also ordered the \"Dried Red Curry with Shrimp\"..and  some other kind of Red Curry with chicken and peanuts.  Okay I'll admit...their curry is AMAZING :D!! The portion was smallish...you also have to pay an extra $2.50 for rice..which is necessary.   If I ever go back....which I don't think I will, I would just get an order of their curry :)"}
{"text":"Very unfriendly service. Was overcharged. Food NOT that great.   Disapppointed."}
{"text":"As soon as we parked our car in front of the restaurant, we could smell the aroma of goodness!  Since it was our first visit, I wasted no time letting staff know that I'm Thai.  Within a few minutes, a lovely Thai lady in the kitchen came out to greet us.  Ah ... it felt almost like home!  I was very impressed with everything we ordered.  Delicious, authentic flavors and right portion size, this place reminded me of a mom and pop place in Thailand.  The Tamarind Fish Delight - Pla-Jian.  Perfectly fried fish with rich and flavorful tamarind sauce was a hit at our table.  Roasted Duck Red Curry - Gang-Ped-Pad-Yang was absolutely divine!  Tender and buttery duck in spicy and creamy with hints of lemongrass, ginger and kaffir leaf.  A must try dish!  Since our parents prefer milder dishes, we also ordered stir fried vegetables and fried rice.  They were all terrific and well prepared.  And to finish off, a large order of deep fried bananas.  Our parents enjoyed the restaurant so much that we have since returned several times.  We are happy to report that the service and quality of food have been consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Went with a group while in Ontario for a work thing and everyone in the party agreed that it was the best Thai we'd had in Markham yet. Definitely ask for coconut rice if you get a rice dish. Also of note: the service was actually prompt - like American prompt without the snark. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located directly across Markham Go Station, I used to come here with my family sometimes for Thai dinners.  My go-to was the red curry roast duck.    Came here a few weeks ago after a hiatus for a few years, and it seems things have gone a little downhill.    A friend of mine arrived to our reservation before me, and said that the front of house gentleman (I suspect he is at least part owner if not full) was curt at best.  However, our server (a young lady) was sweet and friendly.   The duck curry seems to lack the coconut cream it used to hold, and the hubs suspected that the roast duck is purchased from a random Chinese BBQ'd meats place (you know, the kind with crispy roast ducks or char-siu/reddish BBQ pork hanging by hooks in the windows?).   The curries don't taste like they've been simmered with all the ingredients, and taste rather like separate components that have just been thrown into a pre-made curry at the last minute.   Rice is sold separately from the entrées.  If you order two orders of rice, they will come served in the same bowl.    The location is truly convenient, but it's not a place that comes to mind for me when in search of a satisfying Thai meal."}
{"text":"Very Delicious food, however, we were upset with the quantity - take out curry fits one cup soup bowl - which is very little for something that cost around $12. Also, barely had any chicken breast...but again the curry was delicious :)"}
{"text":"It is hidden in a plaza, opposite to Main St GO Station, where you would not expect a restaurant such as this. It is not a 5-star of course, probably a family managed restaurant but I like those family managed ones. I feel there is more passion.  Food: Great. Not the best Thai I had but better than most. Quantity is a little low but love the quality of food. All the flavors are very good. Feels real Thai for sure. It can be a little pricey so keep a tab on what you are ordering. Last time I was there, I ended up spending $60 on an appetizer, one main course and one desert with Coca-Cola. I loved their salads!!! Most def give it a try.  Service: OK. Nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Thai food and so I decided to give it a try with my friends since it was nearby. First off - the service is horrible. There was a waiter that just stood there and stared at us when we entered and he didn't even bother saying hi or anything, neither did he give us a seat, so eventually we had to seat ourselves. It took about 10 minutes before we got the waiter's attention to take our order. Quite unacceptable especially since the restaurant was empty (there were only two tables including ours at that time). Second of all - I ordered chicken pad thai and it was pretty disgusting. I don't usually complain too much about thai food, but to me this just tasted like noodles with ketchup. We ordered the pineapple fried rice as well and it was pretty average/nothing special - I've had better fried rice than this before. My friend ordered green curry and this was the best dish out of all of ours. I kind of regret not getting this instead. (thats why I'm giving it a 2 star instead of a 1 because I actually like the green curry) Over all, I would much rather get thai express at a food court than come here for the food. Would I come here again? most likely not."}
{"text":"I really like this place - my goto Makham spot for Thai food. Love the Basil chicken. Tried most dishes on the menu and most are good. Dishes marked as spicy don't seam that spicy to me. Friendly staff. Never ate in the restaurant  (always do take out) so can't speak to the quality of service."}
{"text":"A-OK Thai food with good service in a great, clean atmosphere.  Very polite waitress, good flavourful food. Clean dishes with nice little flares (ex: carrot flowers). Would give it four stars if it had a bigger portion size. I only got 5 shrimp in my red curry dish. Good service.   Thai iced coffee was good! Not too sweet but great!  Way better Than the Thai iced tea I've tried at other places.  Would come here again based on this experience."}
{"text":"After almost three weeks of meats and taters, I came back to TO craving coconut rice. Then my friend's coworker recommended this place and a day later, there we were.   At first glance the restaurant sign is simple. Had we not been searching for it, I would have missed it. Heck, I did miss it until my friend (who had street viewed the place prior) pointed it out to me. The exterior is nothing fancy, but the interior is nice: warm atmosphere, nice blue table cloths, soft background music - great for a girls night, I'd hold off on bringing any young families though.   Several people came in and out before we ordered to pick up take out. The place seemed popular enough. The service was prompt and the food came out quickly. I ordered the roasted duck curry and a coconut rice and my friend ordered the tamarind beef curry with a coconut rice instead.   Why this place lost a couple of stars: we ordered two coconut rices, only one bowl came. Although it was larger, there was an assumption we would want to share. We did not. The coconut rice was also not creamy. Unlike my favourite Thai place in Hamilton, the sweet coconut milk taste was lacking. My duck curry also had lots of skin, fat and bones in it. I ended up wasting a lot of an already small dish. My friend enjoyed her tamarind beef, her only complaint was that they charge an extra dollar for all beef dishes, even if beef comes standard with the order. This seems to be an add on as a label was printed and taped to the cover of the menu.   Overall, the food was not bad, it just was not great. I haven't found a Thai place in Markham, like the hole in the wall in Hamilton, but until then, this will do."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai place in Markham. Don't let its location in the least Asian part of Markham fool you -- this is a true Mom and Pop restaurant. This is also arguably the best restaurant on Main Street Markham --- people always complain that there aren't enough good restaurants but forget about this place as it's at the far north end of the commercial part of Main Street.  Their fried rice is amazing and all of the dishes we've ordered over the years have been good."}
{"text":"Overall, it was decent experience with decent food. We got the appetizers for 2 which comes with a variety of different things. I personally enjoyed the fried taro. The satay chicken though, I definitely wasn't a big fan of as it didn't taste like satay at all. We then got the curry beef with coconut milk which was in my opinion was alright but a bit more on the oily side and got a side of coconut rice (the dish didn't come with rice). Then for dessert we had the mango with sticky rice. It was pretty generic but the mangoes weren't sweet enough."}
{"text":"Wow, I was reading other yelp reviews and thought this place would be decent.  I was surprised to say that this place was not to my taste.   We ordered the following: Tom Yum Goon soup - very salty and bland Coconut Chicken soup - chicken was tasteless and the soup base was too sweet Chicken skewers - tasted fake Pad Thai noodles - very saucy and tasteless Lemon salmon - sour sour sour  Probably won't recommend this place to my friends.   The highlight of the meal was probably the  Singha Beer (Thai)  Service was friendly (that's where the 1 star came from)"}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad during the weekdays. The waiter seems to be very inpatient. Don't ask for spicy because they would make it insanely spicy. Portion is tiny. A bowl of rice will cost you $2.   Not recommended. Too bad there isn't any other Thai place around this area. Maybe that's why they can still survive."}
{"text":"The ambience is great !  Service was tentative, we ordered the red curry chicken - very good / Thai style Pad Thai - noodles are chewy / dessert - mango salad was okay - I think the sticky rice was under cook."}
{"text":"I'm editing my review based on my last visit to the restaurant.  This time I tried the green chicken curry which was delicious with nice veggies and chicken mixed in.  The only thing I found perplexing is that they didn't include a bowl of rice.  That really was a bit disappointing considering but it's definitely worth trying as it is just the right amount of spicy and not overpowering.  When I paired it with the coconut rice it was mouth watering delicious."}
{"text":"I am basing this review off the dishes that I have tried  -Red/Green/Yellow Curry Chicken  -Coconut Rice (a gift from god) -Chicken Skewers -Garlic Shrimp -Shrimp Crackers -Pad Thai  My favorite Thai curry place hands down.  A must try if you like Thai Curry. And get the coconut rice!"}
{"text":"These days with all the fusion cooking out there, it's hard to find good quality authentic international cuisine, and thai food is one of hardest in Toronto.   Little Bangkok is a little gem in the heart of downtown Markham. It's quite small and hidden, blink and you may drive pass it.  Upon entering the restaurant, you feel like you're in some fancy restaurant. Nicely lined tables, cloth napkins and wine glasses as water cups, it's beautifully decorated on the inside.    I have come here for both lunch and dinner, though I've always ordered on the dinner menu (the food is to good to get half the portions).  Standard fare: Pad thai, amazing. Not too dry, but not too saucy, it's perfectly cooked and with the right amount of flavour.    The pineapple fried rice is also something to be admired.  Fresh chunks of pineapple with cashews in a rice blend.. mmmmmmm.. They have many different types of curry, and to be honest, I don't really know the difference. I think the color indicates level of spiciness, but I could be wrong. If you're going to order the curry, you must get the coconut rice! By far the best coconut rice I have ever tasted! I could eat the rice plain on its own if I wanted!   The Tom Yum soup is also a must order, the sweet and sour combination is delightful. If you are interested in trying real authentic thai food, go to Little Bangkok, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai spicy noodle and it was terrible. I've ordered it many times from other Thai restaurants and I love be it. This place had the plain noodles in a separate container than the sauce and veggies. Noodles were stuck together and couldn't be pulled apart. The sauce was watery and gross. Normally this is one dish not 2 separate dishes."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful gem in my neighbourhood. The food is very good, the takeout is fast and the service is friendly. I don't ever dine in the restaurant because I live nearby, so it's not so much a destination place for me, but a good takeout option. Any time I go in to pick up my food, I always take notice of how nicely the dishes are plated for diners. My favourite is the dry red curry. I also really like the cashew chicken and the Thai spring rolls. My husband and son always order the shrimp pad thai.  My one complaint is that it closes at 9 on weekdays. If it were open later, I would probably order more often (I'm a late dinner eater)."}
{"text":"OMG!  Horrible tasting, probably stale food that you can't digest!   They definitely don't know how to make Thai food!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to count the number of times i've passed by this place, but never stopped in. That changed last week! My hubby stopped in and picked up some take out for us. Here are the things that stood out:  Pad thai - their tamarind sauce is so flavourful! Loved it and it had just the right amount of tofu, chicken, shrimp & bean sprouts. Generous portion for only $10.99!  Cashew Nut Chicken - good amount of heat vs sweet, ample chicken, veggies etc.  Coconut rice - Soooo good - nothing else to add!  Appetizer sampler - loved the fried tofu, chicken, satay, shrimp & spring rolls and cold rolls.  I have already been back for a second round in less than a week. Stopped in for some of their yummy pad thai.  Friendly staff, clean restaurant & lots of seating. Great lunch specials  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Markham by far! Their curries are wonderful, and their mango salad is to die for. They do take-out, but it's also a pretty quiet and cozy place to have a sit-in meal"}
{"text":"Looked so promising when we entered: a spacious dining room furnished with beautiful Thai sculptures, wood carvings and wall art. They even had a typical shrine along with portraits of the royal family, could this be a truly authentic Thai restaurant?  Sweet hostess greeted and seated us. Ordered off the$8.99 lunch menu which includes an eggroll and soup. I had the Pad Thai with the lemongrass (Tom Yum) soup. The Pad Thai was too sweet and the soup was way too strong (overkill in the flavor department), the eggroll was tasty and crispy. Hubby had the Pad See Ew and added beef, he chose the coconut soup as the accompaniment; the beef was over tenderized but I liked the flavor of the noodles. The coconut soup was too heavy on the coconut flavor.   Thai food is really tricky to cook, there are many different ingredients that go into a dish that can't be substituted. We've had really good authentic Thai food from hole in the wall restaurants with real Thai cooks from Thailand, so it's really hard for us to find a place that knows how to balance all the complex flavors together. Our search for really good, authentic Thai food continues....."}
{"text":"Little bangkok was not as not as good as I expected them to be. After reading some good reviews here on Yelp - I  had a ton of expectations. However, i was a bit disappointed.   On the plus side, we were went in for Saturday night dinner without reservations and got seated right away.  However, food was not up to the mark. I was there with couple of friends and below is what we had  - Curry puffs (Vegetarian puffs with potatoes, tasted slightly sweet than spicy/hot) - Green curry with vegetables - Green curry with fish - Green curry with chicken  We all ordered green curry as our waitor told us that was spicier. However, upon tasting it - it did not really live up. We had order rice separately as it did not come with the curries. I found this to be a bit strange as almost all Thai restaurants offer this as a part of their entree. Portions were right size and price was fine. Overall, it was okay for a meal but I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for years with family and friends. The food and service is always enjoyable. Prices are reasonable. This past Saturday evening was no exception.  Their mango salad is superb. Don't think we have ever had a dish that wasn't tasty.    Bill came to around $50 for two people with tax and tip included. Only one glass of wine and no dessert.  Best Thai restaurant we know of in the Markham Unionville area."}
{"text":"#1 menu item is the coconut soup! You don't typically see this on the menu of many Thai restaurants so it was a real surprise in my mouth. I could taste lemongrass, ginger, lime, coconut and so many more I can't point out. Flavor combinations were on point!! For your main, curries are the next best thing but they don't come with rice so you need to order on the side."}
{"text":"I debated between a 3 and 4 and I'm going to stick with giving this a 4.0 (really a 3.5 rounded up).  Loved the authenticity to this place. Lots of Thai accents, and traditional Thai accents and menu selection.   All of the notes on location are true. It's in a strip mall style plaza next to a GO Station parking lot. It has a lot of traffic during the evening and a decent value selection for the lunch menu. There are two lunch menus, one for $8.99 and one for $9.99. I attached a photo of that menu.  I ended up having the Basil Beef and Lemon Chicken Soup. I didn't want to, I wanted the Pad Thai, but the thing is, if you didn't have $10 before taxes, you had to pay cash. I get that things are pricey for card transactions but come on...  Anyways, in terms of food quality I thought the lemon soup was a tad too citrusy and sour, but it was delicious none the less.  The basil beef was great, good amount of meat, hot, fresh, and enough rice and veggies to make a good lunch.  While i'd agree to portions being small, I'd say that they're perfect for a quick lunch or business lunch. I don't expect to get stuffed but this will satisfy a craving and be something that won't keep you bloated. Happy to come back to try a few more things."}
{"text":"This review is based on a lunch experience.  I came for lunch specials ($8) with coworkers.  The food was authentic Thai.  The lemon chicken soup and the pad see ew were delicious with intensed flavours.  The spring roll and the pad thai tasted average.  What was disappointing was the portion.  It was so small that we, three Chinese girls, devoured the food on plate and still needed a cookie or energy bar afterwards to feel full.  A Canadian male coworker went to Subway to get a 12-inch sub sandwich right after.    It is one thing for the portion to be small, but it is another when none of us is full.  The value of the meal was below disappointing.  I conclude that this lunch experience is delicious but unfulfilling.  I will not return for lunch.  I hope the dinner portion is better, or I will not have an authentic Thai restaurant to dine at in Markham.  Overall, 1.5 star.  (Nope, I can't up that to 2 stars.  Just can't)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice and it deserves 4 stars but the service was the reason I can't give it four stars.   Me and my friends went to this restaurant because we found it on yelp and we liked it. We first order the mango salad and the portion size was big which can be easily be shared with 2 people. For main course, we ordered the green curry and red curry along with chicken noodle soup. The portion size for the soup was big tho but I was surprise they charge extra for rice. I mean, you are charging $11 for the curry and you want me to add $1.50 for a bowl of jasmine rice? I felt that was unreasonable.  Decor was really nice, it really makes me feel like it was really eating at a real Thai restaurant. But it was the service that really drove me crazy. We were served by two waiters, one male and one female but they were never in the dining area together. The female waiter was really nice and helpful. The male server is the one that drove me crazy, when we were ready to order, we tried to flag him down but he had problems notice us and he frequently quickly slipped back to the kitchen. Next, he comes around refilling everyone's water glasses. When he got to our table, he refill 2 out of 4 of our glasses and left because he ran out of water. We expected him to come back to finish filling our glasses but nope, he again slipped back in the kitchen and never showed up again. Thankfully, around 10 minutes later, the female waiter and finished filling our glasses.  Would I come back? Maybe, just maybe..."}
{"text":"Strong flavours and its the sauce which makes the food taste good.  Started off with a green mango salad $7.99 - had a sweet and sour flavour in the dressing and it went well with the thin crispy wafer which had a hint of sweetness. Decent size and good to share between two people.  Couldn't stop myself from ordering chicken satay when its found on the menu. For $8.99 you get 4 thin sliced chunks of chicken. Nicely grilled on the outside and the peanut sauce is to die for. Underneath the chicken was a small bed of salad. The dressing for the salad was sweet and sour once again but also had some chili flakes to give it some heat.  I found this dish to be a decent size which was good to share between two people as well.   Yellow curry with beef lunch special $7.99 which comes with a bowl of rice, a single spring roll and a bowl of lemon chicken soup or coconut chicken soup. The spring roll was nice and crispy and of course it came with a dipping sauce which was once again sweet and sour. I went with the coconut flavour soup and it definately had a strong coconut taste. It tasted weird at first but it slowly grew on me. The soup also had some sliced mushrooms and small chunks of chicken.   The actual yellow curry with beef was pretty good too with flavours which range from sweet, a slight spicy and a coconut milk taste to it. Along with the yellow curry was potatoes and onions and a decent portion of thinly sliced beef. I found the yellow curry sauce to be overly sweet or it may have been the combination of all the food I ate which had a sweet flavour to it. They must have drenched honey over almost everything.   Also had the tamarind beef curry lunch special $7.99 which is pretty much the same as the yellow curry with beef.   Service was good. The place looked clean and nicely decorated. Lots of parking for a restaurant found on Markham Main Street. The price is decent but when you start adding up all the small dishes that I want to try it could get expensive. I had to hold back and stop myself from ordering the pastry puff which was advertised on a little sign on the table and also the dessert of the day (mango pudding with sticky rice) which was advertised right when you enter. The guy next to me ordered a Thai ice coffee which looked amazing and I had to stop myself from ordering that too. If I actually ordered all the things I wanted I'm sure I would have spend $40 on just myself."}
{"text":"Panang beef curry, shrimp green curry and the coconut rice were all delicious. The spice level was just right (which probably means a bit westernized). Coconut rice was fragrant and amazing, but 2.75 for a small bowl =(, I could eat like 5 of those to soak up all that curry goodness.  Only other (minor) complaint is that the curries are a tad sweet, but nothing like Salad King sweet. Again, maybe a bit restrained to not blow off our Western taste buds?"}
{"text":"I ended up at Little Bangkok based on review posted here and the need to find a Thai place that could satisfy a group of 8, without being too expensive.  Upon entering the decor at the restaurant was inviting, with art  and vintage photos from Thailand.   Friendly, not rushed and consistently good service was a prelude to the real reason everyone should go here: delicious and non pretentious Thai food.  Our group had : satay chicken, mango salad, spring rolls for starters.  Pad Thai, sticky rice, mixed vegetables, garlic shrimp, tamarind chicken and yellow curry for mains.  All the dishes were delicious and tasted just right, not too spicy or sweet. I specially want to mention the mixed vegetables, as i usually end up not touching the vegetables in most thai places, but the dish was cleaned out at our table almost immediately.  I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"This cute little Thai restaurant is situated in Markham and seems like a family run business.  There is always a male and female server who manages all the tables but they are efficient.    Our favourite dishes are the pad thai, the coconut rice, and their cashew chicken.  They do make a delicious fried fish with tamarind sauce but I find that their fish needs to be more crispy.    They also do sell tom yum soups and tom kha gais but they are quite price at $6/bowl.  I wouldn't mind paying for a bowl of soup that I can't make at home for less money (ie: tom yum soup).  But something like tom kha gai should be less than $6/bowl...   Overall, we are frequent visitors so we'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ate in last night with my parents. 3.5/5, +.5 for service.  Highlights included the fresh spring rolls, chicken satay, roasted duck red curry, thai curry puffs, and fried ice cream. I particularly enjoyed the satay and sweet sauces this restaurant had, and I even liked the red curry (and I'm a person who has a low spice tolerance).  I also had the golden squid which was okay, but not too memorable. It was pretty much squid rings in deep fried batter; something many other restaurants have already.  Service, once again, was excellent. The waiter explained every single question we had, and kindly offered us alternatives for dessert since we arrived quite late, and many options were already out for the night.  Surprisingly we never touched any rice or noodle dishes this time around. Perhaps next time?"}
{"text":"The food is too sweet ! They use way too much sugar.  Not enough balance of spice and sour and sweetness.  Not enough meats in the beef and chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Good service for a small restaurant, tuck in a small complex. for starter, I was leery going in, because there were no one inside. but why not, give it a try. Som Tum (papaya salad) not bad. it need more vinegar & splash of fish sauce + dry shrimp and then make it spicy. its not bad, but need more spice. then I order the Panang Nuer (Beef Curry), I asked them to make it spicy, but apparently that failed. the curry was nice, but I like it spicy. almost as good as you can get for the panang nuer. my friend ordered Tom Yum (skip it, don't look like tom yum to me) I don't know how it taste but don't look like one. then he ordered green curry and Vegetarian fried rice (that the first mistake, vegy for thai.. ) I tried the curry, hm.. you can skip that too. and I didn't try the fried rice.  so, why I'm giving 4 stars, because the food I ordered hit the spot, they are not bad. but the problem is, if you go there, just have the two items that I had, then you should be good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I ordered pad thai twice and fried rice with crab once.  Both times when I ordered the pad thai, I didn't feel the best afterwards. I think part of the reason was because it was very creamy. The flavour was delicious and the portion was quite generous.  The most recent time I came here, I got the fried rice with crab and it was about $11. I should've known better and expected imitation crab. The dish itself was good but it definitely was not worth the price. The portion was large enough to be filling.  Overall, I find this restaurant to be a bit on the pricey side for okay food."}
{"text":"We returned to Little Bangkok for dinner and were pleased to find the service had improved noticeably. Service was the only weak point in this restaurant's overall excellent rating. Now that too is very good."}
{"text":"WORST Thai food! We were there a couple of years ago and remember liking it. Not sure if they've changed owners. Did delivery with 2 friends last night. Ordered 5 dishes. WE COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE between the soup and the curry! Honestly the green curry was soup. There was barely any chicken in either curry and the spicy beef had about 4 pieces of beef. We were so disappointed - definitely didn't keep the leftovers and contemplated ordering in a pizza! TERRIBLE Thai."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, a solid 3.5 stars with a good round up! I have visited this plaza countless times and have never had the chance to stop at this restaurant. How glad that I did! We ordered the appetizer platter, the tamarind curry, and pad thai. We definitely should have ordered the Thai style pad thai because the western style was too sweet. That was on us though, because the waitress asked before we ordered. So my advice is order the Thai style pad thai!!! All the food was very good and flavourful.   I did take one star off though because it is on the expensive side. You are looking at around $15 per person if you order one entree for each person. Overall though, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I thought it was authentic Thai food but it turned out not as good as I expected.. kinda disappointed.."}
{"text":"I have always loved this little restaurant.  Tucked away in a plaza it doesn't scream \"COME AND GET IT\", but it certainly does offer some delicious Thai foods.  We came here with my family and we ordered the appertizer platter to share (salad, fried taro sticks, shrimp roll, spring rolls, fresh rolls).  Definitely good option to share!  Then we shared the chicken pad thai, the basil eggplant stir fry and the spicy tofu.  We cleared all the plates and enjoyed the different flavors each dish offers."}
{"text":"Little Bangkok was something I just had to try because I had to see whether if this would be my new main Thai restaurant.  It was tucked into a plaza across from the Main St. Go Station and easily missed.    I went in as a group of 4 and there was nobody else in the restaurant at 1PM on a Friday.   The lunch menu had all the popular dishes for a discounted price as a smaller version and came with soup and a spring roll. (including the curries and pad thai)  The lemon chicken soup that came as an appetizer was very condensed and overpowering. The spring rolls were crunchy and each came with their little own dipping sauce.    I ordered a chicken noodle soup that came out somewhat disappointing as it was bland but did have many pieces of chicken. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried rice and it was amazing.  They had large pieces of chicken in there and was very tasty.  My sister's boyfriend loved his pineapple curry but had to pay for rice on the side (as it wasn't part of the lunch menu).  He said it was sweet from the curry & went really well with the rice. My sister got a curry from the lunch menu (no idea what she ordered) but it was spicy and creamy at the same time.    I'm definitely getting the fried rice or her curry.  The 2 issues I had with the restaurant was  1. Even though it was a lunch menu set - the portions of the main dishes were really, extremely small.   2. The server was always missing and he had a really bad attitude.  It was like: Okay, what do you want? & when you were trying to tell him the number of the dish he would look at you like \"wtf?\" and would not acknowledge that you said anything.  No smiles. No greeting. Or as my friend put it \"I'm trying to figure out why the server's so pissed off at us.\"  I will return to try their mango sticky rice and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Little Bangkok was a pleasant find as I found Thai resturants hard to come by in Markham. We ordered take-out so can't comment on the wait staff but when we picked up our food, the restaurant seemed quite nice and busy - which is a good sign on a Friday.  On to the food, we ordered:  Assorted appetizer platter - This was a great sampler of the various snacks they had on the menu. For 2 people, this was a large sized appetizer - everything was crispy and tasty. Highly recommend!  Green chicken curry (with coconut milk) - I found the flavour to be amazing. It was very rich and flavourful. My wife found the curry a bit too creamy (maybe from the coconut milk) but I thought this was an ideal green curry. Not too spicy and full of flavour. Highly recommend as well!  Pad Thai - Great taste in the noodles with right balance of heat and sweetness. I would also order again.  I was a bit wary as some previous Yelpers mentioned that the portions were small. But for a couple, 2 mains + app platter was alot of food. We had leftovers for lunch next day! So, for me, if I was looking for Thai food in Markham, Little Bangkok is a great place. We'll probably be a bit more adventuresome and order the non-standard stuff so I will certainly return."}
{"text":"This one I decided to try after seeing some good Yelp review. Turns out pretty good, I had the red duck curry (mild) with coconut rice and a pad Thai. Both came very good presented. The curry is very tasty and the duck is just perfect. The pad Thai maybe a bit sweet but still an awesome dish. Some of the down side is the cost (This meal cost me $30 with tips and tax for 2). Also the portion is not big at all. If you are a big eater, consider getting another rice ($2) or eat something else before coming......"}
{"text":"It's tough to find an real Thai restaurant in Markham/Richmond Hill/ Scarborough area that's not also a Vietnamese restaurant that offers Thai food. Little Bangkok is a hidden gem tucked away in touristy Main Street Markham that will pleasantly surprise you.   Their menu is quite extensive considering majority of (authentic) Thai places (like Khao San Road and Sokhu Thai) only have a one-pager while Little Bangkok offers you a whole book to look at.   Thai Iced-Tea is a definite must try for those who has never had one before.  $5 for a starter sized tom yum soup is a rip off but it's big enough to share between 2 people.   Shrimp crackers w/peanut sauce is a great appetizer to share if you still want room in your stomach for a full meal.  Pineapple red shrimp curry only comes with pineapple and shrimp. If you want some vegetables like mushroom, baby corn, and peppers in your curry, don't make the same mistake as me and get a regular curry. ps. they offer coconut rice :D"}
{"text":"\"Our restaurant never makes Papaya Salad (Som Tum) Spicy!\"  All I asked was to ask the kitchen to throw in a few Thai Chili pepper?!  My Grilled Chicken with Sticky Rice ($8.95) was disappointing. The chicken tasted like it underwent some mutation... or rehydrated chicken??   Meh..."}
{"text":"2. 5 stars. My review is based on lunch experience on a weekday. Service was friendly and polite. I ordered something from the lunch special menu; basil chicken fried rice which came with a spring roll and a soup (lemon chicken soup or coconut chicken soup). You can add a side of mango salad to lunch special for $1.5.  Food was very OK; portions were very small. Side of mango salad is very very small; I guess it's alright as its only $1.5. Both mango salad and soup were too salty for my liking. Chicken fried rice was just ok; this was the smallest fried rice I ever got; not sure if this is small because it's lunch special or its their regular size. Fried rice was loaded with onions and more onion, mixed with bok choy, diced carrot, corn and peas, little thin pieces of chicken.  Overall, food was just okay, portion was small. Service was polite and nice quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"This is the type of food I expect when I think of thai .We had a party of four and we ordered mango salad , pad Thai , squid salad, green curry and duck red curry  . The  food was authentic though the portions were small ( more Like a tapas portion ).  I'm not a big eater but the portions were Relatively smaller than other Thai restaurants . I enjoyed every thing that we've ordered , especially  the mango sticky rice dessert and the squid salad . This place is def a hidden gem"}
{"text":"omg the quietest restaurant in the whole wide world. Of my two visits, me and company have been their only customer.  I have always had Pad Thai at fast food Thai restaurants, soooo this one I ate here was REALLY good. Not spicy!  I also had Siamese Beef and Grilled Chicken, both were yummy too, and ordinary. I remember having shrimps here, but I forgot which dish... that was pretty okay, also ordinary.  I like the Thai iced tea, it was goood :)   The place was decorated so adorably, with long white table clothes and a candle/flower centre piece. So romantic, awwww. Service was great! Because it was so quiet, they only did an occasional check up (which I'm so tremendously glad). They didn't stand behind the counter and stared at us, yay yay yay yay. Both lunch went well."}
{"text":"OH-MY-GOD  The worst Thai food I have had in long long time and I thought Arizona's Thai food was bad.  If you want Thai food, Little Bangkok is not the place to go.  However, Thai students from University of Toronto has recommended Thai Noodle [http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-noodle-toronto] but I didn't get a chance to try.  1-star:  not at all authentic, surprisingly pricey, and the food was straight out not edible."}
