{"text":"What a treat.....This pub was amazing. From the eggs benedict to the best burgers in town to the fish tacos ending the day with nachos and smores out on their patio around the fire pit! Great atmosphere!!!!! Can't wait to return New Years weekend."}
{"text":"ITS OKAY!  A nice pub serving British dishes. I've been there a couple times. Fish and chips are a great choice. Bangers and mash, sausage was flavorless and mushy and peculiar. Corned beef sliders are a good choice. Shepard's pie was great one time I had it, not so good other times. Inconsistencies exist here. As far as service goes, if you get the younger guy serving you, he doesn't get your order right and you will wait for your drinks.  ASK HIM TO WRITE DOWN YOUR ORDER, it's your experience, not his. He talks too much and forgets he is there to serve you and he may think your there to see him.  With the coupons they consistently send out, I will come back for the fish and chips.  I just need to know what days that server is off."}
{"text":"Come here regularly for trivia and music bingo. The food is great and they have a large beer selection.  ANDRE is an amazing and knowledgeable server."}
{"text":"Our first visit here. Hubs had shepherds pie and I their fish & chips. My husband thought  his dinner was pretty good, & I thought mine was good, too. The homemade coleslaw that came with my dish was very good! 
Will come here again - good atmosphere and good food...and drink!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going here to watch the Soccer game the whole bar has already been reserved we all left...very disappointed..."}
{"text":"Burger heaven! Service is awesome when Megan is here...food is great..Megan was friendly, attentive and knows her beers...doesn't hurt that she is pleasant on the eyes as well...definitely have to try the burgers! CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Kerri and Tiffini are fantastic!! Just go here, eat the fish and chips and drink Guinness. It will just make you happy!!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson and searched for a local British Pub as soon as I could.. When I saw this one offered trivia and was called Shakespeare's  I was double excited. I had so high hopes...which were quickly squashed.. Where to begin... The service was terrible , I mean piss poor attitudes, pretentious snobbery , just plain rude.. How to servers, bartenders, and hostesses of a pub come to have such high regard for themselves and such low regard for their customers .One of the things a pub is known for is their love for their customers, that warm and fuzzy feeling that everyone knows your name..or at least wants to learn it. sigh, maybe i watch too much CHEERS 

So where was I, our waiter was an ass. Our food was disgusting.. meat skewers that looked like mini meat skewers..So tiny and dried up ..They were completely inedible..I would have told our server to take them back, if he had ever came back to out table.. I was pretty sad and wanted to leave but then trivia began , it was hosted by some woman who just downloaded everything from a site and sat at a booth and ate while sloooowly going through the questions and answers..giving all the tables plenty of time to get the answers off their phones. She was too busy eating and flirting with all the managers to even check for cheaters.  
Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.  A friend recommended this place. They went because of a coupon, loved the fish and chips.  We waited and couldn't find a coupon but had to go anyway and they were so right.  Not only was the fish and chips great, It was huge.  The Ruben sandwich was the best I've had    Wow.  You gotta go."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service is incredible. Jorge the server is upbeat fun and keeps the drinks coming! He is by far the best waiter we have ever had."}
{"text":"Very good beer selection, dart board, pool table, friendly staff, quiet ambience (no loud music).
Potato wedges with curry are adictive.  
Steak and mushroom pie is very good. 
Shepperds pie is good. 
Chicken curry and veggies is OK,"}
{"text":"I want this to be a completely fair review. I write reviews for several websites as a destination expert and rarely reveal that fact. I have never written a Yelp review but this will be my first.  Our demographic is that we are local, retired, professionals probably not the crowd usually served by Shakespeare's. Today we decided to try lunch at Shakespeare's Grille and Pub. I few months ago we tried dinner and found a delightful array of beers, a casual atmosphere, and knowledge staff. We felt very welcomed as we experienced the menu and sampled a couple of the beers recommended. The waiter was a fountain of information about various brews both seasonal and standard. He had a wealth of knowledge regarding imports as well. 

That evening we tried several offerings but the stand out was the crispy golden fish and chips. The fish was perfectly fried with a nice batter coating that was neither too thick or two thin. The chips were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The cole slaw was a very nice portion and had a nice dressing that was tangy, sweet, and not overly sauced with mayonnaise. 

Today we visited for lunch and the experience was horrid. When we pulled up we noticed a unkempt looking smallish fellow sleeping in the patio area. We were running a few errands and had our little dog with us when we decided to stop for a quick lunch. We are very skilled in fostering animals and treat our own as a much loved member of the family. We often travel with our little dog and he is ever so spoiled. We expected to be in the business no more than 30 minutes. We intermittently run the air conditioner for the dog and have remote access to do so and we take turns checking on him every 10 minutes for the short time we are in dispose. This seemed reasonable on a day with the temperature being 67 degrees and his kennel was in the shade. After the first 10 minutes I went outside to start the air conditioning.  I was met by a lady who seemed genuinely concerned that there was a dog inside the car and unattended. I do understand that people can make judgments out of concern which may not be compatible with facts. I explained that he is very much attended and thanked her for her concern.  At that point the young man began spewing angry, and ill informed opinions about how we cared for our much loved companion. An animal companion who has traveled the nation in this same car with adoring care from his owners. The young man continued to escalate and nothing could convince him that he was incorrect in his judgment. At that point it was clearly an excuse to be angry, venomous, insulting, and abusive with no real concern for the animal. He might have originally been well meaning but he became bizarre.  There are not enough lines to express how vulgar, ignorant, and abusive his affect and language became. This included repeating that he hoped the dog died. Strange words for someone supposedly concerned for animal welfare.

It turns out that this young man entered Shakespeare's when he cooled slightly. His affect was completely different and it was Jekyll to Hyde scary. He was confronted about his behavior and he casually denied any responsibility and that was the end of that. I was so concerned for the safety of our dog and our car that I couldn't return to the dining area at all. I sat in the car and my husband as my surrogate discussed the situation with the waitress. She stated that the fellow was one of there \"best players\". I  don't know if that is pool, trivia, bar top poker, or something else but he was clearly representing an important asset to the bar. 

I did have my meal to go and again the fish and chips are noteworthy. The food here is good. I wish I could honestly offer a four start review. I can not.. There are many nicer places to go where you can feel safe. I do hope this experience is not representative of their core base of customers. Beware if you venture into this type of situation that it is very unpleasant to be unprotected by an establishment from this sort of erratic behavior. They may have indeed acted if it had occurred inside their space  where it was witnessed instead of on the patio.

It is for the sake of future diners that we will call the owner to discuss the experience. I doubt that we will ever return. This was  twilight zone dining."}
{"text":"I have been the past two Wednesdays with friends for their pub quiz. The service is very good. The few servers are overwhelmed a bit with the crowds for trivia, but they make the extra effort to get things taken care of. The trivia is a fair challenge, the questions are generally a bit dated, but there is a ok mix of topics. The 3 stars comes from the food and drink prices. Domestic drafts were $4 and most meals were over $12 and not more than basic bar food. Otherwise, this is a fun spot for Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Excellent, we strolled in for Brunch/Breakfast and Sunday Funday Football. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. They cleaned the table for us immediately, before we sat down. The items we ordered were cooked to perfection. The TV's weren't too loud, but loud enough to enjoy the games... I LOVE THIS PLACE=GREAT ATMOSPHERE AND GREAT FOOD!  It was our first time going for breakfast and we will definitely be back.....THANKS!"}
{"text":"Jaime was great.  She was patient with us, being first time customers.  Love the beer selection.  Ordered mac and cheese and fish and chips on her recommendation.  The mac and cheese was awesome. The fish and chips needed some salt and was good.  Also had a Reuben sandwich, which was great.  Some might not agree because all the fat wasn't trimmed off.  Got there early so it wasn't busy. As it got closer to 7pm and trivia time, it got busier and we had to wait for our server to bring us the check. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is good. But the main reason ad came back is because if the superior service by Jorge.  He remembered us the second time we came in.  Even remembered the wine we like. Wonderful personality. Very professional. He could train the wait staff. We will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Really good British food. The poutine fries were really good as were the lamb sliders. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience coming here!!!! Been here a few times including 2 comedy nights and all were fun times. André is an AWESOME server there, knows his beer like no other and always helpful!! The owner is nice as well! Great food!! Amazing drinks!!! My new hangout place ;)"}
{"text":"I would recommend giving this place a try. Nice staff, nice environment. It was karaoke night and everybody had a good time."}
{"text":"How sad!!  The food here used to be great, but alas, no longer tis' so.  Stopped by to say bye to the bartender leaving for New Zealand, only to find he had been fired!  The Guinness BBQ wings used to be delicious, but now they just taste like plain old bad BBQ.  The fish and chips was once really 'the best in town', now it looks and tastes like the frozen Gorden's fisherman's fish from the grocery store.  Unbelievably the Guinness didn't even taste right!  It's better out of a can!!!  Not sure what happened but with the original staff gone and the food now very poor and substandard...sorry to say we won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for St Patricks day after going to their website to see what they had going on.
 
Their site showed that they had a St Patty's day celebration with live music. It also showed they had happy hour DAILY and buy one dinner get one 50% off. We thought it would be a good place to have a beer or two and eat an early dinner.  When we arrived we found out that there was a $10 cover, no happy hour and no dinner discounts.  I would call that false advertisement.

We decided to stay since we had people meeting us but the place sucked. Even if we didn't have to pay the cover and got the discount I wouldn't go back. I'm from England so may have pretty lofty expectations as far as the food in concerned but it wasn't even close to authentic and the beers were coming out 75% full.  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"The new owners have done a great job turning the place into a good spot to hang out. One of the better beer selections in town and events on most nights keep this place pretty busy. Food is above average but nothing to write home about. Typical English pub fare. Give it a shot and see if it is for you."}
{"text":"Nice place. The first time I went I had a hard time finding it. It is in a strip mall but then most of Vegas is. Food = good, beer selection = good, dog friendly patio = good, friendly staff = good... What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wow, sad to say this place has plummeted since we last visited.  Came on a Saturday early evening during NBA playoffs and the place was virtually empty (first clue).  The beer selection is still good, however the food we had was poorly cook and over oily/greasy (second clue).  The waiter was \"pushing\" the fish and chips (which we couldn't find on the menu so it must have been something special for that night) Had the sampler platter, eeech.  I thought the chicken tenders were the fish they were cooking and mistakenly been put on our platter.  Nope, called the waiter over, we cut the strip open and, indeed, it was chicken.  HOWEVER, I asked him to smell it and tell me with a straight face that it didn't wreak of fish.  He agreed and said the cook must have cooked it in the same oil as the fish because oil is expensive (third clue). WHAT?  that's not my problem, who the heck cooks anything in oil that fish has been cooked in.  Anyway, the waiter said he would replace it and came back relatively quickly with a nice big juicy looking tender.  I cut it open and it was raw in the middle (final straw).  OK, we're done with this place, finished our beers and left for the last time."}
{"text":"HUGE beer selection, GREAT service and staff, affordable prices and they always have something going on to enjoy (Karaoke Fridays are my personal favorite). Also, their food is really good! I was a bit hesitant at first (generally I'm not a fan of pub food), but they have a lengthy menu with some pretty tasty dishes (try the poutine!)

Check it out sometime. It's a blast."}
{"text":"I adore this place.  The lamb sliders or shepherd pie are my favorites.  Trivia night, comedy night or karaoke night, any night you go will be amazing!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at this \"pub\" for a pint of beer last night. When the foam settled on my Boddington's, it was only about three quarters of a glass of beer. The waitress came around to ask if we wanted another round, I replied that I had been shorted the first time. She responded that they always pour them that way. I'll going for a full pint somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I thought this was a non smoking place per advertising? Otherwise, I would have NEVER gone in!
I asked a smoker to put cigarette out & she didn't. I asked Bartender & he ignored me & then stating after certain time it's ok to smoke??? Is impression they gave. The 2 Bartenders there were rude & WOW especially the filthy woman Bartender! Unfortunately I was rude back. Point is if woman who just kept smoking would have put her cigarette out, then no problem. Us non smokers go there because it's SUPPOSED to be NON smoking. Jeff & Shannon are adorable & great Bartenders! I usually go there with group of non smoking friends & if they smoke they go outside. I'm totally wrong if smoking is aloud. I hadn't been there for while so maybe I didn't get memo.
I apologized to the woman Bartender for asking the woman to put cigarette out & stated she was a Bitch for continuing to smoke like she was so entitled. She (Bartender) called me a fucking cunt loud. So I went to her stupid level & then left. I wasn't bothering anyone.
I just wanted (to my knowledge) was non smoking place."}
{"text":"Googled English pub's and found Shakespeare's.  The waitress was super friendly and the Sausage rolls were Brilliant. I would also recommend the Fish & Chips. Great atmosphere, especially if you are a sports fan, which I am not. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This charming little gastropub might be a bit out of the way for some (and you can't immediately see it by driving either down Eastern Ave or Coronado so do Mapquest it first) but it's worth the search- a pub that combines the best parts of both a British and Irish Pub experience, including a Wednesday pub quiz, pool/dart areas and a couch area with fireplace and flat-screen TV just above it for a rustic venue to watch your footie or the NFL on. In good weather, you can even sit outside but we've never been here when it's been cool (or non-windy) enough to do so. 

The owner used to be the general manager of Fado Irish Pub on Eastern before it (sadly) closed and has brought much of the quality food preparation and wide beer and spirits selection along with him to this now British-predominant place. One of the best aspects in the bar area is one of those personal tap-tables with riser seats that allows you and 4-5 of your friends to pour your own Guinness or Harp while it keeps track of the pints drawn (and very accurately, too, down to the 100th decimal point!) Service has been good each time we've gone, too- not hovering but close by if you need something. 

The food is definitely of good quality, the presentation is great and not that expensive for the portion size and quality. The fish and chips portion is large and very good, the Shepherd's Pie is well-made and presented, bangers and mash are traditionally served and the corned beef sandwich is not made from sliced, round corned beef logs like at some other places, but from a true, uneven brisket piece. And did I mention the traditional British breakfast with all the right sausages and baked beans? They also have great hamburgers and salads, ideal for those who want British/Irish alcohol but not the cuisine that goes along with it (their loss, in my opinion...we've never had a bad meal of traditional British food here.)  

The ambience could be better, which is why it only gets four stars. Shakespeare's was not the first tenant of this space and they seem to have inherited a large portion of the old tables/chairs and room design, not all of which makes it look much like a British pub except for some posters and Guinness/Harp advertisements on the walls. But the casual tables-and-chairs set-up has its advantages if you have a group of friends who want to watch sports on any of their many TV's, for example, and the brickwork on some of the pillars gives it a bit of an Old World feel.

All in all, if you miss the old Fado (either on Eastern or when it was in Green Valley Ranch years ago), this is not a bad replacement. Even if there's more stress on Britain than Ireland now, they still serve an awesome pint of Harp to go with their steak and mushroom pie, and that's really all that matters."}
{"text":"The server was attentive and gave suggestions. We both had fish and chips, they were OK a little greasy, and over priced, no mushy peas (darn). Next time I'll try the bangers and mash. Beer selection was good"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon and pub was relatively quiet service was friendly and fast however food is utterly disgusting. Potato wedges with fish ,not chips or even french fries. over cooked highly processed sausages. Ive tasted better pototoes out of boxes and  potatoes previously frozen large ass fish fingers (battered cod).#fail"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my hotel room and it arrived within 30 minutes. It came perfectly warm. The fries were still crisp and the bread on my reuben was not soggy.  The food was amazing. Everything I expected. As someone who spends a lot of time in England, the food was very comforting. My props to the cook, and the delivery guy was very nice."}
{"text":"Nice, but not wonderful, selection of beer. The Guinness BBQ sauce covered wings were very good. The Caesar salad good, but also nothing special. The live music from the Killian's Angels was very good."}
{"text":"I used to go regularly to catch their karaoke show and it was great for a long time. Then slowly it stated to get over-run with a much older crowd. Like, it almost felt like a senior center was loading up a bus and bringing it in. Seriously, I think they may have been telling them it was an AARP meeting. hahahah... It was weird! So I found another place to patronize for karaoke. At a later date, I went back to see if things had improved. As I like the location, it is smoke free, and the staff was always pretty good. But, Shakespeare's has apparently burnt ties with some of the better karaoke brands in town and at this point they use some horrible karaoke service by the name of 'Kool Katz'. (OMG!) In short it's like three middle aged men hosting karaoke: that have the social skills and social depth of teen boys. They run the karaoke queue by putting themselves and their friend through the queue faster. They obviously need the power trip of being in charge of something, so karaoke does it for them. Not to mention they aren't very skilled with the audio engineering portions of the job so it doesn't sound very good compared to many of the other karaoke brands in town. I won't be back for karaoke there until I am sure they find a better option."}
{"text":"Hands down, best bar I've EVER been too. Literally no comparison when it comes to that one spot you go after a long day at work. 

Friendly staff (I.e Sidney, Jorge, Shannon, Corey). Always accomadating. I also love that whenever I have a fresh idea for a new drink, Shannon is on point! The selections that Joaquin and Shannon have are simply amazing! 

The food is as equally delicious as the beer selection. If you're looking for an inexpensive version of yard house, this is your place to go. 20 beers on tap, and 101 bottles. The food is also very Irish/British based. The chicken tenders are my ultimate favorite. 

Also, if you're looking for a hotspot that has something going on every night of the week, Shakespeare's has got you covered. Each day of the week there is a something going on. Thursday nights are ladies nights. Your very first drink is FREE! That's right FREE. Comedy night on Mondays is always great as well, I absolutely love Charlie!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for a Friday night.
Took forever for a menu/drinks, etc!
Will never be back.
Saw others leave because they never got service."}
{"text":"I have only ever eaten outside on a cool day with my dog. The fish and chips were the best I have ever had (and I travel a great deal). I like the clean and decorated interior, and the excellent service will bring me back again and again. Support your local businesses! These people are doing it right!"}
{"text":"This place is not cool to go gamble. I put In 70 dollars and got charged for the one beer i had, last time I go there"}
{"text":"Had the fish fry for our first visit. It was the best fish fry we have had anywhere in Las Vegas in almost 20 years. Crispy on the outside, flaky and moist on the inside. We see so many places advertise they have the best fish fry, but this one lives up to it's claim. Shelley, our server was very helpful and pleasant. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of people on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks. I had the cheeseburger and fries special for $8. The burger was really good and was pretty big. The bad news was they did not have Harp or Bass on tap which is weird for a pub to not at least have one of those so you can do a Black and Tan or Half and Half. The drinks were a bit pricey for a local pub but it seems like everywhere now has upped the alcohol prices. All in all a very nice local place with a good vibe."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment, but I think my problem may have stemmed from the fact that I ordered Mexican food from a British pub. But how can you mess up fish tacos? And my husbands burger was \"tasteless and dry\". He made the bonehead move of ordering American food at a British pub. So maybe we should have ordered fish and chips?"}
{"text":"The food & service was great! Our server, Jorge, was very attentive. I had the fish & chips and Judy had the blackened salmon. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"It's a pub with great beer selection (a group of friends were doing beer tasting), great wings and friendly bartender! What else do you need from a pub? :-)"}
{"text":"I will be moving to this side of town and was introduced to this pub through my papa! He actually just moved here and found this place while wondering one day. It is actually a realllly nice bar and grille. I almost bought one of their t-shirts, maybe next time though. The bartender was really nice to us. He was always checking in and chit chattin away. I enjoyed his company. 

I had the Shakespeare Sliders, and when it says comes with fries, its more like comes with amazing potato wedges! So delicious!! 

They also have this neat table in the middle of the bar where you can have like a drinking party! It has a keg underneath and 2 or 3 taps on top to pour your own beer. It has a meter attached to it, so you pay as much as you drink. I have never actually seen that before. I thought it was neat, could just be me and my little knowledge of brewery shenanigans.

They are HUGE rugby fans too! So awesome! I think I am going to enjoy this little pub in the corner! 

:)"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer and even better service. All the servers/bartenders are great but you have to 
see Andre when you come in, he's undoubtedly the very best! He's on top of it for sure, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple times for pub trivia.  The ambiance and decor provide for a great pub atmosphere.  Very spacious dining and bar area.  If I lived in the area I would definitely drop by for some of the premier league soccer games.  The premier league banners on the wall give the bar an atmosphere that is different from the standard cookie cutter sports bar.

Drinks are reasonably priced and mixed drinks are well made.  I've never had a beer there, but the selection looks pretty diverse and would appeal to beer aficionados.  The food is largely pub classics.  The battered chicken tenders are good and rate up there with some of the better chicken tenders in the Las Vegas bars.  The sausage rolls with aioli mustards are an excellent appetizer to share and were good as well.  There is not an item on the food menu that you would think of and say I have to go to this bar.  In fairness, that statement is true for 99% of the bar food in Las Vegas.

What really makes this place four stars is the service and friendly owners.  the staff goes out of their way to make your bar experience a quality one.  Somewhere John Taffer would be very happy."}
{"text":"i tried to order online using Postmates , they canceled \" my order twice after accepting the orders (Shakespeare's not Postamtes  ) , i spent an hour trying to order from them .  if you can not handle online orders do not sign up for those services ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, mostly because the lack of other options near by. Very comfortable place to watch the proper football, food is good but a bit on the pricey side for what you get.

I've yet to eat anything I haven't enjoyed and the staff has always been friendly.

I come in purely to watch the games and always have had a good time, the TVs are nice and they show all the games throughout."}
{"text":"The food is great here!  This was our first time here and I got the fish and chips.  The fish was perfectly fried and the steak fries were awesome.  My wife got the Reuben and it was piled high with hot and tender corned beef and sweet sour kraut.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am so bummed with the quality of the food, we couldn't eat it! We usually love the food, but tonight is another story.... We got our delivery in a timely manner. Super excited to eat my side salad and Mac and Cheese. They were BOTH INEDIBLE!! My salad was wilted and filled with brown pieces. My MAC and Cheese was gross. It was like they are using the cheap, fake cheese in it! Half the cheese wasn't melted, but in strips!?! The flavor was completely off and the texture was weird. Super greasy, I had two bites and had to stop. My husbands fries looked like they had been sitting out all day. I hope this was just a fluke!

** It was last night around 8pm"}
{"text":"BEWARE!

I went there Friday afternoon for a business meeting. Beers were $6 and we got the chicken skewers. It was a tiny breast piece of chicken wrapped around the stick then totally dried out. So gross. The sauce was disgusting. We got the \"JoJo\" fries. Mediocre, cold when we got them. Our food took forever and was cold when we got it. The place was completely empty! 

Worst part was I checked my bank statement yesterday and they waitress tacked on a $50 tip! She didn't even deserve the tip I gave her, let alone $50 for bringing out 4 beers and some crappy food. 

I drove to the restaraunt to get it taken care of, and there \"was no manager there\". How do you not have a manager on duty?! I gave them my number and I was nicely called back 24 hours later and told that I was refunded the $50. No offer to discount my check or real apology. Just excuses! This place is a fraud and I will NEVER go back. 

Disgusted!"}
{"text":"Herb is the fucking coolest, woo!!! Get good drinks and good service here for sure my fine people!"}
{"text":"Super fun menu full of great British treats for my houseguests!  The Brits loved it so much we had to go back a second time during their visit.  Too many choices!  Super service from a friendly waitstaff and excellent prices for huge portions.  My friend said the fish and chips was the best she'd had since a trip to England.  The philly cheesesteak sandwich was a hit with the men!  Fun sports bar with good food...it works!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer on tap. Fair price. Nice casual atmosphere. I like the vibe here. Attentive service. They have trivia nights on Tuesday/Wednesday.  I have yet to try the food tho."}
{"text":"This is a great place with good comfort food. The service is decent, but here's the warning ... if you pay with a credit card, they will charge you a fee and not tell you. I questioned why the bill went up 10% after she returned with my credit card and she explained that they charge a fee if a credit card is used. So pay in cash or be prepared to get ripped off. NOTE : 10% is above what Visa charges."}
{"text":"The waiter was extremely rude. When someone at our table ordered a chicken tiki masala and a soup the waiter rudely said \"woah that's way too much food!\" I've never heard of a waiter complain about someone ordering too much food. I can't understand why as a waiter you wouldn't want the bill to be higher, seeing as that usually means more tip money. There were about 80 people eating and drinking in the place and there was only one server and two bar tenders (I know because one of the comedians on stage mentioned them by name). Yes there was an amateur comedy show going on which I didn't mind. The food was mediocre at best. Also the Chicken tikki masala dish my friend ordered didn't have any chicken in it, when we mentioned it to the rude waiter he simply said \"it's shredded into the sauce\". The beer was good and the actual place is nice and spacious but they need to have more staff and a manager on sight. Terrible service, mediocre food probably won't be back unless it's to drink at the actual bar and not to eat."}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING!! The servers were great and I love the open concept layout. They have a blueberry beer that is to die for! I would recommended for a Sunday Funday of a Tuesday after work. Bottom line...YES!"}
{"text":"My Friend and I were coming back from a tennis match on the Henderson side of town and we saw Shakespeares's Grille and decided to try it.  We were greeted immediately right when we walked in the door by the GM Joey he was super friendly and made some suggestions on what to order for lunch,  My friend had the recommended Ruben and I had the Chicken Teriakai bowl  We decided to sit at the bar and play some video poker while we waited for our food to come. Our bartender was very friendly and welcoming and our food came very quickly and it was fantastic!  My friend is pretty picky and she said that was the best Rueben she's had in a very long time,  Wasn't fatty and the sauerkraut was very tasty that came with it.  Even her fries were great that I had to try.. My Chicken Teriyaki bowl was exactly what I wanted, I got the Teriakai sauce on the side so I could control how much I wanted to put on.  While we were eating I got 4 of kind and got to spin for an extra bonus of 25.00.  Cashed out and got on our way home but had a great experience at Shakespeare's...Would highly recommended it and I will definitely be back especially to try the fish & chips!
Side note ~ There is no smoking inside and that was a plus for us not to smell smoke when we walked in.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cozy neighborhood bar. Food is amaze balls, fish and chips will rock your world, so will the BBQ Burger and pretzel sticks with beer cheese! Bartenders a super cool too, and pour heavy!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for quite awhile and I have to say I'm sadly disappointed. We ordered ToGo and everything was off... The Fried Pickles and Sausage Rolls were incredibly soggy from all the grease. Ordered the Pub Mac and Cheese- yet it didn't have the bacon or jalapeños. It was just noodles with not even melted cheese! Maybe the food is better when ate at the actual restaurant... Or maybe we should just stick to the drinks next time!"}
{"text":"Love the Shepherd's Pie and Mac & Cheese.  There is something funky with their AC in the summer.  Maybe a Swamp Cooler?  Dunno but food is good."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday night football and found out that they are a Steelers bar!   Bartenders Lucia and Jamie are super attentive and knowledgeable about their extensive beer selection.  I had a great time!"}
{"text":"I have no problems with the food or wait staff, but as a regular pub quiz player on Wednesdays, I am disappointed in the changes to the pub quiz format, and that after a few weeks and vocal complaints from many participants, that it has not gone back to the original format. I don't think I can continue to support a business that doesn't meet the needs of its regular customers."}
{"text":"Went in the other night.  First off the server was great.  Kudos to him but....we had a coupon for two for one entree.  He cheerfully accepted.  I ordered Philly cheesesteak.  On the menu it says it comes with dipping sauce.  Au jus like a french dip. I ordered it because of this being offered. When it arrived it didn't have the sauce.  I asked the guy who brought my food (diff guy) and he brought me sauce in such a small cup that there is no way I could ever get the sandwich or any part of it in there. So the server brought me a bigger bowl (not more sauce btw). So now I have this huge bowl with almost no sauce.  About 7/8 the way through my sandwich I ran out of sauce and asked for more.  At that point he brought about a quart of it out...totally useless at this point because I was almost done.  On a separate note the meal came with a choice of side...in which I picked chicken noodle soup.  Now this was weird.  It was like they were at the bottom of the soup for the night....I got some broth with some spaghetti noodles on top and some diced chicken that had not even been in the soup yet.  The chicken was just sitting on top.  Strangest thing I've ever seen. Would've rather had the fries.  Chicken was terribly dry as well. On to my dining companion.  She ordered the burger.  He asked how she wanted it...she said med rare.  She cut it open in front on him and he agreed it wasn't anywhere near med rare...it was charred...so back to the kitchen.  The next one that came out wasn't close either.  She had one bite....ate the fries and called it good.  She went home hungry.  We also had to ask for napkins and flatware also....even after the food arrived.  They never noticed we didn't have any.  I ordered two drinks.  The server bought one of them for our inconvenience because he knew what happened but the burger was on the coupon so we were out $40 and the wife didn't eat.  Not a good night.  We live about 20 ft away and will not be back.  Too bad.  It sounds like this place has potential."}
{"text":"Luv this place! Great food, great drinks, friendly bar tenders and very clean!!!! Tell your friends if they want to enjoy some great times and friendly atmosphere to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little pub in near Silverado Ranch area. 
The staff here is awesome! They are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. 
The theme nights are a blast. It can get a bit crowded during the theme nights so be prepared to either sit on the comfy sofas or wait for a table. Just wish we would have showed up earlier for the trivia games. Next time we'll get there early! 
They have a huge beer list with quite a few on tap. Looking for a good Irish whiskey or Scotch? This is the place to go. 
I rarely buy bar t-shirts but had to get myself one from here. This place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We must have gone on a bad night. Service was terrible, it took forever to get our server to take our order, provide refills,provide to go boxes and to provide our bill. However I find it interesting that after the bill was dropped off, and we paid that the waiter picked up the bill with our money very quickly.

Food was fine. If it wasn't for the bad service we would return.. But don't think we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great beer! Plus its smoke free so you don't leave smelling like an ash tray! Definitely a new \"after work\" favorite place! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish, chips ok Poutine is Huge!!  Very good.  Husband says Guinness at the perfect temp.  We will be back  service was excellent"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this bar.  The bartenders are friendly, fast, and make amazing drinks. The atmosphere is always exciting but still quiet and intimate enough to have a conversation.  Trivia night is one of the absolute best anywhere, and they frequently play rugby on tv.  Anyplace that is advanced enough to play rugby is a sure fire hit in my book!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The service was great! I love all the stuff there. Also love the golden tee golf (; They have movie nights and comedy nights too. Very cool and positive environment that I usually don't get at most pubs and bar/grills."}
{"text":"I read that you serve yourself up your own Guinness and thought I would check it out.    

SG&P is much larger then it appears from the outside and on a Monday there was but a few people. 

For some reason I was expecting more to having access to your own tap of Guinness when I discovered that there was only one table that provided this convenance.  After ponying up to the table the experience fizzled out much like the foam did from the tap.  Alas, the self dispensing Guinness table would not work.  Not to be detoured from at least having a couple of drinks we just ordered from the bartender.

Since it was lunch time I ordered up some fish and chips to compliment atmosphere and the beer.  They were OK and so was the overall experience."}
{"text":"Just left there.  Never been moved to write a review on anything.  Stopped by to play a little keno..I'm generally a $100-$300 depending on how it's going.  People sitting in front of all 15 machines and not a soul playing....you would think the bartender knows for her to make $$ she needs people playing...ran over to winchells and hit a five spot right away..tipped the bartender $20 and I'm out..I'm sure the regulars taking up all the machines took care of the gal at Shakespeare's...c ya"}
{"text":"Seriously great place.  We come to trivia every Wednesday and have a blast, food and drinks as well as service are all awesome. Wish it was closer to my house and I'd be there more often. The fish & chips are best I've had in town by far."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a recent happy hour. They don't really have any great happy hour drink specials. Well drinks are BOGO @ $10 so they were still $5 each during happy hour? What kind of happy is that? #ShakespearesFail. Service was ok. Server kept trying to be funny & it just got annoying after awhile. Ordered up the fish tacos (2 for $5) on the happy hour menu. Meh. Taco shell was so rubbery it was hard to get a decent bite when the taco wasn't actually falling apart in your hands. Not sure what they put on it to make it so wet but when I finally got to the 2nd taco the shell itself busted when I picked it up so I opted to just eat the food inside the taco shell rather than the whole taco. Didn't have much flavor. I won't be going back again. A shame too since it's a local bar to my area."}
{"text":"Super chill bar with great service and lots of craft beers on tap and in the bottle. Would definitely recommend coming on Sundays at 6 for their music bingo!"}
{"text":"Heads up: HH is only Mon-Fri, even though their website advertises it as daily. Staff is aware of this, yet no one has bothered to update the site in (their estimate) 2 years?!

The Yelp Book Club timed our visit for HH, so being rudely informed that it didn't exist wasn't the best start to our visit. Our server came by twice in 45 minutes and drinks took 20 minutes to come out. We had to go to the bar to place an order- and we were the only table. With such aggressively unhelpful service, the food did not make up for our experience.

POUTINE: This spot goes the extra mile to bread and fry the cheese curds. So the dish is basically cheese fries with cheese sticks, with some underwhelming Guiness gravy. Fries were unseasoned, gravy was lackluster, dish went unfinished split among three people.
SOUP OF THE DAY: $5 for their daily bowl, which was chicken curry. It was mostly rice and had no spice, as though this were Campbell's interpretation of a curry. Not thrilled.
SCOTCH EGG: Sausage was eerily reminiscent of a breakfast sausage, but the mustard aioli on the plate kicked things up a level. This is sided with a heap of spring greens they call a salad, but nothing else. Odd.
STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Spiced and sauced bundt cake, with a bit of whipped cream. This version does not come close to comparing to any others in town. Go elsewhere for your fix. Another unfinished dish for us.

Dismal food and shitty service make for a large empty bar in the middle of the weekend, despite large screens showing multiple sports games. I wouldn't recommend this spot and I won't be back. Crown & Anchor has friendly service, a similar menu, and better quality."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I like places this much the first time.  It has a great atmosphere, and made me feel welcome. 
 I will definitely be there on in quiz nights. And the food is worth it by itself."}
{"text":"Shakespeare's Grille & Pub was in my bookmarks for quite some time. Due to increasingly negative reviews it started to fall far down the priority list. Friday night, one of my best friends and I decided to do light bar hopping in Anthem and Shakespeare's was brought up. The space inside was quite large. I was expecting a dark and dingy dive bar, but it was actually decently lighted, clean, and very spacious. After chatting with the bartender, who was very friendly and accommodating, we found out that this place is now under new ownership. Then we got to chat with the new owner. He was extremely friendly and accommodating as well. He expressed great interest in customer feedback, yelp, and ways to appease his customers in general. He told us they are simplifying and redesigning the menu, and although we did not order any food, I am sure I will be back to sample some of the fare they have to offer. 

The owner also has fun events planned for each day of the week such as trivia night, karaoke night, and even bringing in live bands. That sounds petty awesome for a little neighborhood bar!  They also have the TouchMusic jukebox of which I am the master with my little app. Another bonus! We had a slew of drinks for $20, so this is definitley not a \"strip\" priced bar which is a great thing. Give it a shot! I am thinking of organizing a UYE here sometime down the line."}
{"text":"The owner/manager set his staff up for failure today. One bartender, out of 4 tap beers, and a full house for Soccer Championship game. So bad that a friend/customer is helping with drink orders.
250 beers are excellent when you don't have to wait 30 mins to order one."}
{"text":"Had a great time there at the comedy show the service was fantastic, the food mouth watering and the place was clean and very exciting.also a plus the food was affordable...."}
{"text":"Love this spot ! It's extremely \"chill\". Love the patio area outside to hang with your friends, beer in hand, smoking a cig. & their draft selection is the sh*t !!! :) Service is always legit !!"}
{"text":"Not your typical gaming bar, although the ambiance might suggest this.  When you look a little past the 24 hr. Gaming you'll see an amazing beer list, rivaling many of the tap houses around town. There beer program is on point with things like evil twin Molotov cocktail on tap, and Dogfish Head 120 for sale. The food is typical bar food pumped up a bit. Offerings like poutine fries, and street tacos, and just about anything you could think of. The service is outstanding. The bartender, Kelly, is friendly knowledgeable and fast. The other patrons of this bar are nice and welcoming, make you feel like you're right at home."}
{"text":"I like hanging out here.  Nice to sit on the patio and grab a cold beer on a warm evening. They have an amazing selection of bottled and beers on tap.  There are different events here depending on the night.  Trivia night, this place gets pretty packed.  The service needs improvements tho.  I have yet to try the food."}
{"text":"Service was Fantastic!

It was clean, quiet (for a Saturday) and they have free darts and $1 Pool which we played.   Small menu to choose from but we were dicing and didnt get any choices anyways!

Dice made me get a burger with blue cheese and egg, It was OK--I kind of found the meat chewy, maybe it was the fattiest meat, Just not what I am used to eating but my ex also ordered a burger and didnt care for it, I thought, well maybe because I am mostly Vegan, I just dont like meat anymore but that was not the case!

Friend ordered the teriyaki bowl and loved it.   The chili was ok but NOT spicy at all.   

Probably wouldnt return..."}
{"text":"I love this place, although recently changed owners, we haven't seen a change/drop in quality. The staff is always on it and they have lots of fun things like trivia nights. (Beware the smatypants table at trivia, the same table always crushes it- it's not me). The food is great and they have a fantastic beer selection. Game days rock here too."}
{"text":"Service was good  but a little slow.... but not saying it as a bad thing...poor waitress was all by herself to take care of the entire floor! Food was pretty good. And beers were....interesting to say the least but overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing it was just Fish & Chips. But I'm a Native Vegan and for a Bar and Grill type Pub with a very cool atmosphere. I recommend this location for a great experience. Oh and Shelly the Bartender/Waitress/Everything was Amazing as well and the place was about half packed. Cuddos to Shelly Job Well Done!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! It's nice and cozy with tables and sofas. Plenty of screens to watch any sports games. If you want a more chill experience, you can sit outside. There was karaoke tonight which was fun! They have it every Friday and live music Saturdays.

Oh. My. Gosh! The food! Blows Gordon Ramsay's pub and grille out of the water! My husband had the fish and chips which were decadent and cooked to perfection! Actual British chips unlike Gordon's shoestring fries and for half the price. I had the lamb sliders served with a brown gravy which was truly DIVINE! I could just eat a bowl of gravy and be a super happy camper!

We will most definitely be back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great pub right down the road. They have a clean friendly enviroment with great food and service. Great place to watch any soccer match or other sporting events."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice atmosphere for a bar in a strip mall.  Large open spaces, NO SMOKING, lots of great beers on tap.  

There is a large projector screen and several TVs scattered around the bar,  this would be a great place to watch a game.

Pool tables, Golden Tee and a juke box!"}
{"text":"Ordered a blt sandwich on Uber eats not realizing I had accidentally put the wrong delivery address, I called Uber eats right away to see about canceling the order, they called the restaurant and Shakespeare's said they would not cancel it because they had already started making it, I couldn't have it delivered to where it was going to because I am on the complete opposite side of town, so now I am still charged $21 and have no blt sandwich.  I understand that it was my mistake but what would happen if someone called in an order directly from you guys and they just never picked it up, they wouldn't be charged for it.  Customer service should always come first and I hope that $21 was worth losing a loyal customer for life who will never spend another dollar with you again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Shakespeare's for the last several months solely for their Wednesday night live trivia contests; I live too far to frequent it otherwise. The wait staff have always been prompt and courteous, so no complaints there. My current issue, which I took up directly with the owner, is a format change in their contests, wherein they will no longer have a moderator reading a couple of the rounds' questions. It feels less participatory, and as a result, less fun, in a team context, to remove that element of interplay.

In defending his \"tweaking\" of the format, he seemed to be significantly overstating the frequency and repetition of questions that required clarification, and that, he claimed, was disturbing some of the bar-top poker machine players. Given that they probably draw upwards of 80-100 people every Wednesday for these contests, I think a few questions repeated over the PA for clarification are a small price to pay, when one considers the risk of losing the many players who like the new format less or not-at-all."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection for a neighborhood joint, good food (except the scotch egg, everything else has been solid), good atmosphere to hang out with friends.  The two sort of weak points are the design and service.  Something about the layout causes smells to waft from the kitchen into the bar area, which is fine when it's food, not so much when it's cleaning solutions.  

The other iffy is the service from male wait staff, the bartenders and female wait staff are fine.  They go a long time between visits, which is fine when you've got time, but annoying when it takes twenty minutes to place your food order if you made the mistake of knowing what you wanted to drink.  The general attitude from male wait staff is that they'd rather be elsewhere, although a couple are sufficiently knowledgeable about beer and not listed bottles to make up for the lackluster approach to the rest of their job."}
{"text":"Just ordered from them on Uber eats. We got chicken wings, grilled cheese and a quesadilla. All were terrible. We just had to throw it all away.  The wings were all fat, the grilled cheese was like two pieces of cardboard with rubber in the middle and the steak in the quesadilla was just plain gross.  I was hoping this place would be great but sad to say it was nothing close."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer. 

Many great beers on tap and in the bottle. They have a wide selection of food. The fish and chips were ok, must have had a bad batch, everyone else was raving, ours was just ok."}
{"text":"Really a mostly comic, somewhat dramatic but never tragic experience! Nina was great fun and made my solo trip full of bonhomie!"}
{"text":"Went for trivia night and was severely disappointed. The food was pretty terrible- my scotch egg was over fried, the sticky toffee pudding was hard as a rock atrocious, the cheesecake was grainy, and, with the bar focused on beer, the drinks were so-so.  The kitchen definitely failed on getting orders out on time and well cooked. 
They might have been overwhelmed by the trivia night crowd, but the service was abysmally slow. It took well over 25 minutes to get an appetizer and 2 of the other things we ordered never even showed up (we were a table of 5, nothing crazy). The server was kind and never showed us any frustration, but she just couldn't get the job done. 
The beer selection is massive so I suppose you could make a night of it with the entertainment- they do have a lot going on, just eat somewhere else first and order your drinks 2 at a time."}
{"text":"Jamie is a great bartender and also a great food served as well. She always tells us what is good on the menu and she always suggests good drinks from the bar. She takes the time to actually listen to her customers. Jamie is the only reason that we come into Shakespeare's."}
{"text":"Funny start to my first time here.

We just walked in the door to see a waiter accidently dump a glass of water down someone's back at a large table. Looked like an entire family was being served and they had their hands full. So, given the place was nearly empty just after 5pm on the weekend I wondered what was going to happen next...

Service was fairly prompt as other patrons filtered in with some choosing general seating with others going to the bar. Had a wonderful fish & chips dinner. small crowd so service was, as expected, on par with expectations. Cod was very good and large...fries were tasty with generous helping and the Red Hen [something] craft was unique given the jalapeno bite at the end of each sip. Apparently it was brewed in Henderson(?)

Staff remained on top of things as well as being polite so good tip was the reward. Plenty of big screens...nice \"old world\" style decor with a mix of modern flair.

Parking was crowded as they share spots with many other establishments in a typical collage mixed strip mall set up.

Will be back to try a new dish (corned beef or other) for sure. Maybe we'll get to see if they can maintain service and food quality while juggling a larger crowd. I've read some of the 1 and 2 star ratings. Wow. With that in mind I'll update after a second visit.

Edit: Took home leftover cod and fries for part of next nights dinner - very yummy after removing from toaster oven."}
{"text":"We go on Wednesday when thay have the trivia game..Food is not bad..Fun place and very crowded on Wednesday"}
{"text":"I've been here once so far, but I am excited to try it again. Seems like a great strip mall find.

My friend arrived first, and after eating their wings and burger, called me with the insistent demand that I must come check this place out. He assured me that the wings were fantastic, especially for 6 wings being less than $6. However, as I didn't even see, let alone taste, the wings or burger, I can't really comment. But suffice it to say that my friend swears they were delicious.

After checking-in on Foursquare and getting a \"special offer\" for 20% off an appetizer, I decided to order their mac 'n' cheese. It arrived in what is typically a french onion soup bowl. All crispy cheese goodness on top and ooey, gooey, swimming in tons of cheese on the inside. I have no clue what cheeses were used (and the menu offers no description), but it was excellent. At first glance, it seemed like a small serving, but after digging in, it became clear that there was no way I was going to finish it - very filling. Based on the mac 'n' cheese (and my friend's insistence on the excellent wings), I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.

And they have a better than average selection of beer. Bartenders were nice, if a little inattentive. Good space and set-up. All in all, it is winning so far over the other bars in my immediate area. Here's hoping the return visit holds up."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last week and was pleasantly surprised.  When we walked in we were a little concerned as the place seemed quite empty, it was around 7:00pm on a Sunday night.  We decided to sit at the bar have dinner maybe play a little poker/blackjack.  We looked over the menu, which was a bit eclectic, but all sounded appetizing.  A local bar fly, seemed to have the Norm at Cheers thing going on, suggested we try the fish and chips--so we did and it was deliciously!  We also had a potato jalapeno soup quite tasty!  Mike was our waiter/bartender very nice and quite attentive.  Would definitely return.."}
{"text":"Terrible food. The only thing that wasn't microwaved was my wife's burger. Our server was also not great,Spanish guy,very cocky and was slower than frozen molasses. We were there during a local brew fest,the beer was far from good which would explain why nobody was there. I will not make a future return visit."}
{"text":"Jorge was the best server yet!!! He was very attentive and brought my cocktails right away. I would return with Jorge as my server!"}
{"text":"Four people ordering breakfast.
First of all...our server, Shelly, was very nice.  We understand a server can only deliver food after it is prepared.  So it would not be fair to say poor service.  We were the only ordering customers.  Our food took a long time to be prepared.  My biscuits and gravy were Luke warm and TASTELESS.  The other ordinary bacon, eggs and undertoasted, unbuttered sourdough bread was at least edible.
 I actually do not understand this restaurant could serve anything worth eating.
Don't bother ....to many great restaurant"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I literally just walked out of this establishment i sheer disappointment. 

My girlfriend is from england and was extremely excited to have a full english breakfast. We walked up to the bar and this young blonde woman approached us and asked \"what can i get you to drink\". We ordered two waters and two full english breakfasts \"in a thick english accent\".

We then play two games of pool before being served two plates of an american breakfast. 

I return to the bartender with the food (we did not order) & she says oh hahaha im sorry. 

She was dropping glasses behind the bar, seemed overwhelmed, and really inexperienced.

We wont be returning here again!"}
{"text":"It's time I reviewed this local bar/pub since I frequent it with my friends every Wednesday night for Trivia Night. The first time my husband and I happened upon it, we walked into a huge Jayhawks party. Turns out it's a KU alumni hub as well. This is a fun place, sports bar and English pub with the best Fish and Chips in town. Come for Trivia on Wednesdays or Karaoke Fridays or any day. But here's the important part... ask for Andre's section. He's your new best friend!"}
{"text":"No it was a few weeks ago and it was busy. We will try you out again as we have heard you are a Steelers bar"}
{"text":"Its a little drive for us but well worth it! I love the staff here, and the food and drink is just amazing. Its not a fancy place but has excellent pub food! Favorites so far are a steak sandwich, burger, meat pies, and these potato chip dish I can't remember the name of. Some sort of nacho I think. ANYWAY, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just started going to this pub as I moved here recently. It's about my 3rd or 4th time. There is a day shift bar tender that's really cool in fact, I lost $300 once and she bought me breakfast which made me feel good and I came back. The first time was a night bartender and he was awesome as well. Tonight however, two bartenders were here and one worse than the other. Never once came over and asked me if I wanted a drink until I called one over. I asked for a beer and she rudely said while rolling her eyes \"ya what kind\" as if totally impatient. Most bar tenders smile and greet you, especially if you've never met them. I had a few $100 bills on the table to play and one would think that commands at least a greet or some sort of professional hello. When my food came (great food btw) I had fries and she didn't even offer me ketchup or a napkin and certainly never another beer. It was a horrible experience and all they did was gossip in the corner together. I will never come here on a Friday night again. They are a poor reflection of your business."}
{"text":"Great local spot with over 100 craft beers.  Need I say more?  Looking forward to coming here again"}
{"text":"Trivia here on Wednesdays is really fun.  Some of my friends complain it is hard to hear, but I think they just don't really pay attention.  The food and service are very good."}
{"text":"A Guinness and Harp tap at your own table??  SNAP!  Too bad there's only one table like that, but the cost would be prohibitive to do them all.  This place isn't much for atmosphere and on Wednesday night we always get the slowest server ever.  However, it's a lovely, quiet place for lunch, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap, video poker if you want it and it's a FUN place to go.  For some reason it always seems just a bit too warm inside, even in the winter.  Weird.  But I would go.  Get the curry sauce to dip your fries in.  The sausage rolls are DIVINE!"}
{"text":"Yummy food in this pub and great tasting beer. A must swing in and enjoy the environment and staff. We showed up on a Wednesday evening and they had some kind of trivia night which was a lot of fun just too be around. They had a few pool tables as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Potato wedges come in a very large portion for $4. Add some fish tacos from the happy hour menu (2 for $5)and you are set. This is the same fish as the fish and chips, great crispy battered pieces.

The service can be a bit slow but the folks always seem friendly, even with nondrinkers in the party. Lots of room and it is always nice to be able to choose where you want to sit. Lots of TVs around for the sports minded."}
{"text":"So good. Just so good. Fish and chips are to die for. Perfectly battered. Homemade tartar sauce and coleslaw. Amazing potato wedges. I love Shakespeare's!!!"}
{"text":"thanks to dana s for the uye trivia. they had kilkenny so i was happy. ordered the shepards pie. they turned the top of the gravy into a zen garden with cool designs. it had a good salt level. some places go way overboard on the salt. our waiter was a good character and had no problem doing separate checks! 

the quiz portion was fun! although i think our large group was excited and yelling out answers. i was guilty of this as well. after the quiz ended it got really quiet. a little too quiet.

[The three Turtles infiltrate The Shredder's junkyard.]
Donatello: The perimeter's quiet.
Leonardo: Yeah, a little too quiet.
Michelangelo: Come on.
[The Turtles sneak forward; Donatello takes out two sentries solo]

Michelangelo: Yeah, a little too Raph.

when i first used the bathroom i kept trying to lift the handle to wash my hands at the sink, but realized after like 2 attempts that it was an automatic faucet that looked like a handle. tricky... very tricky..."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place after seeing it on Groupon (or living social) several times and never really paying attention to where it was. Found the atmosphere to be delightful cozy, service, impeccable, and the menu affordable, and delicious. We weren't here to drink, but they do have an extensive beer menu, which I took advantage of. I love trying different beers, especially if the only way I can try them outside of a bar is in a 6 pack of bottles for 30 bucks. No thanks! Anyway we got a hodge podge of food. Buffalo Mac and Cheese, poutine with Guinness and onion gravy, and a Rueben sandwich. Buff was AWESOME. I love mac and cheese and this was fantastic. Poutine was good, not as magical as I wanted, because the idea of Guinness gravy sounded amazing. Oh well, still very good. The Rueben was ok, but I don't like Rueben Sandwiches, so that's an unfair judgement. It was pretty neutral in flavor so I could eat it. (Not a fan of corned beef) The price was very inexpensive for what we got and as I said the sevice was top notch. I don't know what this place is like usually, but it seemed fairly low key and quiet, which totally suits us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago because my friend was having an event there. I have to say it was a little difficult to find. I guess I just assumed it was a stand alone building but was surprised to find it in group of other buildings. Tons of beer on tap which is a huge plus! I tried a few different ones but needless to say I can't remember which ones! I didn't try any of the food but I heard it was ok. They also have a fire pit out front which was cool to sit around towards the end of the night."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find this place, which was close to where we wanted to go for the evening.  We were heading over to Green Valley Resort, and we stopped here at about 8pm on Saturday, August 20th. 

It was just two of us, and we found a table right in front of a big screen that was playing NFL Preseason football.  The restaurant/bar itself was actually a great place, well laid out with lots to see and do.   

Our server, which referred to himself as the beer connoisseur was very friendly, nice and helpful.  Kudos to him!

However, sorry to say, the food left a lot to be desired.  We ordered the English Nachos and the Sampler Basket and we shared both.  On the Sampler Basket, the chicken tenders and poppers were way overcooked -- in fact the poppers were actually blackened/burnt.  The wings and onion rings were pretty good.  The menu says it comes with three sauces; however, ours only came with Ranch.

The nachos were plentiful; however, the taste was pretty bland and nothing exciting.

Could I have mentioned something while I was seated and eating -- sure I could have.  However, I am not the type of person that likes complaining about my food while in a restaurant.   

So, again, on the positive side, the portions were plentiful and our server was nice.  I would try this place again in the future (maybe in a couple of years) to see if the food has improved to my tastes."}
{"text":"What a fun place.  Andre our waiter was fantastic.  The food was great and the atmosphere even better.  Brought our dog and he was treated like a king!  Sat on the patio and enjoyed a beautiful night."}
{"text":"Would definitely give this spot a five star but service really sucked once the regulars came in. We had excellent service at the beginning but once the bartenders friends showed up we were ignored. As I write this the bartender has passed my empty glass 4 times to speak to her friends. And yeah she's looked our way. Great beer selection. My brother said the food was good. I would have ordered if we weren't being passed up. Cheers"}
{"text":"Poutine with cheese curds yum! Mashed potatoes perfect. Cabbage soup delicious but super small portion for $5 :( leaving me disappointed. Fish tacos superb!"}
{"text":"Recap & review, to me it was just a normal pub \"ordinary\". The food was okay, nothing to really get excited about. I observed that they were short staffed, Jorge our server/waiter/busser/pre-cook and who knows what else? Had made a huge difference. He was on it! There was another big group including ours and he managed to take care of all of us. Kudos to Jorge! i had stumbled my way back into the kitchen when i noticed him prepping food, of course i had to make things more difficult by ordering something that wasn't on the menu. He kindly obliged. Whoa! this guy has heart. 
What made this pub nice was the patrons, the patrons made everything come alive. good food, good drink, good people and that hilarious card game. Passer byes stopped to ask what group we were in and what the heck we were doing. I guess we get a little silly and we do laugh a lot, literally \"laughing out loud\". i do apologize if i had offended anyone, i do get a little out of hand, i'm really not that guy. Anyhow, we had a good time and i even got a Shakespeare's T-shirt (i like collecting stuff). Upon leaving i shook Jorge's hand and thanked him for his service, i left him a generous tip. 
My suggestion, though it's not the greatest pub, it is a pub and if you want a good experience bring lots of people and that funny card game. I'm still laughing at the answers. (oh yeah, the juke box was annoying)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice Saturday dinner with wife here. Wasn't greeted by anyone when we first came in, but it is a pub primarily.  Our server came by and was very attentive.  We tried the fried pickles, which were cut like french fries, a large portion, and very good. Wife ordered the shepherd's pie. She liked it and ate all of it. I thought it could have been a larger portion actually,  as it was seved in thin dish, but  it needed to be a deeper dish. I ordered the fish fry, which was a huge portion of two large fillets on a mound of fries and small side of slaw. This could easily serve two, or inquire about a half portion. It tasted very good. We had a few beers, in the $7 range. Atmosphere was good. Clean, no  smoke, a couple dart boards, one pool table,  large interior on the dark side. My wife and I were very pleased overall and definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Super fun pub to go to!!!! Good food and great variety of beer!!! Love going to the pub music bingo on sundays!!!! The lady who runs it is super fun nice and helpful!!!!! We had a blast and came back the next week!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Fish n Chips in town! Cozy laid back unpretentious atmosphere. Feels like the ones I used to go to back in Boston. Poutine is also great. Prices are reasonable with great lunch specials and a lot of food for the money. So much better than the overpriced pseudo gastro pubs on the strip. This place is also great for kids. Pool table and darts to keep them happy and not a bunch of obnoxious drunk people hanging around."}
{"text":"Super fun English pub over on Eastern, which gets PACKED on Tuesday and Wednesday for Trivia nights. Be sure to get there early to get a table or else you'll have to fight for a spot at the bar. Large food menu with yummy British fare e.g. chips and curry, fish and chips, shepherds pie, etc...all reasonably priced and large portions, not greasy. 

HUGE beer menu! It features many of the local breweries such as Tenaya, Banger, and Bad Beat, and has everything from Sculpin, to Delirium, to Polygamy Porter."}
{"text":"The best thing here is Andre. He is the reason we come here. He is by far one of the best servers I have ever come across. The 1 star is for the new karaoke host here. They are by far the worst I have seen. I have been to many across the country and they are the worst. There are 4 of them, they make sure all of the friends are at the top of the rotation. If they don't know you, you won't have a prayer of singing for at least 2 hours or more."}
{"text":"This pub sells my favorite type of food to eat while drunk, which includes: sloppy poutine, nachos, burgers, and wings. In addition, it's always got a great selection of local beers. We went here lay night, Thursday night and partook in local news night which was 4 dollar drafts. We had 4 milk shake style beers that captured my heart. After getting nice and toasty, our waiter was supportive of us relocating to a pool table where we continued to try a few new beers. That was my kind of night.

Anyways, here's the gist of it. Shakespeare's has a rotating selection of beers so I am always able to try something new. The food is great for a pub restaurant, but I come for the beer. Service is usually good, and there is something different each day. Wednesday's I think they have trivia and Fridays they do karaoke. There's always enough parking and a chill crowd. When I want to drink socially, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Can't wait to go back!  We will definitely try sitting outside.  I love that they have a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas and joined my friend for her son's 21st birthday at Shakespeare's.  What a great place and atmosphere.  Incredible service, can't remember our servers name but he was exceptional, drinks were good and the food was delish!  Their breaded chicken strips, sliders and fries were out of this world.  Wish I could have eaten more, but I was stuffed.  Will visit again when in town."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the service makes it so hard. Bartenders seem to only want to talk to regulars or friends than serve anyone else. 6 people sitting at the bar and it takes a long time to get any attention to get a drink. She said she was a little backed up yet always had time to chat with her friends. Third time I have been here, shame on me for giving it three times before throwing in the towel. If the bartenders start paying attention to non friends I might be back, but doubtful. Such a shame, great beer selection, it just so hard to actually get one."}
{"text":"Went for my first time this weekend and the bartender was extremly friendly and nice. She was the only one working and on top of it. My drink was always filled and she was very easy to talk to. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was very good for bar food. We had steak & mushroom pie & chicken tikka masala.  Both meals were very good.  Our bartender,Lucia, was extremely personal & helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I made a visit to this bar late last night to see some amazing comedians for open mic night. I was getting a little hungry waiting for the show to start. I decided to look at a menu while I waited. The waitress was very concerned about what I wanted to order which made me very pleased with this experience. Usually, the waitress will walk away to give me a second and think. Not today my friends! She held my hand and told me everything was going to be ok! Also, she told me that my heart was made of gold. I was convinced I was going to marry this waitress!


I ended up ordering the Beer Battered Chicken Fingers w/ fries. 

Let me tell you that at first I was worried. 
$9 for some chicken fingers? 
Is McDonalds open?!

I followed through to eat this amazing creation. Overall, the chicken fingers are definitely in their own category. I forgot to mention that I am a chicken finger ambassador! 

The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the amount of ranch I received. I love ranch with my chicken fingers. That's just how I roll!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, the food is made with love for sure. Everything we have ordered recently is delicious. I have only had it delivered. The food is always hot, correct is delivered quickly within 30. Min. The Rachel is my new favorite sandwich ever. Good job guys."}
{"text":"corned beef sandwich is good.  beers are good and the price is well.  Check in for a discount."}
{"text":"I was in there on a Friday night...great time. Very fun atmosphere. Bartender working was Lucia...she was awesome! Very attentive...great personality...and answered all our questions about beers and promotions. I even won on the machines while I was there. Big thank you to Lucia! I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. The waitress was nice, but a little scatterbrained -- my friend and I ordered Crabbie's Ginger Beer (They have Crabbie's!), but she brought us Newcastle Cabbie Ale because she didn't realize there were two similar sounding beers on the menu. But she took care of it right away. They were also out of the whiskey (McAllen) and beer (Dogfish Head 90) that the guys ordered, which was disappointing for them. On the plus side, they've got darts and pool. Crabbie's, darts, and pool -- pretty much all I need in a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Wow! Justin and Cory have really made Shakespeare's an awesome place to hang out and get some good food. This has become one of my favorite hangouts because it's such a comfortable environment and the bartenders and wait staff are amazing. It's like the \"Cheers\" of Henderson for us, because \"everybody knows your name.\" Shannon, Jeff, Jorge, Lucia are always treating us special. We love to go for Wednesday pub quiz/trivia and often on Fridays (the karaoke night gets some awesome singers)."}
{"text":"There are so many pubs in Vegas, it's hard to choose a favorite. But, if I lived closer I could see how this place could become a favorite.

There's plenty of parking and when we were there for a late lunch there was plenty of seating. Plus a real bonus is that it's all non-smoking except on the patio. 

Had super friendly service from Shelly.  She did a great job suggesting a brew (Victory at Sea Coconut - Ballast Point Brewing), it was a super good Porter with just the right amount of chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavoring with a strong but very tasty coconut flavor. Unusual, but easy, pleasant and very good.

For food we had the Poutine, Fish & Chips and a Burger. Everything was very good and very favorable. 

Again, a place that's easy to like and enjoy. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Taming of the brew.

This might become one of my regular haunts, mostly because the drinks are strong and I can crawl home. I decided  to stop here on a random Tuesday night before calling it a night and was greeted by the sounds of \"Pub Trivia Night\". \"Where was Britney Spears born?\",  \"ummm...the South?\" I thought as I bellied up to the bar. 

I dig the decor in this place; old school lanterns, unique European chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and a giant British Flag above the bar, so Londony! As I looked at the bar menu I noticed that they serve Poutine! The American werewolf in my belly growled as I ordered this insanely rich dish and a fresh adult beverage. If you're not familiar with this traditionally Canadian dish, Poutine is a decadent pile of french fries, cheese curds and gravy, be still my beating heart. No seriously, it could have stopped while I was consuming it. Shakespeare's Pub also has a bevy of beers on tap, but I went with the vodka & soda. I wasn't sure if I could handle a Stout beer along with gravy soaked cheese fries. 

As I waited for my food and drink, I chatted it up with the bartenders and got the 4-1-1 on the trivia nights. Not is only does it get packed in here every Tuesday and Wednesday, but if your team wins you get to sit at what I'm calling the \"Champions' Table\". It's a table with a beer tap attached, serving of course, Guinness and Harp. I'm not sure if the winners get to choose the beers. As I pondered the idea of adding a toilet to a table that I would never have to leave, my Poutine arrived in all of it's gravy and cheese covered glory. Now a normal or \"classic\" Poutine would have regular cheese curds. However, in the Shakespeare's Pub version they are breaded and fried. AMAZING! I dived in fork first. 

I consumed about half of this order along with some help from my girlfriend, after which my food coma took over. Love this place, love the people who work here, and love/hate the Poutine. To quote Shakespeare...

\"Unquiet meals make ill digestions\", True Dat! 

I will definitely be coming back to Shakespeare's Grille and Pub."}
{"text":"Shakespears is hands down the best local gaming bar in the Henderson/Vegas area.  I refuse to play machines anywhere but here.  The machines are looser then any where else I have played and I have had a ton of luck.  I'm hooked on the video poker machines at the bar and I swear I can't lose when playing them. 

The food and drinks are 10/10 and service is always on point.  Friday nights are great for karaoke and Sundays are always fun for music bingo. Overall this is a great place to come and have some drinks with friends but even better for a fun night of gambling"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the service is great...I heard a customer say they were disappointed in the place because the couldn't accomidate a large party during World Cup...lol..You go to an English pub on World Cup with a large party without a reservation....That's smart...but it's the places fault...lol!!! Large Party = Reservation...duh...This place is great.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday Brunch a couple days ago.

Sat outside which was great since the sun was out and the skies were blue... gotta take advantage of the nice weather while it lasts.

It's a small area outside but there was no one there but my group so it worked out good for us.

The inside is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  It's nice inside... not too dark and not stuffy.  There are video poker machines at the bar.

Good place to hang out.

And it's good for groups because they were able to do individual checks.

Menu wasn't super extensive but it included some nice options.

The service is OK.... I think it's cuz we sat outside that the servers were a bit less attentive.  Not sure. The gal got my order wrong but I'm not holding that totally against her ...  she probably didn't hear me correctly over everyone's talking.

The food... taste... preparation.... mediocre.  My eggs were a bit cold and dry.  But the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

The pancakes on the other hand were Very Good.... 3 big cakes... hot... fluffy... NICE!  And it was served with some really good looking, red and plump strawberries.

Bloody Mary was pretty good.  Better than Republic Kitchen's ... not as good as The Cafe at THEhotel."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile now and can never get enough, absolutely love this place! The service is great, people are friendly, drinks and food are always on point. 

Special mention to Herb, Andre, and Mat!! The owners themselves are awesome as well. 

Friday night is karaoke night, I don't sing but it's so fun to watch!! 

Highly recommend you check this bar out."}
{"text":"Beer selection is ok. Mostly bottle varieties, heavy on the IPAs and stouts. Food was ok. The layout of the furniture leaned more towards bar than grill. Probably go to this place for drinks with friends over dinner. Pool table, darts, and lots of TVs for game watching."}
{"text":"Great service. Same people as used to be at Fado's. So you know the food and staff will be great.
Pity the decor doesn't match the name. It looks like its going to be an English Pub from the name, but is just the old sports bar that closed, with a new name."}
{"text":"They have the best poutine fries I've had outside of canada. With fried cheese curds and onion gravy, it really hits the spot along side a good beer. Their selection of brews is pretty good and is definitely worth exploring. Overall, a nice place to grab a drink and some bites with friends or family."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Great food. Order the patty melt. Great people. Bartenders are amazing and Herp is THE MAN! But don't tell him that lol. They have pool darts and jenga! They have Karaoke on Friday night's which I love! And trivia night on Wednesdays I think. Family friendly bar the only thing is that you can't smoke inside but that's good for you! Definitely recommend. Owner is great as well and visits once in a while! Andre is a really cool dude by the way. And the girls are all amazing especially Sylvia she's very kind."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome pub food! The poutine is awesome and I love shelleys buffalo Mac n cheese. Great happy and great service everytime I've been so far. Wednesday nights are trivia night and my group had SO much fun. I definitely was not made for trivia but it was a great atmosphere and just really great vibes overall. Loved the bartender. They made a great Moscow mule and they have a great beer selection. Definitely a must try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Henderson to grab a beer if you're looking for a casual place with good food to watch a game. I'm not local, but Tanner made me feel like I was. Best bartender I've encountered in awhile. The beer selection is great, and the food is good, too. Definitely will be back....tomorrow."}
{"text":"Friday night is a fun night to come here for karaoke. Great, warm atmosphere. Pool table, darts. TVs all around. It's bright enough to see the the karaoke singers so if you're shy, you can't hide.

Food is okay. The poutine is *NOT* traditional poutine. Instead, it's steak-cut fries smothered in brown gravy with melted cheddar cheese and fried mozzarella sticks. Totally not what I expected when I ordered it off the menu. It tasted fine- like hangover food- but it was NOT the poutine I desired.

The scotch eggs were okay. My Englishman hubby felt the crust was too crispy and thick. 

I'd come back here for the beer and the camaraderie."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but see myself returning a lot. Our bartender, Shelly makes some of the best bloody marys I've had in a long time. The fish and chips was outstanding, best I've had in memory and the hot wings are very good too. There are several items on the menu that I want to try since the fish and the wings were so good. They have big screens on all the wall with sports plus a couple dart boards."}
{"text":"Pub Quizes on Wednesday nights are awesome!  Good fun with good beer!"}
{"text":"Dad and I checked this place out last Monday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised!

It was completely dead since it was about noon on a Monday...we were the only occupants of the restaurant aside from a lone barfly and the guy who took our order.

The decor is pretty cool and makes you feel like you're not necessarily eating at a place set in a strip mall of of Eastern Avenue. It's also quite dark, which is a nice atmospheric touch.

I ended up ordering Ian's Savory Meat Pie and Dad had a bacon cheeseburger. Both of them came with delicious potato wedges, and each entree tasted pretty dang good. The filling of the meat pie consisted of seasoned beef, peas and carrots. It definently warmed me up on a cold day.

I only knock this place because it is a little too expensive for the fare offered and because the service is a bit slow, although extremely friendly. They do have a happy hour with discounted appetizers though and a late night menu which appeared to have some good prices as well."}
{"text":"We had dined here before it was Shakespeare's and thought we would check it out again.  It was busy with a 50th birthday party setup as you came in the door.  We found our own table.  Waiter was friendly and got our drink order.  Instead of a McCallem neat as asked it came on the rocks but he was prompt in correcting the situation

My husband ordered the homemade pot pie and I ordered the Rueben with onion rings being told they were homemade too.  

Food was delivered the chicken pot pie was an inch tall and looked a little soggy.  While it tasted ok my husband said it was more like a frittata minus the eggs.  When we asked the waiter how this could be a pot pie my husband explaining he was English he knows what a pot pie should be  

The waiter said he saw the chef make it in the morning.  He did say the chef was Mexican so it was his interpretation of an English pot pie!   That gave us a good laugh. 

The sandwich was good but the onion rings were out of a bag."}
{"text":"Great English bar! I've been here many times but now it's under new management and it is even better. Go see Lucia and Andre,
 (You couldn't get better service), and try the meatball sliders- they are exceptional.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Gotta update my review to a 4.  I come here often if I'm looking to watch sports or grab a beer and am in the Henderson area.  There really is nowhere better for a pub atmosphere and rotating craft beer selection.  And their prices have actually gone down, where most beers on the menu cap out at $6, even for a usually more expensive double IPA or Belgian (used to be $7 or $8).  And I have failed to find a game that they could not put on the TV.  Nice staff, albeit sometimes tough to flag down for a refill, but they will change the channel for you and are helpful all around.  Great neighborhood bar; I wish they opened up another location in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place. They have a huge selection of beer (draft and otherwise) The boyfriend was in beer heaven. He even got me to try a few. Great bartender, she quickly picked up on the boyfriends adventurous beer ordering, and started offering him different choices and brought him a sample or two. She was good. For food, we started with the Chicken Curry meat pie. I liked lt, and want to go back and try the steak one. Then we split the chicken Tikka Masala and the Sheperd's Pie. Both were pretty good. I love a good Sheperd's pie, but I was kinda stuffed by the time I got to it. The Chicken Tikka Masala was unlike any I've had before but good. I definitely want to try their fish and chips too. I'm sure we'll be back soon. 

Also, This place has a lot of themed nights. Wednesday there's trivia and a comedy something on another night"}
{"text":"Your typical British pub, Shakespeare's offers over 100 different beers, some sort of event going on each night of the week, and decent enough pub food. At a joint like this I did not expect the beer list to be so extensive and I was pleasantly surprised. I have come here a couple of times for lunch and a few times I have come to partake in the Trivia Pub Quiz UYEs.

The food itself is what you would expect from a pub. Good not great, and sometimes you will have to wait a little while for it to come out of the kitchen. I found it quite interesting that their chicken tenders resembled the fish portion of an order of fish n chips, in that the batter used for the protein was identical. The saving grace for me was finding Poutine on the menu, which is a childhood favorite of mine. Can't go wrong with french fries slathered in hot gravy and topped with onions and cheese curds.

{"text":"WoW what a great surprise that we found yesterday. We were looking for a new \"venue\" to watch the football games and decided on Shakespears Grille and Pub in Henderson, Nv.  When I first arrived I sat down and waaited for service which did not come right away I then noticed in the restuarant section of the building there was a soccer team with parents ages about 10 which explained our server being a little tied up. She did come over with a menu and took my drink order which the bartender over heard and began pouring my beer. Once I was joined by my friends our server Debbie came over and could not be more pleasent. As she was tending to other customers and or drinks were running low the bartender noticed this came out from behind the bar to help, great touch. 

The food was really good, one of us had eggs benedict, which I was told was fabulous, the other had shepards pie which he raved about. We split an order of nachos, really good layered perfectly. They had good beer speciaal and two for one bloody mary's, when the first one was finished the bartender noticed and brought over the second one, great service. 

One side note that was mentioned to was that even with about 12 kids playing pool and such the noise was not distracting. We will defintly return again, perhaps we can make into a BRONCOS bar!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Good food, and good wait staff. Jorge has waited on our large group (15+) many times, and always does a fantastic job. The pub has a local feel, and is smoke free-which is always a major bonus in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have never been here but my cousin and her husband are regulars at this place because they live right around the corner from it. They took me here tonight and the waiter Jorge was ridiculously terrible. This review will not be good and because of him I will probably never go back there again, my cousin even said she might stop going there because they had him the last three times and it was just the worst service ever. They ordered their beers and I let the waiter know that I needed a couple of more minutes because they have a really big beer list. He came back roughly 5 minutes later with their beer and as I was midsentence about to order my beer, he stormed off and walked away not even asking if I was ready. He Didn't come back to the table until roughly 5 to 7 minutes later. I ordered my beer and he was out of it so I ordered a different beer that he said he had. He came back to the table with a totally different beer that I didn't ask for. He said he was out of that beer that I asked for as well. What he should've done was come back to the table and ask me what I wanted instead of assuming what he thought I wanted. I ordered my next beer and he came back to the table with the original beer I asked for that he said he was out of in the first place. At this point I was fuming and there was nothing that was going to turn the service around. At the end of the night we asked for our check at three different occasions and still nothing. Oh and did I mention that he handed us everything we ordered instead of putting it down on the table!? Worst service ever and they were out of a lot of stuff!!! Terrible. I forgot to mention his snarky comments that he thought was funny but was actually just rude."}
{"text":"A little difficult to find, it's tucked into a corner in the shopping center on the corner of Eastern and Coronado. Sometimes GPS is just stupid! 
This is a cool bar that has trivia nights on Wednesday. The trivia was so much fun, but the questions were really off. Not what I expected, but had such a great time with about 20 Yelpers.
They offer and ton of beer (which I didnt drink) and a good amount of food offerings. It's a British pub (DUH!) so they have lots of british style food. 
They have a dart board (I think it's free) and an outside area to smoke in.

The service was good, although the waiter stiffed me on a penny. I dont like that! It's my penny, and if I want to leave it for tip, I will. I really didn't care because he was a very good waiter, I'm just mentioning it because of my Duane Reade experience.

I didn't order food, but I tried the curry fries and they were pretty good. Everyone said the food was decent.

I'll definitely be back for another trivia night, it was great. I just wish we knew more answers!

Food OK, service great, prices were good. A-OK to me!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with a friend. I ordered the poutine, which I enjoyed. The atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back, and it's pretty amusing to watch and listen to the people singing karaoke. Very cool, local dive bar."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon like 2PM. Ordered the shepard's pie, which was great...just wish it was a bigger portion. Not the cheapest place to eat, and beers outside of happy hour lighten the wallet."}
{"text":"I have been living in vegas for about six years and this has now become my go to spot after a hards night out of the kitchen.  I love this place. the atmosphere is awesome and their beer selection is on point.  They have the best bartender in vegas hands down.  Kelly is sweet and she makes the best drinks.  Anytime I go out for a drink I always know I will have the best night when i go visit Kelly at Shakespeare's.  I have been bringing some coworkers every few nights and they love it too.  this place is my go to."}
{"text":"Last night the hubby, daughter and I were looking for a new place to try and decided on Shakespeare's. I had heard good things about their so I convinced my husband to give it a try. We were hesitate due to it being a pub and we were worried they would frown upon our little one being in there. But when we walked in we were greeted with a friendly hello and were told we could sit anywhere we liked. The atmosphere was dark and quiet for a Saturday night but we liked that. And it was nice and cool in there which was a relief from the heat. Our waiter Jorge was great. He had a kids menu ready for our daughter and was very friendly to us. My husband ordered the fish and chips, I had the sampler platter, and the little one chicken pot pie. Everything was delicious. The fish had a nice crunch to it which I hear is important to fish and chips. My daughters pot pie was the perfect size for her. It had nice size chicken pieces in it plus it was loaded with veggies which she didn't mind. The sampler platter was just the right amount of bar food that I was looking for. We asked Jorge about their trivia night and he told us it gets pretty busy so to call ahead but that it's a really fun night. So I'm thinking that will be our next adventure to the pub. Thanks again for a great night. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"American and pub fare is really good at Shakespeares. Staff are friendly and helpful and the kitchen staff are super great. Beer selection is good and they have great atmosphere. Good place for a cool night out."}
{"text":"Generally I come here on trivia nights which are a lot of fun. The beer selection is solid and the service here is very good even when they are very busy, if not a tad bit slow.

They run a lot of events and live music which makes it a lot of fun to come here. I met the owner and he was really friendly as well.

The reason I take away one star is that their food is good but not great. Some of their dishes are certainly better than others, but some seem expensive for what they are and it isn't as if the quality is particularly outstanding. Of particular note to me is the sausage rolls which are delicious. However, I had a meat pie and some other things and they were all just average.

The place is really big - maybe too big for its own good when they aren't running an event, but it does really fill up when they have something going on."}
{"text":"With great grief, it saddens me to give Shakespeare's Grille & Pub a 1 star, but I can't forgive a meal that may have been the absolute worst meal of my life.... This rating is 110% due to the food, as I would give the service a 4.5/5 stars. Unfortunately the food was probably the worst of my life (including fast food experiences), even in an intoxicated state where my standards are much lower :(
 
The Chicken Wings (6 wings for $10.99): My girlfriend ate the first couple, and half way into the 2nd one she asked me to smell it. Fortunately we both cook avidly and albeit this meal was a drunk one for me, I still expect fresh food to be cooked. The funky smell on this chicken (overpowering the habanero mango sauce) was an unmistakable sign that the chicken was bad when it was cooked. I (somewhat) understand using food that is on the verge of going bad but this chicken tasted as if it was well into the stages of rotting. 

The Philly Fries: Under cooked fries with dry/tasteless steak that may or may not have been reheated. Atop this was nacho cheese that tasted heated in a can. This meal did not coherently work and the cheese was much too runny for fries or steak. Overall it was not very good.

The Jalapeno Poppers: Best part of the meal. Maybe slightly over cooked but not terrible. Two reasons I say this: 1, the jalapeno could fall right out of the breading, with the breading strongly intact. 2, the cream cheese in the middle stayed extremely hot (burn your mouth hot) well after the outside had entirely cooled, like 15 minutes after they have arrived at the table. 


This post breaks my heart, as Shakespeare's used to be one of my favorite bars to frequent. Unfortunately I have not visited in a couple years and I don't believe I will be visiting again in the future :("}
{"text":"This place has really come along. Jeff is doing wonders here. Haven't found anything on the menu that hasn't been excellent and the Craft Beers are coming weekly now it seems.

The live music has started, on a small scale and will only improve the heads through the door. If/when the Drink Specials follow, this is going to be the Go-To place.

New Diners: Mention Yelp BOGO 1/2 Off Lunch Entree"}
{"text":"Great fish n chips.  The fried pickles are a bit strange because they look like french fries, and they aren't the best I have ever had.  The service is fine when there aren't many people there.  It seems as if it is usually pretty short staffed."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and relax! AMAZING apps!!! Their poitine is the absolute best!!!! If you don't order it you're really messing up!! Wish I lived closer so I could come here everyday!"}
{"text":"We tried Shakespeare's again for the first time in a while and am happy to say that we had a great night.  There was a fun vibe with the crowd at the bar and we ended up chatting with several people that we had never even met before.  Our bartender, Tanner, also had some great recommendations about the menu and what beers would go best with the food we chose. Thank you for a fun evening. We will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Fish and chips would be 5 star if tartar sauce was home made and fries seasoned properly. Tartar sauce tastes store bought. Philly cheese steak meat is dried out and bland. Sandwich  only has meat and cheese no grilled onions or peppers."}
{"text":"Discovered this fantastic pub so close to home! Welcoming staff ( Shelley) and nice owners. Place is undergoing a remodel nightly when they're closed but it's not noticeable. 

Food is really very good. Tried the traditional British breakfast, Scotch eggs and the Poutine fries.  It was all great but we over ordered. Was warned the Poutine fries were enough for a meal but forged ahead and ordered them. Leftovers!  

Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and drink! Also you can watch any football game there and they have individual speakers to listen what game you want! The sausage rolls are awesome and so are the hand rolled chicken fingers. So many beers to choose from and a full bar. Everyone is so friendly there as well! They have something for everyone different nights of the week. Check it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 Star I would. Worst service ever, waiting forever to get a drink order in. Finally we ordered everything. After waiting 25 minutes the waiter brought half of the drink order. We had enough and said we would leave just give us the check for the 2 drinks he did bring. He left again and came back 5 mins later and offered to come the drinks because the food was coming out.

We left."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment and horrible experience.  A packed place and one waiter?  Took 10 minutes for a menu and waited forever for a drink.  Bad experience, never coming back."}
{"text":"Don't bother to come to this place. The food is mediocre and I was overcharged for my sandwich and two drinks by $5 at Happy Hour. I questioned the sandwich and was told by the waitress that the extra $1charge was for fries. The menu clearly states that the order includes choice of fries. And no, she didn't take the $1 off. I didn't notice the overcharge on my drinks until I got home (my bad for not paying attention). I was charged $6/ea for 2 beers which should have been $4/ea at Happy Hour. In addition, the service was lackluster and we were the only table in the place.  Terrible place. Save your money and go somewhere where customers are appreciated and treated well!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service. Awesome selection on beers. Spacious  and comfortable. English nachos were killer!! Good job"}
{"text":"When for lunch with my dad the place was calm, service was good, and the food was tasty. I had the steak and mushroom pie it was savory with good favors."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for trivia and once for karaoke and I really want to go back and just try it on a regular day. The food offerings are excellent--curry chips!--and the alcohol and beer lists are excellent. The bartenders and servers are great, too. This place really feels like a neighborhood joint which we seriously lack in our land of strip malls and stucco.

I have yet to have a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"COMPLETELY SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS!!!
Came here simply to meet with some family and friends .. was greeted by Tanner who was probably the most attentive bartender/server I've ever encountered. Never had an empty drink. Drinks were always on point and the food... oh my lord .. coming to a bar you expect to only eat chicken fingers or food that isn't the healthiest.. Tanner went above and beyond and make sure I stuck to my diet and had me full and happy. On top of that he makes a MEAN MARGARITA AND OLD qFASHION( highly recommended). Thank you for your service tanner! My family and i will definitely be back and bringing more friends and family! 


Cheers"}
{"text":"I go here for Trivia on Wednesdays. It's usually really crowded which makes the trivia atmosphere fun. However, if you go on a Wednesday, be prepared for long service and a somewhat rude server. 

My trivia group has been coming here pretty regularly, but the service hasn't gotten better. We usually get one server whose attitude is supposed to be a fun, laid-back nonchalance but he comes off curt and rude especially when you're hungry/thirsty. 

Food is alright, but there aren't a lot of vegetarian options. I wouldn't eat here without some event going on because the quality doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"Called in an order to go For Shepherds Pie for a friend who was down after surgery.  They said 20 minutes.  I arrived 30 minutes later and it wasn't ready.  After waiting 20 minutes I finally got my order.  So...  It takes 50 minutes to make an order to go??  And they forgot the side of HP sauce!!!  I quit going in here to eat because of lousy service, and the take-out is even worse."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good place to watch a game. Their food is excellent especially the corned beef and cabbage. Beer selection is outstanding and service was very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic local hangout. Stopped by for a late night bite. The bartender was friendly and helpful and got us some info on a local brewery tour. Fish and chips were delicious (not quite as good as England, but pretty damn good for America)."}
{"text":"I get exactly the same thing every time I step thru their doors, Fish & Chips & a Guinness. Why, because it's just done really well here. Fish was cooked to perfection, crispy outside with tender, flaky fish inside. Chips are more like fries, but they serve their purpose. The Guinness is really smooth and at the right temperature to remind you that this is a UK based entrée. 

This business has many theme nights like trivia and sports based, so depending when you go it can get busy or louder than usual, so when I go for dinner I like to time things just right.

This last time I visited they handed us a beer menu. I had not seen this before and once glancing at it I now know I'll be changing my drink selections from time to time, as there were some interesting less vanilla choices available.

If you're a local, there's a coupon that's recently surfaced for a free entrée with a purchased entrée, so use that and enjoy more of their wonderful beer selections.

Thank you guys! See you soon!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Shakespeare's!!  We come here at least once a week....between the great food, service and nice atmosphere it's become one of our regular hangouts!!  Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"This is a nice bar! Great atmosphere, excellent beer selection, and friendly service. All four of us were disappointed in our food, however. We were here on a Friday and our server kept commenting on how busy they were, so that could have been a part of it. two of us had fish and chips, one had lamp sliders, and the fourth had a burger. None of us finished our plates. That being said, we will definitely be coming back for drinks, even if we don't come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Im not sure if this is owned by same owner from the one located in San Diego. 

The food was amazing and huge portions too. 

Our waitress could of been a lil more attentive when it came to refills but other then that it was great.

We would definitely like to try to the place again on our next visit."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner 2 years ago, the food was just ho-hum so never gave it another shot until I had a craving for fish and chips. When I searched through yelp this place came up so we decided to give it another shot. Wow... hubby and I ordered 2 fish and chips and the plate was so huge we could have probably shared one (but probably won't). Hands down one of the best fish and chips in town, better than the fancy gastropubs around the strip, as well. The fish was fluffy and flakey and wasn't swimming in oil. We were very impressed. Our server Andre had a full station and was zipping around the restaurant gracefully, schmoozing with patrons, being all sommelier, host and bus person by himself and didn't seem like in the weeds at all. Will definitely come back, don't know if I'll try other things in the menu but this will be my go-to spot for fish and chips for sure."}
{"text":"We've lived in Henderson for 12 years now and have never found a place we could call \"ours\".  Our place that has great and consistent food, great wait staff and clientele, and close by.  A place we can hang for beers and casual conversation and even play a little on the slots.  A place that has great beer and an ever changing selection on draught.  We finally found it at Shakespeare's!!!!  They have The Walking Dead on the TV on Sunday's!  What can be better!!!"}
{"text":"Best selection of craft beer in the area, both draft and bottled.
Seems like trivia is pretty big here, but on a Friday night the crowd was pretty quiet. And not really a crowd.
The atmosphere inside is more restaurant-y than your typical PT's-type place (which is what we're used to in this area of town...boohoo). Moderately English.
They had a pretty great food menu for happy hour, where everything is $5. Got your standard bar fare like sliders and tacos and some more British-y takes like sausages in puff pastry (which is yummy).
I'm not gonna be a regular or anything, but it's nice to have something in my back pocket for beer in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hit up Shakespeare's after golf one day.  Had a few beers and a great lunch.  Added bonus, a University of Kentucky game was on.  Started with chips and curry then had the Pesto Chicken sandwich with EVEN MORE chips (tater wedges) and curry (spicy brown gravy).  Clearly, I enjoyed the curry, but it came back with a vengeance.  Had the worst indigestion of my life a few hours later.   You know that old saying about curry . . . just kidding.  If there is an old saying about curry, I don't know it.  But seriously, don't overdo it like me.   

I hear they have trivia on Wednesday nights too and the only thing I love more than UK and tater wedges with spicy brown gravy is trivia."}
{"text":"SOLID! 

I tend to frequent the local pub's to watch the English Premier Soccer games, and of course at this moment the World Cup action on daily. I have a thing for atmosphere, with a bunch of random good people whom are fans, eating good food, and watching great soccer...when that goal is scored for your team and throwing the high fives to your neighboring table it just makes the game that much better. 

I wanted to switch it up from my regular Crown & Anchor routine and being near Eastern and Anthem area anyway it made sense to look at Yelp to direct me here. It was a smaller attention game Japan v Columbia so arriving half hour before the game left the couch and comfortable chairs in front of the drop down open and was the ideal place to enjoy the game. If its a higher profile game i would recommend getting there early for a spot as i can tell that this place could be popular with 2 drop down screens and projectors and plenty of space to roam during the game. My server was Shelly, what a sweetheart! Pretty much made my afternoon with her attitude and service. I had the Fish tacos, and my partner in crime for the day enjoyed the Fish & Chips...fish batter is on point and crispy, although i like thinner crispy fries rather than wedge the wedges were still very tasty. Pretty much ties the best meal i've had during a game with Twin Peaks where i also had fish tacos. We also shared a dessert, a warm brownie with ice cream on top that was pretty tasty and finished out my meal perfectly. 

If your looking for a place to watch the game, and grab a good bite Shakespeare's delivers. Do check it out. 

Tomorrow is Germany v USA, and i know where ill be."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... fish and chips are a must!!!! Great place for any sporting event!"}
{"text":"Where can you go in Henderson for good drinks and a good crowd past midnight? I thought the answer was NOWHERE until I found Shakespeare's! I finished a gig with my band one night around midnight on a Saturday, and thought \"oh great, I'm hungry again and there's no place that I like on my way home. I'll probably eat at Roberto's again.\" But a friend that lives in Henderson took us here and I was pleasantly surprised. Decent food - I had the steak sandwich, decent selection of beers. But even better was the atmosphere - karaoke night and everyone was having a good time. It's not my top choice in town or anything, but I challenge you to find a better bar on the east side that serves food after midnight and actually has more than 5 people hanging out on a weekend. It's really a 3 star joint, but in a 2 star neighborhood it gets the bonus star for standing out."}
{"text":"I've been into trying beers as of late, but as much as I want to support places like this, I wasn't happy enough with the food.

Shakespeare's Grille & Pub is an English-styled bar just over the Henderson border of Eastern Ave. They're a sports bar - specifically a Steelers bar, if you're into that kind of thing - and were airing NFL games on the big projector and several smaller TVs on the penultimate Sunday of the playoffs. And if you're into craft beers, they have a handful available both on draft and on tap. Perhaps try a particular popular third-party beer-centric app and you could see that they regularly update their menu online in a timely manner.

I had a late \"lunch\" here with Michael K. He suggested that the Guinness draft ($5) was a good option here. so I started with one pint. It's about the same as I faintly recalled from the other time I'd had this (funny enough, also on an afternoon with Michael). The beer isn't too bitter, but the creamy. even silky texture is what would convince me to try it again.

I opted for something different for pint #2, an Oskar Blues Brewery draft called Hotbox Coffee Porter ($7). It's about as dark as the Guinness, but the ubiquitous coffee flavor of porters is in full effect with this craft beer. It's about as good as I've had in a \"basic\" porter.

Happy hour specials are available daily from 3 to 6 pm and from midnight to 2 am. We happened to visit during happy hour, so we ordered a plethora of $5 food options:

- Potato Skins: not very crispy or seasoned, perhaps relying on the bacon for flavor a bit too much
- Sausage rolls: underwhelming, with the \"bangers\" tasting like simple (allbeit satisfying) bratwurst and the pastry shell ending up more greasy than flaky. However, the horseradish mustard aioli was addictive and found its way into other dishes.
- Chips, Salsa & Whiz: simple, crunchy, prefab tortilla chips with a mild chipotle salsa and some liquid cheese product. Tasty, but the culinary effort is minimal.

Also, I had to check out the Poutine Fries ($8.99), which were perhaps a more competent take on the dish than some other local efforts. I still missed having crispiness on the steak fries, but the gravy and cheddar were plentiful, and the breaded/fried cheese curds were satisfying. I do wish that the cheese curbs were sized and dispersed more evenly, but I could see myself ordering this again barring a better local alternative (interestingly, Michael has already provided such a recommendation).

The game volume wasn't so loud that I couldn't have a conversation. The lighting was lackluster at most seats aside from the cozy booth which we'd located not far from the bar. Other patrons only got loud once or twice during the course of the football action.

I just don't see myself coming back to Shakespeare's for the food, and the beer variety is better than some places but not up to snuff with the real craft beer hotspots around town. It's a very solid neighborhood watering hole but not a destination."}
{"text":"Cool and dim inside....
The Creamy Vegetable soup- Hellah Good!!!! I would go there just for this soup, I wish the bowl was bigger.... For $5.00 it should be bigger!!!
The BF had Fish and Chips and it was pretty good, the big problem though was that the breading on the fish kept falling off- Dip one fish stick in the tarter sauce and all your crunchy breading is still in the sauce- That sucked...
I had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich- Pretty good too, I loved that they had potato wedges for fries- YAY!!!
I wish there were more food selections in the menu though...
We do plan on going back and actually trying their English Selections.
 
FYI if your name is Ursula like mine - the bartender's name is Ursula also so you will be hearing your name all through your meal- whether it's her introducing herself to customers or people calling her- It never failed everytime I heard \"URSULA\" I looked up even though I knew it wasn't me-Maybe one night all of us URSULA'S should go there and really cause some confusing sh** huh?"}
{"text":"The customer service is really bad. Added items on my check that I never ordered. Why have a great patio when you don't offer a waiter to serve out there? I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my goals when I moved  to Las Vegas, close to 2 years ago now, was to find new places to venture to. To find great local places to call home and frequent  when I just didn't want to sit inside the house all night.  And when I find one I absolutely adore I just want to help out and promote the hell out of the establishment.

Shakespeare's Pub & Grill is one I feel deserves that type of promotion!

The first time I walked in the pub I thought I was definitely going to like it here.  First, It is a LOT bigger then it looks from the outside and since they added outdoor seating even more people can get the fantastic food they provide.  The pool table to the right and the dart board towards the back was my first indication and first good visual, as I scanned the entire place that this was definitely a true Pub.  As I walked up to the bar I heard the Jukebox playing 80's style music and instantly fell in love.  

The bartender at the time was awesome!  We talked all about the opening of the place and the history of the owner (who by the way is a great guy and has an excellent Scottish accent) And since then each bartender I've talked to has been equally fun and interesting.

The food!  Well I've only been back 6 times and can't stop from ordering the Guinness wings which are exceptionally tasty.  I've also had the Pear and Blue Cheese Salad (I couldn't keep my fork from diving for more) Every bite was equally great. Another time I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomatoes and rolled my eyes back with happiness, it was just a simple lunch.  

One of these days I will be able to have everything on the menu, but that is the fun of going back to a favorite spot.  

So go check out the Shakespeare's Pub.  Show a little love to a local Vegas place off the strip and enjoy the food and Pub experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink! Their Bangers & Mash was amazing! Bangers were big portioned and their Mash was really good. I love the fact that they have a good amount of TVs and a large projector with all of them displaying sports. The only thing that bothered me were the sticky/dirty tables and seats. Even though the surroundings and food were great, I did not feel clean and comfortable at all. Not sure if that's how the feel of the restaurant was supposed to be? But it could've been much more cleaner."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with my friends! The food was GREAT and large portions. Megan our server was amazing!! If you haven't been you need to go!!!"}
{"text":"We had a group of friends meet at this adorable English themed bar for a going away party. What an awesome hidden gem! Great music, great food, impressive craft beer selection, outdoor seating avail, pool tables, darts, and trivia, and tons of tvs everywhere to keep you entertained. This is a pretty big place and perfect for larger groups. Our server Jorge (sp?) was on it! By the end of the evening our friendly, fun and attentive server felt like a part of our group. The bartenders were also super nice. Shakespears was a refreshing departure from some of the more popular bars here in Henderson that constantly fall short in terms of service. Love it and will definitely return"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to go watch football. They have a ton of TVs and usually some good bucket specials. 

I've been meaning to go to one of their Tap Takeover events, which sound fun. Lots of great beer on tap and in bottles. Not just a place to get a cold domestic lager -- although you certainly can. 

I've ate here a couple of times. Good bad food, but some of the specials are pretty bland. I got brisket once and that was a mistake. The old lady's mac and cheese was very good. 

Will have to hit one of the beer events. Thinking that will take my opinion up a notch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a challenging Trivia spot, this is it. Out of all of the trivia spots in the city that I've been to, this was the one that really stumped our group. The age ranges from young 21 year olds all the way to the early baby boomers. The questions were a good mix to be fair for both extremes in age groups. Definitely a lot more history/former celebrities than pop culture. Perfect spot to bring your older parents! 
The happy hour is nothing special. It ends an hour before trivia night, but I wouldn't bother showing up early to get it. They have a special on trivia nights for 4$ all night, just stick to that, forget the happy hour. 
The loaded fries with steak were VERY filling. Cheap and definitely 2+ peoples worth. The beer was beer."}
{"text":"So super underrated little pub.  I actually think that I may have had the best salad i've had in the valley right in this pub!  It was a pear and orange salad.  But what really sold me on it were the candied pecans.  mmmm so worth the carb cutting!  It was absolutley dead the night I went becuase it was a weekday night and we were just driving by looking in.  The staff were super friendly and great.  The star was lost in that we weren't really greeted when we walked in the door.  There was a reception desk and I waited near it to be seated but no one came to do so.  So naturally we just wandered in and sat closer to the bar where we'd be visible and from that point on they were very accomodating.  Great giant screens and totally an irish pub to check out for St. Patty's day if ur trying to avoid the strip!  They said they are taking over part of the parking lot and hiring a band and i'm sure the festivities will be full of merriment!"}
{"text":"best fish and chips in vegas, we were alone but service was great.My only problem was it smelled like an old casino fix that and you get 5 stars.I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sat. night and it was someones 50th b-day! DJ pumpin and a packed celebratory house. 

About 26 special beers on tap and even more bottled beers.

The corned beef platter comes with shredded cabbage and cubed potatoes. Soft meat and served with a mustardy sauce on the side.

The savory meat pie was crazy good because of the amount of stew meat and the flaky, buttery heaven of a thick but light crust like a croissant, haha, but not. Maybe a croissants older brother on steroids. I digress.

Easy parking, great service and an eclectic selection of menu items. Want to try the chili and also the lamb sliders. Oh, still gotta try the fish n chips. It was a party here this night."}
{"text":"This place serves long islands that taste like watered down coke. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Did not feel like a pub at all.  Food was ok as was service.  I don't feel compelled to come back, to me this place was very average."}
{"text":"My home away from home. The new owners have done a great job cleaning up the place. My day would not be complete without seeing Shelly and Jaime.  And rock and roll bingo on Sunday with the family is great."}
{"text":"I LOVE good fish and chips and I SO wanted to like their's as they say its the best in town,...I thinks not.  I admit I did have a two for one coupon so we thought we'd give it a try.  We anxiously ordered the F&C's.  It looked good on the plate, large portions however they were both soaked in bad tasting grease as were the chips.  I was so disappointed as I had not eaten anything all day and was starved by the time I got there. But even with my iron stomach grumbling I couldn't eat it. And believe me, I can eat anything.  I know a few things about the restaurant business and cooking. First off I could tell the fry oil had not been changed in a while and they too may have been cooked at a a too low temperature which allows the fat to soak in the batter.  Also they were totally tasteless. I mean TOTALLY. I had to drench them in vinegar and leaned heavy on the tarter sauce to try to mask the bad oily flavor but they were just too permeated with grease to eat.  I politely told the waitress that they should change the fry oil and she told me they just did.  Believe me they did not.  Also I realize I was using a two for one coupon but she still should have offered to make it a better experience somehow. She did not. Also we asked to play a round of darts while waiting and all of the darts given to us were pretty much all broken.  Not good for a place that like to brag about being a traditional Brittish pub.When I got home we were sick to the stomach from the few bites we did eat. I'm considering calling them up today and asking for a refund minus the tip. I really don't want to go back for a \"make up meal\".  I'm hoping the owner reads this and realizes I don't mean to bash them, just draw attention to some major shortcomings. I hope he fixes them as I'd like nothing more than this local business to thrive.. Despite the 2 for 1, the bill still came to about $30 including tip (which I always base on the amount before any discount.)  I really hope they step up their game."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Fish n chips melt in your mouths. Wonderful fries n cole slaw. This is a must go to place u cannot go wrong"}
{"text":"I followed Shannon the bartender from her previous job because she always gave me great service and when she mentioned they have tons of craft beer, of course I was going to go check it out as I love IPA, Imperial IPAs and so on. I can't say enough on how awesome this place is. There is no smoking which automatically rates it a 5 star, and Cory as well as Justin are great owners. They take time to hear suggestions for different booze and take care of their dart boards which I love. They were some crappy Coors Light boards but they upgraded to DMI Bandits which are staple free. I'm hoping they start some sort of dart league or tournament in the near future to take part in. They have the newest Golden Tee which is also a great addition. The next best thing would be a Power Putt LIVE machine, then I'd live at this bar!

Anyway, go check this place out but for the best bartender in town go see Shannon on Monday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday night! She may occasionally have others but it's a toss up.

{"text":"Omg! The beer. The food. The service! Everything was excellent!!! 1 page of draft beers and 5 pages of bottled beer. Enjoyed the English nachos, fish and chips, and a rueben...all of it was fresh, hot, and incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious beer!  Yum!  A cool spot, spacious and clean often with live music or trivia games.  My wife and I would call this our favorite neighborhood pub because it's super close and always good.  Waitress Angel is always so nice and everyone else we have encountered has been friendly as well.  The food is good, but not amazing, although my wife loves the fish and chips.  The real English mustard is great, though, and there is darts and billiards.  A really great bar!"}

{"text":"Loved the FOOD!
This place has great food and good beers on tap, happy hour is ok with cheap tacos ($2 I think) and cheaper beers.  Ambiance is cool with the Shakespeare theme/sports bar.  I especially liked the games you can play (jenga, checkers, backgammon etc) while you wait or watch the game.  Overall I really liked it, it is a bit more expensive than some sports bars but the quality of the food and maybe a coupon/cert make up for it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time! We were really impressed by the amazing service and the quality of the food! Awesome Ruben sandwich and the Caribbean salad had better and more fresh ingredients that most restaurants. Great atmosphere- very fun and good vibes all around. Awesome selection of beers as well. I also love the no smoking ."}
{"text":"Great location in Henderson. Has two steel tip dartboards :-)) 10 TV's of which 2 are big-screens. Pool table. Food was very good with hardy portions. Mega beer selection (they have a 9 page drink menu). Barmaids courteous and good looking. Defiantly good for large parties. Can't think of anything negative to post? I will for sure be returning in the future and telling my friends about  Shakespeare's."}
{"text":"First (and foremost), make sure you check in when you visit. They offer a free pitcher of beer to anyone who checks in, which is a much better promo that any other place I've been to.

This is an AWESOME little grill and pub.  The food is good, the drinks are strong, they have a ton of drink options (all reasonably priced, too), and the atmosphere is perfect.  I love pubs because you can enjoy an evening with friends without having to scream at each other to have a conversation.   

Shakespeare's is great because it has something for everyone.  Inside, there's music/ karaoke, tables, and booths.  Outside, there's a great fenced off area.  While we were there, people were playing beer pong outside.

Everyone that worked there was very friendly.  They were really quick to fill our orders, and were great about clearing tables and asking if we wanted another round.  It was really busy because it was Halloween, but you still felt like you were getting premium service.

We will definitely be back!"}

Make sure you check out the new Shakespeare's and ask for Lucia- you won't be disappointed!"}

{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is GREAT...lots of tv's around and also a huge projection screen always showing the games...Tiffini the bartender is the BEST, her alcohol knowledge is amazing, she can make anything you ask or at least suggest something similar to your liking if not better, always see the owner Cory making his rounds of the place and greeting the guests, there's always something going on each night, including trivia & karaoke!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place via a friend who works in the food/beverage industry. 
The food:  They have happy hour 7 days a week. My favorite happy hour item is the chicken tenders. Or the chips and curry. However, my favorite overall is the chicken curry meat pie. OMG, the curry. I crave it daily. Sooooo good. Fish and chips are great as well. My husband really likes the sliders and the Caribbean chicken salad. During football games they have $15 buckets of sliders/wings/tenders with fries. My inner fat kid is always happy on game days. 
Staff:  I love the staff. My drink glass never gets empty. I can come here, tell the bartender \"I like rum and fruity drinks\" and they can whip up something delicious and strong. YUM. The owner is often around, mingling with the rest of us and asking how things are going. He is a true beer aficionado. I have seen him sit with my husband for 15 minutes talking beer. He always asks for recommendations on what we would like to see on tap, and my husband likes to think that's why the 90 min Dogfish IPA is on tap (lol, his personal fav). 
Gaming:  The machines here are gold pass poker machines. I enjoy them. Never struck it rich but I usually walk out even. They just got 2 brand new dart boards which is where we spend most of our time. 
Entertainment:  They have quiz trivia, comedy nights, and live music events. I like coming here on Sundays and relaxing on their couches to watch the games. They also have a pool table and Golden Tee, neither of which I've used. 
I'm here for the food, the strong drinks, and the service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"English American pub not bad breakfast better than expected.  Decor is nice the Pub is clean and no smell. Seems like it would be a nice place to hang out if you are looking call home away from home."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, and karaoke! You can't go wrong with that combo for a Friday night. I am NOT a poutine fan, but some people in our group wanted to try it, so we ordered the poutine. I will admit that their poutine is actually good. And this is coming from someone who hates gravy!

If you are here during karaoke, please stick around. People were singing very eclectic songs (from The Rolling Stones to the Beach Boys to Def Leppard) but they were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks for a bar and grill. $8 wine?! Poor service...didn't bring water when asked, barely visited our table. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, however a bit pricey for a Pub. Have been several times now, haven't had anything I wouldn't gladly order again."}
{"text":"This place was dead when we went on a Friday around 4 o'clock but the happy hour was pretty good.  $2 light beers and a $1 off other drafts.  There are a few food specials for $2 as well and on Monday and Friday the happy hour starts at 2 o'clock.  The restaurant/bar are pretty big and there are both high and low tables to sit at.  The waitress was on top of it and was always quick to refill our drinks.  They have a lot of English/Irish beers on tap and even a few craft beers like Lagunitas and Stone.  If you want a good happy hour and a quiet place to hang out, this might just be the place."}
{"text":"Out in Henderson for the Ironman 70.3, came across this place on yelp, was not disappointed. The poutine was delicious. I had the fish & chips, HUGE portion, others had shepherds pie, Philly cheesesteak & salmon club. Everyone said their food was great. Quick friendly service, I'd come back :)"}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and they had multiple TVs playing sports and a Dj playing Frank Sinatra? It was quite interesting. The music did get livelier after an hour or so. They've got darts and pool. Walked up to the bar and asked Andre the bartender what IPAs they had. He was friendly and helpful. I picked Stone as my nightcap. I didn't order any food but it sure did smell good."}
{"text":"One of the best little pubs in the area. I usually come for a pint or two with my girlfriend after a long day. Really amazing selection for drinks here, and the food is definitely worth coming back for. Each night something good is happening here, my favorite day is Wensday, which is quiz night ( I've won a few times and have gotten great beer related prizes)."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place.  To begin with, I didn't like the beer selection which was mainly infusion type beers.  In my opinion, a good hefeweizen should not have blueberries in it!  Also the food wasn't very good.  Our lamb chops were over cooked and did not have much flavor, and the brown gravy for the mash potatoes was too salty.  In addition, it took a long time for us to get our food after the waiter took our order.  So obviously I will not be a repeat customer.

UPDATE: The owner or manager has recently informed me that this pub has over 200 beers.  It would have been nice if my server had told me that; all he did is hand me a beer menu with far fewer than 200 selections.  So I guess poor training/management of employees is another reason to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Menu mid-afternoon seemed very limited; quality of fish & chips was poor. Very greasy, mushy fish and thoroughly lacking in flavor!"}
{"text":"Went here with my folks. Fantastic fish and chips. Mom had the lamb chops yum. Dan had meatball sub with sweet potato fries. 

Great beer selection. We shared a Belchnig Beaver Peanut Butter stout. Wow!!! Amazing flavor!!  Mom had the cider very refreshing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The beers are amazing. Our server, Sarah, was incredible! She was the best. Got the chicken tenders and they were honestly the best tenders I've had. Stop by for some amazing food and drinks, and ask for Sarah. She's amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Check in on yelp and you get 50% your second entree you order!

This place is a casual pub/ bar located right next to sushi wa on Coronado and Eastern. I cannot really rate the beers since I was here for lunch and it was too early to drink. I ordered the fish n chips  which consisted of two large pieces of battered fish and coleslaw and potato wedges. I was very impressed how the fish was battered and fried to perfection. The fish itself was crunchy and not soggy. The potato wedges and coleslaw was delicious as well. The service was great, she was very pleasant and had a great personality. She did not forget about me even though i was sitting outside enjoying the beautiful weather. 

Overall I had a great experience with this place, I definitely  will go back to dine in the evening and to try out the beers. This looks like a great place to relax and chill with friends."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town by far!  Relaxing atmosphere. Great friendly service. My husband loves there large beer selection."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to get take out because I was staying across the street at the Hilton. I really liked the atmosphere here, kind of a generic British Isles theme with a variety of paeans to the Bard, obviously. The service was friendly and fast. There were probably a dozen patrons on the Wednesday evening I was there. They seemed to have a solid English pub menu; I'd like to have tried more. What I did try was the pear and blue cheese salad with grilled chicken (added at the waiter's suggestion), and it was great. Wish I'd had time to tip back a few cold ones and hang out here a while."}
{"text":"Glad to know there is a place that serves decent fish and chips in this town. We found them based off of other Yelp reviews...Thank you for that! The food is good hearty and full of flavor, it maybe not be as authentic as most pubs by way of atmosphere, but they deliver on quality of food and service, The chips are excellent the beer cold and yes the Guiness on tap is like an \"old friend\" in a glass. Try it if you crave pub comfort food or just want to chill in a friendly neighborhood place, for some beer and pool."}
{"text":"Again, fish and chips did not deliver, fish was small, and only two sticks, with too many fries to compensate. Not worth 15 dollars."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Fish and Chips place  to go! Always consistent and never greasy! Five Stars for you !! I love your Fish and Chips! I've been to London and they don't compare to yours at all!!  I don't even know what your other items are in the menu because your Fish and Chips are Great!!"}
{"text":"So the food is inconsistent,  the service is pretty bad because they never have enough people working, but the drinks are good and the atmosphere is great.   Its one of those neighborhood bars that you'll come back to over and over because everything is really chill and laid back.

I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but can't..."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love that it is non-smoking! They have great food and the bartenders are very nice and take good care of the customers. It's a great place to watch games. They have darts and a pool table as well as an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Great hangout great beer options food is great as well... pool tables and dart boards.. Fun place to tie one on... It if Friday night and they are doing karaoke funny people watching!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. It's a nice low-key atmosphere, and the food is fantastic. I usually get the fish in chips, but I've tried most things on the menu and haven't found something that's not really good yet. I can also attest to the battered chicken tenders appetizers. 

Service is really great as well. Casual and friendly. 

Side note, and not really the fault of the establishment. I was eating there once when some strange woman who was eating with her friend next to us wondered over to our table and starting asking questions about our meals. We assured her it was good. At this time she took out her phone and started taking pictures of our plates. She finally noticed the WTF look on our faces. She then told us, in an official sounding tone usually reserved for fire marshals, that it's ok because she was a \"foodie\". Very odd."}
{"text":"A group of us met for dinner & shared 6 different items...they were all Uh-May-Zing!!! I'm so sad I live in a different state & can't go back all the time!! The Tikka Misala & Fish & Chips (wedges) made my mouth happy to be alive! Even the Chicken fingers were fantastic. Great job guys...looking forward to our next trip to Vegas so we can meet there again. We asked for tons of sides, refills, special requests &  our server took them all in stride; great service...Cudos Jorge!! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"There's nothing that disappoints me more than high hopes for a place being shattered by poor service, and bland food. 

My first review of Shakespeare's expressed my extreme disappointment, about 4 months ago. 
A day or two after the review was posted, I received a private message from the management team, sincerely apologizing for the bad experience, and letting me know that the website had been updated to correct the issue that caused a good part of the snafu last time.

We had considered coming back out to try Shakespeare's again, because lets face it: many business owners could have (and would have) responded in a much more negative way.  Shakespeare's however, took it as constructive criticism, and wanted to make it right.  That kind of attitude goes a long way with me.  The only problem was, that its SO far from where we live!

Well, last night, we found ourselves heading to Shakespeare's for the \"Watching Dead\" viewing party.  

Let me tell you, the experience was NIGHT AND DAY. 

We were greeted warmly by the manager, and by our server.  We were checked on frequently.  I observed the other servers, and they all seemed to be interacting positively with a very packed house.   

Shall we talk about how amazing the food was this time?  
We had:

Honey Sriracha wings:  Delicious.  Tender.  Spicy.  Sweet.  Excellent cook.
Beer Battered Chicken Tenders:  wow!  The breading was incredible.  Tender Juicy chicken, and not super greasy, like other places. 
Fries/Chips with curry sauce:  really really really nice!  I love a good curry dipping sauce, and this was great. 
Angus Beef Sliders: Beef was really well seasoned, and well cooked. 
Beef and Veggie Meat Pie:  A revelation.  My absolute favorite dish of the night. Fella and I were splitting it, and I almost didn't let him have any!
Sausage Roll: Fella wasn't a fan (he doesn't usually care for meat in a pastry), but I devoured it.  The sausage was great!
Jorge's Pub Mac n Cheese:  Second favorite of the night.  I'm a mac n cheese elitist.  I don't like things in my mac n cheese, and I'm REALLY picky about it.  This.  Was.  Phenomenal.  I will be back JUST for this dish.  Creamy mac n cheese, crispy bacon, and jalapenos (which I avoided eating whole, since I don't like a lot of spice, but the flavor of the dish...oh my goodness, this is a winner!)
Jalapeno Turkey Burger: This I didn't try, as there is avocado on it, and I'm allergic, but Fella ate it, and just raved!  It was his favorite of the night, right up there with the meat pie and the mac n cheese.   He said it was seasoned really really well, and was tender and delicious. 

I'm really glad that we gave Shakespeare's another chance.  Sometimes, places just have a really off day, and it seems that this was the case here.  

Thank you again, Shakespeare's, for the great service last night, and the amazing food.  We'll be coming back again, soon."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips and tartar sauce ever!  Bangers and Mash and Shepherd's Pie are great as well... and Smithwick's is on tap.  The only reason I didn't rate this at 5 stars is the slow service.  Just have some patience when you go here and you'll enjoy the food tremendously.  We've never had a bad experience at Shakespeare's."}
{"text":"Upon entry, our eyes needed a moment to readjust from the glaring midday sun to the dimly lit interior of the pub. After stumbling about for a bit, my husband and I settled in a booth next to the bar. A friendly waitress greeted us quickly to hand us a few menus and take our drink orders. With a request for a good IPA, she returned with no less than three tasters in hand. Impressive! Lunch was off to a great start (especially with Whitesnake playing on the jukebox!).    

GRILLED CHEESE ($6.99): I went with wheat bread and steak fries as my side. A simple rendition of the classic but perfect for the price-point. 4/5

THE RACHEL ($11.99): Husband described the size of this turkey ruben sandwich as \"ridiculous\". He could only eat half. He went with sweet potato fries as his side. 4/5

The waitress at Shakespeare's was awesome and the grub was good. My only gripe was that there was a noticeable lack of vegetarian options on the menu. A veggie burger option would be amazing. A girl can dream, after all.

{"text":"Nice restaurant. Don't get me wrong. The food was good. And would have been better had my burger be cooked medium well like I ask. And had I been given steak fries instead of skinny fries. I was going to move to the bar and gamble while I waited on my husband to smoke. But unfortunately she didn't return with the to go box until he was done smoking. And it would be nice if the tables were actually under a light. Had to move my table so I could see my food. Beer was cold if not expensive. $4 for a domestic $6 for an import. And the menus could have used a wipe down.  And the poor lady behind the bar could have used help."}
{"text":"We're looking for a new bar close to our house. So far we haven't found a winner. We came here when we at last minute had a babysitter. This place was a very good first experience. We got apps and salad, and both were very good. We came here, mostly because I love hanging out with my husband, but I prefer to be doing something while at a bar. This bar had several options. Darts, pool, and we even saw a large jenga set. 

The reason this is probably going to be our new go-to local place, is that there is no smoking! Most bars get around that by walling off the food area from the smokey bar. Yuck. It was so refreshing to be at a place and not go home stinking (we've previously live in Chicago and NH so we are not used to smoking in bars anymore). 

Also, the night we were there someone was celebrating something, and they had hired the karaoke dj to play. It was fun watching that, and anyone could go up there. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Similar batter for fish as your chicken tenders? Why, yes, please. I like that their batter is thinner than most places, comes out crisp, and keeps the chicken moist. My friend and I had came here after lounging around Crepe Shack for a few hours. Dessert before dinner had landed us right outside of the happy hour window. Come before 7pm on the weekdays and the appetizers are a couple dollars cheaper. The serving sizes are smaller, so the deals did not look that appealing. There are definitely better deals out there. 

The whole Great Britain area does know how to produce good fried items. The chips are also delicious. Big wedges, sprinkled with parsley goes well with a splash of vinegar. Our pints of Guinness and a Snake Bite are reasonable at $6 each. Some of the drinks are on the crazy expensive price. Even the Irish bars on the Strip do not charge some of these prices. 

For $26, we got two drinks, chicken fingers, and chips. Not bad since we could not finish off all of it. It is just a lot of heavy food. 

I liked how honest the bartenders were. When we asked about the menu he rattled off about how some of the items are skimpy and which are the best. I appreciated the honesty."}
{"text":"Awesome Philly Cheese Steak!  We love this bar... great company, drinks, and delicious food! Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"We came here looking for a local pub/bar that had craft beer and we found a fun little local place!

It's too bad we'd just missed their 7pm trivia on Wednesdays and Tuesdays (we came around 9pm) but we heard that it's a super fun time and WILL be back!

There's even a winner's circle table for the winners that has its very own beer tap in the middle!

We tried out the scotch egg (a favorite of ours) and also their Honey Sriracha wings which were very crunchy and delish. For beer, we shared the Rogue Brewery Lemon Chiffon Cruller and also each had a second beer (sorry not sorry) - I had a Hawaiian wheat and hubby had a Hefe - both were delicious.

I am not a girl who digs domestic beer - I can grab that at the grocery store if I really had a hankering - I love to treat beer like I do food and experience local flavors and small brewery tastes so this was a welcome find and treat!"}
{"text":"This place can suck it! If you don't want to make food to go, take your asses off Postmates and quit accepting orders and then canceling them 15-minutes later. You guys are clowns that can't seem to figure out how to run a food business."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Will have to visit friends again so we can head back. Great pub food, good Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here before and been pleased with the food, although the service has been slow. This evening, however, we walked out after sitting for nearly ten minutes without so much as an acknowledgement from a server. Even a simple wave as indication that we'd been noticed would have been an improvement.

The food is good, but I can get good food at any number of places in town. The service here is just not good enough for me to recommend them to anyone else."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the phenomenal food, this would have been an easy one star. Apparently, it is a huge burden to exercise courtesy here. The bartender with the half shaved head acted as if I was really putting her out when I asked her if we could sit anywhere...I waited patiently to ask her while she was having a conversation with a guy that lasted 5 minutes or so. We just stood there waiting for her to finish her story so she could acknowledge us...finally she looks at me and says what do no need? just the beginning...waiter shows up after 10 mins, hands us two menus and instantly asks if we know what we want. We give him our drink orders, and ask him to give us a couple minutes to look at the menu. He does, we order, food comes up pretty quickly...dude drops our food off, and never came back...I tried flagging him down with head nods, hand gestures, smoke signals, etc., and even had the opportunity to say excuse me sir once when he was at the table next to us taking an order, but he ignored us. He showed back up to drop off a check, at which point I was irritated, and asked if he had forgotten about us. He laughed and said no. I didn't laugh and said that I haven't seen you since you dropped our food off. It was delicious, but I needed a side of gravy, and refills about a half hour ago...to this he said nothing. Literally just stood there with a look. Finally, he says do you want a refill, to which I reply yes! I've been thirsty for 30 minutes. Honestly, I haven't decided if I'm going back or not."}
{"text":"Best place ever they are always great with events. Love the karaoke night! Love the staff! Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely awful. We came in for trivia about 4 or 5 times, and tonight was our last straw with this place. We've had two different waiters/waitresses, and they all have the same stupid attitude (\"Can we have menus please?\" \"maaaaybe\"). This wouldn't be so bad except every time they forget the menus! 
The food itself is pretty decent for bar food, if you can convince your waiter to take your order - and assuming they remember the order. Every time we've been here, they've either gotten someone's order wrong (I realize this could be a mixup in the kitchen too, but still), or they just blatantly forget to bring something. 

A few examples of what this establishment apparently considers \"service\":
One of our servers was just blatantly rude - someone at our table ordered a drink (\"could I get a vodka cranberry please?\") and he responded with \"No\" and walked away. I get it, you're supposed to be the cool, laid back server that will joke with us - but that only works if you actually do your job. He never brought the drink, even after being reminded once. On a separate night, he brought out the wrong order (someone ordered chicken tenders, he brought chicken nachos). Instead of apologizing and taking the order back to be replaced, he put the nachos down in front of her, said \"I SWEAR I heard nachos\", and walked away.
Our waitress tonight took 15 minutes to bring us menus (she was chatting - not busy with other customers). She tried pulling off the 'adorable girl' attitude on us, which again may have worked if she did her job. We never got drink menus, waiting another 10-15 minutes to order food, and even then the orders were messed up.

This is literally the only place I have ever gone and not left a tip. My entire group are good tippers, and even with poor service tip at least 15% (and that takes pretty poor service for us to leave that little). After leaving the bare minimum the last few times, tonight was the last straw - for the first time in our lives, we left $0 tip. That's how awful the service is here.

I like the food, I love the trivia, but I will never be coming back here. Spend your money somewhere where there's good service - or hell, even poor service is better than this place."}
{"text":"I came here in search of some English cuisine, which this establishment doesn't have much of. There were just a handful of \"English favorites\" and the rest of the menu was your typical pub food. All that being said everything down to the service was phenomenal! I had the Reuben which came piled HIGH with some of the best corned beef and delicious thick slices of rye. We also had fried pickles which were awesome. The fish and chips came with two GIANT pieces of cod and my wife's grilled cheese was also solid. Besides all of that the one thing I will make sure to note due to its importance is that the steak fries were cooked to perfection! Just slightly crispy on the outside and perfect in the middle. The only other thing I can complain about was that we got there later in the evening(9pm) and the music was really loud, luckily they had outdoor seating which was really nice so we could enjoy our last meal before we head back to Boise tomorrow morning. I would eat here again given the opportunity, and I think you should as well!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Shakespeare's - they have a great vibe and awesome beer selection. So why only 3 stars? I was in there recently and left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth because whoever was in charge kept skipping all of the songs on the jukebox that he didn't play. Not that each song is so expensive, but it's still MY money and it's a jerky thing to do.

Other than that - this place is pretty great. On Sunday nights they host a cool music/trivia/bingo event that I would definitely suggest checking out. The food is good and there is a pool table as well. They recently remodeled a bit and there are now large booths and lots of seating, along with the huge bar."}
{"text":"The service we received was excellent, Shelley was very friendly & helpful.

The pub itself was just looking a bit old/tired.

We came here to watch the World Cup semi final and they do have plenty of screens (although the projectors are not as bright/sharp as would be ideal).

The food just wasn't very good/authentic at all.

The bacon in the \"Full English Breakfast\" is american style (I didn't order it, but was disappointed to hear that).

I had the sausage rolls which were very \"heavy/stodgy\" the meat had next to no flavor and perhaps the pastry just wasn't cooked long enough?

The poutine had some breaded cheese curds which did not help the flavor/texture (as the gravy just made them very soggy).

The shepherds pie was decent - the smaller lunchtime size was big enough for me.

They do have HP sauce and malt vinegar on all the tables which is a nice touch.

My wife had the fish & chips (which really is fish and wedge fries - and seasoned wedge fries which is just odd).  The whole meal kind of looked like it was from Sysco.

I would not head back here - and also would not say that their food is representative of good English pub fayre."}
{"text":"HOLY BALLS. I love Poutine. I'm talking OBSESSED. The Poutine here as amazing. The curds are fried, the Guinness Gravy is slamming, and the fries are just the right amount of potato.

The amount of craft beers is pretty solid. Lots I haven't seen and many more I have. Lots of bottles to choose from.

The place itself can get pretty full and loud because they have a trivia night here. It's pretty cool, but hard to get seated. Check ahead."}
{"text":"I have been going to dealer school next door for a month and after I got my certificate, a few of us went over to Shakespeare's to have a celebration beer (or two.)  I was shocked at the size when I walked inside..it's much bigger than it looks from the outside.  It was very cute and cozy too.  We all got food and beers and the waitress/bartender gave us separate checks without us even asking for them.  She was very patient with us while we ordered all at different times since some people joined us late.

I thought the food was very good.  I got the fish tacos which came with a salad.  I was very surprised at how good the food was.  After we ate, we played pool for a few hours.  At a buck a game, it was cheap entertainment.  There was a band playing that was okay, but before they set up, the bartender had some blues going on the juke box that I really liked! 

I will definitely be going back.  The food was great, the atmosphere was cozy and warm.

Oh and the best part:  NON Smoking! =)"}
{"text":"Cool little Irish pub. The place is rather large. Great place for a everyday spot to grab a drink and a burger. The food is not bad. It typical pub food. The menu could be designed a bit better as it is a bit hard to read but other than that its all good. The service was friendly. Our drinks came out fast. The place was kinda slow but they have themed nights. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Irish pub sports bar that serves exactly what I wanted off the Vegas strip.  I came in because I had a haircut appointment nearby in an hour, and noticed they had a lunch menu with a smaller shepherd's pie, my favorite gastropub thing to order. 

The food came out quickly and was perfect.  Service was fast and friendly.  I was a happy camper!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food 

Fish and chips are $15 yet there's only 2 pieces of fish (though they are delicious pieces of fish). There were a pile of chips, though, which were good but not great. 

4 stars for service 

Sat in the bar and had great service. My beers slowed down when it got really busy, but my server was still very helpful with deciding on one of the 100+ beers. Even when it got busy, he was still fairly attentive. 

5 stars for entertainment (on Saturday night)

A great band called Rev It Up started around 9. There was an uncalled for number of \"check check 1 2 3\" happening for more than 30 mins which was super annoying but once they started, I forgave them for it. They sang great classic rock tunes. Plus they're awesome with a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone along with keyboard, guitar,  and bass. Don't hear bands like that in just any pub. 

This was my first time here and I really enjoyed myself. I was in town for work and this was a really enjoyable way to spend a Saturday night before an early flight home."}
{"text":"Good full bar, friendly bartenders, friendly staff. Food looked good what ppl was eating. Looks like the fish and chips are a hit there."}
{"text":"So so food. Had to send back a sandwich twice. But they were very nice about it. I agree with who ever posted the comment a few weeks ago about them putting up stickers blighting the neighborhood on street signs and light poles."}
{"text":"It's Friday night and almost 7pm And we decided to check out this local bar.

Thera a lot of parking which was great cause if I can't find a spot... it's on to the next one. 

Outside the bar there's an enclosed areas which I believe on a hot day or the bars full, you can step outside and have a smoke and grab some fresh air or just hang out outside. 

Walking in, it's pretty open and you have to walk all the way in to get service. 

Inside we found the dining areas was pretty full, to the side there's pool tables and two dart boards and next to that is a jukebox And at least 6 TV's showing NCAAF, MLB and NHL.

We sat at the bar and ordered some beers and I ordered the meat pie and hubby ordered the wings. 

I will say this ... if you want to start your night off early with food and drinks come here.. maybe things get crazier later ...but by 8:30 it was still quiet for a Friday night.

The best part about my visit was the meat pie! 
I'm an Aussie and I think I just found my meat pie HotSpot! I'll be back to to eat, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I was there the other day the place was half full two nice bartenders kinda nice......not like the previous lady ...we had an issue with the bill we use a Groupon even if order from happyhour  with out realize the was over  it feel like I was supposed to been told ..:Sorry but happy hour is over \"
No big deal ...and at the end I give my CC with out looking at the final bill .... ups the bill was not adjust properly.
The had to run my CC AGAIN.....not big deal ... I have more than $20 on my card ...lol
BUT WENT I WAS TALL THAT IT WILL CLEAR AT THE END OF THE  NIGHT...
I I knew that wasn't the truth .
anybody can make a little mistake.
Oh yeah we'll be back I really love to cheeseburger the Guinness reduction sauce oh my god very tasty I had my with blue cheese crumbles it very unique flavor"}
{"text":"Can here mid afternoon after running some errands.  Have driven by plenty of time and finally decided to see what it was all about.  From the beer to the food it was just average.  Not bad but not memorable."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out after work with some friends. Fun atmosphere with a great craft beer selection. Ask for my old buddy of many years, Ray!"}
{"text":"This restaurant/poker bar/pub (nonsmoking!) recently changed ownership, and the menu and decor were updated. My favorite changes are the quality of the food and Match Play Mondays. Daily happy hour includes some excellent tacos (2 for $5, fish or chicken) that are really a great deal. I believe Match Play Mondays is a new offering too. They match anyone's deal you bring in up to $100. I've gone many times for this deal and I hope they keep it going! 

The beer selection is most amazing- over 100 total between bottled & a rotating draft list. Brews include many local faves such as Joseph James Rye'd n Dirty, Big Dog's Dirty Dog IPA, Tenaya Creek Pilsner. There was an offering from Lovelady Brewing also when I was there recently. Other standouts I've had are Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Porter & local seasonals such as CraftHaus. 

The bar area is actually quite nice and stays true to the British pub theme. There is plenty of seating in the dining area, and they have a Skee-Ball machine whose prizes include drinks, a burger and a T-Shirt. I think there's a dart board also. They have weekly theme nights, such as Brainstormer Trivia on Wednesdays and karaoke on Fridays. 
A nice place for grabbing some cheap happy hour food and enjoying whatever type of beer you may desire!"}
{"text":"Had an English friend visiting us so we thought we would give this place a try and we were not disappointed.  The beer was cold and fresh and the selection very large.  We then decided to eat and had the following selections:  Fish & Chips, Fish 
Tacos, mini Meat Pie and Sausage Rolls.  Every item was excellent as were the wedge fries and cole slaw.  Fantastic service as well.

No doubt we will be back, perhaps when they have some entertainment."}
{"text":"Shakespeare's is a solid 3 (I'd give 3.5 if I could, but would not go as high as 4). We come at least a couple times a month for trivia, which they do on Tues & Weds every week. Their service is always friendly, their food is acceptable but not great (with a menu that varied it's hard to do half of it really spot on; so far, the best things we've tried have been the meat pies; they're pretty delicious, as well as the chips & curry), and they have a good draught & bottled beer selection with a lot of craft offerings. I'm not sure many people order the craft beers there, though, because it doesn't seem like their inventory turns over very often. We've gotten a couple of expired bottles, and a handful of draughts that tasted fairly stale and/or bottom-of-the-barrel-y. It's a decently pleasant place, though, & it's pretty centrally located if you live in Henderson or Southeast Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the atmosphere, love the servers, love the food and drinks! Food can be a tiny bit pricier than comparable places, but I think it's worth coming here over somewhere else. Cool pub atmosphere with darts, billiard table, and TVs galore (ALWAYS have soccer on in addition to the more mainstream NFL, NBA, NHL and they'll put whatever you want on if they have the channel). Tons of beer on tap, delicious fish sandwich, big ol fat \"fries\" (potato wedges). They even do a Pub Quiz on Wednesday nights at 7:00pm!"}
{"text":"Went here to watch the World Cup 2014.
Service?  There was none.  Complete and utter failure.
We actually tried to go to see the US match, but was turned away because we didn't make reservations.  That was fine.  
This time we had reserved a table, but it didn't matter because the staff was completely unprepared for the event.   Kind of crazy since they are known to be a soccer viewing sports bar.  Rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Shakespeare's to shake things up for our weekly Pub Quiz night out. 

The food was so-so. We tried one of each of the happy hour options - fish taco, slider and chips. Nothing outstanding, but solid efforts. The slider is tiny for the $2 price tag. Tasty, but small. The chips and fish taco were a much more substantial size. They also had some beer specials that were pretty cheap. The other menu items looked pretty good, albeit slightly expensive for pub food. 

As for the Pub Quiz, we usually go to McMullan's every week, and before that Fado. This place pales in comparison to both. The quizmaster reads the questions out clearly, but the time between questions is insanely long. It took so long and our patience started wearing thin about halfway through. 

All in all, the place was just all right, but we'll be back because we have to spend our $25 gift card we won for placing third. Haha."}
{"text":"I had a short but great experience at Shakespeare's! I down the street from it for years but never stopped in. I'm in town visiting my best friend from high school and she told me she has since gone there a ton since we graduated and really likes it and that they had a great selection of beer. I'm in!
When she said they had a great selection of beer, she was right, it's huge! They had a beer (mother earth California creamin') that I had a hard time finding so that was so cool!
Bartenders were all really nice! Didn't interact with them too much, but really enjoyed the environment and the service.. And all the great beer they had to offer! I'll be back here when I'm in town visiting!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place.  The food is great and the karaoke is fabulous.  However, because this is a British themed pub, the food won't be traditional.   But it's still awesome grub.  I woke up hung over and my throat was sore.  For sure signs of a great night....and I have the video to prove it....Amy Lee I am not but it's great to sing your heart out with your friends.  And the staff is great about getting you a cab - wink."}
{"text":"Great place with friendly and fun staff!! Busy atmosphere and fun quiz nights. The food is delicious and the cocktails are awesome!! Great selection of beer. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Do not order the Shepherds Pie for To-Go or delivery.
In fact it's probably best to not order this menu item at all. For $12.99 it's just not worth it.
On the menu it is listed as Minced beef and veggies topped with homemade mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The peas are canned peas. I've tasted a better Shepherds Pie as a prepackaged meal from the store. And that in itself is disappointing."}
