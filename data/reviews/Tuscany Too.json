{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Tuscany on St Nicholas Street, sadly thats where the simularities end. This is not a patch on Tuscany and I would struggle to believe they are run by the same people.    I've been to a fair few of the Italian Restaurants in Scarborough and this one is the only one I would not return to (so far)! I had beef stroganoff from the chefs specials menu, it advertised itslef as fillet steak but i've had more succulent low grade stewing steak from supermarkets.    The service was good but the food let it down. The prices would be reasonable if they offered the same quality food as their sister restuarant in the town centre, sadly they do not."}
{"text":"This is what an Italian restaurant should be like, great atmosphere, friendly efficient staff, and good food. True it is not the cheapest, and probably will not win any Michelin stars, but puts many celebrated chefs to shame.    Proper authentic Italian cooking, with fresh good quality indgrediants."}
{"text":"Tuscany Too may not be central in Scarborough but it's well worth the effort getting there. Took my partner there tonight for a birthday treat, what can i say, great food cooked to perfection, friendly, efficient staff. The restaurant is clean with an authentic feel to it. You may think it's a tad pricey, but you pay for what you get, value. Take the plunge, book a table as i did, you won't be disappoined. No i'm not on commission or a family member, just a member of Joe public sharing a little pleasure."}
{"text":"Its not exactly central to.well, anything much in Scarborough, to be honest, so its a place known more by locals than the tourist element, but that said, its a place which is well worth a visit.    The food is superb - we've eaten here on quite a few occasions since moving to the area a few years ago and never had anything other than a splendid meal. The food is traditional - and authentic - Italian fayre, which are all made to order. The salads in particular are superb and the specials - which actually DO change regularly, ofetn feature very nice fish dishes. I believe the restaurant is owned by an Italian family.    Offering a wide range of traditional pasta dishes too, which are all plentiful and tasty, as well as a pretty good wine list, Tuscany To is a small and intimate venue which is magnificently decorated inside - its like stepping into an authentic venue in Verona or Rome.    Service is always excellent, and its a recommended restaurant. Booking advised at weekends and busier periods.."}
{"text":"Three of us went and three of us left slightly disappointed. The service was friendly and efficient. The starters were very good but the main course was something else. I ordered a rare fillet steak in a blue cheese sauce. When it came the steak had obviously been scorched with one of those hexagonal branding irons. It tasted burnt and not nice at all. The sauce was not cheesy enough. Wine list quite good. Had no grappa which was a bit perplexing for an Italian restaurant. Not bad overall but I am glad someone else paid"}
{"text":"In Scarborough for a week and had this restaurant recommended to us, so we went there last night. My wife said it was the best Italian meal she had ever had (and we have had many). The staff were excellent, catering to our every wish.  A little off the beaten track but well worth the effort of seeking it out. 5 star cooking at a great price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopping in Scarborough for a few nights I decided to to look on Yelp to see if there was any much restaurants in the area and only 0.2 miles away was the Tuscany 2 we didn't book a table as we thought it would be pretty quiet .. How wrong was I it was very busy .. We waited at the bar and had a drink before being shown to our table I ordered the calamari and a steak and the whole meal was just fantastic .. When we are back in the area will will definitely be going back"}
