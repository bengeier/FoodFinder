Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When we walk in I loved the look of the restaurant and as we sat down we had the pleasure of meeting our waiter and he greeted us with a big smile....

The only thing I can say is you have to try it....it looks good it taste better"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this really yummy place on our way to Tremblant. Great cozy atmosphere, friendly staff and great food! We had the chicken brochettes (excellent) Greek potatoes and Greek salad. Amazing tzaziki! They have a great kids menu that my kids loved!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time when I take a drive up north to just \"get away\" from the city hustle. Found this spot and thought meh why not let's see...and see is what we did. Great Gyro ....lamb and pork ...greek salad is just like back home in Greece and great variety of booze to pick from. They even have Mythos beer (????) That's a big plus. Guys you come here for a drive come here and enjoy some great food. They even play greek music from Greece. Take note. Give it a chance guys you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on expedia with highest rate in St Sauveur, so we decided to give it a try after shopping for 2 hours. It did not disappoint us. Souvlakis are super with savory meat, creamy sauce and tomatoes & lettus. I also ordered a onion rings as side dish, golden and crispy. The wait time is a little long but the food deserves our patience."}
{"text":"This is truly a great greek restaurant. The food is great and the staff and owners are very friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to have a great greek food experience."}
{"text":"Very Good! Service was excellent, food was delicious at a great price! Definitely coming back when we are in town next."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing! The food, ambiance, service, price.. It has it all. Our waiter was top notch and the food was exactly, in fact more, than we expected. We were thoroughly satisfied! 
Great deal on the souvlaki plates; 16$ deal for a salad, the main dish, dessert and coffee, plus an entree of fried pita (yummy!!) was included in the meal. Everything was delicious, and good portions. We tried both the pork and beef, and though both were good, the pork was the best. So tender. The baklava for dessert was fantastic. 

We highly recommend this establishment! It's WELL worth it."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of St. Sauveur village. Street parking is available AND no meters.

The place: Love the decor! Very casual, Greek-style, wood floors, simple tables and photos of Greece adorning the walls. This place is not pretentious at all. 

The goods: They offer a good variety of Greek dishes and we went for the chicken souvlaki. First, our waitress brought over fried pita. Umm HI, I love this. Probably not super healthy but it's damn tasty. The pita was the perfect thickness and softness, and served with the best home-made Tzaziki I've had. 

The chicken souvlaki consisted of one chicken brochette, rice, Greek potatoes and a Greek salad. The chicken was perfectly grilled and unlike most places, the rice was super flavourful. I love rice so I don't dish out that compliment lightly! The potatoes were amazing - perfectly roasted and seasoned, and whatever deliciousness the chef used to sprinkle on the rice/potatoes topped things off nicely. The salad was OK - your basic Greek dish, with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta. 

Finally, even though I had very little room, I felt it was my duty to try the Baklava. It was very good, and not super sweet, but there was an overpowering taste of cinnamon that was a bit too much for me.

It's worth it to mention that these guys make everything from scratch except the pita bread. And don't even think about asking where they buy it - it's a well-kept secret!

Service: Considering our waitress was alone on the floor, and the place was almost full, she did a pretty great job. Very friendly! It was a bit slow to get our food but we weren't in a hurry and  really, why would anyone complain about receiving a freshly cooked dish? Not me!

Price point: The fact is that prices in St. Sauveur tend to be on the higher dude because there are so many tourists. The souvlaki was $16 which I find a little steep, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance was great!! Pictures of greece everywhere you look.lovely music playing.Authentic greek dishes and tastes. Ordered a plate full of lamb and pork souvlaki and chicken to share that came with potatoes rice and greek salad.Delicious!! We were so happy with our meal .great marination and cooking. They even gave us free appetizer on the house since the wait was a bit long.So nice our them to take care of their customers like that. I will always go back to Souvlaki 7 when im in St-Sauveur!"}
{"text":"Located smack in the middle of St-Sauveur village, Souvlaki 7 is easy to find just off the main market square near the town church. Parking was somewhat of an issue and I found myself walking a fair way to get to this resto. Nothing out of the ordinary if I was in downtown Montreal but a little surprising for somewhere like St-Sauveur. The main street is pretty small, so parking is reserved in specific areas.

The decor of Souvlaki 7 is about as traditional as you can get with run-of-the-mill Greek establishments. Lots of white/blue and pictures of beautiful Greek locations you wish you actually at. Overall, it's family friendly and accommodating.

We were famished after a fun family outing and I got to enjoy a nice big plate of tzatziki and a gyro pork pita. Both were quite good. The tzatziki was very garlicky, which makes it... the best kind of tzatziki!!! The gyro pita was good, with a generous amount of tzatziki but... not so much in terms of meat. The ratio was a bit off for my liking.

Our waitress was very friendly and competent. Turn-around time for food was acceptable. Price-tag was a bit high for what it is but I won't complain."}
{"text":"This place is always full in the summer!! Nice location, right on rue Principale so you can't miss it!

The service was good but of course don't expect it to be perfect since it's always full.

The food is so so so good! Like any other greek restaurants, they offer gyro sandwiches, but what i loved about this place is that you can have it spicy, which I've never had before. 

You really should try it, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Comme entrée des pains pita avec sauce tzatziki était excellent et brochettes souvlaki poulet et lard avec riz et patates grecque était délicieux. Le propriétaire Andy et notre serveur Edouard était très gentils avec un excellent service. Nous allons revenir c'est certain"}
{"text":"It's about time someone opened a souvlaki restaurant in Saint Sauveur. 

This place does not disappoint. The food is fresh and all made in house. Service was fast and very friendly. I enjoyed my meal very much and I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went shopping at Mont St-Sauveur outlets, and was looking for a restaurant afterwards and found this great place.

When we walked in we were the only ones there, which kinda scared me, but the waitress was so friendly and welcoming. She explained the me u and gave us the house specialties. We ordered chicken pita gyro and chicken souvlaki plate. As appetizers I ordered an authentic greek salad.

Everything was finger licking good. The salad was really authentic, the chicken was so juicy and OMG that tsaziki sauce was to die for, the best sauce I have ever tasted, ever better than the one I had in Greece. The pita, were so fresh and thick it was something between the pita's and naan. It was delicious. They also had several Greek beer choices not only Mythos.

The inside was white and blue and had beautiful pictures of Greece. My only critique would be that they need to update their benches and they were really worn out. But the food is amazing. A definite place I would come back and recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"We really like this little restaurant on rue Principale! I'd give it 4.5 if I could.

It is decorated as with pictures of Greece and we remenisced our trip a few years ago. The waitress was very nice and the restaurant was crowded even if it was a Monday night.

I cannot say I was impressed by the appetizers but the main meals were amazing. They were very generous portions, and the price was very reasonable. It cost 80$ for food tax/service included for 4."}
{"text":"Delicious calamari, souvlaki and gyros. Clean, good relaxing atmosphere.  Greek salad was refreshing and full of feta cheese. Calamari came with tzatziki sauce and another sauce that was amazing. Too bad I don't remember the name of that sauce, was something in French."}
{"text":"Nourriture rapide et excellente, l'ambiance est vraiment enjouée (les bières Grecques sont vraiment bonnes aussi!) Je me sentais en Grèce à nouveau"}
{"text":"Très bons Souvlakis, presque aussi bons que ceux de mon beau-père, et il s'y connaît... Bonne ambiance tamisée, décoration charmante et moderne, accueil chaleureux, bref, le meilleur arrêt Ever sur la route de tremblant..."}
{"text":"If you are ever up North this is a great place for a casual Gyros or anything else Greek. The Brochette plate was great, tasty and portions are generous. I had the Gyros and it was excellent (better than Village Grec & Neo's who are both very good).
Service is attentive and good, it is a little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our lunch here the other day! We came around 1pm on a Friday to a place with a couple of tables full but plenty of seating to go around

As previous reviews state, parking is a bit difficult but you can find options a couple blocks away. 

The servings are massive, and all entrees are served with salad, rice + either potatoes or fries. The average prices of entrees were around 16-20 a person. Not too bad but still on the high end. 

I really enjoyed their Tzatziki sauce, and our meats were seasoned just perfectly. We were pleased!"}
{"text":"Fast food place pretending to be a restaurant. If you  don't want fried pita they may charge you for the regular grilled. Chicken skewers were very dry. 
Would not return"}
