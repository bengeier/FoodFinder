{"text":"I usually come here to eat sushi or get my usual tempura udon noodles, but today I dined in with some friends that introduced me to the Malaysian menu. I never noticed this menu at the Pacific East on Chagrin? 

In any case, I highly recommend exploring the menu and trying the noodle dishes.  I love noodles and I was not disappointed.  It was a nice twist on Asian cuisine. I was a little wary about trying the okra dish, but after 1 bite, I was hooked! Since I did not do any ordering, I cannot give any specific recommendations. I only remember the roti canei? It reminds me of naan, but thinner. It tastes so good warm and it's served with a spicy curry!! The left over curry can also be added to your rice. Lets not waste good food :)!!!

If my Malaysian friend is reading this review, thank you for all your food recommendations!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time getting a hot pot type soup. The soup was nothing special, but the pot it came in was cool. 

The second time I ordered a lot: Sashimi dinner, curry croquette appetizer, and tempura ice cream desert. 

The service is fine, nothing wrong with it except that when I got appetizer it was the wrong croquette and the waitress didn't believe me. The appetizer actually came out after my main course which I thought wasn't too bad as the chef could've been busy. But then Sashimi tasted fishy and they also gave me seared tuna \"sashimi\". It's obviously just left over fish that they hadn't used up so they just gave it to me in the Sashimi dinner. I ended up with food poisoning that night. 

The worst thing is that it is the only Japanese restaurant within a 30 min travel radius and so if I ever want Japanese food I'd have to come here. Since I'm used to being in NYC with the wide range and availability of Japanese food, I sorely miss it sometimes. I'd probably have to come back here if I ever want sushi, but if I had any other choices I would chose something else."}
{"text":"This might not have the very best sushi, but we are in Cleveland, and with that in mind, it is good. What I really love is that I can start with roti prata, then have some sushi, and finish with some other delicious malaysian entree. There is no other restaurant in Cleveland that I can do this.
Malaysian food is awesome, and they do it pretty well. Good service. Decent atmosphere for casual dining."}
{"text":"Ate here twice when we traveled to Cleveland.  It is wonderful!  We are vegetarian, and enjoyed the many items that we chose to eat:  Tofu, veggies, tempura, clay pot casseroles, great sauces!  My son really liked the Bubble Tea.  The ambiance was divine, we visited at night both times.  Helpful, friendly waitresses.  I will never forget this place, and plan to eat here again when we visit Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome service. Waitresses were very polite & helpful. I suggest the Ika-Maru (squid) & the eel. Pacific East is now a staple in my destinations of good food."}
{"text":"Got some takeout from here a few weeks back, sooooooooo good! Call ahead for it though, they are super busy. The only thing I did not like is they packed my food and my coworkers food in the same container. It was a lil creepy to eat that way. But ridiculous good and fresh soosh :) 10 out of 10 will eat again."}
{"text":"For the record - I don't eat raw fish, or most sushi.  So I am not judging this place for its sushi quality.  Maybe it's really the best in Cleveland.  They certainly have a vast array of choices, which is nice.  Especially for veggies - they have more than one obligatory \"veggie\" roll.  I find that refreshing.  And actually I have no complaints with the veggie rolls, they are solid.  However, I do have complaints with:

1. The smell.  This place reeks of seafood.  And since I'm pretty sure seafood shouldn't reek if it's fresh, I don't understand how their raw sushi could be so good.  Either way, the odor makes dining there unpleasant.
2. The decor.  It's tacky.  Maybe some people find that charming.  I find it tacky.
3. The tempura.  Again, I love that you get so many a la carte options.  Build your own tempura dinner.  But the batter to subject ratio is way off; you just end up eating copious amount of breading.  And the flavor is completely lacking.  No salt even, just plain bread.  The pieces are massive and difficult to maneuver.  The sauce is also bland, not even salty.
4. The service.  This is why I'm yelping now.  We went there recently on a weeknight.  It was 9:35pm.  Most other eating establishments in Coventry were already closed, which I found shocking and sad.  It was only 9:35pm!  Pacific East is open until 10pm, according to the sign, so we were relieved.  When we were seated, we were informed immediately that they closed at 10, and that the last call for food was 9:45pm.  We said fine, no worries.  Because the menu is massive, we needed a few minutes to peruse.  In the course of the next 5 minutes, the servers came over literally four times to see if we were ready.  Despite the fact that we were poring over the menu, and could easily have looked up as soon as we were ready.  Then, our food was served all at once, and a check immediately placed on the table.  They also started collecting items (like the soy sauce bottle) OFF the table.  While we were eating.  Then they came over asking us to pay the bill, even though we were still eating, because the cash register allegedly got turned off at 9:50.  As if it was not within their control.  The magical cash register gods just turn it off.  So we scarfed down our food, paid, and got the hell out of there.  It was extremely unpleasant.  These folks seem to think that being open until 10:00pm means having every single patron out of the restaurant by then.  When it reality it usually means you serve food until then.

Again, not hating on this place for cheap sushi, and a way to please different levels of sushi and non-sushi lovers.  But I feel no need to return."}
{"text":"Hope the owners read this:

I called in a to-go order before my flight. Later I was running late for my schedule and didn't have time to go pick it up. I told them to charge it on my card anyways, but they were really nice about it and said it was okay. 

All I can say is, these guys really do show good service and care about the customer. Please please go eat here! And btw, the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning twice, I will not return here. I should have known better when eating a crab roll and tasting that less than fresh fish taste. The other star is for the good service, but that's all."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our experience.  At 5:30 they were already out of the roti appetizer.  For our party of eight, the dishes can out at 10-12 minute intervals, so my daughter got her entree about 25 minutes after the first entree arrived.  The laksa soup was just average.  Really no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Taking just about their sushi, they have some of cleveland's best for the price. You can expect to pay about 8-10 fit each serving, and they are pretty much the standard size. Haven't really tried anything else so I can't comment."}
{"text":"Kudos to Pacific East for upping their game. Havent been here in 3 years, but just went this weekend. First off, they changed the layout of the store, even adding another room for diners. The wait service was awesome - I've never been waited for so intently in my life! And the food. Usually I go for the sushi, but this time I tried the Mango Chicken. It was full of flavor and came with chicken, cooked veggies, and mango slices all placed in the shell of the Mango. Presentation was superb. And the tuna was deli-shus. 

I've been to Sushi Rock and though the atmosphere was more \"hip\" and \"in\", the food was not. Pacific East has much better food at a much better price with many choices. I'd recommend coming here for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my family here. We ordered sushi and some dishes off the regular menu. I can say, the food was good. What impressed me the most was the mango pork chop dish. Sounds a little strange together, but it was packed with flavor. THe sushi were pleasing as well. 

So the food was good, but the service could use a little work. More smiling could help, and that face of \"I didn't want to come to work today\" should of been left at home. The food shouldn't be loudly left on the table without saying a word. An upset looking server could ruin a whole experience for a customer. 
I'm not writing this to discourage anyone to come here, but to simply say my service could use a little work. That would of made my experience here a little better."}
{"text":"I have only enjoyed Pacific East from the comfort of my home, via carry out.  A variety of rolls and miso soup.  The rolls are larger than I am used to (and I have eaten sushi all over the place, both coasts and throughout the Midwest), so when my husband and I share four rolls, we're stuffed.  

The fish is fresh.  The rice has good texture.  The veggies are crisp.  I pretty much stick to nigiri and rolls when eating food from a Japanese restaurant, so I can't comment on other entrees at Pacific East.  What I have eaten has been great.

Another plus: when we call to place an order, they answer the phone, promptly and courteously!  Only negative (and it isn't a big one): we don't eat in the restaurant because it isn't exactly kid-friendly, kind of small and best suited for couples."}
{"text":"I would have rated Pacific East a 5, if not for their terrible service. They were filled to capacity and literally had one server working. Now, on the good stuff. Their sushi is the best in Cleveland, hands down. Their basic Maki rolls are huge and their Specialty rolls are almost too big! The fish is fresh and the rice is the perfect texture. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, as long as you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I love coming to Pacific East. The staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxing. We usually get sushi and tempura, both good quality and reasonably priced. While this may not be the best Japanese restaurant you ever go to, it's still very enjoyable. Love having a Malaysian menu to choose from as well. We always have a good experience here. I definitely recommend it if you're in the Coventry area."}
{"text":"Ate an early dinner with my husband and received great service.  We ordered the king crab roll which was very good.  We also ordered the beef teriyaki which had great flavor but was not super tender.  Lastly we had the chicken udon which was the best of all 3 dishes.   Great flavor, super hot, noodles and broth were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for Cleveland sushi, handrolls and maki combo are great.  I take my girlfriend here whenever we are in Cleveland.  Consistently happy with the sushi.  They could drop most of the entrees from the menu, in my opinion (Teriyaki isn't that great, other things are okay).  Nonetheless, I consider this one of the better sushi places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Meh. It's got some good dishes, but the sushi was entirely unimpressive (specifically, the rice wasn't very good. It was too dry and not sticky enough. It also just didn't taste great), and my Yasai Don was actually bad. That said, there were good points. My friend liked his Udon, and the Roti Chanai was actually very tasty. My Thai Tea clearly used powdered creamer though, instead of sweetened condensed milk. 

Given that Malaysian food is somewhat hard to find, and that the Roti Chanai was pretty good, you might have some luck with the Malaysian menu, but don't go there for Japanese food. Cleveland has *much* better options there. Instead, go to Shinano or maybe Shuhei (I haven't been there since returning from LA, so I'm not certain of the quality, but I remember it fondly)  which both have quality Japanese food, just at higher prices than the same food would cost in LA. Shinano in particular I adore. Oh, and if you are craving good Thai Iced Tea, Peppermint has the best I've tasted yet in Cleveland, although I've not tasted enough places to be sure that I've found the best. 

But seriously, I'm absolutely *shocked* that people are saying that this is the best sushi in Cleveland. It isn't, not by a long shot."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in Cleveland! The rolls are a good portion and equally delicious. I also ordered a cut of Toro, which is a premium cut of fatty tuna. So delicious! The Mai Tais are awesome as well."}
{"text":"I can only recommend the sushi, but it is amazing. I've tried so many different rolls here and they are all very fresh, well presented and delicious. My favorite is the shrimp tempura roll and the sweet potato roll (which I've never seen anywhere else). The only place I'll get sushi in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best sushi in Cleveland. Delicious Japanese menu, good Malaysian menu, can accommodate groups. The restaurant can be crowded on weekends however."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland, hands down. My wife and I had the spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, and Westfield rolls to go every Friday night for our one year stay in Cleveland. It was always consistently good. The rice was cooked perfectly, the fish was always fresh. Our last few days in Cleveland, we had no idea Pacific East was going to be closed, so on our last evening we had to settle for Sushi Rock. TERRIBLE! Don't waste your money at Sushi Rock and find your way over to Pacific East on Coventry. I can't speak for the service because we always ordered to go, but you will not be disappointed by the quality of the product. And the prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Everything was very tasty, and you gets lots of food! Would very much recommend any of the curry options or the soups! The waitresses also made every attempt to customize our order and they did an outstanding job ::) Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our family eats here every couple weeks we love it so much. The sushi is out of this world, the Malaysian menu is fabulous, the bubble tea is delicious...really we like so many things about this place! My favorite dish is the vegetarian pan fried noodles made with soft ramen noodles (you have to ask), but I've loved everything I've eaten here. We have eaten every kind of sushi, and it's wonderful and fresh."}
{"text":"We've just fallen in love with sushi and made it a mission to try everyplace in town. We started with Sushi Rock, moved on to Sumo and just the other night tried Pacific East.

So far, this place is my 2nd favorite. The food is reasonably priced and tasty. The service was attentive and our meals arrived surprisingly quickly (for a sushi place). We'll definitely be going back.

That being said, I still like Sushi Rock better."}
{"text":"Great place! This is our go to place for sushi in CLE. They have a tuna appetizer that is served in the shape of a heart and is possibly the most refreshing and delicious thing on a hot summer night!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't know if it was because we went at 930pm and it was near closing, or a busy Friday night. The fish was past room temperature, (disgusting) for raw fish. The rolls are to big, not an enjoyable big roll, but you need to cut in half to eat. Service was horrid. My wife ordered a Pepsi, they don't do free refills, so she ordered a water. The waitress filled her Pepsi cup with water instead of bringing her a new cup. I guess I have higher standards than the yelp reviewers. Never again."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at Pacific East - anywhere from three to five stars. Right now, I'm settling for four stars. The kitchen seems to be a little uneven on the details. For instance, one time I got a piece of tuna with enough hidden wasabi to eviscerate my sinuses. And this last time, some of the fish was so cold, I could barely eat it. But it's still my favorite sushi place in the Cleveland area, and that counts for a lot. It's like a close friend that irks you sometimes - you keep on hanging out."}
{"text":"Having grown up in NY, I've eaten a lot of good sushi. With that being said, Pacific East can roll with the big boys. Delicious and affordable!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually the best sushi restaurant in Cleveland. They have the freshest fish and good selections. If you compare it to other cities, its probably just average. Everyone have touched on their sushi and bubble tea already. I will say the other items on the menu is pretty good. They have a very good udon selection and a one of the kind Malaysian menu. If you tired of sushi, give those selections a try."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in Cleveland.  Maybe not the best, but the lunch specials are a great deal.  Some delicious rolls.  The spicy tuna has an excellent texture, and the tempura is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after hearing raving reviews about the food. We went on a Saturday night, and it was packed. Good thing we made a reservation or else we would have been stuck in a long line with our empty stomachs. 

The ambience at Pacific East is nice. The restaurant is dimly lit with fish/sea shell decor on the walls that complements the name of the restaurant.

Upon glancing at the two extensive menus (one for Japanese food, the other for Malaysian), I was a bit overwhelmed. One of the entrees we ordered was a maki combo, with one of the sushi rolls being crab. I'm a huge sushi fan, but I was not impressed with the sushi here at Pacific East. 

Maybe we were expecting too much, but it was a bit misleading when we tasted imitation crab in the crab rolls. I think they could have at least been a little more specific in their menu that they're using imitation crab instead of actual crab. Regardless, the sushi was just okay. Nothing special and nothing worth raving about.

Can't say much about the Malaysian food at the restaurant, but I didn't think that Pacific East served authentic Japanese food/sushi. My theory is that if a restaurant is serving two very different types of Asian cuisine, chances are the restaurant is only doing one of them justice at best. 

Maybe I'll go back to try some of the Malaysian food some time, but probably not going back for sushi. Still on the look for a go-to place for sushi in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in Cleveland, it's got fresh sushi, full rolls, nice lunch special with a good salad, open late, quick in preparing pick up orders.  My favorite rolls are the Alaska and Christmas.  Nice servers.  I think the dishes are a bit rice heavy and tend to stick to the sushi though."}
{"text":"I've only been here once on a double date and it was on a Saturday night, but we did get seated right away. The wait staff was about average in terms of attentiveness, but the place was packed (which might be a sign that others in the area like this place too). Everyone ordered something very different and we all enjoyed our meals. I didn't have the sushi, but others at the table had some as an appetizer and loved it. I had a rice dish with various cooked seafood (if I knew the name I'd type it). The serving size was enough for two and the taste was fantastic. I hate Asian food that masks cheap ingredients with salt and other seasoning. My dish was seasoned right. The price was reasonable. We had a nice time and I'd go back with friends or with my wife."}
{"text":"I love this place. The shiitaki mushroom sushi is fantastic. I would eat here every day of the week if I could!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi.  Some interesting Malaysian stuff on the menu.  My friend got some coconut chicken dish that was pretty good.  I got 3 rolls of sushi that was forgettable."}
{"text":"Not too impress with Pacific East. The place does have a bad smell when you first walk in.
Order toro they do give you a big piece but it is not very good! My kid order Udon which was just ok.
Both of my kids get sick at night,both of them have to miss school today!!"}
{"text":"best place for sushi in cleveland. On the Corner of Coventry and Mayfield Road its one of those places you can drive by all the time and never venture into. Its worth the 75 cents in parking to mosey into this great authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"To start off, I've been here only once. :) And, yes, I  do agree, that the \"wait staff\" has been traditionally helpful. They even let me wait inside away from the cold a couple of times... Afraid that this was only a \"weird sea-food place,\" no offense, it had not really occurred to me to go there before. But, once I had the chance, a couple weeks ago, I grabbed it: I went in a party of 5 (myself, included), and we had the most delicious meal with the typical to the unusual: Miso, or soy-based soup with algae and onions skimming the top of it; as well as my all-time favorite: pan-fried noodles. Yum Yum!!! :DDDDD

Nothing could be better than those two menu items...Oh, and the waiters, were friendly, they were knowledgeable, of course, and they also were patient and served hot tea for a very low fee. This place's for me!!! :)

~Suphie"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch today! Best miso soup I have had in years, cozy and cute. Ginger dressing on salad tasted very fresh, great lunch!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great.  Very fresh and flavorful.  They have a good selection of maki rolls and they are generously sized.  I always get the yellow tail with scallions roll; the tuna is a good color and not fatty, but sometimes lacks flavor; the shrimp tempura roll is also good, but sometimes is a tad limp.  Overall, you can't beat the freshness or scrumptious simplicity.  There is no ocean nearby, afterall.  Pacific East is a neighborhood gem. 

For lunch, the maki combos can't be beat for value.  I get one for lunch more often than I'd like to admit!"}
{"text":"I've only been once but I'd say I'm a fan. A lot of variety and a lot of food. The place was hoppin but we didn't wait too long. I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi but I got diarrhea all night. I suspect from one of the maki rolls."}
{"text":"For the price, the best Sushi I've had anywhere!!! Excellent quality of fish. Been there over 50 times and only once we were disappointed! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love sushi and this place is the best sushi in Cleveland Heights. The service is great, they have an EXCELLENT menu & they are relatively inexpensive. Take out is also great from this place.

The only drawback is that the restaurant is small... but I am willing to wait."}
{"text":"I did take out from here and ordered the tempura and America roll.  The tempura was very good.  The America roll was a contender though you can probably get better in Hawaii or on the west coast but for Cleveland or western Pennsylvania, the sushi was good and reasonable.  I would recommend this place especially if you are craving Japanese food and you haven't had it in a while."}
{"text":"I guess this is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Cleveland. It doesn't come close to Japanese Restaurants in Cali or NY... but it's not bad. 

Pros: Staff are nice, Restaurant has plenty of seats, Wide variety of Japanese/ Malaysian food

Cons: Prices are a bit high for the quality"}
{"text":"My favorite place in this neighborhood. I went so many times with friends. I tried sushi, fried rice and noodle, all good! Several times the food served a little slow because there were so many people. A good choice for Asian flavor in Cleveland~"}
{"text":"I had three different sushi rolls. They were fine, but nothing special. Service wasn't particularly attentive, and it took a long time to get our food. It wasn't very busy, so we were a little surprised. The sushi was definitely better than Tree Country's, though, so I'll probably be back when I'm craving a spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in Cleveland, and at an unbeatable price! While it doesn't quite have the service or ambiance of an upscale sushi restaurant, the sushi is fresh and delicious. As with most sushi restaurants, I recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the full experience!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is...meh. Having dined in and ordered carry out, just dine in. Beware, they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING but the food is legit. The lunch prices are phenomenal. The prawn mee is my favorite."}
{"text":"I think there used to be an Indian Restaurant in this spot.  I had Sushi here before, and it was really tastey.  Had good choices for Sake, not just the crappy hot Sake most places serve.  They even gave us a tasting of plumb wine.  I hope it gets more business then the last time I was there."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Sushi Bar with much more to offer. I've been coming to Pacific East ever since I was in High School and there has never been fluctuation in my experience. The food is amazing and their sushi is some of the best in Cleveland Heights. They may not have the best atmosphere but if you're going to a restaurant for atmosphere and not the food, then you should go somewhere else, food is their priority."}
{"text":"Still one of my go-to restaurants, but the roti canai has really gone downhill... the last four times I've been, there has been just way too much anise in the curry. Please fix the roti canai curry, Pacific East! It was the perfect dish, but now I never order it :("}
{"text":"ROTTEN fish I'm so disgusted I paid and got out of that horrid place, sushi is supposed to be fresh not old and tasting off I know sushi and this place is disturbing I puked right after I left"}
{"text":"My new fave Sushi restaurant! The food was delicious, service very good & prices quite reasonable. The Spider roll was incredible, the Seaweed Salad was a very generous portion, & the apps (Gyoza & Shrimp Shumai) were terrific. I highly recommend Pacific East  as possibly the best Sushi around !!"}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say that the best sushi I've ever had was at this little hole in the wall on the ocean in Virginia Beach. Ahhh, sun setting, waves gently crashing, drinks, my friend and her navy seal boyfriend and all of his crazy friends, 80 degree weather....back to reality! 
I love sushi, but don't eat exclusively at any one spot in Cleveland. When I have a taste for it, whichever restaurant is the closest will be the chosen one. There are several I won't go to, Otani's in Golden Gate being at the top of that pile. 
I chose to review Pacific East because while living in Little Italy this was the closest and I ate there at least once a week. I live on the west side now, but still work on the east. Often, I stop in to pick up an order to go. Over the many, many times my orders have always been very fresh, warm, soft and just consistent. I'm a big fan of consistency when eating a preferred meal at any given restaurant. It is irritating when I expect something that I just know is going to be good and taste like it did the last time I ordered it, but it doesn't...I guess that's why my old boss would always tell me to not to have expectations, because then you won't get let down. Expect the bare minimum and be pleasantly surprised. I worshiped that man, but never did agree with that piece of advice. Pacific East always lives up to my expectations."}
{"text":"You know how when you go to an \"authentic\" restaurant and it's not really authentic? That's NOT this place. Hands down it's the most authentic Japanese/sushi place in Cleveland and I've been to a lot of them. Here's how I can tell.

1. They always have Toro. You don't find that everywhere. And it was amazing.
2. They have the biggest selection of Sake in Cleveland.
3. Everyone's Japanese. Like from Japan, not a Japanese person who grew up in Parma.

Excellent food. A bit pricey but you're paying for authenticity. If you want strip mall sushi go somewhere else. This is the real deal. Rolls are huge. Got the Maki sushi platter which comes with three \"standard\" rolls and I could not finish half of it. Kids loved it too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times it is surprising to me, that I have never written a review!

I absolutely love the sushi here and think it is one of the best in Cleveland. Just looking at the sushi bar you can see how fresh the fish looks! I have never had a bad roll here!

I have also ordered off the Malaysian menu and have to say I really love the Mango fried rice (it's served IN a mango). I have had multiple fried rice dishes as well as an udon noodle bowls and all dishes have been packed with flavor!

No matter what you order, you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the Heights. We are serious sushi lovers. We keep meaning to try other things on the menu, and then we arrive, and the sushi calls out to us..... \"Eeeeeaaat meeeee.....\" So we do.

So our typical dinner here is: miso soup, a small salad, possibly but not always tempura or gyoza appetizer or seaweed salad, and then a lot of sushi. My husband gets Japanese beer and I get green tea.

We often order stuff off the Special board that is behind the sushi chefs, because that is all fresh & in season & really good.  We have tried some amazing and surprising stuff that was on the Special board, some times things that we never heard of before. But never was I sorry to have tried a new sushi.  However, we are adventuresome eaters -- maybe you wouldn't like these things, you have to trust your own sense of yourself on this.

 If we are not totally filled after the sushi, we might split a green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining here regularly for years. Definitely one of our favorite restaurants of ANY kind in the Cleveland area. They have two extensive menus, one Japanese and one Malaysian. I have ordered from both. On the Japanese menu, the sushi and sashimi are terrific--delicious, generous portions, reasonably priced. You can even have your rolls made with brown rice if you prefer! If sushi isn't your thing I would also recommend the Shiitake Mushroom Soup, Zaru Soba noodles, and the Sautéed Assorted Wild Mushrooms. My husband is a fan of the tempura. On the Malaysian side, I love the Laksa or the Singapore Style Stir-Fried Hokkin Seafood Noodles. But there is SO much more on both of the menus, you are sure to find something you love. Service is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi.  The rolls are very large and the price is great.  For $3-4 you get 6 very large pieces.  The service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Even if you're not a fan of sushi and/or Japanese food, you should visit and try their Malaysian menu which is outstanding. The rendang, laksa and chow kueh teow are authentic and delicious. Very reasonable priced as well."}
{"text":"Giant Menu! I've been pretty impressed with most of the things I've had here. Admittedly, my boyfriend has felt he's often ordered \"the wrong thing\" here on numerous occasions. Therefore, not everything is great but the menu is so large that there are many solid selections to be had here and the price is right. Great prices. 

I have really enjoyed all the sushi I've had with the exception of spicy tuna. Also, another favorite, is the eggplant appetizer.

Service can be slow when busy but overall if you want a good deal and an endless selection to choose from - this is a good bet."}
{"text":"New to the Cleveland area so thought we'd scope out some new places. Built up an appetite after the gym and decided to give Pacific East a try. The place felt a little stuffy due to the cooking oil and poor ventilation. We got the sushi bridge for two (definitely enough to feed at three). Biggest salmon fan but favorite dish there was the seared ahi and unagi (eel) nigiri...might just get the unagi donburi next time with some of the char kway teow (Malaysian chow fun??) that looked amazing."}
{"text":"I used to live in New York and would eat sushi 3 to 4 times a week. I have never gotten sick from it. I've also eaten sushi in London and Japan. This place? I had food poisoning the first time I went there. Only had a spicy salmon and a spicy yellowtail roll. Flash forward four months. My boyfriend and I really wanted to have some Japanese food. We ordered soft shell crap, eel sashimi, uni sashimi, and a couple of hand rolls. We were both vomiting by the end of the night. I do not get the appeal of this place. It's awful.

And the Junmai Sake tasted like swill."}
{"text":"Dear Cleveland Sushi Fan,
I would be interested to know if there are places in Clev-o that serve better sushi than Pacific East.  Really.  I was pleasantly surprised by this spot.  I am simply wondering if someone else can offer an alternative?
Thank you,
Curious"}
{"text":"They have a separate Malaysian menu! I have no idea how their sushi was, but their Malayasian items are pretty good!

The laska was light and mild, fried frog legs were delicate and flavorful, and the roti canai was amazing. We were driving through from Michigan to Pennsylvania for a wedding, and my husband was willing to stop there on the way back just so he could have more roti canai."}
{"text":"I like heading out to Pacific East with one other friend or date. It is very homey and unpretentious. It is the perfect atmosphere to let your guard down and get to know another person. They also have a nice selection of what I consider \"gateway sushi\" or \"comfort food of sushi\" (such as the Boston Roll). I don't know why, but I love to go there on rainy days. There is something moody about watching the rain through their front windows. 

When you are finished, you can always window shop on Coventry."}
{"text":"I am not crazy about the seating and decor, but the sushi is great."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed.  I ordered the Chicken Basil (off the Malaysian menu) and the boy ordered the Sesame Chicken.  We shared an order of veggie gyoza (think potstickers).  Everything was very good.  After having just eaten at Mint Cafe up the street, I still say I prefer Mint to Pacific East because the food is better, the atmosphere is more quaint, and the service is better.  I cannot speak for the sushi at Pacific East but I hear it's good.  1/28/2011--we went back here and had another great dinner.  This time I ordered the Rendang chicken and it was SO YUMMY.  Wow.  Perfectly spiced and mixed with coconut milk.  Boyfriend got the Beef stir fry noodles and they were good but he was hoping for a little bit more spice.  Good service."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique restaurants I have ever dined in.  You have a fairly standard menu of Japanese items plus a whole second menu of Malaysian food.  So mostly this review is for their Japanese menu, though we did try the roti.

So, the food was pretty good.  As I already stated, we tried the roti (bread) which was delicious.  We also had a pretty standard tempura appetizer as well as better than average tuna tartare.  The rest of the meal consisted of just about every interesting maki roll on the menu plus a few orders of sashimi.  The sushi was good and fresh though we agreed it could be a little more flavorful.  The maki rolls seemed overly basic even though they had some interesting ingredients.  I had to order an extra side of spicy mayo.  We did like the golden dream and west field rolls best.

Good sushi, good pricing, good service.  Just nothing special that would get me craving more..."}
{"text":"Not only was the sushi very tasty, their extensive selection of non-sushi Japanese food was great.  I wanted to cry over the dengaku nasu and a few other sides that I  haven't had since I left Japan.  I can't speak to the main entrees, since we just shared sushi and a bunch of sides.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch, and each time it's been really good! The wait can be long and service can be really slow. Each time I've gone to Pacific East, both for takeout and dine-in, it's been crowded.  So that's a sign of good food in itself!
While it is the best sushi I've had in Cleveland, it really pales in comparison to sushi in Los Angeles. But I'm spoiled because that's what I grew up with. Either way it's still good.  I really like ordering the unagi kabayaki- it's the same as unagi don minus the rice and way cheaper.  I also like the seafood udon and the iso maki roll. I didn't try the Malaysian food until I came here with my boyfriend and he ordered stir fried beef noodles-if they're on the menu, he'll order them. He judges a restaurant's quality by the quality of their friggin stir fried beef noodles. BUT, they're good. Really good.  Also I just remembered that their hot green tea is especially good! It has that toasted, nutty flavor. I should remember to ask where they get their green tea next time I'm in there, it's seriously the best.
Pacific East has never screwed up my takeout order when I choose not to dine in.  They always package it really well and it's so satisfying to open it up when I get home after a long day. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I used to work here as a waiter. Yes, I was a terrible waiter! But I absolutely loved the food.

As a sushi lover I can say that this place is one of the best in the Cleveland area. The owner is passionate about his work (I don't think he understands the concept of vacation). The fish is very fresh and the portions are great for the price.

I typically start of with a Roti Chanai appetizer (flakey Indian nan with a curry dipping sauce) or the baked mussels. The ABSOLUTE must haves at this place is the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Spider Roll (deep fried soft shell crab!). Couple the rolls with some sashimi a la carte, I go for the Toro and tuna sashimi, and you will have yourself a good night."}
{"text":"Overall:  Everything was decent, but I was not particularly impressed.  If I am in the area again, I may give it another go because I may not have ordered the right items the first time.

Food:  I ordered off the Malaysian menu, including the curry puff, hainanese chicken, coconut butter jumbo shrimp, and malaysia style curry beef.   The shrimp arrived cold.  The other items were yummy but plain given the price and quantity provided.

Atmosphere:  Nicer than your average Chinese takeout restaurant, but nothing fancy."}
{"text":"I liked this place so much I came back! Last time in Cleveland, back in April, the numerous rave Yelp reviews drew my attention.  I walked in and sat at the counter where and man and his daughter offered up the last seat next to them. He then proceeded to help me out with the unique menu and board.  
Try the Seared Salmon Belly sashimi! My salads, sushi and sashimi last time and this visit are fresh and fantastic.  Service is excellent and the prices suitable for exploring their specialties."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to find a really good sushi restaurant when we travel, and my sister recommended Pacific East. We ordered the roti canai as an appetizer and it was delicious. It came with a small cup of chicken curry and two pieces of roti. The roti was flaky and chewy and everything I want out of carbs. The chicken curry had just a little bit of spice and great flavor.

For the main dish, we ordered 10 pieces of sashimi and 4 rolls. We got 2 pieces of o-toro, which was pricey, but worth it because we've never had toro before. We also got 2 pieces of bluefin tuna and 6 pieces of salmon. The sashimi portions are very generous, which I really appreciate as a sashimi-lover.

For the rolls, we got an Alaska roll, an Ichiban roll, and 2 Green Dragon rolls. We initially just ordered one Green Dragon, but my boyfriend loved it so much that he ordered another one for himself. If you like avocado and eel, I highly recommend the Green Dragon roll. It's buttery from the avocado and sweet from the eel sauce, but not greasy or heavy like some fried/tempura rolls are. The roll just kind of melts in your mouth in the best way.

We also got the peach jelly sake and the green tea tempura ice cream, another recommendation from my sister. The ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal.

Our bill came out to about $72 before tip. Even though this is quite expensive for 2 people, we both left stuffed (my boyfriend and I are big eaters and love sushi) and the quality of the sushi is top-notch so I personally think it has good value. This restaurant would be great for a celebration or other special occasion.

Side note: I noticed one of the reviews complained about the service. My boyfriend and I received excellent service. Our server was attentive but not annoyingly so, and really made sure we had a good experience."}
{"text":"Decide between Malaysian or Japanese. Freshest fish in Cleveland. Highly recommend spicy rolls and sashimi."}
{"text":"I like the udon noodles and sushi a lot although they are   a little bit expensive. They have various kind of food not just Japanese food."}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants in cleveland.

I like to get the alaska rolls, tuna rolls, california rolls, bak kut teh soup, tempura undon soup. but most of all i like to take people here to show off why cleveland is amazing.

The servers good and the owners are friendly, the price is reasonable and I haven't had a bad meal yet. just park across the street, i havent been towed yet.

They also have a location in Eaton but it's not anywhere near as good as this location."}
{"text":"If you're starving and on a budget, I would HIGHLY recommend this place. The portions are huge and the prices are more than reasonable. I ordered from the Malaysian menu and the dish was full of so much flavor!"}
{"text":"As a native Californian, I have keen and astute sense of what a good Asian food should taste like. I was told to come here for a meal with friends. I ordered kwe-tiaw, fish soup, rendang beef, and something else. I highly dissatisfied at this restaurant. ALL the dishes, except the kwe-tiaw are BLAND. I complained to the waiter at that time, she spoke very little english and she was not able to resolve the situation. I told her to bring the plates back to the chef and tell him to taste the food. The food lacks basic seasonings and also GROSSLY presented. 

I would not want to visit this restaurant again. Also, the waiter kept forgetting our drink order and our entrees did NOT arrive at the same time, there was like 10 mins gap in between our entrees. 

HORRIBLE SERVICE and QUALITY. WORST restaurant I've ever visiting in my LIFE! 

Tip for the owner: You may want to start listening to your customer. I did not enjoy the food neither the experience. Your staff lacks attention to details and basic communication skills. I hope that your restaurant can survive, but looking at the food quality and service, I don't think you'll last another year."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate when it comes to sushi in Cleveland. None of the gimmicky martini lists that so many sushi places try to woo you with. Decor is simple and that's all it needs to be; none of the over-the-top neon lights and fancy-dressed hostesses. Staff is authentic and genuine and a joy.

The freshest of fresh when it comes to fish and produce, they have product shipped in from NYC weekly. Amazing. Price range is very affordable, lunch for $10 including soup, salad, tea and I think about 4 different rolls of your choice. I personally love their Naruto rolls, wrapped in cucumber and a special sauce..... I don't know what the special sauce is and I will never ask but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Had the sashimi lunch special. Decent sashimi, creative plating, but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places, but the sushi at Pacific East is exceptionally good.  I didn't actually dine in to eat here because they were about to close, however I did order the west field roll to go.  My food was ready in a reasonable amount of time.  The rolls come with eight pieces of sushi which was more than enough to fill me up. The west field roll contained spicy tuna topped with lobster tail tempera and avocado.  If I lived closer then I would literally come here everyday.  I definitely consider Pacific East as one of my favorite new sushi joints."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best place for sushi in Cleveland. Pacific East offers really tasty sushi at decent prices and a very chill peaceful atmosphere. The restaurant is entirely blue with blue walls, ceiling, and carpet that gives an immediate feeling of serenity. Normal sushi rolls such as spicy tuna or california are around 4 dollars. Try the special rolls, they cost more, but they are really really tasty. Also, if you want a better deal, going for lunch is much cheaper (soup, salad, 2 rolls for 7 dollars). The service is decent, but the staff occasionally have trouble with English."}
{"text":"Yelp and fellow Yelpers, you guys really failed me this time. I found this place desperately looking for a good japanese/sushi restaurant in Cleveland and upon reading such rave reviews like \"Best sushi in Cleveland, hands down\" and \"BEST SUSHI IN THE MIDWEST\", I decided to give Pacific East a chance. 

I am definitely disappointed and little sore that you reviewers cheated me. I tried the rolls and, like most places, they cover their rolls with so much junk, you really can't even taste the fish. It taste like rice with a heap of seasoning and spices. I even ordered 2 nigiris and there is nothing to rave about. 

I'm not a sushi snob, wait... Okay, I am a sushi snob, but granted where I'm from the sushi is fresh and always delicious. Now, I'm not trying to compare apples with oranges... but Cleveland doesn't really have good sushi places.

Other than the disappointing japanese food, I actually enjoyed the Malaysian menu. The Roti Chanai is definitely worth getting and I really liked the Hot & Sour soup. Just to be fair to Pacific East, you can add a star for their better Malaysian items."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi lover, Pacific East is the place to go! All the seafood in the sushi is fresh and high quality. The prices are extremely good for how much sushi you can get! Their other food, on both the Japanese and Malaysian menu, is great too. My one complaint is the way they cook duck. It's like they just take a giant meat cleaver and chop the heck out of the cooked duck, bones and all, and you will have to chew around all the bones and cartilage for just a little duck meat. This happened the last 2 times when I ordered 2 different duck dishes. I don't like paying for a bunch of inedible duck chunks. 

The service has always been wonderful and this place is generally pretty busy, yet we have never had to wait for a table. Lots of excellent options on the menu. I will return."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Ohio. Malaysian cuisine is worth the trip alone. Been a loyal customer for over a decade now."}
{"text":"Love this place!  In particular I love the Malaysian menu.  What a treasure to have this in Cleveland.  My favorites are the prawn mee and nasi Lamak.  My Japanese attending says this is the freshest sushi in Cleveland, but I rarely order it."}
{"text":"Really great sushi, and good Malaysian food too."}
{"text":"Sushi was o.k., but the rest was not up to the mark. I ordered Chicken basil rice, and as for as the taste goes it was somewhere around 3/10.
Recommend this place only for Sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in northeast Ohio.  There is simply no better choice for sushi around."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. We came here for lunch and ordered yaki soba (with salad included) and prawn mee (with spring roll included). Both were very good and service was excellent for how busy it gets at lunch. 

Although I can see how the quality of ingredients can improve (e.g., fish patties in the prawn mee?), I was pleased that this authentic place did take care in presentation (e.g., taking off shrimp tail shells in the prawn mee) and blended authentic food with some standards. This isn't a fancy restaurant nor a fast food place, so it's perfect for a casual meal and suits Coventry well.  

I have only gotten the Japanese sushi here once or twice, where I believe the fish hadn't been that fresh nor impressive, so I have gotten Malaysian cuisine ever since.  For casual Malaysian food, this place is a nice little find."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Takoyaki & Shrimp Shumai
Two entrees: sherred duck noodles & don katsu

To begin with, the appetizers were tasty, but I've definitely had better. The sauce on the Takoyaki seemed old and dried up (as if it had not been served right away). Also, Takoyaki, from my understanding has many flakes (that's the fun of eating Takoyaki) but there was a sparse amount of toppings. 

The shrimp shumai just tasted like microwaveable shumai, nothing special. 

For the \"sherred\" duck noodles, I was very surprised to see the large portion size. However, there were very little duck pieces and more mushrooms in the noodles (I see what you're trying to do @pacific east). Noodles were kind of dry, but it was still tasty. 

Lastly, the don katsu was very mediocre as well. The portion size was pretty big, but the breading was very bad. Every time I picked up the pieces, the  fried pieces would just fall apart. It's probably due to the oil they are using, or they just don't know how to make good don katsu. I can say I've had better don Katsu at an Asian fast food restaurant. 

Overall, environment was nice and quiet and the service was just mediocre as well. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best tempura I've ever had and the udon is very good too."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, the place does smell like fish a little bit...but likely because there's probably about 50 pounds of fish on the sushi bar at any given time.  And yes, the decor leaves something to be desired.  But if you can get past that, you'll actually get some pretty good sushi.

Shuhei is my favorite sushi place in Cleveland.  I think Pacific East now comes in second place.  The fish was fresh, but I have had better quality at Shuhei.  It wasn't bad by any means, just not spectacular.  But, there are a few things about Pacific East that blew me away.

1. The sushi rolls.  I normally HATE sushi rolls.  I am a straight-up sashimi type of girl.  But the rolls here wowed me.  Instead of being overpowered by bland rice, there was a perfect balance of rice, fish, and other goodies.  This is honestly the first time I can say that I enjoyed a sushi roll.  That's saying something.

2. The portion sizes.  My boyfriend and I split the Bridge for 2.  This is what we typically order when we get sushi- he eats the nigiri and rolls, I eat the sashimi.  Works out perfectly.  Now usually when we order this dish at other establishments, we leave satisfied, but not over-stuffed.  Never, ever, have we had leftovers to take home.  Tonight we did.  Our $50 entree was easily comprised of at least 3 meals.  We could honestly probably make 4 meals out of it if we wanted to.  Again, I was completely floored.  Never have we left a sushi bar with goodies in hand!

3. The service.  Fastest service I think I have ever seen at a sushi restaurant.  Speed could be a bad thing, but not at Pacific East.  Our soup and salad were on our table about 2 minutes after we placed our order.  We hardly finished said soup and salad before our Bridge arrived on the table.  When all was said and done, we were out of the restaurant in under and hour.

All in all, I definitely think Pacific East provides one of the best deals when it comes to sushi.  Sushi lovers living on a budget should definitely keep this establishment in mind."}
{"text":"Smells somewhat fishy by the sushi bar. If you know about sushi, you'll know this is not good."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland for sushi, sashimi, rice, noodles, everything! Love the casual feel of this place and the wide variety of menu options. Be warned, on weekends it's packed, so go early or make reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"Pacific East is amazing for their diversity of southeast Asian cuisine and very decent sushi all at college student prices. The thing that sets their sushi apart from others is the amount of goodness that comes between those walls of rice: a lot. You won't get 3/5's sticky rice with your sushi roll here! You'll get the goodness. Tip: there is always a wait on Friday or Saturday nights so call ahead or order takeaway. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with some friends. It was definitely very busy. I was skeptical about how Ohio sushi would taste (I'm originally from NY), but this place did not disappoint. I ordered a specialty roll and an Alaska roll and they were both HUGE. The fish was definitely fresh. 

My one negative comment would be that service was a bit slow. It took about an hour to have our order taken, which was ok because I was catching up with friends, but if you're in a rush you might not be so happy. This was understandable because it was a busy Saturday night and our waiter had many tables to attend to. Other than that I had a great experience."}
{"text":"It is hard to decide what I want here, because it's all so good . . . and different!

It is challenging to find a restaurant in Cleveland -- make that Ohio -- that doesn't serve fries with EVERYTHING.   Asian restaurants are an obvious escape.  But this one stands above most others.  The food is fresh, delicious, filling and nourishing without being heavy, and just all around GREAT.   We love the smoothies, too.  We have been here at least a dozen times and never had a bad experience.  The food is so good (and such a refreshing break compared to the usual fare in Cleveland) that regardless of the price on the menu, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place.  Their sushi is awesome.  Their seafood udon noodles are always great.  Oh, and be sure to try their fried ice cream."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the Japanese food, but the Malaysian food is incredible. I can't believe this place is in Ohio. I've had a number of dishes, but their Nasi Goreng is hands down the best. It's better than I've had in LA or anywhere else. This is my favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Cleveland, always pretty busy and a lot better than sushi rock.  Waitstaff is helpful and always good for recommendations about the Malay food.  Roti Chanai pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Generally this is my favorite place for sushi.  Tonight the sushi rice was overcooked and gummy.   It destroyed the flavor of the sushi and made it taste like something out of a supermarket refrigerator case.   I didn't want to make a scene by asking them to do this over since i was there with my family and they were wanting to eat and leave.  Not sure if it was Sunday or they just made a bad batch.  I would assume a good chef would be able to feel a stickiness on the fingers when making the sushi.   Unimpressed this time."}
{"text":"The first thing I did when I moved to Cleveland was ask around for the best sushi places. I can't say that this is the best sushi place that I've ever had, but this is my sushi go-to in the area. They don't take reservations at peak hours, but you can call ahead to get the approximate wait time and to put your name down on the list. They do get packed during busy hours and the wait time for food is way longer than other times - I won't ding that on the review because that is somewhat expected. (Just plan accordingly and be realistic with time). I always get 2 or 3 basic rolls, which are usually under $5 each. My favorites are the spicy yellowtail, Alaska roll, and the Xmas roll. Note!!! They cut their rolls into 6 pieces, which are WAY TOO BIG. So I always request that they are cut into 8 pieces, which are then normal-sized (to me, at least). Plus, it makes me feel like I have more sushi. If you like tuna, I'd highly recommend the Toro Roll. It is a bit more pricey, but uses scrumptious pieces of fatty tuna. Bold tuna flavor, presented in a simple roll. I also recently discovered the Toro sashimi, which is cheaper, if you just want to try the fatty tuna. 

I'd also recommend their boba (or bubble tea), if you are feeling a cool, sweet pairing with your food.

I also tried the Tonkatsu ramen a while back and was not impressed. The broth was not as rich as expected. I'd definitely try it again to see if anything has changed though."}
{"text":"Me: I would like the beef...
Server: Stir fried noodles
Me: How did you know?
Server: That's what people get from that (Malaysian) menu.
And with that answer I felt very confident in my pick and it did not disappoint.  The beef was tender and flavorful, the veggies were warm but still had their crunch, and the noodles still had a chew to them...delish.   I ended up over-eating to the point that I got full and sleepy but not enough to stop me from having leftovers.  I also got a milk tea with bubbles.  I would have liked a bit more boba but was not willing to pay the $.50 charge to get more.  Overall, very tasty."}
{"text":"So pleased with this place! Yelpers have it right! Atmosphere/vibe is totally casual with diners of every age and race with and without fashion sense. Service is friendly and attentive. Food is fresh and flavorful. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend. NOTE: They have two extensive menus. We stuck with the Japanese menu and weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge variety of food on the menu. I've been coming here for years and have never had anything bad. Plus, the Coventry location is a fun people watching spot."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for sushi because its so convenient! 

Absolutely delicious menu of a variety of sushi. The lunch menu is especially great because you can get sushi and an entree if you're like me and can't decide. The price is not bad for a student budget. 

I am also a HUGE fan of their beef noodle soup (found on their thai menu). For a cold chilly night in Cleveland (which is often), you can really chow down on this. The portion is also pretty large. I often go there for dinner and can have a bowl of noodles for dinner and able to eat it for lunch the next day too. 

The only thing that stops me from going to Pacific East though is time. They are very busy. One time, I went for lunch with my boyfriend and the waitress forgot about us! In our hurry to pay and leave, we even forgot our to ask for our left-overs. 

This is a perfect spot to go if you have the time, but make sure you're not in a rush because you will feel a little strained!"}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi had this old-aged fish smell to it. I wouldn't order raw fish from this place again. 

However, Bento box, tonkatsu, or any noodle/ soups that don't have raw fish in it were all delicious."}
{"text":"Huge variety in both the Japanese AND Malaysian menus, includes items you don't find elsewhere. Our waitress was super nice, friendly, attentive, and non-intrusive. Made our dining experience very pleasant.

For appetizers, we got the roti chanai (terrific sauce but the roti is thicker than usual) and kumamoto oysters (fresh & delicious!!). 

For entrees, had the coconut fried rice and lakhsa noodle soup. Both were a lot milder in flavor than what I had at other Malay places but they were decent and large in portion. 

The restaurant decor is really cute, with an under the sea theme, and it was comfy seating. Overall, a good experience and I'll definitely come again but will ask for chilly sauce next time."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for dinner or lunch with my boyfriend whenever I'm in town. During lunch hours, the place is fairly empty, but during dinner time, be prepared to wait a couple of minutes to be seated; it's really crowded!

I'm not sure if it's because I'm from NYC but I think they give you so much food for such a low price. My boyfriend and I always get a variation of the maki combo. His favorites are the philadelphia and spicy tuna rolls. Mine is salmon. We both loveeee the ocean roll.

+1 for having green tea and red bean flavored ice cream. Try the mochi ice cream or the tempura ice cream for dessert. I personally like the mochi more, but my boyfriend swears by the mango tempura ice cream. I've tried the green tea. It's super creamy, but it's also a lot of tempura and ice creammm.

Service is really attentive and nice. If you're in town and craving authentic, go here!"}
{"text":"Really excellent restaurant with a wide variety of japanese and Malaysian cuisine. Delicious flavors, interesting and exotic food. Got a lot of food today, but found the soups to be the best! Sushi is also very fresh"}
{"text":"So they've expanded their Malaysian Cuisine... for those of you that haven't eaten a tonne of Malaysian food, it's essentially fusion cuisine from the 1500's.  A combination of Polynesian/Malay, Indian, Chinese and a bit of Arab fare, there are spices that you don't associate with Far East Asia... unless you grew up in Indonesia, Singapore or Malaysia...

So, the usual suspects are on the menu:  Roti Cennai (As in, Madras), Nasi and Mie Goreng, Rendang, Char Kwey Teow ... Hainanese Chicken Rice...  And more...

A lot of the Malaysian Standards... particularly Malay Chinese standards...  I just got back from Singapore 3 months ago, so my comparisons are still pretty accurate, I think.

So... Rendang (Beef), literally curry beef.  Too sweet for my tastes, but a good effort.  Not spicy enough -- I guess they didn't believe that I REALLY ate spicy.

Roti Cennai.  The effort was okay.  Curry was still too sweet, not enough coconut for my tastes.  Consistency was a bit clumpy for me.  The Roti was a bit more like chinese chive pancakes in consistency, rather than the flaky, doughy Roti that we know and love.

Cocunut Rice.  MMMMMMMMM.  :)

Char Kway Teow.  This was good.  Best of the things we got.  Well prepared and flavourful.  Not too oily and fresh consistency to the flat noodles.  Excellent.

If I were to put this restaurant in a place with a lot of Malay, I think it'd get a 3 from my book.  But, I think it's completely alone in Cleveland -- that might be enough to get a 4 from me!"}
{"text":"This is great Japanese food. I'm Japanese-American, and I've been to many Japanese restaurants in Los Angeles. For this price range, Pacific East competes. I haven't tried the Malaysian menu, so I can't comment on that. A lot of people complain about the sushi, but for the price and location, what do you expect? Out of the many times I've been here, I've never had bad service. Wait staff was polite, quick, and knowledgeable about the food. Everything I've had off of the Japanese menu has been fantastic. You can't go wrong with the tempura here, and the unagi don is one of my favorites. The rice here is so good. Whenever I miss Japanese food from home, I come here."}
{"text":"Had Pacific East again last night, and sad to say, I'm back down to a 3.   

The overall summary: 

Overall, Pac East is fine for a quick cafe fix - it's not on my list of super crave worthy stuff here in Cleveland. Also, it just really lacks the finesse of Japanese food and restaurants (and is non-Japanese owned). Going to Japan and experiencing the complexity of flavor even in small eateries has ruined me for eating here in the Midwest. 

And sad to say, the Malaysian food is typically bomb here but I had a lackluster experience last night. 

The review: 

On the plus side: Self imposed sushi ban in Cleveland is lifted slightly, so the Iso Maki roll and the Alaska roll were not bad. Still super Americanized flavors, but what can you do.

The Malaysian food is typically solid because Pac East is known to have a solid Malaysian chef, but yesterday was underwhelming and I felt pretty sad about that. Got the Laksa noodles (seafood, noodles in a slightly spicy coconut broth) and it just lacked depth of flavor. The noodles and egg were way over cooked and the egg practically disintegrated in my chopstick. The noodles weren't \"QQ\" enough (a Taiwanese phrase that describes the perfect noodle tension haha). 

As for the Japanese food, hubby got a vegetable and shrimp tempura rice bowl. I tried the broccoli tempura, which was a huge head of broccoli that was steamed (??) then fried in tempura batter. The dipping sauce didn't have a strong enough flavor either (prefer more shredded radish). 

Overall, Pac East is fine for a quick cafe fix - it's not on my list of super crave worthy stuff here in Cleveland. Also, it just really lacks the finesse of Japanese food and restaurants (and is non-Japanese owned). Going to Japan and experiencing the complexity of flavor even in small eateries has ruined me for eating here in the Midwest."}
{"text":"Sushi was absolutely awesome, very fresh and very good. We had a party of 6 and tried different sushi's and everything was a home run!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago, my friend Danielle and I would come here quite often.  We would order a bottle of sake, a couple large Sopporos a piece, and a truckload of sushi to help the alcohol go down.  Well, actually she was a wimp and ordered teriyaki instead, but still the food and atmosphere of this place, half a block from the college sports bars, is quite good.  

I have not tried enough sushi in Cleveland to know if this is the best because, quite frankly, getting sushi so far away from the Pacific Ocean scares me.  And, it is difficult to give out five stars for sushi when one has lived in San Francisco for so long.  However, this is definitely worth a visit, and you should not be ashamed to take people here that live on the west coast."}
{"text":"Delicious. So delicious. Get the Roti Chanai. Every bite was perfection."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their lunch specials! Luckily, their lunch specials run from Monday to Saturday until 3pm :) 

My favorite dishes to get from the lunch special menu include: hot and spicy beef noodles, savory herb beef noodles, and tonkatsu. 
- I absolutely love the beef noodles soups. They're so rich in flavor and keeps you warm during those cold Cleveland winters :) 
- The tonkatsu is also freakin delicious! The porks are just the right amount of crispy and their sauce is amazing! 

The servers are always very attentive and checks up on you every so often. I definitely recommend trying out this restaurant if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"came here for my first restaurant experience in cleveland. blown away by the choices. will definitely be back to try more things. ordered the laksa and the soft shell crab. portions more than enough. took things home for a second meal"}

{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this Japanese Restaurant and I was thrilled to finally try it out myself.

The sushi was very good! I got the Maki combo meal which allows you to choose 2 different maki rolls and it comes with miso soup and salad. I was so full and content I could have passed out in the booth right then and there. I wish their green tea had a bit more flavor though...and our server kept re-filling our tea even though I had taken 2 sips lol. But I guess attentiveness is a good thing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars for the awesome menu and service.  I think the food itself is more along the lines of 3 stars but I love the diverse menu and awesome Malaysian selections.  

As for the food, we started with bubble tea and the taste was just off, almost sour.  The consistency of the boba was off too, perhaps undercooked or stale.
The roti canai tasted delicious but was very thin compared to other roti canai I have enjoyed.  It should have been a bit doughier.  
The coconut rice with shrimp and scallop was tasty but had no essence of coconut.  You would expect it to be fragrant or flavorful since the rice is cooked in coconut milk but it was pretty much your standard fried rice.  
The Manhattan sushi roll was underwhelming.  Too much mayo, not enough flavor in the roll itself.  The o-toro nigiri tasted delicious but was surprisingly chewy with too much membrane.  
Service was friendly and hot tea refills were generous.
All in all this restaurant has everything I want on a Japanese/Malaysian menu.  I want to come back and try the Malaysian specialties, laksa, char kway teow, beef rendang.  I just hope they have more wow-factor than the items I tried above."}
{"text":"Pacific East doesn't have the worst sushi, but it's certainly not the best. It's pricey for what it is - fairly flaccid sushi, not too nice tasting or looking.
I came here on a Saturday night and the servers were all very confused and overwhelmed, but they had a full house so I don't really hold it against them. This is a good choice if you're in the area, but it's not worth going out of the way for it."}
{"text":"Throughout the last 5 years I have been in Cleveland, PacEast has been a consistent place to get some good food. As our CWRU shuttles stop by Coventry, it is a convenient location to get dinner, whether to celebrate a dinner, go on a date, or get some post-exam pick-me-up food.

There are two menus to choose from--either the Japanese menu, or the Malaysian. The food is good quality, delicious, and decently priced. They also give good portions! 

Some of my personal favorites are:

Appetizers: 
-Gourmet Croquettes (crispy and delicious!) or 
-Roti Canai (love the mix of flavors between the savory-sweet \"bread\" and the spiciness of the curry. Unfortunately, the curry was a little watered down the last time I came).

Entrees: 
-Oyako-don or Gyu-don (definitely one of the best value! This is rice with either chicken or beef and egg. It is flavorful, filling, and there's enough leftover for a second meal!), 
-Hokkien Mee (these are super flavorful soy-sauce noodles. I highly recommend this if you'd like to try something different!), 
-Beef Stir Fried Noodles (A classic dish. I love the chewiness of the flat noodles.)

Dessert:
-End the night with some tempura ice cream!

Overall, I really love this place, and the service is great too. I remember one time I came on a date with my BF, and they actually placed us in the side room by ourselves. I find that extremely thoughtful of them. I definitely don't come here as often anymore, but it is always a good go-to place if I ever want some good food."}
{"text":"Sashima was average . The roti was good and light crispy but the curry sauce is lacking flavor and a bit oily. The restaurant looks dirty . Service was acceptable. Price is below average. I would go back and try the uni sushi ,oyster and baked mussels . 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious, which is the important part.  The service can be a little slow sometimes, so understand that you won't be in an out super quick.  A lot of times I'll get takeout instead of going in and eating there."}
{"text":"My always go to Japanese restaurant. I get edamame, miso soup, and the green dragon roll almost every time. Also featured is a chicken udon and the spider roll. Good service and good Japanese food. Also love the chocolate mochi."}
{"text":"Pacific East is my favorite sushi restaurant in Cleveland! 
We regularly either dine in or order take out and are always so pleased! 

The only disappointing part of the meal is when we realize we are about to eat the last piece! 

We have been coming to Pacific East for a couple years now and we always stick with the 4 roll combo. We get an extra order of miso soup and salad (it usually just comes with one) and we find that amount of food is more than enough for two people. By the end of the meal we find ourselves in a blissful food coma already dreaming of our next visit... :) we love Pacific East and hope to continue going there for years to come!"}
{"text":"Tried the sushi here, it isnt even pedestrian.  Freshness is questionable and quality is definitely lacking.  Sadly I was excited to try this place because it is the only place I have found that serves ramen in Cleveland.  

The ramen is a crime upon humanity.  The \"broth\" is diluted chicken stock rather than a rich savory soy, shio, or miso base.  The \"chashu\" is a leathery  slab of meat that seems like it has been cooking for weeks.  The noodles are limp and soft  and(I know this sounds vague) lack character.  Lastly the egg is like rubber.  Hands down the worst ramen I have ever had the misfortune to look at let alone eat.

This is probably one of the top 5 worst places I have eaten in my life."}
{"text":"All good things must come to an end, and this is the end for me. Pacific East used to be my go to for sashimi - it being the most authentic sushi stand in Cleveland, albeit moderately overpriced. Fellow grad students from out of state ask me where to go for anything remotely Japanese, and I always point them to this joint in Coventry. But Pacific East has unfortunately fallen prey to the Cleveland quandary. That is to say, due to the lack of viable competition, their product no longer needs to maintain a standard. Not high standards - \"a\" standard. 

I have been visiting Pacific East for over five years. I am a regular there. Most of their wait staff know my face, remember my order. Today, instead of heading out for dinner, I went for lunch after my workout. Craving tasty protein, I ordered the sashimi lunch (the sashimi bento is a lot of food in comparison - well, a lot of rice). The waiter brings me miso soup and salad, fills my green tea. The salad is watery and plain, freezing, likely refrigerated before the lunch rush. He does not fill my tea again, which is strange for them, but I don't dock him for being busy. 

Then the nightmare arrives: a sashimi plate that literally reeks worse than the fish stands at the market. I've never smelled sashimi so terrible - especially from here. I am at first confused - could the waiter not smell it on his way over? How could they serve me something inedible? Fish shouldn't smell. Not when it is fresh and prepared well. Think of rubbery chicken that smells old, beef that gives your belly a turn. I had two pieces after coating them in tear-jerking wasabi and soy - something I never do, an insult to the chef. I spent almost $13 for brown rice and a salad that made me shiver. 

Unfortunately I'll be keeping my sashimi ventures to myself from now on. I'm horrified how far Pacific East has slipped into poor service and repulsive quality. Raw meat is not to be reckoned with - faulty preparation leads to foodborne illness. Certain predatory fish, when not prepared correctly, harbor parasites. This should be common knowledge not only to microbiology students but sashimi chefs as well. I am disappointed, and this hint of rancid fish accompanied me throughout the day. 

Why two stars and not one? Because I have a history with his place, and I am sentimental, an unfortunate character flaw. By all means, continue your visits here if you are a fan of deep-fried tempura, or the popular faux-crab California roll that seems to be a favorite among the Americanos keeping this business afloat."}
{"text":"I've been to Pacific East several times for sushi. As someone from the east coast, I find midwestern sushi to be difficult, to say the least, but Pacific East has delivered pretty consistently.

The staff here is lovely and accommodating, and I've always been seated quickly. My boyfriend and I were quickly given water, and our food came out quickly.

I ordered two specialty rolls and a standard roll, and he had the tempura chicken platter, which came with some tempura-coated vegetables. My sushi was very good. By my standards, not amazing, but still very good. The vegetable tempura was cooked fantastically, and was good in both the house sauce and my soy sauce-wasabi mixture.

I will absolutely return here again and again.

And just to round out the review, I also had Pacific East cater a sushi dinner, and it was absolutely fantastic. They delivered, and their pricing was very reasonable. The food was, of course, delicious."}
{"text":"I've heard several people raving about this place so we had to check it out. We came on a Friday night and all five of us really enjoyed ourselves! The little protein bar where you can watch them making your food is really cool, and all of the staff members were friendly and attentive. I was overwhelmed by the two extensive menus however. Both the Japanese and Malaysian menus were several pages of dense stuff with no photos. (I like menu photos so I know what I'm getting if I don't understand the titles and descriptions) Luckily my friends helped me work through the menu and I decided on sushi rolls. 

Their Golden Dream Roll, with fresh mango on top, was really delicious! (Especially since I hadn't had a fresh mango in months) The beef udon on of my fiends got was gigantic and smelled really good. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I had never been here, but a group of about 20 of us decided to get a late dinner here after a movie on the CWRU campus. We called ahead by about half an hour and they were ready to seat us when we arrived. The service was prompt and unobtrusive and we were able to enjoy a leisurely dinner (the restaurant is open until 2 I believe, though the kitchen closes earlier).

I have a shrimp allergy, and the staff was sensitive to this and assured me that it wouldn't be a problem (a courtesy I have unfortunately not always been afforded at other sushi restaurants). My meal was pretty good, but the spicy salmon roll wasn't really all that spicy.

However the star of the meal was stage sushi bridge (intended for 2, but shared by 3 of my friends who still ended up taking some home)! It was beautifully presented and according to the friends who split it, the sushi was amazing. They also included a comically large ball of wasabi that we all enjoyed marveling at.

All in all this was a great experience, and I'll definitely be back to try some of the non-sushi offerings."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I highly recommend the sushi. Love the shrimp tempura and spicy yellowtail roll. The rolls are large I can only eat one. Ps. The Uni is to die for!"}
{"text":"All of the Pacific East locations have *excellent* sushi. I think it's one of the best sushi restaurants in the Cleveland area, and it's reasonably priced for sushi. The seaweed salad is pretty good as well. The miso soup is average, as you'd get at any Japanese restaurant. Make a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I must say this is a huge size for the regular sushi roll. The spider roll has a big piece of soft shell crab inside,that surprised me. Good quality for the reasonable price,it would be perfect if they put more eel sauce on the top of the eel or the tempura rolls."}
{"text":"Have been here before and really enjoyed it.  But recently had a late lunch on a Saturday (3pm) and the sushi was really poor.  I had the sashimi lunch (9 pcs sashimi, miso soup, salad) and 5 pcs were fine; the remaining 4 were bad / I left them uneaten.  Was thinking since it was early in the day; perhaps the fish wasn't as fresh due to being leftover from the day before?).  My girl's sushi / roll was similarly unappetizing.  We were both pretty disappointed; a surprisingly poor meal from a place we've really liked in the past."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and only average food. Even the manager would not come when we asked to see  him. (A young man was our waiter (one caveat, a young lady name Moon did help us despite not being our server) I Ordered green tea that was never delivered. The green dragon roll was only as good as supermarket sushi. The mango tofu was more of a glaze than a a sauce. Gave two stars because it had been good in the past."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the best authentic food around the Coventry area for sushi and Malaysian food. The ingredients are fresh and you can actually taste it. I came here with a couple of friends before and haven't really written a review  until I went back recently and tried their Prawn Mee soup. 

This was hella (excuse my North Cal slang) excellent. Even though it didn't come with prawns as the picture but it had the prawn taste to it. Plenty of shrimp and noodles, this hit the spot especially on a rainy day like yesterday. I came here with a friend and we also ordered their spider roll and it was plenty (they pack their food big here). My friend ordered their beef noodle stir fry which tasted great as well. Like other places I've tried, this was the best. The noodles weren't soggy and there was plenty of food for just the 2 of us. 

The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The place was getting busy around dinner service around 6-8pm and I'm not sure what their hours are on Sunday but if a place still gets busy around 8, they are doing something right. The only downside of this is that parking is metered so make sure you bring plenty of quarters!"}
{"text":"The sushi was awesome, I got two rolls, one called The Bomb and the other had eel, I forget the name. Both delicious. We also got some Malaysian dishes and Tonkatsu. Everything was very good. The waitress was nice and food came fast. Only thing is the room we sat in didn't have a great atmosphere compared to the other room and the sun was pretty bright. It'd be cool if they fixed up that room a little."}
{"text":"Just when I thought that it couldn't get any better!   We usually frequent the Pacific East on Chagrin in Woodmere, but this past Saturday, the restaurant was closed:-(.  I like this location because it's close to home, the sushi is always fresh and you can't beat the price.  My daughter and I really had our heart set on sushi from Pacific East, so we ventured to the Coventry location and I'm glad that we did!  I thought the Coventry location was even better.  We normally opt for the dinner combo at the Woodmere location, which includes house salad with ginger dressing, miso soup (we substitute the shitake mushroom soup for a slight upcharge) and 1, 2 or 3 rolls of your choice.   Very happy that the same special was offered at Coventry.  The salad was fresh and well dressed.  The mushroom soup (I crave this soup), was even better here, nice broth full of charred onions, garlic, mushroom and a wedge of lemon and I opted for the shrimp tempura roll and California roll.  My daughter ordered the tuna and California.  We were both very pleased with our meals.  The staff was super nice and very accomodating.   I will definitely re-visit this location.....soon!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles the last 5 1/2 years, I'm definitely spoiled when it comes to excellent sushi. This location doesn't disappoint with their quality fish and sushi. I just wish they stayed open later. Good place!"}
{"text":"I've recently fallen in love with the Oyster Omelette on the Malaysian appetizer menu. Yum, yum, YUM!  It takes longer to prepare than other dishes, but well worth the wait.  Oysters are perfectly tender and juicy, the eggs firm, moist & flavorful with sweet potato flour (according to the menu) and I'm guessing a splash of coconut milk?   Sauteed carrot and onion fold in a hint of crunch; cucumber slices, cilantro sprigs and sweet/sour dipping sauce round out this unique flavor palette!  Meal-sized and reasonably priced.

I love finding restaurant dishes I'm unable or unlikely to make at home.  This definitely fills the bill.  Everything I've eaten here has had attention to subtle and complex flavors.  My tastebuds vote a consistent 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for work and decided to try Pacific East.  I ordered suimono soup ( mushroom seaweed soup) which was pretty good (not amazing) and Manhattan roll ( which had shrimp, avocado, and lobster sauce).  The roll was good but the lobster sauce was really rich and I had to scrape some of the sauce off towards the end. Waiter service was slow but not horrible and I got there early on a weekday and by the time I left the place was really filling up.  I was very impressed with the prices.  I also liked that you could choose Japanese or Malaysian dishes.  I gave the place 3 stars because parking (I had to park down the street and on a side street) and service speed was lacking. But I would recommend the restaurant and would go back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Japanese/Indonesian Restaurant in Cleveland. I usually go for Japanese, it's light, clean and tastes amazingly close to food in Tokyo! I've been there for more than five times and I have never been disappointed once. I've never sat in, I just do takeouts and I've never waited for more than 15 minutes even when the restaurant was pretty busy. The staff is very polite, typical Japanese hospitality, and very helpful when you need to know more about what's in the menu."}
{"text":"Boorring!

I stopped in on Saturday for some lunch, and Udon noodles were just under what I would call \"meh.\" First of all, the menu indicates the Udon soup will have vegetables in it. What their actually was, was one small piece of broccoli, one carrot wedge, and a whole crapdone of boring, not good onion slices. That was it.

As for the quantity of beef in my udon, I would say that it was fair, but the actual quality of the Udon, and CERTAINLY the quality of the broth sucked. 

Bottom line is, for being in Coventry, you can get better noodle soup, or just a better meal. 

The staff were fine, and the place is clean and it takes credit, but I wouldn't recommend the Udon on my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Went to Pacific East recently with a friend for the second time after about two years, because I wasn't the biggest fan the last time I went. I have to say that my most recent experience was very pleasant; our waitress was gracious and funny, and the value of the food was relatively unmatched for the Coventry area. The sushi was a few bars above average; I had a spicy tuna roll, and a shrimp tempura roll, but for the prices and speed of service, this place is a great place to grab a quick dinner. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland...period.

I've had sushi in many different cities and in many different restaurants. Pacific East is definitely at the top.

The staff is friendly and warm, the decor is serene and the food is top-notch. They have a big selection of rolls as well as everything else. They will even provide you with the necessary tools to do a real saki bomb... I've pounded many a table there ;)  But really, the sushi is so good, you will dream about it. The huge plump shrimps in the tempura roll are crispy and warm and the tuna is like butter. No bones in this sushi! ...can't say the same for Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"honestly, i can't say much about the sushi here bc i don't eat much of it.
but the malaysian food is delicious! i've never really had much malaysian food so i can't attest to the authenticity, but it tastes like the best mix of chinese, thai and viet. some of my favorite items on the menu are....
salt and pepper king oyster mushrooms and tofu.
satay tofu.
curry noodles with tofu
vegetarian tofu clay pot.

not that i eat a lot of tofu or anything........ but if you want tofu, this is the place to get it! great place for vegetarians and vegans!"}
{"text":"One of the better Asian places on the East side! They have great sushi and soups! TONS of options for vegetarians and vegans and they're always willing to make substitutions to make something veg friendly. Friday and Saturday nights are always crazy busy, but you can usually get a table in 25 minutes or less."}
{"text":"Pacific East is a very down to earth, humble, and traditional japanese restaurant that serves up great quality raw fish. They use authentic japanese ingredients, and it really shines through their food. Priced at about $1-2 more than your usual run-in japanese bar is completely justified by top notch raw fish. 
Pacific.E is a great japanese restaurant for those who appreciate high quality, but humble japanese cuisine.
If they would only stay true to their japanese-focused roots (rather than try and satisfy a vaster Cleveland crowd with a huge multi-ethnical menus) and fine-tune a bit of their kitchen food, this place would absolutely be \"As good as it get's\"

--last minute tips--
-I highly recommend their unagi (eel)
as well as any of their Toro sushi's (fatty tuna)
-Their hamachi kama is a GREAT choice for those who do not eat raw fish, but love simple delicious fresh fish
-all in, you can't go wrong with sushi/sashimi/maki rolls
-their Malaysian menu is so-so, nothing that wow-ed

Food: B+
Atmosphere: B
Service: B+"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places, if not the best place, to get sushi in Cleveland. It's been my consistent experience that the fish is fresh--near perfect--and the craft is solid. It also happens to be a pretty good value for money.

There are a lot of reviews here casting a negative light on Pacific East relative to restaurants in U.S. costal cities (NY, CA, etc.). I've had sushi in Tokyo, Kyoto, NY, SF, Chicago, and many other American cities.  I've had both stellar and less than impressive sushi in all these places.  (Well, not Kyoto--I must admit that everything I've eaten in Kyoto has been near-perfect.)  The fact is that the sushi at Pacific East is good by any standard. As fresh as you get in Tokyo straight that morning from Tsukiji?  Of course not.  But about as close as you can get given the ship-to location.  The people at Pacific East love what they do, and they're good at it.  

Anyone who bashes this place with one or two stars is either (a) an ignorant poseur or (b) a lying poseur.  People love to jump on the 'you can't get good sushi in Cleveland' bandwagon, in a lame attempt at geographical and/or culinary superiority.  To all the reviewers in this category: You have exposed yourselves as fakes.  You apparently taste your food with a map instead of your tongue.

And by the way, the smell inside Pacific East (on which some like to comment) is more nori than fish, since many of you obviously have trouble telling the difference.

In short, relax and enjoy the food.  It's hard to go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"I think they have the best quality sushi in all of Cleveland, at least near the CWRU campus, I usually get the Maki Combo, where you get Salad, miso soup, and 2-4 rolls of sushi. I definitely love the Ocean roll. The Tri-color Nigiri was very good as well. I really wish I could have sampled every one of their a la carte items, and I think one of these days I will."}
{"text":"I love sushi, so I was pretty excited when we were ordering delivery from SkipTheDishes one night and discovered they had recently joined the service.  Delivery sushi does sound pretty exciting, right?  I'd had some of their sushi from the Eton location at a catered event once and enjoyed it, so I figured we'd had similar luck with the original location, but we were disappointed with what we ended up with.

My husband said the seaweed salad and California roll were all right.  My yellowtail roll was quite good, but that concludes the list of things we enjoyed from the meal.  The miso soup was okay, but I've had much better.  The spicy rolls had so much mayo in them there were basically inedible, and he found a fish bone in one of his.  I had a shrimp tempura roll that had potential-- the shrimp itself tasted great-- but it was assembled poorly so every slice fell apart when I tried to eat it.  The equivalent roll from the sushi counter at Whole Foods is better, and it's not like Whole Foods has a standout sushi chef.

Maybe I'll try something from the Malaysian side of the kitchen one day, but I'm not anxious to try their sushi or Japanese again anytime soon when we've had consistently great experiences at our regular spot."}
{"text":"It's been a looooonngg time since I've been here that it was practically my first time. Came here with a few friends for sushi, and sushi was all we had... although I did start with a bowl of their shiitake mushroom soup. Yummy! We ordered a boat and a couple of extra hand rolls - one was a jumbo spider roll, and jumbo it was. Overall, the sushi was good and fresh - well prepared and well presented. Servers were friendly and attentive. My only tiff is the space seemed really cramped. Tables were too close to each other. Makes it very hard to have intimate conversations.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised that they serve Malaysian cuisine. Only came for sushi on this visit, so I'll definitely be back to try their Malaysian menu for another review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend could eat here everyday if he could, he loves their sushi. I come here about once every other week because of him! I do love the meal I get though. I get the chicken teryaki; it is so yummy! My dinner starts off with a crispy salad with some sort of dressing on top... I do not know what kind of dressing it but it's good. My meal also comes with rice, I get white rice and oh boy is it yummy! They cook it so perfectly, I hate when my rice is hard!! Anyways, last time I was there I noticed that a lot of people were drinking out of a cute cup, so I asked the waitress what it was. Apparently you get complimentary green tea! So of course I took up the offer ;) Overall I enjoy this place very much! It is very cute and I love the chicken (although my boyfriend loves the sushi a lot more than I love my meal!! lol)"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! It was extremely fresh! The rolls were huge and stuffed with fish, not veggies. Even the miso soup and ginger dressing on the salad were fresh and very good. 

The service was fast and courteous with just the right amount of attention without being a burden. 

Their menu is unbelievable. Not only is their sushi menu enormous, they have another full menu full of Malaysian food! We will have to go back many times to try everything."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious. We had the spider roll and it was massive. I'm not entirely sure how you are supposed to eat it because it's like three bites per piece as opposed to normal bite size sushi. But it was so good. 
I had the seafood mango fried rice. It was good but a little bland. My husband had the pork tonkatsu ramen. It was okay. Not enough pork all noodles.
The portion sizes are massive. I will probably get three meals out of my fried rice and the ramen will be at least two meal. Lots of leftovers. 
The service wasn't great. Our waiter took our order and dropped off our food. We didn't see him besides that. Another employee brought us our check but not until ten minutes after we were done eating. 
Overall I would probably go back if we were local but since we aren't we likely will not make the 30 minute drive for this place specifically. We were seeing a show nearby so at the time it was convenient."}
{"text":"Pacific East is quite possibly the best sushi I've had in Cleveland. My roommate and I visited here and ordered one appetizer to share and 7 rolls of sushi which we shared. Both of us have large appetites and were quite hungry that day. I'm happy to say that we were extremely satisfied with the quality of the sushi and the quantity. The presentation was artistic and quite beautiful. We had 6 pieces of sushi left over at the end and were stuffed. The service was prompt and polite, the food was delivered to the table in a fair amount of time. I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant and will have to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Sushi is very fresh and the people are always nice they're one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a girls night with my bestie, So Good!! Japanese and Malaysian cuisine under 1 roof! Fantastic service, large choice of menu options, casual chill spot, and delicious food! We got coconut fried rice with seafood, hainanese chicken with chicken stock rice, spider roll, and spicy tuna roll!! They can make anything gluten free and even had gluten free soy sauce! I want to move in! Lol!! Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"How can one tell if sushi is the real deal and fresh? For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

...as for Malaysian food in a Japanese restaurant, sigh, why? OK, nothing wrong with that, but I have a thing about restaurant \"purity of theme\"."}
{"text":"I decided to play it safe and ordered my staple, a spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll, and I will definitely be coming back to venture a little deeper into their menu. 

The rolls were: massive and fresh. I'm sure the sushi critiques would deduct points because their rolls don't easily fit into ones mouth, but for me I liked their sushi. It's not the most delicate or beautiful sushi I've ever had, but when hungry and craving sushi Pacific East seems like a delicious, economical and logical choice.

I really enjoyed the ginger dressing on the salad. The miso soup was on point as well. The house hot sake was very drinkable, although I know nothing about sake.

This restaurant is very reasonably priced. Service was really good, in fact the 5 different waitresses circling around our table to get our drink order and food order reminded me of a pack of sharks, a pack of very sweet and polite sharks. Do they work on commission here or something? 

The surrounding area is very cute as well. I'm excited to go back and try their Malaysian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Went to Pacific East for lunch on a Friday around noon. It wasn't particularly busy at that time, so we were seated right away. I ordered one of the lunch specials, which included 3 maki rolls, salad and soup for 12 bucks. Pretty good deal... The food was delicious and the service was timely and friendly.

A lot of locals claim Pacific East to be the best sushi on the east side - maybe in the entire Cleveland area. Personally, I think Ariyoshi a mile down the street on Lee Road takes the cake. The quality at Ariyoshi is at least as good as at Pacific East, and the prices even better. 

Go to Pacific East, it's a very good sushi restaurant, it's just not the 'best'."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and ratings, and how much I was craving sushi that day, I was for sure excited to try this place out. We were nervous to have to find street parking, but thankfully there was a garage just down the street. For a popular restaurant (and during dinner hours) we thought we'd have to wait a while for a seat to open up. We actually only waited about 5-10 minutes to be seated.

When we were ready to order, we were warned that there is currently a 45 minute wait for all sushi entrees to be served... so we said ok fine, but in my mind I'm saying \"wow this better be worth the wait because I don't know if my stomach can wait 45 minutes\". Anyway, after about an hour or what seemed like forever we finally got our food and I have to admit there's only a few places that I'd wait 45 min. to an 1 hour for sushi to be served to me... and this might be one of them. Every dish we ordered tasted so fresh. I had no complaints.

I looked over the other food options they offered and there were PLENTY of options. Seriously, if I wasn't in the mood for sushi, I'd have a hard time choosing what to eat. I also had no complaints with their service, our waiter was pretty attentive. One minor complaint was how uneven our table was since it rocked back-and-forth. 

Anyway, definitely try this place out if you're in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Pacific East. Great sushi and service. While the kids love the genuine raw versions, I am grateful for the cooked choices they offer to those of us who cannot tolerate raw. The giant spider roll is wonderful."}
{"text":"This was the freshest sushi i've had in Ohio!  I also LOVE their lunch specials.  You can't go wrong with any of them... and there are a LOT of them.  From laksa soup noodles to beef rendang to sambal morning glory to hainan chicken, it's all so good!  The soup noodles are full sized portions at lunch at a lower price and includes soup or salad and a vegetable spring roll.  The menu is extensive.  There are actually 2 separate ones that are both equally long.  You can find something for everyone here, and it's never hard to find a table. Service is decent, and you can also do take out."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi fixes. It's one of the best (if not the best) in the Cleveland area. I have tried many sushi places and I think to myself, \"should have gone to Pacific East...\"

The restaurant's prices are fair for a sushi place and their sashimi selection is better than most. Best of all, they usually have toro (fatty tuna) as one of their choices! If you haven't had toro, try it as a sashimi and you probably won't want to eat any other kind of sashimi. There are three kinds of toro here, you can get the toro (fatty), chu-toro (fatter), or o-toro (fattest). These all literally melts in your mouth! They have good flavor (no fishy taste at all) and a very smooth texture. The only complaint is that its about $7-8 for an order (2 pcs) for the o-toro (toro and chu toro is a bit cheaper). Their sake salmon sashimi is also a safe bet. 

I also enjoy their sushi. Their spider roll is great and can't really go wrong with it. It's served warm and the crab is crispy and often times meaty. The rolls are well made with just the right amount of rice. The ocean roll also gets ordered quite often. It's a sushi roll with deep fried oysters. I don't think I've seen this roll at other sushi places, so its definitely worth it to try it out while you're here.

TIP: metered street parking around Coventry is FREE after 6PM weekdays and free on the weekends. If you can't find any free parking, use the parking lot by Marcs."}
{"text":"Nothing like a Malaysian hotpot or noodle dish on a cold Cleveland night. CURRY BEEF NOODLE and FISH AND TOFU are among our favorites! Served steaming hot and stays hot through the whole meal. Thanks again for another delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Sweet potato roll was literally heaven. The squash roll was a surprising delight as well! Overall I really enjoyed this place. I just have a few issues that dropped it down a couple notches for me:

1. The edamame appetizer was noticeably old. Now, I'm not talking like DAYS past due, but you could tell it wasn't fresh.
2. The service was pretty slow. A lot of people actually ended up leaving their tables and walking out because it was taking so long. I'm not an asshole so I stuck it out but I think it's relevant to mention in any review. So if you are in a rush, maybe go somewhere else.
3. I never thought I would complain about my sushi being TOO big, but my sweet potato roll was cut into such large pieces it was very hard to enjoy. When you're about to choke on potato it's hard to relish the flavor of the food.  

Like I said though, the food really was enjoyable but it just didn't seem like my experience earned more than 3/5."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers one of the best sushi you can get in Cleveland since rest of the Japanese restaurants can hardly reach 1 Star. Sushi from Pacific East used to be better and something has happened to this restaurant in the past few years. They must have changed the owner, chefs or simply decided to go americanized. Rolls and Nigiri used to be smaller in size and fish quality were better. Now they are bigger and mush less quality. Rice is not well seasoned by rice vinegar. The packed sushi rolls from Whole Foods are better quality in fish and rice. 
The other day as we were walking on Coventry with a box of left over from Pacific East, a lady asked me how I liked their food. She also feels that their quality had gone worse and is not going back there again although her friends have not noticed the difference and still like the food. I personally miss their quality back in a days.

Yes, it is official.
After writing the review above, I went back to eat at this place again.
I ordered some rolls, salmon, hamachi and Shrimp Tempura.
The salmon does not taste like anything, completely no fish taste.
Hamachi was blah again, no intense taste of the ocean.
Shrimp Tempura were of course very very yummy, because they are battered and dizzeled with sauce. 
Each rolls are loose because of rice is runny. Veru sad.

I miss the old days at Pacific East..."}
{"text":"The melange of opinions might leave one thinking that Pacific East is inconsistent in its quality. Let me defend them by saying that 1) I've had quite a bit of sushi in my life, 2) I've had quite a bit of Pacific East sushi in the past four years, certainly 15+ times in the past four years. Without hesitation I recommend them to any sushi lover on the east side.

Probably the best compliment I can pay it is that my wife, who is a sushi snob, sends me here whenever she wants a culinary treat. I've also had several of their stir fries and soups, and have never once been disappointed.

The servers are attentive and have always kindly taken the time to answer our questions about ingredients, since wheat and sesame allergies exist in my family. Like others have mentioned, the menu is a bit overwhelming since they serve such a huge variety of food and the service can be slow at peak hours. But all together, 4.5 / 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi for a good price. Especially their lunch specials. I always forget how big their rolls are, but I can fill up on the 2 roll lunch special - 3 rolls is definitely too much since it comes with a salad and miso soup too. Everything I've had is really good. Pacific east is definitely my go-to for sushi in Cleveland. I really like the giant eel roll! They also have a menu of Malaysian food, but I've never ordered from that. 

It can get crowded at dinner time and weekends, but they do take reservations, which you should definitely make if you have a larger party. Service is okay, the staff are respectful, but they definitely don't go out of their way to be nice. Parking can also all metered on Coventry and in the parking garage. You can park on side streets for free, just be sure to check the signs so you don't get a ticket!"}
{"text":"Went at 3:00 pm when they opened today, even at that time there was a short line to get in.  Very efficient and attentive service.  Portions are huge, even the Chicken Satay was twice the size that you get at other places.  We left with three boxes of leftovers.  Wife and daughter tried the Chicken and Vegetables Tempura, with the included miso soup and salad they could have easily split one entrée.  We also received complimentary hot tea.

My only quibble was with the bone-in Hainanese Chicken.  The way that they saw up the chicken pieces leaves you with a lot of short, sharp bones to deal with.  I'm used to the Singapore style with boneless sliced breast meat.  The chicken rice that came with it was excellent, but why do they give you TWO bowls of it when it's supposed to be a small serving?"}
{"text":"Odd experience with this place- when there's a crowd, the food quality dips. So does the service. The waitress once brought out our appetizers about 15 min after the main course; she didn't seem to know the order of food service. You can rarely mess up nasi goreng, but these folks have goofed this up too. Roti chanai and their curry puff is pretty good."}
{"text":"I live close to Pacific East, so I frequent this place whenever I crave sushi (which is often). Their standard spicy tuna and Alaska roll, two of my faves, are pretty decent. :) Fairly priced as well. Not the BEST sushi I've ever had, but definitely good enough to satisfy my craving. Sometimes, the sushi comes with wayy too much rice and relatively a small amount of fresh fish, but it's usually not enough to bother me. 

Something unique about Pacific East that I adore is that you can get Malaysian here! If you're new to Malaysian or need recommendations, the Roti Chanai is my favorite appetizer, and the Laksa is superb."}
{"text":"This place is definitely way overrated. The sushi did not taste that fresh and overall the flavors were lacking. Being Cleveland, the prices were more reasonable than other cities. However, I would say that even Ann Arbor has much better sushi than this establishment.

I ordered a basic set of rolls: spicy tuna (2/5), salmon avocado (3.5/5), eel (2/5), shrimp tempura (3.5/5). Everything was okay except the tuna and eel which just were not good. We left the spicy tuna on the dish. 

Overall, does not live up to the hype. Would not return."}
{"text":"They used to be much better. They are really becoming sloppy with the food , and the customer service is not good. Very dry  and a but rude.

3 out of the 6 pieces of nigiri weren't edible. One had too much skin, the other would endlessly chew, and the third-well i dont know how to describe it.
When we tried to tell the waiter, his immediate reaction was to ask us if we had sushi before, and he completely dismissed us. Told us we could tell the owner.


This is definitely the last time we come here."}
{"text":"We ordered the sushi boat for 4 people.  It was OK.   But, it was so hot and stuffy in the restaurant.  The waitress was good.  They told us it would be a 15 minute wait, but the wait was much longer.  It was more like 45 minutes.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"It was very good. I had the miso soup, field green salad and the ocean roll; delish! I will definitely be going back to try something else."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Sushi. Always delicious and the lunch menus are a great value for what you receive! Soup, salad, tea and two sushi rolls for 8.95! I love their Alaskan and Spicy Tuna Rolls best. Their hours are just a tad limited depending on the day of the week, so be sure you check to make sure they're open before you drive out. Overall great!"}
{"text":"Stars: 4   

Pros: 
The sushi is probably the best I have tasted in Cleveland. That said, it is Cleveland standards =P. The fish tastes fresh, which I have to mentioned because other resturants in the area do not even get that right. 

The roti for an appetizer is good, however, it does not always come crispy and fluffy, the way it should be, imho.

The beef rendang is tasty (I wish I tried the lamb rendang) and comes in a good big portion. An extra bowl of rice is 1.50...i remember the days when every resturant used to provide free bowls of rice, sigh.

Make sure to try their seafood and crispy noodle bowl dish. I cannot remember the name, but if you describe it to them that way, they'll point you to the right direction on the menu. This is one of my favorite dishes here!

The service, I have to say, is phenomenal. Phenomenal. Why? Because when you ask them for something, the immediately do that for you. Extra bowl of rice, a fork for a friend who cant use chopsticks, you name it.  They are always nice and come around to fill your water constantly (which makes getting their attention for a request that much easier).

Cons:
Sushi is expensive...sigh. Especially when you are hungry. Fortunately, every other non-sushi item is not.

Certain rolls are not very good no matter where you get them...you cant call something that has more cream cheese than fish by weight in their roll, sushi. =D"}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI IN THE MIDWEST

I am not from cleveland, and I have tried sushi everywhere I go, and this is the best. An old friend of mine brought me here and told me to forget about everything I knew about the hot spots in Chicago, this will blow your mind.

He went on to explain the reason why it's so good....because the owner is the head chef/sushi master.  He ensures quality as every sushi order goes out.  That says alot to me.  It take more than decade to become a sushi master, where as most places have barely trained people making it, and usually they start off strong, but after a while there is decline in quality.  This place has safe guarded their quality and locked in satisfaction.

Try everything, its all amazing, service is great, prices are very cheap, located in a very nice area.

I can't wait to go back again, and again

ps. they have malaysian food as well"}
{"text":"Super speedy lunch makes this a solid 3.5, but I'll be nice and round it up to 4.

I stopped in for a quick bite when I had 30 minutes of free time before a hair appointment down the street. I thought I was going to have a take-out, but they have a little mini bar where you can sit and watch your sushi being made. 

I have the say the quality has improved. Last time I stopped the sushi was not very good--this time was 100% better! I don't know what's changed, but it's better all around. My two rolls were up in a just a few minutes and I didn't realize it came with soup and a salad. All around a solid lunch and I took the 2nd roll home. 

Recommended if you're on the east side, still not as good as Ginko, but a hella lot cheaper and very darn tasty. 

They also seem to have added a bar area on the other side of the restaurant? Or maybe I just never paid attention. It's one of those things..."}
{"text":"I found this place on line from all of the good reviews here on yelp.  And its true.  I live in LA and eat sushi all the time, yet the Sashimi here was some of the best i have ever had!!!! There service was amazing and my server Megumi was so sweet.  She totally recommended some chef special sushi and I am so happy i listened! Yum.  I have been dreaming about returning.  So good!"}
{"text":"People from all over the country would ask me where this place was when I worked the front desk at a downtown tourist attraction. I figured I had to try it. I am not a huge sushi person, but I really enjoyed the sushi I have ordered here. I would come again."}
{"text":"Love their food. This is some of the best sushi in Cleveland. I love the nasi goreng, and duck dishes, and the tea is a great addition. My only real disappointment has been trying to order by phone, I rarely get anyone to answer."}
{"text":"Good prices...
Ordered XO Fried rice and it was good.Also Ocean Roll and added fried Eel.
Lamb Rendang with rice is amazing!
Combination Satay is too good to be true!
Service was pretty slow every time I went and its always really crowded so get there early."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland, hands down.  Any time I come back to Cleveland, I have to get my Pacific East fix.  Several years ago, I lived almost directly above this place and I now realize how good I had it.  I have been to their other two locations (much closer for me) but nothing beats the original.

I usually keep in pretty simple with a 2 roll maki combo.  You can't beat the price and the taste is to die for.  I love their ginger salad dressing their miso is tasty.  Their standard rolls are anything but..they are quite large compared to other sushi places and always delicious.  The spicy crab roll is the stuff that dreams are made of.

Living in Chicago now, there is a sushi place on every corner.  Still nothing compares to Pacific East."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years and I have to say that Pacific East is definitely the best sushi restaurant in the Cleveland area. Generous portions of fish on the nigiri and sashimi, served like it is in Japan. Having recently come back from Tokyo, I was actually surprised to find legit offerings at Pacific East like real red snapper, uni, botan ebi, amaebi and o-toro at a very reasonable price. They are understaffed and service can be a little slow during peak hours, but the quality of the sushi was comparable to much more expensive omakase places in NYC."}
{"text":"dropped in for a quick dinner and sat at the sushi bar. the sushi was of excellent quality - some of the best i've had in cleveland. i just wish they'd do the pieces a bit on the smaller side. i'm not a fan of the two bite nigiri. they also have a pretty extensive malaysian menu which is tempting, but we need to go back with another couple so we can order a lot of different things. important note: prices are very fair... yay!"}
{"text":"not very good japanese food.
smelly.
pricy.
meh!"}
{"text":"How have I not written my review of this place, which has now become my go-to for sushi?

Great food, great service.  Have not tried anything I didn't like.  They have had toro every time I have gone, and it is excellent.

I have been a long-time customer of Shuhei, and while I still visit on occasion, Pacific East is the best sushi on the east side, IMO."}
{"text":"Being Malaysian, I get extremely excited anytime I stumble upon Malaysian cuisine in the Midwest. I was feeling extremely homesick when me and my boyfriend came across this restaurant and we were not disappointed. The roti canai was deliciousssss. Authentic and the curry that accompanied it equally good. For entrees we shared the nasi lemak and char koay teow. Koay teow was very good. Nasi lemak hit slightly below the mark for me but was still great. Overall, great prices, delicious food and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great sushi quality & reeeally lacking any ambiance. I actually feel a bit depressed eating there. Make it young and hip like the rest of Coventry!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pac-E. However, YMMV as I always get the volcano roll, spicy sushi roll, and some sort of beverage.

Okay prices if you are not ordering top-of-the-line sushi. Veggie rolls are only a few bucks.

Beware: usually busy around dinner time. Waited 20-30 minutes once. Otherwise, all is well."}
{"text":"Salmon sushi had something crunchy in it. The sushi was also falling apart when I picked it up. The service was also slow and no one was in the restaurant. Plus they charged me for the wrong meal and had to void it off my card."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service was terrible. Had to get up and ask to be served and then had to get up and ask for a box and the check. Very torn on whether to come back or not. Definitely take out but I wouldn't want to sit down and eat again."}
{"text":"Visiting from NW and our son and his wife took us here. They warned us that they have a expansive menu, which was very true.  They actually gave us two separate menus, which made decisions difficult.  
I had the tonkatshu which was perfectly cooked.  My wife had the sukiyaki with beef and just melted in your mouth!  The size and portions were just right for price. 
Highly recommend and come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Usually when you see an Asian restaurant that has every type of asian continent's food, the first thing you think is that this place must suck at every dish because it's probably not authentic.

WRONG!!!! Pacific east is delicious! My friend and I come here for an usual date not and we love it! She orders her own version of Sushi while I switch around my orders between... Seafood Udon, Seafood & Tofu Hot Pot, Beef Stir Fried Noodles, and Roti Chanai. 

make sure you sure the seafood udon & roti chanai. The roti chanai is amazing, honestly! the curry sauce is perfect, the flat bread is soft and so good! :D 

I love this place and because it's right down my street, i'm happy there's a good restaurant around my area!"}
{"text":"Pacific East is delicious! I only get the sushi combo when I go here.  It includes a salad, soup, and sushi rolls.  It is always amazing.  The servers tend to help each other out which makes it feel like a family run business.  Sometimes the servers english isn't the best, but it doesn't matter.  They recently expanded so there is more seating!  They also have a back room which is great for small parties."}
{"text":"I am astonished at the rating for Pacific East, as was one reviewer, I don't think Pacific East deserves a 4 star rating. It's like benihana's or sushi rock, and people just think they're eating great Japanese food, from chain restaurants like this. NOTHING is authentic here, not even the staff.

well if you're looking for cheap \"japanese\" food, this is the place for you. 

But if you want GOOD authentic japanese food I'd go elsewhere.  You'll probably pay a bit more, but it'd be worth it.   I'd try Shinano's Sushi Bar and Japanese cuisine. They have great sushi, and an authentic Japanese  menu. (If you're going to PE for other food, I guess thats fine)

I got a tonkatsu dinner (pork cutler) and i think I just ate panko breading... If there was actual pork in there, I'd be surprised. I also had gotten a sashimi app. and a roll. Now the \"freshness\" of the fish is deceiving. Pretty much anywhere you go, you will be eating frozen fish, since we are in Ohio (unless you go to some really expensive place with FRESH fish). So no one can really say that they have the best \"fresh\" sushi. But I have to say the sushi rice was pretty bland, and overall didn't wow me. 

But I was pretty disgusted at the quality of my meal. 

And, along with one of the reviewers, the staff can get persistent and annoying if you're the only group dining... 

But this place isn't inedible, it's just over rated, and you'll get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good Stuff

This place just never disappoints. I was on a 2nd date and we just finished a hike, I thought  how about sushi.  I went by Zagaras to pick up a selection of sushi however they were out!  I was about to panic until my little brain realized I was 2 minutes from Pac-East!  She was a beginner with the sushi thing, so I got California, Shrimp and avocado, Alaska and spicy salmon.  She liked all of them. And for good reason, great rice, good portion of fish and we got to scarf them down at the house!

I really like this place, super consistent, good service, good value, and bitchin fish! This is my favorite sushi joint in the 216 not named Ginko! This is my go to place! 
XOXOXO  : )"}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the Eton location, Pacific East Coventry still holds its own with a better non-sushi menu, as well as an entire menu dedicated to Malaysian cuisine.

On the whole, it was pretty good. I was excited to try their Katsudon, which not many Japanese restaurants here do right or even offer at all. It wasn't on par with Asian Garden's--it was soggy, and the breading kept falling off the pork--but it was close enough to the real thing, AND HUGE, so it worked for me. For sushi, I had the escolar, mackerel, and tamago a la carte, all of which were very big and very good. I'm just glad they offer escolar, which is a smooth, almost buttery white fish I could eat for days. I urge everyone to try it (just in small portions, since it apparently leads to \"oily farts.\" No joke, even though it's pretty freaking hilarious). I also ordered the East Roll, which I wasn't so much a fan of. It was soggy, fell apart too easily, and some of the fish was not so fresh. 

We also tried some Malaysian. With the help of yelp reviews, we had the roti chennai and chow kueh teow. The roti chennai was not what I expected (thin, greasy, flakey), but OK I guess. We only got two pieces, which wasn't nearly enough for the curry it came with. The curry itself was good. My dinner partner said she loved it, but my tastebuds prefer Japanese style curry. The chow kueh teow was also pretty good. Had a strong sesame oil taste, but I love sesame oil.

Misc - Parking isn't easy anywhere on Coventry so I can't hold that against them. Prices are cheap. Our server was extremely friendly, sweet, and helpful... definitely an Asian auntie vibe. Overall, I like the place. I would go again, but more for their hot menu. If you want sushi, their Eton location still wins hands down."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been dining here for years.  Some of my favorites are the sweet potato tempura roll, Malaysian chicken puff pastries, and laksa, a coconut broth soup.  But the place has an extensive Malaysian and as well as a robust sushi menu. They serve complimentary green tea.  They sell bubble tea with tapioca pearls, honey dew is my go to flavor.  This place is perfect for a delicious meal in a casual setting.  Their portions are huge and their prices are very affordable.  The sweet potato roll is 4.50, laksa 10$ and puff pastries 3$.  I would happily dine here weekly.  I usually park in the metered garage a block away."}
{"text":"The principal reason for the 2 stars is the AWFUL service we received while dining there recently. We had a reservation for a party of 8 and one person's dish did not arrive until after the rest of us had received and eaten our food. All the while, our server generally ignored us unless we flagged her down to find out what was going on. She just made up excuses about how \"the seafood takes a long time to prepare\". Clearly, that is not true and it would have been much better had she just fessed up and explained that someone dropped the ball, apologized, and dropped that dish from our check. No such luck. When we asked her to remove the dish from the check, she responded with \"well, he ate it, didn't he?\" and would not let us speak with a manager. In the end, she gave us a gift certificate for the dish only saying she couldn't go back & remove the charge. Again, not true.

As someone who has worked as a server in several restaurants, we all know that anticipatory guidance goes a long way and it's the least you can do for a happy customer. This server TOTALLY missed the mark. For that reason, I'm not sure we'll return. Other servers appeared to be more helpful - were more apologetic about our issue, so maybe it was just this one person. BUt in general, i agree with recommendations to avoid large parties here. They clearly do not know how to handle them despite having a reservation. (There were other issues as well - not a smooth experience at all.)

The Japanese food was unimpressive - udon noodles were awful. But the malaysian food was delicious!!! If we go back, we'll stick to the malaysian side of the menu."}
{"text":"I've gone here quite a bit for lunch and I can say I've always walked away happy and satisfied. I suggest sitting at the sushi bar because it gives you the real experience.  The sushi is fresh and I love the lunch special of two rolls or three. I usually get three rolls and it comes with soup and salad  so i always walk away with leftovers. My favorite is the Alaska roll, eel, and avocado and tuna. You also can't go wrong with tempura!!! I recently tried the chirashi and it was delicious. The only thing I don't love about this place is that usually at sushi places if you sit at the bar the chef makes you a special treat. This happens rarely here. Also the service is ok but the food is good and fresh, both qualities I look for in my sushi. The location is great and the atmosphere is tranquil, try this out for lunch, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am not from the Cleveland area but could not pass by the opportunity to have Malaysian food. I am fairly knowledgeable with this cuisine since I have eaten it(or something similar) from birth. 

The staff at Pacific East were friendly. The restaurant looked really dark but seemed clean enough.

We ordered the roti canai, curry puffs and satay appetizers. The roti canai was fairly authentic - I balked at the price for the amount we got but it was the best dish of the night. The curry puffs were average. The satay was bland - do not bother with this at all. 

For our entrees, we tried the nasi lemak, mee siam and mee goreng. The nasi lemak was okay, I guess - instead of serving a spicy sambal, they served a thin and sweet tomato sauce. The chicken rendang served as part of the nasi lemak (not a traditional component) was disappointing.  The mee siam was hands down horrible. It was similar to a flavourless pad thai. The mee goreng was okay but tasted nothing like it was supposed to. Even though the entrees were largely untouched, the servers did not ask us if everything was okay. Granted, we should have spoken up but it was 9pm and we had just driven almost 5 hours. At the end of this meal, we were more ready than ever to just pass out.

I am giving them 3 stars (instead of 2) because I would order the roti canai and curry puffs again and it is simply possible that I ordered the wrong dishes. It is possible that if I didn't know what the dishes were supposed to taste like, I would have enjoyed them more. Also, their sushi might be their strong suit. So, I will give them another try on my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have tried both Japanese and Malaysian dishes here, and both are good.  The sushi is fresh, and their spicy tuna roll is one of the best that I have ever had.  I have also tried the Singapore Style Stir Fried Hokkin Seafood Noodle which was decent and the Malaysian Style Chili Beef which had good flavor and good quality beef pieces.  Staff is attentive even on a busy night."}
{"text":"The Giant Spider Roll was as wide as my fist and pretty much fit the dimensions of a footlong sub. 

If that didn't draw you in, the rest of our meal was also fantastic. They clearly do not pre-make anything--this food is fresh! The spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were flavorful and spicy without being overloaded or overpowered by spicy mayonnaise like many other restaurants do. The tempura within the spider roll and ocean roll was freshly fried and still hot when it reached our table. 

We mostly stuck to the sushi this time, but I can't wait to try their udon bowls and their Malaysian menu next time."}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time tonight. We were seated very quickly and the hostess was extremely friendly. It did take our server a good 10 minutes to come to our table to take our drink order. When he did arrive, he took our entire order at once. He was very rushed, seemed like there wasn't enough help for as busy as they were. 
We ordered the bridge for two. HUGE amount of food. So much, it could easily feed 3 people.
Let's face it, you can't take sushi home. Eww, so a lot of our meal went to waste. 
Everything was very tasty, though. 
We did want to order dessert and after sitting there waiting for about 15 minutes for our server to come back, a different server asked if we wanted something. We did and come to find out they were out of it. So, we just paid and left. I do wish our experience was a little better. The food was good, there was too much and a lot of it was wasted. Our services wasn't good at all. Will we return? Probably, but we won't order the bridge again unless there is at least 3 of us."}
{"text":"Far and away the best restaurant for sushi on the East Side! I have been eating at Pacific East since it opened, and I am always very pleased! They offer two different kinds of cuisines, Japanese and Malaysian, which they offer on two distinct menus. I have to admit, I had only ordered off of the Malaysian menu once in all my times of coming here, just because I love their sushi so much! All the rolls I've tried have been delicious. I especially like the dragon roll and the tempura rolls. However, I generally prefer more simple choices such as sashimi and nigiri, and Pacific East definitely does a great job with these! My current favorite dish is the hamachi don, which consists of pieces of hamachi sashimi over rice with a few different seasonings. Its really amazing and I always recommend it! The staff here is friendly, and you are never waiting too long for the food, even if its a packed weekend night!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I went in for lunch and we were seated immediately.  We ordered the spider roll and it was delicious.  There are about 6 rolls in one order, but the rolls were big.  The tempura was good, and the chicken teriyaki was okay.  Next time I think I would just get sushi.  I almost forgot, my favorite part of the meal was the thai ice bubble tea.  I've been looking for a good place in Cleveland that serves good bubble tea...and this is it!"}
{"text":"I really like the food there. I've been always going there regularly. But some of their waitresses are terrible. I don't think they know what they're doing and respect customer's time. I strongly recommend you open every stapled bag and covered boxes to check if they put everything in it. I ordered some food to go today. One waitress forgot to put a box of sushi in my bag. And they stapled the bag so I couldn't check in advance. I had to drove for another hour back there to pick up what they forgot. And no rewards offered, no apology given.  Also, there are supposed to be 2 spring rolls, but they only gave me one. And I asked specifically no wasabi for the sushi and sashimi but there still is wasabi next to my food. And all of these, are not the first time happened. BTW the waitress today is the one doesn't speak Chinese."}
{"text":"Since moving to the Cleveland east side we have been here several times when the sushi craving hits. So I guess that make me a fan! 

The pork shumai are good, our small child gobbles them up. The avocado salad is equally tasty, and again our small child does his best to eat all the avocado before we get any. Also, the house dressing is a very tasty ginger dressing (which I would love to pour over everything!). The miso soup is as expected. 

The nigiri sushi are a good size, and are always fresh tasting. Most are two bites for me, but the fish has always been tender enough for me to easily bite through. Most of the rolls we've gotten have been fine. They have a large selection of traditional and fun combinations for their rolls. The Alaska roll is a particular favorite of ours. 

The staff is always nice and accommodating - its not always easy to take a toddler out to dinner! Oh! I almost forgot to mention, I love that they give you the warm hand wipes before your meal. Plus points for that! If you don't order beer or sake, then it is very reasonably priced as well, for the three of us its usually about $30-$50."}
{"text":"If you favorite suchi is california roll - don't go to that place, go to Giant Eagle deli counter... or bring some antiemetics with you.
This restaurant completely blew me away, swept me off my feet with a delicious, authentic suchi I never heard of! 
If you are an adventerous raw-fish eater, you will be in heaven!  Sea Urchin and squid, seeweed salad, egg-custard...yum!
Service is always excellent, drinks are delicious...
Good restaurant to test your compatabilty with your date : it was a restaurant of a choice for our first (blind) date with my boyfriend...Once we were munching away together on Urchin, we both realized : raw fish eaters are rare to come by and should definetely stay together!
Upside: sushi as good as they get
Downside: hard to find and could use more advertisement"}
{"text":"Great sushi in Cleveland? You betcha! I eat lots of sushi in California and Pacific East rivals the best.  Huge pieces of fish,  super fresh, plentiful servings. 

The service and ambiance are terrific.  There's other Asian food on the menu too but that's for when you don't want sushi,  and when does that ever happen?

Full bar.

It's also on iDine. Cash back.  Hello!?!

What's not to love?"}
{"text":"So far the best sushi in Cleveland for the casual atmosphere and price. Don't go to Sushi Rock. If you want to pay more for quality sushi and great ambiance try Ginko and then Parallax next. PE: For the price, yes. For the service, yes, and the selection, yes. Very tasty and the added fish roe on every roll is great. PE does not prepare their Maki rolls with loads of rice, as I remember Sushi Rock does. In this respect, you get a more distinguished and balanced of seafood and rice."}
{"text":"This review focuses on Malay dishes.

When a restaurant serves cuisines from two different cultures that historically don't influence each other, I'm skeptical. e.g. Thai and Japanese. This is different from, say, Vietnamese and French, Vietnamese and Chinese, or Cambodian and Thai, which either colonization or large scale population migration occurred.

So Pacific East-Coventry gave that first impression. However, this is the only place to get Malay dishes in CLE, so if you were desperate for Hainanese Chicken ????, you would have give it a try. As we did 7 years ago.

Of course we made sure to investigate by grilling the owner a bit. She said they have two separate kitchens and chefs, one for each cuisine. 

I especially like the staff here. They have a special earnest, down-to-earth-ness. Uber low turn-over rate. 

--- here are Must Trys. You won't find these dishes anywhere else in CLE ---

Noodle Soup:
- Prawn Mee ???: My fave. Loads of flavors

- Laksa ???????: Loads of flavors. Taste different from Prawn Mee.

- Bak Kut Teh ???: rare to find. Technically there is no noodle in here, but it does have spare ribs in flavorful broth. 
---
Rice:
- Hainanese Chicken ????: The chicken fat in the coconut rice is the bomb. (Occasionally the kitchen messed it up when it wasn't mixed well. In that case, just tell them). When the dish is served, your initial impression might be..whoa...just plain, bone-in chicken? But it's seasoned well, my friend. 

- Nasi Goreng ????: Malaysian fried rice in garlicky, shalot-y chili sauce.

* I don't bother with their Rendang here. Initially I did, but overtime I lost interest. Too salty.
---
Fried noodles:

- Mee Goreng ????
- Chow Kueh Teow ?????
- Mee Siam ?????
- Singapore Style Stir Fried Hokkin Seafood Noodles ?????????
---
Vegetable:

- Sauteed water Spinach ?????? in shrimp paste. Makes a plain vegetable so tasty. Seasoned well. I like it.

- Rojak ????: plain veggie and fruit with spicy shrimp paste peanut sauce. This may be an acquired taste because it's pretty plain by itself. Good for those on a health kick though.

----------------
Last words:

- Herbal Spare Ribs Noodles ??????: They're out every time I remember to inquire it. So I have never tasted it!

- I asked my colleague from our Singapore location, who were visiting CLE for a business trip, tried this restaurant. He had Bak Kut Teh ???, commented the flavor is close, but he could still taste the package (as opposed to brewing the broth from scratch ingredients). This is in line with Yelper Daniel A.'s comment, that you can cook these at home buying packaged seasoning from Asian grocery. However my point is, for someone who doesn't grow up eating these dishes, can you tell the difference? Can you confidently duplicate the flavor profile at home? I know I couldn't. And I know I walked away satisfied from PE-coventry. That's why I keep coming back.

- Sometimes they tend to be heavy-handed: too salty, too much sauce, too sweet, etc. When ordering, make sure to ask to tone it down a notch (less Americanized)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat in! Located at the end of Coventry, this is in my opinion, the best restaurant there! Plus, it's the only place to get good Malaysian food!! 

The restaurant has two menus to choose dishes from, a Malaysian menu and a Japanese menu. 

Malaysian food= my favorites are: roti chanai (appetizer), prawn mee, chow kueh teow, laksa noodles, and the BEEF RENDANG. I've also tried the following which are also very good: Tom yum seafood clay pot, curry chicken noodles, and the hokkien mee. 

Japanese food=  appetizers: curry croquette (my fav!!), agedashi tofu, and Maguro tataki (very yummy!). sushi rolls: rainbow, green dragon, tempura, giant spider rolls, lobster tempura roll ...basically I love most of their rolls, especially the ones with eel. They have the classic rolls of course, like spicy tuna etc., but the ones listed are my favorites. The fish is pretty fresh, so I'm rarely disappointed.

Initially, some people had told me that they disliked the food at Pacific East, which made me a little nervous about trying the place out. After eating here however, I realized they were so sooo wrong! Perhaps, I should be wary about trusting those that don't eat a lot of Asian food... they obviously had no clue how good the food here is!"}
{"text":"These guys have a huge menu that I've never really had a chance to explored because the Sushi is just so good. I haven't had a bad dish here yet, and the saki selection is really nice as well. 

A perfect spot for a casual date night."}
{"text":"So after being away from San Diego for a few years, I've just come to accept that unless you live RIGHT by the ocean, they're not gonna be at optimal freshness. No place in Cleveland's gonna have the freshest I've ever tasted in my life, but Pacific East still does a pretty good job. I'm a fan of the Philadelphia roll, but I noticed pretty much anything that I've tasted from there is pretty damn good. I'm not a huge eater, so one or two rolls pretty much does me. I can sit down, get a Philadelphia roll and a soda there for under $10 and be full and happy as a clam. 

The waitstaff is also very nice. They have no problems with substituting ingredients and seem to be very knowledgeable about certain dietary restrictions. Once, I ordered a bowl of miso ramen and politely asked that they omit the pork from the soup (since I'm not a pork eater), and the waiter asked me if it was okay that there is a hard boiled egg in the soup. That tells me that if need be, a vegetarian meal is fully doable here.

I guess as a word of warning, they do not put forks on your table here, but I have no issue with this since I am fully capable of using chopsticks. I've never asked for a fork because I simply don't need one, so I don't know if they have them here or not.

But... In conclusion, this is definitely one of the best sushi places that I've been to outside of California."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in Cleveland, specially in terms of value. Sushi and sashimi always fresh. Sometimes a little bit crowded, with waiting times, but that's the price of being a god place. I go there on a regular basis and recommend."}
{"text":"My friend called me for an impromptu suggestion. I suggested Pacific East because I had togo sushi once from there and it was amazing. She invited me to eat with her and we went in right around 5pm. There are two sides of the restaurant, our side was a shade of pretty blue. 
They have two menus, both have a large selection. One menu is for mostly sushi, the other menu is their Malaysian cuisine. 
My friend got the 'bomb' roll which is the roll i had togo before. It is tempura lobster but wrapped in sliced cucumber vs. the traditional seaweed and rice. 
I ordered off of the Malaysian menu. I got the seafood and tofu casserole and the latte coffee bubble tea. My seafood casserole was great. I got large pieces of scallops (not bay scallops) shrimp without the tails, squid and tofu. The vegetables were fresh and ample. My only complaint is I was hoping for a more complex and flavorful sauce in the casserole pot. I ate so much and was so full and it looked like I barely touched my meal. 
The service was prompt. I will return as often as I am on the East side."}
{"text":"I have high standards when it comes to Asian food. Especially when it comes to south east asian food. So if you are wondering why I giving them 2 stars, it's because, like you, I know what burgers are suppose to taste like and if you would to end up at a Mickey Dees in India and ordered their \"hamburger\" you would say \"they call this burger?\"
To say that the food taste bad is not fair, it taste ok. Except, I think they can do so much better. The staff are from Malaysia so I know they can serve the real stuff. But somehow or rather, they've decided to \"Americanize\" southeast asian food. Come on! Stop it with the patronizing to the locals. Clevelanders are awesome at recognizing awesome food when it is. When you water down the coffee, you may serve more cups but you don't get the passionate followers who will in turn get more people to show up at your doorsteps!
That's my rant. Now on to the food. 
Sushi was ok. I've not had too much to excite me lately when it comes to Japanese food. Pacific East's sushi didn't either.  I really need to find a good sushi/ noodle house soon. Maybe I'll drive to nyc this week.
I posted a photo of their menu for their south east asian cuisine. I was brought up eating this stuff. I've had the good, the bad and the runs from when I was growing up there. So to be truly honest, my fellow americans, you may enjoy the Nasi Lemak or the Roti Channi. But just know they are so much better in it's unfettered state.
I do find it intriguing though that they do not refill your pop (soda, soft drinks). Something that is rather authentic to the asian dining experience."}
{"text":"The review is based mainly on wife's vegetarian feelings.  I would go with 3 stars for a first time impression, but for a vegetarian it is a four star dining opportunity.  Sushi was very good and professionally appointed.  Great tofu mango preparation and very good eggplant dish.  They seem to have their act together here and offering a wide variety of Asian cuisine based on Malaysian specialties.  Happy to have tried them, that they were open late, and to have a chance to come back again soon."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their sushi because it is too good to say no to! I always go back with the intention of trying something new but their sushi is outstanding!!!! 
The service is always good, friendly, and attentive. I wasn't a fan of the decor but it keeps it casual!"}
{"text":"Abstract: Hands down the best sushi place in Cleveland. 

I love this place. I make it a point to come here every time I visit cleveland. Their laksa soup is amazing. You can have a fatty moment and eat only that and you will be satisfied. It is loaded with shrimp, chicken, peppers onions, noodles and eggs. Soup heaven! A tip tho....share it with people or you wont be able to eat the food that you ordered (unless you were smart and actually didnt order any then dont worry about it) 
Now the sushi! Oh the sushi! Its amazing! Not an insane variety but who needs all of that. Whatever roll you will order is great!   
We had the red dragon, dream and ichiban roll. All three to die for...literally as there was so much food. 
Why can't have a back up stomach? Oh wait, its called to go boxes!"}
{"text":"Food are good, price is in a good range for the food it offers. I've ordered about 10 times from this place and they only messed up my order twice"}
{"text":"We lived in Japan and like Japanese food. For a restaurant with such a broad Asian menu, Pacific East does okay. If it was a dedicated Japanese restaurant our expectations would be higher and it would only score 2 or 3 stars. Being inexpensive and close to our home are pluses.
Sake was good and hot, miso soup was not. Tempura was too heavily battered and greasy for the real thing. Tempura dipping sauce was thin and watery. Sushi was fresh and well made; I cannot fault it, Mochi ice cream came topped with whipped cream and a cherry, gilt this lily did not need."}
{"text":"I go to Pacific East only to have their Malaysian food.  This restaurant seems to be the only one that I know of (please let me know if I am wrong) that serves Malaysian dishes in the area.

My favorite items on the menu there are Hainanese Chicken Rice (poached chicken served with chicken-flavored rice with minced ginger/garlic and soy sauce), Nasi Lemak (coconut flavored rice served with curry chicken, deep fried anchovies, picked vegetables, hard boiled egg and cucumber in small portions).  I've also tried their Bak Kut Teh but found that not so much too my taste.  If you enjoy a semi dry curry dish, I can suggest their Beef Rendang which is a very traditional Malaysian food.

The service at this restaurant can sometimes be inconsistent, especially if you go during peak hours.  Otherwise, the servers are attentive and the food comes out of the kitchen quickly.

I am going to try to visit the Pacific East location in Solon to try their food their soon."}
{"text":"We come to this location often.  They have a different menu than their location in Woodmere.  The Malaysian food and the sushi are very good.  They are usually quite busy.  If you are a fan of spicy food you can order your food extra spicy and they'll put birds eye chilies in it.  Whether or not it comes out very spicy or with a lot of the chilies, really just depends on which server you get."}
{"text":"I grow up in Asia and this is the only Japanese place I eat at. Good food. Good service."}
{"text":"I am madly in love with this restaurant. Amazing food.. My favs - roti Chanai, unagi sushi, Malaysian fried rice dishes .."}
{"text":"I've only tried their malaysian menu simply because that's harder to come by than sushi. It did not disappoint. We started out with Roti Chanai and it was so yum. The bread was a lil oily but crispy and went perfectly with the creaminess of the dip. Entrees were the laksa and the sauteed okras with chicken. Both were delicious but just slightly holding back some really bold flavors. I asked for hot sauce and they brought a plate of peanut hot sauce thing. I added them to the dish and it was SO good! I highly recommend asking for this sauce. Overall, I was so delightfully stuffed. I know the sushi is tempting but don't overlook their malaysian dishes!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place averages 4 stars kills me.

I'd rather eat cup ramen anyday over anything here. I nearly had a heart attack when I noticed they were opening another restaurant in Eton. One \"pacific east\" is already one too many.

To be fair, many people love this place. I don't know why; maybe I'm missing something. But you couldn't pay me to eat here again. Awful. Just awful."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved it! We are big fans of all sorts of Asian food and we could find a a lot of our favorite dishes here at a very affordable price.  The service was good and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One of those rare Midwestern sushi establishments that makes you feel like the Midwest is not that bad after all."}
{"text":"Pacific East has been on the Coventry strip for a long while, and its age shows in the dated decor. The small space is not cool or trendy, though it can be fairly intimate in the evening.

Sushi is spot on, and some of the best I've had in Cleveland. Not the cheapest, but not absurdly expensive either. Definitely one of the only choices for sushi on the East Side."}
{"text":"THE SKINNY:
Best for grabbing a late-night bite when you're in the mood for Japanese (sushi and otherwise) or Malaysian.  Quality of the food is prime when it isn't super-crowded and presumably the chefs aren't overwhelmed or rushed.

NOTABLY TASTY:
Curry seafood fried rice, XO sauce bay scallop fried rice, tonkatsu ramen, Ocean roll, tempura/deep-fried ice cream

THE GOOD:
Malaysian food is hard to come by, in Cleveland, Los Angeles, and everywhere in between, so props to having one in CLE!  The sushi is pretty good as well--a little loosely packed but decent.  Offers probably the closest Clevelanders will get to decent ramen, though it's still far from a somewhat standard Japanese rendition.  Carries a solid selection of the usual Japanese lagers.  Great for low-key meetups--ambiance is a cross between a late-night diner and 24-hour Korean tofu/BBQ house.

THE BAD:
 The way I haunt Pac East, you'd never think I'd be so consistently disappointed...but I am.  It's completely ridiculous.  As if I'd be more impressed if I went back more often.  Like trying your luck at the slot machines.  But with worse odds than most slot machines.  Complexity of flavors vary widely and seem to decrease when the house is packed.  Pac East is famed for its sushi in the Cleveland Asian immigrant community but honestly, I've had sushi/sashimi in Cleveland and Oberlin that surpasses Pac East in freshness, taste and texture.  As for the Malaysian food, aside from the novelty and rarity of it being Malaysian food, there's nothing stunning or spectacular to report.  Growing up visiting family and (more importantly) all the countless street food stands/hawker centers in Singapore, I know my standards will be higher than the average Asian cuisine lover when it comes to Malaysian/Singaporean food, but even if they weren't, there's a definite missing element--whether umami or imaginative pairing of textures--to most of their dishes.  

THE VERDICT:
If you haven't been, Pac East is worth a try.  You might land something delicious.  And the worst that can happen?  You might land something mediocre."}
{"text":"Given that I have had a lot of Japanese food - this place is very average for what you get. 

For those \"sushi' lovers - rolls are not really considered sushi. Rolls belong to the modified Japanese food group to suit American palates. Nothing wrong with that but please don't rate a Sushi place on its rolls. Go to Sushi Jiro and see if they serve spicy tuna rolls.

For those that say the fish is 'very fresh' - I'm not sure how fresh it can be in Cleveland but they taste like a 3 star sushi place in Los Angeles. The rice is a bit dry, and the fish is really too thick."}
{"text":"N THE FORM OF GREATNESS
I'm on a boat motherf**er take a look at me.  Yup, that's what my sushi would be singing but not for loooongg..... say good bye Green Dragon for you were the last to sink the ship.  If you don't get the point - I ate a freaking boat load of this sushi for it is far superior to any downtown Cleveland joint.

MIXED FEELINGS
The brown rice roll was a-okay but I should have expected this given I tried to play sushi god.  The menu aka bible was way too long.  I like options but gee whiz slim down that Cheesecake Factory looking 15 page plus menu. 

BAD TO THE BONE
What? No liquor!! Wait a second, only sake and a Discount Drug Mart wine list..eek.  Dear PacEast, step up your liquor game and while your revamping that menu consider revamping the 12th grade lunchroom decor.  Ambiance is nonexistent here.  You eat, you leave... better yet take it to go.  Yeah, I went there... the decor is THAT bad.

peace, blessing, salad dressing

The Kim"}
{"text":"The Japanese food that never disappoints. 

This is my favorite spot for sushi and noods. I have yet to try other spots with similar cuisine because I just love this place so much. 

Reasonably priced, for sushi and noodle dishes. When I go I always get both sushi and a noodle bowl to share with my significant other. They have all the rolls and noodle dishes to choose from, and can sometimes be overwhelming. I always try a different noodle dish every time I go. The udon noodles are fantastic, as well as the hot pots. Sushi rolls are pretty standard, but with the freshness the rice and meats/veggies seem to have every time, I wouldn't want  any other sushi roll. 

Parking can be a bit of a disaster depending on the time of day you want to visit. There's always street parking but you have to find it, and sometimes you park and have to walk a bit to get to the restaurant, but it's worth it, I promise. 

Sushi. Noodles. Soup. Spring Rolls. My favorite."}
{"text":"The only place I get sushi in Cleveland. Terrific value and great quality. I am not a fan of the interior and usually opt for take out."}
{"text":"Easily a top spot in Northeast Ohio for sushi lovers. As a guy who grew up in NY around some of the best sushi places in the country (see Katabuki, Long Island's top-rated restaurant), I can say that having this option is not something to take for granted. Pacific East is the destination for when you wish to savor the tastes and the presentation (as opposed to an experience like Sushi Rock, which seems more about being hip than being great).

The sushi rolls and sashimi selection available are not much different than other Japanese restaurants, but Pacific East then throws in wonderfully conceived and executed specialty rolls which will not be easily found in Northeast Ohio.

The atmosphere is decent, the waitstaff is average, and the flavors meet a heightened expectation. The differentiating factor at Pacific East is the quality of the construction of the sushi and the freshness and quality of the ingredients.

Bonus points for not letting the alternative dining fare offered (Malaysian) detract from the execution of the Japanese restaurant theme. The result is a restaurant offering something for everyone in your group letting the rest of us get our sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is under staffed to have a dine in experience on Friday. They are busy taking the take out order than serving customer who is eating there. If you want to have a take out business, then have staff for the take out only. I see they are soo busy with take out instead serving their customer. I have no complaint about their food."}
{"text":"We order out from here nearly every week.  This is the best restaurant on Coventry. The sushi is always fresh and pretty inexpensive.  The Malaysian food is pretty good too.  The hot food is decent but is not really that authentically Japanese.  I like the hot food at Shuhei better - but their sushi isn't as fresh.

On weekends the place gets pretty busy.  The service has always been very good and complies with our weird requests like no wasabe between the fish and the rice."}
{"text":"I have been to Pacific East on Coventry since almost 10 years ago.  Wouldn't call myself a frequent diner there since I live on the west side.  However, for the same reason, I can especially pick up things during my every visits.

The experience tonight was one of the worst unfortunately.  It wasn't super busy (we went there around 5:30 pm).  10 minutes after we sat down until I had to fly down a girl to get our menu.  Everything we got (except sushi) was lukewarm, including miso soup, (not so) hot tea, tempora shrimps, and the broth in ramen.  They were all supposed to be steaming hot.  Surprisingly, My sushi came before the appetizer.  I could have forgotten about this if the sushi were good, but it wasn't something I would write home about.  After we finished eating, I went to the men's room.  Sadly, the light was broken so I had to use my iPhone to get some light in the darkness.  I told one guy who works there, and he was just about to fix it so I'm pretty sure I was just the unlucky one.  It must be the weather (-2 F) tonight - nothing went well really."}
{"text":"I've been to Pacific East on numerous occasions, but I really enjoy getting take out from here. Their Japanese rice bowls [donburi] are massive and delicious - my personal favorite is the pork curry bowl. 

My family loves the sushi here. When they come to visit from Chicago, we almost always stop by for all their specialty rolls and finish it off with some tempura ice cream. That dessert is massive - it could easily feed three or four people. 

Service can be slow, especially if you come during a peak time. They may not come up to you right away to take your order, so it's best to try and get your waiter/waitress's attention when you're ready. 

This place is tasty and has a nice vibe; the decorations are sea-themed and they have a large selection of Asian beers, which is always a plus. Pac East is one of my favorite restaurants in Coventry, and I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place!! I have never had a bad experience here, nor tried anything I didn't like. I would say I am addicted :)"}
{"text":"It's crazy how often I have a craving for this place, in the short 3 weeks that I have been in the Cleve, I have been here 3 times.  I was having some major sushi cravings when I 1st moved here and I was given a recommendation to go here with the title \"Pacific East is the best sushi in all of Cleveland\" from a local bartender.

I was disappointed.  Their sushi is fresh and tasty and I was pleasantly surprised by the additional Malaysian menu (I used to live in New Zealand and worked at a Malaysian restaurant so I am a big fan).  I ordered the tofu satay (only $2.95 btw) with the crazy good peanut sauce.  I also go the roti chanai with the potato curry instead of the chicken curry (I love love love malaysian roti).  Finally, I am obviously some kind of pig, the 2 roll sushi combo with miso and salad.  Their miso I think is killer.  I either think miso is disgusting or amazing and there it is amazing (although my dude isn't as blown away as me).  

My only complaint is that the sushi pieces themselves are too large.  I like a small sushi roll, something I can fit in my mouth in one bite.  I mean who likes to eat a sushi piece in 2 or more bites it just doesn't work.  Shit starts falling out of it, the 2nd bite is like only nori and rice and a shred of cucumber. It just doesn't work.   So Pacific East, make your sushi smaller and you'd be the best."}
{"text":"Just in case anyone is confused, this place actually has two chefs and two menus. It can get pretty busy, but I have never waited long for a table. I generally order off the Malaysian menu here, as I have found the Japanese food here pretty underwhelming. 

A lot of people rave about the sushi here, but it doesn't seem to be anything special to me. I've also ordered the ramen here once, which was a mistake, since I found pieces of undissolved paste in the soup. 

Try the roti chenai here, as it is fluffy and crispy the way it is supposed to, although the curry could be spicier. It is probably one of their best dishes. The Hainanese chicken rice, as well as various stir fried noodles, is all quite good here as well. I would not order the items that are likely to be less frequently ordered, as it is likely to have been sitting in the fridge/freezer for ages. I once ordered the sambal stingray, and it was definitely not fresh and didn't taste right either.

I spent my childhood years in Singapore (15 years, to be exact), and while the food here is not 100% authentic, it generally tastes the way it is supposed to and definitely satisfies my occasional cravings."}
{"text":"Pretty bad.  We stopped in for dinner Tuesday night and ordered a bowl of edamame to start with.  After a third of the way through the bowl we noticed a small brown object on one of the edamame pods.  When I brushed it off onto the table I took a closer look and was horrified to see that it was a cockroach.

My friend approached the woman who seated us and relayed what had happened to which she responded \"someone will be with you in a moment.\"  After a while, our waitress finally came over with the remainder of our dinner, apologized and offered to take the edamame off of our bill at which point we got up and proceeded to leave.   

As we left, my friend, who frequents the restaurant often, approached the woman who seated us, for the second time, and told her to relay this to the owners, which she said she would. There was absolutely no initiative on her part to rectify the situation and so I can only guess that this wasn't considered as serious a matter as we thought it to be. 

Once we arrived home I wrote a note to the owners of Pacific East about our experience at the email address listed on their website.  I just heard back from them FIVE days later, with a tepid apology, which focused less on the cockroach experience and more on my having mentioned that the shrimp tempura came out cold.  Wow!  If I could give them a \"zero\" here, I would."}
{"text":"Everyone suggests this Pacific East for sushi and I am not sure  why... I truly believe the Eton location blows it out of the water. Why waste your money here if you want Japanese food with good quality, size, taste, and price.

I guess the major draw to this location is the Malaysian food? Even so, I am not impressed. The dishes I tried tasted like Americanized Chinese food. Which I can easily get for five bucks at the shitty Panda Express in the mall. The ONE thing I would say I find mind boggling about this place is the smoothies (not bubble tea). So flavorful and thick. Mine barely melted after an hour... HOW!?!?"}
{"text":"For cleveland, this place has the best sushi we have tried. The food is fresh and the tables are clean. The service is generally good, although sometimes we do get the language barrier. Most nights there is a wait but it is never more then 15 minutes. And prices are very reasonable. They have a sister location in Eton Plaza, but the prices are jacked up for some reason for a much smaller space."}
{"text":"I gave pacific east five stars for their sushi. I go here all the time and find the sushi to be consistently great quality and well worth the price. If you go at lunch time, there are really great deals for sushi roll combos! If you are looking to splurge on a larger meal, their sushi bridge for two is amazing but has so much sushi it's hard to finish. I mostly get the sushi at pacific east but have occasionally tried some of their other dishes, which I think are just okay. I definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for a great sushi meal but their other food is nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick service and conveniently located near a parking garage. They actually have a full Japanese and a Malaysian menus. I will certainly go back in my next visit to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials, plus they have takoyaki!  I had the oyako don, which they give you huge amounts of, but is sadly lacking in some flavor.  Additionally, as I ate more of the rice bowl, I crunched on a few bits of eggshell that they didn't get out of the dish.  Yuck.  The takoyaki itself though was alright and had a good crispy outside.

Edit 4-22-08:  Came here to eat for dinner, and I got some sushi rolls and some deep fried ice cream.  The rolls were reasonably priced ($4.50 for spicy yellowtail roll and other similar rolls) and fresh.  They put a good amount of fish and don't skimp on the avocado if you get a roll with avocado in it.  The deep fried ice cream was really good.  They have a choice of green tea, mango, and vanilla.  I'm bumping up my review a star because their dinners are really tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to pe many many times and it neve fails when you get take out you will pay then you wait at least an extra 10-15 mins because there backed up but if you are dinning in it will be the best  Japanese  restaurant you will ever go to"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants on the east side of Cleveland.  It's the restaurant I go to most often for sushi.

Sushi isn't the only thing that's good here, though.  When coming to dinner, you'll get either a Japanese menu or a Malaysian menu.  It's always difficult to decide which menu to order from.  Then it's even more difficult to decide what entree to order.  I've recently become a huge fan of their clay pots, which have enough food for 2 meals and are filled with meat, vegetables, and a delicious gravy.  The noodle dishes are also excellent here.  The beef stir fried noodles are done very well here - better than many Chinese restaurants which serve the dish.  Curry chicken noodles are also great here.  The only dish I've found mediocre here so far is the teriyaki.  Last time, I thought the sauce was a little on the sweet side.

And service is here awesome.  One time for my birthday, I made a dinner reservation for 20+ people 3 hours before.  Absolutely no questions asked and my party was given the side room.  Granted this was on a Monday, but I was happy that my guests were not limited to a fixed price menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi in Cleveland. It has a nice casual feel with an adorable quirkiness (the walls are aqua blue with painted fish and framed pictures/descriptions of fish). Get their bubble tea! It does not disappoint. Ask them to make you a chocolate/coconut mix (drool). But sushi is the real star here. The lunchtime maki combo is my go-to. I love the Alaska, Boston, and spicy salmon rolls, but you will find your own favorites! Large pieces of delicious fish, perfect rice every time, just an incredible tummy pleaser. Go!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the second time this weekend and it sealed its place in our minds as the best sushi in Cleveland. The fish is so, so fresh, the sashimi just melted in our mouth. The staff was friendly and accommodating and it was way less expensive as many of the places closer to downtown. So good!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Japanese restaurant in Cleveland... possibly anywhere!  The selection of sushi is vast and reasonably priced considering the quality.

Not only do they have Japanese cuisine, but Malay, too.  This is one of the highlights, as it turns an already vast menu into a truly limitless one.  There's something for everyone here: surf/turf, meaty/vegetarian, heavy/light.  Everything.  

They also have a great selection of bubble teas, as well as tempura and curry.  In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a place with so many kinds of tempura, everything from okra to taro, sweet potato to Pacific jumbo oyster, and more!  

The location is great, too.  Located right on the Coventry strip, you can stop at a number of stores after you're done eating.

The service is good and the wait staff is always in a good mood.  The decor is very... blue.. which fits the whole 'Pacific' thing, I'd say.  Not too dressy, but nice enough to take visiting friends or family.

One more thing... COCONUT RICE."}
{"text":"I like the variety of foods they have and the price is also reasonable. The key selling point for me is that whatever I have ordered so far has tasted really good. 

I would suggest trying the sushi, udon noodles and Mochi ice cream. (I guess I love Japanese food!)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Malaysian and Sushi menu for our party of 4. The chicken satay appetizer was delicately flavored and wolfed down! Followed by the Malay Beef curry variations, seafood soup  and a chicken \"crazy\" noodle type entree. Sushi rolls were fresh! Portions ginormous!

The restaurant has this odd layout with various rooms branching off the main eating area. We made reservations and were put in the back \"party\" room.
Which is quiet but has no windows... 

Recommend asking for seating in any of the front street side eating areas. Service could be better as the user dishes were not removed fast enough to open up space on the table and the entree delivery was staggered or delayed so everyone had to wait. Only 2 stars for service."}
{"text":"great selection and quality!! only place I can find hamachi kama in the cleveland area. wait staff is super friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"Pacific East is a solid choice for some Japanese food in Cleveland! I've been here several times now, and I've had good experiences every time I've been here. I've tried their yakisoba, their lunch maki combo, and their oyako-don. I thought the yakisoba was pretty tasty, but probably not my favorite dish here. Their lunch maki combo is a great value, and this is what I would go for if you are feeling sushi! The sushi itself was quite tasty, and the fish tastes pretty fresh. Finally, the portion of the oyako-don is HUGE and can definitely feed you for a couple meals. 

Pacific East also has some Malaysian dishes but I can't speak to these as I haven't tried any of them. Service here is always great - the servers are prompt at refilling your tea/water and are always willing to split the check for you even when you come in large groups. There is both street parking and garage parking nearby, and you can get 30 free mins of parking with the meters in the garage (each additional 30 mins is $0.25, I believe). Overall, a great spot near campus for some very affordable Japanese food!"}
{"text":"The waits are so long. Sometime their food taste good, and sometimes doesn't. Some of their sushis are better than others. My favorite is the mochi ice-cream."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place - it looked promising on the outside, but once I walked in it sort of felt like any other Japanese restaurant you could find in a strip mall. The sushi was okay, but did not feel very authentic. Also had the sukiyaki which again was okay, but nothing amazing. The waiters/waitresses put in a good effort, but fail to truly deliver. It took me a while to request a spoon so we can share the sukiyaki, and they looked at me like no one has ever requested for a spoon before. The language barrier probably didn't help......"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for sushi!  I have been coming here for years.

I absolutely love their Ocean Roll, Spider Roll and Unagi.  Their tempura is also fantastic!  I have never had anyone tell me about a negative food experience here.  I find Sushi Rock up the road the be too salty and overpriced.  Come to Pacific East if you want great & humble food at a fair price!

The last time I went I got the Ginger Duck Noodle soup.  I was shocked at how yummy it was.  I'm not usually an egg noodle soup fan, but this dish was delicious!  If you love ginger and a hearty broth, order this dish!  It's great!

The bubble tea is pretty good.  In my opinion, they overcook the bubbles.  It's way too squishy!  I tend to like my bubbles with a little more bounce in them.  I've tried traditional Taiwanese Milk Tea and Thai tea flavor.  Both were tasty and refreshing!

They can be really busy in the evenings for dinner, so sometimes the waitresses are a bit rushed and overwhelmed.  Be patient and understanding because they all are genuinely wonderful and nice people!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi, it's fresh and has great flavor. I used to hear mixed reviews but I ignored them. Great small sushi place!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Great Malaysian food at Coventry. They are always busy so there's quick turnover of food. Try the seafood hot pot and Singapore noodles. We have been here at least 30 times and have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Cleveland and wow, I want to live in this neighborhood.  Really cool shops, bars and vibe.  Found PacEast on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

Cool little place with a bit of an eclectic decor.  The sign says they are closing for a week to renovate.  Probably a good move.  After checking out the menu, I went with started with some shumai.  While I was munching and diping the delightful morsels, the music hit me.  Wait, the MUZAK hit me.  OMG, they're playing instrumental piano hits of the 70's.  Seriuosly folks, let's change the background music.

On to the sushi.  Copious amounts of uni, some toro and hamachi sashimi.  Added a tuna/salmon roll to the party.

In summary, great food, good service and sounds like they're doing a killer take out business.  Bravo!  But really, can you change the tunes when you reopen?  Rod Stewart on acoustic piano is replacing water boarding at Gitmo."}
{"text":"If you love Japanese food this is mos-def the place to go. Not only can you enjoy some of the best Sushi I've every eaten but the culture of the wonderful street Coventry.But if your not willing to spend $20-30 dollars then don't sweat it. It's the perfect place to take a date because on a night when it's not to buzy it really cozy. My friends have Wooed a couple of girls by bringing them here. The smoothie are Awesome!! If you want you can bring a huge group to share Sushi that is in a huge wooden boat. 

~*~ Unagi Warning ~*~
Guys please be careful not to order dishes with Unagi=eel might make you a little HOT or depending on how the night is going you might want to try some Ichiban which is my fav Maki Roll. Don't worry ladies the Unagi has no effect on you. Lol. Could just be a myth but my friend told me he got kinda hot. 

~*~Sushi Lesson For those who have never eaten Sushi~*~
If you don't know what to get you can never go wrong with California Rolls.But here is a list of good Maki Rolls to try and what they have in them.Note this list contains some of my favs. ^.^

*California Roll
Cucumber,Smoke Salmon, Avocado,

*Ichiban
Eel,Smoke Salmon, Cucumber, Avocado, Yummy Tempura Sauce

*Shrimp Tempura
Breaded Shrimp, Cucumber, Avocado, Yummy Tempura Sauce

*Salmon Roll kinda simple Smoke Salmon lol.

If your not into Sushi you must try one of their delicious Teriyaki Dishes or a Noodle bowl.But I'll tell you now Pacific East is not for the faint of heart who is afraid and shake in their boots at the idea of eating raw or semi-cooked seafood.

Mata ne Readers!!"}
{"text":"Tried out Pacific East on a Thursday around 5:30pm and stayed until around 8.  I was surprised to see a pretty steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant, and similar to the area, lots of hipster younger types.

Pros: massive menu.  There was a Japanese menu and Malaysian menu.  Impressed that the kitchen can do so much!  I am vegetarian and there were a number of solid options.  Wait staff was very nice, we interacted with a few different people and they were all very sweet.  Very competitive and reasonable prices.  

Cons: got tempura (which was delicious and amazing) and some sushi.  The sushi was really just OK.  Rice on sushi wasn't all that sticky and sushi fell apart a bit.  Wait staff disappeared for a while, we were done eating and waiting a bit for the check.  Disclaimer that we were all from LA, so difficult for a Cle eatery to beat the fishy freshness you can get in Cali."}
{"text":"Had 3 of their sushi rolls - very good and the roll size was larger than any other sushi place I've been to."}
{"text":"True talent pours out of this kitchen.  They make delicious sushi AND soups AND stone pots - a rare combined feat.   I highly recommend the big soups, which feature rich and flavorful homemade broths.  Order a couple of them and share.  I love the extensive menu options.  I've ordered more than a dozen different dishes and never been disappointed.  We recently placed a big take-out order for a birthday dinner and were very satisfied.  For one, the to-go menu also offers many different options.  For another, they don't short you on the portions due to the limitations of travel containers.  And lastly, they didn't mess up our order!  They included every last item and were not rude (like some Chinese restaurants) when I stopped to double-check on a few.  Here are a couple of the winning dishes:

Laksa 
Lamb & Herbal Noodles Soup 
Miso Soup 
Hiyashi Wakame 
Beef Negimaki 
X'Mas Roll (tuna)
Alaska roll (salmon)
Futomaki (veg)
Eel & Mushroom Roll 
Beef Udon (meh)"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST sushi I have ever tasted; the ambiance is nice and the staff is always friendly.
Since I generally avoid Coventry anymore, I order my food to-go- it's always fresh and the order is always correct.  
I have been a fan of this place since its opening, and I have seldom been disappointed!
Malaysian cuisine is superb!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have been to. Service is wonderful and timely. The food is always delicious and the presentation is great. My fiance' and I came here on our first date and have made it a tradition."}
{"text":"No matter the sushi or Malaysian food, I give this restaurant 4 stars. It's always busy and food is fresh and delicious. I at least visit pacific east once a month to satisfy my Asian tongue."}
{"text":"Pacific East is luckily right around the corner from me and I'm no stranger to their dine in and take out services. My husband and I enjoy their fresh sashimi options and extensive sushi menu. Unlike the Pacific East in Chagrin Eaton the restaurant in Cleveland Heights has an additional menu filled with Asian food options should you be that person who doesn't eat fish. I think the decor is pretty generic of most Asian restaurants and certainly not upscale or romantic but the food and service are great."}
{"text":"The food was good not the best sushi but pretty good and the presentation was definitely on point. The wait staff wasn't the best and took a bit to come for us to order and get refills etc. Overall I would definitely try the place if you're near it and the food portions were worth the price as well"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. 
This is totally the best sushi in Cleveland as well as the most reasonably priced. Fish is always fresh. Spicy tuna is the best (non specialty) roll by far. 
I didn't explore the Malaysian menu until almost a year of coming here but that was a mistake! The soups are delicious... Laksa and prawn mee being my favorite. Only ten bucks and I always have left over for lunch the next day. 
There's so many options on the menu you really can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from this little place in the middle of Cleveland...but the sushi was fantastic.  Note that this review is only for the sushi, I can't speak for the rest of the menu. This is now my pick for sushi in Cleveland.  We ordered the American Dream roll, the California roll, the avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll.  Other people at our table also ordered other rolls and were equally impressed.  The sushi was extremely fresh and flavorful. The tempura was light, crispy and delicious.  I will be going back soon, and I recommend that you do as well."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! This has quickly become my go-to place to eat! It's definitely the best sushi in Cleveland, and at reasonable prices. The wait staff is always friendly too. Try the rainbow roll - it's fantastic! Don't waste your time with Sushi Rock, when you have Pacific East as an option. Sushi Rock is overpriced and their sushi is sub-par compared to this place."}
{"text":"Pacific East has the best sushi in cleveland, hands down. 

I've previously only done takeout but after a day of monster trucks and robocop, a few friends and I decided to eat in. They ordered a stew that ended up being way too big so I tried a bowl-so good! Filled with veggies and pork with plenty of gristle-y goodness, it's definitely more traditional and I loved it! 

I ended up ordering spicy tuna and unagi rolls, and octopus sashimi. All were delicious and super fresh. They even offer live sushi which isn't something you'll find anywhere else around here. I'm not sure I'm adventurous enough to try it though. 

The only downside is it's a tiny, but extremely busy place so it's always super packed and service can be slow. But it's worth it for a few drinks and dinner with friends :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in town as far as I'm concerned.  It is a quaint little place on the north corner of Coventry.  There is inexpensive, relatively safe parking in the Coventry parking garage just down the street.

I have been there countless times over the years and their sushi and sashimi are always fresh.  I particularly love their lunch time sushi/sashimi combo that is served with miso soup, salad with japanese dressing, and green tea.  Also excellent are their large rolls (ie. Giant Spider roll, yum!!!) which are great for ordering for the group.  If sushi/sashimi is not really your thing, they also have a great tempura, a bento box with a variety of goods (good sampler dish), various Japanese noodle soups and noodle dishes.  All are really, really good!  

The last several years they have added some other SE Asian cuisine--I just have not tried them so cannot comment on them.

I will have to say that I have never had a disappointing meal at Pacific East and it will stand as one of my favorite places to eat.

Edit:  very seldomly, some slices of sashimi are not all that they could be.  Fresh, yes.  But not choice cuts.  This is probably a 1 in 10 type of occurance though."}
{"text":"This has become my most frequented restaurant. Food is always good and consistent. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, decent service. Very nice facility. Quiet & modern. Great for quick late dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and excellent service.  Most definitely visit this establishment again.  Even though I do not like sushi, they do have other options available which are delicious and delightful."}
{"text":"You know, I love this restaurant. I love it so, so much. I go here all the time, and personally think it's the best sushi for the price in Cleveland. I love the Westfield Roll, the Bomb Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll, the tempura, the gyoza, the miso soup, and even the edamame (I saw someone else said they thought their edamame was old- I've never had that issue). 

I will never stop going here, no matter how terrible the service may be. Honestly it's hit or miss. There are a few servers who know and recognize me at this point (I go there all the time, remember?), but others who I also see all the time who are awful. They forget drinks, mistime orders, never refill tea or water... just bad habits all around.

I encourage you to go despite the spotty service, because I think the food is worth it. Just give yourself some extra time if you need to be somewhere, and some extra change in the meter."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect to find good Sushi in Cleveland but this place has some of the best Sushi I have had.  I ordered the Sashimi lunch which consisted of various slices of raw fish along with lots of goodies on the side including a seaweed salad.  The fish was extremely fresh.  The presentation was also very classy and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Mondays and thursdays are the best time to visit this establishment because the seafood is fresh/recently delivered. Something like that. Also, this place has the absolute best chicken tempura I have had in Cleveland. I would go here every day for that alone. My husband quite likes the sushi here, especially on Mondays and Thursdays."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Having lived in Japan for over 4 years, and having eaten my share of sushi while I was there, I can honestly say this is very good quality.  I had some of the tough stuff: Uni, Ikura, Toro, Unagi. All great.  Even better, they had tako wasabi (octopus with wasabi). And if it helps... this place had more Japanese people in it than I thought lived in all of greater Cleveland, a sure sign of its quality.  Best sushi yet!"}
{"text":"While not an expert on sushi, I have had my share from Cleveland to Vegas to several Carribean areas.  IMHO, Pacific East is at the top of the list. 

We went on a Saturday night right in the middle of the dinner rush, line  out the door but were seated pretty quickly and served even faster.   We had the most helpful Japanese waitress ever.  She helped us wade through the huge menu and made suggestions that turned out to be spot on!  A real sweetheart that we will ask for again next time.

Their ginger salad dressing and miso soup was very tasty.  I know others have complained about portion size and how big the rolls are but we were really hungry and didn't have any problem making them fit our mouths. (they are big but that's ok!)

Both of us noticed how fresh and tasty the rice was and the seaweed wraps not tough like we've found at other establishments.

We live just a few short blocks from SumoBoy in Mentor and while Pacific East is over a 30 minute drive, it's going to be our new favorite sushi spot.

We noticed as many people getting take out as eating in.  With the parking issue in the Coventry area, I see why.

Cleveland may not be world famous for it's raw fish but Pacific East does a darn good job."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and delicuous,ramen was okay and oyakadon was soooo dry.Overall pretty good place for Japanese food.Im from California and this is one of my top picks for Japanese food in Cleveland"}
{"text":"When a dining establishment advertises many different types of cuisine, for example, Japanese, Malaysian, and sushi, one sometimes approaches it suspiciously. How can a restaurant excel in so many different areas? Somehow, Pacific East has cracked that code, and is serving up delicious, quality food in all these styles.

-miso soup:  just the right combination of salty and umami, with tofu and seaweed for texture
-squash sushi:  uniquely flavored, perfect with a little soy sauce and wasabi
-nasu-dengaku:  my favorite of the evening, tender broiled eggplant generously glazed with sweet miso sauce

My dining companions ordered vegetarian ramen soup and a Malaysian lamb dish, and both enjoyed them with lip-smacking delight.

As an added bonus, the staff is pleasant and efficient, and the pricing is very reasonable. All in all, next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll try to pay Pacific East another visit."}
{"text":"I just moved in around the corner and I'm feeling pretty lucky right now. $15 for an order of gyoza and tonkatsu ramen. I got takeout so the gyoza were crispy anymore but the flavor was fantastic. The ramen was a little one dimensional. I think it needed some grated fresh garlic or sliced scallions on top. I was also hoping for a little more pork, but it was still pretty awesome. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was terrible , and the place was kinda dirty. I wish they had a better staff for such great food."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a weekday night. I got the hot and spicy beef noodle soup which was huge and very yummy and flavorful, a nice medium spice level. My one friend got the beef short rib sizzling plate, the beef was kind of tough and hard to chew. We also got the Malaysian pancakes with curry which was very tasty, the pancakes were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, oily in a good way. Large portions, we all took leftovers. The Thai bubble tea is also yummy, but not a lot of boba."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and was very satisfied with each visit! I ordered mostly off of the Malaysian menu and had the spare ribs which were very flavorful and came out on a hot steaming skillet with a nice mix of vegetables. Visually all of the dishes looked very well put-together. There are a few Japanese beers to select from and a good array of sake choices as well. 

The service was very attentive during each visit and they had no problem with us staying around after the meal for a bit to talk. This place is nearly always full but I haven't really seen much of a wait since there are tons of tables spread throughout a few different rooms. Prices are reasonable around $10 to $15 for a good sized main dish.

I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always dependable. With a menu this large, it's impossible to not find something to enjoy. Easy place to go when you can't decide what you want to eat. There are both Japanese and Malaysian menus. I've had the ramen and sushi from the Japanese menu. My friends have had the various Malaysian dishes, so I can't speak for them. Nothing really sticks out as \"oh my this is amazing!\" But everything is good.  My favorite thing at this restaurant is their ginger salad dressing that comes with their house salad. It's amazing. My friends and I, quite literally, end up licking our plates! Also, you can purchase a container of it for home, which I've also done! It actually makes me enjoy salads, which is something I'm even impressed by (fyi, I hate salads)."}
{"text":"We heard good things things about this place from friends. We went in a group of 12 people and our server was extremely rude and very slow service  (took us one hour just to get appetizers!). The meat in our entree dishes were cold and not cooked properly. Extremely disappointed. All of our stomachs felt uneasy after dinner."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi BAD so I rushed to this place and they told me upon entering that I had 5 min to order because they closed in 20 min. That was fine - I just ordered a miso soup and a sashimi appetizer. Prices for sushi a la carte was outrageous - $3.50 and you only get 1 piece?? They had specials that looked interesting, but I had no time to consider that, of course. The sushi chefs were already giving me dirty looks for coming in so late. :/ 

Sashimi tasted more like nigiri without the rice. It was thick and contained some stringy fattyness, not even the usual for nigiri let alone sashimi. It was hard to bite into. Salmon was the best - soft and pretty fresh. Tuna was tough as tomatoes! Miso was the lazy kind without any tofu pieces in it. Eh. I wouldn't go back except maybe to sample their Malyasian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Cleveland from San Diego and were looking for a good sushi place. We weren't convinced we'd find one, but heard good things about Pacific East and tried our luck.

So far we've been here twice. It's a fairly large restaurant that can get pretty busy at dinner on the weekends. Their rolls were delicious and fresh; we liked both the toro and the tuna rolls. The second time we came for lunch, and I had the Bento box. I was pleased with the food and their service. I'm sure we'll be back again fairly often."}
{"text":"Don't let the crowded Saturday nights fool you-- 

Spicy Tuna Rolls: Tuna was mushy/, rolls were hastily made/squished, presentation BAD! 

Basil Chicken: Don't call it Basil Chicken if I can only find one sprig of Basil in the whole dish

Thai Milk Tea: The use of powdered creamer?? Really? I'm insulted. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in Cleveland, but, as it has become more popular, it has also become more crowded. Sushi is still very good quality. And the environment is much more low-key than Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Okay, this review is solely on Malaysian food.

Went here tonight, with some of my fellow umich alumni friends.  In the cute little shops of Coventry, Pacific East lies on the corner of all these shops.

We entered the small restaurant (maybe 7-8 tables?) with blue walls, and was immediately seated. We decided to go with family style (after my friends gave me the \"uhh...sushi is OKAY\" which equals, in my head, \"whaa? Just OKAY? um NO\"), and we ordered the chili eggplant dish, the seafood egg noodle dish, and the coconut rice (with the anchovies and some type of pork).

The eggplant...wasn't really spicy, but it was cooked pretty well. The seafood egg noodle dish with its almost gravy type sauce, was good as well... kinda wish it had more of a bite. The coconut rice...omg, this was soooo good. With anchovies, red peppers, curry pork? and rice, was so so so good. Mmmmm.

In addition, the waitresses were super helpful. We asked them a lot of questions about the dishes, and they were able to give good recommendations with super detailed descriptions. Good job waitresses, on REALLY knowing the food (I do hate it when waitresses have no idea on their food).

I think I might just come back someday just to try the sushi (although, I do hate being disappointed by sushi). But for Malaysian food...mmm. yum yum. I'm so glad I have leftovers. haha."}
{"text":"YAY my go to japanese restaurant in cleveland heights!

First of all, if you are a sushi/sashimi fan and if you have many foodie friends like I do, GO TRY THEIR SUSHI COMBO! My boyfriend and I always order their sushi bridge, which is GIANT! It was SO MUCH food that both of us almost died. In fact, when the waitress came check up on us, she was so surprised that we finished the whole bridge that she kept saying \"good job\" to us. Yes good sense of humor!

I also really liked their takoyaki. It's very legit. I had takoyaki in japan, in shanghai, and in the west coast, this place has the closest taste to what I had in asia.

A little pricey and usually busy during the weekends, so make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"Definitely the freshest sushi in all of Cleveland! I am comparing this ariyoshi (cleveland heights), shuhei (chagrin), sushi rock (beachwood and downtown), and sumo (rocky river).  It honestly is comparable to fantastic sushi is new york.  

Some of my favorites are the white tuna sashimi, ocean roll, and ichiban rolls.  Great selection of malaysian dishes as well.  Sake selection also includes unfiltered sake, which is rare in most places around here.  

Great for a big group, friends, family, or date.  Coventry area is fun to go around in.

LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Quick and attentive service. Great prices. Casual family atmosphere. Had two menus, a Malaysian and extensive sushi menu. Loved the beef satay and the volcano roll especially. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place during evening and decided to give this place a try. It was totally above my expectations!

The sushi and sashimi were amazing. The seafood were fresh. I couldn't stop being amazed by every customers' orders that night. All of the dishes looked amazingly beautiful.

Also had the coconut shrimp. The shrimp were huge and seasoned very well. I feel like I can finish the whole plate by myself with a bowl of white rice. (And that was a huge plate)

What I liked the best was there Malaysian chicken with rice. The rice was flavorful. There were lots of spices that I cannot recognize but it tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Since moving back to Ohio from San Diego, I have ha trouble finding good sushi. Pacific East is about the best I've had. I've loved and devoured every roll I've had. The staff is on point and friendly. The decor is kind of odd, but who cares if the food is good."}
{"text":"When I lived far away from Cleveland, Pacific East was always on my list of places I had to go while I was home. I can't vouch for authenticity (although signs point to pretty darn authentic), but I can vouch for deliciousness and value, and both of them are top notch. I usually come for lunch, where $10 gets you two maki rolls, miso soup, and side salad with amazing dressing. If you're not in the mood for fish, the katsu don and salt and pepper eggplant (from the Malaysian menu) are some land-locked favorites. In short, eat here--you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My boy toy and I came here on a Thursday night. It was a lot busier than we expected, since we assumed everyone would be at Sushi Rock. First, the menu is very extensive. It has everything from a la carte yakatori to tempera to soba. We order 3 rolls-- spicy tuna, green dragon and spider rolls. We also tried something from the Mongolian menu-- pan fried beef noodles. Overall, rolls were fresh and proportional.. didn't have to pinch off the rice. I def wanna try sashmi next time. However, the noodles fell short. Totally bland, lifeless, flatlined. 
Server was very attentive. May stick to the jap menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming here about once a week now. I woke up on a Monday morning about 2 months ago and felt like I didn't want to eat meat much anymore. Under water creatures used to creep me out and now I love them. I used to be really into aquariums and puffer fish so it is kind of weird that I enjoy eating them now. They are still nice living creatures. I guess if something has fur and limbs they seem more human-like. The sushi here is good as well as the Malaysian and Japanese menus."}
{"text":"Lucky we were on this trip to have Pacific East in the vicinity of our travels to stop in for dinner. Not enough Malaysian/East Pacific food in the US, and this place is a good one right in Cleveland. Plus, sushi and other Asian dishes. I ordered a tekka roll to try out their fish - very fresh and tightly wrapped. Our appetizer was agedashi-tofu - that sauce was special, for sure. I got the coconut butter jumbo scallops, which are breaded and deep fried scallops served with butter-fried coconut, crispy egg, and chilies. The coconut was super crispy and not sweet, and the chilies gave it a warm heat. Perfectly cooked scallops, too. Like the craziest Long John Silver's meal ever. Spouse ordered cumin lamb, which was dry-fried in cumin spices and served with lots a veggies and rice. Also delicious.

Our server was super-nice and very helpful and kept our meal going when our entrees came out at different times, and asked often how we liked our food, but didn't hover. Very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"I love their shrimp tempura sushi and spicy salmon sushi. Everyone there is also super nice. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, why I ask, who knows but I will be back real soon.   I have heard good things about Pacific East for years.   The service was good, the food better.   The place was packed on a weeknight, always a good sign.  We were seated promptly after arriving even though we did not have a rez.   Bevvies were brought out soon, orders taken, food showed up in a reasonable amount of time.   The food was great tasking and the right amounts without being too much or too little."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi place in Cleveland. The fish is always fresh and even if you're not in the mood for raw sushi, they have all sorts of variety to satisfy your desires."}
{"text":"We sadly don't eat here anymore. The service was just too sloppy and unapologetic. This place definitely needs better leadership and server training. 

It was once our favorite sushi place as it is very affordable. The quality is good enough to eat once a week. But the service...

The only server that won't mess something up, be rude, or forget something is the older Japanese lady. All the young-ins are pretty terrible. Sad..."}
{"text":"Last night I got the Beef Low Mein without any veggies. It was really good! I usually have to add some soy sauce to the food to make it taste better.  I didn't! It has a taste of it's own that is good without any thing added to it. 

I got a side salad too.  Their home made ginger salad dressing is so good that I ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone steadily downhill over the last couple years. the sushi is still very good but everything else is mediocre"}
{"text":"I love Malay food. BF loves Japanese. So this was a natural choice. 

Japanese: Ocean roll, tamago, scallop yakitori.
Malay: curry puff, okra & chicken special, chuy kway teo. 

And Thai tea. 

Everything was delicious. Only complaint was that I would've liked a bit more spice in the Malay dishes. The okra & chicken was the best dish imo. 

Definitely will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Had the chow kuey thew noodles. My to go too every time I make a stop here. Our server Moon was very attentive and quick at every request."}
{"text":"After a long break from Yelp, I'm back.  And had some of the best sushi in Cleveland here.  i would say that between this Pacific East and Parallax you'll find the best sushi in Cleveland.  Pacific East is much more along the lines of traditional Japanese cuisine.  The sushi is not Americanized but it is extremely fresh and you can tell from the first bite,  Sushi Rock, Shuhei or really no other sushi place i've been to in Cleveland.  I ordered the 18 piece deluxe sashimi combo.  I'm actually not sure what all it came with, I know there was some Tuna, and Salmon but i couldn't recognize any of the other fish but it was all very fresh, cold, meaty and tasty, no fishy smell or taste.  I also had a spicy salmon hand roll, this was my first hand roll and hopefully I'm not spoiled now because if every handroll tastes as good as the spicy salmon did I will likely not be eating any maki rolls anytime soon.  This is a must try if you enjoy sushi and happen to be in the Coventry area.  I want to say i have been to the other Pacific East on Chagrin Blvd and was not nearly as impressed, I need to go back to give it a second chance since I was there close to when it initially opened.  So given the choice make the trip to Coventry."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered has been on point. Servers come every two minutes, even if they're not yours. Which, I am not complaining. Its excellent service, I've never been left waiting. 
 The Malaysian cuisine is amazing. Its #2 in PAXn', number one in service. 
The atmosphere is very inviting. I love indulging in everything going on around me here, some places, I eat and go. Here I enjoy my stay. Thx Pacific East!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very well-made and super fresh. They could definitely make the rolls into 8 manageable slices instead of 6 huge pieces that create the appearance of swallowing a basketball! :-) But, other than that, the quality is top shelf. The dining area could use some updating for my taste, because spending $50 on lunch for two without alcohol means the carpet shouldn't be torn down the middle...ya think?"}
{"text":"I mean this as a compliment: this is probably the most likely place around Cleveland to get good sushi.  The Coventry location is always busy during dinner time--bustling with young Case students rockin' their American Apparel--which just about guarantees you fresh fish from the rapid turnaround alone.  MEOW!  Plus, they actually use short grain rice (trust me, there is a difference).  

So, my only gripe is with consistency.  Sometimes, the sushi is amazing, a handful of other occasions, though, no umami at all. What the hell?!  But I'll chalk this up to the decreasing availability of good fish.  However, if I think about this too much, I get depressed and guilt-ridden, and feel like there is nothing left to eat that doesn't adversely affect our environment. 

But I digress...I highly recommend the Ika-maru, the Uni, the Sapparo Reserve, and the Tempura Soba. 

One last recommendation: watch the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" about Jiro Ono, the first sushi chef to earn three Michelin stars and the owner of the alleged best sushi restaurant in the world (located in a Tokyo subway).  So, until I make my way Far East and turn into a real sushi snob (like my friend Young P. below), I'll make do with Pacific East, and so should you!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good for both quality and price.  Spider roll was good.
Don't try other Japanese dishes... especially katsu don.  It's the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pacific East was one of the main reasons I moved to Cleveland Heights and specifically this neighborhood. I love being able to walk down the street to get sushi, Thai food, etc. whenever I want. I crave sushi a lot. And you can't beat Pacific East's lunch specials.

Pacific East's sushi is always fresh. I have never had a bad roll here. I love ordering their Maki combo lunch special. You get two or three rolls plus soup and salad for just $9.95 or $12.95 respectively. If I want to venture from the combo choices the Green Dragon, Rainbow Roll or Volcano Roll are some of my go-to orders.

I could bathe in their ginger salad dressing. It is creamy and delicious and made in-house with 15 fruits and vegetables. I think this is hands down the best ginger salad dressing I have ever eaten. I'm always sad when I'm finished, and who says that about salad?

Their Malaysian menu is also enticing, and I have become seriously addicted to the Laksa ($9.95), which is a noodle bowl featuring tofu, shrimp and chicken in a curried coconut milk broth. This is just deliciousness in a bowl - and the $7.95 lunch special comes with an spring roll. I have been served both a normal spring roll and a Penang spring roll (curry and potato). I prefer the normal spring roll, but the Penang spring roll is an interesting variation.

With such an extensive menu there is something for everyone - even my mother with her dairy-free and gluten-free issues. They even brought their special gluten-free soy sauce out for her and said they could make anything for her with it but the teriyaki.

The servers are hit or miss. Sometimes I automatically get hot tea and sometimes I have to ask for it (see also: spring roll inconsistency). Sometimes there are communication problems. But I wouldn't have it any other way. Just bring me a salad and fresh sushi or the laksa and I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"This the second time we had lunch here in the past 12 month. This place brings bad memory each time. They do not have the capability to server big group (say 12 people). Lack of communication between kitchen and waiter/waitress easily messed up our order, and some of us have to wait 1 and half HOURS before the dish was serviced.

Regarding the food: It is OK, if you do not mind eating raw chicken."}
{"text":"The sushi here is the best I've found in Cleveland.  If you have a group, get a boat- they are just so cool and overflowing with food.  The miso soup and spicy tuna rolls are great."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for affordable yet high quality sushi. I got the ocean and American dream roll and didn't expect the pieces to be as big as they were. I liked the American dream roll more which had shrimp tempura. Each roll came with five pieces and was enough to get me full.

My group came in an hour before they were about to close because we mistakenly thought that they were open later. Unexpectedly, we were not rushed at all even when we were still eating past their closing time. Thanks Pacific East for your fantastic sushi and service!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi in Cleveland. Disturbed they only have 4 stars. For the price and the quality it is definitely my go to place. Get their combo roll meals! Everything is good but my favorite specialty rolls are jalapeño and Snow White. You can never go wrong with their spicy tuna and they are huge. 

The Thai menu is also delicious! I get the curry and it's to die for.

Their smoothies are thick and magical. I usually get them when I walk around Coventry."}
{"text":"I expected more in the way of ambiance for a restaurant at Eton.  But maybe die-hard sushi lovers don't require that....I did find the food to be really good.

We had the avacado salad which was great.

Golden Dream, Bomb and Ocean rolls.  All were really good (the Bomb was....the bomb! - awesome!).

Will probably make this a take out spot in the future."}
{"text":"Warning: these portion sizes are huge! Even the lunch size, which I got because I thought it would be smaller, was gigantic. On the bright side, you definitely get your money's worth.

So we had the beef pan fried noodles, the east roll, seafood pan fried noodles, and the pork pot (not sure what the actual name translates to from Chinese to English). The beef pan fried noodles were slices of rice noodle with beef slices: tasty, but generic fare for an Asian restaurant. I did get a spring roll with it, filled with the same filling you often find in samosas. I wasn't expecting it to have that kind of filling, but it tasted great! The east roll was a big (10 pieces) hot piece of sushi with egg, tempura, and other fish (can't remember exactly). Really good. Pork bowl was good, really flavorful, and the seafood noodles were crispy, dry thin noodles covered in clear sauce, big vegetable chunks, and seafood. Pretty decent.

Only downside was the milk bubble tea. The tea itself tasted really good, not so much milk that it was overpowering, so you could still taste the actual tea. However...the boba..mushy boba ruins any decent milk tea, to the point where I dragged my straw up to avoid drinking in any more boba. So that knocks my rating down a bit-what kind of Asian restaurant can't get bubble tea right?

Anyways, it was a pretty decent place with a really good amount of food for what you pay. Lots of leftovers, and it did mostly taste good."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh and delicious.  I didn't get anything fancy, just the assorted sashimi.  The decor was a bit lacking, but decor is low on my list of important aspects of a restaurant.  I look forward to going back and trying some of the Malay dishes."}
{"text":"Sushi is pricy but I love them! The quality is good. I also like the menu as it gives very clear introduction of what's inside of the dishes."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town! The employees are so nice and the dine-in as well as carry-out service is great! Fish is always fresh and great quality. I love both locations. This location seems to be a little bit cheaper than chagrin? Maybe because less rent?  Clearly a Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi slut but I have been around the sushi block a few times. This place is a gem: features Malaysian menu in addition to a very fresh sushi chopping block. Probably the best sushi I've had here in CLE. Ginger dressing is heavenly I could literally drink it from a straw. It gets pretty busy and I've ordered ahead many times. The place is good for large parties, parking sucks though
: no dedicated parking lot."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was recommended by a local in the street. Who knew you could get good sushi in Cleveland. The sushi was fresh and good size. We shared 2 rolls the Alaska and the spicy roll. We then ordered okra with beef in garlic sauce. It was delicious!  Recommend by the waitress. They even made it gluten and soy free. They even recommended the house saki which was great and the least expensive alcohol on the menu. 
I will definitely be back!!!"}
