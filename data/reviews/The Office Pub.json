{"text":"I've been to the Office Pub at least 10 times within the last two years mostly for food.

I like this place, however, the food is not consistent and that makes me afraid to suggest this place to anyone. As far as I have experienced;

-The Half Price Wings. They used SMALLER wings for this special. I know the regular priced wings are much bigger. Hmmm...

-I went in recently, the sweet potato fries (which used to be my favorite!) is different. Much smaller, less crunchy, less salty, LESS GOOD. 

-Monday burger deal. The meat is NOT GOOD. I guess it's still a good deal, just don't expect too much..."}
{"text":"This place was the WORST! Horrible service and THEY DIDNT HAVE BLUE CHEESE?! I can't even believe I'm giving this place one star.......there isn't even light in there , you would only like it there if you were a vampire. The waitress we had was a little baby!!!!! She cried because I threatened to leave...she also almost stole my purse...bunch of thieves....UNBELIEVABLE DONT GO THERE"}
{"text":"Ordered their vegetarian burger through Uber Eats. It arrived within 20 minutes and was absolutely better than I expected. Have never been to their physical location but their food rocks in my opinion.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"The prices were great, and is the main reason for the three stars. The drinks were pretty good too, and the appetizers were tasty.

However, after trying 4 different pasta dishes, I'm convinced that they don't know how to cook pasta. Their best pasta was the ravioli a la vodka, but even that had a weird hard texture to it. My pasta with boar sausage was gritty and the noodles felt like they'd been reheated. The gnocci was so tough it was mostly inedible.

I plan to go back once more, because the appetizers were good and I haven't tried their non-pasta menu yet. But please, avoid all the pasta til they learn how to make it properly.

The atmosphere is also confusing. It's divided into several sections each with a different style. And really, after a long day at work, who would want to go to a place called \"The Office\"? It's just a strange idea."}
{"text":"food is soso. been here a few times for the toronto Meetups.
really crap service
The theme is so strange. Is this place a karaoke bar? an office to go to after you leave the first office of your workplace?? an upscale lounge with sub par service..? 
It's too bad, the people at the meetups are so fun and lovely, but just out of boredom of this crappy venue i wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"Just finished paying my bill and Alexandra decided to throw on a 15% gratuity for herself 'there was just three of us'. Being a bartender myself and my girlfriend a server, this was a tad ludicrous. We did not notice right away and still tipped 20%. Long and short, hope she enjoys the money."}
{"text":"The bartender on the second floor on February 11, 2017 continuously harassed patrons for tips. When they didn't tip, he gave poor service and served below board drinks. If you are looking to be harassed and berated, try out The Office Pub on a Saturday. Otherwise, there are many other places in the city. 

My wife went home and cried because of this experience, I hope you feel good about yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty good food
Horrible service
Weird identity.  What is this place?  A golf club?  A karaoke bar?  A place to do work?  
Pretty good food.
Horrible service."}
{"text":"We arrived as a (reserved) group of 75+ and were immediately greeted with negativity. The wait/bar staff were rude from the beginning. The beer (pints) were overpriced, the bathrooms were single occupancy and some were unavailable. As we arrived, one of my friends wasn't feeling well (Didn't drink, dehydrated), so we took her out to the stairwell to get fresh air and drink some water. As we got her seated, a staff member came out to the stairs and said \"no drinks out here\". We told him she hadn't drank and needed some water, he grabbed the water and went inside. As our friend felt faint and needed to sit, another staffer came over and said she was in the way and had to move. He could've went around the stairs, but made her stand and move. After she had felt better, we went inside and were invited with dirty looks by the terrible working staff at the second level bar. Later in the night, our other friend was threatened to be kicked out, after she had been neglected of bar service and joked about filling her own glass. They said she stole alcohol and needed to leave. 
They were unaware of the clients, extremely rude to everyone, and couldn't seem to grasp human sympathy for someone who felt incredibly ill. 

They're lucky Yelp does obtain a zero star rating. 
Never returning."}
{"text":"I came here for a work party, ironically enough.  It's a good space--nice upstairs deck, cozy bar space, and a quiet downstairs to get away from the crowd should you need it."}
{"text":"Drinks and food are reasonably priced. Nothing special here. Nice small patio and good for people watching on Queen street."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday for a birthday party (first time, evening). When I first got there the service from the two assigned bartenders/waitresses was fine (in the beginning) and then an hour later their attitudes just became sour. They were rude, inconsistent with their service - I was able to get a glass of water but my friend was told later that they don't serve water...wtf? Maybe we didn't give them enough tips, I don't know but regardless they need a lesson in customer service. Aside from the horrible service the food was good. Majority of people ordered the fish tacos and wings and no complaints."}
{"text":"The patio is perfect for the summer  I had chicken tacos which was sooo delicious and my husband ordered sth also so goooood. I don't remember the name but it included rice,chicken curry and bread. The girls were so nice and helpful.they gave us 20% off due to confusion  . It's a beautiful place to have fun and eat good food"}
{"text":"Had takeout.  Pulled pork is very good but the desserts were shockingly excellent.   I have to say that the red velvet cake and the peanut butt cake were two of the best desserts I've ever had.  Fresh and fantastic"}
{"text":"Love the wait staff, great environment, very cool back patio.

They stock great beers and the menu is top notch. Love the pretzel bread sandwiches and anything that involves curry.

This is my go-to place to relax with a pint downtown."}
{"text":"This is concerning Caraoke only. I got there 930 pm on friday night and got in line with my friend. after 2 hrs ( close to 1 am) my friend's turn came ( which was surprising cause I saw on the monitor that we were about 10th in line which i though was 1 hr max). But my turn didnt come at all after my friend went and finally when my friends decided to leave close to 2 pm. I went up and the dj said I was next. I heard that you need to go and constantly keep reminding them that you are there. Absurd!"}
{"text":"Location: On John south of Queen. Definitely a \"walk to\" location. If your'e from out of town, parking is a nightmare. On average you will find $20 rates.

Food Quality & Price: Dishes were pricey but food was decent. Drinks seem to be \"lacking\". Every time I asked for a drink, I was told they didn't have such and such alcohol. 

Facility: Both the second and third floors seem to have poor sight lines. If I had to choose, the third floor would be my preference. One giant open space for kareoke and dancing vs the second floor where you mainly sit then sing. Atmosphere is bar-like. Dim lighting, loud music, very crowded. Washrooms are a horror. They are only single occupancy and the toilet clogs often. They need to be regularly checked/cleaned to a standard.

Service: Servers/Bartenders were not necessarily cold but definitely not warm or welcoming. The staff basically don't care, so good luck to whoever owns this actual place. Staffing needs an overhaul, bad for business. The DJ at the time was pretty rude. He plain out ignored the women who came up to request/ask about songs in queue and talked mostly with guys. Several of my friends requested songs which took him over an hour to play. When I went up to ask how many were in front, I could see him deleting requests. Also, some friends who requested before me had their song played long after mine. 

Overall: The overall impression The Office Pub left me with, from their bouncers to their DJ, was a \"don't care\" attitude. Borderline rude, actually. I wouldn't return to this establishment unless my friends happen to come here. And even then, I would definitely be thinking twice about spending money inside."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent bar in the entertainment district, with multiple levels. The food and drink selection is fairly standard for the entertainment district, nothing that really stands out.

I will say that their patio is a good choice for some $5 pints and lots of sun."}
{"text":"This year we decided to try a new place to hold our annual Christmas party for our law firm. We decided to give the Office Pub a try even though it's a bit far from where our offices are (ie on the east side of Yonge). 

We chartered a bus for about 60 of us. When we got there the appetizers were waiting for us as promised.  The management was great as were the servers who were always nearby to make sure we were ok. They provided a great Karaoke DJ and what would have been a humdrum Christmas lunch turned into a full blown party. 

The food was great, everyone had a great time, and the music didn't stop until the last person was all sung out!  Definitely the best Christmas party we have had in 20+ years. The compliments from our staff are still pouring in. Will definitely be back. 

Price was comparable to what we have paid in the past but we got way more this year in value and memories. Recommending it highly!"}
{"text":"The only good thing I have to say is the food was pretty good and cheap. My girlfriend and I both had sandwichs and a couple of drinks for about $35, so not bad. The thing that really got us was the service! It was ridiculous. Slow, thoughtless, dumb, need I go on?"}
{"text":"The bouncers need to pay a bit more attention to the folks there. While I was there, there was a man pestering me about not buying him drinks, to a point where he was calling us names and making homophobic slurs. It's a shame that someone like that will ruin an evening. The bar has a great environment and atmosphere. Just some of the folks should have been booted long ago."}
{"text":"$4 mix drinks.

Yes please. My friends love meeting up on a thursday night right after work. Its great for cheap drinks and a quick bite! 

I usually come between 4pm-6pm and its not too packed. We always managed to get seats for 3. 

Good spot for a drank! 

Happy belly :)"}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers for lunch on a Friday and surprisingly this place was empty! Servers were standing around looking bored and they were playing \"Say Something\" on loudspeakers... A little depressing for a pub setting..

We were seated and right away I noticed the broad variety offered in their menu. There was tandoori dishes to seafood nachos to lumberjack burgers and plenty of pasta options. 

I opted for the sausage pulled pork penne because it contains my favorite choices of protein. It was served with two pieces of garlic bread which was cold and hard. The penne was drenched in the sour pulled pork sauce, making the dish too overpowering to the taste. The onions and sausage all tasted like the pulled pork sauce as well. My mistake, I should not have ordered pasta at a \"pub\" but again, they should take this dish off their menu. 

My coworkers enjoyed their Lumberjack Burgers and chicken fingers. The buffalo chicken nachos we ordered to share was A-OK but the chips were stale.. I would have preferred my nachos to be crunchy. 

Our server also had really bad memory of who ordered what and food took forever to come (even though we were the only ones at the restaurant). 

Well, I can see why nobody comes here for their sad choice of music, not to mention inability to cater to the office lunch crowd who only have an hour to eat and get back to the office. If I do venture back here, I'll order some actual pub grub and NOT pasta."}
{"text":"Visited a while ago with my boyfriend and our friend. The restaurant was quite full especially for a weekday night, but we were quickly seated and served by our server!

Food
The menu itself wasn't the most extensive I've seen, but definitely had it's fair share of good pub food. I believed I ordered my go-to pub food, Fish-and-Chips while my boyfriend got their Chicken Parm. Our food arrived fairly quickly even though the restaurant was quite busy. My boyfriend said his chicken parm is worth the money, while I believed my fish-and-chips was okay at best. The fish itself seemed to be over-fried and was incredibly flaky but the fries was great.

Atmosphere/Experience
During our time there, the restaurant itself seemed to only have two or three servers. Our server served the entire dining room all by herself but was able to provide exceptional service. My low rating came about due to what happened when the bill arrived. After inputting the bill amount into the credit/debit card machine, she happened to also input the tip amount as well before asking \"you tip 15%, ok?\", seemingly as to DEMAND me to tip her her desired amount. I have never had this happened to me where I was forced to tip a certain percentage and I felt pretty awful afterwards. I had no problems tipping her such amount because she was incredibly good with her service, but demanding a customer to tip you whatever you want is really not appropriate and professional.

The atmosphere of the restaurant however, was quite nice. Sports were on display on most of the TVs in the restaurant, and the decoration is also quite nice."}
{"text":"Went for NYE. There was supposed to be $4 drinks and free champagne, so it sounded good.
First impression was that it seemed less douchebaggy than some other places downtown so that's ok. Big crowd of different people. 

However for so many people on the one floor there was only one bartender. So there was a big line up. We waited for around 20min just to get one drink and apparently we couldn't get the $4 price because as we were waiting it became after 11, which is stupid at least seeing as we were in line.

Music was meh, some weird mix of random nineties stuff and then some ok dubsteb and hiphop stuff on the upper floor. Wasn't that bad but just ok.

They didn't advertise the free champagne inside though so we had to ask at the bar to get it. But we still got it so that's fine. Just seemed kind of sneaky.

My major problem was that hey had signs for Magners and Somersby cider but didn't actually have any? wtf? I don't like beer.. so sad for false advertising.

Had an alright time despite this though. A solid.. two stars. Not sure if I like it enough to return but it may get another chance if the ciders actually come back."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft beer, and decent prices. But terribly slow service. Seemed to be almost ignored by staff."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here on a Thursday night. We came in and ordered a total of 3 drinks each before they decided to refuse service to us because we were \"too intoxicated\". 

On top of that, the two waitresses behind the bar were very rude. I have never been ignored and given such attitude at a bar in my life. Not only were we not intoxicated when we got there ( and when we left ) we tried to be respectable customers. 

This is my first negative review, and I'm saddened to say I do not recommend this bar at all."}
{"text":"Went here for Karaoke on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday party. Great crowd (20s and 30s), casual and not pretentious like other downtown places, large selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Ok place but need to work on their math. What's the tax to a drink say $4 for example..... Well youre charged $4.75 per that said $4 drink. Hmmmm ok?!"}
{"text":"I frequent here often. Drinks are decent, but the food during our last visit took a surprisingly long time and we just cancelled our order."}
{"text":"I was pretty sure I had yelped about this place previously but guess it was on my list of things to yelp and never got done.

So yeah the name sucks, so maybe it is a way to attract suits after 5pm as there is nothing officey about the pub.

Me and my friend were seated pretty quick and the service was quick and polite.

I remember ordering a lamb burger, and some starters which I can no longer remember but overall the food was nothing special.

The burger itself looked great and started off nice but the closer I got to the centre the more rawer it seemed to get. Have yet to find anywhere that nails a New Zealand lamb burger bet than me.

Anyway the outside patio consisted of wobbly chairs and tables but still nice enough to sit out but was soon annoyed by some private party going on in the 2nd floor so had to contend with some drums beating and people shouting. 

Ruined what would have been an okay experience."}
{"text":"Food was decent for a bar and the hostess was absolutely lovely but the service was horrible and the bouncer slash possibly manager fully insulted our intelligence when we tried to use our yelp discounts."}
{"text":"Terrible location for an event or large gathering. Otherwise fairly standard bar, not worth a special trip but not worth avoiding if directly outside."}
{"text":"We went here after a TIFF show where they pushed the pub both in the MC's speech and as well on the big screen so there was a definite connection to TIFF. This is the typical Toronto pub in an old building with rickety staircases, meaning two staircases that lead to the upper floors which is very cool, giving it an almost house party, or haunted house, feel. The tiny front patio functions as the smoking area which has stairs leading up to the door way similar to a Victorian house lining downtown residential streets of To. The pub was adorned with token Halloween decorations when we visited and the tables had candles making the atmosphere dark and cozy, and at the same time creepy too. The fries and burger was good, typical and ok, the drinks just fine. Interesting that they have a projector and screen which look to be installed permanently upstairs. And after reading the reviews, I'd like to go back for the wings!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Awkward seating. Limited selection for drinks. Poutine was good. Service was good."}
{"text":"Disgusting is one word to summarize this place.

The waitresses on the main floor harass you every 15 seconds to order food/drinks. The food tastes like old cardboard. 

Upstairs is a karaoke bar. The bartenders are rude, drinks are overpriced, 90% of patrons have had too many drinks. 

Save your money and your ears."}
{"text":"Ended up this place as we wanted to grab a quick bite and the Thai place close by known for notorious waits was closed for a private event.
Ah well check in revealed they had a special offer for Yelpers.
Walking in the space is big and is a roomy two floors but had a sparse crowd on Friday evening at prime hours (never a good sign). We were able to pick a spot for us and after going through their menu and hearing the specials I ordered their namesake burger while my dinning partner ordered a Chicken Alfredo.  I also ordered a pint of Kronnenberg which was on special.
The setup is clean and is kind of confusing as its not really a pub vibe more of a cross between a restaurant with a fusion theme if you ask me. 
Service was decent as we were checked on regularly and the food arrived promptly. The burger is just your run of a mill stuff, the substitute of sweet potato fries were decent. My fellow diner enjoyed his alfredo.
So why the 2 stars? I am not sure what they are going for here as its neither pub grub/ambiance with good beer selection nor is it a proper restaurant as the menu is tired. 
Folks unless they make major change if you want to see a restaurant in decay this is it."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends on the patio, so I never went inside. Patio is small, but has a lot of tables. They're small tables, so you can move them around to accommodate your party.

Service was good, beer selection was decent. Ask what's on special that day for a great deal on beer. Didn't have food, but everything that was in the area looked delicious. 

A relaxing patio to grab some drinks!"}
{"text":"I had fish and chips and a beer. The fish was a bit too greasy for me, but very standard for pub food. The atmosphere was as expected. Nothing good or bad stood out for me. If you're at/near John Street looking for a pub and have no preference (there are other pubs next door like Jack Astor), I would suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Came here by chance and ended up on the second floor with the karaoke last weekend. Its an interesting spot, and was full of bachelorette party's and bros who were too sketchy for the surrounding clubs. Not really my preferred venue , but good if you like dirt mcgirt Karaoke."}
{"text":"This pub has a great set up and has a solid selection of beers on tap. The upstairs has limited seating so it may be a wait but it was a good spot for the event that we went to"}
{"text":"I can't talk about or rate the service, staff or the location myself, as we took a gamble late one Saturday night and ordered food from here via Just Eat, the food arrived quickly, and was fresh and carefully assembled. 

I had the Great Aussie Burger which was pretty damn delicious!  the fries were fresh cut and double fried and arrived surprisingly crispy for delivery. My buddy ordered the curry chicken poutine and was very happy with it, he said the curry was delicious, both of us found the portions were very good and the quality was also very good for a pub. 

I can't really complain about anything here. I enjoyed my burger, it was really tasty as well as the fries. To be honest we were not expecting 5 star restaurant food from here, but what we got was much better quality than we expected.  

I may pop in at some point just to see what all the poor reviews are about here. 

Overall my experience was very good and I will return again."}
{"text":"We stopped by here pretty late (around 1am) and we asked to sit outside, so they took us to the back of the restaurant in the corner. 15 minutes later, someone arrived to take our order... when we finally got our drinks, within the next 15 minutes the waitress comes by again and says \"you asked for the bills? here they are.\" even though none of us asked for it. Either way, we paid it, and tried to have a conversation with her to ask how her night was going, but she was in a very grumpy mood and had no interest in talking to us.

So we checked out the Karaoke upstairs, they went till about 2am, and then we headed back. The karaoke was fun, even though none of us went up to sing, we sang along in our seats!

I probably wouldn't stop by here again, since there was nothing about this place that made us want to come back."}
{"text":"Have been here now twice with the same experience.  The service is very sub-par.  I think the servers stand around and see it as some sort of social event rather than realizing they are there to do a job. 

 Right off the get go I noticed that the water glasses looked cloudy.  The food was warm, which meant the cheese dip had started to harden and it was nothing special.  The french fries were good (its almost impossible to get fries wrong)  but everything else was below expectations. 

 I believe that they really must rely on tourists and one-offs as I don't see any reason for downtown patrons to return, given all of the establishments that is to offer in that area."}
{"text":"Creative drink menu, and you have to try the chicken curry poutine! During our quick weekend in TO we stopped by twice!"}
{"text":"Visited all the way from houston, tx on a thursday. There was not much movement around so we decided to hop on this bar since it seemed more alive than the rest. I don't really like karaoke nights anywhere, I myself have not ever sung karaoke. But this bar had a pretty good crowd, everyone enjoyed the night, danced and everything. Drink prices were ok, but the drinks were good. We had a good time."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend at the Office Pub after work to grab food and drinks before going to the Canadian Premier of Race in Toronto which was held at Scotiabank Theatre.  Was excited to see Jason Sudeikis in person and hoping that he would bring Olivia Wilde with him too.  Unfortunately, she didn't show up.  

My friend and I sat at the bar where they have a bunch of flat screen TV's playing sports.  It was Thursday and they had pints of Rickards Red and MGD for $5.50 and $2 Wings (Buy a pound at regular price and get the 2nd for $2).  So I ordered a pint of MGD and got 2 lbs of wings.  I got 1 lb each of honey garlic and smoked honey bbq.  

2 lbs of wings ($14.99, Thursday Wing Special) - the wings were lightly breaded, big, meaty and juicy.  I really like the flavours of the sauce and that the wings were not overly drenched in sauce which I like.  

I definitely recommend coming here for their Thursday Wing Special if you're in the area.

Tip:  If you check-in on Yelp, you get $10 off your Food order of $30 I believe."}
{"text":"I have had a couple of parties here.  The space is beautiful.  The staff were helpful.  But the management is disorganized and both times there were major confusions about location in the pub and start times.  They may throw your party in the middle of karaoke or speed dating and not tell you.  And the first time no one even told me there was a third floor available.  I'd use it again but only after calling several times to speak to each staff member, as they don't seem to be talking to each other.  Even after speaking to the manager the day before the party twice, they still didn't know when we were coming, so I felt bad for our bartender as he was suddenly blasted by surprise guests.  Then during the event there were people walking into my party as no one seemed to know where each party was supposed to be, there were only 2 parties happening.  I was told there would be signs for each party.  It was very frustrating.  I'd use this pub again as it is gorgeous, but i'm quite confused as to how something so simple turned into quite a stressful experience."}
{"text":"Be 25 and under! Fun place, cheap drinks, Shakti is a fun dj. Heart of the club district"}
{"text":"The drinks are pricier than I'd like and early on in the night it's really dead. After midnight it fills up more and is more fun but it's not to great for small groups. Big groups would have a good time here but when it was just 3 of us it was quite a bore. Usually the biggest group takes over and you feel like a guest at a party you weren't invited to."}
{"text":"Come here for the friday drink specials, which are great considering you are right beside Adelaide and the clubs. The food here is mediocre though, ordered the nachos and took a half hour to come...it's nachos and there's not that many people here. Will come again but will leave the munchies for another place."}
{"text":"Good service, but not so great food.

This was a decent place to hang out with the Hubster. We were both a little hungry, so he got the burger, which was fine, and I got the mussels, which were incredibly salty. 

Everything else about this place was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Awesome time with friends on a karaoke night. Great drinks, good food, and damn near every song you could ever think of to sing along with while wasted with your friends . Definitely going again."}
{"text":"I live close to The Office Pub so decided to try it out.  It's sort of dingy looking inside and the food wasn't spectacular but the prices are reasonable.  Our fries were kind of soggy but the burgers tasted ok.  The service was good and they had some good beer specials on the night we visited.  It's a decent place to go for a few drinks but I don't think I would eat dinner here again."}
{"text":"I went here for the no pants subway after party. So I cannot review this based on an average night. 

That being said the venue was small but not over crowded, the drinks were a bit above average in price but still fairly priced and the selection was good. The place was kept clean and the staff were fast and friendly.

I would definitely come check this place out again"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times recently for some nightly drinks after events and it's got a few good things going for it: 
Great location
Good prices for said great location
Good spot to reserve the upper floors for private events (which was my experience) 
Staff were not frazzled on busy days. 
Fun vibe, on my second night, a group had booked a floor for some karaoke that looked mighty fun!

The not so great: 
Minimum $20 purchases for card transactions, probably not an issue for most but not great if you just want 1 drink and are all out of cash. 
It can get very hot with a packed house (second floor).
Food menu was lacking, but good for late night eats.

Overall, it's a solid pub, I would still prefer heading to the Town Crier next door for their superior drink selection, food and vibe, but The Office Pub is popular to be booked for private events and it doesn't have any major flaws that would have me saying \"never going there again\"."}
{"text":"If you need, I mean, NEED, to have a drink with a larger group of people (8+) right in the heart of downtown, The Office Pub is your best bet, but that's not saying very much. The food is basically exactly what you'd expect at a local pub, the variety of food offerings is pretty nominal, they do carry some local craft brews on tap but the selections are generally pretty tame. The servers are in high rotation, the washrooms aren't always the cleanest, it's just pretty mediocre overall. But if size matters, this might be the most convenient place to be."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks after work on a Friday. Patio was packed but managed to grab a table in the shade which was perfect. As I mentioned, we came merely for drinks...We ordered a pitcher of sangria. I typically feel that red sangria is a bit difficult to perfect so it's always best to go for the white unless you're absolutely certain about the location. Unfortunately this was a lose-lose. We ordered the white and the first taste was a refreshing -- it literally tasted like Hawaiian Punch, but that's not really the taste I'm going for in sangria. By the end of the pitcher I was feeling horrendous due to the excessive amount of sugar. 

We also didn't even stick around for the bill. I will give our server a small break, it was really busy but we ended up just leaving the amount on the table and heading out. 

Perhaps stay away from the mixed cocktails that's on the menu and go with wine...or beer...or vodka. That can't go wrong, right?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's a really cheap place if you wanna get drunk on a budget. In the middle of the clubbing district, you can order you carbs after a night of drinking. 

Washroom is by the kitchen downstairs which is a bit weird..."}
{"text":"I am absolutely appalled. We came here for an event that our college planned and half of us weren't even allowed in even though we bought tickets. After we finally did get the majority in, I was standing at the bar waiting to order a drink and the bartender comes up to me and says \"I find it so strange that you're staring at me, stop.\" You WISH I was staring at you! You probably haven't gotten a second glance in years! I was simply standing there waiting to order my drink! Please don't get ahead of yourself, loser. Now I am standing at the bar feeling marginalized, harassed, and uncomfortable (and still without a drink, rrrgggg). The management was TERRIBLE, they knew NOTHING and were unhelpful during our entire event and everyone couldn't wait to blow that sad sweaty sack of a pub off to move on to another one. We all left extremely disappointed and disgusted. Will not return, nor will I recommend to anyone to go there. The only recommendation I would give is to AVOID this place like the plague it is."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is great pub food and the drafts are endless. The pretzel and meat plate is where it's at. 

I ordered the tuna steak sandwich and I enjoyed it but am sad that they cook it all the way through every time. It should be a little pink or it becomes too dry. 

I do recommend this place. It good quality."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim just walking down John street, hungry after a show at second city. Great choice. I had a somersby sangria (wine and cider are two of my favorite things so big win!) food wise my hubby got hot wings and onion rings which were obviously good because he ate it much to fast for me to taste. He really like the sauce that came with the onion rings. I got the chicken penne which was also very good. Waitstaff was friendly and food came out surprisingly quick. If I'm ever in the area I would stop in again. I can't speak to peak timing as this was a Wednesday night at 10:30 pm."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, once for a work party and a couple birthdays. San is really good at accommodating large groups. 

Food - I recommend the spring rolls, Mediterranean flatbread, and the lamb nachos - very delicious! However, the other foods that I've tried there weren't very impressive. 

Drinks - the usual here. Bartenders were very excellent. 

Music - Actually, they do karaoke! It can be a lot of fun if you're with a big group.

Location - They have a nice patio outside on the upper level. And a dancing level that's above the karaoke level, although when we went, there was no one up there except us!

3 stars because the food was a hit or a miss, and the place is alright - nothing to write home about. If you're looking for something with a bit more charm, then there are loads of other places nearby."}
{"text":"I went there once with a group upstairs, and found that they have only TWO TOILETS for the ENTIRE place. One for female and one for male! Not two washrooms, two rooms with one toilet in each. For a bar that holds how many hundred people, is this even legal? I asked two different waiters, then had to go downstairs to ask two bartenders for a Margareta and it was the biggest problem of their life to make one. You'd think I'd asked for a glass of gasoline. 
Because of the brick walls, this place has terrible and loud acoustics.
Better watch your fluid intake in this place...."}
{"text":"Drinks and fries were passable, but the service was really, really slow for how busy it was (absolutely empty)! 

This place is trying to be too many different things at once, and is bad at all of them. The lighting is dark and tables are candlelit, yet they're loudly playing top 40s music AND the excessive amount of TVs has the game on AND there's music leaking from the upstairs karaoke? I'm so confused."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Worst bar food in the city, and karaoke is awful. The guy will yell at you, like really yell at you, for asking for a song. You will definitely get sick from the food. Everyone is rude, it's loud and the crowd is all barely of age to drink (definitely some under age people there too). I would not recommend going, and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food was all right (nothing special but good) and I ordered the sangria which was amazing! Would definitely return but not too soon."}
{"text":"5 stars to their bartender and 1 to the servers:)

Stopped by one Friday night for a couple of drinks. Me and my girlfriend ordered a mojito and their version of amaretto sour. The cocktails were actually pretty good (mine was $13, hers was $5), and they served them in those cute little jars. 
Our server was terribly slow and she couldn't tell us what's in the menu. It seemed like she just didn't care about what's going on. Anyway... 

Unless they hire new servers I doubt that I'm ever going to go there again."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday, my friends and I had a blast here! We were originally planning to go to the Ballroom but was packed so we came here instead. We sat downstairs for a bit to drink and the bar rail drinks were $4 (on a Friday). They had really adorable glass jars for the cocktails which was refreshing to see. Our waitress was nice and told us about the specials they had. One thing I didn't like was that our table was at the far back corner and it was SO dark, I had to use my phone to read the menu. 

We went upstairs after to do karaoke and we got a bunch of songs in. The waits to perform songs was surprisingly not too long! And everyone there was singing along to the songs which was fun to watch. Unfortunately, as many of the reviews state, the service is not that great. The bartenders were rude and seemed incredibly grumpy to be there. I was also not informed that drink prices go up (from $4.50 upstairs to $6.50 for the bar rail drinks after 11pm) and was rudely told this by the bartender. I'd come here again despite the service as the karaoke was really fun."}
{"text":"Average pub at a great location. They have a good list of drinks, and the fried chicken was yummy.  It's a spot where you can get cheap food & drinks after work in downtown. 

They also have a backyard, but it's usually crowded."}
{"text":"Beers were only $5.50 each when my friend and I went on a Tuesday night. Our waitress was great. She checked up on us every time our beer glasses had an inch left. Their food is fairly standard pub food. Nothing amazing or noteworthy. I prefer this location over King East's."}
{"text":"It's a decent place for beer and food at an affordable price. 

The food is good for pub fare it's easily 7/10 if not slightly better.

The beer selection is 90% domestic with a couple of imported gems. As a guy who likes craft beer it's pretty slim though they do have Grandville Island on tap which is a rare find.

Service  - I have gone there about 6 times and half the time had a good experience. I would recommend sitting near the bar not to the left where there is a mood dinning area where the services is bad and acoustics are terrible. 

Near the bar there are some tables and the bar tender will fill you up right away.  In the other area is seems to be a challenge to get  a server's attention and your drink filled up. Last Thursday I waited 15 minutes to get ketchup, if might be the acoustics but our sever walked away as we were ordering 3 times. 

Not a bad place but the last experience was so bad I wouldn't return given there are plenty of similar places to go in the area."}
{"text":"A Nice Surprise - We stopped by The Office Pub on our walking tour of Toronto.  We were just looking for a simple meal.  What we found was surprisingly good.  My wife and I both enjoyed our meal.  We sat outside but it started to rain.  They were happy to move us inside.  Service was very attentive.  If I was back in this neighborhood I would certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"I came here for a networking event. I have a physical disability and was very disappointed and upset the venue is completely not accessible (event was on the third floor)!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends after seeing a movie at the nearby Scotiabank theatre. The patio was an excellent hang out spot on a sunny afternoon. 

They had a couple of beers on special and mixed drinks were only $4. We ordered Mexican fries to share. Drinks were a good deal, but the fries were kind of a disappointment. Basic fries, topped with salsa, tomatoes, guacamole, and sour cream. Basically nachos, but with fries. 

Bottom-line: this place is alright if all you want is drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"A non-franchise pub in a popular area of central downtown. An easy place to grab a drink or a meal before heading to the theater or a movie. 

Dropped by on a Monday night for a quick meal and found the place mostly empty. We chose to sit on the bar side (plenty of screens on the latest sports event) and picked some cheap beers to go with the feature meals of the night. My dining buddy had the featured philly cheesesteak sandwich and really liked his meal. I remember liking my meal (but have since forgotten what I got). 

The patio outside looks like a good place to people watch on a sunny day. Convenient, predictable and can provide for all your eating/drinking needs."}
{"text":"Grab a seat by the window, great happy hour special and free wifi!  Lovely place for dining alone!"}
{"text":"The quality of food was average. But the service was terrible. Asked for water; took the server 20 minutes to grab it. And the glasses were filthy. The sever was not courteous at all."}
{"text":"I had read on Twitter that the Indian food at the Office Pub was supposed to be surprisingly good, so I'd been angling for an excuse to hit the joint for weeks. A friend wanted to meet for lunch in the area and I jumped at the chance to finally sample the Office Pub's wares.

The surprisingly extensive menu contains plenty of promising-looking items, but I finally decided to go with the Kothu Rotti (Roti, onions, cabbage, eggs, and chicken curry). 

The first thing I noticed when the food arrived is that the roti connection is seemingly absent, as the food is prepared like a hash and placed on a plate. My experience with roti in the past has always involved a filling of some sort placed inside a naan-like wrap, so it did take me a second to figure out just what I was looking at here.

Once I got past the surprise of the presentation, I was left with a very enjoyable and very tasty Indian-themed hash. The ingredients used were all top-notch and the side curry sauce was extremely flavorful and contained just the right amount of spice.

The lack of crispy bits was a little disappointing, admittedly, but their absence wasn't something I really dwelled on. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5, stars actually.   Walked in here when my sister and I saw a karaoke sign.  However at about 9pm it was completely dead.  Nonetheless, I liked the decor of the downstairs (despite the fact that it was almost unbearably hot) so we decided to stay for a while.  About an hour after we got there, upstairs was packed so we just decided to stay downstairs.  We had awesome service (we had a blonde bartender whose name I forgot but she was super awesome!).  I agree with some other comments that this place can't quite figure out what way it wants to go and it may get more stars if it has a firm direction.  We didn't get food so can't comment on that, but decent Shiraz and cool drinks.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came in for their wings deal - you buy one pound of wings and get the second pound for $2. The patio was pretty nice - it's connected to the Town Crier Patio and the Pizzaiolo patio, so the end result is an area of very loud drinkers. 

We would have ordered beers, but all of their domestic bottles and cans seemed way overpriced, even for a restaurant. The wings came and were awesome, though. Definitely worth the trip - we got the Hickory BBQ, which was tangy and sweet, and the Hot n' Honey (or something like that) which was sweet with a stingy kick to it. The wings were the kind that were deep fried before they were soaked in sauce, so they were delicious and crunchy. Came with a few carrot and celery spears, and also some Ranch. I think only complaint was that they were a little small."}
{"text":"We were walking downtown on a Friday night and decided to come here for supper. It is located in an older building so it makes for a nice atmosphere. The lighting is a bit dark and it was quite noisy.  My wife had the goat curry wrap and I had the fish and chips.   She enjoyed her wrap but said it was a bit spicier than was she usually likes.  My fish and chips was good, especially the coleslaw that came with it. Overall it was a nice meal with reasonable prices. The waitress was busy so we had to flag her a few times."}
{"text":"I would EASILY give this place 4 stars. We come here often, the drinks are affordable, the bar staff & wait staff are generally pleasant & the food is good. My biggest issue, and it's a biggie, is that EVERY TIME I am there, the bathrooms flood/stop flushing/stop working etc. 

They really need to invest in getting some functioning bathrooms & I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place mainly for the beers - name says it all, it's a great place to get a drink after work but I wouldn't plan a night out here for dinner.  It's dark, kind of hidden but awesome to just relax and have a couple drinks"}
{"text":"Food was alright, it came out relatively quick. Not bad overall, but for the price you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a monday night and I liked, the waitress was helpful and gave tips to what beer to ask, the chicken wings were good too."}
{"text":"I'm between 2 and 3 stars, but let's keep it at 3 to give credit to the exceptions of some good waitresses they have (see below)

It's a good place to watch games, with good screens, however I have to agree with the average comment on here that the service generally is bad. Some waitresses are good (exceptions), but usually there seems to be a lack of interest in the customers. 

Food it ok, 3 out of 5, nothing special

However I finally decided to review the palace after watching our 3rd COPA game here: since the service was below par, I tipped accordingly (8%, not like I didn't tip, just lower to send the message). Which the waitress apparently got since after printing the receipt she \"threw\" it at the table without saying a word, and walked away. That's a no -go in my opinion."}
{"text":"This afternoon, my husband we checked out The Office Pub.

It opened two weeks ago on John Street, just south of Richmond E.

We sat on the patio, which was a great place for people watching.

Amy was our server. She was very friendly and took really good care of us.

Before we left, we checked out the rest of the bar and it's huge! The main floor is kind of trendy, the second floor is more like a pub and the third floor will be rented out for events. There are two patios in the back (on the ground level and second level). If you are hungry, they serve food."}
{"text":"My reviews for restaurants will be short and sweet, since all my typing time here is spent on festival coverage...

This place, this place is terrible. The girls were swamped, but very nice. They're not the problem. Whoever is in that kitchen is the problem. My burger and fries might as well have been chewy cardboard.

The end."}
{"text":"My new found love, Karaoke! I went on a mission to conquer my stage fright. The Office Pub was the best cure! So easy to make new friends too as the crowd is very positive and welcoming!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 
Firstly, why would you name your bar a name that reminds you of work, of all things? But you know what? It kind of works I guess. At least there's no kitchy office decor as I imagined. 

VIBE
Great location. I was here for a party for Social Media Week so I can't accurately comment on the people imbibing here.  
3 floors. Great for a party.  If there's more than 100 people, it's nice to have the two floors but the stair well is a bit hidden. 
Staff work hard. 
You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. The food looked OK. I'd rather go to Jack Astors after. 

I DRANK
The usual. Heinken and GT. I don't get anything fancy at pubs. They make a good GT. I think I needed three more. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
No Dwights here. But if you're looking for an after work spot that's not pretentious, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Came here for karaoke on Thursday night. It starts at 930. The DJ sings the first song ( which I thought was kind of gratuitous). The bar tenders are nice. I got the Office burger which is really juice and comes with lots of fries. Would go back for it. Especially considering that it was only 8.99."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 9 PM. At first there weren't as many people but as the night went on there were more and more people. Had a plate of nachos and honey garlic wings. Wings were not bad had a lot of sauce and nachos were just like any traditional nachos. If you lie watching live sports there is a sufficient amount of TV all around the restaurant. I am just not used to eating in very dark environments so if you enjoy eating in dark environments this is the place for you :)"}
{"text":"Had food delivered through Order It a few times, selection is plenty but some food is not great for delivery, such as poutine and chicken wings.  The chicken wings I had were a bit burnt and tough to eat. Sri Lankan Chicken Thali (basamati rice, eggplant chutney, potato curry, garlic rotti, cucumber tomato raita) tasted good, though the rotti was a little soggy.  The chicken was really spicy, the cucumber tomato raita was a good side to balance out the spiciness.  Overpriced for delivery, $4 for a can of pop is ridiculous, and every dish costs more than dine-in menu.  I also think the food would taste best for dine-in."}
{"text":"Came here to finish off a night. Happily they were open late. We just had drinks and they were good. Servers were friendly and service was quick. Didn't love the smell of it but I guess that is the charm of pubs? It won't become a favourite place but I'd come back."}
{"text":"This has probably been shared but it's worth repeating that they have a $7 daily lunch special!!!! Who the heck downtown charges only $7 for a decent burger and fries?? Usually it's a burger and fries / salad or a few wraps on the lunch special menu but a great option for the cost conscious.  

That said they charge for any changes or for any add ons.  They even charge $0.50 for a side of mayo. But don't get mad at your server for this - it's not her rule. And really the extra .50 or $1.00 is still worth it.

Oh and usually craft beer or pints are on sale certain days for $5.50.  

Great for a group of people as they usually are not really busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Very busy patio. There are more tables than the capacity of the patio and you should constantly be careful not to hit or get hit by the person sitting next to your table, or the waitress. The beers are so so and the flatbread pizza is very tiny. The inside bar is almost empty. They rushed us for our bill, when I was not even done with my drink! Not coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a great pub. Good for drinks. I came here for a late dinner with friends and ordered the chicken penne. The food was pretty bland, no seasoning and parsley all over the plate. The second level has a karaoke bar which seemed to be pretty popular with the more intoxicated crowd. I came here in the winter. The atmosphere is good and they keep the whole pub at t-shirt temperatures. Overall this place is nice, but the food needs improvement. Pass the salt please."}
{"text":"The sriracha chicken nachos were BLESSED. The sauces and seasoning was so flavorful. A little salty but hey this isn't a salad. The accompanying guac on the side is blended (gross) and nothing special but you honestly don't even need it or the sour cream/salsa. The chicken is fried seasoned in a sweet sriracha sauce and there was so much cheese. It's big enough for 3 people to share. 100% would order again - recommend it! 

However, hate that the lighting is super dim in here and I literally had to hold the candle against the menu to read it. 

Can't speak for the service much since we didn't really need anything during our meal. Food and drinks came quick though."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a quick drink and was very pleased. Moderately priced, but the servers were fantastic and tremendously quick which I appreciated. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Meh...

I went with my friend on my trip to Canada.

I ordered the wings Korean BBQ flavor (which were good) which came with fries(not so good), and she ordered the \"Ultimate office burger\"  which has provolone cheese, sautéed mushrooms, bacon, bbq sauce and a fried egg on top.. the burger I thought was fine but its not the taste you go for when you order a burger. It tasted like mashed up Salisbury steak and she didn't like it at all. 

I know you guys reading this don't know her but home girl can take down a burger, and she didn't finish it.. She definitely didn't enjoy it.

The drinks specials are good and that's what you come here for, I also like sitting outside and they have a patio which we sat on (although veeery tight) so that was nice. The one thing that turned me off a bit was our waitress just didn't listen to us very well.. I asked for a side salad and she brought me the full size salad even though I clarified I wanted a side and had already ordered wings for myself...

The salad was good don't get me wrong, just not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"If you want the best Kothu roti in town, order from here! I'm obsessed with this dish from the particular location."}
{"text":"The Fish and Chips were good. Coslaw should he sweet or savoury, not onion. He wanted regular tartar sauce but the spicy wasn't bad for being adventurous. The Seafood Linguini was AMAZING! Creamy consistency without overdoing it; instead there's more calamari than you think. Standard five shrimp but flavourful and large chunks of salmon topped it off; 10 out of 5 because that sauce binded everything to a complete delight for me. I wouldn't consider Red Lobster for pasta EVER AGAIN based on this dish alone. The portion  was just right for both menu and $4 side caesar salads ($5 Caesar Drinks) Great beer selection, most under $7 for a decent pint. $65 with tip altogether with $10 off. Only complaint is tight seating by the TVs  on main level by the bar."}
{"text":"If you have a really large group and you are in the area - this is likely a good choice.  There is always space and the outdoor patio isn't that bad.  I can't imagine coming here with less than a large group as it generally feels empty in the absence of this.

That said, the food is incredibly reasonable and the quality not bad for a pub.  The fish tacos, as an example, come with three and are huge - all for $11.  So if you need space, want something very reasonable in terms of price and don't mind a bland, quiet atmosphere; you've got your spot."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Ordered an appetizer, found out it wasn't available 15 minutes later.  Burger was way over done and had no fixings.  Just cheese, jalapenos, and very little aioli sauce.  Salad was fine.  Took me about 40 minutes to get my meal at 12:40pm, not exactly what I expected out of an office \"themed\" pub.  

Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my friends and I were looking for a place where we can dance and sing!! Thank Yelp we found THE OFFICE PUB!! But mind you, like all parties, it's not the venue per se but the crowd that makes it fun! You can be sure we brought the FUN to this place, alright!!!

Music
- a good mix of new and old (but mostly classic hits of course!!)
- DJ was good at findind the songs that we requested but we didnt get to go thru them all since the place shuts down at 2AM (so early) =P

Booze:
- Not bad, but I ordered ceasars all night so... wouldnt know about the rest =P

Service: 
- Charlotte our waitress was nice and man SHE CAN SING!! 

Location:
- right smack in the entertainment district. AWESOME!!

Layout:
- it's unfortunate that the layout of this venue kinda sucks!! there is a brick wall right in the middle of the bar. we couldnt see the stage or the people that were singing. eventually when there was less people, we moved over to the other side of the wall and partied the rest of the night!!!

Good place to be for a chill yet fun filled night laughing, singing and dancing along!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came for a networking event that was held upstairs. The space was too small and no ventilation making it very stuffy"}
{"text":"You don't go here for exceptional food. The food is pretty mediocre, but the drinks would be a reason to go here. Large cocktail list but daily drink specials that are actually worth it. Service is painfully slow but that's nothing new if downtown bars in the core. Our server seemed angry at the world which was kind of a buzzkill. The ambiance is just like any normal pub so nothing special to write about there."}
{"text":"3.5

I took my friend here for birthday dinner/drinks last night.

I don't know why this place is rated so poorly! We were there during a not so busy hour. Service was great! Our waitress was very kind, patient and attentive. My friend asked her what was on tap and she sounded like an encyclopedia listing all the beers, I even applauded her after she finished!

I started off with a caesar and asked her for it not to be too spicy and guess what? For once, it wasn't! That's definitely a point in my books!

To eat I got the fish wrap. it was pretty good! Fried fish, avocado, some kind of salsa, etc etc. Good portion and generous amount of fish. I got it with a house salad which was...a house salad lol

Overall a good experience, my friend got the chicken brie wrap and said she really like it. 

I was kicking myself afterwards for not using the $10 off deal! I didn't notice it while we were there. Oh well, an excuse to go back I suppose! I hear their poutines are something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Monday night. It was empty and we were seated right away. I ordered the nachos and he ordered a burger. The food was decent but the service was poor. Our waitress was not attentive at all, we had to go to the bar (where she was chatting with the bartender) to ask for drink refills...twice! I wouldn't come back here, BUT we did get $10 off of our meal with a yelp check in."}
