{"text":"ordered 2 phillys with double meat either they forgot or their phillys have the least amount of meat I've ever seen. Either way $20+ for 2 sandwiches with very little meat even if ordered double.. I'll pass ..sucks too cause would be decent if the cheesesteak actually had steak...shoulda took a pic it was an embarrassingly empty roll."}
{"text":"Cheese fries, onion rings, gyro, cheesesteaks all a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Omg!! The cheesesteak was simply awesome as I know this since I am a Philadelphia native for majority of my life it is the real deal ,no wonder it takes a while for my order cause they are so busy with take out and delivery all the time when I go! I notice they used real fresh mushrooms on steaks and there pizza , I must say this is Mesa's one hidden gem as it might seem like while the wall but with kick ass Qualityand taste. Please stay around this time Rocco!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service tried to use a local flavor voucher and was told that I had to have it printed out in order for them to except. Nothing on the voucher says it needs to be printed out in order to be redeemed.I guess they are not fans of having a cleaner environment. But the inside of their restaurant smells like it needs a cleaner environment!"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in Mesa. Pizza is good too. I eat here often."}
{"text":"Just found Rocco's  I'm a philly boy and this guy does it right, great fresh chewy soft roll, good meat well cooked perfect fried onions , just as fresh when u get it home. If u want a real philly cheese steak this is it. AWESOME ! I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Chose this place based off fellow reviews on here and I must say, I am extremely disappointed. Order was placed at 12:07. At 12:14 I received an email stating my order was confirmed and food was being made and would be ready in 15-30 mins. Arrived here at 1235 knowing it would probably still be a couple more mins (no big deal). I was greeted with \"are you picking up? We haven't started your order, also, can we substitute your sweet potato fries for regular?\" From the time the order was confirmed and my drive time over here the order should've already been started and practically completed, but things happen and it wasn't. She told me that it would be about 15-20 mins and she will let us know when it's ready. It's now 1250 and nothing. I finally had to ask how much longer, and was told it's going to be additional 15-20 on top of when my order was placed and what I have already waited etc because they didn't have any regular fries. This entire process pretty much consumed my entire lunch break and the 15 mins I drove to get here was a complete waste. I would expect something like this to occur when an establishment is busy during lunch but there were only 2 tables occupied and they were finished eating I was kinda concerned. And then!!! They have the audacity to call the # I put down and file a complaint about me when I asked how much longer and explained that I have to be back by 1 for an appointment. They said that online orders take 45 mins. Then why does your email say 15-30?!?!?! This place is an absolute joke, and I will be sure to spread the bad news about them everywhere!"}
{"text":"Steak sandwich is pretty good. Unfortunately the restaurant is kind of a dump. Smells like sewer backing up? Staff looks tired and angry. This place needs help."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! my old buddy and his friend, and I just tried this place for the first time tonight and, according to them, this is gonna be the new spot!  I agree :)  The cheesesteaks were large enough for old buddy and I to share one along with an 8-piece order of Jim Dandy (?) wings -- which were some of the biggest, meatiest, TASTIEST wings we've all ever had.  I got so full but had to have just one more bite, it was that good.  Mind you, for 6.99, you'll end up with a 12\" authentic-tasting submarine sandwich on the most delicious, freshest bread I've had in a long, long time...holy smokes, bro, I kinda want another!!!! :D  Can't wait until next time!   WHY DID YOU CLOSE ROCCO'S NOOOOO"}
{"text":"Right when I walked through the door the owner Rocco made me feel like family.! Amazing service. Seems like they really do care about their customers && the Food is amazing. Def one of the best cheesesteaks I've had! Def recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Recently heard about Rocco's, and as usual, was very interested in trying as I love to discover new restaurants. Tried them at lunch for the Phillie Cheese Steak. It was just ok. The meat was decent; roll was good although somewhat crusty. I've had better. Rocco was bragging that they had the \"best pizza in Arizona\" so we decided to give it a try. Sorry Rocco. You're not going to make it. The pizza was terrible...but I digress. Ordered a pizza with double cheese, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and black olives, no peppers.  Didn't get double cheese, but did get peppers (c'mon!), pepperoni pizza that looked NOTHING like the pizza, like Rocco said it would, and and two orders of chicken wings, hot.  Ok, let's go back now. Pizza was terrible!  Wings (menu says 8 pcs; I only got six in each and a chunk of something unidentifiable) were also really bad. Got Ranch dip; no carrots or celery, which really didn't matter because their purpose is to bring down the heat of the sauce, but there wasn't any heat, so...  I have a bad feeling for the future of Original Rocco's."}
{"text":"Great cheesateaks. Got the #1 with peppers and onions and it was gone before you knew it. Quick and friendly service. If you're in the neighborhood definately do not pass this place up. Will be returning again :)"}
{"text":"These people have no business being in business. We went in to order and stood at the counter for 10 min before a gentleman even acknowledged us. When he did he was rude and said it would be 20 minutes before we would get our food! We hadn't even orderd yet. Never been treated so rudely! We walked out."}
{"text":"We LOVE cheese steaks! Scouring the Valley for the next best sandwich. Probably an ill advised use of free time but it makes us happy. Well we discovered Roccos last weekend after a last ditch attempt to get takeout before 10am in Gilbert because you know everything seems to close in this town once the kids go to bed. Anyhoo Roccos was legit. Authentic bread which had to be made at a local bakery and a perfect blend of Midwestern meat and fresh veggies. We will be back very soon Rocco."}
{"text":"Yup, Rocco Has Left the Building!  I checked in and we walked out without even finishing my order . . .  Today a rude, condescending employee seemed bothered that we walked in, no greeting, no smile, no personality.  It was 3 hours before closing, late afternoon, and the place was dead - he seemed to not be familiar with what a #1 and #3 was, because he kept looking up at the menu board while he was trying to write down the order.  I requested an additional item on my sandwich and he just started shaking his head in disgust, then he felt the need to explain to me \"How the menu works.\"  I have been here several times before, but I thought perhaps the preparation has changed (no, the way they make the food hasn't, but the attitude has).  Looking at my dining companions in disbelief, I could tell that it was just futile to even acquiesce to his ignorance, saying it was an either/or proposition on preparation of the sandwich, therefore, \"Look, it is this or that - it doesn't work that way\" (apparently additions, extras or special requests are no longer honored here - so please disregard the photos I have posted).     We drove out of our way because I was groovin' for a cheesesteak and a pizza and wings was also on the list, so this is usually the place to fill both needs in one stop - but, alas, no more.  The attitude was such a turn off that I did what I rarely do - walked out . . .   Rocco, you said to tell you if ever things are not up to par; service and attitude have been declining for a while now, the food has suffered, and I, like some others recently are just done coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely terrific. Only authentic cheesesteak youre gunna get around az. Personally i have no problem with the service, coming from a guy from the northeast. They offer the menu to customers online and through their loyalty app, so its easy to know what to order before I come in. All around good eats and great prices (genos in philly costs 10.99 for exact same sandwich). Recommend to friends/family."}
{"text":"Best philly ive had in AZ and there pizza is amazing to! Definitly gotta stop here if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Az for over 20 years. I have tried Philly Cheesesteaks all over. This is by far the BEST! I also had the pizza. It was beyond fabulous ! I drove 1/2 hour to get here and will DEFINETLY be back and become a regular . People were friendly and helpful. A must go to place."}
{"text":"It was dark with no air conditioning in August in Mesa AZ! They only took cash and if you don't have it they tell you to get cash back from the neighboring gas station. Even though they are on the menu I was told they didn't sell Gyros in the summer because it was too slow and it was a waste of their time!?! I said I was a 1st timer and they weren't even welcoming. I tried to order a hoagie and was told they were out of meat! They were rude about me using a mobile coupon and I had to ask twice for him to give me my change back as though he felt entitled to keep it...My bill was close to $20 for 2 sandwiches and 1 can of soda that took over 20 minutes to make and I was the only customer! Oh and lastly no receipt that's because they don't want you to notice the mandatory 18% tip he sneaks on without permission :-("}
{"text":"My Philly was huge and juicey but could have used a little more flavor in the meat, possibly a steak sauce or two would be a nice addition as well. Pretty good for a hole in the wall! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Rocco's to try it out. At around 5:30 on Saturday there was only one other customer. We ordered a cheesesteak, a Rocco's burger,and a pizza with pepperoni,mushrooms,and peppers. They were out of mushrooms which made me wonder what we had gotten into.  Prices are very reasonable but not if the food is not good. The food turned out to be very good. I'm an east coast guy and it was the best east coast food I've had in a long time. There were three guys working and throughout our stay each of them checked to make sure we liked our food. You could tell they were proud of their food. Don't let the lack of customers or ambiance fool you. The food is good. Looks like most of their business is to go."}
{"text":"This place has the best Philly cheesesteaks in the Phoenix area. The owners are awesome and the French fries are large and crinkly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered on their website for delivery, the confirmation email stated the delivery time would be 30-45 minutes. After an hour I called them to  check the status of my delivery and all they did was yell at me and hang up before I was finished talking to them. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'd also like to mention this was my first time ordering from them. I guess don't order from their website and don't call them asking about your food because they're dicks."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We moved in pretty close to here and this was the first place we ate. Now it's our go to spot! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu- everything is always cooked perfectly. We are obsessed!"}
{"text":"Disclosure- My boyfriend is a native of the Philly area and therefore is a complete cheesesteak fanatic and snob and considers the issue so important to the world that he helped me write this review. When we go back to his home we always have several cheesesteaks because it is impossible to get an actual cheesesteak that tastes the way it \"should\" outside of the philly/south jersey area.  Until now.   Key cheesesteak components-  1.  Super chewy, almost rubbery roll that you almost have to \"fight with\" a little bit- think of the almost rubbery consistency of a true New York bagel and you kind of get the idea. This is the most obvious and heartbreaking places where most places fail. Like the importance of rice in fine sushi, the roll in a cheesesteak is almost the most important component. Rocco's nailed it.  When I commented to the guy behind the counter how they were right on with roll and how important that is he told me they baked the rolls fresh everyday. Well done sir.  Well done.   2. Real steak cut thin - we watched as the cook put pieces of ACTUAL thin slices of ACTUAL steak on the grill. Just like plastic wrapped cookies at a convenience store counter will never taste like Mom's fresh out of the oven cookies; the cheap, meat-like substances every other non-Philly based restaurant I have ever gone to has used will never create an even passable Philly cheesesteak.   3.  Philly attitude- the same way you can taste grandma's love in her thanksgiving stuffing, you can taste the attitude in a Philly cheesesteak. A good cheesesteak cook attacks the meat on the skillet with an attitude letting the meat know it's their bitch, and it WILL taste good- or else. You can actually hear if a cheesesteak is good. It sometimes sounds like a knife fight in a back room poker game at a Tokyo whorehouse (disclaimer:  I have never actually been to such a fight).  Walk into the store and yell \"Yo!  What's up\" and you will get a \"Yo! What's up buddy?\"  back.  Real deal attitude.  Real deal steak.  Five Stars!"}
{"text":"I \"cannoli\" say this place is good. It's \"sandwiched\" betweeen Mesa and Gilbert so the location is convenient. The cheesesteak is more than \"meats\" the eye but the employees really love to talk a lot so if you like good food go \"steak\" your claim. I \"parm\"arily go for the mozarella sticks. It's great as long as you don't mind the \"cheesy\" decor."}
{"text":"Really I guess I should try the cheese steak next time because they get good reviews for it.today I tried the hamburger and pizza and was really disappointed. The burger was salty and I mean salty I could only Get one bite down before moving to the cheese pizza in the hopes that it wouldn't have been a total waste .well I was wrong ! Switch what I wrote about the burger completely bland flavorless and lifeless almost like they used rago from the store as a sauce."}
{"text":"The food is really good. But that is all. The service is slow, delivery can take up to two hours (especially through grub hub). I tried to call the store but couldn't get an answer. So I was forced to use grub hub.. Cuz the phillies really are that good. This place just needs to learn how to better manage themselves. I stopped in about 3 weeks ago and they had run out of bread.. Yeah.. Bread."}
{"text":"Super good subs, they taste really fresh! It really phillies you up! I'm definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I can't believe it! NO ONE commented on the filthy place? Rude is one thing, but filth is a whole other thing.  So far, (knock on wood) no sign of poisoning but this is a nasty ass place to eat.  The bathrooms are disgustingly filthy. (The front door filth should have been the first clue but I looked past it for whatever reason that I can't explain to myself now). We took our unfinished food to go and the baskets were disgusting and apparently not washed recently.  When we removed the paper, gross crap was stuck on the baskets.. Yuck!!    The meat is pressed, kind of like Arby meat.  I always complain if a sandwich has any bite without meat and each end had no meat.  Really??? Who wants to eat just bread for your last bite?  Ordered chicken wings and according to the menu it comes with 8 wings, but we got 6 wings not the 8 as the menu stated.  The wings would have been good if they cooked them crispy but the chewy fat skin is not how I like my wings, but they were better than the Philly sandwich.  The onion rings were OK too. They were crispy and a large portion and better than the sandwich.   I can't recommend the place.  I have eaten in some hole in the wall places that probably aren't that clean but the taste of the food is worth the risk but in my opinion, not here."}
{"text":"The staff is helpful and very pleasant.  But I don't think either of them have ever been in the restaurant business.  I saw that the original owner was back at the restaurant so wanted to see if it was any better...no.  My cold sub (I refuse to call it a hoagie) was supposed to come with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes...I saw the cook take lettuce out of a bag and then she started cutting an onion.  I guess cutting a tomato was too much trouble cuz none made it on the sandwhich.  My girlfriend's cheese steak...well, she first asked if they made it in a microwave.  I told her it had to be something like that since it should not take 20 mins to make two sandwiches (I worked in a number of hoagie and cheese steak joints).  Her next comment was...next time can you have them put some cheesesteak with the onions.  Lol.  I wish them well cuz they seem like nice folks but they need help."}
{"text":"Don't eat the gyro unless u want ALOT of sour cream in it. Their Italian sandwich is not bad. Mozzarella sticks tasted frozen. Tried to eat there but employee was the only one working so said we had to take it to go. Bad first impression."}
{"text":"Nasty people! Very rude and unprofessional. We ordered online and it confirmed and said it would be 20 min. We arrived after 20 min and It was not ready and it had not been started. We waited over 40 min for our order! The best part was that when we asked about our food, we got attitude from the woman at the counter.  And the kicker.... When my daughter left a bad review, Rocco used the number she had left to call her work and file a complaint against her!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get to try their food because the employees were extremely rude and disrespectful when I was trying to place my order. Rushing me off the phone because I was asking questions they said and I quote \" we have another call coming in call us back when you figure out what you want\" extremely rude. And when I told him how rude it was the man hung up on me. I would never eat here manager was no help either."}
