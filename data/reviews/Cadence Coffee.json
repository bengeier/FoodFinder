{"text":"It's one of the better breakfast places in Calgary. The food and service is good at this simple, built on a budget restaurant. Portions are filling, coffee is good.

The only negative is that it needs sound dampening. With just a few tables the place gets loud enough to make conversation difficult as everyone seems to be shouting over the music. The loudness diminishes the experience in an otherwise great breakfast joint. 

They love cyclists."}
{"text":"Excellent coffees, baked goods, and breakfasts. At first glance, the breakfasts may appear pricey, but the portions are huge. I'm content to share.  Haven't tried lunch here.
Love the diner ambiance with the mismatched classic '50s chrome and more modern stools and tables.
Oh, and I have no affiliation with the spot, except because my last name is Cadence, people sometimes think of the spot when we're deciding where to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great coffee!  Haven't tried anything else there yet.  May adjust the review once I've had some of their food."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe/diner in bowness! The food is great, a bit on the expensive side (but I ordered french toast and got three huge slices, so the price was justified).   It's really casual and I enjoyed it a lot so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cadence is a cafe that marches to its own beat.  
This little fixture in Bowness is best described as a coffee shop with a distinct diner flare.  From the red walls and metal accents to the checkered floors and the retro diner stools at the counter, Cadence is a funky little joint to come for breakfast, lunch, or just a coffee.
I walked in on a Saturday morning and the place was hopping, but I didn't have to wait long to place my order at the counter for an Americano and date square to go.  
While waiting, I had a chance to peruse the menu on the chalkboard, and observe many happy noshers clearly pleased with their orders.  My Americano was seriously one of the best I've had in Calgary, and the date square was just right as an accompaniment.
I'm definitely going to revisit this cool neighbourhood hangout for a meal next time.
This place is cool beans, man."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly. The breakfast is good, albeit a bit pricy, but if you aren't too hungry, it's big enough to share breakfast. They have a good espresso machine and make a decent latte. The only concern, and the lower review, is the high turnover of excellent staff, unusual in a community diner during a weaker economy."}
{"text":"We have lived in Bowness for over a year and honestly drove by this place so many times.  Little did we know until today what a treasure it is!   The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was so reminiscent of my native Vancouver in earlier years.  
We both ordered Huevos Rancheros which were amazing!  Sorry, we forgot to take a photo because we were so busy just taking it all in.   My partner is Mexican and although this is not how Huevos Rancheros are made in Mexico, he also said these were fabulous!  Unlike another reviewer who reported them to be cold and dried out, these were hot, fresh and absolutely delicious.
We love our coffee and it's rare to have us say that the coffee was good ~ It was!!  
All in all, this is our new haunt for late breakfast or brunch and, we can't wait to try the burgers and other fare.
By the way, we arrived at 11:45 so it was super busy and still everything arrived quickly! 
We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in Bowness. Food is good and coffee is great! sometimes there can be long lines which is a bit of a drawback."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!  Food is always super yummy and satisfying.  The decor is cute 50's diner reminiscent.  Coffee here is soooo good!  Can't say anything bad about this gem."}
{"text":"Great café in Bowness.  Coffee and a breakfast bagle are my go to there. Service can be a little slow at times but the end result is worth the wait.  Try Cadence, their retro décor and atmosphere and especially the fact they remember the names of their regulars is great.  Like eating in my moms kitchen!"}
{"text":"Really like this locally-owned cafe in Bowness. The retro 50's style decor is inviting and the place is always clean.

The menu is classic diner style. The staff are friendly and service is pretty quick.

It's pretty solid quality on the food side of things and I like that it is consistently good quality.

It gets pretty busy on the weekends, which is a sign of well-liked it is. It's a great place to go in the off-peak times.

This is a great little local diner that I am happy to support."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now, and I'm torn about this one. It has a great atmosphere, the menu has a lot of things I enjoy, and the food has always been good. But there's always a few things that leave me wanting just a little bit more. Many of the sandwiches come with under-seasoned and undercooked hashbrowns. And today the toast in my club sandwich came out cold and way too crunchy. It basically shredded the roof my mouth to pieces, and I felt like i was eating a grenade of razor blades. But the ingredients were so fresh and the sandwich so well constructed that I still enjoyed it. 

It's so close to being a great place. I think the employees need to just care a little more (they kind of act like they're too cool to be there), and they'll have a home run."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch hour break with 2 colleagues. Cadence is a reliable resto with good food, but I have not been in years. Two of us ordered a traditional breakfast with eggs, potatoes and sausage and one of us had the burger. 

The sausage was a little sweet and boring and the potatoes were not really browned so they lacked some crispiness I was expecting. Overall the food was good, but I'd like to see them kick it up with an exceptional meat and crispy spuds.

It was a warm day and it was HOT inside the resto. They could have had a few fans to move the air around. The resto has a vintage coffee house feel, but also feels a bit grubby and worn. 

The staff at the counter were not terribly interested in anything but their own conversation. I hate it when I feel like I'm putting them out because I'm placing my order.

{"text":"Love the little community of Bowness (Bow Ness?) as it really seems like it's own little town apart from the chaos of Calgary. This \"diner\" contains the same charm, but I feel it's a little overpriced for what you get (talking chow, not joe). Had my standard sweetened latte which was yumyumgood but the brunch was just ok. We were slightly amazed that we had paid $30 for coffee and brunch for 2 at a \"diner\" (ok ok, coffeeshop) and were not blown away by the food.

I would reccomend Cadence for java and treats, as the cookies looked ginormous and the coffee is yummy. The atmosphere is very low-key and we saw the after-church crowd, hipsters and girls-brunch-out. Counter service also kind of takes away from the premium prices, as it's more deli-style with table-servce pricing. 

All in, somewhere I would go again, just not for food. Neighborhood is kick ass though, and I'm betting I'll stop in again for a latte while the boyf spends an hour or so in the bike store next door!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Bowness so I could come here more often!  

The space is bright and funky - like a burst of sunshine.  While it is reminiscent of a diner, the coffee here is miles above the quality I normally find at a diner.  It is first and foremost a coffee shop.

There are fresh baked goods made every morning in their ovens, but if you want something more substantial there are plenty of options.  I had the breakfast bagel and was asked my preference of bagel, cheese, and toppings.  There was the standard toasted bagel (and not the giant kind, the normal size!), tomato, cheese, etc but the addition of alfalfa sprouts kept it fresh and light.

Overall?  If you have flexibility with your locations for coffee/breakfast meetings make the effort to meet someone there.  They'll have a full stomach and a great mood to match!"}
{"text":"Cadence is only a short walk from my place, so its an easy place for me to go for a cup a joe.  The place is quite busy around breakfast and lunch.  My favorite thing at Cadence is their peanut butter marshmallow squares or should I say brick!  This thing is huge, but for $4 it should be!  Their prices for coffees are reasonable in my eyes.  They have other fresh muffins, squares, etc.  Their breakfast is good, a decent size.  The bacon is organic and very tasty!  Its definitely not a cheap place to go for breaky, but it is good and fresh!  Don't come here if you want to be waited on.

 This is a place you come to have a coffee and chat with a friend or grab breakfast on a weekend morning.  It is a must try if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced but delicious. $26.85 for an omlette, egg-witch, and one coffee.

The breakfast menu isn't really anything unique. Various types of eggs, egg-wiches, meat, and veg options. The eggs were good (but not as good as farm fresh), the bread was fresh, but in proportion to cost and inspiration of the menu, this place ain't much. Considering this places costs double a breakfast at a cheap diner in Toronto's Queen West (where real estate is double) yet only slightly better, I'm not going to give this place more than 2 stars.

Service is pretty weak. It's self service yet they have a tip jar at the cashier and the debit machine asks if the payer would like to tip. I really dislike that sense of entitlement. They aren't rude, and I don't demand some bubbly idiot in a short skirt to ask me how my day is going, but, despite staffers hanging out behind the bar we were sitting at, they never said obligatory customer service remarks such as: \"thanks\", \"may i bring you anything\", \"may i refill your coffee\", and \"how was this meal?\". I even asked one for tobasco and she pointed at the condiment table at the other end.

This place has the potential to give something unique but they just keep it simple for the lowest common denominator. I'm worried that our city is turning into vancouver."}
{"text":"Fresh, clean and friendly. I just had an avocado blt with mushroom soup & it was delightful. Grabbed a must i to go and it was perfectly made and good coffee."}
{"text":"I like diners and they're few and far in between in Calgary nowadays.

This place is set up cafeteria style - order (eggs benny!), pay, grab a number and (hopefully) find a table.

I don't think there's ever been a time here where it it's not busy. And there's no reason it shouldn't be - food's decent (the hashbrowns could be more crisp), service is efficient and it's clean."}
{"text":"Cadence moves at a good pace. Service is friendly and quick. They have daily specials which I'll come back to check out - but this time I stuck with the classic breakfast. Standard fare, but eggs were a bit undercooked - I'd order one hardness level more next time. 

Inside the dining area is spacious for a breakfast place and the background music isnt overwhelming for conversation. The tables -of which there are 9 - had reasonable turnover, and there is more than enough counter seating if in a group of two or solo. Many people ordered breakfast to go and they didn't wait long before they could be on their way. 

Coffee here is very good - even just a standard cup of joe was great. If i lived in Bowness I'd come back just for that. 

Overall I would recommend this for a decent standard breakfast place and will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"While waiting for my new bike to be ready at Bow Cycle, I popped in here for a tea and a bit of a snack. This diner is adorable! I love the retro tables and I also liked that there are tons of places to sit. I had an earl gray tea and tried a slab of carrot cake. The tea was fine, nothing special but the carrot cake was spot on! The cream cheese icing was declicious - not to sweet and just cream cheesy enough. I hate dry carrot cake and this was far from dry! So moist! Plus, they were not skimpy on the serving size, this big slab was perfect for sharing. I would like to come back again. 

Also, they close at 4 on Saturday afternoon (not sure of the rest of the hours) - found out the hard way when we got the boot!"}
{"text":"It's my local so I have an ongoing relationship.  When I first moved into Bowness (from Vancouver) I thought it was amazing.  Food quality, coffee and ambiance were great.  Now that I have sampled more of Calgary I think it may be slightly overpriced food wise.  It's less than Vancouver but hello?  This is Bowness, no need to be priced so high.  I think they get away with it because it is the only cool coffee place in the area.  Still great coffee and amazing place to hang out during the day...or have a meeting but unless I am dying of hunger I pass on the food.

Ask the counter staff for the wifi password - it's now free!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met up at Cadence Coffee for breakfast a couple of mornings ago. From the moment we walked in, I wasn't sure if Cadence was a coffee shop or a diner. I later found out that it's both! They brew a variety of coffees, serve speciality caffeine beverages, offer delicious baked goods, and they ALSO offer sandwiches, salads, soups, breakfasts, etc!

The coffee was delicious and I was really feelin' the vibe. I could have sat there and people-watched for hours! The staff is very friendly and lucky for us, it wasn't painfully busy the morning that we were there.

The prices are higher than you'd pay at just a regular coffee shop, but I thought we already established that Cadence is far from *regular*, didn't we?!?!?

My only complaint is that their cinnamon buns were too plain! They were simple - no icing, no raisins, no nuts. Just a sticky bun. Surprisingly plain for a place like Cadence!"}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast/brunch and it was great.

I had an omelet and my friend the traditional type of breakfast(eggs,toast,bacon etc) and both looked and tasted great. The coffee was so good and they were kind enough to give me a \"to go\" cup to enjoy when I was leaving.

Prices are average and portions are as well.

The place is busy on a Sunday morning but was worth waiting! Will go again and also try to go for lunch too. A great place in Bowness."}
{"text":"Great little cafe/diner in Bowness. 

Decor is retro, and the whole cafe was very spacious. Service is a bit weak, but food is excellent! I had the tandoori lamb burger - YUM! Seriously tasty. My side salad had avocados and sunflower seeds and almonds in it. Double yum.

I hardly ever venture out to Bowness, but I may have to more often now, just for Cadence!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here this morning. I had the \"Traditional Breakfast\" with sausage, poached eggs, hashbrowns & rye toast.  Everything was fresh and properly prepared. The coffee was good, better than Dennys, Ricky's or Humptys. 
The decor is 50's diner style but with vibrant art on the walls. Music was not too loud. The place was busy but not packed.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I quite liked this little cafe for breakfast.We went at 10am on a Sunday and it was busy but not too busy that we had to wait to long.  The cafe itself almost looks 50 and the decor is very cool. Apon entering the cafe you order your breakfast, coffees ect at the till and then you are given a number and you can go find any table you want and they will deliver your food out to you (drinks you have to pick up at the counter). The food was fairly good as well - no complaints. I ordered the benny and asked for my eggs poached hard and they came out that way which was a bonus (alot of the time at other places they don't when I order it) The only downside was nobody ever came up to us after getting our food to check on us - I'm not sure if this is just something they don't do or if they were too busy. Either way it was a decent experience here."}
{"text":"This is actually a 4.5...My hubs suggested this, when we both woke up hungry on Saturday morning and living close seemed like a good option. I've heard of this place before, but never been. We got there at a good time, as there was no line to order food, that quickly changed. 

It's relatively small in there, very diner style, so we chose to take ours to go and eat at home. The cashier was wonderful I asked if I could get fruit instead of toast and hashbrowns, and they swapped it free of charge. 

They were very good in their packaging to ensure that none of my food touched my husbands so I wouldn't have to ingest gluten. Breaky was good, fruit was actually fresh, not canned. Steve had two sausage minis and always raves how good they are. 

I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast a few times. Have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have tried. Once ordered yogurt with granola and fruit. It came with beautiful fresh fruit. Couldn't have asked for better. The coffee is excellent, too."}
{"text":"My review is for catering. We ordered trays of sandwiches, an assortment of ham/beef/chicken and vegetarian. Holy smokes, Cadence makes one of the best vegetarian sandwiches. It was so good. Perfectly ripe pieces of avocado, sprouts, cucumber, onion, cheese and lettuce. One sandwich fills you up. The other meat sandwiches were good too, generous amount of meat goes into each sandwich. These are old fashion, satisfying sandwiches. Don't expect to see pesto aioli, artisan bread or fancy smancy  unicorn tears."}
{"text":"Quality coffee, incredible food, and a classic diner feel - cadence dine is an authentic part of the Bowness community. It's all about the little things. Little things like read vinyl and checkered floors."}
{"text":"I love Cadence. A long time resident of Bowness, I had been longing for a \"real\" coffee shop - one that would make something a bit more inventive than just drip coffee (read: lattes, espresso, etc.) - since I was in high school. Then along came Cadence. 

I don't stop in nearly as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's always fantastic. The coffee - both brewed and espresso-based - is rich and delicious, the food is scrumptious, the pies are HUGE and the staff are friendly and provide quick service, even during the morning rush. 

Altogether, the location, atmosphere, decor, service, food/drink and overall vibe adds something to my neighbourhood that I love. If you find yourself in downtown Bowness on a sunny afternoon - or even on a drizzly one - be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"very good coffee, but breakfasts are horrible there, avoid the huevos rancheros the refritos were dried out on the stale tortilla and eggs were cold by the time they served them.  I still pop in for coffee and a cookie from time to time, just won't do hot food there bleh!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Consistently good food. Fantastic coffee. Very good value as well. Love to meet people here for breakfast and a coffee. Saturday a.m. can be especially busy though so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cafe while looking for a local restaurant that was closed. The food was made with fresh ingredients, the home fries were homemade, and the orange juice was freshly squeezed that am. To top it off, the cafe had great ambiance. I would definitely recommend this find to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"The husband and I tried Cadence Coffee on a Saturday morning after dropping off our car at Crystal Glass across the street. We ordered a traditional breakfast of eggs, toast and ham. The coffee was decent and I always love places that serve Mighty Leaf tea, which Cadence does. Like Vendome, this place requires you to order at the counter, find a table and the staff will bring you your order. It gets really busy and we could barely find a free table since it seemed like most people went there to meet up with friends and family to chat for a long time over breakfast and a cup of coffee. I can see why Cadence is a neighborhood gem and its a good place to try if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I had never been there before. Surprisingly busy early on a Sunday. Service was quick food was better than average at a price that was tough to beat. A little far for me to go on a regular basis but if you live in the neighbourhood check it out."}
{"text":"The people at Cadence welcome us with there cheerful disposition and great espresso drinks.  The breakfast is particularly good, especially the breakfast club!"}
{"text":"Way to hot to sit inside on a hot day. Coffee & food ok but unless you want take out I wouldn't go on hot day."}
{"text":"It's Saturday, you want a coffee, you missed the breakfast cutoff at your other favourite place and you're in Bowness. Where do you go? Cadence Coffee.

Sporting a menu of all-day breakfast, some light lunch options like sandwiches, salads or wraps, as well as items \"from the grill\" like burgers and reubens, Cadence Coffee is a bit more than your usual coffee shop.

At 12:30 on a Saturday, it was packed. There was a steady stream of people in queue, and not a table to be had in sight. It seemed that as soon as one freed up, there was someone lurking nearby waiting to claim it. This was enough to convince me to get my sandwich and coffee to go.

I ordered a half sandwich and a 16 oz Americano. My oh my, the half sandwich on it's own was piled high. I wish they'd use a bit of a thicker slice of bread, it was hard to hold all of that up. I'm impressed that the to-go container is biodegradable. How do I know? Well, it's stamped clearly on the top, and unlike the new Sunchips packaging, this biodegradable container is pretty quiet. 

Service is good and fairly quick for a busy Saturday. They've got a full kitchen ready to make your meal and servers bringing you your food so you don't need to worry about hanging around the counter.

Tip: If you can, don't go Saturday at lunch, you may very well find yourself with a 5 star experience :)."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile and certainly won't go back.  The food wasn't bad but the price was shocking.  $9 for a bowl of soup and a bun?  Seriously???  I was stunned when the food was delivered to our table.  I would say we got a cup and a half of soup at most.   My friend had a sandwich for $14.  At least she didn't leave hungry like I did.   Left feeling completely ripped off.  Sorry Cadence but I am done with you once and for all."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this hidden breakfast joint! The place has a great community vibe. 

They have great coffee, and the baked goods are amazing. I often get The Breakaway.

Seating can be hard to find at peak times (because the locals know best!), so better to go early. They have a picnic table out back which is nice to eat at on sunny days. 

A simple, no fuss diner with friendly staff and good food! I always LOVE going to Cadence.

Update : my last two visits have not been as pleasant. Food has been going downhill as of late. Unsure if it is a new Chef or what but very disappointing."}
{"text":"We had driven by here so often and it's always crowded. The street appeal was not so good however, we decided that if so many people were inside, there had to be something going on. There was! The breakfast huevos rancheros is amazing! The coffee is excellent (finally a place that knows how to make coffee!), the carrot cake is delish and so much more. We've been there several times now and it will always be a cozy, funky place to go and eat.

What a great find for Bowness!"}
{"text":"Colorful, cheeful, cheap! Went there on Mother's day, looking for coffee but stayed for brunch - was surprised that they were not busy considering the day. Was even more surprised after the great brunch, superb coffee (not bitter at all) and excellent value. 

Move over Dairy Lane, this is likely to become our new weekend brunch place."}
{"text":"Cadence is probably the best coffee shop in Bowness.  It's right on Bowness Road so you can't miss it if you're in the area.  It's the perfect little diner/cafe to stop in and have a java or a sandwich.

It may be a little pricey for a coffee shop, but I think it's totally worth it.  It's just a very interesting place to sit around in for a couple of hours, read your book, or chat with some locals.  It almost seems like Cadence is a bit out of place in Bowness, but it works perfectly.

I find it odd, however, that it is only open until 4pm weeknights and 3pm on Sunday.  It would seem like they could make so much better business if they would stay open a little longer. 

I really enjoy Cadence for what it is, a cute cafe diner.  If ever I'm in dire need of coffee and am in the Bowness area, Cadence is where I go."}
{"text":"Cadence is a great little Bowness secret for great coffee and fabulous Breakfast on a Bagel (BOB)!"}
{"text":"My gentleman and I popped into Cadence for brunch the other day. As a self appointed specialist in brunch, gluten free brunch and omelettes I feel completely qualified to say that Cadence is one of my most favourite places to eat said meal.
I like the atmosphere (rad old school diner meets trendy cafe). I like the menu (great mix of breakfasts staples and favourites and DESSERTS). 
I had the omelette with all of the veggies with potatoes and fruit. They do not have GF bread but honestly I didn't miss it. The boy had the traditional breakfast no bread and we both had some delicious coffee.
The food was great, tasty and delivered quickly. The omelette had so many veggies which is exactly how I like it, and a reasonable amount of cheese.
We didn't wait (it WAS Tuesday.,.)and the cashier was super nice and helpful. All in all, great.

Pros: great service/menu, cool neighbourhood, tasty food. (The hashbrowns you guys. Omg)
Cons: no GF bread or baked goods

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better, haven't been here for a couple years.   I will not be returning. . . .

Service was ok, staff was mostly friendly and helpful.  Food was not so great. The meals that we had ordered included the hash browns, when the food arrived at the table the hash browns were luke warm at best.  We informed the staff, and they brought us a small plate of fresh hash browns right away. They were equally as cold.  None of the staff came back to see if we were satisfied. . . . 

The rest of the meal was adequate, but certainly not worth what we paid.

The Americano coffee was pretty good.

The whole place is looking pretty tired, and needs a good facelift and cleaning, and some fresh water in the mop bucket would go a long ways when cleaning the bathroom floors.

Best to spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I am reminded how much I shouldn't go. The owner doesn't seem to care about customers at all. 

Today at lunch they were playing \"thrash\" and I suggested that the crowd of 40+ ers might appreciate a different choice. They said they were supporting CJSW and they wouldn't change it. 

Food is average and everything is over-priced. Skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time....it has doubled in size and the interest in the place has kept pace. A cross between 50's diner and hipster coffee shop the atmosphere is a welcome break from chain coffee shops and breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Coffee could be better (but then I do have a more 'European' preference in that regard, so tend to find most Canadian coffee very weak), but the food is excellent and reasonably priced."}
