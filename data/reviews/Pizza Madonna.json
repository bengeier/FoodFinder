{"text":"I'm pretty indifferent about the food, but the service is just plain rude.   I ordered fries and was prepared a poutine (I'm a vegetarian so I did not and have not ever ordered poutine). When I corrected him he kept going \"you saw me put on the gravy. you saw me put on the cheese and you said nothing.\" There's no way I could have seen any of this from where I was standing which I pointed out (not that stopping him post-gravy would have saved the fries anyway) but it didn't stop him from repeating this rant about four or five times.   He then told me next time to speak louder and he would get me what I wanted. Next time. Yeah right. There are dozens of other places in the area with a similar menu and prices, and their staff is almost universally more polite."}
{"text":"Treats poutine like it should be treated: quick and dirty fast food. Molten cheese curds, thick gravy and crispy fries, it doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Pizza is OK. Poutine fries were burned badly on several occasions.  Prices are low, but not in significant competition with other pizza joints in the area.  It is an institution, and it's close to Prince Arthur street. They could, however, achieve much more and much better."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Stopping at Madonna's was a quick detour out of our food-venture during montreal's street festival on Saint-Laurent Boul.   I got the All Dressed pizza. For those that don't know, \"all dressed\" in canada is highly similar to  \"the works\" in US. To break that down, its a combination of mushrooms, green peppers, and pepperoni.   Their pizza is comparable to new york style, large slices, thinner crust. They threw on a good amount of toppings on there as well.   Open late, super cheap at $2.50 a piece.  Oh and I had this sober, super yums still."}
{"text":"J'adore Pizza Madonna à 3h du matin ou en pm. J'y ai été cette fois-ci vers minuit et pas grand choix de Pizza et la pizza n'avait pas un air frais...Quand il est 3h la pizzeria est full. Pleins de délicieuses saveurs et c'est frais et bon...(est-ce que c'est à cause de l'alcool...sûrement) Bref, ca fait bien la job quand on a faim des pointes jumbos. Je vous conseille de ne pas aller aux toilettes situés au sous-sol. Ça sent bizarre, c'est sale et on ne sait pas trop ce qui s'est passé dans ses toilettes là fréquenté par toute sorte de personne sur la rue St-Laurent....Bref, bon petit spot pour de la pizza arter club et c'est ouvert tard. Je n'ai malheureusement jamais goûter les frites et je n'y ait aucun intérêt d'ailleurs...."}
{"text":"Trash place, trash crowd and trash service. Even if this is your last drunchies option at 4 am, you better just hit they hay and call it a night. To make it worse, the staff is simply rude. The guy that served me thought he was some sort of gangster, heating up slices of pizza from behind the counter. Almost funny. There's better places close by."}
{"text":"Big slices, great prices. Best poutine I have had in Canada, in my opinion. The guy working there was super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, open after the bars closed.  But I'm certain my drunkedness has little to do with how good it tasted.  Yeah.  That's it."}
