{"text":"Best Greek food in town!!   Great people awesome clean atmosphere. Food is exquisite  I'll be coming back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! The most delicious Greek food I have ever eaten! Flavourful, authentic and well balanced dishes with great service. I didn't know what to expect when I saw that Greektown was opening up. I thought it might be a fast food joint, like Opa. Boy, was I ever wrong about that!   We ordered the hummus as suggested by the other review, and got something even better than hummus. It was clearly home made because the quality was beyond reproach. We then had the house salate (salad), which had an impressive variety of fresh vegetables with an amazing balsamic reduction. The giovatsi was legit, a clay pot affair with zucchini and a tasteful, not totally overpowering, tomato sauce over the noodles.   Where they really shined was the dessert. Like everything else, it was clearly made from scratch, or pretty close. We got the dessert trio and we were incredibly impressed by the flavors and quality. Top notch!  Give the place a try, even if you don't think you like Greek! This place is good. Really good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends last night and we were greeted with giant smiles and hugs. They have been here a few times before ;)   We decided to order a ton of appies and share so I could try everything. All of the dips were AMAZING, my favorite being the taramosalata. The saganaki was so good we ordered a second round! The meatballs were the best I've ever had, and the calamari wasn't greasy as fried things tend to be.   The mythos were ice cold and served promptly and then we decided that OF COURSE there's room for Greek coffee and dessert and shared the trio. Ehkmek is my favorite, but holy damn what is up with the yogurt!!?? Seriously. Eat the yogurt. To die for. I will definitely be back to try out dinner next time!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try Greektown (e.g. love Greek food; menu looked great on the website; great location), but came away wondering if I would go back, mostly due to odd/spotty service.    Things started out well; got a table on the fashionable patio; beautiful weather.  Waiter was super-attentive (perhaps overly so; we weren't in a hurry to order and would have appreciated less pressure).    Waiter wasn't very good at recommending things off the menu; e.g. when asked about appies to share, he only suggested the big platter (for 2 of us?!)  Had the Kritiko Boureki to start (eggplant/cheese in phyllo with honey drizzle); yummy.  Waiter offered to let me taste a wine before committing to a glass, but then just brought the whole glass (and took 20 min.)  Friend enjoyed his Moussaka.  My lamb chops were tasty but overdone.  The chops, and all the grilled meats, seem to come on a wooden board which looks nice but makes me wonder if they can sanitize them properly?  (There are many knife cuts in the board.)  Also, no tzaziki?!  Waiter could have mentioned this & tried to upsell us on pita & tzaziki, but he didn't, so I was disappointed that I ended up going without.  Greek village salad was good, but had to order separately; entrees come with grilled veg and one other side (e.g. potatoes/rice); don't recall an option to substitute salad for veg.  Potatoes were slightly dry.    After our entrees, the service all but disappeared (except for quick water fill-ups).  Waiter didn't ask us about coffee/dessert, and we eventually had to ask for the bill.  So the experience kind of fizzled.  Might give it one more try.    Note, parking is very tricky before 4th St. opens up at 6 pm; side streets are virtually all permit-parking, and the 5 Greektown spots (marked \"Istanbul\"!) along the back fence in the Mac's lot were taken by 5:30."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. I have a new favorite!! Try the bison meatballs and the seafood platter, out of this world. I visited after reading great reviews, and the are well deserved."}
{"text":"Souvlaki and potatoes are delicious. Very good service. One of the better Greek places in town."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday this past weekend. We all love Greek food and so upon hearing about Greek Town, we decided to try it out. The decor of the restaurant is quite nice and has a casual feel. I had the pork chops, and they were delicious. I loved the marinade they had on them. So good! My friends all had a different souvlaki wrap, which all earned rave reviews. We also started with the saganaki, which was awesome. I love that they served bread with it. I haven't seen that at many Greek restaurants that I've been to.  So why only 3 stars? Well, service left a lot to be desired. Our server wasn't very professional. He didn't greet us with a \"hello\", just \"what do you want?\" I know it may sound nit picky, but I've worked in the industry and it really doesn't take much to say hello to someone. He also yelled across the room at his friends while we were trying to place our order. He barely checked up on us, never once asked how everything was tasting. When the mains arrived, our 3 dishes arrived. But, my friend's dish took an extra 10 minutes to come out. I felt bad as she was the birthday girl, and she had to wait extra for her food.   So overall, I really enjoyed the food. But the service (or lack thereof) really bothered me. I feel a good restaurant has to have both great food and great service. It's hard to want to return somewhere that serves amazing food when service is lousy."}
{"text":"The food was really good! We ordered the platter and a few appetizers and overall it's one of the best Greek food restaurants I've been too.  However the service was horrendous.  They take forever to take your order and when they do they said what do you want? Then when the food arrives they never ask you how it is,  if you need anything else.  When we wanted to pay they just never came to ask us if we wanted our bill.  When we finally asked and got it,  it took half an hour for them to bill us because the waiter kept leaving everytime he swiped a card and wouldn't come back for at least 10 minutes and we had four people that needed to pay separately.  Very unprofessional. Don't know if we'll be back because the service was that bad.  There are other Greek places that are probably better in this city."}
{"text":"Hands down best greek salad I have ever had!!! Great food great service!! I will definitely be a repeat and recommend"}
{"text":"Came in during lunch last week and was sooo dissapointed. Over priced and the food wasnt that good, I could have made it. The service was awful we were the only customers and she took her time when we made it clear we were starving. She was too busy chatting with her friends. We both got salmon dinner dish for lunch and the steamed vegetables came out gross even our the lemons to out water were tiny and looked old see pic. Wont go back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Mission neighbourhood. Fantastic salads, the best calamari, and spanakopita melts in your mouth! There is a new Greek vibe in town and I like it!"}
{"text":"We just got back from Greece a week ago and were craving Greek food .....Can't get enough! Worried that nothing would even compare once we got back we thought we would try something new. We were definitely impressed! Were were optimistic when we walked in and the staff was Greek....a good sign. We had a bunch of Mezes to try a lot of things to see if it was close to authentic and I must say.....it is pretty damn close! Everything was delicious....Saganaki, calamari, tadziki, spanikopita, lamb chops, pita bread, garlic prawns. They even had a great selection of Greek wine and Mythos Beer (Our favorite greek beer!!!!) Our waitress, Katerina, was attentive and fun and really made our night great! The only thing that was kind of off was that it echos a lot and is very loud in there so prepare to speak up. But so worth it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal last night for Valentine's Day!! Wow, everything was so flavourful and delicious. Hard to pinpoint what was our favourite. I already had an idea of what we would order prior to going to the restaurant but to our surprise, Greektown was offering a set menu for the special occasion that was pretty much what we wanted to have anyway, but with free dessert at a price of $78 per couple. I also ordered a mango sangria that was good and not too sweet.   Started off with the 4 dips platter with pita bread. The signature hummus and roasted pepper dips were our favourite but all were yummy! We asked the server to leave these for our whole meal so we could eat them with everything lol. We then had the flaming saganaki cheese also with pita and so good like the first course, just wished there was more cheese...  For our main course, we had the mixed grill which came with porkchops, lamb, beef, chicken, rice, roasted potatoes and veggies. Lots of food! All were flavourful and grilled to perfection. My boyfriend doesn't even like pork but loved the porkchop the most. So flavourful and juicy! We then had the chicken and beef skewers and those were chargrilled and little pieces of heaven. We saved the lamb for last and super tender and bursting with flavour. Definitely recommend the mixed platter. This is their signature and we will return to eat it again lol.  Ended off with two chocolate mouse desserts topped with strawberries and chocolate syrup that was light and a good way to end this amazing meal. There were also little balls of what appeared to be profiteroles in the ramekins that added a good texture to the dessert.  Overall awesome experience and with great service the whole night even though they were packed. Excited to return to try some other items."}
{"text":"Firstly- the food was great, no issues there.   I did have the following problems though. This was a delivery order, I specifically stated that there was a severe dairy allergy and that no tzatziki was to be put onto one of the souvlaki. Unfortunately when the order arrived both souvlaki had a large amount of tzatziki and my friend with the dairy allergy couldn't eat his.  (I still ate mine, and it was very tasty)  My next problem was that they didn't include any cutlery or napkins. In addition to my souvlaki I had rice, delicious however difficult to eat without a fork.   Overall, due to the disregard/oversight of a severe allergy, the lack of a fork, and the very high price, I probably wont be choosing Greek Town again. There are other options available in the city."}
{"text":"Spanakopita and village salad are reallly good! Must try. We get lunch from this place for our office lunches."}
{"text":"This is a 4.5 stars.  Most Greek restaurants in the city fail to impress me. They're mostly all bland and not very original.   I visited a few months ago with my husband and a friend and I LOVED it. The atmosphere is casual, yet nice. It is right in Mission so location is perfect also.  My husband had a souvlaki, our friend had the lamb, and I tried the chicken chops. Holy moly, the chicken was SO FLAVOURFUL! I was blown away! I usually never order chicken at a restaurant because it is usually bone dry and super bland. But I was trying to restrict my red meat intake that week, so I went for the chicken and man what a great choice! It was deliciously marinated and might be a contender for one of the best chicken I had ever had.  The lamb was good too, as well as the souvlaki, but the chicken was hands down the highlight of the meal. It was all reasonably priced too. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Good food and tastes pretty healthy. Was a bit disappointed with the portions of Greek salad and potatoes. The drinks were mediocre.  However, the meat was prepared quite nicely."}
{"text":"Close to a 4 star but...prawns were previously frozen but still tasty. Service was genuine and honest. Greek salad was fresh and tasty/zesty."}
{"text":"Excellent food in the Mission District."}
{"text":"The food came really fast. The greek poutine was delicious! And the wraps were sooo good. Best greek food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Greek Town is new to this Bermuda Triangle of restaurant locations, always changing hands. I had low expectations going in, but was pleasantly surprised!   The service was lovely- the server even shook our hands when we left. He was very attentive but not too attentive- though we did have to wait a bit for the bill at the end.   The food! The food was awesome. Way better than expected. You could taste the fire in the meat, the lemon in the potatoes, everything was perfectly prepared.  The cost was a little high for someone like me, but at least we totally got what we paid for. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Greek Town Rocks!  Yamas!  We came here before a show, and it was recommended.  Beautifully clean, and amazing attentive family service!  And the food, really incredible.   It's a very open and airy restaurant with high ceilings.  We had some Mythos greek beer and also the free white wine.  Mythos if you have not had it is very light and tasty.  A mild lager.    For appetizers we did the feta and olives which came with some pita.  The goat feta was very creamy and soft.  Was just great.  Hey also have some awesome Greek EVOO on the tables and they sell it.   Use liberally! The dolmades was great too. Grape leaves stuffed with rice and with a lemon sauce.  This also came with some pita and tzatzikki, which was very well done.    Onto the salad, we went with the house special. It takes out the romain, and adds capers, artichoke hearts, endive, and balsamic. It was great. Awesome to share as it was large.    We then ended with the mixed grill, look at the photo an exceptional presentation.  It had a couple of lamb racks, which were cooked great.  It had 2 big pork chops as well which were just average. A skewer of beef and chicken, souvlaki style was my favorite.  Dip in the tzatzikki too, we went with the lemon potatoes which were also very good.   Overall great experience.  The owner shook our hand on the way out and they were all very friendly.  Definitely coking back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Food and service are great! The mixed grill is my go to. So much food for two people! All the meat and veggies were seasoned and cooked well. I've had this on several occasions paired with some Mythos greek beer. Highly recommend, it isn't that busy of a place making it a great last minute dinner spot if you give them a call ahead. The patio is great for the summer too for people watching."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great ambiance. The lamb shank was amazing. Saganaki is delicious l. With nice sour flavor. Emmet for desert was just surreal, so light and yogurtie!!!"}
{"text":"Love those place always amazing service and the food is amazing. Clean and refreshing. Makes me feel like I'm in Greece."}
{"text":"I went to Greek Town with a group for a birthday recently and the experience was fantastic. Great food, decent prices. Awesome service. Good atmosphere for a group or a private dinner. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best greek food I have had in calgary by far. I have only ordered to go from here so i cant speak to the actual service in the restaurant, but the food is a legit 5/5 from the many times i have ordered it. I usually get the beef souvlaki with rice and fries and then the tzatziki dip with extra pitas. It is always delicious and a go to when im craving greek. They seem to use high quality ingredients and typing this review is making my mouth water..if you're considering eating here, you should."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Greek town, both times were great, food taste amazing and portion is great, lots of varieties and choices. Service is as great as the food. The design is simple and romantic. My favourite spot for date night with my hubby."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Greek Town.  I love Greek and most Mediterranean food.  Our dinner was during Father's Day so it was quite busy.  My first impressions was it was pretty nicely designed dining area.  It wasn't decorated like the typical cliche Greek restaurants in town.  The food portions are huge.  I ordered the pork chops and what came out were 3 huge pork chops, roasted potatoes, 2 grilled tomato halves and some arugula.  I could only finish 2 pork chops and saved the rest for lunch.  All for $20.  The appetizers were OK.  The calamari wasn't worth it in my opinion.  It was cold and a bit tough.  The hummus was excellent.  The pita bread tasted nice and smokey (how'd they do that) and the hummus itself was green and had feta which gave it a nice salty taste and texture.  I'll definitely come back.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the service was quite slow.  However, our server made up for the slow service in her nice and friendly attitude.  Plus, it wasn't her fault.  There were only 2 servers that night because someone had called in sick."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I love Greek food and saw the great reviews. Went there last weekend with my family and we ended up leaving before we even ordered. The food did look amazing but the restaurant was very, very dirty...tables were dirty, there was dirty flatware on the floor, menus were all damp with dried food on them, and the high chair was covered in old food, especially dried yogurt. I get that kids are messy but it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. It was just the combination of all those things that made us decide to leave."}
{"text":"Wonderful place if you're feeling some Greek vibes! I love the giant vase in the middle and the beautifully simplistic Greek accents all around the place. Our server was also from Greece and was super friendly and attentive (granted we were the first people for the dinner service and the only people in the restaurant for a while, but still). I took my parents out here for their anniversary, as we're Eastern European, Greek food a little close to home. We ordered calamari, 4-dip platter and the flaming cheese for starters. The calamari wasn't greasy at all and the tzaziki was SO good! Their pita was wonderfully soft and dips were also all really good!   For mains, we got the mixed grill and greek salad to share between the 3 of us. The mixed grill was AMAZING! All different kinds of meat and they were all perfectly cooked, incredibly juicy and super flavourful. None of us are a huge fan of lamb, but they prepared it so well that we all loved it. The mixed grill is normally for 2 people, but with the large greek salad, it was definitely enough for the 3 of us. I made a reservation on opentable is advance and mentioned in the comments that it was a special occasion, so the staff came out with a piece of coconut cake and a message on the plate wishing them a happy anniversary. It was a very sweet gesture from the staff and my parents definitely were surprised and appreciated it!   Great quality of food and very friendly staff! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I had the Giovetsi with lamb.  The lamb is the best lamb I've had to date as the meat was falling off the bone.  Service was wonderful as we arrived early and had full attention.  My wife had the Greek mojito which I highly recommend.  Overall this was a good experience and the food was good.  I have had better Greek cuisine, but not by much.  This place is a nice place to go to for a change of pace.  The staff is the highlight.  If you want to be treated like a king without the pretentious atmosphere this could be your place!"}
