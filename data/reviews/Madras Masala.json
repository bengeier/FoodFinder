{"text":"The food was delicious and not overly spicy. The service was very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the only Indian place I've ever seen with a patio. On a gorgeous day it was so nice! 

For an appetizer we got the onion badji with tamarind and cilantro sauces. It was very good. The other appetizer we got was something with whole chick peas in it and covered with yogurt, tamarind sauce, and cilantro sauce. It was served cold and I didn't care for it that much.

We got some soft drinks and they were charmingly served in glasses with a bowl of ice and a spoon on the side. 

For our main courses we got the chicken kothu paratha, and two lamb curries, one tender. All were good. We had it served with paratha and rice. 

Overall a great evening."}
{"text":"This by far the best South Indian restaurant I haven to outside of India. We were two of us and we ordered a mutton masala dosa, Hyderabadi mutton dum biryani, mutton chettinad.  Each dish was absolutely delicious! I love the idea of mutton masala stuffing for the dosa. Every thing was presented well also.  The waiter was extremely friendly.  The place is not big nor well decorated, but the food makes overlook any flaw they may have!  If you are in Toronto, this is a must restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Great food. Delicious dosa (a nice thin rice and lentils crepe). The sweet lassi (yogourt drink) is frothy and yummy. Order a thali (not necessarily written on the menu) and you won't regret it. Decor is simple, basic, not pretentious. Washroom experience could be a bit better."}
{"text":"This place is our local and we're never disappointed. 
Service is great and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dosas west of Yonge.

Prompt, courteous service. Great chicken and fish masala dosas -- my 3 year-old loves the cheese cone dosas. Laid-back, welcoming atmosphere. What's not to love."}
{"text":"Not even worth a star but because yelp requires atleast one hence giving it. My family and I went for dinner on Boxing Day and the food was PATHETIC. My entire family fell sick. Each and everyone vomited the whole night with stomach flu for 3 days until we felt better.

Even if you are starving and these guys give you free food please AVOID!!"}
{"text":"Would give a three! Super untasty chicken fried rice with lots of green peas in it! It had big lumps of white rice which seemed to be not mixed at all properly! Rest Dosa was good! Sambhar could be better! Paneer chilly tasted like umm yeah ok! But I didn't get the reason of adding green peas to Hakka stuffs! Even to the chicken fried rice! Green peas is added to Pulaos and veg biryani by my knowledge and not at all to Hakka stuffs!"}
{"text":"The food tastes awesome. They have a dedicated team of staff who are running around taking orders from the customers. There is a constant stream of customers pouring in everyday! They also have take-out and delivery options. 
I tried almost all their south Indian dishes. I can safely assure prospective customers that the foods served here are as authentic as South Indian food can get. I was pretty surprised by the fact that so many Canadians love Indian food as they kept coming in droves to this restaurant.
If you live/stay in the Little Italy locality in Toronto, this place is a must-go. Its worth it!"}
{"text":"By far the best Dum Biryani I have eaten here in TO. The food at this place is authentic, no bs here."}
{"text":"This is my home-away-from-home (even though its only a couple blocks from me).  Its a small restaurant, that used to be a donut shop (I think), and sits right next door to another indian restaurant (Banjara).  That gets a bit confusing for some people.

The menu, however, couldn't be any more different.  I love their dosa! And cashew rice pulao, and chicken hyderabadi.  I don't think I've had anything on the menu that I didn't like.

The staff are great, and very friendly.  Always willing to recommend something, or make something off-menu.   I'm thinking I'll go here for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery from this restaurant and I have to say the food was amazing. The food came in less that 45 minutes, and even though it was freezing outside, the food was hot! I don't eat meat and the person who took my call was very patient and helped me order food. The food itself was really good, a bit spicy but if you can handle spice its really good. I ordered dosa and even though it was really good its the same as eating it at the restaurant, only because it doesn't remain crispy. Over al though this place has amazing food! I am definitely ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Listen, this is not glamourous food. This is good cheap eats Indian style. 

The paper roll dosa is divine, the spinach/mint one is sublime. I have never ventured out of the dosa arena at this place because they are just so damn good I haven't felt the need to. I literally find reasons to walk my ass up to the annex around lunch time to have an excuse to go here. I even gave some dosa to my 7 month old because I think it's that damn good. 

Forget Banjara which has gone very down hill over the past few years. Madras Masala is where it's at!"}
{"text":"A great place for south indian food..this place has the best DOSA in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Madras Masal many times, and have had great food each time.
I recommend the dosas especially.
I find it reasonable, not fancy dining by any means, but delicious and complex in their spicing."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Plenty of Gluten Free & Vegetarian options. Their Dosa is light, the filling is full of flavour & the variety of chutneys make every bite unique. Great Patio!
Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Great idlis and good food overall. Great service as well with very courteous people. Will definitely go there again !"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expected. Surprised with a giant crepe with currency chicken inside. Very good. Service was a but slow on a Thursday evening. Current goat was also delicious, already planning to go back tonight."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a huge craving for dosa and decided to make our way to Madras Masala. While the dosas did satisfy our craving, I can't say we were blown away by them.

We ordered an idli to start. The idli was not as fluffy and soft as we expected. However, I liked the sambhar and the orange chutney they serve with the idli and dosas. My masala dosa was average and my husband found the chilli cheese dosa to be too spicy (which NEVER happens as his tolerance level for spicy food is very high!).

Service was good.

The other area for improvement was the cleanliness. I don't know if I am being too picky, but I didn't get the perception of this being a super-clean place."}
{"text":"I took my best friend Oupary as we are adventurous when it comes to food and since my friend has never had Dosa I thought why not try Madras Mahal because it was next to my other favourite Indian Restaurant.  

We ordered 2 Dosa's... The Chicken Dosa & The Masala Potato & Onion Dosa. It was delicious, mouthwatering & not as heavy as it looks. 

The restaurant has a beautiful patio but lacks in the interior of the restaurant, not much space if you want to come in a group. 

The menu has a great selection. It was hard to choose. But the kind waiter went through their popular Dosa's."}
{"text":"In all honesty, we ended up there, because Banjara was crazy full. The decor is not great, and lighting too bright but the food was awesome. We had 3 vegetarian dishes, all excellent. The Channa Saag was exceptional! The food was up there with the best The wait staff is superb, really nice and attentive. Absolutely we will be back."}
{"text":"Simply the best South Indian food in Toronto. The dosas are amazing. The sambar is crazy good. The South Indian and Goan curries are perfect. The Naan is fantasic. And to top it all off the service is top notch. Its definitely not a fancy place, they've put all their energy into making the food and the service very memorable."}
{"text":"Like many reviewers, we ended up at Madras Masala because Banjara's was closed. We were cold and hungry, but our disappointment quickly turned to REJOICING.

None of us were familiar with Southern Indian food and I scratched my head when I saw what appeared to be a light brown leather hand bag sitting on a diner's plate. The waiter explained that it was a DOSA and that it was their restaurant's specialty. 

Our waiters (we had two) were amazing. They patiently explained various dishes and made recommendations that would suit the needs of everyone from my step father who loves extremely spicy hot food to my 14 yr old who can't handle anything hotter than yellow mustard. They recommended a variation of the Masala potato onion dosa (the one that arrives cut into pieces) and we were BLOWN AWAY! The taste, the texture, and just the sheer fun of eating a dosa made it an amazing culinary experience.  We quickly devoured it and asked for them to recommend another one. which they did, and which was equally delicious.

We also ordered the chicken curry (flavorful and tender) the sag paneer (even though it wasn't on the menu, I said I loved spinach and they kindly accommodated me) two variety rices (cilantromint and tamarind) both of which were light, fragrant and generous in portion), a chef's special (whose name escapes me) made up of pieces of bread and chicken tossed together (the flavor was great, but the texture and presentation reminded me a little too much of leftover Thanksgiving stuffing), garlic naan (chewy and yummy), and a spicy shrimp dish that had some serious kick, but was never overpowering.

I feel we just barely dipped our toes in the waters of Southern Indian cooking and can't wait to return to Madras Masala and dive in for more."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in all of Toronto. Food is always delicious and they have beer on tap. Came here before I was a parent and now bring my kid here as they have a kids menu and are very kid friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Be careful of the chicken, they don't know how to cook it.

I ordered the Xacuti chicken and found it to be undercooked.  I wasn't going to say anything, and was patiently eating around the uncooked centres of the chicken pieces, but when the waitress asked me how my meal was, I wasn't going to lie.  I told her the chicken was undercooked.

Just to be clear, the chicken wasn't pink on the outside where a marinade would change the colouring.  No.  The chicken was pink and gummy in the *centre*.

She took my chicken away, then came back and asked if I wanted butter chicken instead (which isn't on the menu).  She said I wouldn't have to pay for it.  She couldn't explain why she was offering me a different meal, and couldn't answer when I asked if the butter chicken would be properly cooked.  I asked for the Xacuti chicken again.  She came back with the Xacuti chicken.  I think they simply warmed it up in the microwave or something, because it was drier, but still undercooked.  I had run out of time for another do-over by then, so I pushed it aside and didn't eat it.

So she brought the bill which was $18.05 for undercooked chicken, plain rice, and a mild chai tea.  She explained to me that their chicken doesn't have bones.  ?????  She acted like that explained everything somehow.  Although I realize that that recipe can be made with bone-in chicken, I wasn't  upset about the lack of chicken bones.  I was concerned about food poisoning.  

Now I wonder what she told the cook.  Who was talking about bones?  And why did she offer me off-the-menu butter chicken?  Does she think I don't understand Indian cooking and can only accept mass-appeal butter chicken?  Should I be insulted?

In retrospect, I regret paying the full bill without arguing it further, and regret giving the girl a full 15% tip.  If she thinks serving potential food poisoning is reasonable, she needs training in basic food safety.  As does the cook."}
{"text":"A great Indian restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our dosas.  I had the masla dosa and it was huge.  Nice and spicy too!  Service was attentive and fast.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time getting take out there, and unfortunately, I found a bug in my saag. When I called to let them know, they apologized and delivered another to my home, but my stomach was too unsettled to eat it.

This is unfortunate, because I had heard good things about their food, and there aren't many other quality Indian restaurants in the area. I understand that with large amounts of vegetables, these things occasionally happen. But to me, the bug was large enough to indicate some carelessness in preparation. I will not return."}
{"text":"I don't remember what I had because my bf's food was too enticing so I was busily stealing his food. He had the cheese dosa which was so damn delicious! It was crispy and the cheese was like the kind u see in pizza commercials... it stretches for miles (okay maybe just centimeters). I will definitely be back to order that!"}
{"text":"Gluten sensitivity? You can eat a lot of items on the menu. They specialize in gluten-free although it's not a gluten-free dedicated kitchen. They have a beautiful little patio where we sat, although the inside needs a renovation but fine if you are here to taste great food. 

We started with the Pani Puri (Hollow Crispy Shells With Tamarind & Spicy Cumin Water).The pani puri is made of chick pea flour and a little bit of wheat flour, which the wait staff knew off the top of his head. It was crispy, tasty and everyone loved it. Next we tried the MASALA DOSA (Crepe Filled with Potato & Onion). The Dosa itself is massive, crispy and tastes like a slightly sour crepe. It's made mostly with bean flour but doesn't come with much onion or potato or other chutney. You get filled up with mostly Dosa. It wasn't to my taste but I really liked the experience as this was my first Dosa. Next we shared the HYDERABAD DUM BIRIYANI (World Famous Hyderabadi Biriyani, which was very flavourful, spicy, with tender bits of lamb. The portion was very large and this was my favourite part of the meal.

Overall great meal except for the Dosa. Service is excellent but interior needs work."}
{"text":"A friend and I made our way to Madras Masala to satisfy a dosa craving after getting the ball rolling with some apps at Barrio Coreano. A short walk up Bloor Street and we were there! The sun was shining down on us by that point in the afternoon so we decided to take advantage of their patio. 

I'd only had dosa once before and my recollection was hazy at best, so I deferred to my friend who suggested we go for the Masala dosa. Paired up with a couple of beers, the dosa made for nice patio snacking.

The dosa was served with three different sauces which provided a nice contrast in flavours. I won't pretend to be an expert on South Indian cuisine, but they ranged from mild to spicy. 

Because we were on the patio, I didn't get a solid look at the interior, but while passing through to the restrooms I noticed that it was a relatively small space. Room for 4 or 5 tables, tops. 

Not much more to say about this place, as we didn't stay too long. Got what we came for, and then it was on to the next one!"}
{"text":"As someone who is South Indian and who knows what great South Indian and North Indian dishes taste like, this place did not blow me away. I had high expectations when I read the other reviews but went there yesterday and was severely disappointed. We ordered the Vada Sambhar. The Vada did not taste fresh, the coconut chutney tasted like it was made ahead and frozen (really lacking any coconut flavour) and the sambhar was okay. We ordered the Rava Dosa and Onion Chilli Dosa. Both were mediocre at best, however their Tomato chutney was good. We also ordered the Malabar Kozhi curry which was delicious and had a great coconut flavour to it. All in all, our experience there was okay. We were definitely let down by the flavours. The Dosas are huge, you could share with someone if you are getting multiple dishes or an appetizer. The wait staff at the restaurant were clearly overwhelmed, there were only two of them to manage the whole place. I even saw one of them almost trip and fall because the walking space is so tight. The washroom was also filthy and I'm lucky I only used it at the end of my meal. If you want authentic Dosas with fresh delicious chutney, I would go to Gurulukshmi in Mississauga. I wouldn't waste my money on this place."}
{"text":"Not very good ambience. Doesn't leave a good impression of India. Food tasted good though however the mysore masala didn't have the special mysore chatni. Also the malai kulfi was a big expectations breaker !

Worth a visit if you are in Toronto and wish to dive in some South Indian specilities"}
{"text":"Simply the best dosa I've ever had and I'm from South India. The dosas are crispy if you get the paper version and their molagapodi (aka Gunpowder) is spicy and full of flavour. Service is great with the servers greeting us by name by our third visit and always treating us like VIP customers. 

Make sure you finish your meal with the Madras coffee. Though they use brew brand coffee powder to make, it rounds off the meal perfectly. 

The place is a bit of a dive but it's easily forgivable because it has confidence and authenticity. This is how a roadside dosa place would be like in India and you get a free trip there if just for an hour."}
{"text":"Get out of my way if I'm trying to get a seat at Madras Masala. The lesser known Indian restaurant at Christie Pitts. It's South Indian, delicious, and the service is fantastically friendly. My favourite Indian in the city. Pani Puri!"}
{"text":"My first experience with dosa so I don't have anything to compare this to.  Our party of 7 all ordered dosas.  Dosas are a type of thin crepe, the ones we had were made of rice flour.  We ordered dosa masala (potato with onion), the one with cheese and I ordered the one with vegetables.  It comes with 2 sauces for dipping, one made of cilantro,  one with coconut and a small bowl with a type of tamarind sauce.  Yummy!  

I would say this is more of appetizer than dinner since some of us were still hungry later.


The price was $6.77 each including tax.  Service was slow since I noticed some people who were seated after us received their order first.  

I don't know if I would come back, I'd like to try other South Indian dishes and I heard some other places might be worthwhile to check out."}
{"text":"It's not a fancy looking place but if you are looking for good Indian food you will find it here . Great dosa, yummy chutney , sambar like home , even the Biriyani is much better than anything you will find in any Indian restaurant in North America. 
I was very surprised to find such well prepared Indian food in a restaurant with such simple decor . 
Our server was also very nice and respectful, which is also not common in Indian restaurants. 

What a nice experience"}
{"text":"My first time eating dosa. I tried the chilli cheese one and it was great. I really enjoyed the coconut chutney; the tomato chutney was good too. The dahi vada was a very appetizer too. Big servings and not pricey."}
{"text":"Four words: chilli cheese masala dosa. 
It is SO good. I had never had a stuffed dosa before, so when it came (it was twice the size of my head) i was in shock, but i ate the WHOLE thing. It was dense, gooey, potato-ey, spicy. I'll just say it again... it was SO good. I tried the special rava dosa but the chilli cheese is way better. The place is small and sometimes you might have to share a table with someone, but go. Go and eat the giant dosas. 
Also, there's limited parking out front, but if you drive to the other side of christie, there is plenty of free parking there. You will need the walk after you eat anyway."}
{"text":"This is the best neighbourhood Indian restaurant one could hope for. Varied menu focusing on South Indian (great dosas), but not exclusively so (love the Hyderabadi biryani). A friendly host who is happy to recommend dishes and has never steered us wrong. In fact, after half a dozen visits, we've pretty much settled on asking him what we should have. Huge portions - must remember to order less, or wheelbarrow required to take us home."}
{"text":"I want to give Madras Masala four stars but I can't. After many visits to Madras Masala, I have to admit that their dosas are good but they are not outstanding. 

We ordered the veggie cutlets and medhu vada as appetizers and paper masala dosa as mains. The veggie cutlets were filled with spiced potatoes breaded and fried to a crisp and paired well with the mint and tamarind chutneys. The cutlets were a nicely-sized portion and were easily shared between two people. Yummy!

The medhu vada (fried savoury lentil \"donuts\" aka vada served with sambhar and coconut chutney) was only OK. The vada were not crispy and both the sambhar and coconut chutney lacked flavour. Disappointed!

The paper masala dosa was beautifully large and perfectly crispy. The crepe aka the dosa was not very warm by the time it reached our table. The potato filling aka the masala was good. The coconut chutney was bland, maybe even stale. The sambhar was too mild. Overall, the star and saving grace was the tomato chutney which gave the savoury dish a slightly sweet tartness. 

Overall, I will be back because there are many other dishes to try!"}
{"text":"My first dosa ever (I know, I don't know why it took me so long) was from Madras Masala so I don't have anything to compare it to. However, it was delicious. I mopped up everything on the plate. I will definitely be back to try more dosas."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!

I'm from south India and know a good sambar from a bad one, and this place was amazing. I had the Idli with the three chutneys and they were all so good. The idli was extremely soft and tasted great. I tried the Masala Dosa as well and liked that too but I will definitely be coming back for the Idli and the tomato chutney :)"}
{"text":"Had a very satisfying masla dosa here which was the size of the table! Hubbie had the kottu paratha and they made it super spicy and even added an egg per his requests. Service was great for a small joint. Not a fancy place for hosting guests or taking dates but the food will keep you coming back. Place was packed on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH. 

The setup is a bit odd but who cares when the food is delicious!! 

I love the Chettinad Biryani. So different the Hyderabadi Dum Biryani my momma makes! I've made all my friends go here to try it out. Their raiti is excellent too! I haven't had a chance to try out their dosas or their sister restuarant - Banjara, but next time. 

Don't take big groups, it cannot accommodate more than 4-5 people in a group. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"great food! and a much cheaper option than some of the other indian restaurants downtown. been here several times now and the south indian choices- dosas, sambar, idlis are delicous."}
{"text":"After hearing from a real-live Indian Yelper that this was Toronto's \"most like mom used to make\" Dosa, I headed straight here.  After a walk across the Christie Pits park, I encountered not 1 but 2 Indian restaurants side by side.  While Madras Masala has a small white with black print sign, the other place has a HUGE yellow sign. Stay to the right to enter a former coffee shop type of restaurant. The place was full by the time we left, so that's got to be a good sign. The number of Indians was also a good sign. 
Madras Masala doesn't limit itself to South Indian food such as Dosa or Uttapam, but pulls out all the usual curries, naan and such.  
To experience the most we could, we got one dosa, one uttapam and a rice dish.  The Dosa was crispy, oily and had a small dallop of well-spiced potatoes.  The Uttapam was a little under done and wet on the top bubbly part. The sauces were fine, but just not what I have grown to expect. 
You'll never forget your first dosa. If mom used to cook like this, then sure, I could imagine this is your favorite. But, Dosa (San Francisco) was my first dosa experience and so far Saravhana Bhavan still comes closest in taste to what I crave. 
Surprisingly alcohol is served here, unlike some other dosa places. I tried the unremarkable chai. I should have had a wine?"}
{"text":"Second time having dosa and first time in a restaurant setting...it was great. The dosa is their specialty and it comes in many fillings/forms. The sambar is great and the tomato chutney is condensed tomato. The portion is huge. Dosa itself is nice and thin and the edges are crisp. Definitely would try more. We had the onion chilli masala one which comes with loads of onions and the green chili can be very spicy...again, tons of onion and don't get if you are worried about onion breath.

We also tried the mutton paratha which is nicely seasoned and it is like an Indian alternative to North American stuffings...also you will be stuffed; it's dense.

Dhai puri was interesting. Not my cup of tea but it is very crispy.

Service is good, price is decent, and it has a nice patio for the summer. 

Overall: come here for dosa!"}
{"text":"Excellent south indian food. One of the best dosas I have had in some time. The chicken dum biryani is just amazing! The chicken is seasoned and cooked so well that it literally melts in your mouth. Kudos to the chef!

The place has a local Indian restaurant vibe. Not a fine dining place. However, the prices are comparable to a fine dining restaurant. The food quality and service justifies it though. 

I highly recommend checking this place out if you like South Indian and Hyderabadi food."}
{"text":"Their chicken biryani is really good. Enough spicy and quite a good quantity for two. Chicken 65 is yet again very good with curry leaves etc and reminds me of kerala style chicken. We went again to have the chicken 65, the taste didn't disappoint us but the quantity was really less this time. May be ''Take away'' plays a better trick! We also had Mysore Masala Dosa which was not good. The dosa was not crispy but thick. The stuffed potato bhaji was very bland. Looked like they have only mashed the potatoes with minimal spices. The sambar consistency was not correct and too thick with little flavors. Have heard people speaking so much about the dosas but it was not upto the mark. May be some unusual dosa varieties they have are better. But yes, if you do not make dosas back home, not a south Indian or have not had dosa since a very long time in Toronto then you may still like it. We personally didn't."}
{"text":"Your stomach might hurt the next day but it's well worth the minor discomfort to try Madras Masala. I heard about the dosas here and wanted to try it since I've never experienced a \"dosa\" before (the closest being a thicker, spongier pancake at a restaurant in Little India which the name eludes me right now). 
I tried the \"Chilly Cheese Masala Dosa\", \"Kadhai Paneer\" and \"Gobi Manchurian\" while my meateating friends ordered a lamb dish and the mysore (might want to reconsider a namechange) masala dosa. There were four of us and that was plenty of food. Don't be alarmed at the size of the dosa. It is after all as thin as a crepe. You could see the red chili flake specks in the dosa. It was crispy, greasy, and holy crap! spicy! (I'm not prone to select \"white\" whenever there's a chili meter option either). The dosa comes in a triangular shape on a metal platter with some dipping sauces. In one of the corners, it's filled with potato mash. 
The Kadhai Paneer was not as memorable but maybe because I was so enamoured with the \"Gobi Manchurian\". it's what I imagine General Tsao Chicken tastes like if I ate meat. It was cauliflower coated in this thick, crispy batter and a gingery sauce sticking to it. Very delicious!
As for service, I think we annoyed the waiter with our presence. My friend ordered a bottle of beer but he brought a draft beer and the look on his face indicated that we shouldn't bother putting up a fuss about it. We're easily intimidated people. 
Other than that, the price was very good (rice, 2 dosas, 3 dishes and a beer each split amongst 4 people came to around $22 with tip & tax).
I love Madras Masala's neighbour, Banjara but if I crave a dosa, this is definitely the place to go (even if you have to pop a few peptos later)."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday, and the food was not as much like what most people talk about here.  There was barely anyone in the restaurant, an the service was very slow,  The sambar we got with our set dosa smelled like it was a month old. When we told the waiter about his, he said, oh ya, and disappeared.  Later he came to us with a bill.   I will never go back here!"}
{"text":"Dosa delivery ! I've ordered various dishes twice for delivery from here and as an Indian all I have to say its hands down the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. 
Would love to dine in some day soon"}
{"text":"Good and Bad. Awesome Dosa. I wanted to have some good south Indian food and it served me well.  Even Indian Masala Tea was good. Though Dahi Puri was sub standard, no complaints as I had gone for Dosa which was good"}
{"text":"I visit Madras Masala at least twice a month in the summer months. We've also ordered delivery a few times. The food is still decent, but the Chili Cheese Dosa has gone downhill. In fact, the last time, I had to search for any actual cheese. It also appears they switched to orange cheddar cheese as opposed to the nice white stuff they used before. They also haven't been able to make it spicy enough for me the last few times. I'm sensing a new cook or a quality issue.

It's still a solid choice, and the Coconut Milk Chicken Biriani is a great dish. Probably my fave rice on earth. 

I'll be back, but I want to know what happened to my dosa."}
{"text":"So the unfortunate reality about Toronto is that it's actually really hard to find great Dosas! That being said, Madras Masala is pretty good; you'll be just fine coming here as there really isn't a better option downtown that I know of. 

My 3 stars really should be a 3.5 but that's not possible with Yelp and 4 stars just doesn't seem right.

If you haven't experienced South Indian cuisine, then you will have no problem enjoying this place.

Most importantly, I can confidently say that I have been here multiple times and will return multiple times again in the future.

Enjoy. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the rava masala dosa and the chicken kothu parotha - delicious! As a South Indian, I can attest that this is close to authentic. The sambhar and chutney are tasty.

Now for the negative - service is really horrible. The wait staff never respond to your order/requests on time. I waited 25 min for masala chai. The guests in the table next to us walked over and picked up cutlery because the wait staff never showed up with cutlery after they got the food. The staff is friendly; not sure what the issue is but the service takes very long"}
{"text":"Came in to try this place cause craving for some dosai. Is actually pretty good and big portion. Is a little pricy for a dosai but is hard to get dosai in toronto. Most places almost charge around $8-$12 in toronto except you head to Scarborough or markham you could find cheaper and good dosai. Is not a big place and don't expect a good service there. Can give it a try cause the food is good."}
{"text":"I, like many others who live in the Annex, was a regular at Banjara and always pitied the poor, empty south indian restaurant next door. 

I hate that I waited so long to go!! 
I'll admit I only went because I had a voucher, but the food was lovely. 
Great service, too, unlike the neighbours, because I guess they have less customers. There is no waiting, etc.
We didn't even get dosas so we'll be heading back to try that out, but just regular paneer dish (a bit bland) and chicken dish (way better than neighbour) and then really interesting mango-ginger ice cream. 

very nice!! go there, they are great and need the business!!"}
{"text":"I have been craving dosas forever and FINALLY got my fix!! I ordered the gunpowder masala dosa. Warning, it's called that for a reason. You know when you eat a powdered donut and accidentally breathe in the icing sugar? Yah, that happened to me. But unlike icing sugar, this stuff will burn up your insides. STILL WORTH IT. 

Service was very friendly and thankfully I showed some restraint and ONLY ordered a dosa, since I couldn't even finish it. So pro tip, go with a bunch of people and share if you want to try everything. Also, this place has limited seating and got VERY busy after 7, so come early or get ready to wait!"}
{"text":"mmmm delicious dosa!
before I came to this place my fave and only one I knew south indian restaurant was south indian dosa at ossington (I think) now this one is one of the 2 south indian restaurants I love.

there is huge selection of dosas and lots of veg options. I can't say they are in anyway specifically different but I loved the taste. 

my friends had just regular indian food and liked it too. 

the service was very attentive and quick.

the locations wins - next to the christie park and def is great for those who just came from ice skating from the rink nearby just as we did=)"}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Food not always consistent but is really good when they're on their game.

Service is okay. A bit awkward, feeling as though they're not understand everything I'm saying. Sometimes it take a while to get the waiter's attention when it's busy.

Place is a little worn down but feels like one of those hole in the walls where the food is really authentic. It doesn't look like enough seating but they do have seating at the back as well.

I've try to change it up once in a while but have stuck to the chicken masala dolsa. So good and hearty. You can manage to eat it with a fork and knife but there's nothing wrong with using your hands. The wife is always happy with the variety of vegetarian selection. The naan bread is always fresh and just one piece is always enough.

Always have come back here when I crave Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"What this place lacks in ambiance and decor they more than make up for in the food.  

Had to try to the biriyani and dosas based on several reviews.   Mutton biriyani and the dosa with spinach.  Great flavours in both dishes.  Dosa is massive and very filling and prices are reasonable given the portion size.

Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Had the delivery and it was great.  They arrived when they said they would and the food was kept in a cooler so it was still piping hot when received. They also threw in a complimentary biscuit (can't remember the name)  as a starter and a goolab jamun as a desert. The vegetable Kofta is creamy and savoury and a definite must try.  Though i would like the kofta balls themselves to be a Little more crispy the soft texture may have been due to delivery time and container. The lamb xacutti was also good,  with the lamb being very tender.  The homestyle paratha was tasty but a little heavy and the herb naan was perfect."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend after work. Location is really convenient, just a stone's throw from Christie station. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, at least compared to it's neighbour which I suspect is owned by the same people but I don't know for sure. 

I ordered the lamb xacutti, homestyle paratha, and garlic naan for myself. Split an order of calamari pakoras and my friend ordered the chicken chettinad and rice.

Calamari pakoras were good! But for $5.50 I expected a bit more of them. The lamb xacutti was excellent. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the flavours of the dish were on point. The curries come in these small silver pots which are very deceiving. You think it's not a lot of food but it most definitely is! The paratha was really good, a little on the burnt side but was still delicious as was the garlic naan. If you like garlic and you like naan, get their garlic naan. It is probably some of the best garlic naan I've ever eaten and I've eaten garlic naan in a number of restaurants. When you order the paratha or naan, it's a single order of bread just fyi. In my books, still definitely worth it. The chicken chettinad was also very good. My friend got it medium spicy but after tasting it she wishes she got it full spice. It came with good sized chunks of tender chicken.

Our bill came to $45 after tax and we were positively stuffed. The waiters were friendly and to be honest, in places like this I don't care much for service if the food is amazing and cheap. My barometer for eating food from a certain culture is if people from that culture eat there and let me tell you there were a number of people from that part of south Asia who were eating there.

Will definitely come back again. Food is just too good not to!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the hyderabad dum biryani with mutton. The mutton was very tender and the biryani was cooked well! Also had the special rava masala dosa which was good, and the fish dosa. I didn't like the fish in the fish dosa - it tasted super fishy. The dosa itself was still tasty though, dipped in all the different sauce options!"}
{"text":"wonderful restaurant!! The food is exeptional. If you like spicy indian food you'll love this place. The staff is super friendly, fast, and curtious. Their curry platters as well as their eggplant is quite good. I was a huge fan of their naan bread. I think I ended up taking a whole bunch home. The ambiance of the restaurant isn't the best.....but their food makes up for that all the way. The best part is they are close to my house and they deliver now too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Just awesome. 

Came here with 14 people for a work lunch. The waiters were so accommodating and the food was so good!!!! The decor although lacking did not bother anyone. 

So friendly. Filled all of our waters a million times. We're incredibly attentive to our every need. 

On top of this the food was fantastic and HUGE... most of my team got:

7. Pani puri - like little crispy shots of green sauce and chickpeas and potatoes 
8. Papri chat - crispy Indian nachos covered in sour cream
4. Medhu vada - south indian dish salty donuts with a coconut and vegetable dip

71. Kothu paratha best one!! OMG this was good. Like a fried rice but made with torn up Naan. This was the best thing we had. It was SO good. I cannot explain how delishious this was.
90. Paper Masada dosa! Very cool and very tasty. It was a really cool experience. 

Mango ginger ice
112. Malaika kulfi"}
{"text":"We tried a couple of chaat and dosas. The chaat were good. We had cheese Mysore masala dosa and ghee masala dosa. The size of the dosas were huge compared to the restaurants we have had earlier but tasted just okay. Dosas were crispy but I felt they were little less tastier. For the size of the dosas, the chutney and sambar is not enough. The sambar and chutneys tasted good."}
{"text":"Unintentionally ended up here. Definitely not a bad thing though. I was with a buddy that is of Sri Lankan descent so he did all the ordering. We order Idly which was something I've never had before and the Dosa. I'm a huge foodie and am very open to trying new things. The Idly was great tasting, I'm happy I had it here first so I know what to expect elsewhere. The Dosa on the other hand, I've had at other restaurants but I must say, I was quite surprised when it arrived at our table. The size was very large and crispy and the fact that there was cheese inside was such a delightful addition since I've never had a Dosa with cheese in it before. Sauces and curries were very flavourful... Or maybe we were just hungry from all the walking we did prior to. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place has amazing dosas. I had the gun powder, rava masala, and the Mysore masala ones. All of them very tasty. Plus the chutneys are very good as well. Seating outside is also a plus as the indoors part of the place is small.

I already came to this place five times just this month, and will definitely keep on coming back"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for the last year to find a good Dosa place! I think my quest has come to an end! Last night my boyfriend and I came here to try out the place. First off, I was off work late so we arrived with literally 40 minutes left and they didn't turn us away, even though we were there way after closing still eating.

We ordered the Chicken 65 for an appetizer. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. It would of been a lot better if they were actual chicken pieces, they were like chicken bites in a way. Little rolls of chicken perhaps?

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Dosa and I ordered the Masala Dosa. When they came out my boyfriend was in disbelief with how huge his chicken dosa was. He liked his Dosa so much and for once he couldn't finish his food! Luckily, he has leftovers for the next day because it was so good!

For myself, the Masala dosa was amazing! Right amount of potatoes and onions and that tomato chutney is my favourite! I finished all mine! (Curious what that says about me? Hahaha) I will definitely be back again! This will be my new place for sure!

The only reason for the four star is, it was a little slow getting the drinks back out when we ordered them again. Other then that amazing!"}
{"text":"A great place for authentic South Indian food! Their dosas are crisp and delicious. The Hyderabad biriyani is mouth-watering! The servers are pretty cool dudes too. On my last visit, I had accidentally left my umbrella at the table and walked quite a few steps away from the restaurant when the server comes running down the hill to hand it back to me. Seems like a trivial matter to mention but I thought it complemented the overall friendly service I experienced at this place."}
{"text":"We ordered (for delivery) lamb Madras, lamb Hyderabadi, gobi korma, an aloo paratha, and paneer pakora. Everything was delicious; the pakoras came with tiny containers of chutney and these guys even threw in a (single, cute) gulab jamun.

One star off because, let's be real, for these prices rice or chapatti should be thrown in."}
{"text":"We had gone there to eat masala dosa ... But then we eat Pani puri which was extremely delicious.. we could not resist to eat just one. So we had to order 8 more plates"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile but was craving Indian food.
I got the coriander potatoe dosa.
Good: good size, sambar nice
Bad: the filling is bit mushier not too many chunks of potatoes. I'm used to getting the coriander mixed with my potato but the coriander was like thin paste put on my dosa itself.  The unfortunate result was not crispy edges.  the dosa was still tasty to eat 
Sambar: I liked it. Was mild so if you want Indian hot, this is not the place. It taste homemade. But if you want an extra side of it as I found it wasn't enough, you are charged for it  $1 but I've been places where it's no extra charge.

Overall decent place for dosas. Can't say it's my favourite but it will do in a pinch"}
{"text":"Delicious butter chicken and naan. Its not on the menu, just ask for it. Also friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"You guys. I have an addiction to dosa and so any time I'm in a close vicinity to a place that makes dosa I HAVE to go there. Luckily Evelyn W knows me well and planned our lunch outing at Madras Masala.

Have you seen the pictures for this listing? The dosas are so giant there is no way I should be able to eat one all by myself. But, they are also so delicious that I did just that. And I'd do it again. I ordered the Madras Masala dosa because I figured if they named it after the restaurant it had to be a signature item. It turns out that number 89, just called Masala dosa, is the original, but after just one bite I didn't care.

The place was pretty empty when we stopped in for a late lunch, but the service was spectacular. I also loved that they had a kid's section that included dosas shaped like Mickey Mouse and mini versions of big meals. 

And now, I'm dreaming of dosa until my next fix..."}
{"text":"Dnt visit this place worst customer service I ever had in Indian restaurant, a waiter took out order and came after 45 minutes asking to verify order as he forgot to punch in his system also promised us he will give our bill complimentary, but when our bill came there was no discount and we didn't even wait to argue paid our bill and promised will never eat there in life and wont refer anyone to go there."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and has rude waiters with no customer service. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"We were the first customer on the day of Christmas eve.. But the service was quick. We ordered spicy chai, Idly vada combo and chilly cheese masala dosa and dahi puri.. Everything was nice. I do recommend. The size of the dosa is too big. Spicy chai is best for getting rid from a headache."}
{"text":"Soo good!!! This just became my favourite dosa spot. I always get the Rava Masala Dosa and this one was exceptional. The crepe was very crispy and flavourful with onions, coriander, and cashew nuts. The masala inside was almost like a creamy Indian mashed potatoes. Chutneys were delicious as well. Now I don't have to go to scarb to get my fix!

Update: Been back a few times and I have to edit my review. Tried a few other dosas and the batter just wasn't to my liking. The chutney's were also very weak. I think I was desperate for a fixin' earlier on but now I've realized it's more worth it to drive to Nilgiri's in Brampton or Scarborough to eat a significantly better dosa. Still not a bad option in the city and the Rava Masala Dosa is decent enough."}
{"text":"It was the first time my husband tried South Indian food and he fell in love with it. 
Even my mom was eating, she does not have a big apetite but love the food.
I had a chilly cheese dosa woooowwwww amazing convination, we had chicken biryani and pani puri.
We were so happy we tried this restaurant.
I gave four stars because the place was very dirty, and dusty.
But the food was mind blowing.
Definately coming back for take out!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the paneer recipes. It always tastes really fresh and creamy... maybe not the healthiest but delicious. 

It's also pretty cheap and the service is good."}
{"text":"A+++ experience here. I will never go anywhere else for South Indian food. The servers were fast, efficient and extremely helpful. The food was absolutely delicious (so delicious that I ordered the same food to take home with me!) and very authentic. The masala dosa was perfect, same with the idli and sambar. The pani puri was so delicious that it made me think twice about ordering any mains and instead just ordering 4 more orders of it! The most stand out dish was the Goan lamb curry with coconut.... Even though I was so full I kept trying to eat more of it. It was really really good. I don't normally eat a lot of meat but this really made me happy. I will be back 100 percent! Don't hesitate to go here, seriously. Go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The dosas here are fine but the Mississauga Indian joints are much better on average. The filing is not as savoury and the edges of the dosa crumble apart a bit too easily. Ambience is also a bit drab. I guess if you live in Toronto, you don't have too many good choices hence the 3 stars. If this place was located in Mississauga, it wouldn't survive the competition."}
{"text":"so the fiance took me on a bday trip to toronto :)  ANd i insisted while ther we had to have him try his first dosa. He kept asking what is it??...... my answers were one of these two statements every time he asked \"dont worry about\" or \"its delicious thats all you need to know\". lol  He looked stuff up and decided it was a rice pancake and thought it sounded boring. I said just you wait.
SO we stopped in madras masala while we were wandering around the city. I order all veg (which i almost never do) and the fiance took it in stride. I ordered my fav since i was a kid puchkas!!! They call them pani puris, but they'll always be puchkas to this bengali. ANd we also got the mysore masala dosa. 
The dosa was great and exactly what a first dosa experience should be for someone. The fiance conceded indeed there was nothing boring about this crispy \"rice pancake\". He also loved the sambar. I myself am always partial to the coconut chutney that comes with.
We had fun with the pani puri but iv never found a place outside of india that makes them quite right....but then what do ya expect i guess. We ate every bite so clearly they werent bad by any means ;)
The menu was pretty big and i'd have loved to try more stuff but we were being good so alas till next time for the gobi manchurian, the chat and all the other delicious things that i crave!!"}
{"text":"The vibe: A cute and small Southern Indian place right next to Banjara which has always seemed strange to me, except I recently found out that it's apparently all in the same family. Which makes a lot more sense. 

The food: I've only tried the Dosa Madras Masala, so I can't say TOO much, but it was great! I think I'm more of a curry gal myself, so next time I'll have to try one of their curries. I need naan in my life, ya know?

My go to meal: TBD! Must try more. 

Secret: There's a nice patio in the summertime.."}
{"text":"So I went to Madras Masala last weekend near Christie station. And I mention the station because we went by car and struggled to fine parking lol. Next time I might go through the station - but that's a good thing, there is a next time!  

So this a cozy little South Indian restaurant however I noticed that their menu extends beyond South Indian dishes, which is a good thing of course, however my friend and I decided to stick to our plan of coming here for the dosa. And we're glad we did because these are some of the biggest dosas I have seen! 

I ordered a rava dosa which was about a 1m long but super thin and folded nicely on my thali. My friend had a chilli onion dosa which was also huge and filled with chopped onions. I didn't like the onion dosa so much because I thought the onions wouldn't be raw but I guess that's how you are supposed to eat an onion dosa? I really don't know. But my rava dosa was on point! And it had curry leaves and cashews and spices in the rava dosa! A really good experience with my first ever rava dosa. 

However when it comes to the potato filling and chutnies....that's where I wasn't so happy. The potato filling that I was served seemed a bit watery lol. I'm new to south indian foods but i have tried other potato fillings that were more oily and not watery. Not sure if it's always like this, but I didn't like the potato masala. As for the tomato chutney....It was good but a bit different than what I'm used to. But the coconut chutney was yummy and authentic. And Sambar, Sambar is always good :) 

Overall this is a place I would return to for the dosas which were about $10 a plate. And I would return to try some of the other dishes as well. I also want to try the chili cheese dosa that everyone talks about. Service was really good too on top of that, and we got to talk to some nice people there. Overall it's worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. Excellent service - waiters are eager to help you and want to make sure you're happy with the food. The biryani was the best I've ever had. Really flavourful and not dry at all. The Dosa (rice thin ones) was quite nice. The chicken curry and paneer was also really tasty. Only complaint was that there was cold air coming out of the vent for the whole time and we were quite cold. But since the food was spicy, it was a nice breeze for the guys who were sweating. :P"}
{"text":"OMG Dosa heaven!! After passing over Madras Masala for far too long in favour of our beloved Banjara, my partner and I decided to finally give this place a try. We love dosas and South Indian flavours, but have been spoiled by mostly experiencing these dishes through home cooking, so our anticipation and expectation levels were very high going in. I am pleased to report that Madras Masala was a winner on all points. We had the dhai puri, mutton paratha, and onion chili masala dosa. First, the puri: huge, delicious and crisp puri filled with potato and chick peas, topped with a bright cilantro chutney, sweet tamarind sauce and tangy yogurt. Slightly awkward to eat, but the taste is worth the chipmunk cheeks: stuff it in and savor! 

Now, onto the star of the night: the dosa. Oh my god. First off, it was huge. HUGE! It came with two chutneys (tomato and coconut), sambar, and a cool soothing raita. The dosa was crisp on the edges and soft around the filling portion, which was a seasoned mashed potato mixture. The onion/chili was not inside, but rather was served finely chopped, raw and generously spread on top of the dosa, adding heat and wonderful flavor to each bite. Even the humble sambar was a step above, as it tasted freshly made and house-blended, rather than coming from a powder. Dipping bites of dosa into it just made the whole experience complete.

Also i should note that service tonight was awesome: very fast and helpful, and water refills were plentiful and well-timed. Despite the place being packed to the gills and being seated on the patio, we were very well tended-to.

Overall: highly recommend for a massive dosa deliciousness!! (See what I did there?)"}
{"text":"The best South Indian food you can find in Downtown! I came here with my sister and her fiancé and had an amazing dinner! 

We ordered the Pani Puri, Calamari Pakora, Mutton Dosa, Chicken Dosa, Madras Marsala Lamb Curry. The portions are very generous. You could order two entrees to be shared with three people. 

The Pani Puri is a street food. There is a lot of textures and flavours that just sing in your mouth. The Calamari pakora is battered with chickpea flour. Its thicker but adds such nice flavour.

The Dosa is the reason what we came for! It is like a thin crepe served with your choice curry, tomato jam and coconut sauce. All the flavours combined makes a wonderful umami of flavours. 

Edit: I came again a second time with my husband. He is a professional chef and he was also really impressed with this restaurant and he is so hard to please! So you must try it."}
{"text":"Popped in here on New Year's when I was craving dosa and South Indian Dosa Mahal was closed due to the holiday. Very glad I did; restaurant was crowded but the food was tasty and fresh and portions were ginormous--more than enough for lunch the next day. I was leaving for NYC in the morning and trying to use up my Canadian money so the waitress even shaved a little off my bill to make it work. Keep giving that dosa love to the starving masses, guys!"}
{"text":"This is a very good South Indian place and their specialty is the 'Madras Masala' curry which can come with any kind of meet - I had the chicken.  Curry was great, but the vegetables were added later, so they were not cooked properly, which is annoying.

Also had Lentils Soup - great, Dosa - pretty average, Lamp Briyani - great, and few other items, all of which were good, but not the best indian in Toronto. 

The ambiance is nice, we were 4 people so stayed on the patio, sunny and a bit away from Bloor, so you don't get exhaust gasses."}
{"text":"I'm not a big dosa guy. They have dosas here. Apparently they're good. I wouldn't know.

What I do know is biryani. And curries. And meat. Amazing value. Terrific flavour. Super friendly family service. One of the best Indian joints in the city."}
{"text":"I randomly had a dosa craving, so decided to hit up this place since it gotta pretty decent reviews.

I was pretty disapointed - While the flavors were okay, the dosa itself was not thin and crispy.

Also...I overheard the waiter telling a customer that they freeze the dosa batter....*frowns*

Id rather travel to Brampton for a good fix!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. Excellent very attentive service (I drink a lot of water so really appreciate it when my glass is refilled without me asking). We both had the dosas again - chicken and I had the fish this time (had the mutton the first time). 

Not sure what we are eating with the extras that come with it, but it's all delicious and enough for two meals.  I like that it's a place you can go to and have a private conversation and not have to shout to be heard. 

I had a voucher the first time but not this time, I was just craving a dosa - shows that the vouchers do work in getting new customers! Thanks! Will be back. 

PS - bonus - FREE parking right in front!"}
{"text":"Very nice
Came here alone, the wait staff was very friendly and kind.

The quantity of food is amazing, I felt like I was right at home.

My only problem with this place is cleanliness and decor."}
{"text":"Upping to five stars.  Everything on return visits has been equally good.  Madras chicken is a great non-vegitarian entree."}
{"text":"I found the thali nice but not very authentic. Still enjoyed it but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place, my wife and i were outside reading the menu trying to decide of it was a good place and a father and son came out and talked us through the menu. Everyone was really friendly.

I had the Gunpowder Dosa and my wife had the Veggie Kofta Curry. We loved both dishes. I was stunned as to how huge the Dosa was but it was terrific.

The only down side was that my wife's dish came out 10 minutes after mine."}
{"text":"Visited twice in the past week. Service is great, they will do what they need to to make sure that you have an enjoyable experience.  You can go one of two ways. Go with a Dosa for a complete Southern Indian meal (about 40 to choose from) or go with a mix of southern india or chino indian plates to share with others. I recommend the Gobi Manchurian."}
{"text":"Madras Masala is an Indian spot full of character perched at the edge of Christie Pitts park. It's almost impossible to miss because all it takes is following your nose. I've had Indian food a handful of times in my life. I think the last time I tried it I was 18. So I was super hesitant to try this place. I'm glad I tried it. 

 I had an Indo Chinese chicken fried rice and some chicken manchurian. It was good. For someone not too familiar with this type of food, it's a good starter. I think the best thing here is the dosa's. It's not on the menu, but spring coriander dosa's are delicious and a safe non spicy start for anyone. They are also huge, unless you haven't eaten for a week you should have leftovers for a snack later. Also the almond chicken (Badami chicken) is freaking delicious. Creamy and with a slight nutty taste, it's really good. A lot of the food here is extremely flavourful and there is undoubtedly a lot of kick in their food. But I think if you go in here expecting that you should be fine. I also tried a bunch of appetizers (thool baji, paneer pakora, chicken 65) again all very good but a different flavour for me.

The server was awesome. He was patient and explained everything to our table. Also, he remembered everyone's order (about 15 of us) without a notepad. Impressive! The decor is not a reason to go but they have a patio that I imagine is nice to linger at in the summer. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"sambar and chutney is tasteless and ridiculous...the dosas are good but even for someone who loves butter there was way too much oil on them...i wouldnt repeat coz of the subpar sambhar and chutney"}
{"text":"Excellent food but the service could improve a little.

Staff: We had booked a reservation for 14 people online. However, it's just a contact form and no confirmation is ever sent. So we called to check to see if they got it, and they said they did. Unfortunately, when we arrived they seemed to be unaware of it so we ended up sitting in a weird 2 table formation. It wasn't ideal but my party made do. The food came quickly and the staff were all friendly. But the payment at the end seemed to take forever.

Ambience: The patio was very nice but I personally don't like eating outside because of bugs, so we opted to eat inside. It was long and small. The kitchen appeared to take up a huge chunk of the restaurant and the interior was nothing to write home about, but it was still comfortable enough.

Food: I had the Chicken Dosa and it was huge!! It was also mighty delicious! The chicken was soft and flavourful, the dosa was thin and yummy. The sauces were all excellent too. I was so stuffed by the end of the meal!

I will have come back soon because it was utterly fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian food! The interior is a bit tired and shabby but the food is amazing and the service is friendly and attentive. They also make good North Indian food as well. We eat here and at Banjara next door and they are almost equal in quality. South Indian dosas are delicious and worth trying."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night and fully enjoyed it. We got the set dosa with vede curry which was actually much like a uthappam in texture than a masala dosa, with a lovely spongyness. The vede curry was also lovely. We also ordered the  Karakozhambhu which is an okra curry, and a home style paratha, and an order of rice. All of our dishes were excellent, though nothing had much heat to it. The only complaint I'd really have is that the rice was a bit dry. Next time I'd skip the rice and order a second bread instead. A very solid meal, and one of the better ones we've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 stars.
Love the dosas here.
They are about 20% over priced.
4 star food an service.
3 star ambience and pricing"}
{"text":"I love Indian food, and I'm always trying to find the best Indian restaurant in Toronto. Unfortunately, most of the restaurants I've tried aren't that good. The best options are available outside the downtown core (in Mississauga and Brampton), but since I live downtown, I try to make do with what's available locally. 

I've eaten at Madras Masala three times, and ordered takeout at least half a dozen times. Each time, the food was consistently tasty, and usually well-made. Note that they use whole spices in their curries, so you may end up with a few bites filled with the over-spiced flavours of cardamom, cloves or curry leaf. They also use dark meat for their chicken dishes, so don't order chicken if you prefer white meat. Their lamb is really tender, so I usually order lamb instead of chicken. 

Here are the items I usually order:
Chicken hyderabadi: this dish is delicious, and served with DARK meat chicken. It's a savoury blend of saffron and yogurt, and it can be made spicy to order. I think the spicing goes better with chicken than lamb, but they also offer it as a lamb dish. 
Lamb pasantha: the lamb is super tender, and the dish is tasty and aromatic. It's lightly sweet, but the sweetness is balanced by fresh fenugreek leaves. 
Lamb chettinad: this dish is very well-spiced. It's a dark, rich curry that tastes heavily of cardamom, cloves and mace. 
Gunpowder dosa: their dosas are delicious! If you're getting takeout/delivery, ask them to wrap it in aluminum foil so the dosa doesn't get soggy on your way home. The gunpowder dosa is nice and spicy. 
Sag paneer: this isn't on their menu, but you can actually order anything from BANJARA's menu through Madras Masala, so you can get both types of dishes in one order. I've ordered channa masala and aloo gobi this way as well!

I'd recommend against ordering the paneer shahi. It's bland and just tastes like a bowl of semi-spiced yogurt with cubes of paneer (every bite made my mouth scream \"OMG TOO MUCH DAIRY\"). It was the worst dish I've ever ordered from Madras Masala."}
{"text":"After ice skating and tobaganning, we were hesitant on entering a nice restaurant with a tablecloth.  But the host, with his soft voice, unassuming nature and knowledge of everything indian, was delightful, and the extensive menu had us salivating.

Within moments, we were chipping off pappadum and dipping it into perfect coriander sauce and tamarind chutney. 

we ordered:

- Pani puri-- Indian street food that's hard to find. Pastry wafers filled with tamarind chutney and coriander water, that you \"pop\" in your mouth

- Idli-- sourdough rice and lentil cakes served with masala and chutneys. Tangy and chewy and light.

- Dosas of many kinds. Masala dosas, Spinach dosas, cheese doasas- - all with thick coconut chutney, tomato chutney and some other new flavors

It was just as good as homemade dosa and thali meals in Chennai!"}
{"text":"I tried the gobi manchurian and the gunpowder masala dosa. My wife tried the onion chilli masala dosa. The gobi manchurian was fresh and not overfried and the spices tasted good. Now my dosa tasted fine although the potato masala lacked punch and the tomato and coconut chutneys also weren't very fresh. A bit on the bland side. My wife was unhappy with the onion chilli because they used white onions and the pieces of green chilli were big. They are supposed to be chopped super fine. She wasn't impressed with the sambar and chutneys too. She seems to prefer Nilgiris in scarborough and I strongly prefer Guru Lukshmi in Mississauga for dosas. I still think it is not a bad place to try in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The dosas here are absolutely delicious. They look really big but they're smaller than they look since they're so flat, eating the whole thing is doable.

I had the mutton dosa and I tried a few bites of the chili cheese dosa, and both tasted great. The chili cheese dosa was particularly tasty, know that you can also get it with meat instead of potatoes if you wish. The tomato chutney that comes with the dosa was a great sauce to dip with, though I hear from my friends that it was quite spicy.... \"it builds up\"? I have a high tolerance, so I couldn't really tell.

There was also some deep fried paneer appetizer that was really good. Heck, everything I tried here was really good. I'll definitely be a regular for those post-workout meals :)

P.S. Music is great."}
{"text":"I love South Indian food and wanted to give this place a try because of the amazing Yelp ratings. 
This place exceeded my expectations! I went there for lunch (around 2pm) and ordered a Masala Dosa and salty lassi. The dosa was HUGE! (only $9.99) The dosa was fresh, crisp and came with sambhar, red chutney and white coconut chutney. The lassi was pretty good too ($2.50)!
The ambience was great! They were playing the latest Bollywood music :) 
If you live in Toronto, give this place a try instead of commuting all the way to Gurulakshmi in Mississauga (which is overrated in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Definitely the best South Indian in the city. You'll find better in Mississauga, but still really good. 

Especially appreciate shaking things up a bit with a meat or salmon Dosa. I've never ever seen a Dosa be anything but vegetarian anywhere in the world."}
{"text":"Madras Masala is Banjara's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/banjara-indian-cuisine-toronto) less popular, South Indian cousin. It's in the same building as Banjara, has the same owners, and prices are similar, yet it's not nearly as busy.

The space is a little awkward; it's in a former donut shop and it shows. It has that nice-ish feel that's common in Indian places; proper tablecloths and napkins, nice decor, attentive service, and so on. The waiter was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.

We had Chicken Xacutti ($11), Lamb Hyderbad ($11), Masala Dosa ($8), Paratha ($2.50), and Steamed Rice ($2.99). Both curries were good and the meat was tender, but I found them a little lacking in spice and flavour; maybe they toned things down for us whiteys. I'm not a huge dosa fan, but I enjoyed this version. It's huge and has a small ball of potato and onion curry in the middle  as well as a variety of sauces for dipping. While the paratha was great, I wasn't huge on the rice, it was dry and didn't taste fresh.

I love that the food doesn't feel nearly as heavy as the North Indian fare at Banjara. I assume this is due to less cream in the dishes.

Given that the mains were $11 each, plus the cost of rice or bread, I just didn't feel the quality was quite deserving of 4 stars. Next time I'll ask them to make the dishes as though they were making them for themselves, i.e. more flavour and spice, and I may give them another star."}
{"text":"My very first experience with authentic South Indian cuisine and I absolutely loved it! My boyfriend and I were wandering around the area to find a place for brunch but we ended up here, and I guess why not?

The place is tiny yet cozy. The staff was quick assigning seats for us. He was very nice and helpful. We ordered dosa and papri chaat. I was told that these dishes are one of the most popular street food in South India. The food came out late but they were warm and nice. 

Papri Chaat came out first with cilantro (hari) chutney. Indian tacos? Anyways, it is little crisp round spiced crackers, layered with spices, chickpeas and drizzled with yogurt. And the sweet, tangy and savory taste made me fall in love with this dish right away. I think I'm ready to try other \"chaats\" haha.

We ordered 2 different dosas and I was surprised of how big they are. Each dosa came with different types of chutneys: coconut chutney, tomato coconut chutney, and sambar.  They all tasted amazing! The cheese dosa was a bit salty though. They were all perfectly crispy and delicious. 

My first impression with real Indian cuisine was marvelous! I was impressed with the food and the staff here !! One of those hole in the walls where the food is pretty authentic (according to the boyfriend). But I will definitely come back to this restaurant to try out other dishes when I'm around this area."}
{"text":"Went there after a while, late at night around 9 ish, since its close by. Had forgotten how much the place reeks of masala. Just cuz you make Indian food you do not have to announce it to the world, MM (Neighboring Banjara is equally guilty of this)

The food is pretty pedestrian. The flavors felt brazenly out of a packaged spice box. Started off with some chicken appetizers, and ordered some naan, lamb chettinadu and dosa for the group. Dosa wasn't super great, prefer Udupi Palace. The lamb was spicy enough and the naan was fresh and fluffy.The food was very filling. So far so good.

However, service was pretty bad despite the fact that our server seemed like a nice guy. There were no napkins/silverware on our table when we sat down and it proceeded that way until the food came out. Even then we had to ask for silverware before our server finally brought some out. We had ordered wine, which we never got but were still charged for! There was a fruit fly buzzing over our food during the entire time we were there! The table next to us was dirty from the moment we were seated till we left about an hour later. I understand that it was almost closing time but that's no excuse to be so sloppy.

There's better Indian food to be had in the city."}
{"text":"I love indian food but have never gone to a South Indian restaurant so a friend and myself tried it out. Everything was great - food and service. Since we weren't completely familiar with the menu our server helped us out a great deal. Although when we were ready to leave it took a while for us to get the server's attention again to grab the bill, we were happy that we got to sit a bit longer. As many people have said their dosas are great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My only criteria is the food and I just ate one of the best masala dosas I've had in a long time. IMHO an essential aspect of a masala dosa is the sambar and coconut chutney, which they do very well (far better than Saravana Bhavan). Rather than the lazy, watery sambar that has heat but no depth (I'm looking at you SB), the sambar at Madras Masala has rich flavour depth and just the right amount of heat. Same goes for the coconut chutney. We also had the Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani, which was great."}
{"text":"Best dosa place in Toronto. It tastes authentic, with actual flavor and spice, unlike a lot of other dosa places that try to cater to the western palate."}
{"text":"Best biriyani I've had in Toronto...and I've tried many! Overall excellent food and reasonable prices. Must haves - hyderabadi dum biriyani, gobi manchurian, mango lassi, kulfi . Dosas are good too. Love the waiters who are friendly and knowledgeable in terms of giving food recommendations. This has become a weekly spot for us. Oh and I much prefer it to the neighbouring Banjara."}
{"text":"Had a meal delivered which was not good however I think they were having a bad day as Madras Masala has always been very good previously.  Their customer service when we complained was excellent so based on this and past good experiences will definitely give them a second chance.  I have eaten here lots of times before and have always had a delicious food."}
{"text":"Thirst for pipping hot idli ended here. Small compact place with good South Indian food. Not very expensive and very accessible too as it's near to TTC Christie. We tried Idli , Mysore masala , butter milk and coffee. All was good in taste and enjoyed a bite."}
{"text":"By far the best South Indian food.  Lamb xacutti is outstanding.   Dosi with potatoes!!!  Appetizers were good across the board.
Much better than it's next door cousin whose northern Indian cuisine can easily be bought in a jar and prepared at home."}
{"text":"Monster-sized dosas!!!

We were on the hunt for a place for dosa around the downtown core as we were surprised that there weren't any within a short walking distance from the University Avenue. As we ventured further west on Bloor - a friend recommended as this was THE place to go for dosa so we couldn't resist!

The plaza is bit oddly located as there is actually 2 restaurants in the same building with a couple of parking spots. The restaurant does have a large outdoor seating area which is great for a summer time dinner. They even managed to fit our huge group of 12 people together.

As a group, we ordered a slew of mouth watering appetizers that included medhu vada, idly, pani puri. Having never had pani puri - I wasn't sure what to expect as it was a combo of crispy shell with a chickpea sauce. But after the first bite - I was sold on it and immediately had another one :).

For our individual meals, I ordered the mysore masala dosa where I wasn't sure if was enough. Based on my prior dosa experiences, I thought it was going to be small - boy - I was wrong. The waiter brought out an enormous dosa folded in a triangle that covered the entire metal tray. The dosa are also served with sambar and chutney. The dosa was super crispy with tasty potato filling. Not spicy at all unless you dipped it in to hot sauce. A few others ordered their gunpowder and chili cheese which was much spicier! This has certainly raised my dosa experience by a whole new level - if you have never had dosa before - Madras Masala is the place to try it!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I live in the neighbourhood but had never tried this place before tonight.  Quick service, HUGE portions (shared my cheesy masala dosa and there were still leftovers) and very, very good.  It's too bad the outdoor patio looks out onto the parking lot, but otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"As all the other reviews have mentioned this place makes good dosas. I am from Madras and have grown up eating dosas at restaurants in India. To me, a good dosa experience is when the dosa taste good and when the dosa has the right crispiness in it. Madras Masala delivered on both fronts. We really enjoyed our food. The chutney and sambhar that comes along with the dosa were very authentic tasting.

We had two kids with us so we ordered some parathas for them. We were pleasantly surprised how good the parathas tasted. I ended up ordering one for myself after I had gobbled up my dosa.

The only disappointments were:
1) Appetizers - Vada and bajjis were not up to the mark. Did not taste fresh.
2) Dosas are enjoyed hot. Unfortunately it looked like they waited for all dosas in our order to be ready to bring them out together. My dosa was partly cold when it arrived. 
3) The place is pretty small and on a cold winter day when we decided to go there, the place was not well heated. To add to that they gave us a table right at the door. We had to have our jackets on through out our meal. The already cold dosa that was given to us had to be consumed pretty quickly because it was getting really cold really fast."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place as I was craving a dosa. She got the butter chicken with naan. 
I got the cheese dosa and I was quite impressed with it. The naan was amazing however a little too oily. When it came to the butter chicken - I really thought they could have done better. It was a little too sweet and very 'whipping creamish'
For desert, I tried the rava kesari which was ok. The masala tea was alright as well but not as good as the places on Gerard st. 
The service was absolutely fantastic and the servers were really kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Sorry guys  if you need upset stomach then go here.  Doaa full of baking soda.  Masala was very spicy."}
{"text":"Dosa and spicy chai is the world's best combination on a cold breezy day. Madras Masala is as good as dosa gets (at least before I visit a dosa street vendor in South India). If Yogi Bear lives in Christie Pits, instead of \"pic-a-nic baskets\", he would be at Madras Masala, devouring gigantic dosas! 

My friends and I shared the cheese mysore masala dosa, paper masala dose, and rava dosa at Madras Masala! Each dosa came with coconut chutney, tomato coconut chutney and sambar. The cooling sensation of coconut chutney complimented the warming spices perfectly. 

The SPL rava dosa ($10.99) is embedded with crispy caramelized onions in the batter of semolina and rice flour. The sweetness from onion balanced the savoriness of the potato masala. The crunchy exterior juxtapose the soft interior. 

The cheese mysore masala dosa ($10.99) resembles grilled cheese, expect this Indian grilled cheese is stuffed with masala potatoes and onions. If potatoes and grilled cheese had a love child in India, it would be cheese mysore masala dosa! 

The paper masala dosa ($11.99) stuffed with potato masala, is the size of my torso! That dish alone is enough to feed a small army! Typically, the aromatic potato is mixed with 10 to 12 different  herbs and spices! 

The complex flavors oscillate between sweet and savory; spicy and fresh, pungent and fragrant. Dosa is an interplay of earth's bounty. Dosa is the synthesis of divinity!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went there before she left for India. The food here was perfect! We went to another place a few days later and it definitely didn't compare to here. I liked that the atmosphere was calm and it felt quite like home to me. 

First we had the idli with some sambar and coconut and onion chutneys, then we each had a masala dosa with the same sambar and chuteys, and we finished with some cardamon kulfi. 

We ate everything so quickly that we forgot to take a picture, but we did get a picture of the kulfi. It was so good."}
{"text":"Customer service was good the guy was friendly and very professional. 
The food was not that great the dosa was not crispy as I expected. 
Still not bad for dosa as it is located in downtown and easily accessible. 
The coffee was good, perfect filter coffee."}
{"text":"We sat outside - the space is a little awkward in regards to set-up (I think others have mentioned that it used to be a doughnut shop).  We ordered two dishes & an order of rice.  The portion size didn't match up with the prices.  The food didn't stand out to me as anything special & I wouldn't choose to return."}
{"text":"This review reflects a change in management/ownership. To start with we have been dedicated customers of Madras Masala for many years, from when they first opened. Because it was a cold and wet night we were craving some of their really yummy dhosas. From the minute we entered the reception was less than friendly. Gone are the young friendly waiters, who knew how to serve, replaced by a couple of young woman who just didn't care about their customers. Instead ensuring basic customer service they spent the majority of their time fussing over their children. While we were disappointed by the service we hoped for the same quality of food. Sadly, the food also has changed for the worse. The dhosas are now a pale imitation of what they once served. Gone are the crisp finished edges replaced with a mushy, wet exterior showing that the lack of attention. The potato and onion interior was also a mushy mess replacing the original chunks of potato and onions. We asked if the place had changed hands and were told in less than friendly way, that yes it was under new management. A note to the new owners/managers if you want to survive in Toronto's cutthroat restaurant market, the quality of your food and service is paramount. If nothing changes I would not be surprised to see the place shuttered."}
{"text":"The place is just fine. I had uttapam and medu vada here.
I sat outside on a wobbly table. Service was kind of slow for everything, taking order, serving and getting the check.
Uttapam tasted fine but the chutneys could have been better."}
{"text":"The food was pretty much as expected. We ordered podi masala dosa and rava dosa. Rova dosa tasted really nice just that it was very oily. Podi masala dosa's masala was really bland. the red chutney is very tasty though. Service is a little sloppy as we had to ask for napkins and cutlery even after waiting for sometime after the food was served."}
{"text":"Order two Dosas to go last night - so tasty and well done!  Mmm... My partner and I ordered the Masala Dosa ($7.99 each).  Came with Sambar lentil soup, which was vegetarian/vegan (I\"m veg), but pretty salty...  The two chutneys that they included were nice, went well with the dosa.  I kind of wish they had a Tamarind-based sauce, as well...  My partner also ordered Garlic Naan bread with a chicken curry.  Came with pappadums, that tasted \"okay\".  He was supposed to save it as a meal for the next day, but I suspect that the food was so tasty (despite having A LOT of visible oil),  that he ended up eating the whole thing - right after polishing off his dosa meal !  The Garlic Naan was a powerhouse of garlic.  I've never had that much garlic on a naan before.  \"Where's the naan?\" my partner joked.  

The dosas were so good, I'd love to go back today even, for seconds.  No question that we'll be back.  :)

Food arrived in less than the quoted 15 min.  

Place was packed.  I'd recommend RSVPing.

** There will be a Dosa Festival there!  Mon-Thurs. throughout this July and August."}
{"text":"I recently shared a dosa as big as my thigh with a pal here and it was one of the best meals I've had in a while. The menu has dosas by the dozen, but again I point to my thigh and warn you that these bad boys are for sharing!  

Definitely my place to get curried away in the west end. 

PEPPER POINTS: I can't say enough about this staff. They are professional yet fun and super sweet."}
{"text":"The service is not good. Do NOT order Biriyani here. It's garbage. 

Dosa and other stuff are ok."}
{"text":"I don't have to go all the way to Mississauga/Brampton for delicious dosa anymore? And they serve beer?? And they have a patio??? 100% COUNT ME IN!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely deserving of the great reviews. We're visiting from Los Angeles and sought out these dosas.

The store front is a little cramped, but the food and service were excellent. We had the Chili Masala Dosa and the Channa Batura. Both were extremely generously sized and tasted great. Straight up dosa flavors and tastes here, no Americanized stuff. They also offer some North Indian options and Indo-Chinese options.

Looking around the restaurant some others had thalis providing them a variety of dishes to enjoy. I'm getting the thali next time!"}
