{"text":"Went on a Saturday night got seated right away. There are 15 tables total, good wine and beer selection. We both got the Mac n cheese- I got the Grecian, amazingly delicious. Had spinach, Kalamata olives, roasted garlic, basil and feta. Gooey inside and crispy at the top. Excellent service. The server even gave us a small desert sample of a peanut crunch and Italian cookies. The cash only option was not a big deal- totally worth it! Can't wait to go back. We live right around the corner. The decor inside is beautiful and well thought out."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid. First the food, the Mac n Cheese was clumpy and clearly had to much roux. The artichoke dip was grainy, tasted like it had been frozen at some point. The decor looks like something out of an eighties grandmothers apartment. I tried it simply because it was in my neighborhood and was hoping to support it. The menu has no continuity. Maybe this place would do ok in a non-descript suburb, but with the gems that Ohio city has to offer, there is no place for mediocrity. On top of the fact, this is 2014, people have refined palates and watch what they eat...seriously, Mac n cheese followed by cake? And the name, oy...sounds like a name a 7 year old would give to their pretend restaurant... I won't say much about the cash only thing except that it's of course their choice, but when you don't have to worry about how much cash you have, you don't typically give too much thought to how much wine or anything else you order. Bad business move, but great way to limit what their customers will order."}
{"text":"Meh.    I walked in the door hoping to really love this place.  The atmosphere is nice, not my style, but nice.  We were quickly seated and reminded that they only accept cash.  Thanks for the reminder, but why?  I happen to be a cash only type of guy, but I am in a small minority.  If you must, adjust your food prices to offset the 5%.    I ordered a beer, only to be told they where out.  It was a bit annoying to me because it was the only beer that looked kind of good.  Ordered a coke instead.  Baked Brie appetizer was fantastic, period.  I ordered krazy Mac, and thought it to be just good.  My wife ordered the meatloaf and said it was great.    Total bill was 54$ ish. Left $70 total and thought to myself; was this meal worth $70?    Sadly, the answer is no."}
{"text":"****OUT OF BUSINESS****  This place was SO good! The interior is cozy and the service was excellent. We started with the artichoke and pita appetizer, and it was delicious. The bread that came with the meal was a definite highlight and tasted fresh. I had the pasta with vegetables and my picky friend had the pork, and we both were members of the clean plate club. The entrees come with a salad so it is more than enough food.  The place is new, so there were a couple of kinks (white wine in a red wine glass, lights could be a bit dimmer) but the staff was kind and accommodating. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great meal!  We both had different Mac & Cheese dishes and both were fantastic.  We stayed away from the pastries, but from what we saw, they looked great!    A great addition to Ohio City!!"}
{"text":"I always love when a new place opens in my neighborhood and cannot wait to try it out.    I was a bit concerned about the cash only policy, only because I like to go into a place and order what I want and not worry if I will have enough money to pay for it at the end of the night. Also living so close and knowing I'll be walking, I don't exactly feel safe carrying a wad of cash in this neighborhood. So was very happy to find out that they DO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS now!   I also wasn't thrilled about the fact of paying $16- $18 for a plate of mac and cheese. So I was really happy when we walked in on a Tuesday and found out it was 1/2 off mac and cheese night.  The decor is cozy and quaint. Service very attentive and friendly.    We ordered drinks (wine and beer), decent selection and served promptly. After we ordered our meals, we were served with bread and butter.The bread was served in a paper bag. It was so good; very warm and fresh and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch.  We started with a side salad ($3 on 1/2 off night). The salads were a very good portion.  It had three types of mixed greens, croutons, red onion, shredded carrots, a grape tomato and a cucumber slice. I had mine with the house french dressing (predominate flavors: onion and garlic). It was creamy and tasted very good. My boyfriend ordered his salad with a house vinaigrette. He liked it, I thought it was okay, just oil and vinegar- nothing special.  Next came our meals. I ordered the South Beach Mac (sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, roasted garlic, caramelized fennel and feta cheese). It had good flavors, but thought it to be a little bland unless your bite included some of the feta or sun dried tomato.  Think it could have used a little salt. My boyfriend ordered the Southwestern Mac (cheddar and pepper jack, chorizo, peppers, black beans and red pepper cheese sauce). His dish also was very good.  Although he also felt it to be a little bland unless a bit of chorizo was in the bite. I didn't agree with him, I thought the red pepper cheese sauce gave it a mild kick. He was just looking for something spicier. But he did say it was very cheesy and the peppers were cooked to perfection.  We ended our night with a miniature Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. It was okay. It tasted just like Key Lime Pie, but I didn't really taste the cheesecake part. Since cheesecake is my favorite desert and I make really good cheesecake myself, I wasn't really all that impressed.   You do get a healthy portion of food here and we ended up taking a good amount of mac and cheese home. We both ate our left overs 2 days later and felt that the flavors had a chance to incorporate and tasted much better.  I still think $16-18 is a bit much for mac and cheese, but I will definitely be back to try the other dishes on half off night.  I recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"An amazing addition to the Ohio City Restaurant scene, and I love that it's located in the middle of our neighborhood!  We got the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese to split, but can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  The food was great, the wine was delicious, and the staff was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"10 of us went here last night to celebrate 2 birthdays, it was the first time for all of us.  The food was excellent, so was the service.  The chocolate truffle dessert is fantastic, light and rich.  Oh, and they now take credit cards.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but way on the rich side. At least the Mac and cheeses come with a salad to start. But 18 dollars for some Mac is quite expensive. Their dessert selection was extremely light on the baked goods considering the name of the place, so we opted for a chocolate gelato which was good, but inaccurately described to us.   Service was good other than that. Just a bit on the expensive side for that kind of food in my opinion, but they did a good job on it, it was tasty. My friend did thoroughly enjoy that they had a more rare Wisconsin beer available, horny goat. One of her favorites!"}
