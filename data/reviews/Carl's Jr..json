{"text":"Absolute SLOWEST food service ive ever visited. They're consistently slow to a point of just plain silly"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. Twice I had to remind them that they hadn't taken my money after they gave me my food. Once they were out of catsup? These were all in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat late at night. They had one lady do both the drive thru and inside register. She was way to slow to being doing both and management had no sense give her help. Waited at drive thru for 15 minutes before they took the order of car in front of us and that car finally drove off. That place needs new management. I think everyone that works there didn't graduate High School."}
{"text":"Glad to have this new CJ in my area. Every time we visit the employees are so nice and interact with my daughter.  Love Carl's Jr. They need to bring back the turkey club. The breakfast biscuit sandwiches are so good."}
{"text":"I can't believe I keep getting tricked into eating here. Their advertising money is well spent it draws me in time and time again. I ordered the famous star special and there was nothing special about it. The hockey puck burger patty mixed with the wilted veggies just did not work. Two stars is being generous."}
{"text":"The chili cheese fries tastes like dog food..shoulda went to Jack in the Box next door. Save your money, the chili cheese fries were crap..and the meat looks like something you find in dog food cans."}
{"text":"Good service, food is fast and you can not beat a company that offers military discount. They always get my repeat business.  I suggest the super star with cheese."}
{"text":"Got the burger with the onion rings and bbq sauce. And fries. It was slathered in sauce and ketchup. I hate ketchup. Fine my fault lets try the burger... aaaand... tastes like a grocery store frozen burger. I can tell it was cooked a while back and is just held at a temp. Definitely not fresh. Weird fake seasoning.  Fries were ok, but the oil tastes funny. Not dirty, just funny. Bun was good. Place looks pretty and the cashier was really nice therefore 2 stars not 1."}
{"text":"I came to the Carl's Jr. that resides on 8660 w warmsprings right across from Bank of America on May, 24 around 645pm and was helped by shift lead I believe, not once did he smile and when the food was ready he simply brought our trays to our table and did not breathe a word. Normally I can let it slide and go on with my day but to make matters worst the food was a mess as if it made in a hurry if you are in search of a carl jr. with decent taste I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here is what you would expect... It's fast food. Consistent and ok. However the staff it's almost always an awful experience.   Takes forever to order because of the language difficulty and it seems they are always new. Their trying but just not acceptable. Many times you don't get what you wanted and have to go back and straighten it out."}
{"text":"So, so bad. I knew what I was getting into I don't expect fast food to be gourmet. It was terrible though. The food tasted like it had been sitting a long time. I wish I had gotten a picture of my dad's burger before he suddenly got up and threw it away. It was flat like a pancake. It was old and stale. He ate exactly 3 bites and could eat no more. I had a chicken sandwich, the chicken was actually not terrible for being fast food, but my bun was stale and there just too many flavors going on. I am not sure they made it correctly. It was odd. The lettuce on it was the white thick part down by the end of the head. I didn't realize iceberg could be so bad. Then there was the heat. It felt like the heater was on in there and the entire restaurant smelled like dirty feet."}
{"text":"If you haven't downloaded their mobile app, do it now. I got a free big chicken fillet sandwich. It was the first time I had tried their chicken sandwich. I also ordered fries and went through the drive thru. I ate the fries right away. They were just warm, so not all that great. I ate the chicken sandwich when I got home. It was still warm, so I'm assuming hot when I first got it. The chicken fillet sandwich was one of the best I've had from a fast food restaurant. I took off the top part of the bun, because it was way to much bread for me. Fresh lettuce and tomato was on it, with a very small amount of mayo. Just how I like it. I would have given a 5 if it wasn't for the fries."}
{"text":"Food is always soggy. Almost as if it was warmed up in a bowl of water. The lettuce is disgusting. The tomatoes are gross. The foods thrown together like ray Charles made it. I thought burger king was bad. This is pretty much the same.  The drinks are okay I guess."}
{"text":"Sorry to Carl's Jr but this place was disgusting and a disgrace. I felt gross being served from this place and that's without even mentioning the drink counter.  There were old cups all over the counter, soda spilled, no napkins, Lisa and pretty much everything. The floor had dirty lids and a ketchup packet. The other trash can, \"the clean one\" was full to the brim. The table were in disarray, some with chairs and others looking like people left bits of chewed food around. I don't eat CJ often but after today and these ridiculous prices...$12 for bacon western??....I won't be back and I'll be sure to share my experience with everyone I know. I wish y'all luck as a business card it's gonna be needed I wish I could show the pictures I have, just bad.  Feel free to contact me at: Scuillerk@gmail.com"}
{"text":"In the area on training and stopped in. The bathroom was urine soaked and smelled horrible! The tables were sticky, and the server has no professional manners. I thanked him twice and he just grunted both times.  The manager has some work cut out for them at this location...."}
{"text":"This Carls Jr is the worst after 8pm. I mean you're guys are open until 1:30 am. I didn't get any service at the drive thru at like 12:30am. Staff is not the friendliest. I know it's just fast food but that just ridiculous. It happened more than once!"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. is awesome customer service is top of the line they let me warm up my food in their microwave . A customer who isn't buying anything 5 stars for them"}
{"text":"They would be better if they could simply know how to read. I don't know if you can help stupid. The menu isn't that hard to make. The screen is in front of their faces and reads any alterations to anything on the menu. They just simply FAIL!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, the issue is with the soda dispenser. The ice cubes are literally dirty, you can see the dirt inside the ice. After complaining to management, I got a refund for my food, but then refused to bring me the food I ordered. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Disgusting!! Bad staff! I asked to add coke and got diet coke instead... so I came back... The young woman with the name Elaine on the name tag handed me the coke and said: \"Are you happy now beach?\" I was shocked! I asked for the manager.... no manager... so I asked for her full name... I received a \"faked\" name: \"Mariah\" ... it looks like they work as a team to protect one another... they removed their name tags! Then, the young woman Elaine came back to the window with a different weird name tag... with a changed name on it : \"Mariah\" / What is going on here?... are they so afraid that I'll complain?... I turned around with my car to get inside the store but I saw Elaine running fast to lock it. Instead of being polite and apologize for the mistake... they waisted my time and other clients time as well. I will call the management right after the weekend and will see how this will be handled. I may as well go to the press!! The food wasn't good either... the fries were burned and the Hamburger a bit of a mess. Don't go there... you'll be disappointed! It all happened at 4:30pm on Saturday (June 25th)"}
{"text":"Spent $10 on my meal which was chicken sandwich, fries, and a milkshake.  C'mon!  For fast food?  And my food was cold & tasteless."}
{"text":"Fast food what a joke, friendly service NOT !!!!!! I will never go back to this one even though it is super close. I have been there several times . You need new employees. Food took way toooooooo long."}
{"text":"I was really feeling the western bacon cheesburger vibe in the morning so I went over here in the morning for that for breakfast. I went through the drive-thru. Only problem I had was that it seemed to take long, maybe 10 minutes, for my order. I think the person was the manager, or morning manager if they have different people, and he was all alone (btw he looks like the air marshall from Bridesmaids). I'm not sure if it was slow because he was the only one there, or maybe I had ordered something that was typically for lunch or dinner and not for breakfast, both those issues, or something else...or maybe they just take a long time.  The location is pretty bad. I'm speaking purely from a traffic point of view. Good luck getting out of there...or in there for that matter. Not that it's hard but traffic in the morning around 6:30 right there is pretty bad...and I imagine it doesn't lighten up with the 202 being right there. The asphalt is in poor shape too."}
{"text":"Bought a western bacon cheeseburger and it looked like someone stepped on my burger. 4  dollars is what i paid for that sandwhich and it was a insult. Look at the picture please."}
{"text":"They are open on Sundays even though yelp says they aren't. They have good service! My dad ordered a famous star and it was made incorrectly so he took it back and they have him a new sandwich no questions asked."}
{"text":"Horrible, nasty dry frys an chicken strips that look like chicken nuggets an were extremely dry.. I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and fries here on a Friday night after spending 30 minutes at the bar across the street and not seeing a single car pull in.  The burger was cold and hard. I was their only customer for ~30ish minutes and the pieces of **** inside couldn't be bothered to cook a new patty. Never. Again."}
{"text":"So I usually love this Carl's, the food is always great and fresh and the employees at incredibly friendly. However, I always order the low carb six dollar guacamole bacon burger (say that 3x fast! ) and sometimes, understandably, its hard for the people in the drive-thru to catch all of what I'm saying. So I say it slow and they repeat it back to me to make sure they got it right.  There's a couple employees who get it right, but it seems like there's always some issue. Either I'm charged for a low carb burger and I get one with a bun (which is fine because the LC is cheaper and I just take off the bun) or, like tonight, there is no guacamole or bacon. This is already after they initially forgot the LC part and I had to say the whole thing over again.  Not really complaining because this burger is comfort food for me regardless, and I guess people don't order these burgers very often,  its just a pet peeve. But everything else here is stellar for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever! I was the only car and it literally took 20 mins to order. Then 15 mins to pay and get my food. It's happened to me twice already.. Very upsetting!"}
{"text":"I ordered a famous star and specifically said no pickles and no cheese. Okay they got the pickles right, but they put cheese on it. And they forgot the onions. And they forgot the sauce. Really... They dont seem to know how to make their own food."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. Crew has managed to screw up our order twice in a row. The first time we went there, my fiancé specifically told them no pickles and no lettuce on his burger. The girl who took our order even confirmed what he said but lo and behold, there was both lettuce AND pickles on the burger when we got home!  That's not even the worst mess up--the worst mess up was tonight when I ordered a Charbroiled Alaskan Cod sandwich and came home to find out I got a Superstar burger instead. WTF!?"}
{"text":"We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place. Not sure why it is not highly rated. Went in on a Monday, they had a two for one special on select burgers. I got the super? burger with cheese and onion and their special sauce and it was really good. The burger was a good size and really substantial. The ingredients were pretty fresh for a fast food place and I loved the sauce. The patty had that charbroiled taste which was good. It wasn't particularly juicy but not dry either. The place is huge and I had no trouble with ordering or service. Food was quick I waited like two minutes. I didn't try anything else this time but I would come back for their burgers."}
{"text":"I like Carl's Jr, that's why I'm giving two stars. But as we were eating here at this location an exterminator came in and started spraying in the lobby WHILE WE WERE EATING! Then they went to the back, where the food is made, and started spraying back there! I'm aware businesses in the food industry have to exterminate, but really? While we're eating?! The last thing you want to think about when you're eating is roaches in the kitchen, or chemicals settling in your food!! I'd recommend they wait till closing to do that."}
{"text":"SERVICE HORRIBLE at this location. A teenage know it all actually rolled his eyes at me & argued with me in front of a manager - think more like a shift supervisor - who could care less about a complaint. This kid was SO unbelievably rude over the drive thru speaker, that I actually backed my car out of the drive thru, parked & went inside to talk to a manager, or lack thereof. Usually I do not have the energy or time to complain about the bad service of our food industry these days, but this was bad enough I acutally called the corporate office. I will say at least the corporate office seemed interested in my opinion. I would go to another Carl's Jr because corporate seemed to care but definately not to this location on 55th & Northern again...never have I seen someone in a service position be SO rude & irrogant... get a different job - one that doesn't involve people... if you hate your job so bad!"}
{"text":"I gotta say of all the fast food in cave creek, Carl's jr has been by far the best. Only issue I have is that I ordered 1 double western bacon cheeseburger for $ 4.50 and just a western bacon cheeseburger (only has one patty) for 3.99. Then I ordered 2 medium French fries for 2.50 each. How is it that 2 medium fries are 5.00 and the double western burger is only 4.50. Then, there's only .50 cents more for another patty?? Either way, French fries are wayyyyyy to expensive! 2.50 seriously?? Total was 15.00 for fries and hamburgers. No, sodas. Ridiculous.  Hamburgers were great however as always but then we totally also got shorted on the French fries. Like we were there at 7 and they didn't wanna make more so they evenly distributed whatever they had left so I paid 5.00 bucks for basically 1 fry.  Wanna come back but feel ripped off."}
{"text":"If I could give these a 00000 I would .  I would not feed this food to my dogs... Disgusting .... Horrible... I spent 7.00 and literally when I opened it through it right in the trash can... Do not ever eat here"}
{"text":"GREAT FOR KIDS!  The indoor play area is HUGE!  My kids love going here, and the menu is amazing for a fast food joint.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"SLOW!  Sat in the drive through no cars ahead none behind for 16 minutes.  All I ordered was a grilled Santa Fe style chicken sandwich.  I rarely go to this location because of the wait.  How ever 16 minutes is FAR to long for one sandwich.  I live 2-3 minutes from this location and when I got home the bun was all soggy.  Seems a bit fast to me for the bun to be all soggy.  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Finally a location in the area. Love the famous star, super star and the steakhouse six dollar burger. Also the charbroiled sante fe chicken sandwich. Drive thru is open 24hrs. Didn't eat inside just went drive thru but it looked kinda busy inside. Drive thru service was quick."}
{"text":"Came to this Carl's Jr for a quick lunch. It's not in the best part of town but I figured I could get a bite to eat without a problem... I was wrong. I ordered a hamburger and fries and asked for a cup for water. The cashier reacted as if I had just pulled a gun. He started getting nervous and said that he can't give me a water cup because it \"causes too many problems.\" I had no idea what he was talking about. He said people \"steal\" soda so they don't give out water cups. He said that I can buy a cup or fill up my own cup if I happened to have one in my back pocket. I asked for the manager and he lowered his voice and whispered that he could give me a kids cup. Pretty hilarious. Only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of one is because the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Ate inside on our way from Vegas to Reno. Service was better than most actual sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"They gave me a southwest burger with no meat. None. How in the world do you make a burger, in which other items, like cheese, jalapenos, etc are loaded on to a meat patty, with out the meat patty? It was not busy at all.  One car behind me well after I ordered. No one at the counter which you can see from the drive thru.  I only get \"fast\" food when I need something fast. So now, I don't have time to drive back. Nice. When I called, I did not even get an \"I'm sorry\".  What a joke.  With so many fast food places around and their drive thru usually empty (even on a busy corne)r, you'd think they'd have at least some intelligence.  I guess other people knew what I didn't.   And if you go there for a burrito, you will pay over twice as much as you would at Taco Bell, which is one street over on Dobson. Their prices are high, their service horrible, and their food incomplete."}
{"text":"The gentleman that helped me in the drive thru the day I went was amazing. He was super nice and he even had great up-selling skills. Definitely going back to this one."}
{"text":"This used to be my preferred location for a quick breakfast.  My previous visit I ordered the grilled cheese breakfast sandwich to go.  When I arrived at work I found a sandwich with a couple of pieces of barely warm bread slopped over with some butter like goo. Not grilled, just sopping.  The cheese was cold and unmelted.  My most recent visit I ordered chicken strips and was told very snidely that \"I don't serve those until after 10:30\".  I had previously been assured that the full menu was available but it's not. I opted for a grilled chicken salad instead.  Got to work, brown salad under the top layer. It was obviously old.   I contacted corporate and did get a prompt response which was apologetic and promised a coupon for a replacement salad. It's now been two weeks. I'm not holding my breath.  There appears to have been a management change. The gentleman that ran it so well has't been there of late and the current staff has an attitude about serving you.  The ones that speak English anyway.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cold food and dried out, tasted like the burger and been in the warming tray for hours.  $8 for a fast food burger and fries was outrageous."}
{"text":"I asked for a big cheese burger at the drive through. Went through got burger no cheese on it. Went back through said you forgot to put cheese on. Brandi Said no it doesn't come with cheese so I can add cheese to it but I got to charge 50 cents more. I said well I asked for a big cheeseburger do you remember that. She said yes she remembered. No apology for wasting my time. Instead she gave me a frown. I said you should have charged me correctly the first time so why don't you just fix it. She seemed pissed and asked for the other burger back and told the cook to make another burger. I shouldn't have had to twist her arm to get her to do this for when she got the order wrong in the first place. That kinda service keeps people away. I'm regretting I voted to pay minimum wage people more money."}
{"text":"Good customer service. But this place needs a good cleaning. Especially the restroom. It was filthy. Fecal matter smeared in the walls. It was not new either. Toilet paper and seat covers all over the floor. Dirty toilets and sink."}
{"text":"I was very hungry and decided to try this place for lunch. I have been to Hardees in the USA, but never Carl's Jr., same thing so whatever. As I walk in two ladies looking at the menu decide to go to A&W instead. There you go Yelp, women are smarter than men.  I got the classic thickburger combo. The fries were alright and they do give you a lot. I am though noticing a trend with places like this and Five Guys to give a lot of fries to mask over their average burgers.  As for the thickburger it was pretty awful. The burger patty was dry and tasted like a frozen PC patty. There was far too much mayo which had my burger sliding out of the bun.  The reason I rate this place so low is how the burger made me feel after. I felt terrible and was sluggish for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Lost my order and then made it wrong. Manager was a bitch and could barely speak English."}
{"text":"I went in to order food with my children.  As we're waiting for our order I look over and see two of the cook and another employee hugging being the counter in plain view then the female employee touches the male cook butt.  It was very inappropriate and my children saw what was going on.  I will never go back to that establishment unless they rectify the situation.  So unacceptable."}
{"text":"Today we has a wonderful experience at this Carl's Jr. Julia our cashier was awesome. She kept checking g on us. She was so courteous . It's nice to know there are still nice fast food workers out there. Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had. I was making my order and she totaled it before I was done. Ummm no!!! Look here, learn how to listen and take orders. She said she couldn't hear me but I was already pretty much yelling into the speaker box. train your employees better!!!"}
{"text":"They ran out of fresh baked buns and substituted standard buns instead, which apparently cost more.  I can't complain too much though, it's a Carl's Jr. What can one really expect?"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They would not let us order a cheese burger because they ran out of buns. They had large buns but could not use them for a cheese burger. We had to negotiate and pay $.79 more for a larger bun ( my 7 year old just wanted a cheese burger). Besides that issue the service was slow we watched to employees talk for several minutes before they acknowledged us, and when we got our burgers we had to remind them that we needed drinks."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. is Carl's Jr.  The food is what it is.  My review is on the manager Greg.  I have been here twice which is 2 more times than I have been to a Carl's Jr. in the last 3 years.  First visit Greg the manager went out of his way to make sure my wife, son, and I had everything we needed and were enjoying our meal.  He noticed that my son who is a special needs child was making a mess so he made us a bib for my son to wear which was thoughtful and came over and chatted for a minute and got my son laughing.  Today I went back by myself and once again Greg went out of his way to make sure everything was good with me as well as the other customers.  It is obvious he actually cares about his work and ensuring all the guests are pleased with their meal.    Normally I would not waste my time reviewing a fast food joint unless the place was horrible but sometimes you have to spend a little time providing recognition on a person like Greg that obviously makes this place more than just a Carl's Jr.  You can tell he would be a man of his word."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location later on in the evening and night. 40 minutes stuck in a drive thru line and then asked to order at window for another 20. And, of course left items out of the order. Horrible horrible service."}
{"text":"I hate writing reviews but this place is a mess ! Employees take their jobs as a joke . I ordered a chicken sandwich with Swiss  cheese and insead of cheese they put a lot of mayo and tried making me believe it was cheese when I tried it and it was nothing but mayo and they laughed in my face and took out the mayo and put a slice of cheese, smh people need to be serious about their job"}
{"text":"There are few things that annoy me more than when I hit the drive through...get home starving and ready to eat.... only to discover that my order was completely messed up. This has happened almost every time I've been to this location. My fave thing on the menu is the teriyaki turkey burger. Each time I order it I stress that I do NOT want mayo. The response is always the same \"mayo doesn't come on that sandwich\". Then when I get home and unwrap my meal I find loads of mayo on it. When people say they don't want mayo.... it's because they can't stand that disgusting lard and any trace of it will completely ruin their meal!   So make sure you check that your order was done correctly before driving home. On a good note.... A+ for cleanliness and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"this is my go to spot after a concert. for what it is, it deserves the 5 stars. you should already know what to expect when you come to a fast food place. the good thing about this location is that it's open 24 hours and most importantly has never failed me during late night trips. the coke always tastes amazing, my order is always right which actually says a lot because it's typically a complicated order with several additions and substitutions... AND the food is prepared after I order it and comes out hot and 'fresh'. the late night staff is always very polite which is great, because like I said, my Carl's Jr orders are usually complicated and picky."}
{"text":"Slow ass drive through seriously l, poor service , poor management have the car park in the parking to get their food the place is empty and it takes 10 min just to get service"}
{"text":"2 people working during lunch hrs???.. Over 20 minutes wait with only 1 person in line ahead of me.... Fast Food FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"I usually give fast food employees the benefit of the doubt, maybe in part because I've worked in fast food before, but the service at this location is exceptionally bad as far as how long it takes the employees to get me my food when I'm the only one waiting there for anything. I always seem to be standing around for a good 10 minutes while they don't quite do their jobs. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Carls jr, the food taste great, but what happened today was absolutely unacceptable. I pulled up to this locations drive thru and was told by the girl that it would be awhile with no explanation. i waited in line for 13 minutes before anyone even asked to take my order. I then decided to back out and leave (forcing the other 3 cars in line to back out as well). Do better carls jr"}
{"text":"I went in at about 4:30 this morning to pick up a couple of Double Western Bacon Cheeseburgers to go.  That's what I asked for, that's what the guy repeated to me and charged me for, and that's how they were labeled on the wrapper.  When I got them home, they were single Western Bacon Cheeseburgers.  Looks like these folks need watching."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review ever. I've given this Carl's Jr. three chances. All three chances they've screwed up my order. My favorite item to order is the teriyaki burger which comes with white cheese. I've received it twice with American cheese and by the third time I just reminded them that it doesn't come with American cheese before they made it. That time they got it right but screwed up my boyfriend's burger. Ugh! Not to mention the terrible customer service. They are never apologetic when they mess up and every time I've gone through the drive thru the cashier hands me my bag, says nothing, and closes the small window. Umm? Very rude. Now I drive an extra 20 min to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Took literally 45 minutes in the drive thru to get my food with no apology for the delay. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I came into this establishment on Monday after many years of not coming and the cashier was so rude and the food was cold and the buns were hard. We asked for manager and she wasn't any more polite than the cashier. I explained to her the importance of good customer service , but she could care less. This is not an establishment that I would return to and if the lobby  was any indication neither are other people. I am an office manager and I would be cringing at the thought of losing a customer . The food was cold but that could have been remade the attitudes cannot.       sincerely ,tammy 602-373-9853"}
{"text":"They no longer accept Printed Coupons per PM shift 5/13/17 manager. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST cheeseburger I've ever been served in my life! See the photo. Zero stars.  Seems like every other hamburger place puts an 800 number or a link to their website so you can comment on the food/service. Not this place. Now I know what they are afraid of hearing/seeing."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr is may favorite fast food burger, it has a good grill flavor not like BK which to me taste like liquid smoke.  They have a hearty low carb burger that taste great and fills me up.       They also have interesting featured burgers . The staff brings the food to you when dining in and clears your tray when your done , they always check to see if everything alright."}
{"text":"Luv the fact that u can make any burger low carb.  I like the six dollar burger  it's 1/2 lb Blk angus beef, and with the broiled flavor it's awsome IMHO better then in&out protein burger and not as crowded :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by Carl's Jr. after a Doctor's appointment for some lunch, specifically to buy a Jalapeno Turkey Burger. The sandwich looked appetizing in its advertisements, as I love turkey burgers and enjoy anything spicy. Since Carl's Jr. usually makes pretty tasty burgers of all varieties, I was looking forward to eating a juicy, flavorful, spicy turkey burger. I was sadly dissapointed.        I have eaten turkey burgers from almost every type of restaurant imaginable: expensive organic restaurants, burger joints, college cafeterias, and backyard barbecues. I don't consider myself a snob, and I don't pretend to have the highest standards when it comes to food. However, the Jalapeno Turkey Burger that I ate at Carl's Jr. was one of the worst I've eaten in a long time. The pattie was extremely rubbery and dry, which means it had been sitting in a warmer for an extended period of time. The bun was a tasty wheat bun, but unfortunately it was squished to the size of two pancakes. The sauce was minimal and the cheese was non-existent. As for the spice factor, the jalapeno's added hardly any flavor or heat to the lukewarm burger. They were some of the most bland jalapenos I have ever eaten. Overall, I would say that all of the promised components of the burger were there, but they were all much lower quality than what I was expecting from Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Two stars for the \"OK\" chicken sammich.  However, zero stars for the double western burger.  It was bland, and very dry.  The bacon was so gross.  I hate fast food, and Carls Jr. reminded me why..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular , you'll always catch me there at 2 or 1 in the morning lol was kinda bummed when I found out that my favorite worker no longer worked there anymore during night shifts. ): BUT the new girl is so sweet and makes sure I have everything I need or want. Great attitude & very sweet . Will continue to be a regular. Great service over night and great food."}
{"text":"It's fast food. It's kinda pricey. But it's worth it. Open 24 hours which is loverly. They need to bring back the jim beam bourbon burger. Fries are dopelicious. Yes, I said dopelicious."}
{"text":"Not 24 hours on Friday. Sat at their lit up drive thru with no answer. Looking forward to the entire franchise going out of business. It'll be their own fault.   If you're closed, shut your lights off. Duh! I shouldn't have to explain this to you. It's not rocket science.   Please just go out of business. Thank you"}
{"text":"Usually I dislike going to most drive-thru places at night as most employees treat you like crap because they hate their job. However, few days ago I went and Kin was the best ever!!! Super friendly. Definitely would love to see more employees like him. Great customer service! :)"}
{"text":"The good. ... it's open 24 hours.  The bad. ... it takes them forever to get your order and when they do it's not hot, oh ya and they forget part of your order.   30 minutes isn't acceptable for a fast food restaurant drive thru.  Especially when they forget to give you stuff you've already paid for."}
{"text":"I rate this one star because there is not an option for zero. (Yelp should make this an option) where to begin.. sigh, so many things wrong here. I pull up to the drive thru and oder four meals (2 kids meals and 2 adult ones). Everything at this point seemed normal enough, until it too damn near 20 minutes of waiting to get food, afterall, there was no one else they were helping. The drive thru and the eat in area was empty. I figured the lateness of this wpd be the result of freshly prepared food, I was completely wrong. I get the food I get home. Fist thing I noticed after taking a bit was the patty was hard, room temperature, and burnt, the whole thing was as if it had been sitting out and had been slapped back together from where ever it came from(disgusting ). The other beef burger was room temperature, hard, bacon still soft, stale bread, and under cooked onion rings, and stale fries as well. The kids meals: fries half cooked(some were still cold), burnt chicken stars, The burger bun was a regular sized bun and and a tiny undercooked child's beef patty. We did not eat the food after the first bite, as I am assuming it came from the trash. I have always thought carl's jr. to be synonymous with great value, I can see now that this is completely and utterly untrue. I will never visit this place again, words cannot fully bring to light my digest and horror of having gone here."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the drive thru at lunch tine moves slow as hell even when there is nobody there. This is supposed to be FAST food right. Smh damn! Are yall literally hunting down the meat, killing it and then cooking in the back."}
{"text":"We had to come here since the eastern location was cleaning their grills. I'm very glad because this location is great! They were nice, spoke clearly and had no trouble customizing my order. I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"I come here mostly in the mornings. The service is always fast as possible and with a smile. They always offer me treats for my furry driving buddies."}
{"text":"No soap in the women's restroom....employees must wash their hands?!?  That was not a fun find!"}
{"text":"This is not only one of the best Carl's Jr that I have been to but one of the best restaurants that I've ever been to as far as service goes. I've been here about 20 times now and the service has always been extremely awesome. Management and staff seem to all be working together and a super friendly. They really make me feel welcome and the they want my business. Thanks to you all."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service been going here for years love this place lily one of the managers on duty when I go is awesome always smiling and very friendly don't change a thing but the prices lol"}
{"text":"Thought I would \"treat\" myself on the way to work.  Stopped and ordered a sausage breakfast sandwich and was told they did not serve breakfast at 4:50am, they start at 5am.  When there is no one else in line and there are 2 other food chains (McDonald's and Jack in the Box) on the other 2 corners serving breakfast...probably a good time to get breakfast going...don't you think?"}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch with my grandmother. Had a grilled chicken sandwich. and a California burrito. We went drive thru which was a little on the slow side. However our was correct and we got alot of food for the money. The staff was friendly and got our order correct."}
{"text":"Raja & Tyler provided excellent service at the drive thru. Such  service is hard to come by. The food was delicious. Ordered standard cheeseburger and I wanted to have sourdough bread instead of the standard bun. Burger and fries were awesome. My dr pepper was on point as well. There are times service can be slow, but I will wait as long as  I receive delicious, hot, fresh food."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge Carl's Jr fan but recently the portion sizes have started to get smaller.   Anyone else notice this with the Hamburgers here?"}
{"text":"I love the cheap drinks. Cheaper than QT even...  And the spicy chicken isn't bad either.  BUT the person who takes the drive thru orders should really learn English.   The Drive Thru Story:  I'd like a Large Sweet Tea please.  A what? What size?  A LARGE SWEET TEA.  An unsweetened tea? What size?  LARGE AND SWEET.  Okay Thank You.   I pull up to the window...  Here is your raspberry sweet tea.  No. No raspberry. Just a sweet tea.  Oh. Oh okay sorry.  Brings out another drink. I drive away. Take a sip....  Unsweetened."}
{"text":"We were greeted immediately after entering by the Drive thru lady and told the cashier would be right with us. Came here at around 2pm. Our food was hot and fresh. We got the $5 box meal that includes a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, small fries, cookie, and a drink. The inside was super clean. The cashier was very friendly. We waited about 5 min for our food. The spicy chicken sandwich was definitely better than the burger. Fries were awesome. Will be back to try other menu items in the future."}
{"text":"I ate a burger from this place and it had mold on it. Worst place in the world I threw up for 4 days straight."}
{"text":"I stopped by late night to get some food, the burgers and everything were great, however the 15 minutes I had to wait in the drive thru and the French fries were not. I ordered a large fry and they completely shorted me. Really disappointed when I've had nothing but good experiences here. Not happy tonight."}
{"text":"My dad when to This location today 5/5/2015 around 10am. There was sharp metal pieces inside his burger patty. He ordered a #6.  He whent to the hospital cause of it. If you know of anyonE or u when there too n have stomach problems  please go to the hospital and make sure you tell them you ate their. Please don't think twice about it. Make sure ur OK."}
{"text":"I ate here on 9 Jan 17 at 1200 hrs and took my food to go . Got home ate and at 1700 hrs all the food I had from them came right back up . Went to doc`s next day and was told I had a classic case of food poisioning . Couldnt eat or hardly drink anything for two and half days . Needless to say I will not be eating at this restaurant or any other Carls Jr again ."}
{"text":"It's not often I'm impressed with a fast food joint, but this place did good.  Yesterday I went to the drive through to take a burger home for dinner. Long story short, one daughter working, the other at a movie with friends, the wife out of town.  I'm on my own....no need to cook a meal.  The girl at the drive through was friendly and courteous.  Food was prepared relatively quickly, and the best part is....they got it right! I got exactly what I ordered! That doesn't happen often, so I'm happy to write a good review for a burger place."}
{"text":"I love CJ's, some of the better quality fast food around, but this place is AWFUL. Always out of apple slices, and half the staff INSISTS there is no such thing as a large order of onion rings. I am consistently dissatisfied here, but unless I feel like driving all the way to Fiesta Mall I'm stuck going here. I'm giving it 2 stars because even though the people that work here are dumb as bricks, they are usually really friendly."}
{"text":"First and foremost, if you do not speak Spanish, don`t bother with this Carl`s Jr. They will muck up your order if you try to make an adjustment to it, like no ketchup or extra pickles. Next, If you want to have your order to go, eat it on your way out the door. I live 1/4 mile away and my fries and most of my burger were cold by the time I got them out of the bag onto my table. On top of that, if you asked to have something changed on your order, you are, like me doing this twice. I keep telling myself I am not going to go back, but they keep sending the ridiculous coupons in the mail and I keep getting suckered into it. Please stop sending the damn coupons you bastards your food sucks and your commercials are not making it any better."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my family's favorite stops. Food was good, place was clean, and employees always nice and great service. Apparently it has been sold and the changes haven't been positive. Firstly, the salsa bar was taken out. The restaurant isn't as clean and the bathroom was gross. Portions are cheap, the chicken nachos are one third the size they used to be and not very tasty. Whoever purchased it didn't do it any favors. It has been crossed off my list. I'd rather go another mile to In and Out."}
{"text":"Slow service. I've been sitting in my car for 20 minutes now. They are averaging 5 minutes a car. Good food but I just want a quick bite and go to bed already!!!!  Update over 30 minutes now. Beware of midnight drive thrus."}
{"text":"Very rarely does a fast food restaurant have such good customer service as this location dose. The food is fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I flew in from LA and felt like hitting a familiar spot. This Carl's is by far the cleanest, most hospitable fast food spot I've been too. It's a refreshing change from the scummy Carls Jr of LA."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst experience in any fast food establishment, EVER!  First of all, instead of ordering 3 of the bacon egg and cheese biscuits, I decided to upgrade and pay extra for the mile high bacon egg and cheese because it looked so good in the picture.  There was a paper thin amount of eggs on every sandwich instead of the hearty amount illustrated on the menu.  It looked nothing like the picture.  I know there is a shortage in eggs across the country, either charge more or make the customer aware.  Charging me the same price and not putting eggs on my sandwich isn't right.  Not really a big deal, so my order got messed up, I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, so I call down to the restaurant to complain and the phone just rings and rings for over 10 minutes.  Finally somebody picks up and hangs up right away, I guess they got tired of listening to the phone ring. So I call right back.  I tell the girl that answers that I want to talk to a manager, she tells me that the manager isn't there and that I need to call back in 10 minutes.  I ask for the manager's name and the respondent tells me that she isn't going to give me that information.  I ask for her name and she tells me that she isn't going to give me that information either, then she proceeds to tell, not ask, me to call back in 10 minutes and she hangs up on me.  I only ask for names so I know who I'm talking to and who I'm looking to speak with; I didn't know it was a conspiracy.  If first names are so secret, why do they make them wear name tags??  Called back 10 minutes later and was told that the manager is off and wont be in until Monday.  I guess I'll just keep my complaints to myself."}
{"text":"I'm really beginning to wonder what kind of expectations and taste buds some of these reviewers have or if they have been paid.   This location is dead most of the time.  Their parking lost has NEVER been full.    I've tried their food a few times and hated it.   I would have enjoyed a cardboard box more.    There are other places close by that have a great burger for close to the same price.    The Carl's in the past years were better than this crap.   The fries are horrible!!!!     They can have their cheap food advertised on the window banners all they want.    I will NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"So this is like one of the ONLY places open at 9 am ... when I go to lunch... that is right 9 am lunch ... which is more like brunch or breakfast.  But since I wake up at 4 am and have breakfast pretty early... 9 am is definitely lunch.   I typically get one of two items here ... Either the teriyaki burger... which I actually dreamed I ate last night.  OR the Sante Fe Chicken Sandwich.. (mmmm green chile)  This location always has really good food, and really good service.  Also their Dr. Pepper is not too bad either.  Will I be back... yeah and not just because my options are limited."}
{"text":"Had a half pound jalapeno burger and was yummy. Wife had a guacamole bacon burger and she liked it as well. As we waited for onion rings they brought out a small fry. Service was great. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went in to Carl's during my lunch break. I Ordered the Taco Salad. It was topped with ground beef that I thought was a bit to greasy. On the plus side, the staff is friendly and you can find Squirt at the fountain bar!"}
{"text":"This was the worst hamburger I have ever had.  Was a Western Burger, the onion rings, bun, bacon, and hamburger were so hard I could hardly chew it.  Ended up throwing it out.  TERRIBLE!  Never going back!  Drive through and it took about 15 minutes with only one other car in line ahead of us!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru. and ordered a $6 classic burger,chicken sandwich. Ouion rings,zucchini, the only good thing was the zucchini was hot. Everything else was cold and chuey. Called the 800 number on recite and told them I wanted my money back. So a few weeks later they sent me some cupon for free any chicken sandwich, and any 1/3 lb.burger. I go back and ordered crispy chicken sandwich and 1/3lb. Burger,fries,ouion rings. The chicken sandwich looked like someone stepped on it, flat as a pancake and cold. The burger not much better. I have 4 more free sandwich cupons that I threw away and will never go back."}
{"text":"Drive thru guy was so nice for a Carl's Jr. The food is fast and easy. Yummy burgers. It's fast food at the end of the day, no frills no BS hipster food."}
{"text":"Honestly I love Carl's Jr and prefer it over any other fast food burger joint. They're always coming out with new burgers and have great deals and coupons!"}
{"text":"So I'm running late for work but I'm hungry so as I'm going down Craig rd I see a lite up carls jr, so I turn around now definantly going to be late. So I pull into the drive thru all the lights are on inside & out the menu board is lite up the screen is even lite up so I wait, I honk a few times-nothing so I'm still in a hurry and I pull up to the window and honk and even knock on the window and nothing...... Why would everything be lite up and their closed??? How ignorant and rude! It's one thing to have on your cj signs but every lite? I believe that's called false advertisement..... Well I'm late and still hungry cj thanks for nothing!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not into burgers, but my family is and this place is right down the street from my house. I tried a burger low carb style and it was amazing!!! We went through the drive thru and their was a little wait for our food to be made, which I can't complain about if it's being made fresh!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is decent....biggest issue is they don't acknowledge you when you're inside waiting at the counter!  I've literally stood there as employees clocked in and out,  chit chatted about nothing and run reports and it was like I was invisible to all if them. This has happened to me several different times at different times of the day.  Service is good once they acknowledge you and take your order"}
{"text":"My husband was raving about the all natural beef burger. He said he would have to take me to try one because it was absolutely delicious!!  He said it was juicy and the bun was really, really good. No fries necessary with his meal because the burger satisfied his appetite completely!! I will definitely go with him to try one. I haver tried the Western Bacon Cheeseburger; they're delicious too!"}
{"text":"Food needs some improvement. Plus , i called earlier to ask if yall can donate for my school's signing party. I found it so rude how the woman who spoke to me had the nerve to hang up! You guys need better service and be more friendly to your customers."}
{"text":"Yes they were nice, but would you speak some English for gods sake?! Can't even understand the cashier at this \"American\" restaurant! This is just garbage and she did nothing but rush me. Maybe we should have an English speaking test for all new hires, so that customer can be happy with their experience here"}
{"text":"First off we got there and they said we're out of onion rings and Dr Pepper, which sucked because the burger I wanted had onion rings on it. I decided to get a guacamole burger instead and proceeded through the drive through. Poor customer service from the guy working the window. When I got home I opened up my burger and found this. Very upset. A tiny bit of guacamole and 2 pieces of bacon, waste of money"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Carl's JR Chicken Tenders.   This place is awful.  The tenders are over cooked, they messed up my order  Iordered 20 Tenders for me and the kids. We got 10 pieces and they are awful.  And their website is broken so I can't post an email to them either..... If I could do 0 stars right now. GRRRRRRRRRRRR"}
{"text":"Sad. This use to be a real nice place to eat. Whole place was empty besides my family, two homeless men that smelled horrible, did not look anyone ever cleans the place. Turned into a dive. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food isn't nearly as delicious as it looks on tv. Fish sandwich was very bland and fries were way too salty. Service was friendly. Found it pleasant that they came around to ask us how everything turned out and if we needed anything. They also jumped at the chance to take our trash away for us."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars for this location I would. I've been here multiple times and each time something has happened that has made me want to not return but I try it again. Last time it was their unkept employees yelling back and forth to each other across the restaurant and an employee  very unprofessionally interviewing a person in the dining area. My parents were with us on this visit and they could not believe the employees and how they were acting in front of all the customers!! Tonight I went through the drive thru and was stuck for 30 minutes... I came out with a wrong order and cold food. First off, I had tried to order chicken tenders and was told they didn't have any. So I ordered another item and ended up not even getting it. When I mentioned to the employee my order was wrong on the receipt (I couldn't verify on the screen at the menu since it was of course broken) she questioned if I really had ordered that even though I had asked her a question about it over the speaker and she had answered it about the item. She didn't offer to fix the order and I told her I didn't want the item if I would have to wait longer since I had been there long enough. I FINALLY got my food and the drink of course was forgotten and I had to bring that up to the employee as well. I feel bad for the 4 cars that pulled in after me!! The car in front of me left without even getting there food because it was ridiculous!!! I never plan to return to this location. Thirty minutes in a drive thru should never happen and the employees need some training on professionalism and customer service."}
{"text":"THEY JUST OPENED UP A CARL's JR at the corner of Blue Diamond and Decatur. So the family and I had Carl's Jr last night for dinner. I had the Teriyaki chicken sandwich with Pineapple. As I began eating, I could taste the teriyaki right of the back. It was very delicious, but then I got to the pineapple.. The pineapple was good too, however, the combination of the teriyaki chicken and pineapple did not mix very well for me. I have eaten at Carl's Jr before and had other good meals, and don't get me wrong, this one was good, but just the combination of the pineapple and teriyaki was not a good combo!! That is why I am still giving them a 3-star... they are good. I wanna try the mushroom burgers... Plus my son tried one. He said that it was good and he gives the sandwich a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I usually have a quick and easy experience with Carl's Jr. Apparently not during my experience at this Carl's Jr. I ordered through the drive thru and it took forever, and when I pulled up to get my order, the employee was moving so slow! Now wonder there was a wait.   I ordered a malt, and received basically thick chocolate milk. I would recommend somewhere else to order a malt and fulfill that craving.   The burger was decent. One of my favorite things are jalapeno poppers and that came out to me warm. Usually I get it hot!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. The service at this location was so horrible. It took 15 min just to order as all the employees ran around clueless. The manager Angelina had no order and yelled at her employees making everyone feel very awkward. One woman waited 25 min for fries. The cook in the back dropped over a dozen buns on the floor and looked up to see who saw, Im sure if I didn't make eye contact she should of picked them up and used them! Horrible horrible never coming back."}
{"text":"Did not even get to order my food... Came here late at night one time with me my wife and a friend... Apparently some guy named Ben was closing out his drawer and decided to close the whole restaurant down so that he can do so... Turning down for customers in line waiting to order... Then proceeded to tell me that he will not take another order and to come back later... This is a 24 hour Carl's jr... Just a little disappointment sorry Carl's jr."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but they messed up on my order 3 times already.  No cheese means NO CHEESE.  I was hesitant to go through the drive-thru because you get 'seconds' compared to what you get going in the store.  I bought the #1 meal w/o cheese and with onions rings instead of fries and a small drink.  First of all, my food was served in a SMALL bag for my meal...there was no room to close it.  No napkins either (probably because there was NO ROOM).  I honked to ask for napkins but no one came back so I left.  The burger looked real good and I enjoyed it until I tasted the cheese.  There was a slice of cheese in it.  The onion rings were cooked well but all were broken and stringy onions.  That is what I usually get going in the drive thru lane.  If I went in the store they wouldn't be all broken and stringy and packaged better.  This seems to be common practice with this food chain.  I did not finish the burger and it was a huge mess...it fell apart after eating half.  Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"They always get my order right.  I've never been asked to pull around the front like so many other places do to cover how long it takes them to get an order out the window.  My food is always well-prepared and hot.  Most importantly, I appreciate how friendly I'm always treated.  The people working in every  other drive through I've been to in this town seem to think the proper answer to being thanked is, \"No problem,\" What a far cry from saying,\"You are welcome,\" that is!   I love that the response at this store is, \"My pleasure.\"  I'll drive out of my way for friendly service like that!"}
{"text":"Twice in the last week this location and it's staff have exceeded my expectations for customer Service , cleanliness and food prep! Chorizo biscuit looked spot on to the photo and tasted better than I really expected a national chain to manage with a Chorizo menu item. The potato bites were crispy hot and retained their shape. The bright charming voice of the drive through belonged to a bright smiling young lady who smiles and double checks orders!  She is a keeper and a true asset at this location!"}
{"text":"Marleth forgot to enter our 3 chicken sandwiches in the the drive thru line. When we arrived at the window she read back an order that was not ours. She realized she forgot to enter what we ordered, looked at us and said loud and clear \"FUCK!\" She look over to one of her co-workers and said \"Shit, see why I need to go home early?\" She also showed her frustration with the customer ordering thru the headset as she failed to multitask and rolled her eyes as we waited. Get rid of this girl is is truly bad for business."}
{"text":"We're visiting from NY. Stopped at this Carl's Jr. for lunch and waited 10 mins before Supervisor Elijah came to help us out. He was working so fast that even us NYers were amazed. We soon realized that Elijah was the only one working other than the cook. Our impatience turned to sympathy once we realized that this kid had to work the drive thru, the front counter and not to mention make us the three milkshakes we ordered. Shout out to Elijah and the professional service he gave us (9 customers). The food was great as well; we don't have Carl's Jr. on NY!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service they don't do their orders right always a wait no apology for the wait. Argue with customers over amount of food"}
{"text":"Crappiest service ever!!! I went through the drive thru and I waited a few mins for them to take the order then pulled up to the window and waited another six minutes before the guy at the window opened up to repeat my order wrong! I ordered two spicy chicken sandwiches one with no mayo and two small fries. How do you mess that up?!  Then proceeded to wait another six mins for my food. They must not understand the meaning of DRIVE THRU!! Don't visit unless you have plenty of time to waste!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 for  1 Carl's Jr. what a disappointment Whoever made it slopped it together  There was so much ketchup on it it was disgusting I wanted to eat one with my husband but I gave him mine and all I heard from him was him  complaining how bad his food was. Guess I won't be going to Carl's Jr. anytime soon."}
{"text":"Avoid this place!! They are so slow but the biggest issue is that they charged my card three times please check & make sure this didn't happened to you! Worst experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is above average for fast food but the staff at this location is terrible, I live in area and been visiting for years but the staff is always rude, they never greet or thank you, English language is a problem for them but I think the management is the problem as the staff changes but the rudeness never does."}
{"text":"This the worst Carl's Jr anywhere. . I can't believe this location is still in business. .need to hire better employees."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr has been running the $1 large drink promotion for quite a while now. Recently, they added a little sign wrap to their order speaker that said \"Drinks $1\" but they failed to mention this is just for their MEDIUM drinks, and that their large drinks have gone up in price. It would not have been a huge deal, except they have failed to remove the signage and are charging customers more for the large drinks. My husband ordered us both drinks and a spicy chicken sandwich for him. When he was told the order total, he questioned it at the window. He was then argued with numerous times by a snotty brat of a manager. All the \"crew members\" left the front area and when he received his sandwich he drove off, looked at his sandwich and it had been SPIT ON! A big fat loogie! This will NOT be the last time this particular Carl's Junior hears from us! Corporate will be contacted as will the owner of this particular franchise AND the Health Department and the BBB! This restaurant needs to be SHUT DOWN! We are DISGUSTED!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here but at this location the drive thru always takes forever! Today I sat waiting for over 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Not very happy with this location.  Recently I attempted to place an order and the lady can understand, me which is fine and understandable so I repeated the order about 4 times! She still couldn't understand me so I decided not to order there, while I was driving through the drive thru the girl who couldn't understand my order decided it was a good idea to stick her head out the window and flip me off for not ordering from this location. What great customer service"}
{"text":"I would recommend that you ignore some of the older reviews as this location has definitely improved over time. I used to constantly have errors with my orders; missing sauces, no straw, wrong side, etc. But I started going here again recently and boy have the cleaned up their act. Their employees are very nice and respectful. Over the few recent times I've been there my orders have been 100% correct.  I'd honestly recommend to stay away from the chicken since I've heard many negative remarks about their chicken. Their burgers are great, I'd recommend the Big Carl or whatever the special is.  Oh and try to find coupons, they are a bit pricey... but you do get a lot of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Carl's Jr. visitor.  I was really impressed with the service here. The person on the front register, I believe his name was Jessi. Or at least that is what the receipt says.  Food was fresh and hot. Clean as a place could be.  Good job guys."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst carls jr I have ever been to. Everytime I go there they mess up my order, the service is soo slow, and they never have things in stock. One time I went here and they were out of coffee lids so the employee just gave me the coffee without it, and I was in the drive through. Also the coffee had a layer of grounds on the top of it. I ask them for a low carb ask them twice to make sure it's a low carb, and I get it with the bun. This last time I went I asked for a natural burger low carb without cheese, the girl repeated the order twice and I got a Jalapeno burger. What the f!?? Unfortunately this is the closest one to my house and my son like carls jr but I'am not going back!! They need to fire the whole staff and get new management."}
{"text":"Big space inside. Clean, good seating options. Friendly helpful service with a smile. Stopped here early on Mother's Day 2015 on our way to Vegas. Across the parking lot is a Home Depot with lots of parking."}
{"text":"Seriously. I've lived right by here for 3 years and nothing has changed.  No line.  Waiting at speaker. They tell me to please hold.  Like what? There's no line? Finally get to order and I'm literally waiting for 13 minutes? No customers inside and there was no line? I don't understand it? I try to avoid this place, but anytime I decide to stop there, I pray it has changed. I pray that it can be one of my favorite places and not piss me off.  This is seriously THE WORST FAST FOOD JOINT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh.  A burger chain hailing from the States, I believe this is the first spot they've opened in Toronto.   The space is really large for a fast food joint, so your likelihood of getting a spot for a quick burger is high.   On my visit, I ordered the Star burger plus bacon ranch fries on the side.  Tip: The combos aren't very good - you really don't get much of a savings and is basically like ordering each item separately/added on to your burger.   The burger was pretty large diameter wise, but not a very thick patty.  The vegetable toppings seemed pretty fresh. You don't get to choose what's in your burger.   I regret getting the bacon ranch fries - for about $5 you get a large box of fries with a large dollop of ranch dressing plus bacon bits on top.  The fries are like the frozen kind you get out of the grocery store.    I suppose if you come in with zero expectations beyond what you'd usually get from any food court or drive-through, it wouldn't be so bad cause it's exactly what you'll get."}
{"text":"This place always closes about 15 minutes early. On this occasion it was 8:45 and all of the lights were out and drive through not open. Horribly rude staff, and a manager that obviously doesn't know how to manage properly. And people sit and wonder why so many of their stores close."}
{"text":"My and my little nephew went here on Thursday because I didn't feel like cooking.  We went through the drive thru because I was too lazy to walk in.  We ordered the western bacon cheeseburger combo, chicken tenders, and 2 orders of jalapeno poppers.  Everything came out to almost a whopping $25.00 sheesh but they have always been on the high end compared to others.  The lady that took my order was really nice and efficient.  It did take just a little longer to get our meal because they had to prepare the poppers and chicken tenders but we didn't mind as long as it was fresh.  And they got our order exactly right which I can truly appreciate."}
{"text":"I'm convinced now after several bad experiences, that all the night shift employees at this location are severely mentally handicapped, and are the pure manifestation of incompetence."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment today to order a chicken salad I waited over 25 minutes for this but did not get my order I went to the same guy that took my order he went back into the kitchen and it was just sitting on the shelf no apology no nothing problem is I gave him the salad gave him the money and walked out the store and nobody came after me to talk to me now I'm a person that goes to a Carl's jr. More than 20-plus times per year I guess I will find another restaurant"}
{"text":"It's just OK.  I thought the burger was going to be amazing, considering Carl Jr.'s from the states. But as I kept eating the burger it tasted like I've eaten the sandwich somewhere else before ... The burgers taste like a crossover between A&W and Burger King. Disappointing! This would be my last choice when deciding where to eat after work. It's filling, but not satisfying."}
{"text":"Bunch of clueless workers here. Drive thru is a joke keep away........do yourself a favor and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Came in to get some dinner.  Two western cheeseburgers.  One no cheese and one no bbq sauce.  Also ordered a large fry and coke.  Doug was the nice gentleman at the window. Very helpful and even had me check my order to ensure it was correct.  It was! Each time I come here I always have the best customer service experience. Couple that with yummy food and a 10% student discount.   WINNING!"}
{"text":"shitty food big chicken filet now being served with small cheap spicy chicken sand filet. shit load of lettuce, tons of mayo on all breads wraped in wax paper, falls apart when opened, you get this with zero napkins if you ask you get two napkins, the mess of your life. over priced no managers anywhere, owner owns all stores in las vegas, runs shops how  he likes, big FU to you the owner"}
{"text":"When we entered this place we could smell a stench like sewage backing up. However we pressed on. It was hot and we needed something to cool us down.   My wife and I ordered two chocolate malts. The lady pulled out two cups from a freezer that had frozen ice cream in them and popped them in the microwave. (A little odd if you ask me. Not exactly \"hand scooped and hand made\" as the ads would indicate.)  Then when she had thawed the ice cream enough she pulled them out of the microwave and mixed the chocolate and the malt into them.   When she served them they were way below the cup line. Looked like almost half of the product that was supposed to be in them. My wife and I asked about it and the girl said: \"We can't put more than eight ounces in the cup.\"   We shrugged and took the malts and sat down.   About halfway through my malt I decided to go to the Carl's Jr. website to see the actual serving size.   14.6 ounces and NOT 8 ounces.   I asked for the manager. She confirmed that the product size was only eight ounces. I then showed her on the Carl's Jr. site that the serving size was SUPPOSED to be 14.6 ounces. She shrugged and said that was what the owner told them to do and I asked for his name. She wouldn't give it to me.   I informed her that they were ripping off their customers and that we would let Carl's Jr. corporate office know about it.  I've eaten at other Carl's Jr. locations with no problems but this particular store on Jewel should be avoided like the plague!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable... the restrooms couldn't possibly be cleaned every 2 hours! I had to take pictures... I will be sharing this experience with the district manager."}
{"text":"Well inhave come to this location 3 times and every time they fuck up my order ! Sad because I love this place. Today these..... im going to compose myself, I bought a double burger and i got a single ! What kinda shit man thats $1 and change thats a burger in its self (at mcdonalds lol)"}
{"text":"I tried their new Memphis BBQ Thickburger today and was very disappointed. While what you see on the commercial looks delicious, what you actually get looks nothing like that. I got the Double Patty. Both patty's tasted dried out and very un-fresh. There was a tiny bit of shredded pork on top, and a couple of very soggy onion rings. I can not see this disgraceful burger on their menu for very long, cuz it really sucks. Luckily in the burger world we have many options to choose from. I don't think I will be having Carl's Jr. for awhile. I did enjoy their Fried Zucchini though."}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances...Carls's is my favorite (5 star) fast food burger joint.  I have many a found memories i.e., using my debit card for the first time to purchase Carl Karcher's mythical WESTERN BACON CHEESEBURGER..It deserves to be in all capitals.  With that being said...I have been to this CJR's twice now and both times hitting the drive-thru.  Don't roll in on a Friday night because it is busy and you will wait.  On my most recent visit, I went on a Saturday afternoon and was met with three vehicles ahead of me and......I waited.  The food on both occasions was great, the service was friendly but the wait.....Ahhhh the wait.  A solid A-OK experience."}
{"text":"Let me say first that CJ's is my 2nd favorite burger chain.  This one, though, had the worst excuse for a 6-Dollar burger ever, the Turkey burger was completely flavor-free, and the chicken strips were... bitter.  How is chicken bitter?  There's a joke somewhere...  Bleah.  Never again.  Not this store anyway."}
{"text":"Was heading south on the 95 with the GF when we both realized we were starving while heading down to the Smith Center.  We got off the 95 at Rainbow and hit CJ's for a quick bite.    It was a cheat (reload day) but I was in the neutral area of my caloric intake and opted for a 1/2 Lbs El Diablo burger.  Some fires shared with the GF and a small iced tea.    Te service was good to go.  The squawk boxes the only difficulty.  At the window, all was smiles.  There was zero drama..as we consume our meal in the adjacent parking lot.  This location served will in a pinch.  When heading south on the 95, I would not hesitate to use in a pinch!  A solid A-Ok in the when needed!"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr.  Is comfort food from my childhood, and I'll always eat there when I can."}
{"text":"Growing up in San Diego in the 1970's meant Mickey D's, Jacks, BK, KY Fry, DW, and if I was good, Carl's Jr.  A Super Star with Cheese, Criss-Cut Fries and a drink was a treat.  It still is.  With all the choices in fast food burgers, Carl's is still one of the chains at the top of my list.  As a matter of fact, I think it sounds good for dinner tonight on my way to DeMolay."}
{"text":"STRAIT UP NASTY!!!  I was going to get breakfast from McDonald's but they had a long drive through line and I was starving. Carl's Jr. being next door had no one in the drive through or anyone inside. Walked in to avoid eating in my car in the heat. OMG WTH was I thinking?  First, they had the typical radio songs playing inside, but as I walked up to the register I hear Mexican music blasting from the kitchen. I love me some Mexican music, but overlapping music was so unprofessional! Katy Perry and mariachi music. It didn't flow.  The guy at the register was nice. Ordered my food. Went sat down to wait for it to come.  The furniture was straight from the early 90s. Tables looked like they hadn't been cleaned , floors were dirty, and no joke, a spider hanging on a web 1 table down.  I look around, the ceiling had a hole in it that looked like something chewed it open. Looked around, same type of holes along some of the bottom wall trimmings.   Then my food came. It was the register guy bringing it, again he was super nice. Started eating it and something tasted off. Saw some blue thing in it. I decided to stop eating it, throw it away and leave. Walked up to the trash can and it's full.  Let me remind you, it was like 9-10 am. Why are the tables and floor dirty, and the trash full? They had no customers when I walked in and it couldn't have been that busy before I arrived.  I mean, I know it's just fast food but damn, cleanliness and basic maintenance can't be too much to ask for.  This is probably a sign from Jesus that I need to eat healthier. But hell no would I ever go back.  The cheap owners need to remodel ASAP, and retrain the staff or rehire."}
{"text":"One of the few fast food options in this area- open until at least midnight, quick fix for a grilled or crispy chicken salad in the late hours, which is all I use it for. Staff is young and competent but barely.  Have never had an issue with the freshness of the produce in my salads here, nor the freshness of the crispy chicken atop. Sometimes I'll cancel out the healthiness of my salad by ordering whatever their featured fry is- bacon ranch, buffalo bleu, it changes with their promoted burgers and they're usually oversalted but that doesn't deter me.  My last visit, the cashier disappeared with my card to the back of the store to run it, which I was not particularly comfortable with, nor was I given a reason as to why. I was also not given any receipt of any sort. Bank statement reflects correct charge, but considering how prevalent CC theft is in food service, I'm not coming here again."}
{"text":"Worst location ever. The guy taking our order sounded like he was on meth or something. It took him almost FIVE minutes just to take our order at the drive through window. We repeated things back several times but when we finally drove up to the window we got one drink without the meal, one meal without the drink and no quesadilla for our daughter. We wasted 10 minutes at a drive thru with no cars ahead of us and still didn't get our order. If you have to have Carl Jr's - don't have it here - waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The Manager Shanon is a GEM. She is an asset to your restaurant. Every time I stop in she is very professional and always gets my order right."}
{"text":"This is a new location, and I will probably try it again, but I was not happy today. I wanted a 20 piece chicken nugget for the kids. What I got & paid for was 20 chicken tenders, which was significantly more expensive than I expected. It was also a lot more food than I needed. I also ordered two western bacon cheeseburgers for the wife and I. The drive thru attendant put all of the food in one big paper bag. It was so full it ripped while I was placing it on the passenger seat, spilling two medium orders of fries all over the floor of my vehicle. I included a picture of the ripped bag. This could have been avoided had he attendant just given me the bag of fries separately from the large bag of food. I should have gone in to the location and voiced my displeasure, but I was unable to at the time.   I ordered medium drinks, but received large drinks because they had run out of medium cups. Plus I guess, right? Not so much. I had to stop short on the way home and both large drinks fell out of my cup holders and one spilled all over the floor of my vehicle. The lid remained on the second, but it was quite a mess. This isn't really the restaurants fault, but it added to my frustration.   All the wife wanted was a lemonade and some French fries. Both items spilled all over the floor of my vehicle. The food that made it home intact was great, and I will try this location again, but it did leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Another location kicking out a consistent CJ product.  This was our first meal back on main land after arriving on a red-eye from Hawaii.  Having never had breakfast at Carl's given the time of day it seemed appropriate.  The service was friendly.  The biscuit breakfast sandwiches were tasty enough.  It was served with a bag of fried, round shaped hash browns in a bag.  The high calorie meal added to the many high calorie meals already eaten a thousand or so miles away."}
{"text":"This place has a problem. Mostly its just two teenagers working there, and that is about it. Ordered chicken sandwich that arrived cold. Not cold like room temp. cold but cold like still frozen cold. We return it and they look at us like \"what do you want me to do about it?\"    Its pretty apparent that the owner doesn't care about this branch, so they need to close it and get an owner that cares about their business."}
{"text":"Gave this location 3 tries. First time they messed up my order, but fixed it. 2nd time they forgot part of my order and had only 3 people working. Today and my final time, took over 10 minutes in drive thru, looked like only 2 people on staff, and kept asking me if it was for here or to go...in the drive thru. These people need to fix their stuff. When a hiring now is in the window, then hire some people. Damn. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"I waited in the drive through the over 10 minutes with one car in front of me. The women who took my order told me to hold and I waited 2 minutes before she asked me what I wanted. If have you time to burn this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Awful service. Obviously there is an issue with the management at this place.The employees were yelling and calling each other out in front of the customers which made it very awkward for me and my friends. It took a good 3 minutes for anyone to come to the register to take our order, and after that it took about 30 minutes for all of us to get our food. I was finished eating by the time the last person in my group got their food. The poor people I could see waiting for 10 minutes in the drive through! Also I saw the employees in the back handling the food and making burgers who were NOT wearing gloves. Good thing I only got fries and a shake!! I had never been to a Carl's Jr in my life and probably will never go back."}
{"text":"This has been a solid Carl's since it opened. I'm not the biggest fan of Capriotti's but my wife is and it's right next door so we both can grab what we want for dinner and eat at the Aliante park across the street. The manager for this location I hope stays because he's awesome. Very friendly staff that makes me forget I'm at a fast food place and they always have treats for my dog Brownie. If your dog is with you just ask for a treat they have them even at the drive thru window.   The famous star is a classic menu item and I miss the days when I was younger and they were like .99 cents. They still have different deals between the famous star, western bacon and big carl burgers so I usually end up getting whatever the promotion is. Food has been good and I can't complain about my order not being the way I ordered it because it has been correct. Not sure how long they will have Plants vs Zombies toys in the kids meals but given my wife has been addicted to the game for years I found it comical and fun."}
{"text":"Usually have great experiences at Carl's Jr.  Stopped in during lunch, they have one person working cashier who is also packing food into bags. One person in the kitchen. And one person running orders. They also have a line of stressed people trying to get some food and getting back to work on time. No acknowledgement or apology for the long wait. Multiple people walking out before ordering. Waiting 10 minutes in line at a fast food place before even placing an order seems a bit ridiculous.   This location is probably losing lots of money due to poor service if it's like this everyday during lunch."}
{"text":"Yeah just ordered a jalapeño TURKEY burger. They gave me a freaking beef patty BEEF!!!!!!! Oh and it's lukewarm... Has the tiniest piece of cheese (unmelted) on it I've ever seen and it took them 15 mins in the drive thru. Thought oh it's taking longer making a fresh turkey burger. Nope a cold beef patty is all you get. Soggy old tomatoes and lettuce. Stale French fries. Wow just wow. Wtf are you guys doing get your act together."}
{"text":"Was craving some of their fried zucchini! Waited a very long time for this order. I figured I'd also get the box meal deal, they get our order completely wrong. The fries were cold and stale and the onion rings were very hard. Service here was not good either! I don't really eat at fast food joints but I definitely don't care to wait 20 Minutes for a fast food order when I could have gone to outback and received food quicker. No thanks honey, I'll take my money somewhere else! My order there is cheaper, quicker, and more fresh ;)"}
{"text":"First me I wanna say I work in the fast food industry and I am a cashier so obviously I work with customers. At this Carl's junior they messed up on my order twice. The first time Idkeia was good with saying she would fix it and telling me how much more I'd have to pay. I waited for my famous star and I specifically said no tomato or pickle. Then a white girl gave me my order idk her name but she had very poor customer service. No smile and she talked as if she hated life. Then she forgot my fries and when I told her she looked like if she didn't know what to do. So then she asked idkeia what I was talking. Anyway I got my fries. I get home and of course pickle and tomato in my burger :) great. Me working as a cashier I know how to give great customer service and here I did not receive good customer service. Also the famous star tasted horrible."}
{"text":"Got a chicken sandwich from here still cold raw what ever you want to call it asked for my money back dude said he couldn't give me my money back that it has to be The Gm best belive I will be back for my money I didn't even eat that shit and for u to tell me it cooked no I work in the field I knew what's cooked right and not and to top it off he handled it very unprofessional pretty much telling me to leave the store never will I eat here aging"}
{"text":"DO NOT go here. They charged my card for all this food i didn't order. Now i am awaiting for my bank to handle. The 2 managers up front complete ignored us, and the poor drive thru guys Victor was handling the drive thru orders AND the lobby orders. Both managers were up front cursing and ignoring us laughing and joking. I am trying to get a hold of corporate to look into this and complain."}
{"text":"This Carls Jr is located close to my work, so I come here often for lunch. The service is always mediocre at this location, but I try to brush it off because it's located in a busy shopping center. However, yesterday I had my final straw. It took the cashier forever to take my order and she was rude over the speaker. I had to correct my order at the window because she misheard me. Although it was corrected on my receipt, she still gave me the wrong order and hurriedly pushed the bag into me arms and slammed the window shut on me. Bad service is always remembered and I won't ever come to this location again. Do yourself a favor and go to the one on Sunset instead. Service there is always top notch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers ever at a major burger chain is the \"Double Western Bacon Cheese Burger.\"  I don't eat them as often anymore because it would kill me.  Stopped in for a quick bite due to time being an issue.  This time around I thought that I would try something different.  I went with the new steak house burger.  It tasted ok and not like it was made by the god of hamburgers as seen on TV.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.  Someone actually walked and followed up on the meal, a rarity at any fast food joint."}
{"text":"The best Manager at this location!  I always get the lettuce wrap burgers and I'm there a couple times a week.   Always the best service, with a smile and super sweet personality."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Carl's Jr.  But this one is the worst I have ever been too. They gave out order to someone else first and then couldn't stop talking about there plans for the next night. I asked for mustard and it seemed like it was the worst thing I could have done. The food was dry and sad."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd and last time I will eat at this Carl's jr. I really didn't want to go in the first place but my bf wanted it . The ppl are just rude !! Andddd on top of that I had a chicken sandwich that look like it had Mold on it !!! When my BF went in to take it back they got real ugly and gave him extra attitude . The cook made a new sandwich and said \" here is a fresh one\" in a rude way pretty much through the sandwich."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday before work and while I was ordering my food the lady tried to up sell me on everything,  which is fine but when I agreed to one up - size (small to a medium) she tried to charge me for large. I had to correct her but it didn't bother her any. After that I pulled up to the window and paid for my food. After she hands me my food she quickly turns around and walks away. I tried my hardest to catch her before she got to far but she just ignored me. I knocked on the window several times.... honked several times and just waited. I easily waited about 4 minutes before I Googled the phone number and called inside... I told her that I was still in the drive thru and I have been waiting here trying to get her attention. She laughed at me and I hung up. Finally she came back to the window and didn't apologize or anything. I received the items I needed and left. I will never return to this Carl's Jr again! Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger and a nice cold drink. This isn't your McDonald's or Burger King. At Carl's Jr. You get what you pay for. As far as customer service goes, I have nothing but great things to say. My order has never been fumbled and everyone I've encountered thus far has always treated me very well."}
{"text":"I love Carl's but this location sucks.  Every time I drive past it it's empty and now I know why.  Had a breakfast biscuit meal and it was gross.  Biscuit crunched as I bit into it because of how old and stale it was, and the sausage did not taste like sausage.  It was rubbery and looked like it was recooked at least 3 times.  If the employees weren't so busy on there cell phones behind the counter they might be able to actually cook food instead of throwing some slop together."}
{"text":"The burger I had was from the menu on the left, the regular burgers for regular folk, nothing spectacular required. It was so good! Half of it was wrapped in paper so it could be held easily without the toppings falling out or getting any on your hands while chowing down. Nice, fluffy sesame coated gigantic saucer of a bun fit the burger perfectly and with crispy lettuce arranged nicely and I was in burger heaven. We ordered a couple combos, choosing the small combo deal, and we shared the fries.  One order of fries was the 'CrissCut' version, lightly seasoned and kind of a 'ripple chip' idea where the potato was cut into a chip shape with diagonal grooves that sometimes made perforations... worth a try! The other combo included their onion rings which were heavily crispy, almost crunchy on the outside, and on the very opposite side of the spectrum from soggy, and quite different from the standard Toronto onion ring you'd get at a greasy spoon diner.  The portions of the small combo items, the drink and fries, were very generous and with refills on the drinks, there was no need to supersize anything at all. A very satisfying meal for two costing $24 total with tax. I will go again, especially considering what I was hoping for: a stellar spot to bring weary Queen St. touring shoppers, who have exhausted themselves and are looking for a nice relaxing roomy restaurant amid the hubbub of shopping paradise. Go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey, if you're wasted at 2 am you could certainly do worse! It's fast food so of course it's not going to be totally stellar, but hey, it gets the job done! Turkey burgers are really good and I like the fried zucchini as well. Good job folks!"}
{"text":"I hate to do negative yelps, but I don't even know how this place is still in business. There were no other customers at lunch time, except for the guy laying down and sleeping in one of the booths. The cashier was polite but he looked and smelled like I interrupted his afternoon joint smoking. The tables looked clean but the floor was disgusting. I watched they guy in the kitchen grab my burger patty out of a bin of already cooked burgers (probably hours ago) and toss it in to the microwave.  I got my food to go, because I wanted to get out of there ASAP. Got home and cracked open the worst burger I've had in a long time. Just terrible. I've had better hamburgers in Korea.  It was cooked hours ago, zapped in the microwave and handed to me. I gave a piece to my dog and he walked away and licked himself for 20 minutes just to get the taste out of his mouth. I live nearby so I look forward to whatever this place becomes after it goes out of business."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru at about 10:40 at night with my boyfriend. I told the gentleman over the speaker I needed a couple minutes to decide on food. He then told me to hurry up because they closed at 11. I asked what came on the Big Carl and he didn't know. Or probably didn't give a because they closed in 20 minutes. I ended up getting a #2 with chicken tenders, only to get two chicken tenders and a bread nugget. Highly wouldn't recommend this Carl's Jr. The staff is rude as fuck and the food tasted like shit."}
{"text":"The food there was undercooked the tables were grows and sticky the salt and pepper shaker has red sticky stuff all over the top of it I personally recommend not going here is too filthy"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Carl's Jr. for many years.  I was out running some errands and needed some food.  This Carls's Jr. was very efficiently ran with very good employees.  The staff was very friendly and my order was prepared in about five minutes.  The entire order tasted great and was accurate.  The lobby was very clean as were the restrooms.  My experience was very good and I would happily return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"I went in there tonight and ordered a #1 SuperStar w/cheese combo, mentioned that I wouldn't mind the wait if they could cook my meal fresh. I received just the opposite a cold burger and old fries ... I was in a rush so I ate the horrible meal as is and left disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow did I have a great lunch at this Carl's. Super yummy burger with lotsa toppings.  Fries done just right. Shake was really chocolatey and good and thick. This Carl's rocks it all the way. Could use an update in terms of the really old fashioned decor at this spot.....but the food is da bombe.  go to this one if nearbye. And hope for some outdoor seating and some nicer booths. Oh and staff was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Stay away. This was The number three from the five dollar meal deal don't really have to say much picture speaks for it all ha ha Ha"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero star I would. First off I pull up and it takes her 10 minutes to even come to the window to get my money. She's in the back screaming and laughing with the cook the whole time. All of a sudden some guy comes out by the kitchen area and starts smoking... are you serious. That's a serious health violation. Then the lady who's taking my money starts calling someone in the back a fucking retard. She then begins to hand me my food and forgets my drinks and can't remember what I ordered to drink. After I get home and eat it I wake up with food poisoning!! Are you kidding me. If that kid is smoking in the restaurant I wonder what other heath violations are going on in the back. So disgusting. Beware and STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, quick service, and the meal was excellent!  I came at 11pm and I wasn't in the best of moods. By the time I got my meal I was cracking up! Cheers to the night shift for making a fast food trip a memorable experience at no extra cost. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The sign says they close the dining room at 11pm during the weeknight. We stopped by wanting to get in around 10:10pm and the doors were locked. There were other customers tying to get in as well, but no luck.   The cashier saw us all walking towards the door and she quickly went to the back when she saw us approaching it.   The drive thru says it's open 24 hours but who knows if it really is since they make up their own hours..."}
{"text":"The people taking orders at this place must not speak English cause everything on our order was wrong. Everything we asked to be taken off came in our order. It's dumb when they ask you to drive back with the food after you have gotten home and are ready to eat. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"OMG! Stay away from this location, the bathroom is a mess! The toliet seat is broken in half  and they were out of toliet paper except for the bunches on the floor.   I sent a email to Carl's Jr as well as calling their \"guest\" Hotline asking them to fix the problem before someone gets sick. I asked to be contacted by the GM or district management, nope I did get a a very nice email from Carl's Jr COO Carl LeLecke tell me he was sending me some free food coupons...  I waited two days do post hoping the would fix the prooblem I went back in today and the toliel teat is still  the broken one and most of the toliet paper is off the floor.   You know what they say about bathroom conditions and clealiness of restaurants.  Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"Went in and not only did I have to tell the cashier my order multiple times, after he took it someone had to come out and tell me they didn't have what I wanted and he had still gotten my combo meal wrong. Waited a very long time for food. Also the restaurant was messy, and not well stocked. Very disappointed and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"The new Big Chicken is a Big disaster. It also seemed like a corner of my sandwich did not make it into the deep fryer. I ended up cutting the thing into pieces and tossing it on the stove with some other stuff. This was the Bacon Swiss, it was supposed to be extra crunchy and dusted with spices, but neither occurred. The tomato slice was of course an end piece and the bun had so much mayo it was a soggy, gooey mess. One half of the bun got tossed. It was $4.99 and maybe it is just this location, but might give it one more shot somewhere else, but doubtful. Late night craving fail."}
{"text":"Tonight at 9:45 p.m. my husband, son, and I went into this Carl's Jr. Their lobby closes at 10, but the drive thru is open later. My son wanted the $4 real deal, while my husband was going to get a famous star and a western bacon cheeseburger with the mix and match for $6.   What happened next was terrible customer service! Debbie, the supervisor, told my husband that we had to take our food to go because they were closed. Then when he placed the order for my son and ordered his, she proceeded to tell him that he could only have two western bacon cheeseburgers. My husband then said, nevermind, just give us his food. He then went out to check the advertisement and it clearly said mix and match. I then told her that as a supervisor she should know what is advertised.   She then reminded us that we were getting this to go.   I've never encountered such terrible customer service before. If I could give them less than one star I would! I will never return here!"}
{"text":"9:05 am and no one at the counter. We yelled back to the kitchen...HELLO and some lady yelled hello back, but no one ever came out front to take our order..... we went to Dennys across the parking lot......"}
{"text":"It's been 17 years since I had my favorite breakfast food at Hardee's (Carl's Jr.), so I decided to drive the 6 miles to get some.  I was living in Florida the last time I had it and I don't think the two companies had merged, yet.   The menu item I'm writing about is their biscuit and gravy.  I ask for it to be fixed \"for here to go\" (meaning that the gravy is put on the biscuit in the to-go container, rather than it being served in a styrofoam bowl with a plastic lid -- you get more gravy with it prepared that way).   I bought two of that item, plus an order of hash rounds.   I got gone and was looking forward to the taste I'd been yearning for 17 years.  Wow.  Was I sorely disappointed in this \"food.\"  The biscuits were burned/over cooked on the bottom, making it impossible to cut through with their supplied plastic fork. They (with the gravy) were microwaved to the point of steam burn, pretty much erasing any taste that I could expect.   The hash rounds were cold and tasteless.  I only ate 3 and threw the rest away.  My dog wouldn't even eat one.   I have to say that I'll never order biscuits and gravy again from Carl's Jr. (at least not at THAT location)."}
{"text":"The burgers are always dry and flavorless. The employees are nice here, but the food just isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan.  The overall experience was pretty meh.  They had so many employees and most of them just seemed to stand around not doing anything.  This is your first day on the job, at least look busy even if you're not.  I do have to give recognition to a couple of guys who were very courteous and asked if we needed a refill, if one could take our tray, etc...  The cashier overcharged my friend and I wouldn't be surprised if that happened more than once throughout the day.  How does a small combo cost more than a large?  Oh, I know, it's because you charged for each individual item!  Prices on the menu were not clearly displayed.  They said that info would be updated in the next week or so.  Why are you open if you're not really ready to be open?  The burger patty was not juicy.  It was kinda dry.  The bread was good though.  The fries were good too.  You get free refills on drinks, self-serve.  That's a bonus I guess.    All in all, not the most impressive \"Grand Opening\".  I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service this morning from the manager ordered 3 breakfast burritos and a coffee came out to 17$$!!! Extremely over priced never can Ming here again"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my husband. Im thankful since they are open 24/7 that in the morning I can get anything on the menu. Working Graveyard shift you sometime get tired of breakfast food and want a Hamburger!! I got the Santa Fe Chicken burger and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito with nothing HOT/SPICEy in it.  When we got to the window they were very concerned to what exactly made it hot for my husband and even offered to change the cheese for him to. On top of that they gave us two of the homemade biscuts and jelly they have now for free. The biscutts were GOOD and the staff was Great. We will be back"}
{"text":"I really like the current SUPER BACON cheeseburger.  Get that thing with the double patties, and it is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I wish I never went in the first place. I ordered a 5 piece chicken tender, a small fry, and a small drink. When I saw the receipt I was baffled. $10 for some fast food? I could go to in n out for cheaper and better quality food. If they're charging that much it should at least be good. But when I began eating I noticed the chicken was tough and had little flavor. On top of that the fries were saturated in grease. Not to mention the staff somewhat unprofessional, it doesn't hurt to try harder. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here with the guys to get their 4 for 4 deal advertised on the website, I walk in and the cash register lady is like 99 1/2 years old. She looks like Rose from the movie titanic. Anyways I walk up and of course they're not giving the deal as advertised so I walked out. False advertising is stupid and real people who live off of principle will walk out as I did."}
{"text":"WOW! this was not the greatest. We went through the drive thru to order breakfast/lunch food. One you could not understand the person trying to take your order and then in the middle of giving our order 4 times He disappears off the speaker! My husband kept saying hello are you there. Then the guy comes back like nothing happened!! I was not a fan of the Biscuts and gravy. the Biscuts tasted like they were over done and just sitting there. YUCK... My husband ordered the Western Bacon with extra BBQ. I would hate to see it if we did not order extra BBQ. Looks like they squirted a nickel size of BBQ and that was it. UGGG Not a fan of this location."}
{"text":"Came to this location and didn't get a receipt with my food. It clearly states on the window that your food is free if you don't get a receipt. I called them out on this and they put up a big fight saying that they did give me the receipt, when of course they did not.   The food is bomb, but you shouldn't put this on your window if you aren't going to honor it.   Them crisscut fries though!"}
{"text":"I came in one night and waited so long in the drive thru line to them find out when I got home that my order was completely wrong. I was so upset and decided to call and they definitely turned my perception around. They offered me a new meal and when I came back I got everything comp'd and they even added a few extra items as well. They were sincerely sorry and wanted to make sure they fixed my bad experience. You can see that they actually care for their customers unlike many other places. People make mistakes, but the way to fix it is what matters. Kudos to this location!"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr is my go to fast food because they have the best lettuce wrapped burger. That being said, the last 2 times we have been here our order has been incorrect, the wait is long and the employees are beyond rude.   Went through the drive thru on Mother's Day after my kiddo ended up in the ER. Got 3 burgers,1 order of chicken, fries, zucchini and 3 drinks. 2 of the 3 burgers were wrong, 1 of the 3 drinks was wrong and we got 4 criss cut fries and half a container of soggy reg fries, even though we only ordered crisscut. And all of this for the bargain price of  $40!  I don't anticipate myself going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting and nasty sandwich was served here recently. What a waste of 5 bucks. Usually the grilled chicken is a safe choice at this chain, but on this day, after one bite it became clear that this meat was full of fat and veins and inedible. Unable to return as I went through Drive through, I used the receipt to contact customer service hotline. They responded via email and supposedly are sending me coupons to make up for the disaster. I won't be eating that sandwich again, nor using this location either if I cash in those well deserved freebies."}
{"text":"I'm giving a two star rating because they got my order right but the customer service was poor and the employee rolled their eyes at my boyfriend and gave us attitude for asking simple questions."}
{"text":"the \"manager\" Exxie was rude and argumentative, they were understaffed slow to process orders and recognize customers coming in. One of the kitchen personnel dropped the bag with the barbeque sauce in it on the floor, she proceeded to pick it up and cut it open and emptied into the container with the bag touching the surface where food is being prepped. I expressed I no longer wanted my order which pissed off Exxie who did not care to know why nor care to get me my refund until after she helped another guess after she had made me wait after I had told another worker to inform her which was done within my ear shot."}
{"text":"Don't go here at 10am because they ran out of biscuits for their breakfast sandwiches which is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Their food is good when prepared correctly but the staff isn't that friendly and forget about having it your way! Milkshakes are runny ( I asked for a thick one) and way too much sauce on the Avocado, bacon, jack cheese burger."}
{"text":"Meh. Went did Carl's Jr. take such a dive downhill? Or is it just this location? Every burger is a hockey puck. And the drive thru here always seems to take extra time and several minutes spent sorting out confusion. On my most recent (and likely last) trip here, I got that new American burger with the hot dog and potato chips. Hockey puck burger, overly tough bun, almost no potato chips, and horrible non-beef hot dog. I would actually describe it as disgusting. So sad. The jalapeno poppers were alright, but weren't actually jalapeno poppers. Instead of filling a jalapeno, they chop it up and deep fry it with some cheese. So you get a lot of cheese and very little jalapeno. Between the food quality and the constant staff confusion, I think I'm calling it quits on this Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service great staff today and another time when I accidentally knocked my fanny pack out of our truck it was found in the parking lot intact nothing missing.  They called me right away to retrieve it."}
{"text":"This is one of the better locations.  Always receive fast, friendly service here.  The staff is very sociable and talkative. Plus the food is always fresh, I haven't had a bad experience here yet."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Jim Beam bourbon burger. The service is always good, staff is friendly, they give a 10% military discount which is great. Their app does not work for this location and I've told them about 5 times."}
{"text":"The food is horrible and dried out. My peanut butter & jelly is better than this place.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"This is 1 of the only Carl's jr where your food will always come too hot! Great service in the burgers are always hot and good!"}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice now.... Or a few more... I guess I'm a regular by now. Easily the best Carl's I've ever been to. The staff is so friendly, service is FAST and really accurate, definitely exceeds expectations of a fast food joint. If you've given up hope of quick eats, check THIS location out. Whatever work ethic the management trains their employees with, it is instilled. And more times than not, that's what brings my business around. I like the food, love the people. They all have smiles and they give me one every time I come. :)"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. This location has been one of my favorite lunch destinations. However, they seem to be under new management and the service has really suffered. Today they refused to honor valid coupons that they were honoring just last week."}
{"text":"I wish they sold jalapeno burgers and not jalapeno's stem burgers.  Because you get mostly stems instead of the pepper itself."}
{"text":"Went in through the drive thru order a Memphis burger single medium meal and then another Memphis burger but a double medium meal   When I got home to eat before heading to work my fiance and I notice something weird about our food my burger was a western bacon burger and hers was just a pulled pork sandwich.  When I called the store to speak to a manager his attitude was like he didn't want to be bothered. I say this because when I made my complaint even after telling him I couldn't come back to the restaurant for a refund or a corrected order he told me to still come back.   The only decent service we got was from Jodie. I have no idea why this guy has such a funky attitude but it's noted that he doesn't take pride in his customer/guest service."}
{"text":"Drive thru is apparently not 24 hours. 4 out of 5 times they will tell you they are \"cleaning the charbroiler\" as soon as you pull up and that it will only take 15 mins.  On Friday morning (around 2am) I parked and decided to wait, and suddenly noticed the female worker leave the restaurant, get in her car, and leave. 20 mins later I realized there were no workers. This is not the first time it happened. It looks like some of your nightshift workers are taking off."}
{"text":"I quit going to this location because they could no longer make a beef, bean, and cheese combo burrito.  (It was always missing the beef, the manager indicated that some employees had trouble reading).  We also used to love the chicken tenders, but the last two times we had them they were dry and stale, even though we were told they were fresh.  (we stood there and watched them put the fresh ones in someone's order!)..Demanded and received a full refund."}
{"text":"Great to have another option when it comes to good fast food out here where we all know there aren't many diecent choices for food on this side of town, too many houses not enough retail. Anyway, I went during the first week they were open so this probably isn't the most accurate review seeing as I'm sure they had extra help in the begining, so I will check back and update later if neccesary. I was greeted immediately and it was very busy. The cashier was super friendly, and my food was placed in front of me on a tray before she even handed me my reciept! Like I said, first week open though. Needless to say, I was quite blown away though! Inside dinning room is very nice, great selection of Coca-Cola products inside, not much to hate! I do wish the drive-thru was open later though, it's only open til midnight Sunday-Thursday and til 2am on Friday, Saturday. I'd probably give it 5 stars if it had a 24 hour drive-thru like BK across the street, but not much to complain about aside from that. Great food!"}
{"text":"Great service. Will put you in agreat mood."}
{"text":"I ordered two Natural Burgers and I am happy to say that they were good and the service was quick and friendly. No complaints here."}
{"text":"This location on Losee has horrible customer service! I will never come here again the first time I had a horrible experience. This time was the worst. My Fiancé and I walked in at 8:30 to dine in and the first thing a the manager says to us is \"Uh no you can't eat in here our dining in is closed.\" Then she continued to say that they were closing at 9 and they are closing an hour early because only 3 people are working there. That was the rudest treatment ever, hire new people, or you will lose business."}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/2lb bacon western burger supposed to be piled high with applewood bacon all I got were 2 paper thin pieces of \"bacon\" 2 tiny onion rings and a burger that was larger than the spongy bun that is supposed to be baked fresh. Very disappointed for what I spent for this burger."}
{"text":"Walked in just before 10:30 pm and saw the waitress at the register grumble under her breath \"Yo dude, we bout to close...\"  Almost 40 minutes before closing time is not what I'd call \"bout to close\" but I think she was just upset that she had to put her phone away and actually work?  Plenty of places around this spot, choose somewhere else that appreciates your business."}
{"text":"I was staying in las vegas for a week and decided to stop by for a late night snack with a couple of my friends, and all i can say is DO NOT COME HERE, HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER STARVE THEN EVER COME BACK. The workers were one of the most rude people ive seen, one worker who, let me say \"took literally 30 minutes to give us 3 milkshakes \" showed so much attitude even though its her fault it took 30 minutes. All i can say is please stay away from this carls jr!"}
{"text":"Had a grilled chicken bbq sandwhich that was pretty decent for a grilled chicken piece.  Most placed they are over cooked but not here.  Basic sandwich but good flavor."}
{"text":"I am a fast food junkie.  I love fast food of the grossest varieties.  CARL'S JR ROCKS!  I ordered the Original Star Burger with Cheese.  It was so good - juicy, great toppings, slightly too much onion but I can survive that.  I enjoyed every bite of that burger.  I had criss-cut fries and a chocolate milkshake.  The fries were good when they first came out but started to go limp and floppy as they cooled - needs improvement.  The onion rings were dry and not very good.  The milkshake was amazing.  In fact, at this location there is a full milkshake BAR!  Overall, we had a fun Friday afternoon!  The line was long with people itching to try it out but it was not too difficult to find a seat as a lot of people were eating out.  The inside is a beautiful look at a modern fast food eatery.  Definitely pop in for a try.  A fast-food junkie's delight.  Just up your game on those sides, Carl Jr."}
{"text":"Please don't come to this location, for the past couple of years I always try to give them a try. Hoping maybe they would hire new people. The kids that work there are some crack addict high school drop outs I swear. My girl asked the guy for a sec while we looked at the menu, the guy said \"uhhhhh okay\" \" but there's a car behind you\". We literally just pulled up to the damn screen to order, plus wasn't even busy there was nobody there. Complete idiots, please avoid."}
{"text":"I used to come here a quite a bit. It's close to me, I've had to take a few things back due to error of food items ordered to given. I just had my worst and final bad experience. A kid named Lonzo handed me back my change, coins on top of bills but he didn't really hand it, just kind of not looking at my hand kind of handed it to me. I caught the bills but the coins went flying. He said ooops I'm sorry, giggled then shut the door. I actually wanted the coins this time. I might have let it slide most other times but this time I wanted them. So when he opened the door to give me my food,I asked him to replace the coins. He said I can't just take coins out of the register. I said, well your the reason they went flying. He said no it's not. I repeated I'd like the coins, I explained I would be contacting the main office. He shut the door. I honked my horn he looked and walked away still giggling. Another employee heard my horn and came over and opened  the door, asked what was the problem. I said I want my change. She opened the register and gave me the coins. I left. I will never go back. That was insane, rude, horrible service."}
{"text":"So, the service is terrible--and I'll just get that out there right away. However, about a week ago my husband and I went there somewhat late and what we experienced was far worse than any \"bad service\" that I had experienced at this restaurant prior. We waited in the drive thru for the guy to come on the intercom and take our order--he never did. My husband started yelling for the guy and he comes on and says \"no service for twenty minutes thank you\" and nothing else. I refuse to go there already because it takes FOREVER to get your food there and they do not care if they mess up. Now, even my husband refuses to go there because it is somewhat out of our way and now, we can't tell if we're going to get service."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an afternoon snack; thought I'd try one of their new sliders. I ordered one slider with no ketchup or onions and a medium drink. My wait time behind one car was ridiculously long. By the time they handed me my food, it was already cold and of course, with ketchup and onions on it. I parked and went inside, waited for the counter person to finish with the one other customer and showed her the problem. No apology, just took it and threw it away and shouted something unintelligible to the \"cook\". She made it wrong again, perhaps right condiments but not a slider. I watched her toast 2 slider buns and then put ketchup on both before clarifying what the order was supposed to be. I walked out and will NEVER be back. They didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave them. Never even an apology or offer to make things right."}
{"text":"My son and I came here on Friday night around 8pm. We had excellent service and the food was yummy. We had our order taken by Ana (00462) she kept the front lobby clean too."}
{"text":"Just had the best charbroiled chicken sandwich!! I've never had bad service here even when I come late.  Keep up the good work!! And keep the good food coming!!"}
{"text":"Drive thru botched order by not including straws or dipping sauces. Does that warrant a one-star? I dunno, it's just stoopid."}
{"text":"I don't know if your crew has problems multi tasking for of it's blatant disregard for the job they are supposed to be doing but ebery time I come to this location I have a problem with my order. I ordered a westren burger with onion straws instead of onion rings. They took 15 minutes to make my order and there was only one other person in the restaurant. When they brought me my burger there was onion RINGS on it. I brought it back and they lady in the back seemed annoyed about my request. Your crew is rude. Fire them all and get a new crew!"}
{"text":"Siobhan clearly doesn't know what a real ghetto is like. Try living in Southern Chicago or Bayview in SF.  Regardless, the people at this place are nice and yes, I got out of my vehicle to get food. The guy who helped me out let me use a \"Buy one get one free\" coupon for 6-dollar burgers on burgers that were not 6-dollar burgers. I.e. he let me use a coupon for something I wanted that was not eligible according to the coupon and saved me $5.50. Sweeeeeeeeet.  The food was delicious also.  I will be returning here as I have 7 more coupons. :)"}
{"text":"This Carls Jr. location is one of the best in the Las Vegas Valley. I stop in occasionally for breakfast and the restaurant is always clean, my meals are always hot and the cooks always practicing safety wearing gloves. Today, I stopped in and was greeted by an employee outside washing and sweeping the front entrance. I immediately said to myself, wow!!! If they take the time out to clean the outside of the restaurant then I know they are taking pride with the upkeep in the inside. This is a very safe place to eat and the employees seem very eager to uphold the standards. I hope more and more people give them a chance because this does not seem like a restaurant you will see on \"dirty dining\" anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this particular Carl's Jr. since they've opened. I'm not a regular but I just noticed something different...CLEAN !,  I mean, someone is always cleaning something and I'm impressed! The employees are mature and very service oriented."}
{"text":"It was A-OK.  Not super duper awesome, but still not bad.  I had never heard of Carl's Jr before so I thought I would check it out.  My first visit was for breakfast.  Yes, they have their growing pains.  I got in there at 7am and ordered my breakfast combo and they said it would be 15 minutes.  15 minutes turned into 35 minutes.  I felt bad for the cashier, she was so sweet but definitely looked nervous and uncomfortable.  But kudos to her for being so exceptionally sweet, she tried to make us happy even though breakfast was taking so long.  What had happened is that the night staff forgot to make the biscuits.  Ah, the problems of a new store opening, you have to give these new businesses a bit of a break, it's very difficult opening a new store with new staff, and especially a chain where not everybody knows what the choices are.  Customers are usually indecisive and asking a lot of questions so the time at the register is triple the time of a known fast food chain.  Anyways, back to breakfast, they gave me a free order of tater tots to compensate, which was delicious.  I was in such a rush after such a long wait, I accidentally took the other person's sandwich and ran out the door to get to work.  I had to go back and when I did they gave me the correct sandwich.  It was actually very good!  Sausage AND bacon, but I couldn't really taste the bacon because there were only a few thin slices, but it still tasted pretty good.  The coffee was horrible.  I hope they learn from McDonalds and invest a little more into their coffee and get a good strong Colombian coffee that is delicious, you guys are closer than McDonalds for some businesses and cheaper than Starbucks.  Get your coffee right and we will buy it from you instead of the competition.  I'll give their coffee another chance in a few months after they adjust a bit.    The one thing that was disturbing was watching the large tv while waiting for my order.  The only thing that was playing was Carls Jr commercials.  Ho-lee what a bunch of chauvinistic commercials!  All with scantily clad women, men that appear like losers staring at the women...very horrible commercials.  Totally unimaginative and meant to please and relate to the dumbest males ever.  I figured I should try their burgers before I write my review so I tried the Guacamole Bacon Thickburger.  The burger was 1/3 lb of meat, and it was actually quite juicy.  It tasted pretty good, but the bun was larger than the burger so the first few bites were just bread and onions, not awesome.  It was a bit of a mess eating it but it was a LARGE burger and also had fries and a drink.  It was over $11 so would I buy it again?  Probably not, I can buy a better meal for that price at the restaurants in the area.  Luckily, the TV had CP24 this time, much better.  Would I go back, well, yes but I would not buy a thickburger unless I hadn't eaten for a few days. I wouldn't mind trying their regular burger.  But I wouldn't come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My friends and I were on queen west one night, and the only place that hadn't closed yet was Carl's Jr.  None of us had been before but we figured why not try it out. It was the worst fast food we've ever had. Cold, weird flavour and tiny patties.  It was also obscenely overpriced. You could get two full combos at any other fast food joint for what it costs to"}
{"text":"Best Carl's Jr ever! We went here using the drive thru with our doggies and they gave us some milkbones for them.   Don't know the name of the person but thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for off the menu veggie burgers. I love this location because they are so accomidating to dietary needs or restrictions. The manager here is so sweet and happy to help! Very clean and always a great burger spot."}
{"text":"The young female running the drive thru is terrible at what she does. Burgers weren't as good as usual. The only reason I'm giving this location five stars is because we go to this place a lot and the guys that run the place are really friendly and make some bomb ass burgers"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Carl's Jr burgers and shakes since i was young. Even everything upgraded such as the decor,logos, etc. the taste of the patty is still delicious and juicy. I had the big carl, superstar, and teriyaki burger and i would highly recommend it. Prices that everyone can afford with an upscale service and portion and quality that you deserve."}
{"text":"We love coming here!! They know us and what we like :-) it's good some one can remember your order when it's complicated lol no bun low carb no fries with salad instead :-) I just love there staff!!! I've tried other places and this definitely is my #1 place!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience ever. Not only was my burger made wrong, I mean it was extremely difficult - mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce tomato and cheese. what did I get? Ketchup, 3 lousy pickles, a smidge of mustard and lettuce and tomato. The burger was also cold. And I don't mean warm, it was cold. Disgusting. I will never be back to this Carl's Jr. Maybe not to any of them."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon you would think they would have more than two people running the place.  I only went there to get to burgers and fries to go....   took a good 10 mins before my order was placed.   waited another 30 mins for my order to be finished.   will not be  eating this location again."}
{"text":"First time at Carl's in over 25 years. Ordered the Jalapeño Burger meal 1/3 pound for $9.95. While I waited I noticed music videos playing. Annoying to me but probably popular with most.   My lunch arrived in 4 minutes. The fries were  hot and crisp, the bun was fresh and the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, jalapeños) were all crisp and cool. I don't know what sauce they put on it but it complimented the sandwich perfectly.   I recommend this Carl's for quality food, fast, friendly service and good value."}
{"text":"It's odd that during all my travels in the U.S., I've never stopped in a Carl's Jr.  As much as I don't get to fast food burgers very often, variety is always welcomed.  Also like the variety of burgers offered, and more importantly sweet potato fries.  Albeit a little on the pricey side for quick serve.  Chic little spot with a separate shake bar in the fashionable Queen W.  Let's see if they manage to stick in the 6."}
{"text":"I was trying to write a review for my lunch but i had to keep stopping to go take a crap. I just had to try the $5 meal deal box. My fat ass had a double cheeseburger with the chicken sandwich, fries, soda and cookie. Not surprisingly, It tasted like a $5 meal too. Chicken sandwich was like a white sponge with breading. Like fried lunchmeat. Chicken tasted like  styrofoam but it went well with the globs of mayo. After i tackled that processed chicken, i ate some fries that were scattered throughout the box in no particular order. Good thing they werent in a bag or cardboard cup because that would make it presentable and we aint got time for that. So i go to unwrap my double cheeseburger and a tired ass looking burger pops out. Looked and tasted like they made it 6 hours ago hangin out under the heat lamp. Tasted like a double hockey puck sandwich. I think the best part of it was the ketchup. Next time i wanna play frisbee ill just stop at Carls and pull the burger out of the bun. The cookie was good. The soda was good...all 4 oz's. It was like 80% ice and 20% soda. I was actually impressed how one could get so much ice in a 12oz cup.   So anyway, in short, you get what you pay for.  Carls gets 2 stars for having a good clear speaker."}
{"text":"So I come to this location often because its 24 hours and because they always have milk shakes. But tonight the girl that was working said she wasn't going to make a shake even though they are 24 hours"}
{"text":"It's CJS! Food was crisp and warm and very friendly service. Not sure why everyone is acting like this place should be treated like some upscale fancy restaurant it's fast food and it's way better than any TV dinner to go home too. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I don't know why my review was taken down. I never received a freebie, had no connection to the owner or employees in fact if anything I was warning people to stay away.  Not that it matters at this point because the place is closed and good riddance to bad garbage.   Now, back to my review.  Back in September or October of 2015 I was downtown, had a day off and wanted to see a movie. My usual go to place for a good burger, BQM, had closed so I walked along to see what else there was. I saw Carl's Jr sitting there and had heard of the chain but had never ventured inside. So I had enough time and figured why not give it a shot.  I ordered, I believe the jalapeno thickburger along with fries and a drink. It was pricey at around $13.00 or so but figured if it's good it's worth it. I got my drink, took my number and sat down waiting for the burger to arrive.   I waited and I waited but nobody came. At one point a waitress did come by with a tray asking what I had ordered, I replied and she said this wasn't for me. She walked around the restaurant, couldn't find the person and the burger went back to sit under the heat lamp. Well about fifteen minutes later I'm pretty sure my burger ought to be ready by now. After all people that came in after me had gotten theirs and were finishing.   I walk up, speak to one of the counter staff and she pulls out the tray that's been sitting there for all this time. Yes, that was my burger but I'll be damned if I eat it now. I ask to speak to the manager to get my money back.  He offers to make me anything I want but I'm too pissed off right now to do anything about it. I ask for my money, he gives it to me and I drop off my comment card on my way out.  What a surprise, nobody contacted me concerning this. In fact even when I went to the comment section of the website and asked for somebody to call me back they never did.  This to me means two things. The first being that Carl's Jr doesn't care about it's Canadian customers. The second is that they were aware of the issues going on with the Toronto locations and didn't want to have to deal with them anymore. The fact that both stores closed in January of this year seems to point to the latter."}
{"text":"Welcome, please, thank you, how may I help you - there are all things you are unlikely to hear from their morning crew.  However, you may be ignored standing at the counter waiting to order or fell like a nuisance who dares interrupt them from doing whatever else they are doing.  They go through staff every few months and while this crew is some of the worst there is something wrong in upper management because this service is not uncommon there."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is absolutely amazing. They are always really friendly and never screw up my order - - things that are very important when it comes to fast food. Their Apple Walnut Chicken salad is amazing! I also crave their fried zucchini on a steady basis. Carl's Jr has some of the best fast food burgers out there... if you want something fast and GOOD then I think you should stop here."}
{"text":"WOW- Just saw a crazy lady shaking a sign for biscuits at Carls jr~!  Got one and it was goooooood!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite carls jr! I come in every once in a while to get my usual teryaki turkey burger with fries and a drink and service is always amazing. Even when i had to wait 10 minutes once i was apologized to and one of the ladies gave my little brother 2 free cookies and 2 hostess ice cream sandwiches for free. I didnt even complain about waiting. The lady with the long braided hair is always so friendly! Staff keeps good conversation and the restraunt is always clean. I live 12 minutes away from this location and i make the drive out just for the service! Definitly reccommend :)"}
{"text":"We've been to this location many times to eat because it is literally walking distance from our house. This was the most horrible service we had today. Our food was cold, and they pulled my husbands hot dog out of the microwave. I ordered a #8 guacamole bacon burger low carb style with no burger sauce, I got a regular cheeseburger low carb style and when I returned it the manager asked what happened? She said was the guacamole bacon and I said that's what it was supposed to be. I waited a few minutes and she came back with another burger which sad to say was made the exact same way the first one was made...Wrong! I didn't send it back a second time because I was too hungry to continue waiting, I just ate it. The entire crew was a hot mess, no communication at all. I hope they get it together so they don't lose anymore customers. $40 worth of crappy food isn't ok."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Low Carb Thickburger.   I'm not a fan of buns...I can do a roll (something like a kaiser or brioche) but hate hamburger and hotdog buns for some reason.   That being said, I was feeling so miserable today with a cold I figured I'd give Carl's Jr. a try for this no-bun-Thickburger.   It is a half lb burger with all the fixings wrapped in iceberg lettuce. My burger was huge (not much of a difference in price between .3 lbs and .5 so I got greedy). I thought it would be 2 or 3 of a standard size burger patties but it's actually a single juicy patty- this was a nice surprise. The veggies we're crisp and delish and they were nice and cold in contrast to the hot burger.   Note this burger and most items on the menu we're more expensive than other fast food places. I don't do a lot of fast food but I liked this burger. It was $7+ but worth it to me given that the burger was good."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Had a 1/3 pound thick burger,  onion rings and a chocolate shake. Around $16. Burger and rings both tasted like they had been cooked hours ago and were served to me lukewarm. Chocolate shake was good accounting for both of the stars. I was there around 11:00 pm so perhaps that was the problem?"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I just got a deal on my biscuits & gravy meal and didn't even realize it or say thank you!!!  So to that young man that hook me up on my meal this morning Thank you   I haven't ate at Carl's Jr. in years so I am filling my belly up with some freshly baked biscuits and gravy and some French toast stick, which by the way it is Delicious!!!  You may have won a new loyal customer!!  Thank you for blessing me this morning"}
{"text":"For fast food it's pretty clean inside, and the employees are very friendly. The food comes out pretty quickly and their orders were very accurate.would recommend  for a quick stop on the way home while kids are screaming in the car, and the juice stain is still setting into your t shirt. They will get your food correct the first time so you can slam on the gas of your mini van and ride off into the sun set!"}
{"text":"Any place that is willing to lose a customer by charging for condiments that likely cost less than 5 cents does not value its customers nor does it warrant your business.  Something is VERY wrong at Carl's Jr...  These are despicable buffoons who should not work with the public.  I hope that the owner is well invested in other ventures.  Business practices such as these do not promote and retain customers.  Do yourself a favor and look for more pleasant surroundings.  Yelp lists many good restaurants nearby that do not charge for condiments and who treat their customers like they're glad to see them."}
{"text":"I will never eat anywhere where they charge for their condiments.  This place lost a customer who spent over $100 per week there over their insistence to charge for ranch dressing.  These are despicable people with their hands in your pockets.  Find a better place  to eat.  There is good food nearby with friendly service.  This place is not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Any place that wants to charge extra for enough condiments to eat the meal is petty to the extent that they do not warrant my business.  Lose this dump and find some GOOD food...  Yelp lists many business nearby that value their customers and do not charge extra for condiments.  Any business that chooses to lose a customer who spends over $100 per week there over condiments that cost them less than 5 cents is not likely to be in business for long anyway.  Let the buyer beware, there is something VERY wrong at Carl's Jr..."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for the first time, food was delicious, and the pretty girl behind the counter, Leah, was funny and wonderful. I'm glad we came. Best customer service I have had in a while. Will be back soon. :)"}
{"text":"Slow service.  There were four people working but really only one. I waited in line for way to long and waited for my food way to long. One guy messed around filling trash cans instead of helping. Boo!!!"}
{"text":"I do love Carl's Jr breakfast sandwiches! It seems that the chances of actually getting what I order through the drive-through at this location is about 50/50, at best, though. I decided to give them another try this morning and ordered two different biscuit sandwiches. It took several minutes to receive my order but I was prepared for the wait due to past experience. I immediately checked the contents of my bag (also due to past experience) and noticed that I was given one biscuit and one burrito. I handed the bag to the associate and told her that I ordered two biscuits. She then told me that I ordered what I was given. I showed her the receipt on which she had rung my order correctly at which point she corrected my order.  TL;DR: If you want to wait too long for fast food, get served the wrong food, and then be told that you're to blame for the mistake, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever seen at a fast food restaurant.  We stopped in for a quick burger.  It took us almost 5 minutes at the register to be acknowledged.  Bear in mind, there was a party of 3 who were eating, and a party of 5 who ordered at some point before us.  Ordered 2 combo meals... 18 minutes later, I walked back to the counter.  The General Manager was the woman who took  our order.. and she was ALSO COOKING THE FOOD.  A grand total of 3 employees were present on a Friday night at 5:00pm.  One was handling the drive-thru orders, the general manager was working the front registers and helping a brand new person cook the food.  We got our burgers after I waited another 2 or 3 minutes at the counter.  Mine was the wrong order.  The GENERAL MANAGER asked the brand new cook what the wrapper looked like for the one I ordered.  While all of this is going on, the party of 5 who ordered before us informed the GM that she had been waiting 22 minutes for 2 milkshakes.  The GM's reply was \"yeah, we have 15 ordered right now, we'll get to it\".    I understand understaffing to save some money, but no apology, nothing.   And the restaurant had a total of 3 parties including us.   The GM had the personality of wallpaper and offered nothing in the way of an apology.  I will go to In 'n Out burger across the street next time.  The GM should be fired."}
{"text":"Came here because I was getting my car worked on near by. Very friendly and attentive staff, customer service was A++ and the food was good as well. Definitely above average for a fast food spot."}
{"text":"I have to give a star rating or else I wouldn't. The wait time is so long in the mornings. 15 minutes in line and still not by the window. It's a fast food and they they take there sweet time. Don't come here for something quick before work!"}
{"text":"Okay, it's a fast food franchise, but it's convenient and they know me. i always pick up a juicy burger after my workout on my way home and they give me doggy treats for my pups. Yes, if you didn't know this its the only fast food franchise that i know of that gives doggy treats, but you got to ask. Lately, they've been giving me chocolate chip cookies that are really good i think it must be some seasonal promo. They are Yummy! =)"}
{"text":"We dined in and it took 12 minutes to get 3 combo meals. And we were the only customers!  This place was ssslllloooowwww."}
{"text":"This location is just down the street from me but I prefer to drive the distance to the location on 95th ave. Tables were dirty and don't sit until you wipe the seats. Bath rooms smelled and looked like they were clean by a twelve year old. Three of the \"employees\" need to go back to grade school because Carl's jr just is not there thing. Air was hot  103* outside 90* inside = fun dining.  The fish sandwich and hamburger were thrown together like a tossed salad and I had to wait to fill my drink, no ice in the machine. Overall rating- stop at Jack in the box or McDonald's."}
{"text":"Thank you, Carl's for cooking me dinner. It's no prime rib, but your BBQ western burger makes me happy. This location is close go work so I'll Karen swing know at lunch and pick up food for myself and my Coworker and kg keeps us going all day. A bit pricey for dash food but it's satisfying. Just check your drink before you leave, they get it wrong half of the time which is annoying after you've left!"}
{"text":"The food is good. BUT, for the last year or so every single time we have gone through the drive-thru the employees who take the orders have bad attitudes. The wait at the window to pay, get drinks and food is just atrocious. And the crappy attitudes add to the frustration."}
{"text":"I feel like a heel reviewing fast food. I mean, it's fast food. Still, you expect to get what you pay for, right? First, to be honest, the food wasn't terrible. It wasn't great, but probably about what you should expect. But it took 15 minutes to get a burger. The drive thru was snaked around the building, so I went inside. 15 minutes standing at the counter. Meanwhile, they have music videos playing and they were NOT family friendly. Ariana Grande may want to be \"loved harder,\" but kids don't need to hear that, and they certainly don't need to see it. Since I was there for so long, I got to see four of these videos, and three of them were sexually explicit. In summary, the food was no better than McDonald's. It certainly wasn't any less expensive than normal fast-food fare. But I could have done without the in-your-face reminder that our society is circling the bowl."}
{"text":"Went for a late night milkshake with my friend.The guy who took our order was very nice & helpful.  We shared the s'mores shake which was good but very sweet. We weren't able to finish it, but agreed we would try another flavour next time."}
{"text":"Not big fast good eaters but when we do, this is our spot! Burgers and crisscut fries are always and point but what keeps us coming back is the customer service!! We'll come pretty late but the service is always EXCELLENT!! They're so sweet here EVERY TIME we visit :):)"}
{"text":"For you carls jr fans this is the one this franchise has thee best service and thee hottest food of any carls jr i have been to in vegas. All other franchises should follow the example set here, oh yeah the restrooms are cleanest i have seen (on this part of town) lol"}
{"text":"Such friendly service. I've never been to a Carl's Jr. Where they smiled and were personable. The manager even came over to chat (should've asked his name). Another employee came over to see how we were doing and if ee needed anything else. You usually don't get such attentive service at fast food places."}
{"text":"Went in today and ordered an all natural burger with no ketchup or mayo but yes on the mustard and add jalapenos and bacon.       My relative ordered the jalapeno burger with bacon and the crispy onions like on the steakhouse, no jalapeno sauce , add mustard.       We get our food and mine has no mustard but a TON of ketchup on each bun. My relatives had so much mustard on both sides that she couldnt even taste anything but mustard and her onions were regular onions and not the crispy ones she asked for.       We took the food back to the front to the ***manager***, I told him I was suppose to have mustard not ketchup and my relative said hers had WAY too much mustard and the onions werent the crunchy ones.       He was like, \"well thats the normal amount of mustard we put on there and bla bla bla we have to put it in a swirl...yea but not on both buns and NOT about 2 table spoons on each bun! So he had them made again.       We got our food 20 minutes after ordering and he came back over and was like saying to us again , \"remember next time when you want mustard...\" I cut him off and I was like,   \"mine still has no mustard period, can you believe it was still wrong? and hers had the same regular onions and not the crunchy again.....\" I am not going to have a ***manager*** who cant even just listen the first time and then still grill me like its my relatives fault hers was drenched like someone dipped it in a bucket. We never said extra extra extra mustard.   Just because she said no ketchup and no mayo doesnt mean I want all of those in one fat amount of mustard. Flat out worst service. He did give us back our money BUT he asked to kept the receipt so he could \"learn\" which is BS because I cant even call corporate with the receipt # and he knows it.   I will never go back here  Oh and P.S. the food was cold and after being spoken to like it was my fault I wasnt even hungry."}
{"text":"Burgers are not too bad and ok value for your money, however I find the young staff here really annoying and miserable. Its a pity to see unhapy kids working at a place they must despise because thay never say 'thank you' EVER after placing an order and look rushed and disinterested when you place an order."}
{"text":"I popped in here yesterday morning around 1030 hoping to get some kind of morning biscuit or something but this  Carls Jr. doesnt have breakfast ( some locations do) . However, I decided what the heck - I would get something. Now being a vegetarian at Carls isnt that good - but I recall that what they do have is good.  I opted for the onion rings - they rivalled A&W for the crunchy fresh breaded style - unlike the dreadful kind you get at Harveys.  The staff that helped me were so friendly and nice - really fun and down to earth.  The decor inside is cool and dynamic - lots or red - padded booths with nods to California and Los Angeles. A real cool slick feel to the place.  Outside they cement picnic tables - no doubt a franchise thing - I have to wonder how they will look at the end of a Calgary winter - they will likely require a repaint!  Anyhow - I had a good experience, and despite the lack of vegetarian offerings - I would go back for fries or onion rings - oh yes! the gravy for the poutine is vegetarian  ( they told me that) ,"}
{"text":"The service here is very good! The lady this morning is always delightful. I tried the new California burger and it was amazing for fast food! Came with double the meat, double the cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and thousand island sauce! Chris got two breakfast burgers and they were huge! They're definitely worth $4. They were very delicious as well!"}
{"text":"It drives me nuts how dirty this place is.  Hardly anyone in the restaurant yet every table is dirty and sticky.  I prefer to drive through.  The teriyaki burger on fresh made bun is delicious.  I love that they have fresh brewed iced tea and the largest size (bigger than McDonalds) is only 79 cents.  Kids like that they have strawberry fanta soda.  Play area.  Try a chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Food here is ok, but the staff sucks! Came in for breakfast and I waited at the counter for at least 2 minutes before someone even noticed I was there! The Hispanic girl who came out of the back room seemed bothered by me making her work. The entire interaction made me feel like I was a nuisance! I know not to expect much from fast food workers, but this was enough to make me yelp review hoping to catch some attention by management and let the public know not to expect good service at this this Carl's jr."}
{"text":"For the price I paid, I could have gone to a real burger joint.  Had the Western Burger (thin flat patty, soggy onion rings, 2 sad looking slices of bacon on a limp sesame bun) and poutine (so disappointing, not good).  Tried it once and will not be back."}
{"text":"Place was mostly clean.  We walked in to the restaurant being in the middle of cleaning but the two employees we saw were behind the registers.  Nobody was cleaning.  Chairs were moved around and blocking most the tables in their island.  Food was okay, nothing fancy.  Takes care of the hunger.  Service was bleh.  This Carl's Jr is right across the Home Depot parking lot.   First three panels are just for Breakfast but they weren't serving any.  It didn't sound like it was available all day but it sure was the first thing we could see when looking at the menu."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars, I would. Everything is a mess in there, nothing is cleaned. You feel dirty when you go in. DON'T GO IN THERE!!"}
{"text":"Out of all the fast food places this is my favorite. The food is actually really good for the prices. Don't expect a gourmet meal. Like some people do. The staff is very polite and courteous, they always get my order right."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest carls junior i have ever been too.   The staff is great amd service is fast. The food tastes excellent."}
{"text":"The strawberry lemonade is always a good choice on a hot Las Vegas day ! Plus the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Consistently has kiss running the place. Heard cook using the \"F\" word one night while ordering. Food is constantly incorrect from what is ordered. Never enough employees."}
{"text":"One of the worst locations I've ever been to. Better off driving a little further to the one next to the Big Lots & Craig Ranch Park. The lady that took the order was rude and cut us off multiple times. SMH."}
{"text":"Stopped by to burn some time while my car was being washed. There was a customer in front trying to pay for his meal. Lancelot (cashier) was trying to take payment but the register malfunctioned and was not accepting debit/credit cards. The young lad was understanding and said he didn't have cash so to have the order cancelled. I stopped forward and paid for his meal and for my spicy chicken sandwich. The head cashier (didn't get her name) added her employee discount to the order.    This single event was all in the kindness of our hearts. This is how you make America Great Again!"}
{"text":"Although they have good service, the food was absolutely tasteless. We ordered the California burger and the spicy chicken, the food took a while and we're here bcz we're in a hurry! The Calis came out just warm but the spicy chicken was hot enough. Although the Cali burgers have grilled onions and thousand island sauce on them, they were plain TASTELESS! I do not understand how a whole burger has no taste of any thing although it has double patties and double cheese and toppings! The spicy chicken was not too bad for a $1!  I've had Carl's Junior before and it was fine, this is the first time however I have a whole meal at a fast food chain and it tastes literally like nothing!   Also, it says on the door that the restaurant is open until 11:00pm every night except for one night (where they close at 10:30pm, can't remember which night this was). Today it's supposed to be open until 11:00pm and the waitress said they were closing their doors in a few minutes at 9:55pm! At least she was nice about it but what are the hours?! If they have changed them, they need to change the sticker on their door!  I am sooooo disappointed I ate here. You do not expect much from fast food chains but this was probably my worst experience in a very long time! Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"Over the years, their burgers are like cardboard and the rest of the food has total gone down hill.  They just opened a new location in Henderson on Stephanie St.......that just isn't cutting it.  Now the Farmer Boys is opening soon..........Carl's will be dust.    That's what happens when the corporate suits take over and turn it into a bottom line loser and take the quality away.  Keep it up guys.......!!"}
{"text":"This only gets two stars because I love Carl's Jr. This one really lacks in everything. Cold food, crappy service. But, I keep going, not sure why."}
{"text":"Discontinued the loaded omelette biscuit. There is no reason to put up with terrible service from a filthy fast food place no different than any other. This chain needs to fix more than the attitudes of their entitled employees. I won't be returning to any Carl's Jr. or Hardee's ever again."}
{"text":"I been eating here off and on over the last 15 years but I wouldn't call myself a regular.  They have great burgers, fries and shakes.  They are a great value.  They also have a humongous breakfast sandwich.  I feel guilty eating her sometimes hahaha.  I probably eat Carl's Jr 1-3 times a year.  Carl's Jr is A-OK!  P.S. Try their Bacon Gucamole Western Angus Burger the burger itself is $6 but the meal is oly $8.75 after taxes."}
{"text":"i showed up at 11:45pm. i know they are going to close soon. i pulled up to the fully lit order menu, wait 2 minutes and no answer. i pull up to the window and no one is by the window. i see cars in front of the building. as i pull around i see someone move from inside. i then pull around back to the order menu. no answer after another 2 minutes. i pull out and as i turn i see another person sitting there watching me pull out. i stop and look right at the man in a red shirt. i will never go back. if your hours of opperation are until 12am, then they should be open until 12a. it is a sad place that shuts down 15 minutes before official closing."}
{"text":"#3 is the bomb.  Western burger combo with crosscut fries. If it has to be fast food this is on the list."}
{"text":"It's a typical fast food burger place... food is just fine. This is my local place and I like it because the staff is friendly and the bathrooms are clean and when you review fast food places, to me, the customer service and the cleanliness is what makes a difference from other places."}
{"text":"Laziest and incompetent staff...they can't get even execute the most simplest order, correctly.  I've always enjoyed Carl's Jr.'s low carb offerings...this location can't be bugged to wrap a burger in lettuce...Kya, Server 000487, you suck."}
{"text":"tldr  Honestly not a fast food kind of guy but needed something quick in the neighborhood. Service was outstanding, interior was nice and clean. But brah, we ordered a large combo with one of the sandwiches and they literally only gave us 3 onion rings. It's a new location so hopefully they'll get their stuff together.  Got: -the big chicken fillet sandwich; no mayo"}
{"text":"If your not open 24/7 like it says online, you guys should really update your hours. I went around 11:30pm on 04/27 and it was closed but you said you were open."}
{"text":"Ok ... so I was on my way over to the Ben Avery shooting range ... and stopped in here for breakfast.  I know - I didn't review well before - but I was looking for a bite before heading out into the sun.  Couldn't decide what to order - and asked Cody for assistance.  Cody was the cashier - and steered me to the (I believe it was) loaded breakfast burrito.  The food was great - and I left satisfied.  The key to this review, and the reason for the added stars - was Cody.  What a helpful, pleasant, professional, hard working guy!  I hope the manager/owner of the location is paying him well - he's an asset to the business.  I'd hire the guy on the spot - he didn't stop working - the whole time I was there, and couldn't have been more pleasant to customers.  Great job Cody!"}
{"text":"Very very surprised and the quality of food. Wasn't expecting much and would gladly buy this food more often. Only complaint was the price is higher then most places but you get what you pay for in quality and freshness"}
{"text":"Wasted ~30 mins at the drive thru at night just for the Diablo burger and some fries. Seriously?! This is unacceptable. They basically just have one dude there doing everything so that's why it took forever!  Oh and they didn't even give me ketchup with the fries... Fail! Never again!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.... I hate to say it, but McDonald's is better ! Soggy, sloppy, mess! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Clean.  Good service.  Good carls experience."}
{"text":"Uh. Just no... entered this place and first impression was it was vacant and filthy.  Glass on doors and windows was disgusting. There were only two patrons in the dining area, and no one waiting to order, yet there were at least 5-6 tables that desperately needed to be wiped down and sanitized.  The employees were more interested in chatting than helping my hubs an me at the counter, so we left. We likely avoided some sort of food borne illness. I went to school with a few of the grandkids of Carl Karcher, the original owner and founder of Carl's Jr.  I can tell you, if he were still alive, heads would be rolling for this poor representation of his good name."}
{"text":"It's like people don't even remember what customer service was because it's been so long since anybody's gotten some from anywhere. I'd say that would be an excuse for these people except for that the lady who serve me was about 68 years old talked like she was reading from a script yet everything she said also seems very made up. I'm not gonna say that she got my order wrong however sitting there for 15 minutes then getting home to eat it it tasted like the food had been sitting underneath a heat lamp for an hour or so so I'm unsure as to why I was forced to wait 15 minutes in the drive-through."}
{"text":"I stopped at this location of Carls Jr. for thr Baby-Back Rib Burger, but unfortunately I was told they no longer make them. So, I settled for their signature Famous Star Burger w/cheese combo.  What I received for my 6 bucks and change was a smashed up, mayo filled mess that they threw together... I ordered super heavy pickles, and they gave me three. Needless to say, the burger was a sloppy, disgusting, mayo globbed disaster. The only positive thing here was the fries, they were hot  My normal experience ar Carls Jr. is much more pleasant than this, it's this particular location that is the problem. The building is old and outdated, and the employees here seem like they just dont care.   Skip this location and save your Carls Jr. craving for next time."}
{"text":"This is NOT a Green Burrito location. But they have good burgers and decent customer service."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. is my office away from the office Monday thru Friday. I come here to read my IBD and grab something to eat. I love the french toast and when I'm feeling really cheap I get the Sunrise Croissant for a buck. The croissant comes with eggs, sausage and american cheese (I request pepperjack instead). Lately the Sunrise has not been agreeing with me so I guess I'm stuck with the french toast for now on. So come by and say hello if you're in the area before 8:30."}
{"text":"We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good.  I had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops.  My wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing.  She also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Love coming to a 24 hour location to be refused service for cleaning.... Can't stop mopping the lobby to take the order? Swear the people at this establishment get lazier and lazier."}
{"text":"I love Carl's Jr. I got the best charbroiled burger here. I think it was the Famous Star burger. I wish they had it in NY but oh well. Definitely check it out if you are in the area/West coast."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the brother and ordered through drive thru. Although the car in front of us took awhile to get there order, the workers at the drive thru window were very kind and kept apologizing for the inconvenience. Im surprised because I always have bad luck with customer service but everyone here had positive vibes that night. Good job!"}
{"text":"On 1-16-2017 wanted to order a chicken salad. They said they didn't have any chicken patties for the salad or for the sandwiches. This was around noon time. Seriously! Ended up going around the street to Burger King."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait 20 min at the drive thru. I was so upset when I had just ordered a milk shake and I was irate by the time I got to the window and said \" \" I dont want it you guys took way too long\" that is RIDICULOUS 20 min in a drive thru, it was around 530pm typical young staff who are lazy. Never going back. Horrible! Horrible!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Carl's Jr! This one is not to far from my work, I was actually looking for the Puerto Rican food restaurant in the same strip mall. Since they were closed I went ahead and ate at CJ's!! Just like any of their franchise, food is good, never been a fan of their fries! CJ's is always adding to their menu, so you need to look at it once in awhile. You might miss something you might like!!! I had their Memphis Burger! This beast consist of: hamburger pattie, pull pork, onion rings, and bbq sauce. You have an option to add another pattie if you want, but you don't need to!!! Burger was great, loved the fusion of all the flavors! Service was great, they were training a new worker when they took my order. This location seem to have  a lot more seats! Lots of room!! Area is not that great, but this is a nice location!!"}
{"text":"Slow... unorganized... unprofessional.   It took an excessive amount of time just to be asked if we could be helped. Our order took almost 10 minutes to fill. And one employee was openly reprimanding another about him not being aware of his schedule in front of guests."}
{"text":"The worst Carl's Jr. in the city. Rude drive through operator. Just crap! Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Carl's has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6. The big marketing ploy here was that you could get a burger for just a few dollars that was the same quality as what other places charge $6 for. Not anymore. Additionally, they have not resolved the issue of employees that speak so little English that they are unable to either take or execute your order correctly. We have emailed Carl's in the past regarding this issue and are just tired of having to bring it to their attention when they get the order wrong (which is most times now).  We have now decided to just go across the street to the In N Out burger at Fiesta Mall for any future burger runs. You can get a burger for half the price and the employees speak English and can get your order right."}
{"text":"I love the $6 Guac/bacon cheeseburger, and the ice cream cookie sandwich...but that's it. If ordering chicken in the drive thru...expect to wait...and wait."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. The customer service is absolutely terrible. They are always chatting rather than taking your order. When they are \"ready\" to take your order, they NEVER hear it the first time. It's so incredibly frustrating."}
{"text":"I have never been more disgusted with a fast food place as I am with this one. We rarely buy out but we love a good meal from Carl's Jr. However, this was the wrong one to go to. They don't give Vet discount like the one on Country Club South of 60. We drove through, the order taker seemed to be in a hurry because I had to ask her to let me finish my order before I was finished. But she did get it right as shown on the receipt. However, they put the burgers on top of the fries, and one burger was not wrapped right so when we pulled it out of the bag it fell apart all over inside the items in the bag...mustard etc. smeared everywhere and she put cheese on it. I drove back and went inside this time. The person re-making the burger I guess does not understand no cheese, no mayo and extra onion is two slices to them. I had to keep asking the counter person to tell the girl making the burger to put the extras on, I even ask if I could go back there and make it myself. Then we got home. The meat was dry, burnt and tasteless. I will never go to that location again. I'll spend my $19 for 2 burgers and 2 fries elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I placed my order for $5.00 meal deal. Got home and I was given a spicy chicken instead of cheeseburger. I called and the young lady who helped me answered and I explained my situation. Her response was \"I'm sorry I was in a hurry to close and I accidentally grabbed a spicy chicken I remember you\". She asked for my name and stated I'm not there tomorrow but come back and we'll replace it.\"  She didn't tell me that I would have to have my receipt for proof. I went back tonight and was told they did not have anything that said they owed me anything. I told them to call the young lady and I insisted again that they call her the kid waiting on me said he did and she vaguely remembers me. The kid states we have a notice up front about a woman trying to get free food. I immediately said listen I make over 100,000 a year do you honestly feel I would try to steal a 5.00 meal from you. I reinforced that their customer service was in deep trouble. I have always enjoyed Hardee's/Carl Jrs but I will boycott this franchise and do what is necessary to let others know what a joke this is. I asked for franchise owners contact info and they refused to give it to me. This is the Carl Jrs located at Warm Springs and Durango Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both drive thru. I ask for famous star trim it style, it's on the menu and I've been getting it for quite sometime. However first time I was here the employee had no idea what I was talking about and kept saying low carb, no that's not what I want. Finally after forever I got the order I wanted. Tonight I did same thing only this time the girl at drive thru was very rude. I said trim it she said low carb. I said no, trim it with no cheese or mayo. In a rude abrupt voice she says \"ok fine I got it here's your total.\" Wow. Never again will I go to this location."}
{"text":"The staff was poorly trained.  So poorly, in fact, that the counter crew person had no idea how to enter my coupon in their POS system.  It took both her and the manager more than 10-minutes just to enter my order properly!  At least the meal was good."}
{"text":"OMG horrendous!  Drive thru - \"would you like to try our new cod fish sandwich?\"  Me: Yes! No sauce.   Drive thru - mumble mumble mumble  I wait a minute...nothing. I decide to drive ahead since no one is in the drive thru and only 2 cars in the lot.   Drive thru - Yeah?  Me: I ordered the cod no sauce.   Drive thru yells my order to the back and charges $4.52 and \"forgets\" to return the change.   Received sandwich which was so disgusting I threw it out. Bun was as stale as a rock and you couldn't tell the difference between the bun & the fish."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Dark, Uninviting Upon entering this Carl's Jr. on a Saturday, the lighting was very dark. It was a very cold atmosphere, literally and figuratively. The two entrance doors at the south side of the building took a very long time to close. I tried pulling them shut, but doing so met with a lot of resistance. This resulted in a cold draft sneaking in from time to time. I couldn't sit at the high table without feeling a gust of wind at my back every few minutes.  Service: Not Very Fast for \"Fast food\" My order was served to me 13-15 minutes upon ordering, which was quite slow for a \"fast food\" joint, in my opinion.  Food: Not bad at all! I ordered the Teriyaki Turkey Burger and the All Natural Burger with a side of fries and a small drink. The fries were good; crispy, hot, delicious with ketchup on them. The Teriyaki Turkey Burger had decent flavor. It was served with teriyaki sauce and a slice of pineapple. It was very messy to eat and the bun, in my opinion, was too small for such a burger. The All Natural Burger tasted just like any other burger, but without the guilt. This burger was advertised to be all-natural and non-GMO (I think?). Tasted just fine, but the red onion was just a little overpowering the rest of the burger.  Overall: Good for quick bites on the go The price of the meal I got was about $14. This is a small combo with another burger. This not a bad price at all for what I got. I just wished that the service was a little faster."}
{"text":"I work in the Food and Beverage industry and I know that this shouldn't happen even in fast food restaurants. Plain  boring order taker with no hat, messy hair and no name tag . After the order was taken we had gone to the table and sat but the table was filthy! There were like 5 tables not wiped down and floors not swept. I went over to ask the cashier for a sanitized towel and I saw the bucket on the counter. (Shouldn't it be on the floor?). Then she said to me \"ok I'll be right over\".I think she was the supervisor because she had a different shirt than the rest of them. I'm thinking she would be generous on giving me the towel because she was attending to another guest. I waited 5 more minutes for her to come by. Then she sends another person to wipe the table. Funny thing is that observing that there was more than one table that needed to be wiped she only wipes ours. LAZY!!!! They were not busy at all. Then they brought us our food and the fries were cold and the burger was awful!! The meat was hard and tasteless.My husband and I could hear the staff just messing around in the back. There was kid without a uniform just standing there looking over that small counter by the soda machine just smiling. After all my observation the lobby looked like crap. Staff, no sense of urgency to do a lobby check or sweep the whole time we were there. Fountain machine full of spills and the restroom with no soap to wash our hands with. Thinking to my self if there isn't any soap how would the staff was their hands after using the restroom??. Pretty gross!! As we left we saw the same kid with his uniform on this time but his uniform was so wrinkled. Did not look professional just looked really sloppy! 1. I didn't eat my food like I mean it. 2 the star lost its shine! This place really sucked and I will not be back! I give it a 1 star.  Who ever is the store manager of this store should really do some retraining or hire better people who is going to take their job seriously even when their bosses are not looking."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Carl's for years and they have always been pretty good as fast food burger joints go for sure. The Western Bacon Cheeseburger is very good, the Grilled Barbeque Chicken sandwich is likewise delicious and the Cross-cut Fries are an excellent accompanyment for Carl's burgers. Lately though I've fallen in love with Carl's Turkey Burger. I've been trying to make the occasional \"healthy choice\" and this burger fits the bill when I need to grab something on the fly. This sandwich is served on a toasted whole wheat bun with plenty of lettuce, tomatoes and onions and a deliciously juicy turkey patty. Turkey patties tend to get somewhat dry when cooked, but Carl's does a good job of keeping the burger moist and succulent. If you're trying to eat health this burger is a great place to start.  BTW, this location is great! I use the drive-thru here with great regularity and the service is excellent. The location is very convenient, near the intersection of Rainbow and Westcliff and they are generally not too busy."}
{"text":"The staff definitely has a problem understanding English.  I had a coupon for \"free jalapeno thickburger with the purchase of ANY thickburger\".  I tried to order the basic thickburger and get the free jalapeno one, but the young latina girl could not comprehend and tried to charge me for a jalapeno thickburger.  She finally called a female latina supervisor over who had little more grasp of English and said she could give me a senior discount which would make it less than the price of the BOGO jalapeno thickburger they charged me for.  I gave up and settled for that.  It wasn't worth the hassle.  I will say I like their sausage and egg biscuits in the morning, and I've never had a problem getting that order correct."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Carl's Jr.  I have a love/hate realtionship with Carl's Jr.  Let's face it Carl's Jr  is on the way to everywhere  you go, so that makes Carl's Jr very convenient and the prices are reasonable.  Today I thought I would try the Chorizo, Egg, and Cheese Buritto. The Chorizo, Egg & Cheese Burrito has spicy chorizo, scrambled eggs, shredded Jack and cheddar cheeses, fried Hash Round Nuggets, and pico de gallo salsa. The ingredients are proportioned well, and the burrito was tasty, especially for a fast food burger joint.  Overall, I think the Chorizo, Egg & Cheese Burrito was good.  Oh yeah.. the Chorizo, Egg, and Cheese burrito only cost  $3.49 but you can make it a combo meal with Hash Rounds and choice of drink for  $4.99. You might want to swing by Carl's and give it a try."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're just getting off I-10 and looking for a good burger joint. Their service is very good and their people are friendly and accomodating. The location is close by not just the freeway, but close to IKEA and other stores and shops.   Their menu gives many delicious options and combos, as well as value items and side items. They score big with me also because they have Coke Zero. Always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Service is pretty decent as well, but the food is what lures me to return. I got the $5 All Star Box on this visit, which mine had the Chicken Tenders, fries, cookie, & I upsized my Coke Zero being i was very thirsty at the time.   Good, fast, reliable, & accommodating are what I describe this location as."}
{"text":"I'm never big on fast food, but I sometimes find myself here. Love that I can get any burger or sandwich protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of inside a bun). Enjoyable, guys!"}
{"text":"I came here because I've been to one in Los Angeles and had fond memories wig It.  Unfortunately it was completely different and I will not be returning.  Food: 1/5, I got this monster looking burger with way too many jalapeños.  The cheesy fries were the worst I've ever had - just weird shredded cheese with Taco Bell meat sauce.     It was also super greasy in a bad way.  Service: 3/5, this was weird.  The menu was super confusing and even the cashier couldn't explain how much things would cost (like combo or single or upgrade etc.) It was although nice to have them being the food to us.  Ambience: 3/5, nice decor and a great restaurant layout overall  Price: 2/5, really overpriced for fast food. We all spent like $15+ here (rather go to a real restaurant)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by noting that I absolutely adore Carl's Jr! They make the best chain burger in the country and the lack of Carl's Jr in my current city of Cleveland,OH is enough to send a man into a deep depression.   However, since this review is for this specific location, I have to overlook my fondness for CJ to say that this is perhaps one of the most poorly run fast food restaurants I have ever been to. I used to work near this location so this is coming from regular visits to this specific store.   The staff are unfriendly (bordering on rude) and the service is slower than molasses in January. More often than not they get the order wrong as well.   So, as much as I love CJ, a short trip to a different location is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good, dependable food. I just love their fish tacos & jalapeño peppers. These are so yummy. The people here are super nice & friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I used to love Carl's Jr. but it seems every time I go here, my chicken tenders are luke warm and chewy like they've been sitting out for a while and dried out. Not to mention I spent $9+ on a meal only to discover my tenders were smaller than my fries. Not worth my money or my time. #regret"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and it's always disappointing. It's the only thing on my drive home that's open late at night, so I continue to go back. Tonight at 1:45 am I sat in the drive-thru with no response. Called out several times and nothing. Drove through the drive-thru and I see the worker just standing there staring at me through the window... great service. I'll never be back. Went to jack in the box instead... I prefer Carl's but doesn't do me any good if I can't get food"}
{"text":"generally very nice staff.  great burgers for fast food.  the drive thru tends to be very slow however many days.  Some days are better than others though."}
{"text":"If you're around the E-gates during \"red eye hours,\" you don't have a lot of options for food. This is one of the few, though I don't know just how late they stay open (at least through midnight). We were satisfied with the burgers and drinks. Their fish sandwich is unnecessarily spicy. I don't know if it is this restaurant's job or the airport's job to clean the trash bins, but whoever was responsible obviously hadn't emptied them in many hours, as they were overflowing. Personally, I would have preferred Popeye's if (a) I knew where it was, and (b) I knew it was open."}
{"text":"It's nice to see more establishments offering discounts to Veterans.    Thanks for the tax break, Carl's Jr.!"}
{"text":"Every fast food restaurant is hopping on board with these reward programs and all it's doing is making us more overweight but whatever who is counting calories right? Came here the other night to redeem my buy one get one six dollar burger I got for checking in so many times on the Carl's Jr. App! Yes I said all lol they have an app you can download on your phone so that for every visit you get some points! Say goodbye to the old days of cutting out this coupons from the Sunday's paper and scan the barcode on your phone! Burgers are always fresh and love that charbroiled taste! Bit more pricey than the average burger joint but you get what you pay for! Service was sub par a bit too relaxed for me I understand it's fast food but there still has to be a level of professionalism people.."}
{"text":"Who would have thought I would give such high ratings for a well known fast food joint! However, I am.  Yet, this review is 5+ stars to the incredible general manager Kenn.  Let's start off by saying I wasn't in the mood to cook since I had a long day of studying and we decided something quick and the drive-thru option was our ticket.  To our amaze we were humorously greeted and hilariously teased that brought a great big smile to our faces and we laughed continuously well after we left.  We welcomed Kenn's genuine spirit and his humor with funny punch lines of that'll be two million dollars at the first window....LOL we looked at each other and just laughed out loud. His humor was well received. He really brightened our spirits especially from the devastating events in Paris the night before, we had been somber.  Kenn provided great suggestions on new food items we hadn't tried and went with it and guess what my guy enjoyed the suggestion of the spicy-heated \"diablo\" burger. Well done Kenn and with the combination of who this gentleman is and his professionalism we said, we may not be great fans of the food of Carl's Jr, but we will certainly return because of Kenn's superiorness of customer service with excellence! Well done Kenn. Well done! I also inquired when he works to make sure we stop in for future visits and his time is limited but informed he just happened to fill in for the night during our visit.  A bitter sweet for sure, but I hope Kenn is stationed here more often for our enjoyment.  THANK YOU KENN. May others mirror you. :)"}
{"text":"I'm really bummed that Carl's jr is starting to skimp on the food. The chicken sandwich has shrunk and the sandwich was 90% lettuce and the large fry was hardly a medium when dumped out. Also Carl's jr has a new rewards app and you get rewards for checking in and the location was selected but said it didn't recognize any Location nearby. I asked the person at the register to help me and she said \"I didn't know we had an app\" and the other person said \"it's having problems\". They did even offer to honor the initial register/check in offer"}
{"text":"Spending the day in Vegas, shopping. We came up from Lake Havasu City, Az.  We have two locations on in Havasu the other on the 40 & 95. We won't go to those anymore, every single time we've it's been bad. They could take some lesson from this location!!! Our cashier Rick, was pleasant when taking our order, he brought us our food and even came back to check on us to see if all was ok with food or if we needed anything else.  Rick is hopefully a manager or moving up to one soon. He could easily go to any other full restaurant and be amazing. Thanks again for a great burger and fries, like we remember them!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food. Carl's Jr does hamburgers right. They do a good job with the onion rings. Not too thin and not too big as a lot of other places make them. I just tried their buffalo sauce chicken tenders. The sauces is good but the delivery is poor. The just put sauce on top of their tenders. This makes the breading soggy."}
{"text":"When fast food is no longer 'fast' food,  then what is left? Stopped here in a hurry and... We deeply regretted it.  Either they are painfully slow, or they were giving priority to drive through customers which in my opinion is totally wrong."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, I drove thru and I paid my order so he told me have a nice day so I thought it was another  2 window to pick up my food, so I went back walking, it was another car behind I couldn't back up and guy was already helping to the person like he didn't even care he told me you was suppose stay over her now I have to go park and I will bring your food. Okay I said no problem.. and I waited 15 minutes to get my food.. so I ask him if I were stay at the first widow would I wait 15 minutes. he reply and  sais I guess!!!! Lol.. Bad customer services and lier.."}
{"text":"These people do NOT staff accordingly for the lunch rush! One (1) order of chicken tenders = 10 minutes. But It took them 6 minutes to get someone to take my order, as the cashier was running back and forth to take food to the customers waiting in the dining room."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thu, was there for like 30 seconds with dead silence.  I said hello, heard the guy say \"one second\".  I waited one minute and nothing.  I did some things in my car and looked up to see 5 mins had passed, so I said hello again.  \"One second\".  I waited 3 more mins and since I finished what I was doing in my car I was ready to drive through and leave, then I hear \"what can I get ya\".  After the order he barely talked to me, too busy talking to those inside and laughing/joking around.  According to the receipt, the cashiers name was Raquel, but I'm guessing that's a chicks name and he was a dude."}
{"text":"I don't usually write Yelp reviews, unless there is a coupon up for grabs. However this was such a wonderful experience I decided to review real quick. They were really friendly!! Everyone was polite and professional, my food was hot and delicious and fast and I got extra sauce like I asked. Wow if fast food was always this way I would eat it more lol . Don't know if it was just the time of day but thank you guys for being friendly you made my day better"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Carl's junior I hype up there food all the time because it is a tasty burger but at this specific location I was very displease by my food which had tasted all thrown together with a very small tomato that was on the edge of my burger and sauce being in some places and the burger being dry in others."}
{"text":"So many incompetent employees. Literally just left the drive thru seconds ago because your employee REPEATEDLY asked me to speak louder to the point I was almost yelling and then put the wrong order into the computer. My god. Your female employees are A LOT better."}
{"text":"I have said it before that Carl's is my favorite fast food burger and the double western is the way to go, but this location was a HUGE FAIL!!!   My buddy and I placed our orders, took our numbers and sat down. 20 minutes later there was still no food. Seriously 20 minutes, no exaggeration!!! So I walk up to the counter only to find out that they cleared our order on their screen and forgot all about us.   No hey man, sorry about that or we'll get it out ASAP. They just pulled some food off of there heating station and put it on a try.   The burger was dry, the onion rings on my burger were hard, and the cheese was old. Not giving up on Carl's but for sure not going back to this one!"}
{"text":"Reminds me why I just don't dig fast food anymore."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Last resort for food while on call. The bathroom is disgusting, probably worse than a prison cell. Crossing my fingers not to get sick. Come here if you have no other option."}
{"text":"Walked in to have lunch. Hoping for chicken Star at Carls Jr. To find out the didn't even have them. How can you have a Carls. Jr with out chicken stars. I mean why have the star on the building!!! Come on..."}
{"text":"I wish I couldn't even give it one star, my husband and I went in there for a quick bite before going grocery shopping. We went to the counter; we were not greeted for one, two they all looked at both my husband and I like we don't belong in here because of our skin color and two they all spoke spanish not one drop of English! I'm sorry, but if you are going to work in a fast food restaurant in America you better start speaking our language. I will never go to this one EVER again!"}
{"text":"The burger was so cold. Waiting over 15 minutes for the fast food! My kids asked for water and the old guy cashier with the glasses shouted '1 dollar for the cup' don't eat here. The cashiers are so rude and didn't pay attention on their job instead just keep chatting in the back counter!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the six dollar burger! I wasn't this impressed with the service thought. Perhaps the order taker was not have a great day, or maybe they just do not enjoy being there. Food is great though."}
{"text":"I love Carl's jr. Always the freshest lettuce and tomato and onions and really good beef in the burgers. The only hesitation is the price. Also Green Burrito very good menu and good selections. My puppy even got a treat."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW *** I gave it another shot, going in and ordering my Western Bacon Cheeseburger. It was much much better. The bacon was crispy, my burger was hot, fresh and juicy. The cheese was melted and my onion ring was fresh out of the fryer. I will be back. I have added a star.  I ordered the Western Bacon Cheeseburger and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. For the same price I could have gone next door to Farmers Bros and gotten a much better quality sandwich.  My sandwich was borderline cold and had stale bacon from the breakfast shift. The customer service was good and they greeted me with a smile.  It is also a very clean restaurant. It's not enough to keep me from giving them another shot...."}
{"text":"I've ordered the All Natural burger before form other locations and it was good but this location did not give me the same burger.  The meat was paper thin with very stranger circular marks and tasted horrible. The cheese was obviously bad and after 2 bites I put it down and took pictures. Yeah THAT BAD.  So gross."}
{"text":"Pulled straight up to the Squawk Box with no waiting. Oddly enough we were asked to wait. The friendly voice finally came back and took our order. The order was filled relatively quickly and the food was hot and fresh. Nothing to wax philosophical about but all in all it was a decent visit. Status quo as far as a drive thru goes."}
{"text":"Well I was coming home from the Cubs vs Whitesox game at Camelback ranch and I hadn't realized how the heat had took out of me. I was lightheaded....drowsy....and I had a mild headache. So I realized I had not eaten anything really all day.....so I decided to stop at Carl's Jr because I know they have an awesome Jalapeno Turkey Burger. I had the combo with fries and a drink and it really hit the spot. This particular location is pretty clean....the service is good....and I got my food very quickly after I ordered. I don't get to Carl's Jr much because there is not one really close to me....but in the future when I come from a spring training game for the SOX.....Carl's Jr will be definitely be a must stop if I am hungry. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Said 3 times at order window, plain DBL . After a 20 min wait with the lobby empty and 2 people in front of me, I finally got the wrong order. When I fiannly get the correct order, the burger was dry and chalky."}
{"text":"Went to drive thru and I'm still waiting for my food and it has now been over 30 minutes. Ridiculous service here. Not good for the first time trying this place out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a fast food joint!  My brother insisted I try them when I told him I'd never eaten there before. Hesitatingly, I agreed.   I was instantly drawn in to the ginormous picture on the front window of \"Memphis BBq burger\" and my bro explained the whole $6 burger deal with them. Apparently this is their moneymaker burgers and I went ahead and ordered the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries.   The burger was darn good!  It was a cheeseburger with crispy onion strings, BBQ sauce and pulled pork. I could have used a little more of the pork but everything seemed of good quality and I was pretty impressed with this joint.    I'll stop hating on Carl Jr's from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive thru for almost 10 minutes while on hold waiting to order. It was morning and there were no cars ahead of me or behind me and only one car in the parking lot. I eventually just left. Pathetic service."}
{"text":"Flattened, soggy, pretzel breakfast sandwich - nothing like the ad.  Just Nasty!"}
{"text":"I like the Breakfast Burgers, it's like breakfast and lunch on the same sandwich. Nice egg, bacon and taters all together in a hamburger will keep you going all day long. Really fast drive thru service and the people are prompt and friendly. There are lots of Carls Jr.s in town, but this is the best. Even the graveyard crew is on the ball no matter what the hour. You can tell they are well trained here, not like the store in North Las Vegas by the 215, that place is the worst!"}
{"text":"I'll stick to the Sante Fe grilled Chicken sandwich... it rocks!"}
{"text":"So slow you need a calendar to time them. And attitude? Oh yeah. Super sassy bad attitudes with every order. Not Coming Back - Ever..."}
{"text":"You have to stand at that counter for what seems like days to get noticed. Once I ordered I thought I'd wash my hands and use the restroom. Big mistake. Feces all over the floor and toilet and even the sinks are filthy and graffiti covered. I left the restroom feeling dirtier than when I went in. Food was decent, but this place should win an award for the nastiest restroom in Phoenix, maybe Arizona! Not a one time experience. This is at least the third trip here when the place is in the same condition. I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I went here and I recieved my food hot and quick I was out within 6 minutes with a 6 person order. The food was hot and we had no problems with our order."}
{"text":"It's 10 after 10pm and they are open till 11 posted on the door. All the doors are locked and the guy in side is just shrugging his shoulders at me saying they're closed. It's posted on the door that they're supposed to be open till 11 PM. Crappy customer service will not be back."}
{"text":"This location is HORRIBLE!!!!! They said she was a new trainee which is fine ... but she did not get my order right, what so ever... I got criss cut fries when I did not order them! All of my drinks were not correct! There was no napkins in my bag. I asked for one of my burgers to be plain and they made it with everything on it... the customer service was horrible . I am so un happy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not come to this Carl's Jr. After waiting a full 15 minutes for my order I get home only to realize that they did not give me my fries they added tomato when I requested no tomato and the meat is cold. Oh and my little sister would like for me to add that they didn't give cherries in our milkshakes! I can't believe I skipped on in and out to come get some Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Went there late at 12:45PM but they were closed. It's supposed to close at 1:15PM. If they don't answer the phone, don't bother showing up here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE and RUDE management with no customer service. This Carl's is not a good one. The woman manager asked us to go around the front to wait for our food.  No problem.  Over 10 min later we go inside and she forgot to even cook the food!   The place was not busy at all.  Another woman was complaining about same thing.   She did not compensate us at all for her mistake, 20 min later we get our complete order, our other food is cold and all she said was \"Sorry\".    We even asked for our money back or a coupon for a free meal next visit. NOPE!  Sorry.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Tout bon burgers en direct de l'aéroport de Vegas par contre délai d'attente assez long ! A tester, les onions rings :)"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time.  Went in on 9/11/15 with my husband and daughter around 12:30. There was no wait and we placed our order right away. Having said that, it seemed to take a while to get our food.  They brought us our order, which they rang up incorrectly, causing us to have to place another order for more food and pay separately.   The burgers and fries were cold (onion rings were hot, the only redeeming part of the meal) but we were in a rush and didn't want to complain and have our meal take even longer.   The other food we ordered came out, all of which was stone cold. We did say something about this, and the manager had an attitude like, \"No way those burgers were cold\".   We were expecting hot burgers to come out pretty quickly. Man were we wrong. We watched at least 3 other orders be filled while we waited. In my day, a customer complaint got taken care of right away, not shoved to the back of the line. Maybe their microwave was on the fritz???  Warm food finally came out, and we ate it fast because we were late to an appointment by this time.  Carl's Jr receipts conspicuously lack a customer service survey or phone number. I guess they don't care about the customer experience???  Summary: Skip the headache and go for Five Guys. The manager sets the tone for the crew and the experience. This manager did not care about her customers or food quality. You may spend a little more at Five Guys but their burgers are hot, fresh and made to order. (I don't work for them but I do enjoy Five Guys burgers)."}
{"text":"Originally I used to like this location because it was convenient for lunch purposes.  Today I've had the worst experience out of all the restaurants I've eaten at.  A few weeks ago I was eating at this location and I took a photo of an employee texting on her phone and posted it to Yelp which you possibly can still view.  Harmless photo....  Well today after I ate my lunch I was getting  ready to leave and I was approached by an employee that works here.  As he approached me he had a phone in his hand and he had my yelp profile pulled up and asked if that was me. I stated yes but I thought it was a little weird that he'd have my profile on his phone.  This employee states that his management wanted me to take a photo down that I posted a few weeks ago and that it was against the law for me to post a picture of an employee without their consent to yelp.  This same employee then stated that the mother of the employee I snapped a photo of worked there and that the employee was UNDER AGE.  I then asked him if she was under age what is she doing working there?  He really didn't have a reply for that.  I asked this employee to show me where it's against  the law to take photos and post them to yelp.    He then got a little irate.  It just amazed me that instead of serving the customers he's going through his phone and pulling up yelp reviews and confronting customers with them.  One minute he is stating that management wants me to take the photo off and then the next minute he's telling me I'm breaking the law and that Carl's Jr has lawyers and they could sue me.  At this point I was tired of listening to his nonsense and asked him to get out of my face.  Then this employee had the nerve to tell me to get out of HIS store.  All this over a photo!  At this point this employee starts yelling for his manager across the store with other customers in the store.    This same employee has horrible customer service.  Several weeks before this incident today I ordered a simple low carb burger and went to sit down.  I watched 3 other customers come in and order and receive their food before me.  So I went to ask for a refund.  At first he say he couldn't do a refund and that I would have to come back for a refund because a manager was there. I demanded a refund because I waited around 15 minutes and watched other get their food.  So then  he's telling me I have to sign a receipt saying I got a refund. I declined to sign the receipt.  I didn't sign anything when I paid for the food.  I was a little upset because my food was sitting under the warmer the whole time and he just either refused to bring it out or was just overlooked it.  Ever since then he  has had a chip on his shoulder.    One thing I do not like about situations like this is that when you say your going to make a complaint to corporate or their district manager....he responds with his first and last name like he's bullet proof or untouchable. This employee thinks it's okay to confront customers in the store and demand them to alter their reviews or photos.....then states it's managers request and then wrongly quotes the law.  I  think managers are smart enough to realize not to mention anything positive or negative involving reviews especially since it's a fast food chain.   I feel this is a case of an employee just thinking he can say or do whatever he wants involving customers."}
{"text":"Omg one of my worst food experiences ever. We only stopped here because the little Greek Cafe is closed on Sunday and we didn't want to keep hunting for food.   1) The cashier. I think my kitchen table has more personality.   2) we picked the cleanest table around and still had to wipe it off with napkins. After she saw us do that, the cashier told another guy to clean some tables. He cleaned one with the same rag he then used to clean food trays. Simply disgusting!!  3) the food. Yuck. The fries were hot and that's the only good thing I can say. The burger was a freaking mess. At least get the condiments on the sandwich please. And the taste was not good at all. I ate it but only because I was so hungry at that time.   Between the sanitary conditions and the taste of the food, it is safe to say that I will not be returning here. Ever."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of fast food places but once in a while they satisfy a craving. I went to this Carl's Jr. for breakfast this morning. I ordered the Big Country burrito which came with some hash towns and a coffee. I ate three or four of the hash browns and stopped because they tasted old and stale. The burrito wasn't flavorless but the flavor it had tasted like motor oil. To finish my meal, my coffee was some of the worst swill I have ever tasted. Most truck stops have better coffee than this place.  So in closing, this fast food dispensary does nothing more than provide terrible food with mediocre service. Save your time and your taste buds, go to a 7Eleven and get a Snickers bar."}
{"text":"I love Carl's Jr always have, never have I had a problem with their food, well today I went and orded a famous star combo . fries were hard and dry. OK so I put those aside , whatever.  I open my burger and the bread is hard as rock.  What??? How is it hard when Carl's is supposed to make fresh bread ! My burger tastes like it has been sitting out since this morning. I'm very dissapointed.  And this frankly has ruined my Carl's Jr experience for a while.  Idk why but um still in shock my bread is hard. It looks fake from how hard it is. Lol"}
{"text":"Really nice clean location - I think it's also fairly new. The food was fresh - I ordered the new Breakfast Burger and my wife had French Toast sicks, we just missed the  breakfast hours but she was happy they still served us some breakfast items. They delivered the food to our table in just a few minutes."}
{"text":"I went to this Carl's Jr. drive thru at night . Ordered our food parked close by started eating the burger(decided to eat in the car really quickly. It was also dark out)and while I was already 3/4s into the burger i had asked to turn on the light of the car . I end up seeing my burger all moldy from the OUTSIDE to the INSIDE of the bun ! When I went back to speak to a manager the employee who was doing the drive thru said she was the manager and that i can \"hold for a minute\". I then said \"I'm sorry but this , what I just ate cannot wait a minute\" she then...not once ever looked at me since I acknowledged her... said again \"hold on one moment\" I obviously raised my voice a little and said \"ma'am I was just served a moldy hamburger bun! This cannot hold on a minute\" she then said \"oh yea\" came over and looked at me confused and said \"so... do you want your money back?\" I then told her \"no i just need to talk to someone who is higher than you cause you cannot be the manager and be so careless as to give me this burger all moldy\" she then said \"I'm sorry but that's not my fault it's the cooks fault\" .She was very rude . And when I went to ask for the receipt she denied me back my receipt and denied for me to take pictures of the moldy bread . Her name was Guadalupe. It was during the night shift at 9:21. And while I was walking out the lady who was behind the counter in the cook section yelled \"oh now you're not so tough . Walk away!\"  Very rude . And very disgusting. I have already placed complaints with the health department, food inspector, corporate and the district manager !"}
{"text":"The only reason for the 2 stars is the fact that I waited at the counter for a few minutes to order my food, in plain sight of Diana who decided having a conversation with another employee overrode any acknowledgement. NONE! When I brought this up she snidely remarked that she was talking about work. I'm sorry your customers are your work and should come first!! ALWAYS!! We pay your salary.  The saving grace was Michelle. Not only was she working the drive thru but she also gave me wonderful service with a smile. Keep up the great work Michelle. Diana you need to work on your work ethic and people skills. Being rude to your customers is not becoming."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Just got out of the hospital.  Went to Carls Jr and ordered double western bacon and a large orange drink with now ice. (I can't have a very cold drink)   I got home and found a single burger and NO bacon.  Also a large orange with a cup FULL of ice."}
{"text":"This was the poorest hamburger display ever! I ordered the western bacon cheeseburger and 2 happy meals.....hamburgers were cold. My hamburger was also dry becauase there was barley any bbq sauce on the burger and the kids happy meals burger was super tiny with more bun than anything and to top it off the buns were stale and chewy.  My 8 yr old son said his hamburger bun looked burnt and smashed and that was before I even said anything."}
{"text":"I always love a good Carl's Jr. Burger and this place is no exception. This is a nice and clean restaurant in Henderson. The people are very friendly and we got our food pretty quickly. The fries were kind of cold and stale, but I don't usually eat all the fries anyway. I would have asked for fresh fries but I mostly wanted the burger. Will come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite restaurant lol!!           A1 burger with cheese yummy...                       And Very nice to..."}
{"text":"Mediocre food but it's fast food so what can you expect? The drive thru line was incredibly slow. And when I got to the window to pay for my daughters kids meal, the employee failed to give me my credit card back and I failed to notice. Thankfully she ran out with it as I was realizing that she still had it."}
{"text":"Really cant believe the stupidity of the caliber of employees,  4 different Carls Jr. Managers from 2 stores. First store place order...order was discovered to be wrong NOT only the wrong burger, but absolutely plain several mins later after I left was on HWY....another Carls Jr. store on the way home I stop tell them the problem. NOW SAME OWNERS OF THESE LOCATIONS...I ASKED FIRST QUESTION... the store asst. managers both tell me NO they cant replace the burger from both stores...I have witnesses (a friend and 6 customers, 1 of whom left once she heard what was going on).....It gets better they both say they cant give away free food....and they dont want to get in trouble for it....MEANWHILE IM HEATED AND LAUGHING FROM THE STUPIDITY......Its was listen I paid for this shit $8.17 to be exact...your not giving me anything for free...Im looking for what I paid for...Meanwhile Now the Managers of each store is involved on phone and THEY REFUSED.......WTF REALLY IS WRONG WITH  YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS...IS OUR YOUNGER GENERATION OF KIDS REALLY THIS DUMB!!  To FINISH I will be calling Corporate on both stores, the BBB, and emailing sites all over the internet."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this location I have had horrible service. The chicken tenders have been old and greasy. They always mess up my order, either forgetting something or not removing something. I love Carl's Jr. And this location ruins the image. If this was the only location I went to I would never return to any Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Prepare to WAIT in the drive-thru if the evening crew is working. This location used to be solid, but as of late, it's been one frustrating experience after another. It's the little things that count...such as when you order chicken fingers and you'd expect them all to be fresh--not 1/2 old, 1/2 fresh in the same order. It's going through a drive thru and expecting it to take 2-3 minutes max, but 8 mins or more is normal (after 4pm). This scenic location for a restaurant is perfect and Carl's Jr. is completely wasting it.   Chick-Fil-A missed out and should have bought the land first. :("}
{"text":"Poor...very poor... We ordered our meal at 4:44pm and the lady taking our order forgot to give us our cups for our drinks, and proceeded to take the order of the kids standing in line behind us. There was no one else in line. We continued to stand there while she took their order and then walked away....we waited until 4:54pm trying to get someone's attention before the young man taking care of the drive thru window finally walked over to see what we needed... RUDE!! VERY! If someone is standing there obviously trying to get your attention you don't ignore them and walk away...if I hadn't already paid I would have walked out...but I can say I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Just redeemed my Carls Rewards for a free meal !!!!!!   The meal was pretty good, but this location wasn't the best. The food just didn't taste the same, there was only one guy running the front. He was taking front orders, plus drivethru and bagging food!!! Seems like he needed a bit of help.  If I had of been paying cash for the meal, I just might've sent it back or asked for a new burger to be made. But all and all it was ok."}
{"text":"Stale, almost room-temperature hash browns and biscuits as hard as the table I was sitting at, isn't really what I was looking for in a cheat-day breakfast."}
{"text":"Second in a line of 3 cars in the Drive-Thru and we sat for 12 minutes. REALLY?! Piss Poor Management!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go for dinner. Drive thru guy was pretty average. Not too much happened between us and them. May need to visit another time just to get a better feel for it."}
{"text":"Wow!  I think this is the best Carls Jr meal Ive ever had in my life. No. Forreal. My Burger and Onion Rings were PERFECT, the nice lady who took my order was efficient. I went on a Saturday afternoon, not crowded (an old couple eating and a vagabond sleeping in one of the booths in the back) above all, you KNOW your Carls Jr burger was GOOD when you use 15 napkins!!  Ok, Im going to take a nap now, Im full."}
{"text":"This was the first Carl's Jr I ever ate at.  The Realtor showing me rental houses back in '93 took me here for lunch.  The lunch was fine.  The only property he showed me that would accept pets I filled out the paperwork for only to find out cats are not pets according to that owner.  I also forgot my hat as we left.  Even though I drive by it several times a week I seldom stop as it doesn't fit my schedule.  This morning I had their breakfast burger, which I have had before, and with beef, bacon, egg, hashbrowns and stuff it really is a breakfast on a bun.  Even at 6AM on a Saturday they were doing a steady stream of business at the drive through but only one other customer at the walk up counter.  I am sure this location has been remodeled since my first visit over 16 years ago.  It is in very god condition."}
{"text":"I was thinking this would be quicker than going to my normal one on Northern.  It may be a bit closer but getting back out of the parking lot on to Camelback West bound takes forever.  That's not the reason for the loss of a star.  I ordered one of my favorite burgers, a bacon guacamole six dollar burger.  I got it to go with a side salad and a small drink ($7.89 as a combo).  I should have known something wasn't quite right when my order was up faster than I could fill my drink at the fountain.  The meat was very well done and not very hot.  A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.  The bright spot in this was the staff.  I was greeted before I could get to the counter by everyone except the cook.  And on my way out I was thanked for coming in by the manager and two other staff.  Fast food is nice but if by getting really fast the quality goes away you haven't gained anything.  I may give them another chance but not much further away is another location that has always gotten it right."}
{"text":"Guacamole Bacon Six Dollar burger  This ranks amongst the few fast food burgers that really satisfies the craving for a big chunk of ground beef with enough stuff on it that it is guaranteed to come apart before you are done and make sure you are wearing some of it too. Price was reasonable at $7.49 for a combo meal.  With fries that comes to 1360 calories, mostly from fat.  And 3000mg of sodium.  I'm going to have to eat a bunch of rabbit food to counter that. :-)  This location has been there 4 or 5 years and while I have eaten from there many times it is the first time I have gone over there and eaten in.  The floor paint is the only thing I saw with any real wear to it.  Everything was nice and clean.  The \"new\" concept of service where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table has been around at Carl's Jr and Whataburger for as long as I remember.  They even came to clear my table just as I put the last bite in my mouth."}
{"text":"Monica took my order in the drive-thru I paid over $15 for my families meal, I left the drive thru and check my bags in the parking lot, thank God I did, I was missing three items that I had ordered. Had to go inside and tell her I was missing three items she had a look on her face like she didn't believe me so I gave her my receipt. She didn't say anything and turned around and got my items made. At the end of all this when she was handing me my bags I said thank you and she didn't even apologize for her mistake. Her customer service skills need to be improved. As a business owner myself I suggest Carl's jr. To find a replacement employee with great customer service skills. I have read other reviews as well and I'm not the only customer to complain about Monica."}
{"text":"Had to go get the Grill Cheese Burger after seeing all the commercials and ruining my diet!!!  Darn commercials.  These honestly looks better on TV and I imagined it tasting better.  It was basically I bacon cheese burger with extra cheese.  The cheeses were not thoroughly melted enough for me.  I should have still home with a grill cheese sandwich.  The employees were very very friendly!"}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr is lacking intelligent staff. I came in for breakfast with a group of friends. It was a female cashier around 10:30 and ordered a Breakfast burger combo with orange juice. She asked me what size orange juice which I then replied with regular she then asked if I wanted a combo which is what I stated when I first placed my order. My bf then ordered his sausage and biscuits (3) and she even messed up that order also. He didn't get what he ordered but we passed on complaining on it due to what we just experienced."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Staff was nice and order was perfectly made and fast.   Nice cute manager gave me a midnight moonshine jar when I forgot about it with my meal ;)."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is still in business.  The food is horrible!  It's always cold and tastes like it's been sitting there for days! The prices are ridiculous!  The staff is ok and mostly get your order right. Last two times my family ate there we got food poisoning.  Never again! I would give them a negative 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I like it and will go back but it is not as good as the US locations. Shakes are awesome though. Really good and tons of options"}
{"text":"The food is good. The cashier was sweet. But the girl who brought us the food which was the drive thru girl she just gave us our food with attitude and didn't say anything. Really rude"}
{"text":"They have great chicken tenders that always taste freshly made. BUT if you go thru the Drive-Thru, always check your order before you leave. The last three times I ordered the 5 piece chicken tenders, my order only had 3. So either somebody doesn't know how to count in there, or it's done deliberately. Whatever the reason, it's absolutely annoying and inconvenient to have to park and walk in just to get the two missing pieces."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! I'm writing a review about a fast food joint?! Never would I have pictured myself doing this, but it is SO amazing!!!  To echo what everyone below has said: ALL fast food joints should train at this store-secret shop it, whatever! This place hires the NICEST people-Managers, Part Time workers, etc. ALWAYS clean, ALWAYS pleasant (i've been there at all hours of the night and day), and (my favorite and what I teach at my business): SMILE!!!!!  I seriously RECOMMEND this place to people-and its fast food! (no offense what-so-ever)  I just can't get over it: amazing! Keep up the amazing work and I really hope other businesses (fast food or otherwise) take your lead.  I really hope your senior/regional Managers take notice-every single one of your employees and managers deserves a serious Spot Award!"}
{"text":"I seriously get cravings for the fried zucchini at Carl's Jr. So I came back after about a year. Have to say the food has been good and the service polite. I like when there is a wait, let's me think my food is freshly prepared. I don't go inside,  just the drive thru and the wait is what I expect it to be at 6pm."}
{"text":"somehow just got ripped off on a \"value meal\". for this amount of money i coulda gone to a real restaurant.  save you money for decent food"}
{"text":"This is one massive space. They've utilized the space by offering a myriad of seating options. So whether you come on your own or with a hoard of fast food loving peeps - you, my friend, are set.  There's a separate milkshake bar. If you want to hang out at the bar, I think that would be a funny past time but to each their own.  Alright. Completely clueless about this American chain until I heard the buzz about it. After trying it, I will say, it tastes like Burger King. That's not a bad thing. I like whoppers but I wasn't quite prepared for its similarities.  In fact, for me, Toronto has some sad Burger King locations like the dufferin location. In such desperate need of a remodel, this Carl Jr's to me, is an upscale modern version of it.   They spare no expense in saying they are all about burgers and milkshakes. I tried their Chocolate Gorilla Shake (chocolate banana) . It was tasty!   I would probably go back some time. It's extremely clean, service was fast, wifi if you need and I loved the variety of options for milkshakes.  By far, not the best fast food but not the worst either."}
{"text":"This Carl's is always consistently great.  Since the new manager took over several months ago, this Carl's has been run like an Old School Carl's Jr.  The restaurant is clean, the food nearly looks like the photos, and the staff is extremely friendly and really seem to care about delivering an excellent product and excellent customer service!  Great Job!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I have been in a Carl's. Again a chain and to be honest a bit pricey for fast food, but what-ch-gonna-do? Burger was decent, fries were ok as well. This store is clean and the person at the counter did bring our order, and introduce herself, humm.."}
{"text":"I miss the Carl's Jr from back in the days. The burgers were so much bigger. They are good still but I remember the ol days when you got more for your $$$. I am thankful tho for the military discount."}
{"text":"I've always liked Carl's Jr. Probably because my mum likes this place. (Shot out to ya Mum!!!) Recently, I picked up this coupon thing for $6 giving me a couple freebies as well as a bunch of buy 1/get 1's. So I'll be visiting Carls a bit, until my vouchers run out or my taste buds are fed up with me. I've been to this location several times in my life. Always clean & never had an issue with service. On a tangent, I do miss how Carl's USE TO BE BIGGER/HARDIER LIKE Hardy's (I know they are the same but why not act like it-RIGHT.......) Gotta say tho this time I got a good laugh from the counter guy. I swear he was high! He didn't mess up my order at all but he was a bit magoo. I'm 1 out of 2 tables in the dining area, they had their food already, and he didn't remember I was the only person in there that had ordered recently so he was looking around to make sure he was bringing the food to the right guy. hilarious!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the all natural double burger, with natural cut fries and chicken tenders. I also had the chocolate malt milkshake. The burger patties were thin, dry, and a bit charred. The natural cut fries and milkshake were okay. The chicken tenders are pretty good------ they were tender and juicy. The customer service was fast and friendly. But I think I'll stick with other burger places if I'm in the mood for a burger and Cane's if I'm in the mood for chicken tenders."}
{"text":"In a city that thrives on creation and tasty hamburgers this place is subpar.  The burger was left to be desired, fries were not bad, milkshake was ok.   Was curious by the brand, left somewhat disappointed would I go back... sadly no."}
{"text":"Fresh cooked food made to order ,this place is good but could use alittle cleanup and the front DOOR FIXED!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is becoming one of the most don't stop off to Carl's Jr. This morning I ordered Cheeseburgers and when I got home two of then had no meat on them. Did not enjoy the cheese sandwich. Times before the so called fresh biscuits we like rocks, and the mile high burger had like broken pieces of bacon on top that looked like bacon bit's. These are the same people the take a day off to strike for $15.00 per hour, Your getting what you deserve. Take pride in your job, you choose it, guess I am now 100% Jack In the Box Man now. Shame on you all."}
{"text":"Had a buy 1 get 1 free sandwich coupon, tried the famous star.  It was freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Wow. First time to this location and major fail.   Food order was all wrong.   Burgers missing half ingredients and just warm.   Fries not fresh at all.   Service of staff was below average.   Last time coming to this location.   Please do not give this a try. Fail. Wish option was zero star."}
{"text":"One person working the window and counter looks like she hates her life. And I was the only one there. The customer service is ridiculous. No eye contact. No greeting. Fries were cold. I'm going to learn one day to stop coming here."}
{"text":"I've given this location a try many times and it always disappoints.  The food is not fresh and it doesn't taste good.  Every once in a while, I will get the urge to have a Western Bacon Cheeseburger and I'll have to drop by to get one....however, I always leave this particular location regretting my decision to do so.  Unfortunately, in Scottsdale, there aren't any other choices for Carl's Jr nearby.  Return Factor - 15%"}
{"text":"I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those \"fresh made\" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.    It took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.  Next up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.  Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.  They get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!  Return Factor - 0.001%"}

{"text":"Carl's Jr. has excellent customer service!! I ordered the big Carl and fried zucchini with a medium Coke Zero!! The big Carl is a big sandwich but it is SO good. I love the sauce they have on it. I think Carl's Jr. is my favorite burger restaurant. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Denise- a manager at this place, should not be working here, let alone be a manager. She was extremely rude, shouting through the speaker in the drive through and nearly throwing our food at us, shutting the window before I could ask her for a thing of ranch. I never write reviews about anything or any place but as a person working in the food service industry, you need to at least pretend to be cordial. By the way, all three sandwiches were smashed."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that I've only tried the crisscut fries.  The place itself is pretty big. Used to be an HMV so was surprised this place took over. It's nicely decorated and fits with theme. My first time in a Carl's Jr.  I only ordered the crisscut fries since this was a late night stop. While the texture was fine, it was far too oily for my liking. I couldn't escape the feeling of unhealthiness each time I ate one since it left a shiny oil mark on my fingers.  Perhaps I'll give the burgers a try next time but I hope they're not as oily."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. (a.k.a. Hardee's) is my favorite place to grab a quick Burger and this specific location is  the one most easily accessible to me. What I especially like about this burger provider is the fact that the menu regularly changes throughout the year - year after year.   Their television commercials have become somewhat less outlandish than they used to be, but are still quite enjoyable.  Unlike Burger King or McDonald's with their ever-present and no longer very innovative Whoppers and Big Macs, Carl's never stops  introducing a new burger with a twist of one sort or another. The current novelty at the time of this review is the Memphis barbecue burger and the one that I stopped by to try.  Carl's also regularly has two-for-one coupons and other money saving offers available to one and all in the advertising inserts that accompany the Las Vegas Review-Journal. You  can even sign up online to get their email offers.   Burger King issues coupons at a lesser frequency, McDonald's hardly has coupons at all anymore and I can't remember when Wendy's last had any coupons available - pretty much never. It must be against Wendy's policy to do so.  In any case if you need a quick burger or chicken sandwich fix, Carl's definitely will not disappoint while simultaneously keeping that coupon clipper inside you quite content as you save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. (a.k.a. Hardee's) is my favorite place to grab a quick Burger and this specific location is  the one most easily accessible to me. What I especially like about this burger provider is the fact that the menu regularly changes throughout the year - year after year.   Their television commercials have become somewhat less outlandish than they used to be, but are still quite enjoyable.

{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be back very clean and my food was out quickly I would recommend this to anyone who looking for a cheap and good food..."}
{"text":"Came to a driver threw gave me wrong drinks took my order wrong forgot to add a mean and then I tell her I need another one and she says we don't accept 100 dollar bills what are you talking about no where does it say you don't take hundred dollar bills. Then denisha says you can go to 7-Eleven and change it. Your kidding me I didn't go drive threw to get off 7 eleven to get you change!!!! Sorry you can't tell a real hundred from a fake one! So stupid"}
{"text":"Came in and my review is mostly going towards a worker there. I walked in and Cynthia, the worker up front, took her sweet time to go to the register and ask what I wanted. I told her I needed a minute and after a short while, she just stands at the register looking at me with a dirty look. The whole time she didn't smile and spoke with what seemed like attitude, she looked like she was miserable and while I get that everyone has bad days, I didn't do anything to her so I don't think the attitude and horrible customer service is right. The managers really need to fix up their management, considering this location already has bad ratings. Food is not too bad and the customer service is 0 out of 10."}
{"text":"Absolutley terrible service, pulled up to the drive thru window and the lady was rude after she took my payment. Then turned around to chit chat with her friends at the front register while on her phone. To top it off my chicken tenders i ordered that were supposedly \"breaded\" were horrible. You could tell she was just clock watching and didn't care about the quality of food or service she was providing. If i could give a half star i would."}
{"text":"Got coupons in mail that brought this Carl's to mind this morning and so made slight detour to stop by on my way to work, but the results were a bit grim.   I decided to go in and found the really large dining area to have one person in it, doing crossword puzzles.  There was no one at the counter, no customers, no staff.  Within about 30 seconds a young man with a headset came out of the kitchen to collect payment and hand food out the drive-up window, and who came over to work the counter and take my order as well.  There appeared to be, or at least I only caught sight of one person in the kitchen.  The drive-thru line was growing, food was slow coming out.  The young man stepped back to the kitchen apparently to assist as he returned bearing food to hand out the window.  Two more people entered.  At this 7:30 AM or so, they were out of some kind of spicy something one of the guys wanted to order.    I told the young man I was going to the restroom while awaiting my order.  The large, empty-but-for the guy doing crosswords was at least clean, as was the men's room, though the dark tile floors I think gave it a somewhat dated look, and stainless sink and no mirror, made it seem a little jail-like.  The stalls and fixtures were adequately clean and there was no trash on the floor, but there was no soap in the dispenser.  Paper towels were omitted in favor of a hand dryer.     My order was ready when I got back to the counter.  My Monster b'fast biscuit was BIG but kind of nauseatingly greasy. I couldn't eat the second one that came with the coupon deal, but my compliments on the orange cream shake.  It was kind of thin, compared to most fast food shakes, but slurped easily through a straw, and was quite good.  I might go back to give their burgers and sweet potato fries a try again for the first time in a couple of years, but not exactly feeling the urgency - even with coupons.   My compliments to staff for their performance under the (badly understaffed) circumstances."}
{"text":"This is by far THE WORST Carls Jr I have been to the cashier treated me disrepectfully and has poor customer service"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here 2xs as a quick bite to end our date night. Both times the food has been hot and fresh and the employees have been super nice. The steakhouse burger is so delicious! And the fries have been hot and cripsy!"}
{"text":"This place is talked about more than it should be.   The burgers are good but not amazing. I didn't get a milkshake because my friend says they're too sweet, and also not really that good. Overall, this place is okay, but just not worth it. Way too hyped up based on the success of its locations in the USA."}
{"text":"The woman in the drive thru was rude. I've had rough & tiring days myself but that's no excuse. She demanded the coupon then didn't even say thank you. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Food hot quick  and up to par the gal even brought out our order to our table, a rare thing these days at a fast food joint. Kudos"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it a zero, but Yelp would not let me. Where do I start. So I usually don't go here unless I have a coupon, but it was on the way to school so I went to the drive thru. The lady expected me to know what I wanted but it took me a sec. because all I could see was fatty burgers. I ordered the COD fish sandwich combo and proceeded to the window. It took them 15 min. to give me the order when the place was dead with no one in front or behind me. As I left, I realized she forgot to give me a drink so I made a u-turn and went back. She was surprised to see me again and had no idea she forgot my drink until I said something. She gave me the drink and I noticed that it didn't feel very heavy, she did not wait till the carbonation went down so my drink was 3/4 full. This time I went inside. She gave me a large drink which was nice and I left. After I finished my fries I went for my fish sandwich. Instead of getting what I ordered, which was on the receipt, so I know they placed the order correctly, they gave me a famous star burger. By then I was too far and frustrated to go back so I ate it. The burger wasn't good or bad, it was just ok. I didnt think any place could make mc'y d's look good, but I was wrong. I'm just thankful there's other burger places."}
{"text":"Went here today to return two famous star burgers I bought yesterday for lunch. I had ask for no onions and they both had onions. I did not have time to return yesterday so I went back today to get them re make. But because I had no receipt with me the manager did not want to remake them for me. He wanted proof that those burgers were purchased at this location. Because he was more worried about messing up his inventory numbers than taking care of the customer. Can you believe that BS!! I brought the food back with me. It's not like I went there with no receipt and no food demanding them to remake it or asking for a refund. I brought the food back and ask if I can get it remade with no onions and the manager said NO because I have no receipt. So, after a while of going back and forth and him accusing me of buying these burgers somewhere else, he remade my burgers with a horrible attitude and told me to bring a receipt next time. So, if I would of had a receipt but no food, how would of that played out? We will never find out. I just need to find a different place to eat."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place with a 0 star!!! All I want is a strawberry malt after work around 7-8 p.m. Apparently when a young lady named Crystal works they never have ice cream or milk. I've been there 8 times in two months and I've only had the malt made twice and it was from a young man named Charles. I've even spoken to management as Charles was making my second malt and she told me that the young lady that works nights gets a lot of complaints. She told me that she's heard from guest that she's rude and unprofessional. This came straight from managements mouth. I gave this one star for Charles helping me and giving me great customer service. If you don't have enough milk or ice cream during the night, take shakes and malts off of the menu."}
{"text":"Yes...I'm reviewing a fast food restaurant.  Usually for me to review one, I had an awesome experience, really bad one, or because I'm the temporary Duke. For this Carl's Jr., it's because the service is great and I'm the current Duke.  Besides, this Carl's deserves their props.  This Carl's is conveniently sandwiched between Gold's Gym and Spartan Nutrition. I know, ironic. But when I'm in the mood for some high calorie, high fat, and workout killing burger, it's the Gold's and Spartan that whispers in my head \"don't do it\".  And I usually don't.  I usually opt for their Turkey, Chicken, and Fish Burgers.  All are fast, cheap, healthy (depending what you have on it), and surprisingly good.  Carl's is one of those options that won't have leaving with that guilt feeling.  As for service, this had to be one of the better Carl's when it comes to that. Usually no wait here and the staff is friendly.  I don't think too many people eat here because it's a ghost town up here.  Don't let the look of the parking lot or drive through fool you, they are open.  PS:   Sorry Carl's Jr.  I really wanted In-N-Out, but they were closed for Easter.  So, I settled with you guys.  But I learned that you have one killer Alantic Cod Sandwich.  I will be back for that for sure."}
{"text":"This is the slowest, sloppiest Carl's Jr. ever. They make you not want to spend your money .  I work in the complex an I go on my lunch breaks  It  take up to 10-15 min for and old burger and cold fries .. I don't understand. They don't say sorry or even try to throw something extra on . And when you asked them for fresh they get mad and make your stuff sloppy. I'm so over fast food . I'm never coming here again I'll make sure I have my lunch packed every day ..."}
{"text":"Not bad for a late-night place to get a great bite to eat. Obviously there's better in Vegas but for right down the street it's always a good bite and guaranteed good eat"}
{"text":"So I was in the neighborhood at around 9:15 on a Wednesday morning and I noticed that Carl's Jr was open. I walked in figuring I could get a breakfast sandwich of some sort, but I didn't see any breakfast items on the menu. I asked the server - who was evidently in the bathroom at the time - and she told me that location doesn't serve breakfast. (I wanted to ask why the heck an establishment that doesn't serve breakfast was open at 9:00 in the morning, but figured I'd just roll with the punches.)  Instead I decided to go with a burger, having never actually tried anything here before. I eventually settled on The 1/3LB Western Bacon Thickburger, which, as per the website, comes with \"a 1/3lb. Charbroiled Black Angus Beef Patty, Two Strips of Bacon, Melted American Cheese, Crispy Onion Rings and Tangy BBQ Sauce, served on a Fresh Baked Bun.\"  First of all, that \"fresh baked bun\" was incredibly stale. It tasted as though it had been baked the previous morning (if not the morning before that). The American Cheese was not even slightly melted, and the onion rings were soggy. The patty itself tasted as though it came out of one of those meat drawers and had in fact been sitting in there for a few days. It didn't contain even a hint of juiciness.  The tangy BBQ sauce was fine, although it tasted a lot like a generic Bullseye-type sauce. The bacon was microwaved.  All in all, Carl's Jr. is a bit of a disaster. Did I mention this burger cost me almost $10? I didn't get a combo."}
{"text":"1st time eating here Got a burger, fries, hot dog, cookie, and drink for $5 Can't lose with that"}
{"text":"Spent $18.95 on 2 medium fries, fried zucchini, jalapeño poppers, and two famous stars ($3.99 each) The fried zucchini and jalapeño poppers were freshly fried and very good. The famous stars were both cold and we went from the drive thru to our house about 2 miles away. Really already lol  The fries were just basic, nothing special but not to bad.  Very disappointed they took off their sweet potato fries. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First off, my experience is from a drive through perspective only - of which I do often at this location.  Usually it's me and James of Carl's Junior in the morning communicating through the drive through speaker.  James is always professional and nice and I'm always nice back.  I always order a burger as I'm not a big eater of egg items for breakfast.   I almost always have a good experience but now am a little afraid to go back.  I got a \"weird\" burger that I waited forever for this morning and I hope that something wasn't misunderstood between my pal James and I. As far as I know, all correspondence was polite and normal between both parties. The burger I got was smashed beyond an accident and wrapped in that way tight.  I was a little taken back bit the thought hit me right when I took the photo and I wondered of anything else was wrong with it.  So, I paid $7 bucks for a burger and drink in didn't feel comfy finishing.  I am going to be sad without my James and burgers in the morning. I can't imagine why the burger was jacked up like that and ruined.  I just don't feel comfy trying again at this point because I'm obviously the morning burger person...."}
{"text":"I got really sick on Wednesday evening from this Carl's Jr. I ordered the Turkey Burger, asked for no sauce, and it had sauce on it. I spent from 2am till 1pm the next day vomiting, and diarrhea. I'm still dealing with this. I am so pissed, to think they offer a 420 calorie burger and don't listen to their customers. I have reported this to the state health board, and a few others.   DO NOT EAT HERE! I wish I could dump all the crap onto this location. They have not only caused me pain, mental frustration. But time and money from my work. I'm super pissed. I'm glad I finally have some brain power to write this.   DO NOT EAT HERE! Cook at home!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place yesterday and was overall impressed.  Had the original burger combo and tasted similar to burgers from Five Guys or even Hero Burger, and about the same price range as well, ($10-$15 for a combo meal) which is not too bad for this type of food chain.  I did not expect servers to bring the food to you at your table if you dine in which was awesome.     This location was previously a HMV Store and I was also impressed by the renovation for this Carl's Jr, as it had nice decor.  Sort of like of the burger version of Starbucks.    I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to eat on your \"cheat day\" if you are on a certain diet/work out plan.  Oddly enough, I did see a couple of guys who were \"bros\" eat dinner here with their red Goodlife fitness bags, as they joyfully gorged on their burgers & fries meanwhile fist bumping each other due to the satisfaction of the meal.  And then a part of me died inside.  Overall, good burgers."}
{"text":"My visit -- and this story -- start on May 4, 2012. I was shopping for an elderly home-bound neighbor and she asked me to stop at Carl's Jr. to get her a hamburger. Nothing special here; Stopped at the Carl's Jr. and ordered her burger. Paid. Got the food. It wasn't until I asked for the receipt that things got weird. The cashier told me that receipts are only issued on request and it would be a minimum of 5 minutes if I wanted to wait for it. I asked why so long and he said \"That's how long it takes to generate a receipt\".   I am not about to wait 5 minutes for the receipt as the food gets cold. It the order were mine I would have demanded a refund and let them throw the burger in the trash. However, I do feel it necessary to provide a receipt when spending my neighbors money. I left without the receipt and noticed a sticker-sign on the door. Call this number if you have any questions or problems. I called from the parking lot and was connected to the voice mail of someone named Sandra. I left a message explaining what had happened, providing my name and cell number, and asked that I be contacted with information on Carl's receipt policy.  Alas, that is all background information, as the true reason for this review is to document how poor the customer service is and just how unimportant a paying customer is to Carl's Jr. Restaurants. Here is what happened since then:  Using the Carl's website I sent an email through the \"Contact Us\" link. The site specified that a reply could take up to 5 days, a time-frame that seems excessive, but at least they were upfront about the slow reply rate. Maybe they had only a couple people to sift through all of the emails. More likely there were more complaints than any number of people could handle. I regret I can not post my original email, but it was sent from their site, not my email carrier. Alas, I have no access to it. You will have to trust is was much like my phone message requesting a copy of their receipt policy -- let the 5 day clock begin.   -------------------------  On  day 3 I received the following email:  Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us. We do not have any further information for you at this time.  However, I have forwarded your message to the appropriate department for their review and requested that they follow-up on your comments. Please feel free to contact us again at any time.   -------------------------  On  day 6 I sent the following email:  To whom it may concern:  On Friday, May 4th, I sent an email through the \"contact us\" link of your web site. 3 days later I received this auto responder saying that \"We do not have any further information for you at this time\", and I have yet to be informed that there *is* additional information.  My simple request of informing me of your receipt policy was sparked by an oddity on my last visit to Carl's. It is now obvious that the reason neither I, nor other patrons, were given receipts was that the transactions were not rung into the register. Be advised that I no longer need that policy, the reason for which is described below.  * The response time from your web site is long, and in my opinion, unacceptable. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.* * In addition to sending that email I called the telephone number posted on the door and left a voice mail. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.* * A simple request like the one I had originally made should have been handled in under 24 hours. * It is now apparent that customers are a terrible inconvenience to you, therefor, I shall make your jobs easier by cancelling the request for the information and no longer being a customer. The service I have received is equal to that in the restaurant(s). Slow. I shall not bother returning.   -------------------------  On  day 7 I received the following emails:  Thank you for taking the time to contact us.  I assure you that every effort is being made to address this situation.  I have escalated the report concerning your initial comments and these additional comments.  I have contacted the appropriate management regarding your experience at this particular restaurant as well as forwarded your comments to our corporate representatives.  Thank you for giving us the opportunity to address your concerns.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call (877) 799-7827.  -------------------------  And:  My name is Sandra Bacon and I am the District Manager for the store that you vistited (visited) last week. I'm sorry that you did not get my response. It is much easier to have a phone number to call than rely on email. I would like to personally talk to you regarding the reciept (i before e EXCEPT after c) issue. If you would please call me on my cell at 702-561-2101.  Thank you,  Sandra District Manager   Over 6 weeks have passed and I never did that policy!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it is a fluke but the food here just doesn't taste right.  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken, which is my go to sandwich.  However, what i got tasted lukewarm and the chicken was rubbery.  Maybe it's because it's a slow Carl's Jr and the food is old. I don't know, but for almost $10 per combo, I really expected better quality."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. It was freshly cooked and piping hot!  A little long for the drive thru but what can you do. Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"Doesn't seem like they care about the food they serve compared to other Carl's. Second time giving it a shot and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our drive thru order got messed up so we came back. PROPS to the Filipino girl with the shoulder length hair and little ponytail on top. I didn't get her name. If she isn't the manager than I am disappointed. She is such a good leader. She was seriously the only one here doing any work... the two in the back \"cooking\" were just screwing around and she told them multiple times what needed to come out while simultaneously taking nonstop walk ins, drive thru orders, and running to the soda machine in the lobby because theirs was broken. She deserves a fucking raise or a promotion. She's a really hard worker."}
{"text":"Seriously just received the BEST customer service from a fast food restaurant EVER!  The manager who helped me was on point from her friendly, welcoming smile until I left with a sincere Thank You. What a great way to end a somewhat crappy work day."}
{"text":"Okay, okay... I KNOW it's a fast food joint. I KNOW it's a chain. HOWEVER, let me tell you, the ladies who work there are AMAZING. Their customer service is top notch. The store is always exceedingly clean. The food...well, it's Carls' Jr. It's the same food you'll get at any Carl's Jr. But, the staff at THIS one makes it truly a pleasure! I was very pleasantly surprised. Good job girls!!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Carl's Jr ever!! I've been in line at the drive thru for 23 minutes already. I can't go inside because there someone behind me. And because my kid has literally fallen asleep!!!!!!!! The gentleman (later Found out it's Adam) on the intercom is rude and unprofessional from what I can hear of the people in front of me since they are actually getting to order. The car in front of me finally got to order after waiting for the guy to come back for 6 minutes!!!! Unacceptable!!!!! I just sat for 5 minutes at the intercom."}
{"text":"So I don't typically eat at this particular fast food chain but since they have some promotional coupons at the moment I opted for the southwest turkey burger and the jalapeño turkey burger. The proportion is just right-I dislike eating a huge burger because it makes my self-esteem sad. Lol #bodyimagesabotage  Jalapeño burger: boy does this have kick! But I'm an idiot constantly thinking I can handle eating jalapeños when I know my taste buds can't handle it. Masochist dining. Fortunately I didn't suffer a runny nose. The lettuce didn't seem as fresh as the southwest burger.    Southwest burger: it's a bit messy but I like this one better than the jalapeño one. Maybe it's because of the sauce or maybe it's because it's messy and I can imitate all the other A-List celebrity Carl's Jr commercials and lick my fingers and lips.   Cross-cut fries: greasy like all true fast good fries. The initial bite is always good but the aftertaste-I no like! I hate that icky feeling of having grease on the roof of your mouth."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch today with my wife.  I really like the burgers here and we like to come here because the staff is usually so helpful.  Today's experience was not the norm for us (at least compared to other locations).  The staff was not properly trained on the register, the manager on duty was rude (she did not want to give us a side of bbq sauce).  The food is good, but go to another location for better service."}
{"text":"Tasteless, overlooked burger for $6!  Last trip to tis place."}
{"text":"We got a coupon for the Redhook Beer Battered Cod fish sandwich. The picture of it looked amazing. I see so many tv commercials for their food, and decided why not!  We were pretty excited to try this sandwich. Well, it looked nothing like the photo...no surprise since it is fast food, nor was it very good   This sandwich has lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. This sandwich was drowning in sauce. It was a huge, gloppy mess. Between that and the lettuce and tomato, there was not much flavor at all. No fish sandwich taste at all. Finally, I just ate the fish filet by itself. It was actually decent. Not sure that I would get this again, but if I did I would request this without lettuce, tomato, as well as ask for less sauce. Oh, and maybe add cheese."}
{"text":"The service is horrible and staff have very bad attitudes.  I ordered a #1 with no cheese. When the order was repeated the young lady did not repeat no cheese on the burger. I asked her if there was no cheese on the burger and she responded with an attitude that its a famous star burger. When I approached the window there was no greeting.  I looked at my receipt and she put it in as a famous star with cheese so I checked the food and cheese was on the burger.  I parked my car and went inside the store and approached an older lady that was a worker and explained to her the situation.  She was very apologetic and offered me to change the order, but I just wanted a refund.   She was unsure on how to process a refund so she asked the manger. The guy was very rude and short with the employee.  I think it was very inappropriate to be that way in front of customers.  Not to mention my refund will take 3-5 days to get back on my card.  Horrible service and customer service from some of the employees."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday ,poor service ,bad food cooked wrong and spoiled meat .i have been throwing up and shits all nite and today .with all the other places close by I will be going anywhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Quick lunch and your coupons are expired, don't worry this Carl's has your back.   Many options and salads too."}
{"text":"First off, the drive thru girl was either brand new or just confused as hell. Read my order back completely incorrectly.  Then finally musters up that what I ordered was out. Ok, I pick something else.  I get my order and see that I have regular fries when I asked for seasoned. I mention this to The girl and she says \"seasoned? Aren't they the same?\" I tell her no, the criss cut fries are seasoned. \"Oh\" she says. Someone overhears and tells me I'll have to wait for them to be fried.  I say nevermind and leave.  When I get home the onion rings in everyone's burgers are hard as rocks.   I mean, just completely unprepared. Old onion rings, out of stuff, incompetent staff. Sigh."}
{"text":"Worst Carl's Jr. I've ever been to. So expensive. I ask for a 5 price chicken tenders and I get scraps. Waited in line for 10 minutes. What kore needs to be said. Will. Never go back here!"}
{"text":"I love the salads here, and that's why I come, but, won't be coming back to this location. Every time I come to this location, it's a wait, or bad service.  Came in here a few weeks ago and there was 1 car ahead of me. I didn't leave the drive thru until 30 minutes later. First it took them 20 minutes to put the salad in the bag and hand it to me. Then upon handing it to me they told me they were out of forks. Cool, I guess, but, how am I supposed to eat this, with my hands ??   I asked for my money back, but instead they attempted to look for forks, took forever. Then they came up and said forks will be coming out soon, they said that they were going to run to el supor and buy some.I asked AGAIN for my money back and they finnally gave it back to me. I wasn't going to wait in line for them to buy that if it took them 20 minutes just to hand a salad to me. I used to work in drive thru, I know that drive thru takes priority, and that was a rediculous wait considering the line was so small."}
{"text":"Got a coupon for a FREE CHICKEN Sandwich from the company because of another SCREW UP at another store.  When I order the Chicken Sandwich that costs $4.59 the guy tells me $1.69, I'M LIKE WTF!!!!!!!!!! Yes it does say you must pay the tax but what is the DAMN TAX on 4.59???????????????????????????????  I WILL NEVER GO TO CARL'S JR EVER AGAIN. Carl Jr is synonymous with a few choice CURSE WORDS I CAN THINK OF."}
{"text":"Typical Carl's Jr.  It's clean.  Overpriced for fast food.  There is an elderly woman who works here that is really sweet.  Some of the other staff isn't all that friendly though.  The steakhouse burger is delicious.  I hope they keep it for a while.  I love onion straws and I love bleu cheese.  The soda machine has a good number of selections.  I think coke zero is one if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Spent lunch with my son here Chris one of the servers/cashiers was crazy nice and super helpful  He asked if he could fill my drink and take my trash.... No one asks that! I'm def stopping here again"}
{"text":"Drive thru service.  Prompt and polite.  I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.  Hehehe. Ordered my Santa Fe Chicken sandwich and asked for it to be cut in half, so that'll be the biggest test."}
{"text":"Love Carl's Jr.  Glad there is a location a bit closer to us. Breakfast today starts with a Hardee's breakfast biscuit sandwich."}
{"text":"Yum.  Best tasting fast food in AZ is at Carl's Jr. I always received good service at this location and it's usually faster than any other Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. Is ok but it's not the best I get a shake with some chicken stars it's good but not good as other places but thx Carl's Jr. For the good food"}
{"text":"Creepy drive thru guy named Tim practically crawled out the window to tell me I had a very beautiful smile. Turned off the drive thru lights and stared at me the whole time I waited for my food. Will not be going back there again. Ever."}
{"text":"Ordered two $6 low carb turkey burgers to go. The guy who took our order was very pleasant, they seemed a bit understaffed. The whole place was empty of customers, and this is a busy area.  Got our burgers home and they were the saddest, wilty lettuced, haphazardous looking  burgers ever. Maybe worth  $6 in Venezuela. 3 stars because after some home fixings, it was delicious."}
{"text":"I am a repeat visitor to this location, (next to harbor freight tools!) and have repeatedly (12x or more) had lunch or dinner.  Never crowded when I go, clean bathrooms and quick service.   discounts if you ask."}
{"text":"consistently soggy burgers.  been there 3 times in the last 3 months, so skipping this one."}
{"text":"This place fuken blows, they're customer service sux ass n really slow. They walk slow when they're preparing orders. I think they're high or under the influence of some. But all i know i they sure take they're sweet ass time. Some people gotta go vak to work u know? Never coming bak to this location."}
{"text":"Here I sit in the parking lot waiting for them to open. Sign on the door states they open at 6am it's now 6:20 am and no one in site.  All I want is to try the sausage egg biscuits"}
{"text":"This is the best Carl's close to me. Super quick. Nice drive thru person. Fries where dope and so was the burger. Thanks good people of Carl's!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it's the second time my order has been screwed up! I ordered two western bacons both with NO cheese, and of course I didn't check, there's cheese on both and soaked in BBQ sauce! I'm not sure if the people making the sandwiches hate their job but man that's horrible. If you don't like the place you work in find another job! Never again bringing my business here!"}
{"text":"I usually get drive through here. Their cheese burgers with bacon are the best and their fries are amazing. The service is good most of the time. They even have onion rings which are to die for. The place overall is good and it's always good to come here and try new things. Recommend for anyone who loves bacon."}
{"text":"Customer service was fine. Restaurant appeared clean. However, the fountain sprite was flat. And, although I had requested pickles on my turkey burger and they appeared on the receipt, the burger had no pickles. Not a big deal really, but it's still disappointing along with the flat sprite."}
{"text":"Before volunteering at St Mary's Food Bank, I used Yelp to find a fast food place and came across Carl's Jr. Read the one review and I was sold.  The worker's there have an infectious, enthusiastic attitude, friendly and want to make your dining experience enjoyable.  I had the Western Bacon Burger which was well worth the $8 for the combo. It included the $6 burger. When is the last time you had the burger bulging out of the bun? The only negative was the shape of the french fries. I like them a lot thinner. If they had shoe string fries, it would be a killer combination. The burger came wrapped like In & Out Burger, not in a cardboard box. The seating area was clean and modem with two color TV's set on the ESPN stations. At one end of the seating area, there was one worker mopping the floor. I've never seen such pride in what they do to keep the place in tip top condition."}
{"text":"I love Carls Jr, but the hamburger was put together sloppy. When did they start using square buns?? And to top it off it was stale. Brought it back and got a round  bun, but that didn't help the experience. Just couldn't eat any more and dumped my meal in the trash.  The soda fountain was running out of several sodas. They looked like were short handed, but there was an elderly employee taking her break in the eating area.  This place was much better than before, but it has gone the tubes. Scratch this location off my list. Adios!!"}
{"text":"I waited 15mins in drive thru. It was only two cars ahead of me. If there wasn't a car behind me I would of just pulled out and went somewhere else to eat just a FYI!"}
{"text":"Never changes, expensive, dirty tables. I guess Management never looks at Yelp.  Funky air vent smell at back of restaurant.  Big Carl burger was good."}
{"text":"GO TO JACK-IN-THE-BOX INSTEAD.   I wish I could say something nice about this location. I have been trying to to find value at Carl's Jr. For more than 20 years!   Tonight I had a coupon for a Buy One Get One free Famous Star. I asked for extra lettuce and tomatoes. I was charged 60 cents for lettuce and 60 cents for tomatoes for the two hamburgers.   I was not happy when I got my meal. The lettuce and was an amount I would consider should be on  regular Famous Star.   Each hamburger had two tomatoes.  Wow! How generous.   I asked for more tomatoes and lettuce. No luck. The manager would rather lose a longtime customer rather than give out two slices of tomatoe. Very short sighted customer service.   I guess they don't really are about their customers satisfaction.   So, with this event in mind I would like to recommend going to Jack-in-the-Box across the street: MUCH BETTER VALUE, and a lot cheaper.   If, we stop eating at Carl's Jr, maybe they'll get the hint and develop a little common sense regarding value and customer service.   Jack-in-the-Box thats where I am going!"}
{"text":"Every once in awhile, after work or life has been stressing you out, you've just got to scratch the itch with fast junk food.  This place fit the bill for me tonight.  I ate the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  It wasn't anything special but it was reasonably priced and they made it quick.  The BBQ sauce was unfortunately bland, but that's probably so it appeals more to the masses.  I now have a hamburger shaped lump in my stomach....and as after any act of mindless passion, I regret my actions.  :)"}
{"text":"I tried their grilled portobello mushroom thick burger and they were as good as it gets! Nothing beats anything grilled if it's grilled with charcoal anyways."}
{"text":"Came to this location at 7:30 on a Monday night as the third car in line in the drive thru. We waited 20 minutes in the drive thru and over 5 minutes at the window. The first employee didn't apologize for or even mention the long wait. She did, however, give us a 10% (77 cent) discount, which was nice. The second employee (maybe the manager?) was very apologetic and gave us large fries instead of the small we originally ordered and three free cookies. While this was great, everything was thrown into the bag without care so all the fries spilled out into the bottom of the bag and the cookies fell out of their holders and also into the bottom of the bag. Probably won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Went there with the family. Great service with even greater food. I will come back to this location and strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"On a morning driving back to mi casa from my boyfriend's casa I was in dire need of coffee as he doesn't even have a coffee maker nor does he drink coffee! Yes, insanity, I know. Anyway, I pulled into the Starbucks down the street from this Carl's Jr and I was met with a loooong drive-thru line.  I let me impatience get the best of me and swung over to this Carl's Jr. to get a coffee. I really was only going to get a coffee, but the lady over the intercom asked me if I wanted to try their new \"Country Burrito\". Hrmmm, okay I said, make it a combo then.  And then I waited... and waited.... and waited. Fast food anyone? Not here. Finally she came back with my burrito, coffee, and little hash-brown rounds. I was so excited for my coffee I dumped the two Splendas and Creamers I ordered into the cup and took a sip. YUUUUCCKKK. Their coffee has some sort of flavoring in it. I wish I had known this ahead of time or I wouldn't have dumped MORE sugar in it. Also, the burrito was not good. I ended up having a few bites and giving it to my mom.  Slow service, bad coffee, bad breakfast burrito. Meh! I'll stick to McDonald's if I need a fast food morning fix."}
{"text":"Lindsay drove thru wait I've ever had, and there was only one car in front of me! Something needs to be done about proper staffing."}
{"text":"Today I actually got really crappy service.  I know what good service is from Carl's Jr and we have been coming to this one for the past 2 plus years.  And my brother used to work here over 2 decades ago when we were in college.  Oh, I wrote that before.  Oops.  Today, Guadalupe (I think that's her name) served us at the drive through.  She is fairly new that I can tell of the past couple weeks.  She never smiles and is always curt.  Today, upon buying 3 large drinks (and I wasn't happy that the prices went up on this, too to $1), I handed her my debit card and my daughter's school ID.  She said she cannot accept the school ID and that I will not be getting a 10% on the drinks.  She said they are already discounted.  I said they raised the prices like about a week ago.  She told me the drinks are normally $2.50.  I don't think they've been that price in ever, not even in Vegas are they this much.  She said we were already getting a discount and they don't do discounts on their $1 menu.  I said, well, the sign right there said, they always give 10% to students (with IDs), veterans, military, senior citizens.  Then, she went on to say, it's only for the veterans and military that they will give 10% off.  Anyway, she refused and it's not even that I need or even care about the stupid 30 cents, but the principle.  I told her yesterday I got the 10% off, but she didn't address that.  How they she say they only give 10% off to military when the sign there clearly says to whom.  And, the sign does not have an asterisk stating that the 10% is for certain items only.  We frequently other Carl Jr's around the valley and have always gotten the 10% off our drinks or whatever we are buying.  Anyway, I'm really ticked and called another Carl's that is closer to our house that we go to.  They said they always give the 10% if you show your ID for those groups no matter what you buy.  I will be calling this Carl's Jr and complaining about her and see if this is true, that they will not honor the 10%.  If they don't, then they will completely lose all our business.  Guadalupe also said all the other fast food restaurants charge $2.50 also. Well, that's absolutely not true - I checked the large drinks with Burger King, Chipotle's, Dairy Queen, Subway, McDonald's, Jack in the Box, KFC, Wendy's, Whataburger, Arby's, Sonic, Rally's, In & Out, Panda Express and NONE of these places charge $2.50 for their large drink.  I think one of the places even offered a 1.5 liter for maybe $2.29 or something like that.  Anyway, I will be voicing my complaint to this Carl's for her rudeness, for stating things that she just made up, for being very non customer service oriented.  My husband said I should have refused the drinks and I should have, but I was in a rush."}
{"text":"PROS:  - Most of the food is very tasty for the price.  For drive-thru fast food, their burgers are some of my favorite. - They have really good unsweetened ice tea here for $1.  Also, their spicy chicken sammich is pretty tasty when you consider it is only $1 too.   CONS: - I hate their \"grilled\" chicken salad with a passion.  I don't know what mush they put into the \"chicken\", but the only items that can be distinguished are the fatty / gritty bits of chicken. No. Thank. You.  - Drive through at this location suuuuucks during the work week lunch rush.  - Some of the food is a little too greasy (not just this location though, in general).  For fast food, it is good/acceptable (as long as you don't come during lunch time during the week or order the salads!!)."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, this area is totally thug life: do not get out of your car if possible.   However -- out of all of the Carl's Jr locations I have been to, this one has the best food and the nicest staff.  They have never made an error on our order, the ice tea is delicious (and cheap!), the food is hot and fresh, and if I am unfortunate enough to be in the area again --- I will totally go back here for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I'm very concerned about the food safety with this place, I have seen some very questionable things go on here.  It's also always un godly cold in here."}
{"text":"Long story short every employee at this location needs to be fired. Worst customer service ever. They refused to serve my wife and I and ended kicking us out of the dinning area."}
{"text":"The service in this place is terrible. The man in front of me asked what was in the $4 meal beat. The counter jerk told him to \"go look on the window sign outside\". That is a direct quote. When my wife complained about how her sandwich was prepared she was told to \"call and complain\". Not only will I not return, but I will also trash this place to anyone who will listen. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"I pulled up the drive through at 11:50pm on Saturday March 4th. All the lights were on and I saw a female worker behind the counter with a headset on. I sat there for 5 minutes. Even talked to speaker and tried to get anyone attention. At 11:56 all the lights turned off and was informed they were unable to serve me. Close wasn't until midnight. I am very disappointed I has to wait that long for anyone to even tell me they are too lazy to serve customers."}
{"text":"Definitely surprised. I rarely eat fast food but was starving on this particular day and had to stop. Had the new natural burger, not sure  if it's the pregnancy hormones talking but it was delicious and actually tasted like a real burger from a real restaurant. Not some slapped together junk. super friendly customer service. I'll be back when I have a rare fast food craving."}
{"text":"I pulled up through the drive thru to get some food. Asked them what time they closed and they said 10 minutes. I said I was alright and said I don't wanna big them and thanked her and she made sure that I ordered. It wasn't a pain for her and she genuinely wanted me to order even though they were about o close. I pulled around and talked with Marisa or Melissa. Forgetting her name already but she was super friendly, had great customer service and is a hard worker. If this woman isn't a manager, she sure deserves to be one."}
{"text":"Omg can someone explain what's so hard to punch information as you given it! Like I tell the guy at the drive thru I want a burger no pickle no mustard he repeats it I drive to the window when I'm paying I ask again no pickle. No mustard she looks at the screen as reading then say yeah no mustard no pickles she hands me my receipt no where does it say that so when I get it I ask again she say right so I check to find mustard n pickles I get it replace drive off to come back because I for my drinks...find out they had also missed giving g me a burger and the dipping sauce oh which they only had one ranch!!! I don't know why I keep coming here!!! Sorry for any typos this too so long this review was done while I was waiting at drive thru!!!"}
{"text":"We pulled up to have our order taken in the drive through at 12am. This is our convo  \"are you ready to order?\"  \"Um no give us a minute. \" \"Okay we're ready\"   Silence.  \"We'd like a grilled cheese cheeseburger\" \"anything else\"  \"I'd like a western burger\" \"Anything else\" \"Order of waffle fries\" \"Anything else\" \"Banana chocolate chip shake\" \"Anything else\" \"No thank you\"  We drove around to the window and realized we didn't get a drink...she decides to be nice at this point. It's pretty often you get 'tude when you add on at the window. She added it gave us our total and our food came out pretty fast. Our burgers were great. The banana chocolate chip shake, although fake, was delish!! I do not like imitation banana at all. My hubby looooves it and right away told me I wouldn't like it! But it went the other way I wanted it for myself ;) the waffle fries are my fave they were hot when we got home even!! So was the order taker friendly? Not till the end. I don't really choose fast food restaurants by service though. If she had been a little nicer I would have probably given 5 stars because there wasn't a single flaw in our food and it was 12am!"}
{"text":"3 stars because it's convenient place to go when I'm heading home and open 24 hours. I normally end up ordering with a cashier Penelope but today I got Jennifer she was really nice also. Why am I reviewing a fast food place? Because everyone deserves some recognition no matter where they work. Penelope has always been really nice no matter how late it is."}
{"text":"Very poor first and last experience. Mine and two other customers had orders that were not correct and then forget to replace mine. Got a refund and got out after 30 minutes of wasting my time in a lengthy line up with nothing but a headache to show for it. Steer clear, could be in for a long wait until they get their systems down. Expected far better in a new frontier."}
{"text":"blanca was the most disrespectful manager in charge. i just asked for extra buffalo and ranch. i didnt mind paying  for it as a matter of fact i paid $10 extra for it. she was so disrespectful telling me  i was intoxicated with no proof and refused my serviced being so that i have been an employee of cale's jr, & i have worked the drive thru myself.  never in my life have i treated a guest like this no matter of the circumstances. blanca needs to take another management class because her employee  treat us better than herself.  blanca even threaten us to call the cops for us wanting our order. we left in peace  because we didn't do anything."}
{"text":"About 5 years ago, I moved from among the gorgeous vistas of San Francisco to the towering concrete jungle of New York City. On the Isle of Manhattan, when you are smashed from the beer and tequila at Therapy (a gay bar... or your therapists office, too, I guess), you have Lucky Burger and that's about it. (It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's also about $10 to get out of there with a burger.)  Some would argue that they have Burger King, Wendy's, McDonald's and White Castle, but I would argue that there is a difference between meh fast food and holy-shit-this-burger-just-blew-up-my-face fast food.  WE HAD NO CARL'S JR, IN N OUT or JACK IN THE BOX IN NYC!  Like WTF?  So, before I had to go on a stupid diet, this was my go to place for burgers over the past 3 months since I've relocated to the Vegas area.   Superstar with Cheese or bust, because if it's not a superstar, it's just a star, and I'd rather have superman in my mouth than just any man.  It should be illegal for any state to be without a Carl's Jr. #LukesLaws"}
{"text":"Don't go here at night. They stop selling half the menu after 11pm but they are open 24hours. If you want high priced fast food topped with old dirty lettuce this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Your typical Carl's Jr.    Though, we DID order a six dollar burger and a chicken club (they were out of both types of meat at the time, though, believe it or not).  I will say that the guy at the drive through window (I went sometime around 1AM) was exceptionally nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Nice change from McDonald's. Takes a while to get your order but in return you get hot, fresh food. Burger is pretty good."}
{"text":"Grossest hamburger I've ever had!  The texture reminded me of really cheap chicken nuggets.  Very expensive, given the horrendous quality.  Avoid at all costs!  There are so many good hamburger places on Queen Street, there really is no need to go here."}
{"text":"Despite the location, this carls jr is amazing! I've been in other Carl's jr's in nicer locations, but the customer service at this one can't be beat! The people here are very nice, polite, and welcome you when you walk in.  From walk in to receiving my food only took about 5 minutes during lunch hour and there was 1 person in line ahead of me."}
{"text":"Its Carl's Jr. What you'd expect going into a fast food establishment, with a step up. To get a good meal (burger, fries, drink) look to pay $9 - $12. Surprisingly the drive through is relatively quick, for being fresh made as you order food."}
{"text":"Our first time here- stopped after a day at the Botanical Gardens. Since we don't have this where we live, we figured we had to stop. Burgers were good. Reminds us of Burger King, which is good because it wasn't \"greasy\". I am also diabetic and I was super excited when there was more than one option of a \"diet\" soda!"}
{"text":"Food was just as it was supposed to be and had my order and my food within 5 min.  Not sure what was going on with all the unhappy reviews.  Maybe they came during a lunch rush?  I'm here at 11:15 am and couldn't be happier.  The service was great too.  Nice smile and courteous."}
{"text":"A little understaffed in the morning, but the Monster Biscuit is the best breakfast sandwich around! Two eggs, cheese, bacon, AND sausage on one of Carl Jr.'s great biscuits! Don't tell my cardiologist!"}
{"text":"Weak as fuck ...order a malt and they basicly give me chocolate  milk wtf ... Dude they put zero fuckin ice cream in it should of got money back and shake remade teach your lazy ass employees  to make a shake two times came here and it was like this fuckin bullshit"}
{"text":"I come here after my son's t-ball practice 1 / week. 2 consecutive visits now, I've waited at the order \"window\" for over 5 minutes. The last time we were in the drive thru we waited for a total of 25 minutes. The excuse was that they were \"under staffed\". This time I waited for 7 minutes and we hadn't even ordered yet when I had to ask them what was going on that I had to wait that long. This time it was \"technical difficulties\" and when I asked how much longer the wait was she said at least another 5 minutes because she was just now rebooting the machine. She said I could wait if I wanted to, \"or not\". So I left. Won't be back. Terrible service - long waits."}
{"text":"After working all day and running errands, I was hungry and needed a fast meal to satisfy my hunger. Carl's Jr., hit the spot.     It's hard to believe that the last time I ate in a Carl's Jr. was over six years ago at the Tropicana at Sandhill location before I jumped on the Yelp train. Over six years later the Western cheeseburger tastes just as yummy as it did before 2011. In my opinion  this is Carl Jr's signature sandwich. The beef topped with cheese, barbecue sauce, and onion rings gives some of these so-called burger full-service restaurants a run for their money.     Carl's Jr. also gives some full-service restaurants a run for their money in customer service. Immediately upon walking inside, the man at the counter greeted me and was patient as I decided what I wanted. After ordering the western cheeseburger combo, I brought my food to the Coke machine, filled my drink, and sauntered to the table with my number. I had brought along a bag of groceries because I wanted to get exercise instead of constant driving. However, the manager noticed at the Coke machine that the bag was ripping and volunteered to bring me a new bag. I'd take Carl's Jr., up on the offer. Another offer I'd take up was the delicious Fanta strawberry soda that is one of the Coke fountain beverages. It was a compliment to the Western cheeseburger and fries medium sized.      My bill for the medium sized Western cheeseburger meal with a Coke beverage and fries came to $8.41. This is one of the least expensive items on the Carl's Jr., menu. As far as spending $8.41 on a meal, this is not the best deal. From my experience the Chinese lunch specials, Hawaiin blue plate specials, and some sub restaurants are the best deal. But tell that to me after a day of work and errands.      As I write this on the weekend of America's Birthday, it is the year of Carl Jr's 75th Birthday. They must be doing something right to make it to their 75th Anniversary. Their Western cheeseburger is one of the things that Carl Jr., does right."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru. I order a vanilla milk shake and bacon cheddar fries.  To begin with it took about 15-20 from me ordering to get to the window to pay and get my food, there was 2 cars ahead of me.   I get to the window, I pay, I get my food I go in my way. I get home (not even a 5 minute drive) and I open my fries, they are not only cold but the bacon that was on them was ice cold as if it was frozen and not even cooked. There was also no cheese on the fries whatsoever.  I call the store and tell them this, and I got told \"that's not possible we make sure that all of our food is cooked before giving it to customers\" I even offered to drive back up there and bring it to show them, which I get told that won't be necessary because there's nothing they can do."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through today and order my meal with only mayonnaise. I get to the window to pay for my meal and over year the cashier say to the cook Only mayonnaise. He says well I already put ketchup and mustard! I had a feeling as if they were talking about my order since I was the only one there and no one was at the counter. I pay and get handed my food and drive to the front and open my burger and sure enough my burger has ketchup and mustard! No mind you my hands were already on this burger! I unload the kids walk into the store and tell them my burger was wrong and got an apology never mind the fact that the one whom serviced me already knew the burger was wrong and clearly didn't care enough to fix the problem! So the different cashier that takes the burger I already touched and puts it back on the line now I don't work in fast food anymore but I know it's common sense to throw food away that has been touched but apparently they missed the memo! So within not even 2 minutes I'm handed another burger with cheese that's not even melted. I think this location needs better employees and better health standards. Last time I had touched French fries that were supposed to be onion rings and they put those back as well. I thought that was a one time mistake but NOPE"}
{"text":"Haha had to only give a star to comment! I ordered a #1 yes a famous star with cheese and burger... to get home to no burger patty in my cheeseburger! WTH you had one job!? Never going back hopefully they get experience burger makers.. lol"}
{"text":"FYI-    The manager hangs out in the front and takes orders and chats with customers because he's actually watching the employees    Every time I go there my order is messed up  or taste crappy, And the manager knows this he knows my face and he knows every time I come there it's messed up   Today got the steakhouse burger that looked absolutely nothing remotely like the picture.  Spoke to the manager and told him about his management and  lazy or unhappy employees.  Never going back to this location going to wait till the one opens up in Aliante.  Also, last time I had issue management told me that he was brought in because of issues at that location.  Hey man, how's that working for you"}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken sandwich and this is what I got, i didn't bother eating whatever that was. Also they got my order wrong and when I called back to speak to the manager and told her about my experience she could careless. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"nasty ass trash ass food on moms worst service ever to my name is robert ponce yell my name out"}
{"text":"Asked the drive person if their gravy from the Biscuit and Gravy had any meat in it and she said no. Come home and two bites in I find the sausage pieces. You guys should know what's in your food."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. location probably has the best service I've ever received at a fast food establishment.  Immediately after entering we were greeted with a cheerful \"Welcome to Carl's Jr.!\"  The cheerful demeanorwas carried by all of the employees leading to a pleasing experience.  Food came out fast and warm, and we were allowed to use a coupon even though we had already ordered and paid.  Halfway through lunch the employee that took our order came by the table and asked if there was anything she should get us.    As for food, I had the portobello $6 burger.  It's a big burger, but they don't skimp on the mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms with melty swiss cheese make this seem like this burger didn't come from a fast food restaurant.  I never thought I'd review a fast food restaurant, but seriously, service with a smile certainly does make an experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Great deals and food quality here. I always come trough the drive-through and request to make sure is fresh after having gotten some cold food one time.   Try the #16 $5 Box with hot dog, Cheeseburger and fries. Good bargain at 5 bucks for all that plus cookie and drink. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Fast food is supposed to be fast.  The food prep was, but the line (of three people) took way too long. Perhaps the manager who was standing around doing nothing could've taken an order. Extra star because I haven't had Carl's Jr. since I moved back east."}
{"text":"I am second in line in the drive thru right now and been here for 15 min, so let's see if I can finish this review before I move. I can't even imagine how long the dude in front of me been here  The food here is good. There is no complaint there. The main complaint is the wait time. You can have the simplest order and they will take long time to make it. You'll be better waiting in line at the in-n-out down the street and get a better burger while your at it. The wait time is torturous. It's not really \"fast food\".  Any in case you are wondering, I'm still in the same spot in line as when I started. Good job there guys"}
{"text":"It also has a Green Burrito. I love to order inside instead of the drive thru so that I can take some salsa and pico de gallo with me to put on my burger and fries."}
{"text":"This place never opens on time, workers pulling up at the time thay are all ready supposed to be open, whats the use of saying you are open at a certain time when your not, if you cant open on  tome then change the hours, this happens, been here a couple of times and ended up going somewhere else so this is not a one time thing that the workers were just late apparently it's like this, why does the manager not do something or the manager is also the problem...and these people want more money to do this job, please they hardly get the orders right, not on time and most of the time are rude. Wont be back here."}
{"text":"first said I wanted a plain chicken sandwich 3 times but first I get one with process cheese I said plane then she gives me another one the 3rd time its was a burger And I did not order that she Says I said that No I did not I don't remember her name but it said general manager on her name tag she is  real ignorant and slow how incompetent can some one be alien managers can never do anything right"}
{"text":"So this place has come apart like a $2 watch. Staff is friendly, I will give them that. But the restroom today was FILTHY & DISGUSTING. (see photo) Order was correct, but hash-browns were COLD and I had to take them back and ask for fresh ones. Ugh!"}
{"text":"We want a month and a half ago, and will never be back! Mind you if you like McDonald's this might be a step up! But if you like five guys or south street burger there is no comparison! Yes burgers are cheaper than the others I mentioned and their patties are slightly bigger than a Mcdonald's patty, I find no flavour! I hated the fries and was not my favourite place! My husband likes the build a burger at McDonald's way better! I would have to say try it for yourself as I see a 5 star rating from another review!"}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of fast food reviews, but I see that Carl's has gotten s few recent poor reviews, so I wanted to throw in my compliments.  This is actually my go-to fast food place in Old Town.  My food has ALWAYS been fresh, and I don't think they've ever messed up my order.  Their burgers are great, and they have the best fast food chicken tenders around.  Onion rings are fantastic too.  Except for the hash browns, I think they beat McDonald's when it comes to breakfast.  They even have a breakfast burger, which is pretty ridiculous...and I mean that in the best way possible!  Finally, the employees have always been friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"30 minutes to get through a 4 car deep drive through because of only one kid working said his help was on break. Must get long breaks! Understaffed and wasting my time!"}
{"text":"They make the burgers the best here. They take their time. They cook it just right and never leave out anything that I have asked or paid for. Out of all the Carls Jr I make my way to this one if its not too far out of the way because I know I will enjoy my meal!"}
{"text":"So saw lots of commercials last night for the western bacon cheeseburger about 12 to 15 of them within a 2 hour period. Made my stomach growl so I told myself I would go get one for lunch today. The strips of bacon, melted cheese, onion rings and patty on the commercial made it so tempting. I head to this Carl's Jr and the drive thru gentlemen was very pleasant. He gave us large drinks because they ran out of cups, which was nice. They didn't have ranch which was odd, but he also said they ran out. I ordered the western bacon cheese burger meal and my gf ordered the chicken bacon club. I made a joke as we were driving home that I bet they ran out of regular size parties and onion rings. We both laughed, but to my surprise when I get home there is bacon bits instead of strips of bacon, 2 small pattys instead of their charbroiled full size patty, and mini onion rings. Lol this place can't even keep their products stocked for their burgers they advertise on television.."}
{"text":"Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Shout out to the new manager.. service was fast and food was delicious. Don't let me forget to mention all the smiles I walked in to. They were polite and even asked me how my day was. A month back the old manager was extremely disrespectful, my food tasted awful so I tried to complain and she asked me to leave!! SOO Shout out to the manager for introducing herself with a big ol smile on her face and for the cook who cooked my delicious food. I will return for note"}
{"text":"Cashier wouldn't accept my valid coupon that expires in 5 days because he \"don't know how to enter it\" and he \"has other customers\" total waste of time for a bait and switch.. they should have competent staff and be embarrassed to use these types of tactics."}
{"text":"I've been away from AZ for the last year, and there is no Carls Junior in Florida where I now reside. Been wanting a Western Bacon Cheeseburger for a few months now.. I'm the only person in line, place my order with a little extra BBQ Sauce... I guess it doesn't matter if they are busy or slow, because my burger was less than desirable. Poorly put together, burger leaning off the bun, NO Extra BBQ sauce. How hard is it. The order taker confirmed I wanted EXTRA BBQ sauce... WTS !!!! Maybe I should have went to Jack-N- The Box."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night. It was pretty busy not too busy. As soon as I pulled up to the window the guy inside says he sick of helping these \"fucking\" customers. The guy looked dead at me and knew I heard him. I drove off and will not come back here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing a Carls, but here it goes.  I know this is fast food/chain restaurant.  I don't care, cause Carl's is good stuff.  This location is a Green Burrito location, whatever that means, but I think that all it means is that they serve a few Mexican dishes here.  I usually stop here at the drive through, and rarely go into the lobby itself.  I usually order the Carl Star, or as of lately, the Breakfast burger, which is tasty.  Its fast food folks, but in my eyes, anything but McDonalds is okay by me.  I will return for their Breakfast burgers and Carls Star burger any day!"}
{"text":"I would stay away from this Store. They do not care for you . They just want your money.   Have never seen people just not care so well its like their job to not give a damn about you"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab something to eat, asked for a breakfast burritos, but they were no longer serving breakfast, ok no problem, I asked for a Hawaiian chicken sandwich, they only had 1 piece of chicken left, couldn't make my sandwich. I decided I was done. Walked out. Won't be back"}
{"text":"PLZ DONT GO THERE!!! FirSt of all I want to say that. This place is Fuckn HORRIBLE!!! (Sorry for the bad words) I been living in Vegas for a year already and this place is really close to my house so I just been there like 3 times, well the few times I have been there my order was messed up they charged me for fries and did not put them in the bag of course I call to let them know being nice I told them that my fries where not in the bag and the lady told me she didn't charge me for fries but said I can go by and pick some fries up that same day or the next ( ok so who says that and still offer to give free food lmao) anyways I just told her no thank you but to be more careful next time.... Second time I go (believe it or not) they forgot to put in the PATTY!!!! Wtf ... So again call them and said they didn't put in the patty and the lady said that I was lying!! WOW WHY WOULD I DO THAT!!!  Freaken burger was 7 dlrs! And of course I went back for either my money back or a burger...(mayb spit in it) oh well... So without arguing they gave me a burger and asked to look inside to see for myself that there is a patty! Hahaha these ppl are so unprofessional so rude, vulgar and liars!!! I am so not going there EVER!!! I would give this place a ---5 stars... Horrible. Annoying.. And nasty... My experiences at this carls jr are the worst I had.oh and she didn't want to give me a receipt and said I can look it up in my statement!! Hahaha... This has always been after 7pm."}
{"text":"My husband went to this location this evening, ordered food, waited in a long ass drive thru line to find out that they ran out of bread!!!! Who runs out of bread?? Why are they not prepared!?? Even the other times we come to this location, they always screw something up and there's always, ALWAYS a VERY LONG WAIT!!! The only reason why we did come here is because it was convenient. But now we know not to. There's another one on Craig. Don't waste your time going to this one. Trust me, it'll save you time. Too bad I had to give them 1 star. They don't even deserve that 1 star"}
{"text":"The Steakhouse Burger is BEST burger I have ever had!!!! Blue cheese, A-1 steak-sauce with the onion pieces, freaking amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about unfriendly. Gina working the drive thru needs an attitude adjustment. Sorry I made you work? If you hate working you can quit. Learn how to smile too. Just rubs me the wrong way when I smile and am nice and I'm greeted with someone with a crap attitude. She seemed so put off that I spent money there. Man, maybe I shouldn't have."}
{"text":"Really a bad location.  I have never encountered so many rude employees.  I've gone a few times, and I order a simple egg and cheese biscuit. Now I get it, it's not on the menu so this lends itself to a few slip ups when putting it into the system.  I try to be patient and always let them know, that I would like an egg and cheese biscuit please.  The last time I went the drive thru employee even repeated it back.  Perfect!  Nope.  Instead I got a sausage patty on the sand which.  I wasn't rude, but asked the girl if I could please have them make me an egg and cheese, and not sausage as she put on the receipt. She had the bag behind her and tried to hand it to me.   I told her no.  I wanted egg and cheese please, I don't eat meat.  She shrugged and attempted to hand it to me saying, so?  I said no. Please make a new one.  She yelled something to the cook and brought it right back laughing.  They only took the party off and squished the sand which together.  Really very poor service and concern.  I wasn't rude to the girl but she really should not work with people."}
{"text":"If I could give this a 0 I would.   First we had coupons from The Suns game for free biscuits so we decided we would try Carl's Jr. for the first time. Well turns out out coupons were only good for breakfast and since we were there in the evening they were good for nothing. Ok...change of game plane, we will order burgers. They look good on the commercials?!   We each got a Carl's natural burger and a strawberry shake to go. We got our food in a few minutes and took it home to enjoy. I took a bite and immediately tasted fish!! It was so disgusting that I had to spit it out immediately (and I am not a picky eater, nor was I expecting gourmet from Carla Jr). My boyfriend took a bite of his and while it didn't taste fishy he could only eat the meat and the cheese because the rest was soggy and gross. The shakes on the other hand weren't half bad.   My advice is to go to mcdonalds down the street. You'll spend less (ours was $18), and you'll get better food and service."}
{"text":"Decided to try their Moon shine burger. Not a normal thing for me as i rarely eat fast food (?). But time was running very late and my stomach was sending signals. Upgraded to the half pounder from third lb. Skipped the combo...just had sink water.  This was the very best hamburger I have ever had from any fast food chain.  Fast inside service as well."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this Carl's Jr. It's always friendly service and good food for fast food place in the area."}
{"text":"There's a worker named Veronica who is awesome! They are always over inundated with customers and she always goes above and beyond with her customer service... food takes time but she kills it with the professionalism and kindness! Fresh fries were yummy"}
{"text":"We ordered a plain cheese burger with fries and chicken tenders we had to go back for the fries because they charged us for them and forgot to give them to us PAY ATTENTION drive thru People you have one Job"}
{"text":"On Friday, I had a desire for a juicy hamburger, what happen Carl's are you more worried about how quickly you can throw me out the door.   In the past I have never had a bad burger from this Carls. normally they are made fresh to order, but you could tell the burger was not fresh this time it was dry and rubbery,   I did find out the lady manager that was there for many years was gone.    I will tell you Carl I would rather wait, for a fresh cook burger, rather then a steam table slap together one.   I will have to think twice on coming back again.   this experience puts you back with all the other burger chain resturants."}
{"text":"I couldn't take another bad visit here again and must write a review. This location is by far the worst in Phoenix. They have consistently messed up my order and it is unacceptable (no mayo, extra pickles, crisscut fries instead of regular, etc). How hard is it to follow simple instructions? There is always new faces so their turn over rate must be high due to poor management, leadership, and quality control. I implore that you do not waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Whenever my dad is in the state of Arizona, he loves to frequent Carl's Jr.  Grilled chicken sandwiches with either green chile or teriyaki sauce/pineapple.  He does not eat red meat.  We walked into this location in front of Walmart at Greenfield/McKellips and saw that there were turkey patty sandwiches.  They were delicious!  We ate a quick bite and watched the March Madness on the TV inside.  I got a teriyaki turkey sandwich and he ordered a guacamole turkey sandwich.  The guacamole was quite spicy, and there are even coupons in the mailers now for buy one get one free.  They are advertised as being under 500 calories each.  They give discounts to active and retired military as well as senior citizens and police/fire personnel.  Plus, we received a coupon for a free drink.  Excellent service too.  The staff were telling us there are hundreds of combinations not on the menu, and they were jovial."}
{"text":"It's fast food. It is what it is.   I just like their criss cut fries. I've tried one of their burgers- Teriyaki and while the flavor was okay, the meat was just not good.   The BF wanted to go again and got some criss cut fries and one of the fries was straight green and the BFs chicken sandwich was just terrible that he didnt eat it. I don't know about their standards. It's fast food and should be consistent but somehow this one has been crappy.   Right by the house and will not be back. Shouldn't be eating crap anyways so maybe a good thing it's so shitty."}
{"text":"Carl juniors Atlantic cod low-carb and tacos are fabulous.   Stop in if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Terrific service and their low-carb charbroiled  Atlantic cod is really to die for.  Also check out their low-carb chicken club, sure beats McDonalds."}
{"text":"Not really much to say about a fast food chain... you either like it or you don't.  Carls jr has always been on of my favorites. Lots of great flavor combos on their burgers and i love that they offer the low carb lettuce wrap for anything on the menu.  Fried zucchini is my favorite side option"}
{"text":"Last night was burger night. I get to the drive thru and order 2 (two) 5 dollar box meal deals with iced teas and one box is ordered plain for my wife. I drive up to pay, she says that'll be 5 and some change. I said that I ordered 2, she said ok left and came back and said we don't have any iced tea. So I said no drink. Now another lady Monica, comes out and rude as shit says, did you add that order on at the window. I filled her in. Monica orders me to pull around and park because they have the order behind me ready, like this is my fault and no tact whatsoever. Monica comes out to the lot with my missing meal. No ketchup no napkins no opology and says you want ketchup? Has to go back but sends someone else out instead of coming back out and taking care of the situation. I get home and the napkins, soaked in fry oil, are stuffed into the box on top of the fries that are dumped on top of the wrapped food. The burgers weren't plain and everything was cold at this point. I think we're done with this location."}
{"text":"I like carls in general, but this particular one was disappointing. It might be because I came here probably before closing (10:30pm) and it looks like they don't get much customers, but the sandwiches I ordered were dry and the bottom buns were slight burnt and very chewy, they must've been sitting there on the warmer for awhile. These were the 2 for $6 and I got 1 of each: 1.famous star 2.western bacon 3.bbqchix 4.turkey burger (the best of the 4). The actual best overall though we're the fried zucchini and the crisscut fries. It's really rare that I go to typical fast food chain joints, ever since I moved here to Vegas from the bay a year ago now and it's because there's so many new things to try out, but I'm a late nighter so by the time I get out alot of places are closing or closed. Hopefully carls can improve because I still need places like this."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero or negative stars. The drive thru is supposed to be open 24 hours as seen in picture but the employees say they can't serve anyone because they don't have a manager present      When told that we would wait they say you can't do that we won't be ready for at least an hour or two   The employees are just sitting taking inside and hanging out.    Horrible experience and I hope that the corporation looks into this."}
{"text":"Grandson loves the large burgers but I won,t go there unless we have a 2 for 1 coupon which they seem to publish often."}
{"text":"Waiting for ever at drive thru to order my food, the lady put me on hold before I even ordered my food. Worst part was I only ordered a spicy sandwich and fry and gave me a regular chicken sandwich... they weren't even busy to mess up a order!!! This location and employees need improvement!!!"}
{"text":"Someone must have read the other reviews because this place looks reasonably clean and the staff is very friendly.  If your ordering in they bring to the food to you.  Only if the best locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The staff is very friendly, especially the manager Edgar. Ideal place to hang out with friends. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes at the drive through window for an order consisting of 4 things. When I'm handed the bag I ask if that's everything because the bag looked awfully small. After being assured that it's everything I pull forward and decide to check for myself. Surprise, surprise half my stuff was missing."}
{"text":"Went to the Carl's Jr on Blue Diamond and Decatur on 7/14/16 and got the breakfast steak burrito combo.  I think it's over priced but thought if it were good it might be worth it.  Well I was wrong, it is over priced and it was not worth it.  Didn't care for it at all and very little steak (if that's what you can call it) didn't even eat half and tossed it."}
{"text":"Basically tastes like Burger King if it was Burger Emperor. The meat is cooked similar to BK but the buns and condiments make it so much better. And since this is a USA chain, the burgers are all huge and cheap. If you want a great fast cheap meal, come here.   Oh and get their app first and if you add your credit card to it, you get $10 free!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service. Long lines for cold burgers. They discourage large orders and they are completely rude. The customer service I received was far from decent. The guy was wearing a filthy Suns tee shirt. Poor dress code."}
{"text":"Rude drive thru staff. She handed me my order and dropped it and didn't even acknowledge it and just handed me my debit card back. Her body language was off and I didn't appreciate her overall demeanor. Here's a tip: If you're not a people person..don't work with the public."}
{"text":"This one was ooooooo k as far as Carl's Jr. goes. Staff was friendly and was greeted the second I walked in the door. Order was taken immediately, Food arrived promptly. I enjoyed my #6  Double Western Bacon Cheese Burger meal with Criss-Cut fries, and washed it all down with delicious Strawberry soda. I only give it 3 stars because its a little small inside, so its kinda cramped while eating."}
{"text":"I went to Carl's Jr for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised. I had been to one in California and didn't think it was that great. This experience was different.   The store is very clean, and the staff was very friendly. While I was there staff checked in on me, and even offered me a fresh biscuit for free. I had a five star burger-I think that's what it's called- whatever their cheeseburger is. It reminded me of a better version of a BK burger, plus it was huge. I had hot, crispy French fries and a chocolate shake. I would have liked the shake to have more chocolate flavour, but that is nit picky.   The only downfall is the price. Almost $13 for a fast food meal is steep, and I thought a&w ($9 for Papa burger combo) was overpriced!  I'm definitely going back..I was going to go today but looks like they aren't open Sunday's? Weird. Anyway, I'm surprised at the poor reviews! Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Fast Food? Don't count on getting it fast if the dining area has people. Then again, the dining area never has people."}
{"text":"This location is hit and miss, once in a great while the food will be ok at best.  Majority of the time it's better to go ANYWHERE else. Sad thing is I love Hardee's and Carl's jr"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my chicken sandwich was not crackin. Bread was hard & burnt, chicken was burnt and dry like jerky. Maybe the food is better when it's not New Year's Day. The fried zucchini were cool. Staff was nice but it would have been nice to also have a sandwich while the BF enjoyed his western bacon."}
{"text":"As far as fast food burgers go, I was impressed.  Yes there are better burgers in the city with all the gourmet places, but when compared to McDonalds and such, it holds its own.  I had the Big Carl (their version of a Big Mac)... I absolutely loved it! It was just like a Big Mac but huge!! And way better!!  The Big Carl is what a Big Mac should be!!  I highly recommend it!  The fries were typical but good.  I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience ever!! One person working the counter and window. One person cooking. This at 12:30 in the afternoon on Saturday. By the time I got my food and got it home it was cold."}
{"text":"So I March 21, 2018 we went and we drove through the drive-through at Carl's Jr. on Bonanza and Nellis Avenue we ordered the two fish fillet sandwiches french fries and my husband had a shake and I had a Coke he had a strawberry shake so we pull around the parking lot to eat her dinner cause we just left the doctor and we had errands to run yet well the fish wasn't clocked it was disgusting the french fries were burnt overcooked and dry it out and the only thing we managed to eat out of that was the Coke and the shake I want to bring it back in and give it to the girl in the store my husband said noI would not recommend this Carl's junior to anybody we have an eaten at one in a long time and we were so disappointed we went down the road to the Taco Bell about a block further down the road and bought burritos and tacos for dinner which tasted better than that crappy fish that was not cooked correctly my name is Joy JOY Johnson you can reach me at area code 702-453-4960 thank you."}
{"text":"April was very polite and pleasant. Of all of the bad customer service we receive everywhere she was a nice change. She had a smile and sweet voice. Good job April.  This is rare in this town. Always love the food here too."}
{"text":"Best breakfast food ever!! Great customer services. The food was excellent. Will definitely be back for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Ah, Carl's Junior!   That junction between the pricy restaurant burger and the zoo-meat grade McDouble.   They make a mean Jalapeno burger here, which I wholeheartedly recommend.  But skip the fries and the soda;  the fries, while thick and in great supply, are coated with enough salt to melt an iced road.   The soda I got was flat, too!  Drop the meal, take the Jalapeno burger."}
{"text":"Long wait. My chicken club sandwich tasted horrible. The chicken was very dry. I threw it away after eating half of it. Wrong dipping sauces were given to me. At one point the manager yelled into my car asking me \"what do you have?\" with a tone like I did something wrong. I went here because of convenience. Next time I will drive a little farther for better food quality and hopefully better customer service."}
{"text":"This was the strangest Carl's Jr. experience ever. I ordered my usual Western Bacon Cheeseburger, small combo. The guy at the counter was clearly new and needed help entering our order into the register, which I don't fault them for. That's totally fine. At least it got entered in right. They had to tender cash at a different register for some reason. We got our number, got some iced tea, and sat down at a table. An employee walks over to our table holding a bag and asked if we had the Western Bacon Cheeseburger... yes. She realized it was supposed to be dine-in and went back to put the food on a tray. When she brought it back, we noticed we were missing an order of fries and a chicken soft taco. She went back to get them. The fries that we did get were a medium instead of a small and they looked pale/undercooked. When my friend unwrapped his sandwich, he found it was a double cheeseburger instead of a chicken sandwich... He took it back up to the counter and they gave him the correct sandwich. Although he found it had ranch on it even though he asked for no mayo/sauce. Then when he went to unwrap the chicken soft taco, it was actually a bean burrito! He had to take that back too. They told us we could keep the burrito. My burger was fine, though I always wish they warmed the bun. The fries were lousy. I wanted to take them back and ask for fries that were hotter and cooked longer, but I didn't think they could handle it, given their track record for the evening. But by this point we were just laughing at how wrong everything had gone. During our meal, we could hear the shift manager, who was bagging orders, yelling at the staff. From our perspective, it looked like the shift manager was the one screwing everything up. We observed other people's orders getting messed up too. It was crazy! I don't think I've ever had a meal anywhere that was that screwed up. Get your act together, Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"This yelp let is not Vegan- yes I order the hormone free burger! The one on warm springs is my go to location, because the staff at this location is kind and patient.  I'm picky and customize my burger and the fried zucchini is my staple!"}
{"text":"They completely got our order wrong for our burger. Then while drinking my Oreo milkshake I find a piece of paper towel or some sort of tissue in my shake, Lord knows what could have been on it or what it was used for. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Horrible location. Love Carl's Jr and thought we would try it out here again because it's close to home. Terrible decision on my part. Service was slowest it's ever been. Rude employees again except for the girl on the register. It was her second day and she was trying so hard. Got our food and it was wrong. Went back up to have it remade and that was a challenge.   At the end of the day if Carl's Jr is what you looking for DO NOT come to this location. Take the time to go to a different one."}
{"text":"I quit eating fast food a long time ago.  However, I got summoned to pick up \"food\" from here after going to the gym nearby. I did not get myself anything, I'm thankful that I did not.  I was at the drive-through and after placing my order, I pulled up to get it from the guy at the window who was coughing without covering his mouth. Gross! If you're serving food and you're sick: wear a mask, cover your mouth when coughing then wash/sanitize your hands right after, cover your mouth when coughing using your upper arm/shoulder or don't come to work.  If that wasn't bad enough, my sister tells me they found hair in one of the burgers and a gnat flew from a piece of lettuce they were eating. Nasty!  Hopefully, after that incident, I won't have to make fast-food stops for other people ever again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before work. I only had fries. They were fresh and hot which is a good thing. Service was fast and efficient. I like how you can get your own ketchup considering how a lot of places give it to you or lack there of....I would return. The restaurant was clean too."}
{"text":"I am so upset. Tonight we go to Carl's Jr. On bell rd and cave creek and it's 11:30pm it's Friday which there sign says open til 1am and we go up to order nobody responds in drive thru. We pull up to the window and a girl worker is just inside walking around acting like she doesn't see us. Which she did and we beeped horn. Then I call while we're there and she doesn't even answer the phone! Totally unsatisfactory! Terrible employee and horrible customer service. So why she even there. Is she to busy standing that she can't make a burger. I'm calling corporate on this one! Tooo pissed off!"}
{"text":"Very rare to get your food delivered at a fast food place. Jodi checked on us, what a concept! Thank you for the exceptional service. :)"}
{"text":"Hit up Carl's for my first time the other day......this location is massive. Place was clean with plenty of seating. Had a couple questions about their burgers but the cashier was clueless. Anyways, I placed my order and took a seat as they deliver the food to your table. Within a couple of minutes my burger was ready. It was cold, the patty was dry and basically the exact same as Burger King but with a higher price point. I had their signature burger and it was identical to a Whopper. Won't be going back to this joint for their hideous burgers that's for sure."}
{"text":"We tried Carl's Jr. for the first time today.  This location was clean and the service was very good.  They gave us a number and delivered the food directly to our table.  They even checked on us after a few minutes.    I stuck with the chicken fingers and fries - I enjoyed the BBQ sauce but the fries were nothing special.  My husband said he really liked his burger (the famous star).    Overall I probably won't be craving this but it wasn't bad and I'd likely go back if my husband wanted it again."}
{"text":"Late night, drive thru. They got our order right 100% but the wait was not worth it. I'm not too sure if it was the employees fault or if the person if front just had a large order."}
{"text":"Very poor management here. The Mexican lady who is the manager seems to have a I don't give a crap attitude.  We ordered the Hawaian chicken sandwiches from her and the sandwiches were smashed together and the fries were ice cold. The manager has about as much personality as a wet noodle. Will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a jalapeño burger combo. The burger was a couple of shrunken patties, that looked like they had been sitting around. They were dried out and burnt. The fries and the so called burger were ice cold. I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Food is what you expect, service is ok. Downside is NIOT 1 table is clean and the staff has made no attempt to look at the lobby area."}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food- This place was A-OK for me and the BF for the start of our road trip. The line in the drive thru was pretty fast and the staff was friendly.  I always order the same thing- Santa Fe Chicken and the BF gets the $6 burger. Everything tasted fresh and the fries and zucchini were piping hit.  I would definitely return to this location if I am ever going on another road trip."}
{"text":"This location used to be an Arby's which was old and in need of a reno.  Carl's Jr. has revitalized this spot.  When we arrived for lunch there was quite the lineup.  The line moved fairly quickly and the person at the counter was very friendly.  She seemed to be in training but still handled the crowd well.  I tried the California Classic combo which was their special.  For $6 you get a burger (that was like a smaller Big Carl's), fries and a drink.  Not bad."}
{"text":"The drive thru waiting time can be too much at times. Food is fine, although they've messed up my orders and do not give the right amount of change back"}
{"text":"Basic fast food place.  The main reason I marked this place down is because of the lousy coffee provided here.  I came here for a quick breakfast and coffee should be a satisfying part of it.  McDonald's has superior coffee consistently."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day and starving.  Usually this makes everything taste much better than it should. When I asked what is their signature burger the manager on duty pointed out all their premium burgers at the 1/2 pound point.  I was put off with that as those are definitely what made this restaurant famous.  Then when I asked for a combo, they asked if I would like to make it into a poutine and shake.  I asked what is the price point and again the manager did not know the price premiums and just rang me up. The price went from 12.xx to 20.xx  There is no discount given to substitute the drink for a shake and fries to poutine. They just charge you a combo price then tack on a full priced shake and poutine price ontop.  Price being one thing. The quality of the burger was meh. Very very meh.  The fries were warm at best and when I complained back to the manager before walking off. I was treated like an idiot to say those are freshly fried.  I can only say good luck to this Yankee venture into Canadian waters. I can see this following in the footsteps of the bullseye that failed miserably in not understanding the Canadian market place. I will definitely not be back and do not recommend this. Save your money and walk over to A&W get satisfied with a better burger and better service and leave with a few more $$ in your pocket."}
{"text":"I hit the drive-through late at night and I have yet to have a good experience. After two seriously bad experiences, I'm boycotting this Carl's Jr.  I rolled up at approximately 3 AM two weeks ago and this overweight black dude was working the drive-through and cooking. He looked tired and I felt kind of bad for him. I got my usual, famous star with cheese, extra onions, extra tomato, extra lettuce. It didn't come as I ordered, I just chalked it up to the fact that maybe the guy was just overworked and underpaid.  So the following week I hit the drive through at approximately 1 AM and there was a Latino dude with a powder blue shirt, I'm assuming he was a manager or something? Anyway, I placed the exact same order and I noticed the black dude was in the back cooking. He didn't look too happy and I noticed him glaring at me. When I got my food home I noticed the order was fouled up again. Two little slivers of onion, a little bit of lettuce and a thin slice of tomato was all I got on my sandwich. The fact that it was cold really distressed me. That was the second time in two weeks that this Carl's Jr. employees screwed up my order.  I guess the kicker for me was looking through the drive-through window, seeing the cook adjust his pants and checking his cell phone after he gave me a strange look. It really grossed me out to be completely honest.  If anybody has hit the drive-through late at night and had the same experience, I'd like to read about it. I have a feeling I'm not the only one getting the orders screwed up and getting food that you have to reheat in the microwave.  -5 stars.                                             *UPDATE* So I decided to change it up a bit to see if the problem I was having was isolated to the night shift employees. I was very wrong, the hamburger was disgusting!  My buddy came in from out of town at approximately 4 AM and said he would like to eat at Carl's Jr. I explained to him that I've had some issues at this location. We rolled through the and I noticed the blonde hair white guy that was taking our order at the drive-through window on March 21, 2015 at approximately 4:30 AM sounded like he was on drugs, or possibly had a neurological problem. He was very cold and muttering. I didn't get a receipt and the food was room temperature again! This twentysomething year-old drive-through employee with severe acne was rude. It's unbelievable the way these night shift employees are so messed up.  My buddy was leaving yesterday, March 24, 2015 and he asked me if I could drive him to Carl's Jr. again. I figured the dayshift wouldn't get the order wrong, especially if we went into the restaurant to order the food, I was wrong yet again. The woman that helped us at the register was very nice, but as I said, the food was wretched. I posted photographs of my two famous stars with cheese, as well as the receipt.   This place is pathetic and sad. I could tell the people that work there are miserable and as you can see from the photographs, the food reflects their misery.  By the way, the chicken sandwich I ordered was for my better half, and that too was practically room temperature. She and I will never go back to this Carl's Jr. again."}
{"text":"Love this location I always use to come here bi weekly on Sundays and they got to know me and even offered me some coupons sometimes really friendly staff ."}
{"text":"The Carl's Jr.  on Queen St.  uses a different type of  meat that taste something like Mc Donalds.   If you want the original Carl's Jr.  go to the location on Yonge and St.  Clair.   Fair warning!"}
{"text":"I went to drive thru i couldn't hear so she asked me  to come to the window, i gave her my order, she looked like a gang member full of tattoos.  I told her no salt. She yelled at cook told her no salt. She hands me the bag says no salt. I get home there is salt on them they were cold too. Also the tomatoes werent even ripe yet im  posting my picture"}
{"text":"Don't go hear unless you have a death wish. I was given under cooked chicken. They took my order incorrectly so I had to add the sandwich the missed at the window. Was told it would take 5 minutes because they had to cook it. Which I was annoyed with but willing two wait. Instead of waiting for my chicken sandwich to cook for the 5 minutes they decided to give it to me in 2 minutes. I didn't think anything at the time I just figured they had already dropped chicken earlier. Nope not the case. I don't normally write reviews especially for fast food places but this is just a health hazard."}
{"text":"Geez!  What a downer!  Pulled out of the drive-through, got on the 17 and breakfast biscuits were hard and burnt AND gravy was liquid milk and cold!  Threw it all away."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the food seems old and dried out. Customer service is also a big problem! I went through the drive-thru and the guy barely said two words to me. Just took my money and threw my food at me."}
{"text":"This is their second location in Calgary. The staff here when I went through the drive-thru the other day were extremely friendly, especially for a fast food place. could be the excitement and newness of the restaurant so we'll see if that level of service remains after a few months.  As for the food...its good. Its your normal Carl's Jr. so you're getting a LOT of food for a good price. I tried the bacon poutine for the first time on this trip. Tons of bacon bits and its real bacon. No fakin' bacon."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch and had the $6 original burger.  The burger was pretty good especially considering it is a fast food joint.  That is all due to the charbroil vs. the microwave technique I think.  : ) Sorry McDonalds.  Anyways they have a good soda selection with Coke products so you get Fanta and Dr. Pepper.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 4 star is the french fries.  They were absolutely horrible.  I tried to eat them but just couldn't I ended up having 4 fries.  They were some of the worst I've had on my burger tour of AZ.  So if you go to Carls get the other options like criss cut fries or onion rings."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could. He service is the slowest ever. It is so slow, I had enough time to write a review on yelp. Fast food?? Get more workers at this location! i would not come to this location again."}
{"text":"Late after a night out, decided to get food from here. Had a coupon for a mile high bacon cheeseburger, which they don't have on their menu anymore, um, just got this coupon a week ago. They gave me the new menu item that replaced it, asked for extra crispy bacon. Got home and guess what, almost raw bacon, a burger on a pretzel bun, um, not what I wanted, you would think a change in bun would warrant telling me that. Also ordered onion rings, never again, all batter and undercooked, threw them away. Criss cut fries were subpar, but the chicken tenders my husband got were delicious. $20 to only eat $5 of the meal, I feel like Carl's Jr owes me money, you do realize you're competing with other fast food companies, oh maybe that's why you will never be on the top. Never eating here again and will share that decision with every one I know. Coupon or not, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"20 minutes sitting in the drive through good god. What IS going on? This is unacceptable. Get some help or something. Supposed to be fast food. Literally been here since 1:40p. It's now 2:03p and I'm late. Thanks Carl's Jr!"}
{"text":"This guy absolutely hates his job and probably his life. This is the second time I've came here to get something on the way home and it takes about 25 minutes he's angry rude and just disrespectful. You don't expect much from fast food but don't be an asshole when I ask for a cupholder because you handed me two bags of food and two drinks. How do you expect me to walk to my house carrying all that?"}
{"text":"TV ad made me stop in to check out the $5 All Star Meal - it was an okay deal but I wouldn't make it a regular and I'm sure won't be able to round long not a bad deal. I have been in here two or three times and this place is always clean. Lady behind the counter her name is Yardia is excellent attitude and customer service. For $5 you're going to get what you pay for. However, Carl's Jr. does make some fantastic Burgers at Fantastic Burger prices. Best I can remember here was the Carl's big $5 combo."}
{"text":"Met the owner of this chain in one of the other locations once. Nice guy and it shows in the restaurants. Staff is always more than friendly, quick personal service that you would hope to find in other \"sit down\" eateries. Expectations are always exceeded for me at this location and it is why I pass others to go to this spot.  The $5.00 Big Carl Combo is the best deal in town and the service is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru to get a bite to eat before going home. I just got off of work. Its 130am 2 o' clocktime. I went to this location after I finished my shift at work. From the time I placed my order to actually receving my food was over 10 minutes. I was one car away from the drive thru window. The attendee was talking to the person in front of me. There was no exchange of food for cash. It was a friend talking to a friend. This friend drove a Gold Buick. The attendee apologized for the long wait. Deejay had been chatting with her friend. I was so tired and long of a wait I forgot what I ordered. I had to drive back to pick up my receipt. I do not know if this was intentional or it was a mistake. It is suspect with the shoddy service the cashier would not give a receipt. I have been in Nevada for 4 months now and this is my 1st time at a Carl's. I have and do enjoy Carls in California. This was a first. I am very disappointed in the service and doubt I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Realistically, the only thing keeping the rating at 2 stars instead of just 1 was the closing of the experience.  The service was incredibly slow for being the lunch rush, especially since there were not more than 4 customers in the store.   As far as the menu goes, the choices are immense!  The coupons offered in this weeks paper were abundant and very well worth using.  The counter person was nice, used suggestive selling and had a smile.  The down side was the kitchen.  There were not that many people in the place and even if the Drive Through was packed, they can still only take one order at a time.  It seemed to be an unnecessarily long wait for a couple of burgers.   Again, save the day by the counter girl who apologized for the delay and then gave me a chocolate chip cookie as a consolation for waiting so long.   As far as the food goes, the burgers were both tasty.  The menu was so expansive it will take several visits to get through the bulk of it.  Not only your typical burger fare but salads and the connection of another fast food joint called the Green Burrito, they had a wide array of Mexican dishes as well.   A short review for me, I know.  Bottom line is this.  The kitchen service was terrible, the counter service was nice.  The burgers were OK, good enough to go back a 2nd time as maybe the experience was not the normal.  When it comes time to return, I will amend this review.  Until then, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The burger are big and the price are good.. not bad for a quick meal before your flight, but not the best."}
{"text":"I cringe to admit that I occasionally eat here, but I really am a huge fan of the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwiches.  That's all I get.  I can't review the rest of them, except maybe the BBQ chicken sandwich, because I haven't and never will try anything else there.  I also like the fries better than In and Out, yes I said it."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!! I went through the drive through and the girl was super rude. When I got to the window I looked over at the worker and she spilled ice on the counter and I saw her pick it up with her bare hand and throw it back in the ice chest. Ughh! When I told her she should have just thrown it in the trash and how unbelievably unsanitary that is, she said \" i just washed my hands\" I told her it didn't matter and that's awful especially since she was handling money especially she said \" if you want your food pay for it and leave otherwise you don't look like the police and I don't want to argue!\" I left with nothing because I was not about to eat or drink anything. DISGUSTING!!"}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. ruined my desire to ever go to one again. They didn't give us a receipt for our order which was weird. I ordered two western bacon cheeseburgers and they were burnt to a crisp and swimming in bbq sauce. Even worse, we noticed that our \"onion rings\" tasted weird and pulled out a ripped up piece of chicken. What if the customer had a poultry allergy? Yikes."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this restaurant. I was greeted with a smile before I even walked in. I normally don't eat in but I did today & I was treated like a queen. My food was brought to me & the guy even introduced himself. I was checked on & they even whisked my tray away when I was done.  The manager Norma was just a ray of light & you can tell she brought up the spirit of all her employees. Also the food was good. I always order the same thing so I can tell when something is off. Good food, stellar service, cool building design & overall just super impressive."}
{"text":"I drive by this location all the time but rarely busy.  This morning I want breakfast and finally skate outta the house about 1030, Golden Arches line through parking lot, and Jack had a line to smiths..one last attempt pull up and the car in front of me was also trying to order breakfast. Perhaps it's time for a little wiggle room for breakfast on weekends or time for Hardee's to evaluate that most places do some breakfast all day.  I ended up with a triple bacon (bacon= breakfast?!?! Ah who cares BACON!!) burger, I was not a big fan. The bacon relish to sweet for my liking.   I guess next time I'll just wait in line elsewhere if I want breakfast!"}
{"text":"Drive thru experience is never good here. Every single time I go drive thru, they are either rude or they don't get my order correctly.  Last night, me and my boyfriend and his brother went drive thru and we get home to find out they missed out a part of our order, my boyfriend had to drive back just to get it and the guy knew what he was there for. My boyfriend wanted something for the mix up and all we could get was a cookie. We drove all the way back for the rest of our order and they can't at least be nice and have given us something better for messing up.   Also, I remember a while back I had an experience in drive thru with a lady, and she got the whole order wrong. I wanted to get to know her name and she didn't bother telling me. My boyfriend had to go inside to fix the order and she was arguing with him and calling him a liar.  Keep in mind, this was the manager! She said she didn't care because it was her last day. Also, another customer had the same problem with her so she sided with my boyfriend. Good thing she's no longer working there!   My experience when dining inside is somewhat better. I just wish they could be like that in drive thru!!   Last night made me and my boyfriend realized we aren't coming back, at least not to this location.  Sorry! Tired of getting a mix up or the wrong order."}
{"text":"Decent food, but a little pricey. It's a good place to go if you are really hungry and willing to shell out the cash. A number of times I noticed homeless people hanging around and the occasional drunk passed out in one of the corner booths. The staff really needs to be more aware and concerned about that. it's not good for a business to have drunken derelicts hanging out and bumming money, cigarettes, etc. from customers.  But at least the orders are correct and the quality seems up to par. Not bad for a fast food place."}
{"text":"The absolute nicest drive through girl I have EVER talked to in my life!!!! She needs to give classes on how to take an order!! Good hire!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't open 24hours??? And it's 9:51 and it isn't open.. by far the worst Carl's Jr. ever!! I will never come on the count of the lazy employees"}
{"text":"Mmmm Carl's Jr.  I don't know what the guy who hated the fries is talking about.  I like the fries here.  The burgers are awesome though.  This place is a bit underrated I think. It's comprable to Smashburger and cheaper."}
{"text":"I usually like Carl's. the people are nice, the food is good, and the service is great! However, when I was there tonight the guy helping us was a complete jerk. He charged us for something and then argued that's not what we ordered, even though it was on the receipt. On top of that, he asked if we wanted sauce and then got annoyed when we said yes. Then he crammed three burgers and 3 fries into the same bag. Which sent fries all over the place and smashed the burgers. Needless to say my friends (who I was introducing to Carl's) were thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was going very well. The place was clean, the food was decent, the wait was minimal and the employees were friendly.  As we are sitting here finishing Up our meal the young man working the counter came out to clean up.  He wiped the tables off, wiped the garbage off and used the same cloth to wipe the trays they serve the food on off.   I'm so disgusted. What In the world kind of practice is this?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past, had no problems.  The lady that was doing the drive through window was the least helpful person ever. Very demeaning. They don't have a posted dollar menu/value menu. So I asked wrong apparently, asking about a dollar menu, with a sharp, \"we don't have a dollar menu!\"  Followed with silence... \" okay.. do you have a value menu at least,\"  \"well we have this this and this.\" \"Okay. Well let me get those then.\"  Thank goodness burger king is right up the street. I will be going there for my local burgers from this time on."}
{"text":"My rating is only because the last 2 times that I was at your location have not been the greatest, nothing related with the food because the food is always great but more likely with the employees. The 1st time was because I told the girl on drive thru that wanted Dr. Peppers with my meals and I had repeat myself twice and she still got it wrong I didn't think to check but got home and they were both Cokes ! Which we just got over it and still drank the soda. Obviously no need to call or complain about it , and so tonight I went again and ordered my food and when I got to the window handed her my card and she was passing my drinks to me I asked to make sure they were Dr. Peppers (Not in a rude way) and said because the last time I was here they gave me cokes instead and the girl said \"oh they are Dr. Peppers\" is a really smart smirky attitude and so I told her I just wanted to make sure because of last time and it just felt like she was not being friendly . I worked for fast food for so many years and I understand completely how frustrating it can be to work late night shifts and long hours and deal with crazy people late at night , it's not the best and not so fun but it's a paying job and working customer service for a while I dislike being treated a certain way if I'm being nice about everything and not being mean or attitude with employees because I was once myself. Then after I felt like she just wanted to be rude and she handed me my food and smiled with total attitude and so that made me really upset and decided to check my food and even my boyfriend didn't like the way she looked at me when she handed us our food so I asked for her name because she wasn't even wearing her name tag and she replied with \"its Lexis and it's on the receipt and don't understand what I did wrong \" and slammed the window shut ! Very disappointed with their customer service...."}
{"text":"While I love Carl's Jr. this was the first and last time this location will be getting our business. When we pulled up to the ordering menu the lady said ''I'll be with you in a minute'' 5 minutes later she takes our order, and we pull thru to the pick up window-she gladly took our payment but we waited 10 minutes to get our food, we pulled up a few inches to see what was taking so long, and everyone was just standing around...finally we get our food, and the woman didn't offer a ''sorry about the wait...'' nothing...just a ''here ya go'' and basically shoved the bag at my husband. Get the food home, and it's semi warm, my double burger patties weren't nearly as big as they should of been, they only put about 5 jalapenos on it, and my husband found a HAIR in his drink. This place needs better management or just needs to close permanently, because that was by far the WORST customer service I've ever had!"}
{"text":"It's a typical fast food place, with employees that are too busy talking amongst themselves to offer really good service.  They have not gotten our orders wrong yet, so there is a good thing."}
{"text":"Hitting up Carl's Jr for a quick bite before it got too late, the wife and I were made to wait at the counter for a couple minutes before we were helped. This is because they had one employee in the kitchen and one working both the front counter and drive through. He missed seeing us come in as he was busy helping the drive through customers. Not his fault the managers don't staff the restaurant properly.  Finally, the kitchen worker lady let the cashier guy know we were waiting. He took our order promptly and efficiently. We went to the drink machine to get our thirsts quenched and hit another snag. Their machine was diluting everything. The mix was off by quite a bit. All of the sodas we tried were way lighter in color and tasted more like lightly flavored soda water than soda. We tried the: DrPepper, Coke, Sprite, Root Beer & Raspberry Iced Tea. Letting the guy know the machine seemed off, he said he would look into it. He messed with some of the syrup in the back, then sampled the sodas out front and let us know it should be fixed. It isn't his fault that they don't train him on re-calibrating the soda machine, as the drinks still tasted weak and funny after his attempts to fix the issue.  Shortly thereafter, he brought out our food and checked on us a couple times throughout to make sure we had everything we needed. That's one touch I really like about Carl's Jr!  My Super Star with cheese was delicious, it didn't fall apart like some of them do. The bun was not stale or weak either. The fries are some of the best frozen, fast food fries I have had in a while."}
{"text":"Great location on a major street with a drive thru window. Lady at the drive thru had great customer service and the food was hot and good. They had a great meal deal for $5 that hit the spot when I was in a rush and starving. Double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, coke and a cookie for dessert. Will definitely come again if im in the area and need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Stopped here for the first time tonight since I had a coupon, free fries and drink with purchase of 5-piece chicken breast. I walk in, place my order and hand the cashier my coupon. He stumbles around and after a minute or two tells me he's not sure how to apply the coupon -- no problem, he must be new. A couple more minutes pass and I see the total as $9.87. I think to myself I sure hope a supervisor is available. Looking around the poor boy was left by himself.  Eventually a supervisor comes, relief!! Well, not exactly. The supervisor also stumbles around trying to apply the coupon with no luck. Have these guys never seen a coupon?? Eventually the coupon works (I think) and I was charged $6.48. Not a huge savings compared to BOGO coupons. Oh well.  I sit down to eat my meal and find myself to be the only person dining in (at 7pm). I kept questioning if they were closing soon because of how quiet and eerie it was. On the positive the chicken was yum, yum tasty! Very juicy and filling, but based on the lack of coupon knowledge I probably won't be back to Carl's Jr.  Yeahhh, I'm a thrifty girl when it comes to fast food. Last score being two Big Macs and medium fries at McDonalds for $4.10! Carl's Jr. needs to step up their game if they want my business."}
{"text":"We walked in and waited for 5 minutes or so, even though there was nobody in line in front of us. We then waited a good ten minutes before our order was brought to us, where all the food seemed reheated rather than cooked fresh. The chicken strips were rubbery and the cheese fries were pretty disappointing and soggy. The cheese wasn't even fully melted. The cook here was very vulgar (Tip: remember that even if someone looks white, they might know Spanish...) and it was just uncomfortable to hear someone complain so much about their job and their managers."}
{"text":"I have always had great service at this Carl's Jr.  The burgers are incredible and I'm surprised they haven't surpassed the competition in this area. They are always coming up with new ideas...some are so-so, but others rock, like the Diablo burger (my favorite). I never walk away hungry or unsatisfied.  Keep up the good work, CJ!"}
{"text":"Car'ls Jr has the best burger commercials! They have been playing one with the 'California Classic Burger' and its been driving me crazy..so on my way home today I thought I would stop by and try it out. Boy, am I glad I did. Its not a very big burger, but its perfect for my appetite. It was so juicy and delicious. I believe its the 'special' sauce that makes it so good.  So, yea..I would get one while they are here! I believe the burger is a limited time frame? Damn its juicy!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is always so friendly. I feel like I am getting really good sit down restaurant type of  service but at a fast food place. Whoever is doing the hiring here is hiring great people."}
{"text":"This place its ok but it has the worst customer service at night, the guy that assist me he sounded like if he hated his life or his job And its sad but food its ok"}
{"text":"Very expensive place with rather small portions. The side salad I ordered was extremely disappointing, only had one slice of cucumber and one slice of tomatoe with a whole bunch of lettuce thrown in. Worst salad ever."}
{"text":"Well, I'm a person who don't like to say anything negative when it comes to food but today was my last straw. I constantly get something wrong with my order and today I literally found a hair in my burger!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, and everytime I go in, I swear I will never return!  The location is great....  Food takes forever!  Waited 14 minutes for a biscuit sandwhich.  Service was horrible."}
{"text":"Overall, the cashier was not in the mood to work. She kept messing up on our order intake. Once we ordered the meal came in quick but again kitchen staff messed up on my boyfriend's order & refused to give us ranch because \"they needed to charge for the sauces.\" For the next trip to the Las Vegas Airport they need to add more food variety in each terminal."}
{"text":"Every single time I go they mix up my order even when it was just me in line. They take way too long in the evenings"}
{"text":"Where have I been?  When did Carl's Jr go upscale?  Maybe I should have seen it with their $6000 combo (The commercial that says it's served only at the Palms - and staring the Maloof Brothers?) or maybe their $6.00 burger.    In running some errands it was suggested that we eat here.  Not grab here or drive through here, but eat here.  I think I'd eaten inside a Carl's Jr maybe once before in my life.    It's actually decent inside here.  There were 3 different TV's around the place, at the time all tuned on a different one of the ESPN channels.  I got this big Chicken salad for $6 and was shocked when it came out quite big.  And actually good.  And I was washing it down with a Squirt.  As I'm eating my salad, a girl there came over to see if I'd like a refill.  Are you serious?  I said no, but my companion said yes.  We had our drinks filled another time after that.  At the end, I wasn't sure if we were supposed to tip or not.  We left a buck just in case though we didn't see anyone else doing the same.    I didn't check out their nutritional info to know if it was actually healthy or if it just felt healthy - but it sure was a nice option to have vs. another burger or taco place."}
{"text":"Only one car in front of me. All I ordered was a small fry and large drink. Sat in line for over 5 minutes - finally I just backed out and left. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I pull in off the 215 on Eastern, and locate this restaurant, but the drive thru has three or four cars stacked up, so I walk inside. I'm the second customer waiting to order. The counterperson looks up and greets me warmly. The person in front of me starts to order, then the manager also looks up from behind the counter and greets me, and I'm thinking \"Really, really friendly!\". Another minute or two while the person in front of me changes their mind about their order, and then....  The hispanic woman stationed at the drive-thru window turns around with a scowl on her face, stalks over to the partition between the cashier and the cooks where the burgers come out, leans over toward the cooks, and says in a voice loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear (and I quote) \"MUCHO BLAH BLAH BLAH!!\"  I smiled so big when she turned around to go back to the drive-thru she winked at me.  Now that's what I call a sign of the times. :) Absolutely hilarious.  For the record, I was in and out of this Carl's Jr. in less than ten minutes, start to finish, but the cars in the drive thru were still stacked three and four deep.    I vote this restaurant \"Best In Chain\" for Carl's Jr. of all the Carl's Jr.'s I've been to in Las Vegas.  \"MUCHO BLAH BLAH BLAH!\" to all Carl's Jr. cooks everywhere! \"MUCHO BLAH BLAH BLAH!\"  LOLOLOL!"}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  As soon as I was promoted to order over the speaker in the drive thru, the male worker was exceptionally rude and you could tell was distracted. He was unaware that I could hear him laughing and talking to others in the background and continue to mess up my order. Then I waited in the drive thru with a car in front of me for 10-12 minutes. It was ridiculous. Then as I got to the window, their attitudes were unprofessional and rude and I still sat there waiting for at least another 5 minutes. What were they doing in the meantime? So much for \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"I show up with some coupons thinking it would be simple. They didn't mess up just once but twice with inputting the coupons. We asked for a breakfast sandwich and they say they're out of eggs. Likely story. We ordered two superstars one with NO CHEESE, because I'm allergic, but of course they both have cheese. So now I can't eat and they just closed. You guys fail!"}
{"text":"The ladies here always remember that I want ketchup and Barbecue on the side.   I don't even have to ask them anymore, I love Carl's so yeah."}
{"text":"11/17/16, 6.18 pm drive through  just for a kids meal with raspberry ice tea. Seemed the staff new due to the items and price displayed kept changing. Showed on screen 2 drinks charged and I asked but no answer. Its okey I thought being over charged for 99 cents only, besides I was in rush. Passed to pay, the staff ( I assumed her name is Tiara) with no hello, no thank you and no smile but sour disgust face passed the order even without eye contact since she was busy chatting about her schedule with other staff. My child sip the drink and found out wasn't ice tea but fruit punch. Went around to drive through again, without apology the same staff just grab the drink from my hand. And asked another staff to passed my right drink. The same attitude I got from the this blue hair staff, she passed the drink and slam the window in front of me. I got no straw and had to kept calling hello and beg for it. Found out was ice tea plain and no sugar offered. How \"amazed\" with kind of attitude of Carl Jr two staff who don't know how to say hi, thank you, apology even a smile, I can say your staff are rude. So curious how did you get and recruit them? Anyway, none of my business besides promise myself never come back and warns others. Simply so disappointed."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service and understaffing here.  Always have hiring signs inside.  Food is not always accurate or hot when served.  Shortage of competition in the area, so they stay in business."}
{"text":"Worst service. Waited about 5 min in drive thru to get a grilled chicken club and when I got my order I got a chicken breast that was only about half a chicken breast! Definitely not coming back!!"}
{"text":"So this used to be a really good location. It has (within the last year and a half or so) taken a really bad turn. Not only has the quality of the food gone down, but so has the customer service. The young man taking our order was very slow and very  disorganized. After making my mother wait a long time for her food, he also asked her if he could put her food in a bag instead of a box (we ordered $5 All Star Meals). My mother asked why and his response was \"Honestly, I just don't want to open the boxes.\" My mother said she preferred the boxes and it took zero extra time to pack the food in the boxes. When we received our orders, the food tasted old, they were lazily packed, and some of the orders were incomplete. The fries in particular had a dirty taste to them. If you are really in the mood for Carl's Jr, I'd skip this location."}
{"text":"It's what to expect with other Carl's Jr. And it is the same no better or worse.   The highlights is Gabriela,  the manager is good.  This place is at Sunset and SandHill."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such a low rating, I think it's really good!   I've come here a few times throughout the summer as I worked nearby. Yes it's just a fast food place but I thought it was pretty great, especially coming from the states and all.  All I've ordered there is their regular burger and fries, nothing fancy but did the trick! I love a good burger. I also recently tried their lattice fries poutine just because. It was good but kind of really soggy. My friend dumped her fries into my leftover cheese and gravy when I was done and there was enough for her to have a poutine too lol!  Definitely a good go to for yummy, cheap ish comfort food!"}
{"text":"Found a giant clump of hair in my burger! I am so disgusted. Save yourself a trip and don't eat here."}
{"text":"mediocre food. dirty restaurant. employees behind the counter need some basic customer service training and learn to smile and be pleasant. great location on Gilbert Rd."}
{"text":"I am not above fast food occasionally. Some chains rise above that maligned title and have some very tasty items. The barbeque bacon burger I had at this location yesterday did not rise above. It was dry and lacking sufficient BBQ sauce to make up for it. When I went up to the counter again, they were nice enough to give me a packet to add to the burger, but it was still lacking a great burger favor. The restaurant was nearly empty, so I suspect the meat patty had been sitting in the warming bin for way too long.   This restaurant had been here for decades, but the place is clean and the booths show no sign of wear.   Maybe next time I have a coupon and the restaurant is slow, I will ask for a fresh off the grill burger patty. I will let you know how it goes."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write a review for a fast food restaurant for 2 reasons.... 1. Most are all the same and 2. I don't want my friends to see my weakness in eating un healthy.  I recently visited Carl's Jr. On Durango after visiting a client across the street. There is a server named Penelope who I saw go up to each and every person sitting down and asked if everything was all right and if they needed anything.   Other places should take notice. A simple how are you doing goes a long way and made my day!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars: Went maybe a month ago and it was amazing I went to the location at 32ave n.e. its not as busy as it is in 16th ave n.w.  4 stars because they are clean, fast and efficient The food is uber good. The burger is huge....I have to eat it in 2 seatings... I couldn't finish it since its that big. Flavor is awesome too..."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Carl's, love their BBQ Chicken sandwich. So stopped in with my son on a late Sunday afternoon. Girl taking our order in the drive thru was very matter of fact. Ordered the #1 Big Star combo, a chicken sandwich and one order of fried zucchini. Waited about 8 minutes with the girl at the window never smiling, just took our money.  We don't live far took our order home. Chicken sand was good but had way too much BBQ sauce. The Big Star also had way too much mayo and ketchup and my sons bun became a soggy, gooey mess. Fries with the combo fresh and hot but they had some sort of burnt batter type of crumbs mixed in. Zucchini was fried fresh and hot but the order came with 5 pieces. Definitely not worth the price tag.  Not sure if I can justify the cost of their food for another visit."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't review a fast food chain but the service today warranted it. I went in the girl behind the counter asked what I wanted. Told her I'll need a minute. She told me to take my time. Checked back in with me a minute later. Said I was torn between two items. She asked which ones. Clarified what I wanted and made a suggestion. Went with the natural burger as she suggested. She then Offered me a cup for water while I waited. The burger was really good!  Her service was awesome! Didn't get a  receipt with a survey so had to praise her here. Not often do you get even decent service at fast food- maybe it's changed and I didn't notice since its rare I eat it, but it was refreshing to have great service   Service was still awesome but it's still a fast food place and the hubs says it's not deserving of a five rating"}
{"text":"The food was okay (the patty tasted okay but was dry as hell), but the staff experience was abysmal. The guy at the register spoke barely above a whisper and I couldn't hear a thing he was saying, nor did he seem to be able to understand me when I was asking how much certain things cost and he kept entering the wrong items into the register. He may have been a trainee, which is tolerable and understandable, yet I still couldn't hear anything he was saying.  Still, I was polite and courteous.  The ice king of a supervisor(?) stepped in to take my order in frustration, entered the wrong things (left over from the previous guy?), and I asked why a plain kid's burger and a plain cheeseburger and a side of bacon were $17.60, thinking something was ordered wrong or that combos were entered by mistake. He walked away and said that it had already been ordered if wanted to know the prices I could check the receipt on my own. Wow.  For the record, I did check the receipt once I got to the table and, yes, both items were entered incorrectly--similar to what I ordered, but more expensive versions (i.e. a child's plain burger with a side of bacon was entered as a more expensive Western Bacon burger; a plain cheeseburger was entered as a more expensive 1/2 lb Original).  I just didn't have the energy to deal with resolving this or turning this into a thing right there. I just wanted to eat and go home.  There was also a large pile of swept-up garbage sitting in the middle of the floor, unattended to, which was unappealing to have to eat next to since half the seating area was blocked off with paper signs and chairs and there was nowhere to eat except next to the garbage pile.  Never having been to a Carl's Jr., I was curious to try it but now I'm mostly irritated at myself for not walking out when I first started ordering. The experience in this location was a huge turn-off that tainted any enjoyment I had from the (expensive) food."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had with the company. They were out of food items and condiments. My food was cold. Employees were not very nice."}
{"text":"They always offer fast and great service...no complaints, they always make my chicken stars fresh (as fresh as fast food can be) Thier burgers are good, my daughter loves Thier cheeseburgers and my fiance loves the western bacon cheese Burger. Fries are sometimes 2 greasy but that's expected in fast food."}
