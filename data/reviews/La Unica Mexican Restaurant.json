{"text":"We were so looking forward to finding a new restaurant in this area, but sadly we won't be coming back.   The margaritas, like the service, are subpar. Like my date said: this is a Mexican food Denny's.  Save your mula and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The new location is a huge improvement, able to accommodate the big crowds.  La Unica does not allow its apparent authenticity to interfere with rendering the favorites that the Americano audience in Huntersville expect the way we expect them.  I am not buying into the best in Charlotte\" claims, but they do what they do quite well."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch at La Unica on Friday with 2 friends around noon - this is one of our go-to lunch spots in Huntersville. Even in the height of the lunch rush we were seated immediately in a cozy booth in the back. Free salsa (mild and hot) and chips quickly followed. We ordered a small queso to share (~$4) and it was delicious as always! I would drink it with a straw if it was socially acceptable.   I almost always order the lunch chicken fajitas (~$8). A generous portion of chicken, peppers, and onions are served with refried beans, rice, and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. Overall the food is good, not great, and priced fairly at lunch. You could easily get lunch for less than $6 and not feel hungry the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I went back twice and unfortunately the food was not as good as my first experience. The chicken on the tacos was barely warm and the quality was not as high. The service was awful. I was there in the middle of the afternoon and it felt like the staff was worn out from lunch crowds. Overall it was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Wow, from all the great reviews we figured we would check this place out.  I found the food bland and the service while nice to me, not very good.  The waitress made the fatal mistake of being dismissive to my wife.      My wife did enjoy her food and maybe im getting sick and my tastebuds are off.  We will have to give this place another shot on all the good reviews alone.   Remaining hopefull,"}
{"text":"We eat here every Sunday. It's our favorite Mexican restaurant.  We've been going to La Unica since it was over in the Food Lion shopping center. They have friendly service and excellent traditional Mexican food.  Just be prepared to wait for seating. They are so popular now, that there is normally a short wait."}
{"text":"Good Mexican at a good price nothing fancy and they will make what you want  I ordered pork and it was great"}
{"text":"This is the best mexican at the lake! I would give it 10 stars if I could. Been going here for ages, even before they moved locations and the servers are great, Jumbo margarita is the BOMB, and you have to get here early before lunch and dinner rush because word has gotten around town and it gets super busy because this place is so good and popular. Get the green salsa if you are looking for super spicy. I think the only reason some people left less than 5 stars is because the place was slammed busy!"}
{"text":"I would say it average. I would only come back for the chicken tortilla soup. We came on a Saturday and it was busy so service was very slow."}
{"text":"We always loved their food at the strip mall location, but we hadn't eaten here in a while because we moved to SC.  Stopped and ate at their new location this evening.  Beautiful new place in what was Cheeseburger In Paradise.  Food was amazing.  Service is good, presentation and variety is great.  If you like seafood and spicy, you must try the No Name Dinner, it's delicious!  I guess we'll be driving the 45 minutes to come visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Very quick service. You know it's good when it's crowded on a Wednesday night! Reasonable prices and great food."}
{"text":"Terrible Mexican food. I had a taco salad which consisted of a small portion of shredded iceberg lettuce, a scoop of ground beef mush, 2 slices of roma tomatoes, some shredded cheese, a huge portion of sour cream all in a taco shell. Very bland. Chips and salsa were served quickly but the salsa was so-so. Service was good, that is the only reason I give it 2 stars. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"La Unica is consistently a great dining experience! Even during the busiest times, we always get seated quickly and have prompt service. The food is always served fast. We have several favorites. The fajitas are great. We also love the Pollo crema! The kids love the grilled steak on the kids menu as well as the chips and queso. Dont forget to ask for the complimentary Verde salsa (it isn't given at seating with the other two delicious salsas)."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican style restaurant around Huntersville.  Very reasonable priced and good fresh food.  I just recently went there for Sunday brunch and got the Heavos Rancheros.  Very good."}
{"text":"I lived in Charlotte for a few years and I was very happy to have found a place with great authentic Mexican food. I have always had great service from the wait staff. Not to mention, that Willie, the manager always tries to go around and ask how's everything going and makes sure they take great care of you. If you are in for great authentic Mexican food and want to be adventurous I could give you a few suggestions of some of my favorite items on the menu:  Torta de Milanesa de Pollo (breaded chicken breast Mexican sandwich) Ceviche!!! ( I could eat this every day- try it with some of the green salsa)  Any tacos with their fresh daily made salsas  Tip: You know it's an authentic place when they also have the green avocado salsa on your table, and if it's not there you can also request it!  Can't wait to visit Charlotte so I can stop by!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Have never had a bad meal. The Margaritas are always good. The food is will prayed and always fast. The service is efficient if sometimes not the friendliest. My favorite is the No Name Dinner. Wife enjoys the Speedy Gonzalez lunch special. You cannot go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is always so good. The ONLY thing I really don't like is that they serve shrimp that is NOT deveined! It's yucky and gritty and I wish they'd clean the shrimp! Other than that, good food and good service! If you like REALLY spicy salsa, ask them for the green salsa (they don't bring it out, you have to request it). It's made of jalapenos, avocado, and I think tomatillos. It's really spicy and so delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently above that found any where else in the Charlotte area. Service is quick and efficient. The food is prepared fresh, as best I can tell, but reaches your table quickly."}
{"text":"I am so glad that they moved to this new location! We had the lunch fajitas and they were so delicious and flavorful! Great fresh chips with two salsas, generous portions, and attentive service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Unica remains the best Mexican spot in the greater LKN area. I love the Flautas and the wife loves the chicken fundidos, but we sometime share the chicken frajita platter. The big basket of chips (with 2 types of salsa) is always fresh and warm. Add some queso and a pitcher of margaritas and you are in heaven."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. The waitresses are always very helpful and friendly, the chips are free, and the food is quite good. I won't get too carried away, it is not the most authentic tasting from a cultural perspective; however, the chefs still create great tasting entrees. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality meal."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several times over the years. It's ok, I've mainly gone to meet friends as I prefer authentic Mexican cuisine over the \"Americanized\" Mexican cuisine that is served at La Unica.  I ordered the Pollo a La Crema, the chicken was tough, extremely tough and the sauce did not have poblano peppers, as its always had when I've ordered it in the past.  What changed with this dish? What changed with this restaurant?  Also, the premium margarita I ordered was weak and not mixed well.  I don't know what's happened with this restaurant but I will not go back.  Again, I was only there because a family member wanted to go.  I'm D-O-N-E... there's a far better authentic Mexican restaurant in Huntersville about a mile from this place."}
{"text":"Stop by for lunch with my husband. Typical cheap Mexican food. Food was good and the place looked very clean. Green guacamole salsa is great if you like very spicy salsa."}
{"text":"Very quick service and great Mexican food! I do eat here regularly. It's hard for a restaurant to provide the same service every time but they find a way too!"}
{"text":"Love this place !! Have never had a less than delicious meal here! The Arroz Con Pollo is my favorite by far, I absolutely love everything I've gotten here, though! The queso is a must!"}
{"text":"While most east coast people don't know what to look for in good Mexican food I assure you coming from California this place has it. Good food at a great price with fast service."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in NC.  The place is always busy but they move folks through very quickly without seeming to rush the customers.  Have not tried everything on the menu but every item i tried was great.  Especially like the Authentic Tacos....Salsa and quacamole is also very good.  Prices are great as well...highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"La Unica which means the \"only one and only\", ummm I dont think so! This is your typical Mexican restaurant with horrible customer service and ok food. The prices are good for what you get. So if you want to get your typical Mexican restaurant experience and add bad customer service then you can go to La Unica."}
{"text":"Everything from this restaurant clearly comes from a can. I didn't even recognize the chile relleno when my meal arrived, it was basically a scrambled egg patty with processed cheese and a slice of canned green chile. The acoustics in the restaurant are so bad that you can't hear each other over all the noise, I definitely wouldn't come back. A lot of the food is dry and bland plus they skimp on the sauce for your enchiladas. I've had phenomenal chile relleno at little hole in the wall placed  so I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Place is always great for lunch ...clean , staff is quick and attentive , food is great . Had the chicken soup lunch special with chunks of all white roasted chicken along side tortilla strips , chunks of avocado and assorted vegetables ...came with a side of quesadillas for $7.99 ...definitely one of the better Mexican choices in the area !"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat.  Authentic tacos de carnitas are amazing.  I also recommend the No Name and the chilaquilles.     Service has slowed a bit with the new location but still 5 stars for the price"}
{"text":"Went to La Única for the first time last night and I was so happy we decided to try it. It was packed but we were still seated within ten mins. Service was fantastic. Chips and salsa brought to our table as we sat down and our order was taken almost immediately. The food was absolutely delicious! We had the combo enchilada, chalupa and taco plate. Everything was really fresh and it was light- we didn't have that heavy, greasy feeling in our stomach after we ate. I also loved that the chicken was shredded and not cubed. We also had fried ice cream which I will definitely recommend as well. Without a doubt will be going back!"}
{"text":"It's just okay Mexican food. Not bad, but also not that great at the same time. I left feeling underwhelmed.   From reading the previous reviews, I decided on the tacos as they looked to be a popular item. I tried to hit a variety by choosing as diverse of tacos as I could. I got Mexican sausage, chicken, beef and pork. They came topped with cilantro. They weren't very big at all, but they were only $1.89. You can request a hard taco and it is the same price. The only problem is, naturally I would prefer cheese on my tacos, but it is an extra 40 cents per taco. Clearly that's not a big deal, but I think these tacos should just come with it. The tacos were just mediocre.   I ordered a side of guacamole that was very small which was fine as I was just going to top my tacos with it, but I thought the price would reflect this accordingly. Instead, a small side of guacamole was four dollars. This guacamole wasn't anything special tasting, nor was there much of it. Definitely do not get the guacamole when you come here.   Their margaritas taste very good and are very large. Definitely get one when you go. Overall, it's a pretty decent Mexican place, nothing special. Just pretty traditional food."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican I've found in the Charlotte area! The bartenders are great and knew us after just a few visits. The salsa is fantastic (although the hot is pretty hot). The prices are reasonable. We always get the same few things: chicken tacos, chimichanga, cheese enchilada, Cali burrito, El Paso, or Yolandas. Nothing has ever disappointed! They also do super fast to go (and have 2 parking spaces dedicated to take out order patrons which is nice since parking on a Friday or Saturday night is sometimes an issue)."}
{"text":"Always friendly service, great food selection and tastes! Well priced margarita pitchers and plenty of room for groups."}
{"text":"My fiance and I wanted to try this place out and did not have a good experience at all.  First, when we came in to get a table, we had to wait and were handed a vibrating disc like most other popular places.  We were not told they didn't work and they would be shouting out the numbers they neglected to tell us were on the side.  We were seated rather quickly, but it was next to the hostess stand. We were being constantly shouted at by the girls calling the numbers \"number THREE\"!!!! It was very frustrating.  We mentioned it to our server and were told that they broke soon after they opened.  Yet they haven't come up with a better system other than shouting throughout the whole place.  After getting our food, my order wasn't as I had asked and had to be sent back. The other quesadilla I ordered tasted like pure onions. My fiance didn't care for his food either. We asked for to go boxes and got out as soon as we could. I got home and asked if he was going to eat his later.....he said no. We had to throw away 44 dollars worth of food.  We will not be returning. Our server Julio was very nice and attentive. He apologized and was very genuine. It wasn't his fault, that place needs a good manager to recognize how ticked off we, and everyone around us were with the method they are using to seat customers."}
{"text":"This place is great for cheap eats... Service is always prompt but the meal feels rushed as food arrives at lightning speed and as your plates are cleared the check arrives instantly after without even being offered desert, coffee, or even another drink. The food is tasty but not authentic Mexican. It is just a level or two  above fast food. Do yourself a favor stay away from the margaritas and just get a beer.  Save your money.... They are gross. I think I'll stick with Azteca. I only go here if other people I know are there."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, however this place is changing my mind. I ordered a chicken torta  and it was amazing. Everyone at their tables had margaritas, but I decided to go with the sangria. It was good! And $1.75! Can't beat that. Looking forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Been several times! Great food, great atmosphere, and  I have never had a problem! Definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a good Mexican Dish!"}
{"text":"When my husband says babe you wanna go grab something to eat? THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! We love the fajitas and they hare generous with their tequila! This is my favorite place, in and out quickly with good food every time."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at La Unica.  The salsa verde is incredible!!!  It's spicy and hot but it's got some avocado and jalepeno's in it and it's one of the best I've had.  I went off of another recommendation on here about their authentic tacos.  I went with 2 carne asada and 1 carnitas, they were so fresh with some onion and cilantro on top. I think the carne asada was my favorite.  I did also have a margarita and I would have to say that was probably my least favorite. It was just a regular one on the rocks, it's not the best I've had.  Overall, we will be back.  It was great!!!!"}
{"text":"So good. Must get the queso, it's honestly to die for. I always get the authentic chicken tacos and they are consistently delicious. Friendly staff and decent parking. They are always busy for lunch so arrive early"}
{"text":"The best mexican food in the Charlotte area now in a new location.  If you're reading any of the old location reviews,  you're probably finding most dinged La Unica for location size and ambiance.  That's fixed now with their new upscale standalone building.  The new location has 3 times the seating, and includes a full service bar as well,  and the drinks are even better than before.  (Looking forward to them adding outdoor seating as I see there is space for it)  Food remains the same as do many of the people taking care of you.  Which is to say, it's great.  Tacos remain a favorite here - the authentic tacos that is.  Very good carnitas and pastor.  Fajitas are top notch,  good cuts of meat, great flavor enhanced with a few supplied limes squeezed on, no oil or grease.  Really - none.  Vegetables are cooked just right,  not grilled to death and not to crisp.  These are my favorite fajitas anywhere in the country and they are always consistent - I eat them a couple times a month and have for the past few years.  Salsas are great as well.  Lots of flavor and plenty of kick.  There are two tomato based salsas that these guys bring out for everyone but my favorites are those that you have to ask for - get the green stuff.  Now let's look at the prices... A great value, and inline with if not below what you'd see at any run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  Except this is not run of the mill, it's excellent.  Mercedes Benz for the price of a Kia.  All in all - 1 star for consistency 2 stars great food  1 star great people 1 star a great drink  If I could go over five stars here I would.  Keep up the great work for your customers, I love your restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch since I was planning on doing some shopping at Birkdale.   I arrived before noon and this place was pretty packed. I was seated immediately and the chips and two salsas arrived. The chips were warm and both salsas were tasty. One was spicy and the other milder but still very good.   For my meal, I ordered the Lunch Chimichanga. It comes with a side of beans, lettuce and sour cream. I loved how quickly it arrived. But I was disappointed there wasn't any rice and I wasn't a fan of the beans.   So overall, I'd say my experience was just okay. If I'm in this side of town again and crazing Mexican I'd give them another try to see if I like another entree better."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican Restaurants in the area.  They serve two kinds of salsa with the chips...the chunkier one has a nice kick to it!    It seems like an odd thing to order, but one of their best menu items in my opinion is their Sopa de Pollo - fresh broth, shredded chicken (the real thing, not canned), rice, corn, pieces of guacamole, a touch of lime. Consistently delicious!    It's quite a busy place since their recent move to a much larger and nicer location.  I would expect any issues with slowness to resolve once they've adjusted."}
{"text":"For Mexican food in the Cornelius area this is pretty darn good. The service is fast, prices are reasonable, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I lovvvve their tacos. It ends here. 3 weeks ago we had a snow covering here in NC and I called ahead to see if they were and would be open...the man told me yes. I hopped in the car, drove the 2 miles here that it took and was denied service bc they were closing. There were still plenty of people inside and I told them it was me who had just called, they could not have cared less.  Fast forward to a new and much typical day here 3 weeks later and as soon as your buns hit the seat, they will ask you if you're ready to order. I expect this and keep coming back...for the tacos, but no longer. I came in for a quick bite by myself and was served a family sized portion of chips and 2 salsas. One hot and the other mild. I ordered a top shelf margarita with patron and ate my meal here and received my check. I asked for a box and Togo container for the chips and salsa that remained as I have done before with no problem. The gentleman told me that if I wanted to take them, that I would be charged for them if I was going to take them with me. Really? Soooo I'm just trying to come up with any sort of rational for this...they throw it away if you do not finish (I hope), give them to you without you ordering them as a complimentary item yet I will be charged to take this home? Wait, let's take this a step further. When you order takeout, chips and salsa come included free of charge...Unreal. Never again. I will take my business to El Toro. Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying this is a service review and not a food quality review.  I can't speak about the food because we never got a chance to order. My wife and I came here and saw it was real busy so that was a good sign. That's where the positivity ends,  our hostess seemed bothered by the fact that people were walking in and had a terrible way of seating us. We were rushed over to our table without a word and the menus and silverware placed down as she walked away. A young lady who was waiting on the table next to us just said \"hi\". We thought we would see her at our table again soon after.   We were sat as a table of two in the middle of a groups of six or more. That is where I can only guess we disappeared. Five, FIVE!!! Servers walked by us, three of whom I made eye contact with. Not one stopped by to take even a drink order. We sat at our table for ten(10) minutes without a single staff member stopping by. At that point I gave up as it felt like we weren't there. Three groups that sat after us received their drink orders and we decided to walk out. I would not have minded waiting for our drink and/or food orders, but I will not accept sitting at a table ignored while the groups behind us were attended to because they were larger than the two of us. It was my wife's birthday and I wasn't going to subject her to that treatment. It's a shame really, the food looked pretty good and the drinks were great sizes. Too bad we didn't get a chance to even order a cup of water"}
{"text":"Came here with family because I heard they have good house margaritas and food but alas the margaritas were rrrreeaaallly weak and the food was pretty average.   Not that this affected by rating but their booths are too narrow for baby carriers (snugride 35)."}
{"text":"Nasty fried tacos. It only comes with raw onions and clintros. Fish looks like French fries with no seasoning.  Bad.  Really bad!"}
{"text":"Returning from the  North at Christmas, we had dinner here.  Service was almost too fast; I think the chips and salsa got to the table before we did. My husband had two or three different tacos and I had the enchiladas.  Very fresh tasting.  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy due to the concrete floors, etc  Service was fine and price was reasonable.  Good variety.  We'll stop again."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican restaurant in the area. Love the lengua tacos. The horchata is delicious. The kids love the food.  Definitely will eat at La Unica again!"}
{"text":"Food was good- standard Mexican nothing overwhelmingly impressive.  Location is huge and was packed- we  didn't have a wait for our table of four- that us until we sat down- our server didn't show until 15 min after we were seated- he was unfriendly and inattentive requiring us to repeat the order more than once- he never came back to check on I us and we got drink refills from another server- Nothing I'd go out of the way to eat and probably won't return anytime soon because of the service-"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and great atmosphere.  Large bar area where you can enjoy a drink before dinner.  If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food in the LKN area, then look no further."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and pleasantly surprised! There were 2 types of salsa with the chips!! Had great lunch specials, mostly under 10 bucks! I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!! Food was very basic. Not one thing stood out as fantastic. I had the Carnitas it was just good. Again nothing over the top."}
{"text":"Best food around & the service is even better. The staff will go out of their way to please you & your taste! It's my favorite in Huntersville!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I drove forever up 77 to Huntersville to try out La Unica.  It was super busy on a Friday night, and we weren't even able to snag a seat at the bar - even it was two people deep in spots.  I took a buzzer and was able to grab a chair in the waiting area.    They gave us a 30-45 minute wait, but it didn't seem as long when the buzzer rang.  I quickly ordered a margarita when we were seated and took a look at the menu.  It seemed like typical mexican - and I never know what to order...  I ended up hastily deciding on the flautas.  Our meals were served quickly and were very good - my margarita was the part of the dinner that lacked some... tequila.    We ordered churros to go - and I didn't even get to taste those, so they must've been good!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in town! I love their cheese dip. So delicious. Pollo fundido is my recommendation."}
{"text":"We came here seeking great food and found it, but the service was awful. It was a Saturday night in July, so they were understandably busy, but we were seated in 15 minutes. It took 20 more minutes for someone to ask what our drink order was. The food took about 40 minutes to come out after that, but it was great. We never got refills nor did our waiter come by to check on us after someone else brought the food out. We had to ask for our cheese dip that was on the bill but not never brought out and we put it in my husband's take home box. The waiter was close to my Father's age and seemed stressed out and exhausted. He only had three tables in our little corner, and literally only came by to take our order, he never came back. Although the food was good, I wouldn't drive back up 77 to get take out and I certainly wouldn't bother to eat inside."}
{"text":"Guess, it is universal when you walk into a Mexican restaurant the chips and salsa dip come out.   Nice location and easy access. Parking lot is pretty active. Very spacious restaurant and lots of families come here.  Ordered the steak fajita which came out pretty quick and sizzling hot. However several of the steak pieces were charred.  Margarita was a little more on the green side.   Would like to make one suggestion to put spoons on the table or when bringing out an entree to put a spoon in it. The fork was very chintzy quality."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was very pleased. Originally from Los Angeles and have been looking for authentic tacos and I finally found them. Drinks are great; salsa taste yummy and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"There is Mexican food and Mexican slop. To tell the truth Taco Bell might be better. You get what you pay for. Might be a good place to get drunk. Maybe the food would be better. Not very appetizing and too many rules on the menu."}
{"text":"First Visit Since They Were Forced to Move  I had eaten several times at their old location but their landlord refused to renew their lease when Whole Foods went into the other end of the building.  Best thing that could have happened to this restaurant.  While functiional, the old location was still small compared to the number of patrons they served.  The new place is at least 100% larger and it's a much more confortable atmosphere.  Service was good at the old location and it's only gotten better.  Today I was greeted at the door, escourted to my seat and immediately after I was seated, my server was there and greeted me with a friendly smile and salsa and chips and took my drink order.  When she came back, I ordere the Steak Fajitas.  In less that 10 minutes, a steaming hot platter of meat , peppers and onions was proudly presented to me along with flour taco wraps, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and for sides, Spanish Rice and Refried Beans.  The platter was hugh and enough to serve two people and by that, let me emphaisize, I'm a big eater.  After I left, I now understand the reasoning behind a Siesta because I ended up going home and taking a nap.  Wish my wife liked Mexican so I could come more often but this is one place I will definately be back to."}
{"text":"If your a fan of authentic Mexican food then this is the best place in lake Norman. No matter what you order, it's delicious. Be careful not to eat too many chips before your meal which is easy to do.  I had the special Mexican quesadilla and it was huge. I rarely bring food home but I did tonight.  Great atmosphere and it's always busy, if you have to wait then try out the margaritas, they serve it with aristocrat so if you like other tequila then you can ask ahead."}
{"text":"So, after seeing the reviews on here, I am going to be slammed for mine.  After driving by the new location several times and seeing it packed each time, I decided to give it a try....twice.  The first visit was ok.  The décor and atmosphere is great.  They have done a great job with the bar and I thought this would be my new favorite place.  Then, the service and the food changed my mind.  Our server was nothing but short with us and at times rude.  When she brought the check we will still munching on the chips and she threw the check down right on top of the chips...um ok...thank you.    I got the carnitas torta which was ok, I have had better and the cheese dip was again ok.  It doesn't beat my favorite at Chicos over off Statesville and Gilead. The first experience was an ok experience and I decided to give it another shot.  The second time I went, my mom and I walked in and up to the hostess stand and she looked at us annoyed that we were interrupting her cell phone call and walked away.  We stood there until someone else seated us and took our drink order.  The annoyed cell phone server came over to take our order and proceeded to yell across the divider at the other servers standing there complaining about why didn't she get more tables.  Another server brought our food and I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo to compare to the one I get at Chicos.  There was no comparison.  It was down right awful...it tasted like someone took the cheap taco seasoning you get at the grocery store and dumped it on the chicken and sent it out.  My mom got a basic chicken soft taco and it was, again, what I call just ok.  We never had our drinks refilled and when the server walked by and asked us if we wanted anything she didn't stop a beat and kept right on walking while I asked for a refill.  After waiting about 15 min for our check, finally, a third server brought our check and asked us what we had ordered because she couldn't remember.  It just wasn't a pleasant experience either time and the food isn't enough for me to come back and deal with the service.  I really really wanted to like this place, but I will stick with Chicos.  It may not be as fancy on the inside, but the food is always good, the service friendly and never a shortage on chips and salsa.  Maybe I'll give it another shot down the road...but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on here I was quite excited to try this place, so after 20 mins of convincing my friends that this was a place we needed to check out off we were.  Upon being seated I noticed a Mexican family being served and noticed they all had ordered hamburger and fries, I thought to myself-that's ironic....  I got the chicken mole. Shredded chicken in a sauce that I can best describe as tasting like a cross between manwich and mole sauce. Not what I was expecting, not terrible but if you are wanting authentic mole look elsewhere.  Both friends got the chili rellenos. Aaaaaand both got an unstuffed maybe? Anaheim pepper wrapped in a fried egg??? Not sure where they came up with that one but again, both said it wasn't terrible just not what they were expecting.  After getting our food I wished I had taken the cue from the family I saw being served when we came in and ordered gringo style-btw, their food looked really good.  And finally, service was terrible. We saw our waiter twice the hour and a half we were there. Once to order after a 20 min wait and once to see \"how everything was\" as we were finishing up.  I won't be back, too many other options and their prices are kind of high for what they offer. Pulling into the parking lot we had to hunt for a parking spot, thus I was figuring this place was going to be great. This place stays packed! At which I'm amazed. Not sure if I've been spoiled by some of the better Mexican in Charlotte or this is the best option in this area.  Either way, good for them. Selling mediocre food at an inflated price and just churning the customers in and out has to be lucrative-just not on this gringo's dime anymore."}
{"text":"The food was really greasy and the rice was dry.  The beans were good, but the guacamole was really chunky and thick. I ordered the Yolandas off the dinner menu, which was supposed to be three chicken enchiladas and rice and guacamole salad. I received an enchilada with greasy ground beef, one with chicken (which was ok), and one filled with beans. The salsa was store bought and not that great. The margaritas were huge, but a tad overpriced in my opinion. Will probably not visit again. Sorry :("}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Mexican food.  The new La Unica space is wonderful.  Much more room than their old spot.  The ambiance is what you would expect and the food is still fantastic.  There are only two reasons I can't give a five-star rating.  First, they don't accept AMEX.  Second, some of the staff does not speak well enough English and sometimes messes up the order.  However, the last few times we've been there they seem to have hired more people that speak better English so this is being addressed.  Overall, I can definitely recommend LaUnica.  Great Mexican Food!  That's all there is to it!"}
{"text":"New location seats more patrons but the food and service are both average, nothing more. Restaurant features the standard Mexican fare but nothing stands out. Ok for a cheap dinner but don't expect anything unique ( see what I did there? )"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it has been OK.  not great but not bad.  service is questionable some times.  i like Zapatas in Cornelius better."}
{"text":"La Unica continues to be some of the best Mexican I have tasted in the nation.   The food is always served hot and fresh and the customer service here is terrific.  I would recommend the arroz con pollo, and a huge margarita. The fajitas are also wonderful."}
{"text":"Ordered food at 8:15. They said it would be 10-15 min. I arrived at 8:45 and my food was not ready. The girl had to ask what I ordered and go have them make it. Do you not write this stuff down???? The food that was supposed to take 10-15 min ended up taking almost 45 min.  not happy to say the least."}
{"text":"Wow, this was the poorest Mexican food we have ever eaten. We knew things were strange when the house Sangria came out loaded with club soda instead of wine & fruit.  My husband ordered a mojito and it was worse,came in a very tall glass FULL of club soda. Very little rum, sugar & mint. The service was fine, but the food was mainly covered in cheese and tasteless. I now know why the parking lot is full some nights-  it reminds us of shopping mall food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new location. Great service. Tons of TVs. Really neat wrap around bar.   Warm chips kick ass salsa... Ask for the salsa verde, or the green salsa for all you gringos :) It's a jalapeno and avocado salsa that is spicy and delicious!  Pro tip... Don't wait for a table just sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"A bunch of my Davidson buddies met up to say farewell to one of our friends before she leaves the county and they selected La Unica for dinner.   The service was so-so (not stellar and not poor) as the waitress showed little to no expression but was quick and got our orders correct. I had the enchiladas verdes with the side of rice and beans. The sides were great but the chicken was a bit dry in this dish. The rest of my table seemed to enjoy what they ordered and we had queso dip for the table. The dip was great and the chips were very tasty. It would not be my choice to return as there are other options for Mexican food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times and ordered online. The mole sauce is very good, I usually get that with chicken. Sometimes it can be a little off with the sauce to meat ratio ends up turning into a soup, but for the most part consistently tasty. The service is always good, even when I've gone with big groups the waitresses take orders correctly and are prompt with bringing drinks/refills/chips."}
{"text":"Food was TERRIBLE. Felt like we were eating skim milk/ watered down queso. Ordered 3 different tacos.. they all tasted like bland boiled unseasoned chicken. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Tex Mex not authentic Mexican food it was ok but would not be my first, second, third choice. Yeah I'm a Mexican food snob but I do know good Mexican and this ain't it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I usually enjoy what I order.  The service was inconsistent when I went on Friday.  My mother and I went for lunch.  I ordered the quesadilla lunch special recommended by the server, which I enjoyed.  My mom ordered a taco and burrito combo.  She enjoyed the food.  However her chicken taco had a two inch bone inside.  We showed the waitress, a different one than we'd had at first.  She looked at us blankly, didn't apologize or even seem surprised.  She said she's tell them (the kitchen staff).  We weren't offered more chips, but I asked for them.  We didn't receive refills on our iced teas. Our original server did run my card so that I didn't have to take it to the register, which was nice.  This was not a busy time for the restaurant, so it seemed half of the service was lax.  I had my baby with us and both waitresses fawned over her, which was sweet.  I'll eat here again, but would prefer more attentive service and not to have bones in the chicken."}
{"text":"New location, same great food and much better atmosphere. Really love this place and just about everything on the menu. The service is extremely fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I tried this place due to all of the great review's.  Server acted like he had sonething better to do. The atmosphere was awesome would def go for appetizers but not for dinner. Food came out quick and was hot. Overall overhyped mexican food."}
{"text":"This review needs to be split into two parts: food and service. Based on the food, I would give this restaurant a 4-5 stars. The food is high quality and very tasty. The salsa is spicy and fresh. The quality of the food is beyond other Mexican restaurants in the area and all is worth the fair prices. With that being said, I would suggest this restaurant as a 'take out' experience only. My husband and I have eaten here twice and both times the service was TERRIBLE.   The first time we went we were waited on by a female waitress. I asked for lemon for my water 4 times before she finally remembered to check the bar and came back to inform me they were out of lemon - not sure how that happens but not a big deal. As our meal progressed, she continued to forget to refill drinks and began clearing our table before we were even finished eating. She literally removed my husbands knife and plate while he still had a few bites left. She also removed our chips and other items before we were completely done. My husband ordered a beer and she cleared his glass before he took the last couple of chugs. I was very upset with the rushed service and continued removal of items from our table that we were OBVIOUSLY not done with.   The second visit was today. We were waited on by a male waiter. We sat at the table for about 10-12 minutes before he came by to ask what we wanted to drink. By that time, the bartender had already taken our drink order and gave us menus. We had to ask for chips and salsa which usually hits the table as soon as you sit down. We gave the male waiter our order and that was the last time we saw him. We were brought our food by one of the food runners and our waiter ran by our table real quick to see if we needed anything, which we didn't. Our drinks stayed empty from that time until we actually left the restaurant. He never checked on us again after our food was brought. We had to flag him down for a to go box and our check. At that time, he still never made mention about our empty drinks or lack of attention after our food came out (we were also out of salsa and wanted to get some extra sour cream which never happened). The part we didn't understand was he passed our table at least 10 times during this time but never stopped. To say the least, we will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY, read again, ONLY place in Charlotte that you will get an authentic Mexican taco. The place is always busy, food is always fresh and the service is outstanding. Thinking about Mexican food? Come here for sure! It is worth the wait (which is never more than 10 minutes) and the money!"}
{"text":"Solid place for Mexican-American food. Giant beers and margaritas, all of the typical Mexican dishes, and a few really good authentic dishes."}
{"text":"La Unica is the best in town!  They just moved to a bigger and better location and they are now up and running smoothly. I have tried several items on the menu and I am always happy!  The staff is friendly and the owner is awesome!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home from shopping at Concord Mills.  The restaurant was super-busy, but we had a short wait time for a table. The service was excellent and fast. Chips and 2 types of salsa were served immediately and we ordered a side of their cheese dip.  All of our food was delicious.  The Fajitas Texanas are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. I had been to the one in Mooresville and the food quality and quantity are the same at both places. Tonight I had the Tijuana carnitas burrito and it was fantastic! I asked for a salsa verde an it was so tasty and spicy, the server noticed I liked it and she offered me another option that was delicious and even more spicy  Good food, good prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very tasty and always hot and fresh. The restaurant is huge, lots of seating, always kept clean, decor is amazing, and the staff is very friendly and wonderful."}
{"text":"The place that lost its way....sad to say this used to be one of our favorites but since they expanded the service, drinks , and even the food has lost its way.  Food was just ok, my skinny margarita was watered down sprite, and we received no waters.  Hope they get their groove back."}
{"text":"Love this place so much it was out every Friday night date night.  We also planned a lot of our wedding here as well.    The food is consistent and made well with great spice.  The staff are impeccable and three Pico de Gallo is out of this world."}
{"text":"Great local mexican food near Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"Ugh, Not for me.  Bland food, millions of kids, big crowds.  All for some not-really- \"Mexican\" food.  I had combo plate 14 = smallest burrito (ground beef in a flour tortilla (nothing else), smallest enchilada (again ground beef in a soft corn tortilla) and a Tamale (breading with a small little bit of beef in it).  She had chicken Chimichanga (bland chicken in a flour tortilla (barely fried)).  There was only two salsas presented (not four like on the website), hot was too hot, and mild was just some bland \"taco sauce\".  I am not sure why the place was crowded.  I'll keep looking..."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and drinks last night! My husband loved the tacos in there fresh hard shells. Chili relano was the best we've ever had. Margaritas and Sangria were authentic. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is decent, not fantastic and not terrible. The salsa is very flavorful--they bring you hot and mild. I ordered the chicken chimichanga. It was a bit doughy for me, I prefer them crispy. It was good and came with rice and beans, sour cream and tomatoes. The service this time was not very good. My waiter was consumed with watching soccer on the tv along with the rest of the wait staff. I will be back but they are better Mexican restaurants around, just not a ton in Huntersville."}
{"text":"I love the food here -- very authentic. My problem is on take out orders. We take out most times and always something will be left out (last three times). It is impossible to check at the restaurant since they package and tie everything so tightly. But the food is great."}
{"text":"We use to eat here at least once a week until we moved. Best Mexican food around! Gets crowded but the service is super fast so the wait is never long!  Think my husband has tried everything on the menu at least once."}
{"text":"Their portion sizes are very disappointing. Their super chimichunga enteee is the smallest portion I've seen at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We went here on a Monday evening. Not packed, but a healthy crowd of people. Service was quick and extremely friendly. Food was hot, tasty and quick. It was the first time we had been there so the waiter took time to explain dishes. We ordered the skirt steak, burrito and fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican resteraunt among all we have been to. I am so glad it's in our neighborhood. Reasonable price, good food, excellent service. The salsa and the chips are so fresh and the best ever!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything from here but the fiancé seems to enjoy the food. This is mostly about their customer service since I'm the one who's picked up the food from here. Last time when my fiancé went to get the food he forgot his wallet at home. Rather than making him go home and then come back, they took his name and number and his word that he'd be back to pay them.  We ended up giving them our card number over the phone (and they didn't repeat it out loud like Thai Sushi 101 did), but it was pretty nice that they were willing to let it slide until next time.   That's the kinda service that gets you repeat business.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's as dysfunctional as Mexico is. It has a feeling of a Mexican restaurant but señor frogs is in a whole different league. Service has no idea what table is theirs. There AC doesn't work. And the reason why there is always a wait is because no one gets a chance to order."}
{"text":"La Unica is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Huntersville/Charlotte. They have the white queso dip, great house margaritas and really good entrees. The Super Chimichanga and California Burrito are my go-to dinner choices."}
{"text":"Food and service is well below average. For Mexican in this area go to azteca or taxco."}
{"text":"The food is your average Mexican food, nothing special. I like how cheap it is but with the food being average and how horrible the service is EVERY time I've been there, I wouldn't recommend going. Since it seems like the only traditional Mexican place around I've been quite a few times and I've never had good service. I've never had the waitress come back and ask if my food is alright or need anything. I don't know if they are understaffed or maybe I catch them at bad times, but when you have to track down your waitress to refill your drink or that you'd like another beer/margarita, it's annoying. Also it's bad for their business sales. They could have sold more and made more money!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I was expecting more originality given some of the personal reviews I had heard. Definitely worth a return visit to explore the vast menu more."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had by the front house staff. Tried to call and make a reservation for 15 on a Friday night for a surprise birthday. Would not seat us until the birthday girl was here because they won't seat until 1/2 the party is here. What a crappy way to treat paying customers. Won't be coming there for any other event ever"}
{"text":"I've passed this restaurant many times, as its on the way to Birkdale.  Its a great little location hidden off by itself, but you can't miss it when you drive by. I believe the open the windows in the summer to give it a more open feel.  Great service.  Yummy Margaritas. And a friendly/fun environment."}
{"text":"This will probably be my new go to Mexican restaurant!  This place was delicious and the service was fantastic!  I went with a co worker of mine and we were served chips and salsa immediately.  It came with two different salsas.  One was spicy and the other was a standard salsa, they were both delicious!  I mixed mine together and it was fantastic!  Our drink order was also taken immediately and then our food order followed after receiving our drinks.  I ended up getting the lunch chicken chimichanga which came with beans too.  It was delicious!  Probably the best chicken chimichanga I've had in a while!  The beans were also delicious.  While we were eating I noticed a waiter going out of his way to be sweet and energetic to a little girl which you don't typically see at restaurants and it put a big smile on my face.  Also, the restaurant is extremely clean!  The floor was spotless!  Even though this restaurant is a bit further away from us, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"La Unica is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  Always a solid meal, and it is always packed.  That's a good sign!  Pretty big on the inside, so don't let a crowd deter you.  Their chips are crispy, not greasy and they bring out plenty of fresh salsa.  The cheese dip and guacamole are both great, and the food is also flavorful.  My favorite dish is the Mexicana Quesadilla off of the lunch menu.    Parking is plentiful, they offer take out and service is always great.  This is a real gem."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Everyone I know (for the most part) raves and raves about La Unica. I don't know why. The menu is overwhelming, for starters, and nothing I've ever had there leaves me wanting more-you know, wanting to savor the last bite? Not here.   I do want to give a shout out to our servers who made serving a table of 16 or so look like cake. You guys were the bomb, and you never made us feel like a bother. Props to you guys!   Menu prices are average. It's a very reasonable place to eat at, somewhat convenient to I-77 if you're familiar with LKN.   For the food... The chips are good, light and crispy, but the salsas are bent on the extremes. One is way too bland and puréed while the other is too hot and chunky. When you mix the two you get a decent salsa ? I ordered a drink from the bar and, out of all I ordered, it was the best thing (Long Island Iced Tea, although it was really small, the skimped on the mixers, not the liquor.) Hard to go wrong on drinks. My friends ordered margaritas, and those looked amazing though I can't attest to how they were.   I ordered tacos in three varieties: chorizo, barbacoa, and asada. All tacos are topped with cilantro and onions. I was hoping that the meat was seasoned well. All tacos had a generous portion of meat (high five on the filling) and here's how it played out: Chorizo-nice flavor, but the meat was dried out. No one likes dry meat.  Asada-flavorless, I needed salsa on the taco for emotional support.  Barbacoa-the most moist of any meat, tender, tasty, but GREASY. There was a pool of fat on my plate, ready for any brave taco divers.   I DO like that their tacos are double stacked because corn tortillas tear easily, but these were yummy!   Also tried some queso. Word to the wise-don't. It's bland. When you have to sit there and close your eyes and give yourself a pep talk, saying \"you're eating queso, taste that cheese!\" here's your sign.   Dinner summed up in the word:blah. I won't return unless there's another friend gathering that I don't plan because this isn't my favorite spot. I wish it's something I could like, but Mexican can be so much better than this."}
{"text":"The food is not the best, and while the staff makes you feel welcome it never makes it to a level of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots, the food is consistently good. The service has been a little hit-or-miss since they moved into the bigger location, but generally they are friendly and fast. If you like crazy-spicy food, ask for their green salsa!"}
{"text":"Great fast service, family friendly, great margaritas. The carnitas authentic tacos are very good & cheap! They can handle a crowd, too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, small portions for the price, chips and salsa must be a hot commodity,  as they treat them as if they are gold"}
{"text":"This location used to be Cheeseburger in Paradise. Man, I miss that place! Why did they have to leave? Anyway...  La Unica is good. Never disappointed, never blown away. It's authentic Mexican food, but to be honest, I enjoy On the Border more. Don't know why. The service at La Unica is good, but the wait staff seems stressed and will never really take time to engage in conversation (which is fine, but some people care about that stuff). I haven't spent any time at the bar, but it looks comfy, especially with a game on.  Just a heads-up: Don't you dare take those mints on the way out! They cost $0.25 each. Damn!"}
{"text":"yum! Have visited this place a few times now and it's great every time. Quick service, good authentic mexican food. My favorite thing is it isn't extremely loud like most mexican restaurants tend to be. SO relieved to walk in and NOT see a mariachi band lol. Definitely check this place out if you want fast delicious Mexican food"}
{"text":"We loved y ho s place at their old location and thier new location didnt disappoint. The foodwas great and y he new location was very festive. Service was also great.  The only downer was the noise. It stays busy and it is noisy."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Our service was not good. We stood around for several minutes before even being acknowledged and seated. Then the food just wasn't good. I don't know how anyone can mess up chicken and rice, but they managed to. We waited forever for the check. Coworkers love this place, but I just can't see why!"}
{"text":"If God was a Mexican restaurant this would surely be him! This place is AMAZEBALLS and I don't have one bad thing to say about it! Quick service, delicious food, and great prices!  My office is less than a mile from this restaurant and my coworkers and I just love going here! They have a great lunch menu with prices around $5-$7 for a entire meal. The lunch portions are just enough to fill you up, but not have you slumping over your desk all afternoon. :) When you arrive at the restaurant a hostess seats you and you are immediately given chips with two salsa options, mild and spicy. I really like the spicy one and it might be the best salsa I've ever had. I love that they give each person their own dipping bowl. Can you say double dip, please??   And talk about speed! I kid you not, it probably takes 7 mins for your entire table's food to come out. ANDDD it's piping hot! That's what I call Q U A L I T Y! This is a full service restaurant and we can be in and out within 30 mins or spend another 30 mins chatting before heading back to work.  When I come here I order the Lunch Chicken Chimichangas, Lunch Enchilldas, Lunch Chicken Fajitas, or one of the normal combinations (if I'm realllly hungry). Delicious.   If you're ever in the Huntersville area, stop here for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food avocado delight is good ! Love love love green salsa.service it good. Wait times are very minimal if you go at 7 restaurant clears out by 8"}
{"text":"Love Mexican food! This restaurant is reasonably priced. The serving sizes are large too. The taste is good but I would not consider it excellent Mexican food.   I also felt a bit rushed by the server. There were plenty of tables and we were wanting to talk after our meal. But server even came and took our glasses away after we finished our food.   Have not yet found a great Mexican restaurant in the area. Would go back here but hope to find a better one in our future search."}
{"text":"Came back to La Unica again and it never changes. Great Mexican food, good honest drinks, great bar and fantastic service. Treat yourself and the family. This place is my favorite restaurant in huntersville."}
{"text":"I really like the seating in here. Servers were very nice. Food was fine. Their salsas and chips did not taste super fresh. Margaritas were huge & reasonably priced compared to Azteca. I enjoy the atmosphere here- so we'll go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the old one but much more room. Would love a little faster service and or staff but like the owner and the food is really good. Make sure you get top shelf liquor for the best drinks"}
{"text":"The food is great. The margaritas are giant!!! I love the atmosphere. Lots of families. Love the chips and salsa. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night. Was full and lively. Fun place for drinks and friends, family, a date. It's a casual place that is afforadable and pretty quik service. I ordered the cheese steak burrito. Which was pretty good!  Portions are good. We'll be back. By the way, the medium size margarita is perfect"}
{"text":"I am NOT a Mexican food connoisseur - just want to put that out there. I'm happy with plain Taco Bell food, but this place is AMAZING. I mean, just fantastic. The service was quick, the salsa and chips were amazing, and everyone loved their entrees. I got the taco plate with beans and rice and it was just delicious. I will come back over and over."}
{"text":"Ok, new location, new review.  Went there today for lunch for the first time since they moved to their new location. Was a little concerned when I heard they were moving to the old cheeseburger in paradise location, it's sorta out of the way and CIP didn't last too long there. Was very happy to see a large lunchtime crowd there, and this place is 2, 3 times larger than the old one.  Thrilled to report prices haven't gone up, food is maybe even better than at the old location, service is fantastic. The new location is fantastic, what a wonderful job they did decorating the place, a great layout and a HUGE sit at , u shaped bar. I said before this was my favorite Mexican Restaurant. I'm going to change that, it's now my favorite Restaurant I'd give it ten stars if I could.  Oh dear lord,  went there for lunch today, 12/3/2014. Most Awesome Restaurant ever."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by two different coworkers. So I thought I was in for a treat.    It had been a while since we had a proper Mexican meal and since we were celebrating my man's birthday - we came here.   It started off bad. I opened my menu and it was dirty. I mean it smelled and liquid dripping out. The waitress saw me cleaning the menu and didn't even offer to give me a new one.   She did bring out our salsa and chips and we thought it was super cute how they Serve the salsa in bottles and you can pour yourself. However one salsa tasted like flavored tomato sauce. And the chips although greasy were stale. It was very weird.   We ordered shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were not deveined. And the sauce was very sweet. Overall 2.5 out of 5.   I ordered the chimichanga plate and I cannot express how small the chimichanga was. I mean kid size for sure. The nacho sauce on top was not tasty and the beans it was served was a no go for me. The chicken on the inside of my chimichanga was moist. 2.5/5  My man ordered chilaquiles with rice and beans. Normally when you order chilaquiles it will plentiful and beautiful. His plate lacked any luster. The tortilla chips over soggy and the flavor was disappointing. After my first bite he asked if I wanted another, and there was no way I was going to eat anymore.   My son enjoyed his burger and fries. But us on the other hand, neither of us finished our meal. We only finished the shrimp cocktail since it was $12.   I felt bad. This was supposed to be a special meal and it was very disappointing. Catch me at Three Amigos next time."}
{"text":"Love coming here! It's cheap and good. Sometimes I wish the service was a little better but overall it's my go to Mexican in this area"}
{"text":"We loved La Unica in their old location and we finally made it to their newer, bigger, fancier location.  We live near the place and driving by in the evenings and looking at the packed parking lot, it looks like they will continue to be successful.  The food was as good as it always was and the only ding I'll give on this review is the service was a little slow and it took a while for the food to come out.  That was never an issue in the previous location and we went many, many times.    We continue to be glad that La Unica remains so good and so close!"}
