{"text":"Had a nice quiet dinner here, amazing friendly service and tasty spaghetti. The portions are perfect and I'm not sure if the pasta was made fresh or cooked from dry; either way, it was enjoyable. House wine is quite decent too. Super affordable prices especially for the quality you get. Ambiance is standard/good but I can't say it is romantic - I will definitely go back for lunch with a friend!"}
{"text":"J'ai soupé à cet endroit hier soir avec des amis. La cuisine est plus qu'excellente, les pâtes fraîches, la baguette de pain à l'ail grillé, le tiramisu, tout était authentiquement italien et délicieux. L'apparence du resto et la tenue des serveurs ne fait pas très classe, mais la nourriture semble provenir d'un resto d'hôtel 5 étoiles. Bravo Chef!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a dinner with friends one cold, winter evening. Service was service warm and helpful. I choose octopus whenever possible and this one was outstanding and very reasonably priced. There were tables available when we arrived but it was quite full by the time we left. This is definitely a popular spot and I can see why."}
{"text":"Having lived near the Monkland Village for over two decades, I usually head to Little Italy whenever the cravings strike for an authentic Italian meal. No more. Amerigo changed all that, thanks to a classic menu of truly great pasta dishes including some of the best spaghetti amatriciana I've ever tasted. They also have a variety of focaccia options including a sublime truffle and egg dish that is addictive.. We started with the arrancini and meatball appetizers which were both bursting with fresh ingredients and surprisingly light. I tried the prosciutto and arugula focaccia which was perfect and  my wife ordered the porchetta, and so I managed to get in a few forkfulls of an incredibly moist and succulent slow roasted pork dish that brought me back the porchetta I had sampled in Umbria. They also  have a ridiculously affordable wine selection, and where else are you going to get a Negroni for 6 bucks. What can I say. I love this place."}
{"text":"Excellente petite place pour de la cuisine italienne. Tout est excellent, et le menu change au gré du chef."}
{"text":"Small place yet very comfortable. Staff is very friendly, food quantity is HUGE. Great for casual dates and family. They are also a store selling all kinds of Italian food products."}
{"text":"Incredibly impressed with how local this felt. Food was delicious and shockingly cheap ($15 for squid ink pasta vongole? Come on). Very friendly service though it took quite a bit of time to get our food on a pretty busy night. Making this my new go to neighbourhood Italian."}
{"text":"Pleasant place, but with mediocre food (except very good calamari, lightly cooked in a light, crispy batter). My cod was nicely cooked but not fresh enough. The lobster ravioli  had little lobster flavour.  Service was frustratingly  slow. This on a night with only about two thirds of tables filled."}
{"text":"Cute little italien resto/supermarket in NDG. Its hard to find a great pasta place in montreal, so I was happy to get introduce to this one and the pasta dishes were legit! I loved the vintagy italien deco and the fact that you can shop desert and fresh meat while taking a little pasta break! I recommend the calamary starter dish, it was super flavourful."}
{"text":"Best italian/pasta experience you're ever going to have away from Italy. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I finally tried this little gem on Monkland for myself to curb an ever present pasta craving and it really hit the spot! Really nice cozy atmosphere (indoor and outdoor seating) with that great NDG neighbourhood feel (the seating is a little tight inside but still comfortable), warm and friendly customer service oriented staff and delicious food , you can't really go wrong. We tried the Bellini (refreshing but not too sweet) and the old fashioned (this one was good too but strong!), only thing is the drinks were a little small. Naturally we opted for pasta dishes -We tried the tagliatelle with veal ragu (bolognese) and the cavatelli barese (sundried tomato, Italian sausage and rapini). Both were delicious and had that home cooked feel with restaurant quality complexe flavours , great texture and cook on both pastas. The dishes are served with bread/olive oil and salad to start. The salad was simple mixed greens and light dressing , the greens were crisp and the dressing was light&flavourful. The bread was fresh&the olive oil was tasty. I'm already thinking about all their other dishes that I want to go back and try so it's safe to say I will definitely revisit this place again and again !"}
{"text":"Had to try this neighbourhood restaurant based on the great reviews and the inviting look of the place as I drove by...and I wasn't disappointed! Service, food and ambiance were great! Nice outdoor terrace, cozy interior with authentic Italian products (for purchase) surround you on all the shelves. I had dore  and my friend had the lamb shank and both were delicious, served with a simple green salad. Cappuccino was great! Our waiter's personality and warmth added to the enjoyment! Will definitely return!"}
