{"text":"I went to the original one on Ste Catherines for the 2-3 am scoffs and even Keeble was amazed as to how I can pack it in. I went there with Mark Vanderbol a couple of times and he just ate for 1 hour straight ,so it was safe to say I helped  introduce,many of my old friends, girlfriends, football buddies to commercialized good greek fare,. the guys on the line loved it when we came in cause we tipped and it was just that way cause they would pile on the mild sauce and pile on the yero meat and that was a heluva job. I went there with Poly 1 time in 88 to celebrate his being picked number 3 in the CFL draft ,after a big nite at THURSDAYS and Crescent st. We ate for 6 people ,true story. I look forward to 1 day going back and having my favourite submarine,ciaociao  Mou"}
{"text":"If there was a sauce that could instantly put you in a place of pure extacy and as each bite bring your mouth to water like niagra fall. Then Kojax's has got it with their mild sauce. As for their nenu eh and for the life of me I would truly would like to know how does a greek restaurant has the nerve to sell Taco's and doesn't koptia with that mild sauce . I guess a lack gonads to be the Only place that would offer such a delicious treat ."}
{"text":"The Yero trio always makes for yummy lunch. Their toothsome pita makes biting into the sandwich a wonderful experience, and the all-dressed original yero-meat drizzled with hot sauce all melds together into an ever satisfying lunch. Their big fat fries are wonderful as well, but if you're getting take-out you WILL run out of ketchup. 3 little packs of brand name ketchup is no match for these fries."}
{"text":"Giving it 2 stars for convenience and service. The staff is always polite and very efficient, and it's in a great location. Prices are also decent, so if you're craving Greek food then it's adequate.   The food doesn't go much further than that for me. Maybe it's just when I go, but every time I've been there the food's been less than what I expected and have come to experience from other Kojax locations. If you can get yourself somewhere else, then do so. If not, prepare to be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I ate at Kojax many times as a university student in Montreal, it was perfect for a quick meal in between classes (and at the right price).  This was also my \"go to\" spot when the bars closed at 3am (I woke up many mornings with the familiar Kojax sauce on my shirt).   Service has always been consistently excellent here, a rarity for a fast food restaurant.  It's probably been 25 years since my first visit and they always have friendly staff who prepare the food quickly and with a smile. The restaurant is entirely red & white  - the traditional Kojax colors, and very bright but you don't come here for the atmosphere.  You come for the Gyro. If you don't know what this is, it's a warm fresh Pita with strips of beef roasted on a vertical spit, tomatoes, onions and Kojax special sauce. I order the same thing every time, so good.  Over the years, I tried a few of the food court locations and found them not up to par. You need to go to this St. Catherine location to ensure you get the real Kojax experience.  Fast food done right. I guess that's why the place has been there for so long...  BK"}
{"text":"For those of you from out of town, this is a small, local chain of souvlaki and yero (gyro, or doner, if you prefer) joints that's been around forever.  I've been eating their stuff since the early eighties.  I'll the give you the bad news first:  they're a *chain*.  There are some things they do in an utterly formulaic way;  the sides, especially.  The fries and rice are elementary school cafeteria-quality, at best, and can be safely avoided.  Their yero is nothing special;  it's meatloaf.  I haven't bothered to get one of their salads in ten or fifteen years.  What draws me back, time and time again, is their pork souvlaki.  On pita.  And not with the silly white sauces, no;  with the red, *hot* sauce.  A Greek friend tells me the red sauce is a pretty common thing in Greece, but I've yet to find any other souvlaki joint in Montreal that offers it.   And that red sauce, gentle reader, is the secret.    Picture this:  Griddle-fried pita.  Grilled pork cube kebab.  A generous mound of fresh, shredded lettuce and bright sliced onion;  a few slices of beefsteak tomato;  all laced with a spoonful of a deep, salty, tangy, spicy peppery-dark red sauce that bears gratifyingly little resemblance to ketchup.  Rolled into a tight cone, and handed to you piping hot.  Bite into *that*.  Now picture that, at the end of a cold day spent walking downtown.  Three of those, to go.  With a good pale ale to wash them down waiting at home.  Oh, mercy."}
{"text":"I'm a regular when it comes to Kojax traditional souflaki with extra mild sauce - its mouth watering!but this location loses stars because of its lack of cleanliness! Fruit flies swirming around the garbage, bathroom with toilet paper over the sink  in  great need of a makeover! I won't be coming back here unless I'm super hungry for a pit stop   -which was the exception tonight. But amiable service"}
{"text":"Good pita sandwich, Took my order and left because it was an ok looking place to me, if I'm in a bind and want to avoid subway I will definitely go to Kojax but dagwoods has my heart though it's Greek vs Canadian which can't really be compared but hey going by my preferences here! So yeah.."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Pleasant experience but fries clogged throat. Hard to swallow clogged throat. Do not eat fry if you have small throat. Maybe smaller than 2in diameter. Good luck."}
{"text":"It's food-court food.  Apparently some of them are chains (Subway, Quiznos, Basha, etc.)  The souvlaki I had was good, but then again, I've never had it.  Wish they had lamb."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian plate which came with salad, fries and rice. The rice was microwaved (I know because I saw the guy microwaving before serving me) and had little flavour. There was no dressing for the salad which I found odd. Usually Mediterranean restaurants put tatziki or something on the side. Portions are not very big for the amount you are paying. The servers were kind though however the food is not worth returning or recommending."}
{"text":"Really not good.  Taste awful.  Got sick. Wrote to the company and they gave me  Kojax money which was sweet went back and got sick again. I'm Greek it's not me its this company."}
{"text":"It's a taste of my childhood and I can't remember the last time I had anything from Kojax before this past week. I went for what I remembered: a Kojax burger with mild sauce and an order of fries. I feel like it wasn't as good as I remembered but certainly not bad. It was really filling - even with my dog taking a few fries off my hands. The burger is like a gyro piled onto a cheap sesame hamburger bun and doused with sauce. While I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it, if you're in the area and want something a little different it will certainly do the trick."}
{"text":"Been going to Kojax since my teen years.   Big fan of the mild sauce use for Souvflaki.   Best time is the one on St-Catherine street, between Bishop and Crescent, 3am after the bars close.  Nothing like a Souvflaki Pita (porc of course) with that mild sauce to finish the night!"}
{"text":"In the late 90's when i lived in Montreal we worked right down the street from Kojax, we ate many a lunch, snack or late night drunk fest here. I was pleasantly surprised to see its still here and in the same location with the same food and cafeteria style set up. So reliving my youth over ordered everything i used to order here at the food is still fantastic and serves a very specific purpose, cheap, delicious and fast. Perfect. Poutine Fries, Chicken Souvlaki and Gyro, loved it!"}
{"text":"Je suis très désappointée de la commande que j'ai reçue, bien sûre, le service de livraison à sa part dans tout ça, mais sa reste que le restaurant aurait dut voir à plusieurs points comme par exemple  - ne pas mettre la sauce sur la poutine pour ne pas la détremper et risquer de la renverser comme s'est arriver -ne pas mettre la vinaigrette sur la salade pour ne pas la détremper, mais surtout ne pas mettre la salade dans le même plat que tous les éléments chaud... c'était dégueulasse, un vrai gaspillage! - Le service de livraison à été extrêmement long... plus de 45min quand le commerce se trouve à 10min de marche de chez nous, en plus de 5$ de frais qui devrait faire en sorte que le livreur fasse bien sa job MAIS ALORS LÀ NON!  - ils on oublier mon extra sauce tatziki dans ma commande  - tout était sec et froid (sauf la salade, elle était bien trempé et chaude) ?   Tout ça pour un total de 40$... pour deux repas bien ordinaire. Du vrai vol. J'espère que leur service sur place est meilleur ! Je vous joint les photos... et j'ai pas tout dit"}
{"text":"Just had the gyro combo here. This is not Kronos (my favorite), that is for sure. The taste of the gyro was somewhat bland, as well as the taste of the fries (though they are steak fries, which is plus). Not too much of a garlic flavor, and the sauce tasted more like straight up yogurt. Would I eat here if I specifically wanted a gyro? Maybe, but there seems to be other options in the food court."}
{"text":"The Yero's at Kojax remind me more of the donair sandwiches from Halifax (don't crucify me for saying that) - but with the sweet garlic sauce, and the super compressed yero meat, it's a close comparassion that the city can offer.   When I think of Kojax - two things come to my mind. Their great garlic sauce, and their wedge fries. Kojax doesn't serve you normal fries, Instead to get these 1/2 inch fries that are nice and crispy.   Overall Kojax is a great fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the things I like the most is their friendly customer service. I have to say that the food is also very good, fresh salads, and good meats, so if you need a quick lunch and you like Middle Eastern food then this is the place to come."}
{"text":"I'm a native Montrealer who lives in the US and this is the first place I want to eat at when I get into the city. It's a Greek fast food chain,and I've been going here since my high school days, so yes, I'm a long time customer! ;-) I've been to Greece, and have had the \"original\" souvlaki and know that none of the fast food chains or even actual restaurants truly come close to it, but I don't really care, I'm totally hooked on this place. I love their MILD sauce, I used to favor the tzatziki on my chicken souvlaki but then I tried the mild sauce and it was over! I've been loving my mild sauce ever since!! The chicken Gyro is GREAT!!! Everything I've ever had here has been good...but I must point out that I always order pretty much the same thing...the Gyro sandwich, the Gyro Burger or the Chicken Souvlaki plate. The St-Catherine location is opened late, so it's the perfect cure for that hangover. Can't wait to go back for my next Mild sauce fix! They should bottle that mild sauce and sell it, I'd buy it by the case and bring it back home with me!"}
{"text":"Kojax is a local Greek fast-food joint with a few stores around Montreal. The one on Ste-Catherine's is a great place to grab some real good eats and get it done FAST. All the usual standards of Greek fast food are there, but they also adapted Poutine and done it with gusto. Thick meaty gravy on those really thick cut Greek fried potatoes and delicious cheese that is brick in your stomach delicious; don't let its size fool you, it's a hill that feeds like a mountain. Service is speedy and I mean speedy, don't fear the line up, you'll be in and out of there before you know it. Seating is a little tight for the spatially challenged, but the place is clean and maintained. Grubilicious."}
{"text":"I will elaborate on what my favourite things are at Kojax another time. Nah, let me tell you now;  The Kojax Burger with mild sauce and some super heated fries (uniquely shaped puffy wedges - I like the crispy little ones best). The rice with peas and diced carrots is nice for a change and very filling. Add an orange julep drink if you feel like parting with extra charge.   That being said the real reason, I wanted to write this is to shout out the friendlier than average counter servers at this location. Perhaps, it's because they get a lot of tourists coming in pre or post game or show. It's also nice that they have hockey or local sports on TV."}
{"text":"I've tried many of their locations. Of all of them and the Kojax Burgers I've eaten, this one made an impression. It was layered extra high on the bun with mild sauce, lettuce and tomato. I don't want to sound like a Kojax Burger fanboy, but again the well seasoned gyro meat seemed to be sliced thicker and piled higher. Happily it did not leap over the counter onto the tray in a single bound.  Was nice to get that value (after all the prices have gone up since I first tried them years ago)."}
{"text":"Nourriture de moins en moins fraiche. La qualité et la fraicheur des legumes sont grandement a la baisse"}
{"text":"First time here even though I've been in Montreal a few times. The staff was great. They waved us in and talked us through what to order based on what we wanted. The food was quick but delicious. The combination of the staff, food, and drink was a success.   I got chicken skewers, geek salad, and poutine it hit the spot! So glad we happened to stumble upon this place. It will definitely be a night to remember and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Kojax has alot of history with me and has saved me from many a hangover when in Montreal. Their food has kept me fueled between bohemian Bar Hopping nights chasing French Canadian Women.  The souvlakis here are nowhere near the quality of say Arahova or Villa, but Kojax fills a niche of providing really fast Greek food with the emphasis on fast, to keep you fueled between bars or after a late weekday night out when you need to get to bed. In most other major Cities I think your only other alternative would be picking up a Pizza Slice or hotdog. I like the sweet sauce on mine when still hitting the town in consideration of breath. At the end of the night I'll take mixture of garlic and aforementioned hot sauce."}
{"text":"Kojax est un excellent resto grec que je recommande fortement, c'est le meilleur des restos  grecs, tout est excellent ainsi que les desserts! Le service est rapide et nous sommes toujours accueillis avec courtoisie!"}
