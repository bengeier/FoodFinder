{"text":"We were at nearby high park and wanted food nearby. Stumbled on Sparrow. We got in just after brunch had ended on a Sunday so we had he \"Snacks\" menu -- which has poutine, fries, charcuterie, etc. Price ranges around $6-$15 for snacks 

Got the Assorted Pickles plate and the Fries. For $6, we got a decent amount of fries. Enough for two people to split. Comes with ketchup and mayo--which I think were made in house. They tasted like it. Loved the mayo.

The Assorted Pickles plate is pretty good. Several pickled veggies (pear/apple?, cauliflower, garlic) as well as actual pickles.

The beer menu wasn't very large and was on the more pricey side ($7 and up). Felt it was overpriced for the selection.

I feel like we didn't hit this place at a great time so I feel biased, I bet brunch is better. But a satisfying spot. 

A surprise: Cool bathrooms downstairs!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when dr generosity closed but was delighted with my eggs benny, homemade biscuits were delicious. Hash with kimchi was fantastic. Nice surprise! Acidic side pear salad just didn't go with the eggs and left you wanting potatoes or something...or I would have given a full five stars."}
{"text":"We came here with high expectations based off of other reviews and the menu. When we walked in we waited a minute or two and then asked the bartender if we had to be seated or if we could sit anywhere, thinking it was more of a dinner place - he said we could sit anywhere. Shortly after the bartender came over to us with menus which only had drinks, and then promptly ignored us for the next 15 minutes, while continuing to tend to tables around us (including customers who came in after us). We finally purchased our drinks at the bar - the drinks were, in fact, very good! However, the service was very subpar; the bartender was inattentive, short, and curt. We would be willing to try again, but on a different night/at a different time."}
{"text":"La premiere chose qui saute aux yeux est la décoration du lieu. Un melange de rétro, bobo. La bibliothèque avec les livres aux grosses relieures rouges, la caisse enregistreuse qui émet un petit \"ding\" quand elle s'ouvre, le comptoir, la vaisselle style ancienne. Bref de ce côté là, cet endroit est une petite merveille.
Le personnel est aimable et accueillant. 
La carte n'est pas bien grande ce qui assure une bonne qualité et une fraîcheur des produits. Le plat de truitefumé sur pancakes et vraiment très bon et très copieux (alors qu'au premier coup d'oeil je me demandai si je n'allais pas rester sur ma faim...et bien non!). Les raisons pour lesquelles je n'ai pas mis 5 étoiles sont le prix qui est un peu élevé (16$ pour mon plat ce qui réduit l'envie de prendre un dessert ou une entrée) et le brouhaha ambiant (c'était un dimanche à 13h). Ce n'est pas vraiment vers chez moi mais je ne serai pas contre le fait d'y retourner."}
{"text":"I have had few meals in my life that were this satisfying.  I don't know if I was just in the mood for a good brunch at the time, or if this establishment is just THAT amazing! Everything from the decor to the food and service was exceptional.  Thanks to Yelp, this was a great find.  Although it is located off the beaten path for many, I suggest taking the hike to get there.  I certainly am glad I did.  The menu items are unique and they have something for any mood you may be in.  Great variety! I wish I had someplace like this I knew about at home."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks, but the bartenders have been, for the most part, very nice. Service has been pretty quick, even when they are super busy. I just wish they had a better whisky selection."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a table but we were able to enjoy our coffee while waiting, sitting in the stairs in the back. The service was good and the bacon was crispy. Great way to start a Sunday."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in the city hands down. When I used to live in Montreal, i came here all the time. Everytime, i visit i make it a point to come here. Why? The beer selection is great, the service staff are awesome and they play some of the most cutting edge awesome music from a variety of genres. This is one of the places that make me want to move back to Montreal every day!"}
{"text":"Sparrow brunch is AMAZING! 

Everything on the menu is good but the House-Smoked Trout with spinach & green onion pancake, soft boiled egg, beet salad & whipped crème fraiche is fantastic! To find out more, check out my article https://delifeed.ca/2016/03/05/plateau-mile-end-brunch-spots-for-all-kinds-of-brunchers/"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Friday night drinks, which were delicious.  It was comfortably busy (around 11pm had to wait ~5 mins for a table to leave) and we really enjoyed the atmosphere.  I'll be returning to continue my exploration of their extensive cocktail menu... Rumour has it their brunch is something special as well"}
{"text":"Not as good as I thought! Maybe I had high expectations. I ordered the Neptune and was not bad but did not blow me away! Go a bit down the street to Lawrence! Much better choice !"}
{"text":"Style bobo-hipster, deco vieillot et menu original! Attention par contre, ils ne prennent pas interac ni crédit donc prévoir le tout 
ca$h !"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant worth talking about in Bloor West Village.  
Even better that it's taken over the old Dr. Generosity spot (owner at Dr. Gens did not have a clue about customer service).  Anyway, there are some good restaurants in BWV but nothing that's ever stood out or compared to some of the great restaurants in Toronto.

Scallops, Zucchini blossoms, Fried Chicken, Duck breast, desserts all were beautiful put together and delighted the palates.  Menu was clear about approximate size of portions unlike other Euro /tapas style places we've been.

Service was great, introduced herself, and called us by name once we introduced ourselves.  We live in the area and love BWV.
Music added to the atmosphere with Ragtime/New Orleans Jazz!
We plan to do brunch and another dinner here very soon.  

Give it a try if you're up for a cozy nice place.

Sparrow IS upscale but they tell you that, so you will be paying a premium.  But we believe it is worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely well balanced drinks. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food since we went for cocktails only but the menu looks charming. The atmosphere is very chill. Try to get a spot on the couch when the windows are open."}
{"text":"This super relaxed restaurant/pub is pretty cool and BUSY - Yuppie central!!! The food was pretty incredible (had the ShaShuka) BUT the latte was a bit of disappointment (three mouthfuls and it was gone). Service was really good considering just how busy it was. Totally would recommend Sparrow but bring your own bowl or mug for latte! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and while it was packed, it didn't take that long to be seated- and immediately we were served coffee and water, which was nice (as it was a chilly day and we needed a warm beverage to warm up). And the food? AMAZING! I still think back to it sometimes! And will definitely visit again when I am in town next time!"}
{"text":"Quaint place with open windows, comfortable seating, and friendly staff.  Small menu but nice variety.   Went at 10am on a Saturday.  Made reservation through email the night before and they were wonderful in responding the night before.  Food was great!  Had the buckwheat pancakes and my friend had the egg sandwich special.    Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a Saturday morning brunch at 10:00AM. We arrived early, and waited outside, but the restaurant never opened! Several other groups were waiting outside until almost 11:00 when we gave up. Some people called with no answer, there was no sign, and no notice that brunch would not be served. At least put up a sign! 

There is now a message on their facebook that they will not be serving brunch until August 1."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé leur brunch du dimanche. L'ambiance est bien francophone, les gens font la queue et moi je l'ai réservé avant qq jours par E-Mail. Tout est bon, j'adore le gâteau de bluet."}
{"text":"Very cool resto in Bloor West Village. The sharing plates seem small but you realise after four courses that you've consumed a feast. The flank steak is one of the best things I've ever eaten!
Be sure to save room for dessert, the dishes are unique and creative... Not to mention delicious."}
{"text":"I Went there for brunch with my girl. She had the Shakshuka or should I say we had, because I was all over her plate . The sauce was just delicious and tasty. I ordered the sandwich Za'atar with merguez, it's a very generous plate with chopped potatoes,I brought the rest home.Definitely a good price value.

The staff was  kind  and effective, it's was my second time at Sparrow, and clearly not the last.

Oh ! Almost forgot  please try the honey ginger lemonade, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Someone local recommended Sparrow to us as we are visiting the Bloor West Village for the first time. It is a gem!! Staff recommended the daily special.. An oyster tasting plate. It was awesome,  especially the accompanying raspberry minionette.  We shared the little gems,  their version of a Caesar salad,  with delicious quail egg. Next we shared the flank steak which was done to perfection. Large portion... 16oz is designed for sharing. It was served over charred cream corn. It had a flavorful chimichurri sauce with flavors from chilies, coriander and cocoa nibs. We also shared the the mushroom tartine , which was a great accompaniment to the steak. No room for dessert although we heard it is delicious. Next time. 

We wish we had a place like this back home! Cool decor."}
{"text":"I would actually be giving 3.5/5 stars if I could, but I'll bump them up .5 stars because out of the 3 or so times I've been, they've been mostly good rather than not. 

The food has always been pretty delicious -- oysters, charcuterie, tartare, chicken wings, fries -- all really solid quality. 

Price-wise, it's on par with what you'd find in the downtown core, which is a bit disappointing considering rent MUST be cheaper over here in Bloor West Village/Etobicoke. 

BUT that's mostly made up for by the service, because it's almost always been great, and count on the fact that you'll never deal with hipster-restaurant-lineups here. 

The Nest also just opened up recently, which is an awesome more loungey, bar-like atmosphere upstairs (owned by the same people), with a giant flatscreen playing sports, comfy seats and most importantly BOARD GAMES. It's such a nice comfy not-loud place to relax on the weekend. 

One thing that happened today that was pretty unacceptable (especially because my boyfriend and I LOVE cocktails and by now, know our shit when it comes to good cocktails): the girl bartender made me a negroni that was ONE OUNCE. She put in 1/3 of each of the ingredients of a negroni. Fine fine, if she was going to: a) charge me a lot less or, b) acknowledge her mistake after we politely asked her to clarify how she made her negronis. But no, she was really, really rude to us and after we corrected her (us: actually, negronis ARE 3 oz. drinks, or at least 2.5 oz, and most definitely NOT 1 oz. drinks), she basically ignored us. It put a damper on what was a great night until then. 

Anyway, we spoke to the manager or owner, and he was super awesome about it and promised that wouldn't happen again (and assured us his negronis were 2.5 to 3 oz, of course), so that's that. But hey, a lesson for bartenders who don't actually know their shit: don't act like you automatically know more than the customer when in fact you do NOT. And most definitely don't be rude to us for pointing out your errors. 

Bartender aside, we still plan to go back :) the server we had while eating downstairs at The Sparrow was AWESOME and we live in the area, so it's still on our list!"}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe, great location, bad service.

Went there for a birthday brunch on a Saturday, we (group of 7) didn't mind the 30 minutes wait to get a table. Beside sitting on highly uncomfortable low stools we were looking forward to get our foody on and ordered all different plates. ufs à la sauge, buckweat pancakes, granola yogurt, steak and eggs, ice tea, home made OJ and 2 of us ordered their famous donuts. 
They have 3 flavors available:
Nutella
Peanut butter and jam
And Lemon.

My friend ordered 3 Nutella ( they come as serve of 3) and my other friend ordered the mixed 3 which is one of each flavors.

So, I was amazed, we were a group and the waitress took zero note. We waited a long time, and the ice tea was forgotten, the OJs were tiny and the donuts: my friend who ordered the mixed ones got 3 lemons, the one who ordered 3 Nutella got the mixed ones. So clearly the Nutella was mixed up  and they gave us lemons and then the waitress got mixed up on who ordered what so we politely told her and showed her it was yellow lemon cream ( delicious by the way but oh so lemons) and she started to argue with us that she was gonna credit these but that the order was right and that we ordered jam and the lemons were jam! We were like \"are u effing kidding me\" ?! To make a mistake is fine but don't Bs us ! 

Other then the rudest waitress ever who wouldn't admit a mistake like EVER, the food was delicious, live up to expectations, and everybody LOVE what they ate. Cool hipster place, we will be back (and will have a different waitress . When life gives you lemons you make lemonade..! ;)"}
{"text":"I went to the Sparrow for brunch with my boyfriend based on the reviews on Yelp and we weren´t disappointed. We didn´t have a reservation, but got a table right away (if you´re coming with more than two people, you should make a reservation).

We had the Turkish breakfast, the pancakes and shared the PB & Jelly Donouts - it was great!! The service was really nice and I´ll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good brunch in a very hip area. Food was the highlight with service falling a close second.

-Lamb Kefta burger ($14): note this was a Saturday brunch special so not sure if it's always available. The burger was small... BUT AMAZING. Lamb was very succulent with a fried egg in top which gave me the largest grin known to man

-Shakshuka with mergez sausages ($13 +$2 for sausages): decent sausages and poached egg. Sauce was the highlight. 

Overall, nice service and great food. I definitely wanted more."}
{"text":"A great place to have a delicious lunch in the mile end.
The staff is great, the decor is very tasteful.

a bit on the slow side, but I had no desire to leave the place so it was ok."}
{"text":"Bonne musique pour prendre un verre le soir, légèrement Hipster... Les plats passent et même si je n'y suis pas pour manger, ça à l'air très tentant..."}
{"text":"came here for dinner on a quiet tuesday night, while on a brief trip to montreal. as it was a weekday, the pace was slow but the place was far from empty. we had an excellent waitress that recommended the devil's backbone (prunes stuffed w a fruit wrapped in bacon and topped with a sweet glaze) for an appetizer which was enjoyable and quite sweet. our entrees were the steak with potatoes and pan seared trout. the steak was ok but potatoes were well-seasoned and the trout was delicious as were the sides of cauliflower, rice and something else. 

short version: great service, reasonable price, great atmosphere and tasty entrees."}
{"text":"Nous étions bien excités d'essayer ce resto pour le brunch...
Nous arrivons devant la porte à 10h45 (ouverture à 10h); tout est fermé. Aucune affiche sur la porte ne disant que c'est fermé. Aucun avis sur leur boîte vocale. Aucune mention sur leur site Web. Aucune mention sur leur page Facebook. Rien.
C'est inacceptable et non professionnel, surtout que nous nous sommes déplacés expressément pour ce resto.
Dommage..."}
{"text":"The watermelon mimosas were awesome, fresh and perfect for brunch. They are really small though. But still great! My partner had the bourbon lemonade and he said that was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I wish we found this place at the beginning of our vacation and not at the end. 

Our bartender ... Ben or Brian? was awesome. Told us all about the town which was helpful.

Their cocktail menu is almost exclusively classic cocktails and they all come with one low price, $8.70 Canadian. Which is nuts because one of their base spirits was Glenlivet Scotch and another had Green Chartreuse in it. For a dollar, you can upgrade your base spirit as well.

We didn't try any of their food, but man, their cocktails are great. And it's a cute little spot! If you need an amazing cheap cocktail, this is the place."}
{"text":"-they are open late
-good location, around 20m walk from busy club area
-sitting on the couch, by the open window, very relax.
-friendly service, they make you the most comfortable."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or just to have a drink and hang out on a rainy day. The borcsht is really good and so is the roast pork sandwich. Try the polenta fries! Its like a cross between french fries and cheese puffs."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday morning. Hostess and waitress very friendly and professional. Ordered the frittata and the stuffed french toast, both were amazing. Service was quick but not rushed, which was great. The atmosphere was nice and cozy on a frigid morning. Will definitely be back to try the lunch and dinner menus!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place on st laurent that we visited for brunch.  It is cozy and was packed on Sunday at noon. We waited 35 minutes for two spots at the bar, but enjoyed a great coffee and crumpets while we waited. Really really good quality coffee. 

The brunch selection is good but small, with plenty of English delights for those who seek a greasy spoon (am I using that correctly?). I had baked eggs, which were great, and my husband had the florentine, which he enjoyed but didnt consider amazing. Each dish was about $14.  The atmosphere was very comfortable and friendly.  

I really like the place, and would love to go back."}
{"text":"Brutal in every way. Service was inattentive. Had to seat ourselves and get their attention. Got the burger and partner got the grilled cheese. I was asked how I wanted the burger done, I said medium rare, and what I got was the most well done, dry burger I ha ever had. Every single bite had to be washed down with beer. Accompanying salad had a little bit of oil only as 'dressing'.

My partner's grilled cheese was the most basic grilled cheese anyone has ever made, and the fries weren't seasoned.

Brutal!"}
{"text":"Incredible polenta fries, Outstanding (but $8) basil gimlets, old-fashioned drinks, new-fashioned crowd, cute and sweet staff - this is a great spot for people watching, meeting friends for drinks and eating yummy edibles. 
a fairly artsy crowd with a chill staring-at-you-but-don't-appear-to-be-staring-at-you vibe."}
{"text":"i have been going on and off since it opened. sometimes it is ok and other times it isn't. i went last night for birthday drinks and sat at the uncrowded bar for 10 minutes while the bartender ignored my wife and i. so we left and called my friends who were meeting us there and went somewhere else. 

they have no 5 a 7, the drinks are pricey, the clientele is a mostly hipster too cool for school crowd. it is cozy and nicely decorated inside though. the soundtrack is what you would expect from montreals mile end.  

such a shame, i want to like this place but it just reeks of insecurity and insincerity."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is cause the service is meh. I always get the same girl and she is isn't very friendly!!! Not a good look for a waitress at an otherwise lovely bar/restaurant. Oysters are always lovely and fresh, but if you like them spicy ask for hot sauce when you order!! The salads and huge and amazing, the grilled cheese...to die for, channa masala..tasty! Drinks? Top notch and the bartenders are usually pretty hot"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had fantastic drinks and french fries. They offer a full bar with all the trimmings. I feel confident the bartenders could expertly make just about any drink. The bartender and owner chatted with us. We would have gone back if our hotel was closer."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it was still Dr Generosity's. I was sadly disappointed. So sad.

Our waiter was a very nice young man, and he was obviously not properly trained, seemed nervous and made far too many mistakes. Did not know prices or ingredients (ie, the baked beans are not vegetarian). The menu had prices for some things but not everything. Pretentious or bad proofreading?

I ordered a smoothie to start. It was a green smoothie with kale, peaches, ginger, etc. My hubs ordered a dill pickle caesar with extra pickles. His caesar came about 10 mins later with zero pickles, and no smoothie. He inquired about the pickles and smoothie and 10 mins later 3 slices of pickles arrived, 5 mins later a beige smoothie appeared. I took a sip to find it had no gingery zing, it obviously had no kale in it, and it had pineapple (I'm allergic) in it. I sent it back, and he came back with in with the promise there was no pineapple in it and they had ran out of kale, which is why it was not green. \"I hope that is ok\". I sent it away and just stuck with water. 

4 of our friends have arrived by this time and placed a few drink orders. Frazzled, the waiter went away and came back 2x to re-confirm the drink orders. The drinks eventually came. 

The waiter recommended the cured salmon salad to our vegetarian friends. What? After a 20 min wait the meals came out. Small portions borderline tapas, which I am fine with, but be aware, heavy eaters will not be satisfied. The meal was fairly tasty - there were missing ingredients in most of our meals. I am pretty sure my grilled cheese was suppose to come with icing sugar and maple something, but instead it was sprinkled with ash - a server gave some weird explanation about the history of morbier and ash, whatever. I brushed the (cig?) ash aside and finished eating. 

The staff (managers? owners?) we're having all sorts of conversations and walking back and forth from the front to the back of the restaurant. 

The bill came. We presented our AMEX which he swiped unknowingly that this establishment did not take AMEX. We paid cash. 

The dinner menu looked pretty interesting. But I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"This is like the bar that people from Blizzarts age into in their late 20s. Super chill vibe in the summer when the front is open. Loved the huge couches and the chill vibe with a DJ. Great drinks available for a bargain ~$8. Would definitely come back on a laid back Montreal night. Was decently populated but not bursting at the seams when I went on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Good cocktails! Chill space. Loved the basil gimlet and the sazerac. Good deal on raw oysters too! Sat at the bar, and bartender was awesome. Good place! Will come again to actually have dinner!"}
{"text":"In a neighborhood that is rapidly becoming unaffordable Sparrow is a welcome change from it's predecessor. The new decor is a refreshing change of pace - cleaner and more elegant than the prior space - while keeping accessibility and family friendly practices in mind. 

Of course, it doesn't hurt that the scallops are buttery perfection (especially when paired with a spicy sharp chorizo, snappy Jerusalem artichoke chips and a verdant pea puree), or that the salads pair bittersweet grapefruit with tender watercress & crisp fennel in a clean, well balanced way, or that the tender forest mushrooms blanketed in breadcrumbs and a judicious amount of Parmesan benefit from a luxurious veal jus bath. 

Stay for dessert if you can. It's worth lingering over - especially for the classic rock soundtrack!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful! I loved the Bahmi breaky sandwich. However, the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Great brunch, good dinner. Brunch is the best of your classics with additional delicious smoothies and coffee. 

Dinner is more of a tapas style of ordering, good food but a little too pricey for what you get. We had a half dozen oysters, beef tartar, scallops (unbelievable), and the barrada (cheese) salad with two glasses of vino. Everything was tasty, but in the end we paid $100 and were still hungry. 

Overall, great service and we will be back for brunch. Very gluten free friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a drink with friends at Sparrow and really loved the atmosphere and service. 

I also appreciate that they haven't overstuffed the bar with tables to maximize the potential monetary gain, sacrificing ambiance. It is a bar that is roomy and easy to chat with friends in. 

Can't wait to go back and try their food."}
{"text":"Went for 1/2 price mussels night, 7$ for a large bowl of mussels and frites. They were Great! Maybe one of My favorites since coming to the city. I will make a point to come back just for these. My boyfriend had the steak, and said it was good, maybe just overpriced for what it was. 
As great as those were, the grilled romaine was terrible and flavorless though (salt please!).  The service was great, food came out quickly, and there were some other interesting items I'd look forward to trying. I'll be back... Just not for the romaine."}
{"text":"I always come to sparrow when I am in Montreal for brunch. The place has a great vibe and delicious food. The carrot, beat and apple juice that they press there is really nice. I usually order the Shakshuka which has incredible flavour and is a nice twist on an egg breakfast."}
{"text":"Sparrow was disappointing.
I came here for brunch with a friend while on vacation. We arrived fifteen minutes before our reservation and upon walking in to an empty restaurant were curtly told \"we're not open.\" Better restaurants would have invited us to sit down inside with a glass of water while we waited for them to open. Instead, we waited outside on a bench in front of a nearby store in the wind. I guess they feel it helps their hipster cred to have people \"line up\" outside the restaurant five minutes before 10. I think it's just poor customer service.
When we were finally allowed inside I was struck by how over-the-top hipster the decor was, it was basically like eating in an urban outfitters store. It was also very strange how uninteresting most of the menu items seemed to me -- I am a brunch fanatic so I usually find at least a few things appealing on even mediocre brunch menus. I ended up choosing a salmon dish with cream fraiche and spinach pancakes.  The dish was okay, but I was thrown off by the strange, strong spice in the pancakes (some sort of curry maybe?), which was completely incongruent to the other flavors in the dish and jarring. 
I also consider it poor service that we had to continually ask for water refills."}
{"text":"Cute spot for a cocktail in Montreal! I got the basil gimlet which was refreshing and not too sweet. We didn't get food but it smelled delicious too from the tables around us. Also loved the wallpaper - Montreal does wallpaper well."}
{"text":"Cool place to go. Good service. Very casual and trendy. The menu is not that big for brunch, I would had liked to have more options or a little bit more of variety. Other than that, we enjoyed our time there for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved our brunch here!

I had the eggs benedict which included poach eggs, asparagus, and hollandaise on homemade biscuits. And it was served with homemade tater tots. Amazing!  The biscuits were deliciously light, the sauce was yummy and the eggs were perfect. 

My husband had the huevos rancheros and a side of tots. Both were fabulous. Everything is housemade which is nice. 

Great stop for brunch.  Thanks yelpers for pointing us here."}
{"text":"10/10 brunch from a disillusioned Ontarian who used to wait hour long at establishments in Chicago. So this place was excellent not because the dishes were complicated or different (why eat a breakfast dish you could make yourself?) but the combination of ingredients are unique, inventive and the flavours are layered. I got a smoked trout dish. The trout came as a rosette on top of a savory chopped parsley potato cake. Also came with sour cream and a side of beet and quince salad. Though I was tempted by the cardomom latte and blood orange mimosa I just had to have a savoury cocktail. My Bloody Mary was perfect; the sourness and saltiness seemed to balance with the spiciness. Might I add, the olive, pickle-lette and marinated cauliflower that came on the pick tasted addictive. Ugh it was just so good"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! We were so impressed with the menu, service, and atmosphere. 10/10 would return!"}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere, solid food, mediocre drinks. I would come back but certainly not the top of my list."}
{"text":"Went on a pre-midnight adventure here in early Spring. Very well-curated drink list, requisite pseudo-salvage lounge eclectic decor. Food was \"meh\" which is what prevented a four star rating. \"meh\" is code for inattentive cooking e.g. over-fried frites, etc. 

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't expect brunch to be great here! It got super busy really quickly, so make sure you make a reservation. They only take reservations when they open at 10am on the weekends. Their menu isn't your standard brunch so you should come here if you want a change from the typical eggs and sausage scene. I got the smoked salmon pancake dish and it was really good. It didn't live up to my expectations since the other yelp reviews hyped it up too much for me. The smoked salmon was fresh and their beet salad is amazing. I could have just sat there and ate their beet salad for hours. Coffee was unlimited which was a plus!"}
{"text":"Je suis venue pour boire un coup avec deux amis et nous avons vraiment passé un bon moment. Le bloody ceasar est excellent et nous avons commandé différents snacks du menu qui étaient délicieux (calamars, pruneaux au bacon et foies de volaille). J'ai trouvé les prix raisonnable et le service efficace, nous reviendrons !"}
{"text":"Super Hip place. The drinks are pretty hit or miss depending on the drink and the bartender at the time. My friends and I had some pretty mild drinks the first 2 rounds, then the bartenders switched and whooo they got real strong real fast. Ambiance is pretty cool though. I didn't try their food, so just so you guys know this is strictly a review of their drink menu."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch menu, all ingredients are fresh and cooked perfectly. We ordered the fried Eggs with sage, buckwheat pancakes, shakshouka and banh mi sandwich. Fully recommended!"}
{"text":"Another reviewer called The Sparrow a \"British gastropub\" and I think it's an apt description. High-quality pub food with an Indian twist (like a real pub in England, not like the usual British pub in North America) at very reasonable prices.

My regret is going there for after-dinner drinks, and therefore not being hungry enough for the \"real food\" on the menu. I was there with a group of Yelpers and we snacked on fries (from real potatoes, with the skins on) served with AMAZING  homemade ketchup and homemade mayo, and hot, crispy polenta fries. 

My basil gimlet (gin, lime, fresh basil) was fab. Will have to try to reproduce this one at home.

The atmosphere was \"funky old mansion\" with full bookcases, black-and-white portaits on the walls, and a tin ceiling.

I will definitely be coming back with my dear husband for another crack at the menu. I've heard it's very popular at brunch. It might be an excellent warming-up spot during the Christmas market at a nearby park (St-Laurent & Laurier)."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his mom once and she ordered a burger to split with my boyfriend, along with polenta fries, mussels and regular fries. Oh yeah, we also had onion bahjis to start. 
Well, it wasn't enough for my mother in law because behind our backs, she went and ordered another burger. Which she ate. By herself. 

If I just told this story, and you believed this non-fiction tale (trust me, I am a witness and was there), then you too should go to Sparrow and stuff your face with all of their deliciousness. It will reach the deepest depths of all your arteries and you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Cute decor: check; amazing food: check; great coffee: hell yeah. Sparrow knows how to serve you the full breakfast experience with excellence. Me and my friend had the shakshuka which was beautifully served and was full of flavour. Their filter coffee was so good that I craved it all day.

The only problem today was that they forgot our donuts so we waited almost an hour for them but then they compensated by giving them to us for free. 

Great place, can't wait to come back again honestly."}
{"text":"Such a great brunch! We were worried there might not be enough food given some of the pictures shown here, but it was plenty. Quiet and casual, we would recommend for anyone looking for a good brunch spot."}
{"text":"This review is just for the cocktails. They are superb. I had the best gin and tonic of my life, and that is saying A LOT. All the other cocktails I tasted are well balanced and delicious, too. Prices are very reasonable for what you get, and the ambiance and environment is comfortable for either meeting up with friends or as a date spot."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a brunch place that neither of us had been to. We decided to go to sparrow eventually. The environment was great. I especially liked the sparrow logo that appeared basically everywhere. They do not have a huge list of food there, but all the people seemed to enjoy the food. I ordered fried eggs with sage, which was awesome. The baked tomato was the best tomato I've ever had. One only thing was that since there were people waiting, the waitress kind of pushing us to leave even though my friend and I were still talking."}
{"text":"The place looks nice. I had the shakshouka. It was good but the bread was too toasted. My friends had the banh mi sandwich. It was also alright but a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one weekend. It's a charming, cozy spot in the Plateau, and as with all good brunch spots in city, you'll have in wait in a long queue if you come late in the morning. The wait is beyond worth it. We ordered the buckwheat pancakes and the breakfast banh-mi - both were so so good (and Instagram-worthy). Crowd was mixed with locals and students. Definitely have to come back one night for drinks!"}
{"text":"Un excellent spot pour dej à MTL . J'ai mangé de la truite fumée sur une pancake au epinard et c'etait tout simplement divin  nous avons mangé au bar, car il y avait beaucoup de monde, mais nous avons bien aimé notre experience !

Nous avons entendu dire qu'il y a un salon de the aussi en haut ! Nous allons surement l'essayer bientot aussi !"}
{"text":"The Sparrow is adorable and I simply LOVE. IT. The store front doesn't say \"The Sparrow or Le Moineau\" instead there's a picture of a sparrow. Drawn to its aesthetics, my friends and I walked into this dimly lit, dark wood furniture joint (wooden tables, chairs, bookcases with books in French! Simply classy and extremely hipster-y.

Anyway, we stumbled upon this place because we wanted to check out some local bars and have a place to hang out... and I think we hit jackpot (at least for our personalities, we were looking for cool, hipster-y hangout with not too many people). We were able to play a game of Jenga thanks to the bar (I guess they offer some board games?) As for drinks, my favorite drink of the night was the dark and stormy! It was the perfect blend of rum and ginger beer... très délicieux! 

Although it was a Sunday night, the place wasn't completely deserted, it had the right amount of people. The crowd consist of young twenty something hipster-y looking people.. some of which can be young professionals or mature college kids who are able to engage in some intellectually stimulating and witty conversations. 

Bottom line: I loved this place and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Lively small place with a great bunch vibe. Lots of people waiting for your table.

[ My Order ] : Smoked Trout + PB&J Donuts

Smoked trout was good, but the leek/scallion pancake just overpowered my tastebuds with cumin. I felt like every meal after that was just kind of an aftertaste of cumin/jacked-up spices. The creme fraiche helped, but I had such a small spoonful that ultimately, I didn't even finish my plates. Comes with beets, they were good.

PB & J Donuts had no jam in them. I was jelly that there was no jam here."}
{"text":"The bar is easily accessible but is located in a busy neighbourhood and parking is difficult. We had drinks and some friends ordered food. There were few nice options on the drink menu but overall the variety was good. The food was oriental style and had a nice combination of spices.   Interior design is nice and you feel very comfortable. Ceiling is high and thus high noise level does not give you headache. Unfortunately the second floor is not available and they said it belongs to another business."}
{"text":"This place was great. Loved the decor and the vibe. We showed up at 10:30am on a Sunday and there was only space at the bar available but that was fine with us. The chairs were comfortable and there was plenty of room. They have sparrow wallpaper and a great stained glass sparrow. And sparrows on the coasters.

I had the smoked trout dish that included scallion pancakes, beets and soft boiled eggs and was AMAZING!! I loved it. My friend for the buckwheat pancakes with bacon and also loved it. We didn't have any drinks but the lattes were good.

It's also in a nice area with tons of great shops nearby."}
{"text":"Will definitely return!! Not a fan of venison though but everything we ordered was amazing."}
{"text":"Yikes - want to like this place so badly because I live in the neighborhood but it's just very average!

We came in for brunch.  Maybe their specialty is dinner.

Friendly service, menu is decent, food is average but it ends there.  The décor confuses me.  Exterior vs Interior. Which crowd are you trying to appeal to?  Again, maybe it's more obvious what this place is about during dinner service.

Ordered the traditional breakfast.  Everything was decent.  Asked for ketchup and was told there would be a charge for the special home made tomato sauce.  No thanks - I will take the Heinz.  If you want to appeal to fancy schmancy brunchers and stand out on your \"traditional breakfast\" dish - throw in a spoonful of this tomato sauce so there is something worth talking about."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The following review is for Sparrow / Le Moineau in the Plateau and it is very much open. 

I think I'd been here years ago for drinks at night, but this was my first time brunching at Sparrow. A savoury brunch for two. This is a charming yuppie brunch - everything is pleasant and rustically refined with pops of whimsy. 

A nice reminder of some past summer travels, I opted for the turkish breakfast: olives, feta, eggs, walnuts, apricots, veggies, flatbread, sour cherry jam, fig jam and merguez sausage on the side. Visually appealing and good for people who like to pick on a little of this and bit of that. Nothing too standout in terms of taste. It makes a great photograph for all you IG/Yelp types!

Likely to appease me (I had mentioned that this dish looked great), my fellow bruncher got a near perfect savoury dish with hints of sweetness that consisted of house smoked trout with spinach and green onion pancake, beet salad, soft boiled egg and whipped creme fraiche. I preferred this dish and we shared both plates. 

I wouldn't wait in line for this (and thankfully we didn't) but I would recommend it if you're looking for a solid brunch spot in the mile end.

This is a bar and so definitely order some boozy brunch cocktails while you're at it!

Correct Yelp listing: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/sparrow-le-moineau-montréal Chirp derp."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side for breakfast / brunch but you get what you paid for. Salmon and scrambled eggs are fantastic, as is the English breakfast. 

I like places with revolving menus, and even the mainstays are great - excellent burger and even better fries make this a must-visit. Just wish they were open more often and with more regular hours. Also the long wait, strange reservation rules, and cash-only payment make this 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Service was fast, food was delicious and reasonably priced. It's a very popular spot but we didn't have to wait long to be seated however we had to sit at the end of the bar. Most staff were very friendly and made us feel welcomed and not rushed even though it was clearly very busy!
Best brunch I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I was here for a brunch on a Saturday, had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn't hat bad. The staffs were very friendly, We started off with three mini donuts, which was amazing (especially pb&j flavor and this is coming from a person who doesn't like pb&j usually) and Basil Gimlet cocktail was a top notch!! Their breakfast banh-mi was delightful. A must go place if you are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great bar for cocktails and nightcaps with friends. Service can be slow if they're busy..."}
{"text":"Good food, but not outstanding. I tried the lamb kefta burger. It was pretty salty, and the meat was dense. The potatoes on the side were average.

Ambiance was nice, but not much space to wait. A bunch of us were told to sit on a staircase to wait for a table, and we kept having to move out of the way of people who wanted to use the staircase."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, around the corner from Olimpico. Street parking only.

The place: Loved the decor and the funky wallpaper. To me, the place was a cross between country meets British pub. Good vibrations all around. 

The food: Back in March or April, one of the staff told me a new chef would be taking over. When I took a look at the menu yesterday, I felt that the choices were limited - there were maybe 5-6 options. Gone were the Red Velvet waffles and no Polenta fries in sight. Anyway, I decided to go with the fried eggs with sage, roasted potatoes, bacon and sourdough toast, served on a board, a skillet for my eggs and all. It was a good breakfast - the eggs were tasty, though I couldn't taste the sage. The potatoes were perfectly roasted, if lacking in flavour, the bacon was super thin which I like, but a bit too oily for me. The bread was fresh as can be and damn good to boot. My date had the Turkish breakfast and it was OK but nothing to write home about. 

Service: Good. The only hiccup was when our food was brought to us. My date is allergic to gluten so when the waitress took our order, she offered a green salad as a substitute for the pancakes. No mention of extra costs. The person who brought our plates over gave my date attitude when she asked for the salad and started saying there would be an extra charge for this. She wasn't accommodating at all and frankly, a little rude. Pay attention when we try to explain why a substitute was requested, and that this was offered by your colleague. The person who took our order came to sort this out which we appreciated but I mean, a little common courtesy from the other chick would have been nice. It's not like one chooses to have Celiac disease. 

Price point: Pretty decent - my plate was about $10. However. Coffee wasn't included."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Sunday. It was an incredible experience. The presentation of the food is excellent. The service is great and the food is flavorful. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their dinner and having brunch there once more!"}
{"text":"Petit bar de renommée sur St Laurent, dans un cadre chaleureux avec lumières tamisées et déco à l'ancienne. Il y a des sofas, des banquettes et des chaises confos. On y va pour prendre un verre ou 2, manger des tapas ou des burgers, chiller entre collègues ou amis, et on y passe un bon moment à coup sûr! Le service est très bon, la bouffe aussi.. J'ai pris les calmars frits et c'était un vrai régal, avec quelques morceaux de pieuvre frite aussi!
A tester!"}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about this resto/bar so I decided to check it out with my friend one Sunday. The place itself is cute and cozy. We had to wait roughly 10 mins for our table, but the hostess was kind enough to offer us a coffee while we waited. 

We finally got a seat at the bar. We ordered the beet and carrot juice small format. Let's just say it was REALLY SMALL. It costed 5$. Total ripoff. I had to sip it slowly to make sure I could enjoy it with my meal. Let's just say I ended up drinking water with my meal, which I had to ask the busboy for because my waitress was too pretentious to serve us. Coffee isn't even included with your meal. It's is overly priced as well. 

I ordered the shashuka with merguez sausages. It was delicious but not satisfying.  I was still hungry after my meal. My friend ordered the Turkish breakfast which he seemed to really enjoy. 

For me, Sunday brunch is all about filling up your stomach to the brim with hearty food. This place just didn't cut it"}
{"text":"Relaxed, calm, old-school interior with dark woods, textured/patterned ceiling, nice comfy L-shaped couch near windows, small tables with plenty of space between them.

Only had a drink this visit: a basil gimlet.  Finely made.  Nice & basily.  Ice-cold.  The small cocktail menu is all $8.  Snacks and finer pub fare is available.

Attentive, kind, anglo-bartender.

Cash only.  ATM upstairs.

Will definitely be back for drinks and to try the food next time."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant along the Bloor strip. Decided to walk in for brunch today after discovering massive line ups at our usual spots. We sat right along the window which is great for a coffee and people watching. Server was friendly but not overly attentive. Ordered the pulled pork hash and was sadly disappointed. Portion size was good and potatoes were really tasty however just found the dish dry and a little bland. Wish I could say better things about this little cutie but unfortunately this place won't be added to the brunch hot spots."}
{"text":"I chose this for a surprise weekend date with my boyfriend. I knew it might be crowded and difficult to have a table, so I decided to go there early. When we showed up around 10 AM, a few tables were already seated. The dining room was pleasantly decorated with vintage and mismatched furniture (I spotted a church bench!), although slightly austere due to all the dark woodwork and sobriety.

We sat down close to the bar and reached for our menus. When I watch movies at home, I have the terrible habit of checking the plot summary on Internet - I just can't help it, the apprehension kills me. In a similar way, I can't help but to study a restaurant's menu carefully before going there. There's no more surprise, but there's a weird satisfaction in knowing exactly what one wants. So right away I ordered the House-Smoked Trout, and after some intense reflection, my boyfriend chose the Shakshuka. 

The food came as I was enjoying my classic Mimosa. The plates were absolutly gorgeous: the colors were rich, appetizing, and conveyed a warm sense of plenty. The first bites were simply scrumptious. The spinach and green onion pancakes were thick and buttery, the slices of smoked trout were thick and buttery, the generous dollop of cream was thick and buttery...
Needless to say that I started feeling overwhelmed halfway through the meal - thank goodness for the beets! My boyfriend obviously wasn't intimidated by his food in any way. He devoured his poached eggs and toast in a heartbeat.

It was quite a substantial - and delicious - start for our day!"}
{"text":"Probably the single worst breakfast experience ever. We unfortunately showed up with my father and elderly grandmother at the wrong time--we waited a very long time to be seated and only because the tables that could hold at least 4 people had people that kept ordering coffee/tea despite the fact that there was a long line outside. But we waited without saying a word except for maybe the occasional dirty look towards those that kept ordering beverages even thought they clearly saw that 10-15 people waiting at the door. The waitress finally seated us after 45min wait and then... she ordered the wrong meals for us... very weird. She felt awful credited the wrong plates. Anyway, stories like this is likely why everyone hates hipsters :p"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.
After reading all these great reviews I expected a decent brunch place, but the food was pretty  sub-par.

I had the lumberjack.
My pancakes were fine, the beans seemed to have come from a can - they were very mushy and tasteless, my eggs only had one intact yolk, the sausage was the best part but a pre-smoked sausage is hard to screw up. 
My hubby had Scotch eggs, they arrived raw on the inside, he found this out after taking a big bite...mmm, mmm raw pork...
They made him some new ones but he wasn't very pleased with those either because they decided against hard-boiled eggs for the center (weird decisions much?) and he found them really bland.

The apple juice they offered him was very good though, and my Bloody Caesar was also nice.

On top of that they do have really good service (Minus a 40+ minute wait on our food) , they communicated well with my husband and we didn't  have to pay for anything he consumed.
So not all is bad..."}
{"text":"I had had a very rough day before happening upon the Sparrow and boy was I ever glad that I chose to stop in! Top notch service, very friendly, and excellent drinks and food!

I sat at the bar and badly needed a drink or two, so I was happy to discover that the Sparrow had a decent variety and great selection! The food really won me over: I had the mussels and fries, absolutely delicious.

The space was recently renovated and it looks amazing! Think high end steam punk. Additionally, they have private washrooms for each guest downstairs. Brilliant concept! If you've ever been to the VIP Cineplex theatres, then you will know what to expect at the Sparrow. And they've just opened up a second floor with games and an even more fun atmosphere to boot!

Great experience, great food, great decor and ambiance, and fast, friendly service. If you don't stop in here, you don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Pour ce qui est de la déco, je suis totalement tombé sous le charme, bibliothèque avec les vieux livres à bordures rouges dorées etc, ça ressemble aux vieilles bibliothèques/salon de thé où la bourgeoisie se retrouvait à l'époque victorienne.

Ils proposent des brunchs, cafés, thés.

Ils ont aussi plusieurs cocktails et autres drinks, vraiment pas cher. Pour ma part j'en ai pris un à base d'Absinthe, je n'ai pas été déçu. 

Ils ont aussi une carte intéressante, pas mal de chose sont bonnes, mais dans le lots on a eu une surprise ... on a voulut goûté à la polenta frite et ben c'est vraiment gras, presque comme une éponge à huile.

D'où le 4/5.

J'aime cet endroit et j'y retournerai quand je reviendrai à Montréal."}
{"text":"The Sparrow is located in a hip and cool neighborhood. It has a hip and cool vibe. Also, everything is bird-related which is super cheesy and cute hihi. The presentation of the food is ridiculously cute and totally Instagram-worthy. However, the portions were pretty small and I was still hungry after my meal. The food itself was alright. It's a good place to go to if you want nice pictures."}
{"text":"I love the Sparrow, I have been here many a time, and drank many a drink. I hear the food is good, but I never tried it, it's really the atmosphere of this place that makes it such a popular place with the jetset scenesters and casual boat shoe wearing clientele alike. If you order a Jamieson's they give 4 for the price of 3, how thoughtful, and what will you be having?"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday  night. They had a shuck a buck special. Oysters were fresh and delicious. Service was attentive. I also ordered their smoked pork chop. Was very flavourful, just wish they had a little veggies on the plate. 

I've heard their brunch is really good, will try again next time in town."}
{"text":"Writing my first ever review because I couldn't find the contact info to deliver this directly to the owners. Went last night (Thursday) by myself for a little nightcap at the bar. Reasonably busy but bartender is ensconced at the other end deep into communion with his cell phone. I thought it strange but whatever. Then as the minutes passed and he continued to ignore me even as he got off his phone I started to get peeved. The fact that his colleague who serves the much busier floor tried to pick up his slack and even had to apologize in his stead only highlighted the fact that it IS a fact that this bartender needs to find himself another job or be retrained to view the world as not revolving around him. In short my pleasant walk in the frigid cold was ruined by ending up at the Sparrow rather than the gazillion other bars nearby with far superior bartenders."}
{"text":"There weren't many places I could call amazing in Montreal, but as far as breakfast goes, this place helped me gain about 5 pounds.

Had their french toast, scrambled eggs over toast, and salmon!  All were very delicious and the food's taste remained consistent, every time I went back.

The service was great, although it was always always packed with groups of hungry folk. Not the most spacious restaurant, so they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and charming place !  But the food is what makes a restaurant and this is definitely a great restaurant! We all chose, in our party of four, different apps, entrees and desserts just to be able to try different menu items cuz we just couldn't make up our minds what to try and everything we ordered was so amazingly delicious! We are determined to return and eat our way through the whole menu! Love the array of locally sourced food on the menu! Also a great place for drinks and sharing plates if you don't want a full meal!  And the desserts........ !  Love places that make their own desserts from scratch!  I can't say enough about this place! I definitely give it a 4.5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Très beau décor, ambiance sympa genre famille/lendemain de fête/entre potes/en amoureux. Un peu de tout donc, qui fait un chouette mix.

Côté nourriture, on retiendra les oeufs pochés avec les tomates épicées (et les grosses tranches de pain grillées... mmmm !), mais un peu moins le déjeuner turc (qui ressemble à je-mets-plein-de-choses-dans-l'assiette-mais-sans-cuisiner).

Et le truc le plus surprenant a été le jus betterave-pommes-ingrédient mystère, un vrai régal !"}
{"text":"Omg. Best food we've had in Montreal. Order all of the \"snacks\" tapas style. To die for. Would come back to the city just for this one place and I'm from Texas."}
{"text":"We came here with friends for brunch and absolutely loved the food, service and aura of the place. 
Ordered their Turkish Breakfast with merguez and Turkish coffee. Everything was spot on and tasted extremely good. Definitely coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Another place that has lines out the door for Brunch, but a little less so for Dinner.  On a Sunday night, it is one of the only things open so gave it a try.  Reviews looked good, so hopeful, but the night we were there they were out of oysters which it seems like this place has the best price on the block for.  

I had the burger.  It had a good crust but wasn't seasoned.  But the really good fries were and they were yummy.  My DC had the pork chop.  That was one of the best pork chops, smoky and tender that was done nicely and seasoned properly.  But it was served with what was supposed to be Aloo Gobi and lets just say  that was pretty much not worth having.  Really no flavor to it.  Wines were nice and service was good.  But just A OK, nothing to exciting."}
{"text":"Brunch - my favourite meal of the day. 
The Sparrow - my favourite brunch spot (thus far) in Montreal? I think so. 

Pork + eggs, served with a spread of applesauce and homemade \"tater tots\" and a biscuit, this is a savoury brunch lover's dream. 

And blood orange mimosa, I lingered over every sip. 

Getting food + drinks together (I know, so weird to order both at a restaurant!)? There are different owners for each 1/2 of this establishment, so the bill are written separately, and then together... which is a little confusing for the untrained eye. 

Also,  cash only, but there's an ATM at the top of the stairs."}
{"text":"Pleasant Sunday brunch place!

Drinks 5/5: I'm normally not a fan of lavender flavoured things because I find they taste like soap but their lavender latte was the right amount of fragrant! One friend got the ginger honey lemonade which was refreshing. Another friend got the cafe royal which I thought was a bit strong but he really liked it.

Food 3.5/5: I ordered the shakshuka and was relatively disappointed. It was literally tomato sauce with 2 eggs on top and some bread. The bread was too hard, I had trouble biting into it. The rest of my group was more satisfied with their food. Two friends got the eggs with sage which they liked except for the potatoes which she found to be on the sweet side. One friend tried it with bacon and the other tomato and they decided the tomato was better. My boyfriend had the oatmeal which had loads of toppings and was almost like eating dessert. Another friend got the house smoked trout and it was unanimously the winner of brunch! The pancake was savour and tasty and went very well with the fish and creme fresh. It came with a beet salad which was a nice touch to a balanced meals. 

Atmosphere 4/5: The place was very homey and comfortable. It's a fairly small space so there was quite a lineup outside for brunch. We were a group of six and we arrived at about 11am, initially they told us the wait time would be half an hour but it ended up being over an hour."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch there this past weekend and while the food was delicious, the service was NOT! It was about 15-20mins after we had been seated for our server to come get a coffee/drink order, which she promptly forgot and was another 15 mins that we managed to get her attention to get our cup of coffee. It's a shame, because the food is lovely and the neighborhood is super cute. It's the only place in Montreal that we were unhappy with our service during our visit."}
{"text":"I didn't even know they made food! lol. I went here a few times, late night for drinks. It was really fun. Friendly staff! 

I can't wait to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and had a shakshuka. It was delicious. It brought back so many memories from my trip to Israel. Finding that on the menu was such a wonderful surprise. Staff was friendly and decor is really cool."}
{"text":"Awesome fries.  Great beer and atmosphere.  Cool wait-staff.  And rumour has it they make the best BLT in Montreal.  Oh and there are line-ups for brunch.  The staff from Sparrow started a place called Lawrence (What an awesome name), which I tried and liked.  It lacks the ambience and cazh atmosphere of The Sparrow...but I'd go back.  I can't say if there is a ndifference now that the staff has moved on...but will check out Sparrow again soon and chime back in."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, loved dinner here tonight.

Lady who owns the place is very hands on and enthusiastic, which may be off putting to some, but i found it endearing. She loves to discuss the menu, drinks, talk about what they are trying to do with the place, asks how you like your dishes, likes to point out interesting tidbits about what the chef does for your dish, etc

She also asks if you have a time limit, which we did as we were going to catch a specific showing of a film at the humber theatre down the street, and made sure to accomodate that, bring the bill early, etc

Ordered oysters, scallops, sweetbreads, and the duck. All were great, especially the duck. Having a go to place for oysters and duck in the b-dub is a godsend. Red hot margarita was tasty, btw."}
{"text":"The Turkish coffee was bitter but cute and maybe we picked to eat the wrong dish right after the coffee because our steak and eggs dish tasted very bitter too. The presentation was so nice and it looked soooo appetizing, I  really wanted to enjoy it so bad but unfortunately, I didn't. Maybe I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Good food, even better service. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles, Eggs Benedict, and Lumber Jack Breakfast. Was a little disappointed to hear they no longer had the Steak n Eggs. 

All in all it was a good cozy place to eat."}
{"text":"LOVED The Sparrow. 

I didn't even know they serve food- but the bartender made the best dark and stormy I've ever had! I loved the aesthetics- from the sparrow stained glass, the furniture, the old photographs on the wall and the stocked book shelves. Good music and JENGA! Not to mention friendly people. All around a great vibe- I wish I could go back there right now!

The prices for cocktails were a little steep- $8 and not very big. That's pretty much my only complaint. Otherwise it was a total win and I definitely want to go back (and try their food!)."}
{"text":"I spent my Sunday brunch here with no doubt on its food, special, fancy. But I finally give no tips. When I went to the restaurant,there is long line, I spend 40mins in waiting to the top of line. But waiter let the guys come later me get the table first, cause they are two ppl and I only one, but actually the table I got, it's no difference with that two guys, but I spend more 24mins in waiting. I told them the reason why I give no tips when I paid, the waiter complained:\" people usually give low tips but no tips, but \"sorry \" about that.\" I just wanted to say \" usually restaurants do know what is first come, first service. If the restaurants do not know, pay for your customers! Our time is your profit!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with a friend after reading reviews and yum yum! I ordered the sunny side eggs, bacon, sourdough bread, and potatoes which were delicious! The granola and yogurt drizzled with honey and a side of fresh fruit was a nonstop yumfest. 

I'd advise getting there early since it fills up quickly for brunch, but it is well worth it. Next time I'm going to try the breakfast donuts with lemon curd cause they looked good!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. I went with the meetup group for brunch and it is a pleasant place to be in for brunch. An eclectic menu with a variety of fusion food. I took the Banh-Mi sandwich served with mixed green salad. It was a very good choice. I also ordered the mini donuts with three flavors (wow) this was really amazing. Our table was booked for 10:00am till 11:30am (this is the only time where they accept reservations). After that there is no reservation. It will be first come first served.
I liked the place so much and the food is good. I did not check their drinks menu as I was more interested in the brunch."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the late Dr. Generosity, so when I found out that The Sparrow was taking over the beloved restaurant's vacated spot, I had mixed feelings. After having brunch there yesterday, I can proudly say the tradition of amazing brunch continues.

The space has been revamped with industrial decor, and it seems a bit brighter, which is definitely a welcome change. Somehow it still reminds me of Dr. G's though. 

The menu is succinct, hitting the important brunch milestones. I settled on the eggs Benedict, which comes on a cheesy biscuit and swaps the usual hollandaise for a maltaise. I had never heard of a maltaise sauce but didn't give it much thought. Verdict: maltaise sauce is my new lover. A quick google search told me it's a hollandaise made with a splash of blood orange. Delicious! That combined with the cheesy biscuit actually took my breath away. 

The only weak spot was the coffee. First cup was lukewarm, second was piping hot but a bit bland. 

Don't let the coffee or the nostalgia for Dr. G keep you away. The Sparrow is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here today for Sunday brunch with a best friend. We actually wanted to go to Good Fork but an hour wait wasn't something my stomach could hold any longer. 

We were seated right away and water came shortly after. Service is great here.  

Candied Trout Salad (14) 
I really, really liked this. It was a bit on the pricey side though. The trout was good quality and the feta complimented the fish. 

Mushroom Frittata (14)
My friend seemed to really like it and actually couldn't finish it! It comes out in a skillet actually and for the portions they gave, it's worth it. 

The dishes were really well made and care was clearly taken to make it. The only thing is that it's a bit pricey for brunch, but I guess the $5 Caesars/mimosas make up for it... 

Oh and visit the washrooms!! (You should be a good kid and wash your hands before you eat anyways.)"}
{"text":"When we checked into our Mile End BnB at the start of our Montreal vacation, we already had a good idea of places we wanted to eat -- The Sparrow was one of them. Unbeknownst to us, our host had filled a chalkboard wall of his kitchen with food recommendations for us to check out -- and The Sparrow was at the top of his list! This place does not fail to live up to either his or our expectations. The food is quality, the drinks are strong and delicious and (for a New Yorker) cheap, and for dessert you absolutely MUST get the cheese plate. That latter indulgence was so good, we came back on the last night of our trip to have it again! A must-visit if you find yourself in the Mile End!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch while in town for the jazz fest.

Brunch was solid tho not spectacular: good pangcakes and smoked trout hash, OK bacon, and refreshing bourbon lemonades. Deidre did a nice job behind the bar, but our food took a long, long time (two other bar parties got there 10 min after us, but got food served 10-15 min before us).

Overall, didn't live up to the hype, but I'd go back to try out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"High five!  
Sparrow's food + interior + drinks = happiness mathematics.

Brunch
Excellent. Its not often I want to try almost everything off a single menu. The steak and eggs is fantastic. My guy ordered the apple pancakes which were massive with applesauce on top and nice walnuts plus fresh cream. The coffee is delicious.

Cocktails
Wonderful. 

The Space
Vintage vibe with low lighting that makes for a cozy cool date spot or night with friends."}
{"text":"Went to sparrow on Friday night. Was really excited to try it. The atmosphere and the decor has changed drastically from dr generosity . It's a great improvement but that was it, the menu was so pretentious and didn't have anything of interest. The waitress had to explain the specials ... That's when we should have left. I just want good food not an education on how to read your complicated menu! We had the scallops, that were not bad but also ordered the fish which was the most terrible fish I have ever tasted in my life. The chickpeas , peppers and olives... Worst combination ever!!!! If you want good food run don't walk away from sparrow .the wine was good!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, at a table and not the bar.

Lovely ambiance, although a bit cold on the temperature side for my liking. The menu is simple, without pretense (none of those names you won't recognize).

We ordered oysters and devils on a horseback. Oyster were fresh, but nothing outstanding. The other appetizer was an interesting discovery for me, very interesting mix of bacon, plums and caramelized sauce.

As for the mains, they gave hearty portions. The pan-roasted trout came with some simple vegetable (a ball of carrot slaw, roasted cauliflower, and diced tomato salad) and herb-flavoured basmati rice. The pork chops came with some wedge potatoes and vegetables. Simple, but effective.

Service was attentive without being over bearing. 

On the downside, the food seemed slow to come. The second appetizer seemed to have taken forever to appear at our table, and we waited for the mains too, long after having polished off the appetizers.

I would come back to try their brunch and their alcohols, which sadly we didn't get to sample."}
{"text":"We came here at 12:30pm for brunch and the hostess told us it would be a half hour wait. Nonetheless, it was way faster, we probably waited 15 minutes. We were pretty hungry given the late time. I ordered the Shakshua with Merguez (lamb sausage). It was good but I wouldn't say amazing. Party because it was not super filling and the poached eggs. Unfortunately the poached eggs were hard. It would have been a totally game changer if it was soft boiled. The sourdough toast was delicious. My friend got the Fried Eggs with Sage. It was served in a cast iron with potatoes, sourdough toast, and bacon (or a healthier option with grilled tomatoes). My friend opt for the bacon."}
{"text":"A super cute place that serves food with a Middle Eastern / Mediterranean slant. I was brought here by friends for brunch and was very impressed. I get so sick of going out to brunch and paying $15 for eggs, it's far more worth it when there's something unique about the food that I wouldn't bother to make at home. Sparrow has me covered there, from Shakshuka to even a breakfast Banh-Mi. I myself ordered the Zaatar sandwich with merguez - heck YES!!!!! And oh, was it goooooood. Came with potatoes and a nice salad too, great deal.

I also had the basil gimlet which was super refreshing and just a hint of sweet. My friends had the Caeser - a bloody mary variation - and ... well I forgot, but it was purple and tasted excellent too. 

Awesome spot, can get a little crowded but it's only because it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Très ambiance Mile-End, l'espace est grand et agréable! 
La carte des cocktails est tout aussi plaisante. On sent un vrai travail de recherche pour ceux-ci, on a d'ailleurs eu du mal à fixer nos choix. 
La déception nous est venue de la quantité, les cocktails étaient servis dans des coupes de petites contenances. Mêmes si les associations d'alcool étaient bonnes, nous avons trouvés dommage de ne pas avoir des quantités plus adéquates."}
{"text":"Favourite place for brunch! I love the interior design, and the food is amazing. They take reservations for brunch at 10am, so if you're an early bird (not me, and pun not intended), I suggest making one as they have long waits.

I had the shakshuka with chorizo, and it's probably the best I've had yet. Great coffee as well, and I would love to come back for their dinner/bar."}
{"text":"Came to Sparrow with my roommate and her mother, who was visiting from Ottawa. We liked the traditional pub ambience and the fun cocktail menu. The food was pretty good as well. Nice location right in Mile End."}
{"text":"Loved Sparrow. 
Their space is fun and they really take advantage of the space. 
I took my family out from Sunday brunch and none of us were disappointed. 
Two of us started off with coffee, my mother and I opted for the fresh pressed beet juice. Yum. 
My mother and sister got the thyme fried eggs. Looked very good, and the bacon was thick and meaty. The eggs are free range and organic, the yolks where a beautiful rich orange. I really appreciate places that advertise it on their menu and decide to use organic ingredients. It can be surprisingly rare to see in Montreal. 
My dad decided on the granola and yogurt. It looked amazing. A mound of thick delicious yogurt covered in fruit and homemade granola. 
I went for the Shakshuka with merguez sausage. It was delicious. 
I will be back to check out their upstairs tea room."}
{"text":"For me Sparrow is best for polenta fries, hamburger and a stiff drink at the bar. Warm, dim, thoughtful and humorous with a good weekday lunch and weekend brunch. Same owners as at Blizzarts and Korova, same excellent music, friendly staff and event-organizer artist extended community. Upstairs is awesome - beautiful wooden balcony, simple stage and seating, beautiful but empty bar (no license yet sadly - maybe they could sell old-timey soda pops?)"}
{"text":"To be honest I ended up here as a second choice because the line at Beauty's was about an hour long.......that being said, next time this is my 1st choice! Sparrow is a great restaurant tucked into St-Laurent exactly in-between St-Viateur and Fairmount (which is strange since they don't serve bagels). The restaurant has a really nice neighborhood feel and a menu full of unique dishes that all have a Mediterranean/Middle-East influence. The dishes are a nice sized potion and DELICIOUS! Service was great, and if you're waiting by the door for a table they'll invite you to sit on the stairs inside and order coffee (which doesn't really make me feel better about waiting for a table). The wait was only about 15 minutes and definitely worth it.  My Zaatar egg sandwich with merguez sausage was one of the best things I've had in a while, it was just brimming with multiple flavors to create an amazing dish. My cousin had the buckwheat pancakes which were outstanding.....an adjective I've never used to describe anything made with buckwheat. One added delicacy was the 3 mini doughnuts you can order as a side-dish. (lemon, PB&J and Nutella). This was a restaurant I always heard of as one of the better brunch places in the city but never went to until now. I'm going back....who's with me??!!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar.  I went at night with 2 friends to get drinks, and we had a great time.  This bar is very small and intimate.  It's classy but also feels comfortable and casual.  Because we came after midnight, many drinks were being served at discounted prices.  My favorite thing about this bar was that it was quiet and I could talk to my friends at a socially acceptable distance without having to yell over loud bar/club music.  It was cozy, the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine or two while chatting with friends and watching passersby outside the window.  It was very fun and relaxing.  I would recommend this place to a friend.  

There's also a super cute team room upstairs!! :)"}
{"text":"I had the squash enchiladas with pulled pork. Magnificent! The portion was just right with some scrambled eggs and baked beans on the side. My favourite brunch so far. I also tried the red velvet waffle. Very interesting dish with poached pears and chocolate mousse, but couldn't taste the red velvet at all. 
My boyfriend had today's special, deep fried egg and some deep fried toast, he said they were average."}
{"text":"Amazing for weekend brunch. I've been a few times and I always forget just how good it is and how unique the choices are. It also changes relatively often which is super cool.

They have some standard brunch items like eggs, bacon and toast as well as yogurt and cereal if you want to keep it classic. They also have really neat egg creations such as benedicts, scrambles, and shakshuka. Last time I was there, I got a Turkish breakfast which was a bunch of extremely fresh unique ingredients that included fig jam, pita, a variety of nuts, soft boiled eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, fruit, etc. The plate was beautifully assembled (see picture) and it tasted just as good. I also had a latte which was also tasty. They serve their hot drinks in these antique tea cups which is a little detail I really enjoy.

I keep meaning to come back here for a night out because I'm sure it's great."}
{"text":"Came to try out sparrow's brunch after hearing good things about it. We started off with some coffee and doughnuts that resembled super-sized timbits, filled peanut butter and jelly, Nutella, and jam. Coffee had just the right amount of kick and the doughnuts were delicious.

For mains we ordered shakshuka and smoked trout. The shakshuka was awesome and the merguez sausages were out of this world. The smoked trout was fresh and savoury and the beet salad that came with it complemented it well.

Overall, it was a great experience. I would certainly be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. We have been asked to leave in a very rude manner by the waiter 5 mins after we ordered a drink and right after the waiter got his tip obviously. Very basic brunch."}
{"text":"LOVED this place, maybe it was the ambiance, maybe it was the amazing company, maybe it was the friendly and efficient service, or maybe it was the fantastic food, but I have nothing but good things to say about this brunch place! 

We arrived here around 11am in the afternoon, and were lucky enough to be seated right away. They don't take reservations, so I highly recommend coming before the brunch rush (which starts flooding in around 12pm). Our server came over with menus and water right away, and we were soon happily mulling over what we wanted to order. I ordered coffee, which comes with unlimited refills ($2), and you can ask for soy milk instead of the usual milk or cream. The coffee was fantastic, and the unlimited refills satisfied my early morning need for caffeine.

My friend had been here in the past and recommended the house-smoked trout ($16). I was trying to decide between this dish and the Shakshuka ($13), which contains two poached eggs in a Morrocan spiced tomato sauce and sourdough toast. Both sounded amazing, but with the reverent reviews of the trout, I had to try it for myself. 

Once we ordered, our food arrived pretty quickly, in under 15 min. The house-smoked trout comes with a hefty portion of delicious smoked trout, on top of savoury and fluffy green onion pancakes, a soft boiled egg, side of beets and creme fraiche to complement. It was a huge portion for $16, and I was completely satisfied after. I was so glad I ordered this, and if given the choice, would hands down order it again. The lightness of the creme fraiche and green onion pancakes went perfectly with the saltier, more dense texture of the trout. 

Service was amazing throughout, food was fantastic, and I loved the hip, quiet and homey environment. I'll definitely be back the next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Gros coup de coeur pour les déjeuners du Sparrow! L'endroit est magnifique, juste assez grand pour pouvoir accueillir un max de personne, sans enlever l'effet chaleureux recherché pour un brunch! 

Nous avons mangé le sandwich naan , qui était succulent et la truite fumée qui était toute aussi délicieuse! Le café est super, il y a des cocktails déjeuners aussi qui avaient l'air DÉBILES!

Le prix est vraiment raisonnable, tu t'en sors à 30$ pour deux facilement !"}
{"text":"Nous y allions pour boire seulement.
(alors ce n'est pas un review de la bouffe ;) )

L'ambiance était bonne pour un jeudi soir tard,
Nos 2 drinks : Frenck 75 et Basil Gimlet étaient vraiment savoureux.
Lorsqu'on a commandé 2 bières cream ale, on nous a servit 2 IPA (qu'on a gardés parce qu'on n'aime pas le gaspillage mais on était pas mal déçues).
Le service était super inéfficace... heureusement on était pas mal relax nous aussi.
 
Finalement, on y retournera, mais on ne le recommande pas TANT QUE Ça...
Ne pas faire un détour... mais s'y arrêter si on est dans le coin."}
{"text":"haven't tried the breakfast yet, but late at night for a drink.
i love their bathroom wallpaper."}
{"text":"The  calamary were pretty tasty. I like their Irish nachos and desserts: Creme Brulee Cheesecake and especially Salted Caramel Lava."}
{"text":"Sparrow has been my favourite place in Mile End to get a cocktail for the last five years. But recently, I've come to realize that it is also a great place to grab dinner. The dinner menu is short but sweet, with the polish of a fancier resto while keeping most prices under $20. My companion ploughed through a plate of pork roast, South Asian-inflected potatoes, greens, and cilantro garnish simply because it was some of the tastiest pork either of us had had in a long time. The serving was generous enough for me to sneak a few bites in and get some not-so-generous looks from across the table. While I might still opt for Nouveau Palais' burger if forced to choose, Sparrow's was exactly what I wanted -- eggy roll, priced in the low teens, good fries and that telltale grease drip that tells you they're doing it right. Every time I have been, there has been at least one attractive, substantial vegetarian option that leads with vegetable protein like lentils (a harder standard to meet in the neighbourhood than you might think). 

So next time you are brunching or sipping a drink here, have a look at the dinner menu too. (But in moderation, because I still want to be able to get a table.)"}
{"text":"Nice, spruced up but unpretentious neighborhood place that seems to appeal to a young crowd. Was well taken care of by the harried but polite staff during a brief lull in a busy mid-summer brunch. Dejeuner Turc avec merguez and a couple pints of IPA really hit the spot. Word is they have a good burger. I'll be back."}
{"text":"i came here only for a bloody mary, which was really good, cool space and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I will be honest. I had a bad experience at The Lawrence, a restaurant that had been started by several previous employees. That bad experience actually kept me far away from this place until I visited this restaurant with family. 

I have to say after all my apprehension it was a pretty darn good experience!! 

I enjoyed the entré of olives and nuts and I know my company enjoyed the cheese and cracker entré as well!

We also had some oysters, and I will admit I'm new to oysters from about a year and a half ago, but these were really good and I wished we had ordered more. 

The main course, butter chicken curry was actually very good. I would say it lacked just a bit of seasoning but the flavors were powerful yet subtle and the accompanying rice and salads were just delicious!

I need to take a moment to say I tried to order the butter chicken and a full salad. He waitress wisely advised me that would be too much food, and was very accommodating when I asked for a side sized salad instead. It was a delicious arugula salad. I definitely suggest you try it or share it!

Personally I stayed away from this place for a couple years but I feel like I missed out during that time ! Check it out ! Good ambience and nice waiters and delicious food. Can't go wrong with that !"}
{"text":"Been there twice despite the amazing reviews, simply wasn't wowed by it.

Coffee taste burnt and the dishes were just ok. Had an egg and steak: steak was tasteless.

Decor is hipster."}
{"text":"I had a very \"OK\" experience at Sparrow. It was full and we had to wait a little before sitting which is fine seeing how other restos surrounding had over an hour waiting list. The waitresses were very polite and efficient, overall no problem with the service. The food though, was ok. Nothing special, nothing extraordinary, simply ok. Seeing how people were actually waiting in line I was expecting a lot more. But no, just, ok. My girlfriend had steak and eggs which was a very average plate and she was disappointed by their supreme coffee which really just tasted like ok coffee. I had pancakes, and was charged an extra for asking for maple syrup. I repeat, I was charged for asking maple syrup for my pancakes in a brunch establishment. Well, I tried."}
{"text":"Love the quiet and dark ambiance, one star, service ok, so two stars.  Great area and open late.  Last Word Cocktail - worst ever, so much lime, so much ice, brutal - not often I cant finish a cocktail.  Love my little sparrow bar mat I stole."}
{"text":"In addition to great tasting food, Sparrow met all the other things I look for in a great restaurant:

1. When there is a wait, you are treated as a customer and with respect- not just another name/number a server has to tend to

2. You're given water right away without having to ask

3. Someone checks in within a few minutes to get in a drink order

4. Coffee refills happen without asking thanks to an observant and engaged front of house staff

5. The food is made within a very reasonable amount of time so that you're not starving :)

6. The presentation of your food makes you want to devour it right away without first snapping a pic, of course ;)

7. The decor. Classy, inviting, comfy, and refreshing. Especially after a night of boozing

8. The staff are all smiles :)

I recommend trying any of Fried Eggs with Sage, Breakfast Banh-Mi, or Steak & Eggs.

If you're looking for more of a traditional bfast, go with Fried Eggs with Sage. If you're a fan of Vietnamese Subs and maybe you're feeling like you want breakfast but also leaning towards lunch, choose that option. It's huge, well worth your money. If you want a Turkish twist and want Meat (and you're a fan of steak) do the Steak & Eggs.

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! I decided to explore around Montreal for a new brunch spot in the Mile End and discovered this classy and chic location with friendly staff and a very unique menu. 

I had the Smoked Trout which came with pouched eggs, roasted beets, and three pieces of potato cakes! What a meal! I really enjoyed the combination included in my brunch. The smoked trout tasted like smoked salmon but less fishy, the potato cakes came with whipped butter which made it extra creamy and smooth. The beets was cooked perfectly. Overall an epic brunch which costed me close to $22 after tax and tips.

The coffee here is also amazing, it was only $2 and it came with unlimited refills! It was freshly brewed and they also had brown and white sugar for you to add in your coffee which was a plus!

My friend had the steak and eggs and it looked really good. However his comment to me was it was pretty standard and had better elsewhere. However it looked good to me so I plan to try it next!

Overall, we spent over two hours in this place and enjoyed every minute of our brunch. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"A great brunch restaraunt to visit if you're ever in Montreal's Mile End area! 

The ambiance of the restaraunt, from the decor of the place to the cutlery and plates used is very hip and rustic ~~

The service and food was good.

I ordered the shakshouka  (poached egg in a spiced peppery tomatoe sauce served with bread) and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of fancy brunches. I am very happy with eggs and bacon at a breakfast/brunch venue. 

However, the bar, the bar is why I go to the Sparrow. Great ambiance, not to loud so great for conversations. My friends like their Old fashioned cocktail, i get my bourbon fix and everybody is cheerful."}
{"text":"This is a review of Sparrow as a brunch joint. I'm not a cocktail-bar guy (I'm a beer-snob and if I'm not on the beer I'm hitting the whisky). But I did have a caesar the other day and it was lovely. I hear the other cocktails are killer too; but their tap list is terrible. 

Anyway. Brunch is lovely. Drip coffee is great. Nice old-school donuts; several delicious egg dishes. Buckwheat pancakes. Smoked trout. Everything we had was good. And the chicks working there are hot. 

The cappuccino sucks. (Yeah, I'm an espresso prick, too.)"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. Stepped in here with a couple of friends for drinks at about 9pm last night. Nice, intimate atmosphere. One of the few places that actually delivers on how cozy it looks from the outside. 

We found a good table right in the middle of the place. Ordered a few cocktails, which I don't usually, but felt like it, and they were awesome and strong. Server and peeps were also really nice. 

We didn't order food, but burgers and things kept going past us and they looked effing great. So I'll definitely be going back here soon with food in mind too.

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"D'abord , signifions que l'endroit me plait. J'aime l'ambiance style Brooklyn, chose trop rare dans la métropole québécoise. Je m'assieds au bar. Le barman est visiblement en training. Se passe quelques minutes avant qu'il soit disponible à prendre ma commande. Je lui demande une Saint-Ambroise, arrive une griffon. Je peux vivre avec cela. Bowie chante Velvet Goldmine. Nice. Je choisis le BLT. Je remarque que sur le menu seul le cash est accepté (youhou, en 2013!). Je demande au Waiter en training: avec vous une guichet automatique. Il me répond non, juste un ATM (louche) au 2e. MDR vs LOL.  Bowie chante Modern love. Cool. Le BLT arrive avec les frites en accompagnement pour 3.50$ de plus.  Les frites sont molasses et mal cuites. Consternation. Le BLT est immensément gras. La mayo mal montée n'aidant pas la cause, ni le bacon mal cuit. 

À côté, au bar, un couple de hipster. La fille, à la drôle de coupe de cheveux, prend des photos de la barbe de son mec, avec son nikon reflex digital doté d'un objectif haut de gamme. Leur assiette arrive: un grilled cheese avec des frites. Le hipster annonce au serveur qu'il n'a pas commandé de frites(bonne idée). Le Waiter lui dit pas de soucis, on ne te chargera pas les frites. Le hipster et sa copine mangent évidemment toutes les frites. C'est bien manger des frites gratis, non?   Ils trempent même leur grllled cheese dans la mayo grasse et  insipide. Yark. Frustrant de penser que je vais payer mes frites (que j'ai peu mangées) ainsi qu'un frais de ATM banditos de 2$. Evidemment, personne ne m'a demandé si le plat était à mon gout. Les beatles chantent I Wanna hold my hand. Pas mal moins drole. Mérite 2 étoiles plus une 3e en bonus pour l'ambiance générale.  Moins une étoile pour le mode de paiement frustrant. On termine à 2?"}
{"text":"Came to Sparrow on Sat Oct 2 for brunch with 4 others.  Got there as it opened at 10AM.  Staff were very friendly and on the ball even though the place filled by 10:30am.  A forgotten side of the potato-cabbage dish was on the house even though we said it was totally fine.  We were enjoying the food and atmosphere so much, a slight oversight was easily forgiven. Glad we did not cancel that side though b/c it was great!  

I had the Eggs Florentine with smoked salmon.  The hollandaise was just right...not too heavy or overpowering!  everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their choices as well!  Coffee was a nice medium-bold that complimented the meal (sometimes we forget just how important coffee can be to set the tone for the meal...especially after a late night before!)

In the two days we spend in Montreal, I believe we hit the two best brunch places in the city...this one and Le Cartet on McGill!  Thanks to my fellow Yelper's for the great advise on both these places!

Special NOTE:  They don't take credit or debit so be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Went here on recommendation from a friend when my husband and I were first timers in Montreal. Inside is super cute with a great bar. We grabbed two seats at the bar and got a delish and spicy Bloody Mary and coffee. The menu had a Mediterranean/Moroccan influence which we love. I got the Zatar breakfast sandwich.. fried egg, tomato, cucumber ribbons, lots of herbs and some toasted seed spread. Came with a yummy yogurt dill sauce and on toasted flatbread bread. The plates food were served on were mismatch antique looking and pretty cool. Same for coffee cups. 
We arrived on the early side due to their website noting they only take reservations for the 10:00 spot right when they open and seeing reviews that they fill up quick. This was true! We arrived around 10:20 and were the first bar customers and by 10:45 bar was full and line out the door. 

Side note, a girl helping the bartender broke a glass on the beer tap grill causing them to have to burn and refill the ice for safety of guests. The bartender was super calm about it even though he was really busy and the manager (maybe owner) swooped right in to help in a very calm manner as well. This was nice to see as I've bartended for many years and things can get stressful and mangers (owners) can be assholes when mistakes happen and these two reacted great and made it like no big deal. 

Will return again!!"}
{"text":"Hmm, Heard lots about the restaurant from friends and from the reviews here. Yes the place does have great staff with a friendly and cozy vibe. Unfortunately the deal breaker for me was the food itself. I guess I am just not a big fan of polenta fries (my first time trying) D: But not to discourage other people, they have lots of other stuff in their menu, I am sure if I head the next time I'll find some thing appetizing for my taste buds :)"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city! 
Eggs with sage are ridiculously good, and if you don't want the bacon (which you do!) there's also an option to get tomatoes instead. The juices are so delicious too!
The Turkish breakfast is light and tasty and the shakshouka is pretty good too! I also love the salmon gravlax dish. 
Good service, cute decor."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went there for breakfast on a Sunday. We were three so it only took 10 minutes to be seated. It is quite possibly the best breakfast I've had. The staff was really friendly! I had the buckwheat pancakes and they were amazing! The peanut butter donuts are a must! Enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Final brunch on this particular trip.

Walked in to a busy restaurant with a bit of an old school vibe and wooden bar. 

We were sat at the bar per our request. Great decision as the bartender made great recommendations and had a great attitude.

Tried the latte - no complaints. 
Tried the beet/carrot/some other fruit fresh made juice combination - light refreshing and tasty!

I ordered the smoke trout - comes with an egg, beets, and what tastes like a seasoned pancake? At the bottom. Delicious! Haven't tried smoked trout before but was quite similar to smoked salmon.

The wife ordered the Shakshuda - think poached eggs surrounded by a tomato based sauce served with some bread and a choice of feta cheese or lamb sausage on the side. We opted to try both and were not dissapointed! Interestingly the seasoning on the lamb sausage had a very authentic taste to it and the rest of the dish was enjoyable as well.

Would absolutely repeat for brunch - great service, great food, and was surprised by how much I liked that beet/carrot juice combination. 

Price: give or take 20-25 per head."}
{"text":"As a Sparrow fan for the past couple years, I was completely let down by my experience with them this morning. 

There were five of us in the group, waiting for a table, which took a while but I'm used to that. When we finally got seated, the waitress took our drink orders while we waited for the last person in our party to arrive. The bar was backed up the whole time we were there, and it took forever to get any of our drinks -- again, I'm used to that, and we're a pretty patient group. 

Another waitress came by to ask if we were still waiting for the last person in our party, and I told her that we were, but that we were ready to order and that our friend had told us not to wait for her. She took the three other orders at the table, and when she got to me, I forgot my order and began to mumble, at which point she decided it would be cute and funny to COUNT ME DOWN. As in, \"3...2...1... I'm leaving\" so I blurted out a menu item and away she went, leaving our table bewildered, confused and uncomfortable. As someone who has worked in customer service before (not food service, but still dealing with long lines of impatient clients), I understand being rushed, stressed and under staffed, but that was just plain rude and condescending and wholly uncalled for. She could have just come back to our table. Again I understand that it must have been frustrating for me to tell her that we were ready to order, and then be indecisive when my turn came to give my order, but still. 

When our last friend arrived, the same waitress went past our table checking on other tables beside us at least six times, noticing my friend but not stopping to take her order or even acknowledge that she had arrived. From my personal experience, it is completely acceptable to tell a customer \"Hi, I'll be with you in a minute\" and not leave the customer waiting around wondering if someone is ever going to come take their order. My friend had to tap her on the shoulder to get her attention, when she was just standing behind us looking around the room. Again, Sparrow is a tight space, it was very busy, it's difficult for the waitstaff to navigate between tables, but it seemed like she flat out ignored our table after she took our orders, which brings me to my next point. 

Sparrow has a great ambiance, which unfortunately rests on the place being extremely loud, not just because of how packed it is, but also because of the music. The noise level is just plain ridiculous, I'm sorry, ambiance is one thing, not being able to hear/ be heard by your customers is another. Our orders got mixed up because she couldn't hear us over the music, which is fine, forgetting people's side orders is fine, but when the time came for us to get the bill it was beyond unacceptable. They mixed up our bills, as some of us were getting bills together and others were getting their own, but halfway through our meal we had ordered a second round of coffees and drinks, which the waitress didn't forget to bill us for, she just forgot to put the orders in to the bar, which was backed up. So my friend and I got our second drinks only after we painstakingly pointed out to the waitress that they'd been billed and not delivered to our table. 

The food at Sparrow is always good, I usually always leave very pleased with my meal, but the service we got today is enough for me to say that I won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"This is one of the top 5 best places for brunch in Montreal, hands down. The food is always delicious and cooked with perfection. The staff is lovely and the ambience is super chill."}
{"text":"I don't want to be a hater,  as this is a pretty fine resto-bar. This merely explain my personal feeling on that place. 
The place is considered a jewel in Mile End with good prices. The food looked pretty good and they have a full bar. I arrived at 8:00 PM-ish. It was on the verge of being jam packed with the Saturday crowd. It's definitively a 25-40 yo type of bar. Good vibe, music is not too loud. Overall spacious enough for large group or date nights or hang out with few friends."}
{"text":"I got the steak and eggs for brunch. After cutting through egg yolks, steak and chimchurri, the bottom of my plate was a watery mess, which caused my potatoes to get all soggy. 

The eggs were cooked well and the sourdough bread was perfectly toasted, but the rest was pretty underwhelming (steak wasn't seasoned, potatoes were bland, etc). Also, everything was stacked on a tiny plate like we were playing Jenga, making it tricky to eat. 

On the plus side, despite the never ending flow of customers, everyone on the floor was on point and super friendly. 

Not the worst brunch I've had, but nothing extraordinary about it either."}
{"text":"The buckwheat pancakes are incredible. Super fluffy and covered in great syrup, whipped cream, and lots of different fruits (pear, pomegranate, fig, grapefruit). 

The apple, beet, and ginger juice is also quite good."}
{"text":"The first time I went to an indie mart, I was meeting my friend Felice.  When I saw her, I was like \"Felice!  This place is crawling with hipsters\".  She shushed me really hard: \"Shhhhh! Hipsters don't like to be called hipsters.\"  This is how I feel about Sparrow.  Brunch here is pretty good though."}
{"text":"Server was not knowledgable about the wine, could not describe the two we were choosing between nor make a recommendation based on what we were ordering. However was very pleasant and checked on us. Gnocchi was a highlight, burratta odd - why pair a delicate, fresh creamy cheese with a heavy poppy seed cream sauce?? Duck tough though tastey. Beautiful space. Might go back and order other dishes since it is so conveniently located; on the other hand, much MUCH better available in the west end for a better price point (Zeze Food and Drink comes to mind, Fat Cat Wine Bar)"}
{"text":"I had their beet and carrot juice which was good. I had the buckwheat pancake and it was not that great! Its not the best place for vegetarian breakfast."}
{"text":"Good brunch fare, nice atmosphere, and trendy decor. Service was friendly and attentive, food was good, lacked a little seasoning. Will return."}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend for brunch and it was full house, but they take reservation, which is quite unusual for brunch hours at restaurants in Plateau. I find the interior decor of Sparrow less impressive than Cardinal Tea House which is upstairs, but it's still quite good. I tried their homemade trout and my friend took the shakshuka, both were really great! The dishes are really beautiful and the taste quite unique, since it's Turkish-Moroccan style, which is quite flavourful and exotic. I was a bit surprised that the smoked trout was a bit warm, which tasted quite good! My friend really fell in love for the yummy sauce of her shakshuka dish, and me too! However, I found the service below average and the food was served quite slowly. The noise level was also really high and it was hard to have a nice conversation."}
{"text":"This place is nuts on Sundays. Every hipster in town seems to be having brunch here. Buddy and I were lucky in that we were seated at the bar almost immediately. I had the Bahn-mi breakfast sandwich which was stuffed with fried eggs, slow-cooked pork belly, shredded carrots, daikon radish, cilantro and a few slices of Asian red chillies along with some sauce. I ate it right up along with side order of roasted potatoes. My friend had the buckwheat pancakes and couldn't stop raving about it. It was a giant mound of pancakes slathered with bacon. I also had a blood orange mimosa. Talk about a rich brunch. Food and ambiance were A1 but hipsters really annoy me so if I go back, it will probably at a slower time."}
{"text":"Chalkboard Brunch

    One of my favourite spots for brunch. Great, friendly service with new spins on brunch like tortilla chips and chuncky guac or poached citrus and quark cheese. 

   Their pork belly was fall apart tender with a fantastic sear on it, bottom line, I've yet to eat anything at the sparrow I haven't liked and they make a mean Tequila Sunrise. If there is a better way to start your Sunday, I am open to suggestion.

  I have also received, via a reliable source, word that they make a great cheese burger...all in do time, The Sparrow.

    Final warning, beware the hipsters. I have a feeling that all the 'wool sweater crowd' who go to Divan Orange have heard word of how good The Sparrow's breakfast is...if only they didn't offer a vegetarian option....

{"text":"La décoration de ce petit restaurant est très belle et s'intègre parfaite au quartier. Nous avons eu de l'attente pour avoir une table (nous étions un groupe de 5 personnes). Les assiettes de brunch sortent du traditionnel brunch. Bon dans l'ensemble."}
{"text":"Excellent spot in Bloor West Village. Superb food quality and laid back yet attentive, first class service. We had virgin cocktails - my caesar was delish! we shared the beet salad, which was very good, but the scallops stole the show - hands down. Perfectly cooked, golden and crispy on the outside, topped with pancetta bits, served with veggie pate. Best! 
Two thumbs up Sparrow!"}
{"text":"Si je pouvais, j'aimerais bien donner un 4.5 en fait. Ça été un excellent brunch! La formule 3 services, dont on choisi un plat principal mais le reste est le même m'a bien plu même si je n'étais pas certaine au départ. Habituée d'avoir dix milles options pour le brunch à plusieurs autres endroits, ça m'a un peu déboussolé, mais pour une personne qui a souvent de la difficulté à décider quoi prendre, 3 options, c'est un nombre parfait. Ça m'a pris moins de 5 minutes à me décider et donc j'ai eu  plus de temps pour jaser, siroter mon café et mon César. Je ne suis pas allée au Moineau pour un cocktail en soirée, mais celui du matin était très bien fait. D'autres options de style mimosa sont aussi disponible tôt en journée. Pour le repas comme tel, c'était délicieux. J'ai pris les oeufs rancheros, et si j'avais eu un peu plus de place dans mon estomac, j'aurais demandé une deuxième assiette, surtout parce qu'ici, si vous en voulez plus (pour le brunch), ça fait parti du service (et du même prix.) Un bon resto pour prendre son temps et manger un brunch en bonne compagnie avant d'aller flâner sur la rue Saint-Laurent, ou bien au marché Jean Talon."}
{"text":"Came for brunch during the summer and tried the  house smoked trout, the  shakshuka and the buckwheat pancakes. Both of the salty dishes were fantastic and original tasting for  brunch items. The savory pancakes in the trout dish were a lovely surprise and I would love to see it on more menus around town.   The pancakes were extremely sweet for breakfast (more appropriate for a dessert). 

If I lived  in the area, I would definitely eat at Sparrow more often, but unlike Régine Café I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip here unless I was meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"OMFG I love the Sparrow. I stupidly waited 45 minutes to get into Lawrence, was still 7th on the list and then my stomach told me \"F*&k this noise\" and I walked a block down to Sparrow where I had what was quite possibly the best brunch of my life: eggs benedict, nom nom. It was nestled on a buttery, home made biscuit topped with perfectly cooked asparagus and just the right amount of hollandaise. There were home made tater tots on the side (SO yummy!) and the latte I had with it was absolute perfection. The prices are right, service is great and the location cannot be beat. Too bad the place was 3/4 hipster, but I was able to ignore them and look out the window."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat obsessed with lentils of all sorts and while there were many vegetarian options on the menu the night that I visited for dinner, I couldn't pry my eyes away from the lentil & mushroom stew. I know it sounds zzz but trust me when I say I barely did any talking during my reunion with my college best friend because I was so busy slurping up this stew. I still can't stop thinking about it! No menu or web presence means I can't recount exactly what was in it, but it was thick, hearty and very earthy with all that mushroomy goodness. The polenta fries weren't nearly as exciting as promised - just sort of flavourless. French 75 cocktail was dynamite. 

Not much to say about the service - it's unsurprisingly slow so come with low expectations. They did allow completely separate cheques though which is always appreciated. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to waste away any valuable time for my short weekend trip, so I searched hard for a good brunch place that takes reservation so we didn't have to line up. Luckily for me, I found the the Sparrow! 

I had serious dish envy when I saw my friend's Blackstone Benedict ($15)- poached eggs, bacon, wilted greens and tomato on root vegetable latkes, herb hollandaise and tater tots. I was able to steal a few bites and it was quite delicious, albeit slightly under-seasoned.

My boyfriend went for fried chicken and waffles ($15.5)- fried chicken, buttermilk waffles, sunny eggs, white gravy and honey. No complaints about this one!

Sadly for me, I was the most disappointed with my own selection - pulled pork ($14) with homemade biscuit, coleslaw, homemade tater tots, and two sunny eggs. I realized then that I only like BBQ-style pulled pork, and this one just didn't appeal to me. I really should've ordered the red velvet waffles, which sounded divine. 

All in all, despite my own disappointing dish selection, it was quite an enjoyable brunch. I thought the restaurant was very cute and the food, in general, was tasty. Even now, I'm still thinking about the red velvet waffle that I could have tried."}
{"text":"So I had googled this place before going and it looked cool. The moment I got there, I had an inner \"Ya, I totally dig this place\" moment.  Luckily I was there before my friend showed up and got a chance to really sit and soak it up.  The brick walls, vintage wood chairs, the gorgeous looking bar and the couch with the chest next to it. \"I wonder what could be in there?\", I thought.  The wooden banister is such a nice touch as well.  They have a bunch of really cool old photographs down at the end of the bar.  They're the type of photographs that you could look at for hours if you were peaking on psychopsilocybin.  But since I'm way to intelligent for that type of fun now, all I needed was a minute and a half to realize how cool they were.

The food was really good and very reasonably priced.  The servers were down to earth and friendly.

My absolute favorite thing about Sparrow, besides the name, is the wall covered in paintings of white birds.  Again this is another point of potential trip out, but for me it just filled me with wonder,  and warmed my heart.

Such a nice vibe."}
{"text":"If there is one element of the Montreal food scene that I have truly ignored in my time living in the city, it is proper breakfast or brunch places. Based on my readings online, I have clearly been missing out on some fantastic options and as such, decided to remedy the situation. About a month or so ago, I started along this path by visiting The Sparrow on St-Laurent (near Maguire) in the Mild End district of the city with a friend.

Now, under normal circumstances, The Sparrow is a British gastropub which I clearly need to visit during evenings hours. The place has a great look and feel. The music selection during our meal was an amazing eclectic mix of soul, old rock, jazz which I hummed along to throughout the meal. The service was also quite quick and efficient despite the crowded restaurant (We arrived at opening hence the empty picture above... It filled up rather quickly afterwards) If you check the hours at the door, you would have no idea that they even do breakfast/brunch on weekends... It's not listed! However, they do amazingly creative and delicious fare.

What you see before you is house smoked pork, eggs, apple sauce, house made tater-tots and the most legitimate biscuit I've ever had outside of the southern US. Add to that a side of chorizo sausage &amp; a bourbon lemonade and you get a sense of the kind of food this pub serves up. My friend, on her end, ordered eggs benedict prepared superbly with asparagus and which used biscuits as a replacement for the English muffins. Across the board, the food was quite delicious.

If you're looking for a fun and slightly different take of the typical breakfast/ brunch meal, The Sparrow is great choice to try. Note that they only take cash, so be prepared accordingly.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful place to go solo/date/friends for dinner and/or drinks!  Great ambience, you can still hear yourself talk, and a great place to meet and mingle!"}
{"text":"Attention: i'm reviewing this as a cocktail bar rather than a brunch place. The waitress was chatting with friends for over 45 min before serving us. No one seems to care about our existence despite the fact that the place was almost empty at 11pm on a saturday night. Another place that 'lives up' its stereotype of plateau mile-end ;) It proves truly that \"putting a bird on it\" really works! #portlandia"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch experience!

I am a big brunch person and this definitely met my expectations.  Went a lil before 11am, had bar seating right away.  The place was full with a line.  I enjoyed the bar seating alot.  The waiters were very personable and quick with service too.  We had the Eggs Royale (eggs florentine with smoked salmon) and baked eggs with mushroom.  Both dishes were excellent.  We also ordered a side of Bubble and Squeak (somewhat like a pan-fried mash potatoes/ home fries-like).  By the time we were done with our meal, the line was outside the door. 

I would definitely go back to The Sparrow during my next Montreal trip and highly recommend it to anyone visiting there.  Great way to start the day with amazing food and the most friendly service!  Not to mention, love the old-time decor of the place."}
{"text":"My favorite watering hole in town, hands down.  Just not on a Friday nor Saturday night, but that's fine.  It can get very crowded and busy, but that's fine.  The owner (Murad) personally makes sure that all of the bartenders can make cocktails properly. 

My first time there, I ordered my first martini, ever.  With gin, and dirty.  The barman was a new face, and the owner was right there.  As it was not too busy, he took the time to personally show the barman the Sparrow way of making a proper dirty gin martini and it was delicious.  

Every concoction be it a classic (Manhattan, Rusty Nail, Bulldog, etc.) has one downside: it is so good that you down it so fast that you need to order another right away.  The sparrow-specific cocktails are definitely also worth a try.

Having not yet tried the brunch, I have at least tried the \"pub grub\" which is deliciously crafted and very gobble-able as well.

Servers are prompt and professional with and amazingly easy on the eyes - which shouldn't matter; but it does ameliorate the experience on a superficial level at the least."}
{"text":"This place is hip, very hip. The food is a breath of fresh air in Montreal. I have eaten here at least a half dozen times and now the food is less fresh. Basically the menu is out of Gordon Ramsay's book fast food and his show kitchen knightmares. That being said, for the price this place is great."}
{"text":"You will NOT regret this brunch! seriously one of the best brunch places in town. I got the Buckwheat Pancakes - super soft, and the fruits on top were far from basic. The presentation was beautiful too! My BF got the steak and eggs, and it was really good as well. Also, the steak portion is quite generous, which is kind of hard to find. Will be showing this place to a lot of friends and fam for sure :)"}
