{"text":"We had a fantastic Saturday breakfast - Rum Chata french toast, walley & eggs, and cajun steak eggs benedict. We stayed for the meat raffle - 40 winners! Very friendly and a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite local bar. They have completely remodeled the inside and it has a really nice, fun atmosphere. They serve a great and reasonable breakfast and make really good burgers. They have some decent specials and game time fun as well. I've never done it but they have \"naughty bingo\" every few months. The owner is a nice lady named Debbie and she often tends bar. We watched a the badger game last weekend and they served Jell-O shots with every touchdown. They seem to have regulars who are friendly as well. 
If you are driving down hwy 51, I'd recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding breakfast. We had the walleye & eggs, cap'n crunch french toast, and eggs benedict, and everything was really really good. I don't know how the cook could manage all the tickets with such a small grill, but he did! The bartender kept checking in on us even though it was very busy, which is a major credit to her as a server. Great little bar, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place before, and then I read a review in Madison.com.  So on Sunday, I dropped by the Monona Farmers' Market to pick up some fresh veggies and a bouquet of flowers for the Mrs.  Then I headed South. The Nest is small and the parking lot was almost full. I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of coffee, and a loaded omelet, English muffin, hash browns with a scoop of gravy.  Oh, and of course I had to have a Bloody Mary. 

Friendly folks at the bar and behind the counter.  Coffee was fine, the omelet was huge and perfectly done, the muffin was tasty and OMG the hash browns with the gravy were just amazing!  I am a bit of a B&G snob, but this gravy was the best I have had in Madison.  

Oh, and the Bloody was so good, I really had to argue with the voice in my head that wanted a second one.  The touch of horseradish really made it special.  Did I give in to the voice?  I'll never tell. It's a long drive home!"}
{"text":"Changed cooks. Food quality dropping. No flavor and bones in fish. After 2 tries we're done. Don't ask for scrambled eggs! Top is what you get."}
{"text":"They serve a great breakfast at an extremely reasonable price. Bloody Marys are excellent too. Service was fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go...fun bartenders...Mary and Ashley....great breakfast..great cook....Naughty Bingo...meat raffles.  Great place to watch the game.  The owners care about the place.  Stop by if you are out that way."}
{"text":"Updated greasy spoon breakfast.  Had walleye, eggs, hash browns with onion and cheese ($10)Rumchata French toast (3slices $6) with optional free Capitan Crunch breading and biscuits and gravy ($6).  Good food, well prepared, great value, took our server a bit to first greet us but gave friendly and attentive service.  Since I live in sun prairie 30m away, I wouldn't rush back, but it was worth coming out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the last day of a trip to Madison. Walleye and eggs seemed such a good idea that all three of us ordered the same, and it was really fantastic: nicely fried fish and very generous portion sizes. The waitress sat down with us to chat about our visit to town, genuinely interested and engaging without being obtrusive. Absolutely coming back next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"At long last stopped in for the walleye and eggs breakfast..It was as delicious as advertised. Huge piece of fish,lightly breaded.Price reasonable,service solid.. Highly recommend! Hint:fish is probably big enuf to share."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and always walk away happy.  It is in the more rural area right on state road 51.  It doesn't look like anything extravagant from the outside which is part of it's appeal.  Inside the staff and customers are friendly, the drinks are strong and the food is awesome.  I have eaten the walleye twice for breakfast.  It is so amazing it doesn't need tarter sauce, comes with a ton of other food and makes an incredible meal!  The staff is great and Mary, one of the bartenders is the life of the place.  They have amazing bloody Mary's including one featuring the ever famous Mary's hot bottom vodka.  I highly suggest having one complete with the garnishes.  I have to admit I have not been here during their late night hours only for breakfast/brunch.  They do have some seating area outside and suspect they do live music in the evenings.  There are multiple TV's for viewing pleasure always with a game on.  If you are looking for a small town place with amazing food, even better drinks and a welcoming atmosphere make sure you stop at the Squirrel's Nest in McFarland!"}
{"text":"RumChata French Toast?!?!?!?!!?!?! This place is unbelievable! Great kinda towny local watering hole featuring the best french toast, I can't believe it has booze in it!"}
{"text":"Rumchata French Toast was amazing!!! My husband ordered the walleye for breakfast. We would return. Atmosphere was slightly weird because it was regulars and we didn't necessarily feel very welcome but that comes with the territory of a super small establishment like this. Only feedback is that the bartender seemed annoyed by us when we asked for silverware..."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast on the weekend!!!  This alone gives it 5 stars!  Although they recently upped the prices, they are still crazy reasonable!  Note that they do not serve breakfast during the week!  Walleye and eggs=yummy huge portions Biscuits and Gravy=spicy goodness Captain Crunch French Toast=Awesome!  Pretty darn good bloody Mary's as well!  I've had their burger, fried pickles, and fries....all average for this type of place.  Rough crowd and can be busy on the weekend.  Give this place a try on the weekend!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar in McFarland. Wonderful atmosphere and amazing \"Hot Bottom\" Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Tasty walleye, a yummy Bloody Mary and good service. But bring cash, or pay to use the ATM."}
{"text":"A little roadhouse bar with some great breakfast/brunch. The walleye and eggs, might be the best breakfast I've ever had.
Simple but absolutely delicious. Good coffee too. Tasted my friends eggs Benedict also excellent. The cook knows his stuff."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for breakfast and it is really good! The bar is pretty small so it can be challenging to get a table or seat at the bar. Breakfast is amazing!! You can't go wrong with anything you try. Drinks are also very tasty and great small town bar prices! The bartenders are all very friendly and make you feel like you are a regular."}
{"text":"Great breakfast on Sat or Sundays! Best egg Benedicts in the area. They have a special French toast that is to dye for too. Cheap place. They only take cash. The place is small and often quite busy. It's a hidden jem."}
