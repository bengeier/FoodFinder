{"text":"Amazing food & staff! Their guacamole, made from scratch right in front of our table, was so amazing, it was worth the $17. We had salad, fish tacos and beef tacos. All the food tasted so fresh & the staff treated the group of us like queens!"}
{"text":"We made reservations here since there was a lot of activity at the MGM Grand, as I am sure there always is.  We waited a few minutes to be seated in the bar area.  Was a little disappointed since we did make a reservation.  And being it was \"happy hour\" time, most of the patrons around us were \"happy hour\" partakers.  Our server was pleasant but the service was extremely slow.  We were almost done with our chips and salsa by the time he came over to take our order.  We knew we wanted to try the table side guacamole, so we ordered that and he ran away before asking or taking our drink order.  When he came back to take our drink order, he ran away again.  We were ready to order our entrees, but he literally could only take one order at a time.    The table side guacamole was very good.  A good amount of avacodos, onion, cilantro, tomatoes and salt. We ordered margaritas, mine was a frozen, prickly pear, and raspberry margarita on the rocks.  Both were very refreshing.  Since we filled up on chips and salsa and guacomole, we shared fajitas.  We had a chicken and shrimp combo.  You have the choice of flour or corn shell tortillas.  We got flour tortillas, and there was three small ones.  The shrimp was very good, and had a mesquite seasoning.  The chicken had some pink spots on it which kind of concerned me.    We needed to get to a show and was looking for our server to get the bill.  When he got to our table, we gave him a card, and he disappeared for a while.  When he finally came back he said the credit card machine was down so had to take a carbon copy of it.  However when I was walking out, I saw other peoples bills being delivered I saw their's were done the modern way.  I didn't have time to ask why my receipt was the old school kind. The next day we went down to the restaurant to ask if their machine went down last night, no one could give us a straight answer.  It was a little suspect if you ask me.  There are plenty better establishments to go to while in LV."}
{"text":"Had some military buddies coming into town. So me being the local wanted to find a place for us to watch the game and have a few drinks. I had put my bet in the sports book at the mgm so I thought I'd try this place. It wasn't too busy. So I walked up to the bar, but it seemed the heavy set white bartender was more interested helping the other white customers and completely ignored me. Maybe I didn't look rich enough. I ended up taking my buddies, one of who was being deployed that following week, and showed them a better time elsewhere. I will not be coming back here or gambling at the mgm casino altogether because of this experience. We don't make much money in the military, but we don't deserve to be treated like this. Definitely not friendly at the bar."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are two profiles on here but I posted to the other one... To reiterate this place is awesome! Check it out and it seems good for large parties. Lots of different \"atmospheres\" available in the same space. Food was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was great, but the service was AMAZING. Leo made it memorable and fantastic. Had the table side guac and the fajitas with margs. We will definitely be back time and time again and asked to be seated in Leo's section."}
{"text":"Just got checked into the MGM and needed a meal. It was a great way to start the vacation. The decor was really fitting. Lot of sugar skulls and Dia de los Muertos paintings which I love. Ok the drinks, I would recommend the top shelf margarita. I did not have one but was able to taste the one my husband owned and had instant drink envy.  For dinner.. I started with the ahi tuna ceviche which was so good! Creamy and very fresh with great flavor. I could have had 2 more dishes. For the main course I had carnitas and mushrooms again great flavor and with a white cheese crumble and chunks of mango. At the end of the meal my sister mentioned that this was my birthday trip.... they brought out flan with a caramel sauce and what I think was some sort of roasted nuts in chocolate (and yes he got the table next to us to helps sing Happy Birthday to me). I was ready to fall over. The service was great which also added to the enjoyment of the meal. I would say that if you are in the MGM to give it a try."}
{"text":"This is their first attempt at Breakfast/Brunch. They did a great job in being engaged with their customers. They forgot to update their business hours on yelp and it shows \"closed\", but I can assure you they are open.   Excellent place for breakfast/brunch!! Excellent service, entertainment, the ambiance is excellent, oh yeah and the food is great--what else could you ask for!?! The mariachi is top notch! If you are close by, stop by, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to dine in on Friday Cinco de Mayo. 2 Hispanic waiters were very rude and unprofessional. The food was good but very unfriendly staff members. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came for weekend brunch to get the bottomless bloody Mary's but at $29 you have to have 3 per person to make it worth it and we didn't even get our drinks before our meals arrived. My husband had to ask the bartender if we were going to get our drinks which had been sitting on the counter that whole time we were waiting, very frustrating. The food is average American Mexican food, nothing amazing but not horrible. Just basic flavors and basic choices. The service definitely needs some attention from management, for being at the MGM I would expect service to be the top priority. When our waiter saw my husband getting our own drinks from the bar, she didn't even bat an eye or apologize... Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"Limited menu. Bland and uninspired preparations. Massively overpriced given the lack of quality. They even charge $5 just for chips and salsa, and the salsa is basically blended tomatoes....and the basket of chips was basically the bottom of the drawer....all tiny broken pieces....and $5 for that?. The service is horrific. Extremely inattentive and slow, and one of the servers even had an attitude as if we were rudely interrupting their doing nothing in order to serve us....and it was a slow night. The only positives were the hostesses, who are friendly, attentive and efficient and the drinks are well prepared....so maybe Hecho En Vegas would be best served closing the kitchen, getting rid of the wait staff and just becoming a bar with the hostesses......otherwise, if they couch it as a budget fast food restaurant, then maybe the poor quality would be acceptable at $4 - $5 a meal. There are many extremely good Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Amazing !! From start to finish I was impressed.  Our server Dana was amazing, the food was amazing. I had the tableside guac which was sooooo worth the $11 and the enchiladas banderas everything was so great ! This will def be a regular spot for me every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing. While we intended to eat a Mexican dish, we were told about a special they had that night. Filet with asparagus,mashed potatoes and a split Maine lobster tail, each with their own sauce. So that's what we chose to with because it sounded amazing. We were sat right away at a table, we were waited on amazingly well. Excellent staff, excellent atmosphere, excellent food!  We WILL be choosing this restaurant for another meal during our stay. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Decided to not eat all day. Flew to Vegas and made our 9:30 reservations. The table side guacamole was good. Drinks were ok but very small and very expensive. Entrees were shrimp fahitas, and short rib burritos. Both were ok but nothing you couldn't get at any cheap mexican joints. Wait staff was top drawer."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for making our decision to skip your establishment so easy Friday evening. Telling us and number of other couples that there was a 20 minute wait when your eatery was less than half full was a stroke of business genius! I can only assume that the rest of our dining experience woud have been just as dismal had we chosen to \"wait\"."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food was amazing! I had the beef pizza so good I never thought I would be able to eat it on my own but it was so good I did! Haha The Guacamole Is to Die For Amazing! Service was great! Will definitely be coming back :D"}
{"text":"i really liked this place. i had the 3 enchiladas sample with beef,chicken and pork. they were excellent. the guacamole was really good too. Good service. my friend had the tacos but he said he wasn't impressed. But who goes to a mexican restaurant and orders tacos anyways? my food was delicious and i would definetely come back."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever! Super expensive and the portions are ridiculously small! The carne asada burrito tasted so bad! I even had stomachache the entire night for eating here! Please do yourself a favor and go eat somewhere else where you will enjoy and your money will be worth it!"}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends went out on the town one evening and decided to give this new restaurant a chance since we were craving Mexican food. Let me just say it was a disaster! First we started of with table side guacamole made by a lady named Trini. She was very rude and unfriendly. I didn't think you could mess up guacamole but it was just very salty and not very tasty.   Our server was Daniel and pardon my French but he was a douche. He was not very informative about the menu and rolled his eyes at us quite a few times. His personality was just very rude. The only standout of this place was Eric who delivered our food and even came back to check on us even though he wasn't our server. He's the only one who seemed to care about our table. Definitely keep Eric but the other 2 you could do without. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas over the Memorial Day weekend my party and I were searching the strip for some Mexican food at about 10 o'clock at night. We found this place inside MGM and decided to give it a shot. The chips comes with two kinds of salsa, red and green (the green was delicious!) and all of our orders came out quickly. All of our food was delicious! The taco salad was HUGE and also unlike anything I've seen before. The tortilla was very flight and flakey, yum, and it wasn't in a typical bowl shape...but instead more of like a giant taco shell! What I would say really pushed this place from a four star to a five was our server. I wish I had gotten his name because he was FANTASTIC. Extremely friendly, made us laugh, was always checking on us and filling up our waters. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge margaritas. Chips warm and service fantastic. Moderately priced. Very much enjoyed dinner here!"}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed by this place in MGM. We wanted to eat somewhere different and worthwhile for our first night in Vegas and chose Hecho. Customer service was terrible. The menus are gigantic, size wise that is definitely not in terms of the options. Tables were uncomfortable. We ordered some enchiladas and quesadillas as well as sangria. Both entrees were underwhelming and the $12 sangria was basically a cup of ice with ginger ale. I've had better Mexican food at Chipotle. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculously overpriced.   We had reservations to Ka at 9:30 on Saturday and before the show we decided to stroll the MGM grand to find a nice place to eat. My date wanted some Margaritas and we saw this place so we decided to give it a shot. When we were seated the server came and gave s a menu and we couldn't believe the prices,  $14 for a taco salad with either shredded beef, shredded chicken, or pork. I asked the server how much would it cost to upgrade to carne asada and he said $6, so I told him that I would keep looking at the menu and he gave me a disgusted look, My date saw the prices on the tequila shot and they were ridiculous, I know shots can be pricey but this place was over the top we could of walked to the liquor store and bought a whole bottle of cabo wabo for the price of one shot of cabo wabo uno.  They gave us chips and salsa, the salsa was not bad but the chips were stale and hard, so far I was not impressed,  We settled for appetizers instead we ordered the chimi surprise which were 3 mini chimis which was ok, my date had the street tacos which were passable at best and for that it was nearly $30. I am used to authentic Mexican food and this place is not that, I would of been better off eating at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, which can be pricey but at least the food would be worth it. This place is for sure a fail ."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. Salsa is kinda weak. Black beans are good. Ate at the bar for quick servicio amigo."}
{"text":"My husband and choose to sit at the bar and have drinks and apps for dinner. The bartender made a couple of suggestions and they were spot on. Yummy you have to try the jalepino popper and shrimp wrapped in bacon oh my stars I'm going back for more. The margarita was spot on. Nice ambiance prices as expected service perfect."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Ordered the Tamale Platter, excellent. Also, the dos enchiladas verdes were delicious. Chips were fresh and salsas were tasty.  I loved this place, great atmosphere and our server Benjamin was Great!  We will be returning next time we are in Vegas.  highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a local who was staying at the MGM for a concert and we ate here beofre the concert.  We wanted to eat at  another restautna but hte wait was crazy long.  By chance we walked up tp Hecho en Vegas and sat right at the bar.  Was so glad we ended up here.  They have a great menu that incluede many Gluten free options.  Ceaser was our server and was amazing.  Foo"}
{"text":"Well let me just say what a challenge it was to get food there because we did not get any we sat down we told them we were extremely hungry so they brought us a bag of crackers we ordered the clam chowder and a turkey burger 40 minutes later they explained to us they had forgotten to put our order in and they were willing to buy us two beers terrible and believable we left did not even drink the beer we are still hungry in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is in the space that used to be Diego's in the MGM grand. We were impressed by the service (knowledgeable and friendly), flavors (traditional Sonoran) and overall value. It's hard to find a family meal in a strip hotel these days that's good quality but doesn't set you back well over $100. Hecho is just opening and so they are working a few kinks out, but don't miss the table-side prepared guacamole and / or their ginormous nachos!"}
{"text":"Did not like the food at all. Was pretty surprised because Vegas usually has good food. Chips and salsa was not good. Had the chimichanga and it was dry. Service was ok. Would not go back."}
{"text":"This was such a great eating experience! We didn't plan on eating here, but we had to grab a quick bite before our show, and they quickly accommodated 12 of us! (6-6 seating). Our waitress, Dana, was SO quick and made sure that everyone's order was taken correctly. They were on top of filling our waters, which must've been about 10 times because we were so dehydrated from sitting by the pool all day. They were so nice and friendly, always asking how our food was. We pretty much all got the taco salad which was huge and delicious. Yes, they are a little pricey, but it is Vegas and it was actually really good for Mexican food!! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious and excellent service. When we say we were immediately brought fresh chips and two types of salsa. The table side guac was so good, they roll a huge cart over to the table and let you decide which ingredients you want and how much. The addition of cilantro in it was amazing. For dinner we enjoyed chicken fajitas (chicken was perfectly cooked, and served on sizzling skillet with veggies) and the short rib taquitos were on the appetizer menu but I enjoyed them as my entree. Absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"The food was very over priced and mediocre in quality. I've had better street cart Mexican. The service was super slow and the place was empty. I will never return. I'd rather eat fast food."}
{"text":"2 words.  food poisoning Husband and I visited Vegas at ate at Hecho on 5/27. We shared a carne asada .About 3 hrs after we ate we experienced severe gastrointestinal problems. My husband had non stop vomiting... so much that we spent that night and into the morning at a disgusting and dirty ER. We were bed ridden the next 2 days. Anyone else experience this?!!"}
{"text":"The table side guac is off the chain. All Fresh ingredients used. I'd definately come back to eat  here again. Thanks for the good time."}
{"text":"4 meals, only 1 was reviewed as good.  The guacamole was ok, not great.  They made the meal quickly for us so we could go to a show, so that was great.  Fajitas were overcooked and subpar compared to an On the Border.  Look, it just wasn't very good.  It served as sustinance, but not much more."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas twice a year and always stop here for one of Cesar's great margaritas. Cesar always remembers us and provides great friendly bar and food service. The chips and salsa are great,but the pork nachos are the best. Looking forward to our August trip."}
{"text":"This was decent, but felt like we were mostly paying the premium for being on the strip, not for quality of food. Acceptable, but with so many other options, I wasn't very impressed. The drinks were tasty, but the enchiladas I had were merely ok. Service was good, but the restaurant wasn't full at the time."}
{"text":"Overpriced and worst of all: in an efgort to make their taquitos \"fancy\" they failed to make them good. I opted out of an entree."}
{"text":"I have never loved going to dinner with my mother in law so much. She treated us to Hecho's and everything about the night was perfect. Excellent and attentive service. Spectacular food made exactly how asked for, and delicious appetizers! Any tourists that go through the MGM MUST stop and try it. The rolling guacamole cart (made directly in front of you) is to die for! Just a wonderful night with a full thanks to the Hecho's staff! Can't wait to eat it again!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant last weekend.  We had the WORST dining experience ever.  The hostess was extremely rude to us.  We had to wait 22 minutes to be seated when there was multiple tables open.  When we finally did get seated, the service was horrendous.  Empty drinks, empty chips, took forever to take our order...all while we watched the waiters mosey around while laughing and talking with each other.  There is no sense of customer service at this place.  When the food actually did come out it did not taste like the price suggested.  Please save your money and go get great food and even better service somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just reopened 11/28/17.  Had Tres Enchiladas.  I'm not normally a enchilada fan (burrito is my choice), but this trio was probably the best I've ever had.  All 3 were different and had excellent, distinctive flavors.  The beans and rice were very good also.  Rice was sort of spanish variety in look and taste, and the refried beans were quite good and flavorful.  We had outstanding service.  Took care of our every need and the manager was friendly, ask about our experience, generally cared, shook my hand, and was appreciative.  RARE these days indeed."}
{"text":"Great restaurant by far one of my favorite ones on the strip. Being a local you don't ever want to go to the major casinos, but being it was a date night we decided to go to hecho en vegas and it was the best choice because we had the best service by our server Saul.  He suggested the tastiest dishes and drinks for us to try. Once we decided on dinner he suggested fajitas so we went with his suggestion and by far the best meal I had in a long time. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends n family."}
{"text":"We usually don't eat Mexican food while on vacation since our hometown is filled with yummy Mexican dinning options. We were pleasantly surprised by the  quality and flavor of everything ordered by group. The white sauce in the tamales were too die for. I can't give Leo enough positive praise. He was prompt, attentive, efficient, friendly and helpful. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"I went there because they advertise that the chefs daughter has Celiac and they have an extensive gluten free menu.  I informed the server that I was celiac and he told me that I could not eat the chips because \"they have a big kitchen with lots of staff and anything could fall into the fryer\"??? The manager and chef came out and told me they could oversee my meal prep and could give me celery sticks to dip into the salsa instead of chips.  Even though they offered to make my meal, we left because I did not trust the kitchen staff who may have cross contaminated, put food items that were not gf with the gf items.  What is the point of offering a gluten free menu if your staff is not educated on cross contamination??? Also, many bulk food suppliers offer gluten free chips, tortillas etc. if you are a Mexican restaurant offering gluten free all over your menu...why not order some gluten free items to serve to your celiac patrons?  If you mention celiac and gluten free on your website, educate your staff or bring a group in to do so before plastering GF all over your menu!"}
{"text":"My group of 6 recently had a late lunch/early dinner at Hecho en Vegas. It was an off-time so we walked right in and were seated at a high-top table.   The service was prompt and on-top of our needs the entire time. As this was a pre-nap meal, the trip was food-only.  The complimentary chips and two salsas were delicious. The chips were crispy and the salsa verde had a great flavor. We ordered a side of guacamole for the table. They don't offer the tableside service that early in the day, but were able to offer a discounted pre-made guac. While not fresh, it was pretty good.   While ordering my dos enchiladas I asked if they could be made extra spicy. While they could not, our server brought out this banging habanero puree. It didn't taste spicy at first but it had a really hot after taste. My non-spice loving friends hated it but as a spice lover, I couldn't have asked for anything more. It had flavor and hotness at the same time.   My enchiladas came out with jalapenos on the top so did get that extra spice in addition to the habanero puree. I like the attention to detail my server had for my spice needs.   The enchiladas themselves (one chicken, one cheese both with crème sauce) were good but fairly standard. The dish came with rice and refried beans. My friend's came with black beans. I wish we were given the option as I would have gone with black beans.   There was a little confusion with the check. The dos enchiladas were $15 on the menu, however they charged $19 on the bill for the three orders for my table. They took it off the bill and blamed it on a glitch in the system. I wonder how often that's happened without anyone noticing.   Overall, Hecho en Vegas provided for a relatively quick, inexpensive and tasty Vegas dining option. I'm not rushing back on my next trip to Vegas, but it's a good casual dining alternative if you happen to be nearby and hungry."}
{"text":"Half as good as Elterito....but twice as expensive.....worst restaurant I ate at in vegas"}
{"text":"My friends got their dinners, but two of us still haven't. It's been about five minutes. Not sure what happened. But none of us at this table are happy. Margarita is decent but pricey. Don't think I'll be coming here again. Nor would I recommend this place to anyone else.  The chicken quesadilla was pretty good, though. So I guess if you can overlook the service problems, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved it. We had Dana who was absolutely fantastic. I asked if the cheese was pasteurized (pregnant) and she said yes but then when she came back she said she double checked with the chef just in case. Very sweet, great personality. Everyone recommended the table side guacamole, I was hesitant because it was $10.... for guacamole.. but it was totally worth it. I don't even usually eat guacamole but my husband and I devoured it. Both our dishes were great, I got the 3 different meat enchiladas and my husband got shrimp fajitas. Husband liked the tequila tasting as well.  Great place, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Place was fantastic! Wife has gluten allergy and stuff was marked well on menu and staff is very knowledgable and friendly."}
{"text":"While the food was amazing, I specifically told the front hostess and the staff that my wife was celiac and now dealing with a very sick woman who was glutened. I don't care if you have someone in your family who has celiac, if you can't train the staff on allergies, then don't pronounce yourself as gluten friendly. My wife is sick on our first day of a three day trip that we have been planning for over 6 months. She doesn't have a diet choice, this was a necessity."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was really slow for us. We were seated by the kitchen and our server was either too busy to give us proper service or just forgot us. We ate here as it was next too the concert hall. Someone came by and offered us free tickets."}
{"text":"Hosted my 17 person bachelor party in their private back room and it was incredible. Definitely definitely suggest doing a private menu/room for large groups. Absurdly attentive service, drinks were always coming, and the food was fantastic. We couldn't finish it all - soo much food and totally worth the price point."}
{"text":"This was the second mexican restaurant we visited while here. It is a bit pricey for what you get but that's what happens when you eat at a hotel restaurant. Great flavored salsas. Had the tres Carne enchiladas (shredded pork, shredded beef, and Carne asada) - couldn't pick a favorite between the three since they all were good. Rice was uneventful. Our server was great, very attentive and funny."}
{"text":"we had margaritas and 2 dishes. its pretty basic mexican fare. Not bad but nothing memorable. Pedestrian flavors at a pretty penny. With so many options in Vegas I def woudnt be back."}
{"text":"We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here with around 25 people and it was great! The food was tasty and kept coming, family style until everyone was full and then we had dessert! You can choose from set menus for large groups but we found they were also very accommodating for vegetarians and vegans in our party. And like a lot of other reviewers I don't really like guacamole, but the stuff from here is delicious!!  But the real star of the show was Leo who looked after us throughout the night. Flexible, warm, wonderful. He made everything so easy and lovely and managed our kooky and late family with grace and ease."}
{"text":"We ate here before going to Hakkasan with our group of 11 girls. It's reasonably priced delicious Mexican food with over the top service. The server was funny and very attentive. We had the table side prepared guacamole which was so good and u had the short rib taquitos that were so tasty."}
{"text":"I got the street tacos from the appetizer menu, ships and salsa (red and green) and a margarita on the rocks with Herradura and Gran Marnier ...delicious!!!  Javier, bartender, was super friendly and attentive. He took the time to tell me about the hotel and the MLife card.  Street tacos were good, they were packed in meat  yum yum!!! Chips couldn't be more crispy!!! Salsas was good, verde needed salt, but red was tasty. About $45 for all three things I order.   I'm a happy customer, Thank you Javier."}
{"text":"Of all the places we ate in Vegas these tacos were our favorite. Sat at the bar and the service was awesome. Carne asada tacos were excellent. Chips, salsa and guac were on point."}
{"text":"Dined two nights in row. Tale of two cities, first night made me want to come back, second night reminding me why I don't often   Eat Mexican. And the service matched each night perfectly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Paradiso tequila here and despite the wait staff 'double checking,' I have a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't what I actually ordered. I also had the ribeye, chile relleno and a number of different appetizers. The food was fairly tasty Mexican American fare, but nothing to write home about. The service was friendly and efficient though. All in all, a decent meal if someone else is paying, but it is hard to recommend given the number of different options available in Vegas."}
{"text":"In October my girls and I went to Vegas. One of our friends came out from New Jersey, while the rest of us from Southern California. After a concert in the MGM, we were starving. I worked my magic with getting my group of friends a table swiftly. We were seated at a big table and had prompt attention from our waiter. We promised to leave generous tips and be an enjoyable crowd of people. The food was delicious and well worth the price. I ordered the enchilada trio with all the fixings. My friends enjoyed their beverages, the fresh salsa and chips, and we left our plates cleaned with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian enchilada here and I was surprised to see that the vegetables that were used looked like frozen vegetables, the birds eye or green giant kind that comes in a frozen package.  They even had machine cut cubed carrots and lima beans, just what they used in frozen mixed vegetables from a grocery store.  I asked why the vegetables were like that?  The waiter told me \"unfortunately we don't use fancy vegetables in our food\".  Fancy as in, fresh?   Seriously?  I came to this place when it was Diego's and it was far better, I'm really disappointed with this venue and will not be back."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh. Skip.  I got the guac and thr fajitas. There was nothing slecial about either of them. But the guac was decent....or maybe i was hungry. The fajita rice was hard and the beans lacked flavor. Very underwhelming experience.  The margaritas were essentially juice. Womp. I came here with a group of 5 people and we all shared similar sentiment.  Its a pretty big space and because of the loacation i'm sure its always busy. But if I were you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was weird. The waiter IDed my sister because she ordered the margarita salad. The guac was too salty but they remade it and it was awesome! A little pricey but very yummy. We split the taco salad and nachos. The meat was so yummy! So much food!!!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Fresh guacamole made table side. Food was very good. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you happen to be at the MGM Grand. Service was attentive and friendly. We got the guacamole, which was a treat since it's prepared tableside. It tasted great even without the jalapeño. (We had to leave it out to fit our young child's palate.)   I had portobello fajitas. It was a good, filling amount of food, and the wood-fired portobello pieces were flavorful. The corn tortillas were piping hot and made the perfect wrap for the mushroom pieces, beans, pico de gallo and rice.   My son ordered a plain cheese quesadilla, which is off-menu, but they gladly made this kid-friendly dish. He liked it -- but how can you ruin tortillas and cheese, really?  We were all pleased with our dining experience! If you want a casual dinner at the MGM Grand, this is a great choice.   Note: they don't serve lunch."}
{"text":"We were staying in the MGM and looking for a decently priced place to eat for dinner and found Heche. From the pictures it appeared to be like a Pink Taco (which is our favorite in Vegas) so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was more like a 3 Margaritas and a little less authentic than I was hoping. The waitress was enthusiastic but lacked customer service as we didn't get our waters filled and service was slow even though it wasn't very busy.   The guac was okay, but not worth $13 for the small portion. The salsas were a little weird - the red one was a darker chipotle taste which I'm not a big fan of. Ordered the taquitos and nachos which were actually really good!   Good stop for a snack in your in the food court at MGM."}
{"text":"Five star review, solely because of the bartender Bobby! Honestly, showed us the ropes of this spot, MGM, and Vegas in general! We will be back just because of him. Highly recommend sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"There's 1 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back..I admit that the Servers and Hostesses were Very Professional, Polite, Attentive and Friendly but they get 2 stars for the food and beverage..our plates were Hot, but the food was Cold and had No Flavor whatsoever..and my Margarita was watered down and all I could taste was the Triple Sec..I suggest they get a new cook and bartender..one of the Worst meals I've had here at the MGM Grand"}
{"text":"We were big fans of Diego's, as it seems many on this site were, so we were sad to see it go but willing to try the new venue. It was decent enough. The service was excellent. The queso fundido was AMAZING with the mushrooms! I had enchiladas and my husband had a burrito and both were very good. I do miss Diego's mix of salsas and salts and think Diego's was a little more authentic, but this was good and we will be back. Much better than several other Mexican restaurants on the Strip."}
{"text":"Good service and great food just not great ambiance and very expensive for being near the food court at the MGM Grand. Huge portions and strong margaritas! Chips and salsa are not complimentary which is disappointing."}
{"text":"For the environment. The food is just ok. Kind of plain and boring. Service is just ok too. Basically nice environment. Sports bar feeling."}
{"text":"Eat here only if you don't have any other choice and if your starving from not eating for a whole week... I don't know if it's just today or every day is like this but you can get better tasting food and service from your local McDonalds!!! NO JOKE!!! Over priced, low quality, low taste... Just bad! I didn't have a good experience but your free to try, as for me, i will never come here again nor will I bring a friend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent Pollo con mole!! The service was excellent! Thank you Dana for great service!"}
{"text":"It's very hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas - especially good Sonoran style - but Hecho nails it. Being from Tucson, I'm very familiar with Sonoran style, and familiar with the family who partnered to open Hecho. The food takes me back home instantly. I especially enjoyed the enchiladas banderas. Prices are a little up there but not out of line for a Vegas restaurant. Overall, great place to enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the bartender was very nice.  We sat at the bar to save time and the service was quick.  It was a little pricey but definitely delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  We stopped here for dinner one night during a conference we were at the MGM for.  The food was amazing, service was great, and the guac is to die for!  It can get pretty busy so reservations are definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service. For vegas the prices weren't bad at all for 2 tacos and a drink."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this place since before it was Hecho En Vegas (I think it was Diego's before?). The food is good to very good, and the service is excellent. Nice atmosphere as well.  Great for those just-got-to-Vegas-tired-and-not-sure-what-to-eat nights!"}
{"text":"Had better. Food: so so. Drinks: watered down. Service from waiter: great. Service from managers: crap."}
{"text":"We were staying in the MGM and were rushing to watch Ka. We stumbled across this restaurant, when we were looking for a quick bite. It was not crowded at all. And it definitely wasn't a pace to go for a quick bite. Two of us shared an appetizer and an entree.  Appetizer - table side guacamole. The waiter came by our table and prepared guacamole in front of us using 7 ingredients. They gave us some freshly made nachos to go with it. I was amazed at the taste.  Entree - fajita bowl. It came with sour cream, fajitas, salsa, tortillas, beans, rice and guacamole. They were made so well that we couldn't stop eating it.  The portions were pretty huge for both of us. Glad we didn't order too much. The food was a little on the expensive side. But overall I enjoyed the good. Glad we came across this place!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my visit last weekend. Food was very good and service is always amazing.  I like that they give you different flavor salsa's.  Place is always clean.  A+ in my book.    This is a hidden treat in the MGM Grand."}
{"text":"Please bring back Diego's!!! Diego's used to be my hubby's & I's go-to restaurant when we stayed at MGM. It was so tasty and had amazing deals. My how times have changed! We live in San Diego, so we have the authority to critique Mexican food. Diego's was grub, but Hecho took ten giant leaps towards \"On the Border\" status, yuck.   We went to Hecho last night and ordered the following: $7 margarita, guac, wings, street tacos, and the tres carnes enchiladas. Pretty good happy hour deals.   The drink was standard in quality, but was served in a pint glass (not used to that). The guac was not table side, but looked fresh. It was ok, big chunks of avocado. The strange thing was, it had this funky effervescence. Some strange tingly sensation! (Maybe something to keep the guac from going brown when they made it ahead of time?) still edible, just weird. The wings were really good, I would recommend them. Thank goodness we got them or my poor hubby would not have been satiated. The three tacos were also pretty standard - nothing great. The meat was sub-par but, again, edible. They could use a special sauce or salsa. The street tacos are a fairly small plate as they don't come with beans or rice, FYI.   Finally, the tres carnes enchiladas - they were sad. The meats were carne asada (which tasted like jerky), shredded beef (which tasted like rope), and carnitas (which was actually really good!). The enchiladas were dry not only because the meat tasted like it was sitting in uncovered hotel pans for 16-18 hours but also because there was not enough sauce or cheese. For being one of the most hyped plates on the menu, it was just depressing.   Let me say that I really like the new decor and remodel. But I wish they remodeled the place and not the menu. When my husband and I left, we discussed the changes & I asked him, \"Don't you feel like we just left On the Border?\"    This place may satisfy some people who don't know guac about quality Mexican food - but this place, in short, is NO BUENO."}
{"text":"Went twice in the last two days. Dinner had the table side guacamole fajita and quesadillas. Food was great so was the wait staff. Asked to try the two sangria's and liked both but have to rave about the white sangria. The sangria was a big reason we went back again sat at the bar with bartender jarrod who it turns out made the recipe. It is a must have  don't miss it if in Vegas. while sitting at the bar we also had the nachos with beef a great snack before heading out for the night. If you are near the MGM you should try this place out"}
{"text":"With an out-of-town, flight attendant friend laying over in Las Vegas and staying at the MGM, I suggested Hecho for dinner having heard and read amazing reviews.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  A reservation was made for 6pm, we arrived about 10 minutes early, were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and were immediately taken to a table.  As soon as we were seated, a very friendly woman named Veronica offered us water and menu suggestions.  She advised that Chris, our server would be with us shortly.    When Chris arrived at the table, he offered suggestions for both our meals and beverages.  While we were deciding on our entrees, we ordered the chips and salsa appetizer that comes with guacamole made tableside. Daniel made the guac exactly as we asked and it was delicious.   When Chris returned, we placed our orders.  We both chose Enchilada meals. The foods arrived very quickly and was presented beautifully.  The food was amazing!  We ordered dessert - Tres Leches and Churros, both were perfectly portioned and also delicious.    The moment we walked in, we were impressed. From being greeted with a smile and seated immediately by the hostess, to the prompt attentive service of our server Chris and his assistant Veronica, and our guacamole maker Daniel this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas.  Thank you Hecho and staff! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here during our stay in Vegas and weren't happy with the service.  Our waiter Cris was impatient while we were waiting to order.  When we asked what kind of fish is in the tacos, he said \"fish\". We asked if the fish has scales, he replied, \"all fish have scales\". Eventually he told us the name of the fish and it is similar to shark...not fish nor has scales. We found this information on our own because he didn't think it was important.  We asked due to dietary restrictions that one of our guests had. We go to Vegas often but definitely will not go to this place.  The food was good but not a fan of the service or lack thereof."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Some of the best salsa I have ever had - different from most Mexican spots. Great guacamole as well as margaritas as well!"}
{"text":"On our latest trip to Vegas and having a craving for Mexican, the Wife and I decided to check this place out. The food was 4-5 stars, but the service was more like a 2-3. So I settled on a 4. Like I said the food was good-the wife had the nachos with beef and I had the steak fajitas. It was soooo good. We even enjoyed the chips and salsa ahead of the meal.  Our waiter was either too busy or not sure on how often to check back on us.   I would try this place again since the food was so amazing but would hope to get a different server."}
{"text":"Missed our reservation at Bouchon due to nightmarish traffic.  Walked in seated and greeted immediately.  Ordered drinks: Iced Tea There is a name for this (Margarita & Beer)  Food: Salsas (Tomatillo & Fire-Roasted) Table-Side Guacamole The One & Only Combination The Tamale Temptation  Guac was good. Tomatillo salsa was fantastic. Short-Rib Taco in the Combination was great.  Good service. Solid food.  It works when you don't have plans."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with with some family and we were not disappointed! Not only did we have a great time but it was a great memory I'll always remember.   First off the atmosphere was nice you got a true Mexican restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and he made sure we weren't missing anything. To start off we ordered the guacamole and I was very surprised to find out that it is actually made right in front of you and can be however spicy you choose. The food came out quick and it looked, and smelled delicious. I ordered the steak fajitas and if you ever stop by I highly suggest you order them because they were delicious.    If you ever stay in Vegas and crave some Mexican food you try Hecho out. It's great for families but it also has a nice \"fancy\" feel to it. I'm definitely going next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We really like this Mexican restaurant. It wasn't really busy so we had our doubts. Guacamole was really good. The tacos and burrito presentation was very nice. Both of the salsas were excellent."}
{"text":"I came here about two weeks ago. The food is a little pricey but what do you expect you're in Vegas. Anyways the restaurant didn't open till 4:30. So my husband and I sat at the bar and waited into it open. I believe the bartenders name was Sergio. He made me and my husband the best Cadillac ever. We finally got seated and all the staff members were super nice and friendly. Our waiter was super cool and friendly and knew his stuff. The food was legit and tasted good. I would definitely come back to this place when I go back to Vegas. But just be prepare to spend some money because it's not cheap."}
{"text":"In the MGM complex. Long wait for i'd say 3 out of 5 star food. Then we noticed others order a drink at the bar and slide into a table when someone leaves. They will then clean the table and take your order. No wait that way."}
{"text":"I loved this spot!! I'm a Vegas local and was looking for a good restaurant inside MGM before a show - Hecho was perfect.  The crowd can get a little rowdy and touristy, but the delicious food and amazing service more than make up for that.  We got server Leo and he held true to previous reviews I had seen about him - HE'S THE BEST! So attentive and friendly.  Table side guac is fire and the fish tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Skip it! So over priced for absolutely below average food. Starting with the $6.50 for your basket of chips and salsa.  $15 for a beer and blah fajitas for $30...and not big enough to share."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers after an event in the conference center. We were late for our reservation, but they we're super accommodating! Our server, Leo, was amazing! Super fun and attentive service. He was phenomenal! I ordered the fish tacos and they were really good-- would definitely recommend them... and Leo!"}
{"text":"Our server was EXCELLENT. In fact, service at Hecho en Vegas was stellar. Our server had a great sense of humor, checked in frequently, divided our check (for a large party), and delivered our orders quicker than expected. We were never lacking for chips and salsa. The manager stopped by and checked on us too. I loved the service and there is nothing that they could have done better.  The atmosphere at Hecho was vibrant, fun, and clean. There were many rooms and sections that provided various levels of privacy (or not). Our section felt mostly private. We could easily hear one another talk, but it wasn't SOOOO private that it was awkward. Spot on Hecho!  It's the food that really squashed my opinion of Hecho. I hardly ate my mushroom fajita and left hungry. This was the issue: the food flavor was enhanced with lots of salt or something. I tried to get the healthiest thing on the menu but I still felt as if I was doing my body a disservice. M felt the same way about her food.  I was also disappointed by the drinks. I love mixology, so the drinks at Hecho were too main stream for me. I would have liked a non-tequila cocktail OR even something with mezcal (a smokey kind of tequila).  If I were paying for service and setting, then Hecho fit the bill. But, to be honest, I was also wanting food. It is pretty disappointing when you leave a restaurant hungry (and thirsty) and having to spend even more money at another restaurant for more food and a cocktail."}
{"text":"I'm a local here and was going to see ka at MGM grand so I decided to try this place. So I Love Mexican food and despite the mixed reviews thought I'd give it a try so the table side guac was amazing ! Its 14 bucks but there's plenty to share and all the way worth it. Super flavorful and you can customize the heat and ingredients if you like !   Now my Carne  Asada tacos ummmm not so much they were just ok I've had better for less ,didn't like the \"pico de gallo\" which was huge chunks of tomato and long silvers of onion (ew) but they weren't bad I wouldn't order them again. 2 tacos for $20 bucks cmon oh yeah you get bland rice and beans #bye ! But MgM can't be cheap so I wasn't surprised at the high prices.  I also enjoyed a Cadillac margarita $18 bucks and it was Delish plus the chips and salsa! Yes! Service excellent I'll go back for margarita , chips green salsa (the red roasted one left a bitter burnt taste in my mouth ) and guac! I heard the queso was great too but I didn't go that far!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this restaurant.  The enchiladas and guacamole were excellent!  The differentiator was the service, though.  Everyone from the hostess to the waiters were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"First time here since they opened at the MGM. Food was very fresh and tasty. I didn't want to have a too heavy meal at late night, I picked light nachos and chicken tortilla soup. It was excellent. Nachos was hot crispy but topping was cold and fresh. I don't know how they did it but I couldn't stop eating nachos and fresh made salsa/ sauce.. service was wonderful, food is little bit price but as we know, it a location.. comes with a  price tag!! Absolutely, I'd like to come back again!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and tasted like microwave food! Service was really good but the food gets one star."}
{"text":"My husband and our other couple friends sat at the bar. Cesar was our server and bartender. He was very knowledgable n friendly. We came back the following day because  he made us feel so comfortable n memorized our drinks. Jarred was also very friendly & talked to us about the drinks/menu. We would definitely recommend  this place to our friends  n relatives."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner here a couple of nights ago. I'm astounded at all the positive reviews, because the food was incredibly mediocre.  Both my husband and I got enchiladas (I had beef with red sauce, and he had the three enchilada sampler). Meals came with refried beans and rice. It wasn't awful, it just didn't taste great. No seasoning, the meat was kind of tough, and it was just super bland.   My husband ordered mezcal (they have about five different varieties on their drink menu), but the server was really confused about why he just wanted to drink it neat, and asked him a few times whether or not he meant \"mix it into a margarita.\" No. So then they brought it out in a champagne flute, which was odd.  I got a drink (I think it was called Better than Bourbon). It was mezcal with lime, mint, and agave. All I could taste were the mint and agave. It was almost too sweet for me to even drink, and if there was actually alcohol in it, it was a minuscule amount. I couldn't taste any smoky mezcal in there at all, which was a disappointment. Not worth it for what they are charging.   I've given two stars: one because they do have high chairs and are accommodating to little kids, and another because they do have gluten free options, and my husband didn't get sick from eating the food (he has Celiac disease).   We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 very hungry tourists.  When we arrived we had no wait time and were seated immediately.  The place looks very clean with one exception.  There was a bird flying around in the restaurant.  Yes, I said, \"bird.\"  We spent the next few minutes watching it fly around and a few other hungry tourists noticed it and left.  We should have left with them...  We wanted the table side guacamole but were told that service was not available.  Okay???  So, two of us ordered the Carna Arsada tacos and we were surprised when we only received 2 tacos with our meal...  (wtfreak right?).  My wife and daughter in law ordered the tamales.  Two were bland and the other was very good.    My grand kids ordered from the kids menu...  Wait for it...  They do not have a kids menu!   Yes, (wtfreak again) so they ordered chicken strips and fries.  Anyways, long story short.  This place was okay but we will not be eating here again.  All in all the food was mediocre to say the least.  If you are wanting authentic Mexican food this is not the place to eat.    PS:  Please bring back the original \"Diego's Mexican Restaurant.\""}
{"text":"I had the Beef Chimichanga and it tasted like Chinese fried rice wrapped in a tortilla that absorbed the taste of a frier that has not had the oil changed in a while."}
{"text":"Top 3 best Mexican restaurant for me in Vegas. Freshly made guacamole right in front of you with your choice of heat, pozole here is the bomb.com. Visit this place every time i visit Vegas, recommend it to everyone it's a must stop."}
{"text":"The table side guacamole was really good and so were the fish tacos we also got their new drinks they have inside the frozen pineapples which Were excellent and don't forgot about the deserts"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. From the chips and salsa to the entrees, everything we had was amazing. I had the carnitas and mushroom tacos and the tacos are pretty big. They give you two corn tortillas for each taco. Our server was great and I had a glass of the moscato d'asti and it was delicious. The salsa they give you is really good and we ate so many chips!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced, and edible but not outstanding. The service was absolutely terrible. If you go, check your bill. We were charged for guacamole that we didn't get, charged the wrong (higher!) price for 3 out of 4 drinks (my short-pour wine was also $6 overcharged), and beware that when they \"offer\" chips, unlike almost every Mexican restaurant, they charge another $5, but don't tell you till the bill comes. The salsa was so terrible we ate our $5 chips plain. And when we asked for separate checks they took an attitude. No water refills. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"I love this place! We wanted so good Mexican food and that's what we got! There was no wait and the waiter was very attentive. We order margaritas and it was made perfectly. They gave us chips with red and green salsa which both had a lot of flavor. I loved the green one. We both got carne asada burritos. They are alittle expensive the burrito was $26 and it doesn't come with rice or beans but it is big and definitely filling. The meat inside the burrito was perfect and they definitely didn't skimp on the meat. The margaritas were really tasty and strong which is the perfect combo"}
{"text":"Dana, our waitress from Hawaii was very friendly and made the night a lot of fun.  Food was exceptional, better than expected.  Churu's were the best we have ever had."}
{"text":"If you're at the MGM Grand, this is a fun place to grab a drink and some Mexican food. Typical Mexican restaurant menu. The quality of the food and margaritas is good. The guacamole is amaze balls.  Because of the setup of the restaurant, there's a lot of foot traffic with people walking by so it's a great place to people watch. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Diner Beware! The food and drinks were good. I write this review because our bartender, Cesar, tried to up-charge our bill. The tab came in the black carrier with the itemized bill, totaling $74 for our drinks, food and tax. I handed him the credit card. When I went to sign and add in tip, our bill increased to over $96. Noticing a $25 increase, I asked to see the itemized bill again.   He said he double charged us for our salads; however, it is rare an establishment adds items after a bill is established, when nothing else is ordered and he fail to produce a itemized check when it came time to sign. In addition, he did not apologize for the mistake.   The idea of a server taking advantage of the diner is appalling. I do not see myself or any of the folks traveling with me returning to this restaurant due to the dishonest service."}
{"text":"Had Dana as our waitress outstanding service had fajitas shrimp and chicken incredible ask for extra tortillas. Tortillas soup very good and burrito is enormous bring an appetite.  One of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Make a reservation this place is crazy busy and you can make reservation on yelp. Great job by entire staff."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. However, let me tell you, this was when Hecho En Vegas was called Diego. I went to dinner here with my family and noticed the name change, but assumed the food was the same...WRONG. First off, we had to stand around and wait over 45 minutes to be seated. I know Saturdays must be busy, but the wait was way too long for the quality of the food. When we were finally seated, our order was taken after a while and it took them forever to bring us our food. I mean, another hour or so. By the time they brought us guacamole, we were done with the chips and were starving. The food arrived and it was very small portions for the most part, compared to how it used to be. The enchiladas were my favorite when they were Diego's. That's the reason I came back as well as for the service. Needless to say, the change was for the worst. Everything was different and didn't compare to how it used to be. The service was nothing special and was super slow. I was extremely disappointed in the change. By the end of the night we were all just ready to leave and waited another 30 minutes to get the check so we could leave. We were there for about 3 hours and most of that time was spent waiting. None of us were happy about the change. I will not be returning. Bring Diego's back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was blah, no flavor, get better Mexican takeout in my NY neighborhood.  Bar woefully understaffed, I felt a little bad for the bartender as he scrambled all night.  Music provided by a DJ was great!  Too bad it was blaring loud - so loud I couldn't hear the people around me and wanted to escape ASAP.  Not sure if this place is aiming to be a bar, restaurant, or nightclub.  Too bad, the renovated space is hip and the location good.  Better choice for Mexican at Tacos and Tequila in the Luxor or Yolo in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Ask for Caesar if you love taquila and want to enjoy some taquila tasting. Leonardo was our waiter and gave us the full taquila experience.   Try the mini chimichangas and definely ask for prickly pear catus margarita!"}
{"text":"I must say, this was a really good choice for both food and \"people watching\" in MGM Grand... The hostess that helped seat us was very nice and made small talk with us, which we thought was very neat... All too many times you get those girls/guys that just point to your table and give you a menu... This girl had character...   At first glance, the menu can be a little large but it helps provide many different Mexican dishes...  I went for the 3 taco appetizer as I was on a \"liquid diet\" and it was good. The tacos were small and very street-taco like... I was content with the size and with the taste. I had a chicken, pork, and a beef taco and all of them were good...  Now for my main course, I had a drink called something very clever and I can't remember it... It was basically a margarita with a beer in it... It had a cool name and it tasted great.   All in all, our experience at Hecho En Vegas was really fun and we got to see several people getting escorted inside from the pool and kicked out on to the strip, I'm guessing... It was a ton of fun watching all of the drunk people... Oh, chips and salsa are free, and they really help when people watching..."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked by this place 7 or 8 times, and finally decided to try it one night when we felt like the walk to the Luxor for Tacos & Tequila was going to take too long (I was getting hangry, and food needed to be acquired ASAP).  We had been laughing about the serious lack of customer service we had been receiving all over Las Vegas, but when we came to Hecho, we were really please with the hospitality we received.  Roberto was our server and he was awesome.  I got the Hecho Casa margarita on the rocks, my hubs got a shot of Don Julio and a Modelo Especial.  We got the table side guac, and it was amazing!  I worked in a Mexican restaurant for 3 years, so I am pretty picky about my guac.  We asked for it to be on the mild side, and it was heavenly.  We split the steak fajitas (also amazing) and they gave us flour and corn tortillas since we preferred different types.  The steak was perfect, really juicy and tender.    We had been thinking that the guac and fajitas may not be enough food, and we were planning on getting desert from the froyo place outside Hecho, but we were both so full that we didn't have room.    This was the best meal and best service we had in Vegas in the last 2 trips that we have made, and we will def be coming back again when we come back to Vegas in December.  Also, for one appetizer, one entree, 2 beverages and a shot, the price was only around $68... Which was pretty cheap compared to the other places we ate and what we got for that price.     When we left, every person that we passed said goodbye, and thanked is for coming.  It was a nice change from the other places we had been."}
{"text":"I have been here for happy hour margaritas and appetizers two years in a row. Both visits were great. The service at the bar was exceptional and the food was much more traditional than what I expected. This isn't tex mex, people - the flavor is much more fresh and I always feel great after leaving and ready to continue my vegas tyrants. Our bartender was very friendly and maybe a bit too concerned as to whether we were enjoying the food and drinks; but that would probably be an excellent aspect to someone else. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years, great food and drinks, ask for the 702 HOT Sauce. This is the craziest hottest hot sauce you will ever I mean EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can mess up Mexican food, but this place succeeded. Food is not good. Service was amazing though. Super friendly and inviting staff. However if your rice and beans aren't even good then there's no saving this place."}
{"text":"First of all... Great Service!! Our server was Leo and he was amazing. Knowledgeable and friendly! The food is top notch. Prices are worth it! I had the Grande Margarita and it lasted past the meal. Trust me... I can drink a Margarita. It was excellent. I'm staying at The MGM Grand next time just because of this food!"}
{"text":"Super nice bartenders, good service at the bar, but it's just on-the-Strip prices for something you could get for cheap at a little taco shop. Given the location, they have to charge a lot, but you're just not really going to get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Small portion for the money.  Tortillas were hard and cold.  And our server was too busy flirting with 60 something old ladies.  He didn't even offer to refill my soda.  I even had to go find him to pay.   1 star is for the ok food.   Service would get a zero"}
{"text":"Wife and I were on vacation in Vegas. We come here every year. We do lots of eating, lots of gambling, lots of partying, and of course lots of sleeping.  We always stay at the M GM.  While walking through their restaurant and food court area on the ground level, we noticed that the Mexican restaurant called Diego's was no longer there. In its place, was another Mexican restaurant called Hecho en Vegas.   Now, usually when I see a restaurant replaced by a similar restaurant, it kind of is a turn off. It seems like they replaced apples with apples.    We had been to the now defunct Diego's before, and it wasn't that great. It was overpriced, under portioned, and they never actually seemed to be open to serve their full menu. It was always happy hour appetizers pretty much every time we tried to go there.  We decided to give this new place a chance, hoping that it was completely different from the original Diego's.  Believe me, it definitely was. The service was excellent, our waitress knew the menu very well, and the food came out fairly quickly.   Instantly, I noticed that this was not your traditional Mexican food. It wasn't super greasy, it wasn't super salty, and it wasn't heavy-handed with the seasoning. Everything was very delicate and almost seemed sort of like a Mexican version of fine dining cuisine.  We were pleasantly surprised. I got steak tacos with some side dishes, and the wife got a steak Mexican salad and also had some appetizers. Everything was fresh and tasty.  It was a bit on the pricey side, but that is pretty much what you can expect when you're eating in one of the major resorts on the strip. We felt that our food was so good that it was worth every penny.  Bangin' food. Can't go wrong with Hecho en Vegas."}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food catering for people w hypersensitive pallets. Ah! That's right! It's the MGM! That speaks volumes. With all the people milling around one would think they would step it up a notch w the food scene. Au contraire. Ate w a group of people and we all thought the same. Nothing i would run back for but the margaritas were good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a long time! The homemade guacamole was EXCELLENT! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Well well well. This was very yummy. I had the chicken fajitas and hubby had carne asada tacos. Service was outstanding. Chocolate tres leche desert was so so good. Guacamole was made at the table. Fresh chips that were warm"}
{"text":"Hecho en Vegas is not your traditional Mexican food. It's a bit \"kicked up.\" Some will like it and some will not.  My favorite part is the bar and bartenders. Perhaps I'm bias toward this location because of my old friends behind the bar. I love the tequila flights and Mojito's (raspberry, blueberry and tequila). Is tequila a flavor?  I'll return because I'm a Mojito freak and like the \"off the beaten path\" location. Yes, yes, and the bartenders."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The service was very bad. Rather than listing all the specifics let me just say that it was bad enough that it ruined the experience. I would try it again but never on a Saturday night when there's a big show at the MGM. Maybe when it's less busy it would better."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Portions are big and the food is very well prepared. Exceptional Mexican food. Service was top notch."}
{"text":"My experience here was mixed.  After eating dinner else where, a group of us came here for drinks.  Our waitress from Hawaii was excellent!  Nothing but good things about her.  We ordered 3 large beers and a pitcher of sangeria for six of us.  They asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  Little did we know this restaurant charges for chips and salsa.   I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges 10 dollars for 2 baskets of chips and 4 salsas.  To me that's really weird.  Isn't it traditional for Mexican joints to bring at no charge?  Let Along charge ten bucks. I strongly believe the servers should inform customers of this charge."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a yummy place to eat while staying at MGM. And after taking a walk around we saw Hecho. It looked like the people in there were enjoying the food so we decided to try it. I'm glad we did. We were seated in their \"patio\" section which was nice to people watch and the chairs were comfy. Our waitress Maria came and asked for our beverages and she was prompt in returning with them. Then our main server Leo came by and introduced himself. He was one the best servers we've ever had. Leo was friendly, knowledgable and all around great guy. He recommended an amazing margarita which did not disappoint. And we decided on their table side made guacamole and split chicken and shrimp fajitas. Both were delicious. Leo was very attentive with our drinks and anything else we needed. Definitely would go back and would recommend this restaurant to friends and would say to ask to be in Leo's section. If you want great service then he's your guy."}
{"text":"We dined here on Cinco de Mayo thinking it would feature something special for this Mexican holiday, but it did not. This was a very average restaurant with higher prices than could be expected for routine food. Service was not really attentive. The chips and salsa was very good, though not complimentary even with cocktails. I had some fish tacos - they were good but miserly with the fish. My wife had some kind of a salad which she thought was just o.k. Try to sit along the outer sections because people watching at the MGM Grand is much more interesting than the food sitting in front of you.."}
{"text":"Leo was our server and he was so nice and so accommodating. I'm vegan and they had delicious options for me and also made sure my food didn't come in contact with any dairy or meat. I also have 2 friends with celiac disease and they make sure all of their gluten free options were cooked separately and safe. Every single worker was so nice with a smile on their face. The food we had was great and the guacamole was a must have. If I could give them 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!  I'm having an event here and one of our attendees doesn't eat spicy food and they served her a tray with all of the appetizers without their spicy sauce. Super awesome and cool!  Big thanks to Dan Dixon, Jose and Saul"}
{"text":"So we went here for dinner and we thought the food would be really good, but we were disappointed. So we ordered an appetizer and their fresh guacamole; the queso fundido and the chicken quesadilla was amazing so we couldn't wait for are main entree. The entree looked really good but as soon as we tasted it they weren't that good as the appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered Carne asada burrito with no black beans inside and the meet didn't have any flavored and inside of the burrito is mostly rice. And the rice also didn't taste like anything. The service was good because we had three server. But overall the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"This was just ok for me and probably my least favorite meal during my week at the MGM. I'm sad about that because our group had set such high expectations for Hecho. That might be because they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, so we felt like we had really waited to give them a try and let the anticipation build a bit. The chips were not warm and did not taste freshly made. I ordered chicken tacos and the chicken was very dry and did not taste fresh. I feel like my order sat for a while and maybe I should've sent it back. I'm giving them 3 stars because while my hubby agreed with me on the chips, he enjoyed his fish tacos and margarita.  All in all, we are in no hurry to go back but would definitely give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place was insanely average and way overpriced. Not much more to say.   Im tempted to keep typing just because Yelp awards longer reviews but all you need to know is in that first sentence. Go somewhere else unless you absolutely need Mexican cuisine to live. I imagine there are some good hole in the wall Mexican places a short walk away."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'm a bit surprised that other people have reviewed the service as being poor. Maybe I happened to get a great waiter. If the owners/managers for Hecho reads this, I just want you to know that Dana was a fantastic waiter. If you order the guacamole, they make it right at your table and it was so damn good!  Now to be fair, I don't have a lot of experience with non-Taco Bell Mexican food so I don't know if the food is objectively amazing or not. But I loved it. The portions were generous."}
{"text":"This was a decent, mid- to high-end Mexican establishment. Service was pretty good. I had the tamales, which were fair. My girlfriend had the fish tacos. Those were pretty good. They carry the higher end Grand Marnioer there (Centennial I think). Good Stuff."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food, do not come here. Staff was friendly and the food arrived quick, but the food was bland and I knew at first bite that it wasn't any good"}
{"text":"All of us (4) really enjoyed our meals and drinks at this location. My husband and I used to go here 10 years ago when it was Diego's and it was amazing. Unfortunately, about 6 years ago Diego's wasn't good anymore, but then on this trip we noticed it had been completely redone with a new name and we decided to give it a try! :)  First of all, the service was excellent the entire time! Our waiter was very friendly, fun, and on top of it. The manager also came over and introduced himself and he was very nice also...we even got a free beer when a table said they didn't want what they had ordered so our waiter just brought it to us LOL  We started with DRINKS! My husband and I each got large Coronaritas and they were delicious. I got mine watermelon flavored...yum! Definitely tasted the booze in them! Our friends got the fish bowl sized Mojito and it was huge and they loved it! We definitely had a good buzz going on when we left!  I ordered the fundido because I love cheese, simple as that! It was delicious! Some of the best I've had!   My husband got the chimi changa that  had been all over the posters in the casino and he said it was definitely good enough to warrant the posters. I got the tri colored enchiladas. They were good, but not great. Our friends split the tamale sampler platter (and they loved it) and also go the mini chimi changa appetizer plate. They loved everything they got. They, in fact, loved in so much that they went back again the next night! LOL  I would definitely return to this place again. I was sad when Diego's went down the drain, but I'm happy to report that it has been revitalized into something good again as Hecho en Vegas!"}
{"text":"Good food, not amazing. Came here because I had a free margarita with purchase from MyVegas App. My husband and I shared a chimichanga. It was pretty good but a bit expensive even with the free margarita! We walk by this place a lot since we stay at MGM and I'm surprised it's still here because it's usually slow. It's kind of out of the main area, maybe that's why? Service was good, friendly people. Would come back if it was convenient but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite before a show. Pretty good food, drinks, and service. Decent prices, but the food and service rise above. I don't often go to a strip casino to eat. The prices reflect the idea of is on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"The food here was really just ok. I came here for lunch with a party of 5 and was slightly disappointed. I guess coming from LA I expect a little more from Mexican food. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was really bland. The one thing I will say is that the drinks here are pretty good."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is awesome! Unfortunately I did not have a good experience at this restaurant. Food is pricier than usual even for \"strip\" prices. Food took forever to come out and some of the food was colder. I didn't want to hassle the server and just sucked it up and ate anyways.... and I wasn't impressed by the quality of food at all.  At a high price point, I don't really see the value at this restaurant. The decor is pretty awesome though!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Hecho. The environment is excellent with bright colored walls and neat decor, staff was amazing and friendly, and the drinks were delicious and strong. Complimentary chips and salsa are great, the red salsa is my favorite. For a mean I ordered the huge taco salad that was served in a giant taco shell. It was full of flavor and I was able to substitute refried beans for black beans."}
{"text":"Daniel was very helpful in making menu suggestions. From the chips and salsa to the Cadillac Margarita to the Enchiladas to the strawberry tres leches, everything was delicious. Thank you Daniel."}
{"text":"Can you say da bomb diggity!!! Excellent food and service. The food is fresh and the service from the staff is top notch. Had the bandera chicken burrito...moist meat and a tortilla that melts in your mouth. Will be back soon for surezn"}
{"text":"Pleasant service and environment. However we specifically made the trip for happy hour involving all you can drink margaritas. The sign at the front said happy hour was on but when we were seated we were informed that the deals were not on this evening. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Hecho before seeing Kà.  I had a reservation for 5 PM when they opened and I was seated in a short time.  I was taken to the back left of the restaurant.  I really like the way the place has been changed.  The large room has been subdivided into several smaller areas that keep the noise to a minimum and also give you a feel of being in a smaller place than it is.  Complimentary chips and two salsas were brought.  The chips were nondescript and the salsas were OK.  The green tomatillo wasn't as flavorful as the red which also had some spiciness to it.  I started with pozole.  It was good tasting.  I was surprised that the corn had been not left whole but had been chopped.  I guess it's just their way but I hadn't seen pozole like this before.  There was a nice seasoning to the soup.  For the main course, I had pollo barracho, drunken chicken.  Along with the chicken were some mixed vegetables in a cream sauce and what I call and open face tamal.  The chicken was cooked and sliced and was served with a sauce that was more a tomatillo than a barracho.  There were no olives and there was no olive flavoring, something I expect with barracho.  The vegetables were good.  It was a mixture of carrot, corn, zucchini and tomato cubes  coated with a thick sauce.  I called it an open face tamal because the masa filling was placed on top of some fold corn husks and one didn't have to open the husks to get to the filling as you normally do.  Time for dessert and I got the raspberry tres leches.  The menu describes it as vanilla tres leche trifle with raspberry compote and a cinnamon sugar buñuelo (Mexican style).  The dessert was really good.  The trifle with the raspberry was great!  Service was good.  The pace was perfect.  There was ample time between courses.  I was never tapping my foot waiting for something to be brought, either.  My server checked on my several times while I was there and my iced tea was refilled without asking."}
{"text":"It was such a joy to find Celiac friendly restaurant right in our hotel. The service was top notch. All our food was melt in your mouth amazing. And the mojitos??? The watermelon was the best drink I had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is washed out Mexican food... I am nit staying its bad, just sort of bland... the best thing was the tableside guacamole. Ordered the pork burrito and it was just okay.  Not my style of Mexican Food..."}
{"text":"There were three of us looking for something to eat in Vegas. We were exploring the options in MGM and came up this place.  The service was great.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers and wait staff were friendly and engaging.    The food was great. I had what was probably the best Chimichanga that I have ever had.  It was a carne asada (I think)  chimi.  The outside was crispy and the inside, piping hot.  My dining companions had Nachos and burritos.  Everyone loved their meals and commented that the meats were seasoned perfectly.  The only drawback is that I am accustomed to getting complimentary chips and salsa. We had to pay for them here.  I think they were around $6.50. Since the chips were so good, I really didn't mind. They were worth it."}
{"text":"Decided that since it is Cinco de Mayo I need to get my celebration on with tacos and margaritas so I have heard good things about this Mexican food restaurant so here I am. One has to start with Margaritas, I am on my second one but they are so very smooth. I love how bright and open that this establishment is. I sat at the bar so this time and the service was excellent just as if I were at a table. The bartender is attentive to all the customers and is so busy. Since I have sat down he has not stopped moving.   I ordered the carne asada tacos and these tacos come with bacon and the steak how awesome is that. I had them hold the avocado and put the salsa on the side. After putting in my order with the bartender my food just arrived poof just like that. I had my food before my margarita how cool is that. All in all it is a fabulous place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful & colorful restaurant!!!  I get that it's Vegas and EVERYTHING is expensive, I felt like the quality of the food did not match the price.   For example we ordered chicken tacos which the meal comes with 2 tiny tacos & rice with veggies mixed in for $22 I believe. Usually authentic tacos are small but they pack flavor. These were kinda bland. My mom ordered a $26 taco salad. It had large chucks of meat that needed to be cut down into smaller pieces. Of course all they provided is a butter knife (which is difficult to cut meat let alone tender pork with). The waiter hardly came back, by time he did my mom didn't even want the dish anymore.   I will give credit where credit is due! The table side fresh guacamole was great!!! The only thing worth it. They actually come over to your table and make the guacamole how you want it. You can choose your spice level. I probably won't go back but if I did this would be the only thing I order.   The service wasn't that great for being an upscale type restaurant.   In a nutshell, the food isn't worth the price. You can find GREAT flavorful authentic tacos & good fresh guacamole for a way better price."}
{"text":"Took amazing care of us. Sweetest service, great waitstaff. Very impressive. Food is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with Hecho here in Vegas. As a person living with celiac disease, I was having a very difficult time finding somewhere in MGM to grab a quick lunch. No one in the food court area offered allergen info, so I felt I was at a loss. Being pregnant doesn't help, I'm hungry! :) I was told by a friend that Hecho offers gluten free items, but to my dismay, they don't offer to-go orders. I wasn't looking to sit and have a long lunch on my own. Just needed to pick up something quick. After speaking briefly with the manager, he was quick to accommodate me and escorted me to the bar area, informed the bar tender to have my order packed to-go, and made me a happy gal! He even made sure my gluten free taquitos were cooked in their designated fryer. Thanks, Hecho! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Mexican style cuisine.  I enjoyed the seasoned skirt-steak fajitas, served with roasted red bell peppers and onions with sides of pinto beans and rice.  The steak was very nicely seasoned; very flavorful.  There was a lovely sauce over the whole dish that really brought it all together.  The beans were rather plain and the rice was dry and boring.  It didn't matter really since I was quite content eating the fajitas and did not leave hungry.  Service was very attentive and the fresh salsas were a really nice touch.  I would recommend to anyone staying at the MGM Grand."}
{"text":"I scheduled a reservation on Opentable for Hecho en Vegas MGM Grand for dinner during the Legalshield convention. Based upon Yelp reviews, I had high expections. Needless to say that got shot down quick. While one waiter was very friendly another waitress was sent to take our order after the first waiter said he'd return for our order. We were provided water while we reviewed the menu. Our order was taken and the waitress never asked us which drinks we'd like to order. The food was bland and seemed to have an ingredient or spice missing from the preparation. The guacamole was bland considering that it's freshly made. After we finished dinner, we were asked if we'd like dessert but we declined.   While it's a great idea to offer water to the customers while reviewing the menu for their meal, do NOT forget to take a drink order from the customer.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant when I was visiting friends in Tucson, Arizona where I dined at El Charro restaurant.  Tucson is the Mexican Food capitol of the United States and one of the best restaurants (and there are many) is El Charro! El Charro has been in business since 1922 and for good reason.  I was so excited to see an article posted on the wall saying they just opened up in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand but under the name of Hechos En Las Vegas! I told my kids, my brothers, my sister and we had a group of 14 people very excited to finally have good Mexican food in Las Vegas.  The servers were very nice and we were excited to tell them that we were originally from Tucson and looking forward to the food.  The first sign that things were not going to taste like El Charro was the chips and salsa.  This was definitely not El Charro's salsa.  It was thick and had a hint of \"tex-mex\" in the flavor.  Then we got our menu's.  This was definitely not the menu I was expecting.  I had even called the original El Charro in Tucson and asked if it was their recipes and menu... and they told me yes.  Well, it appears to me that the Las Vegas crew thought they knew better than a 92 year old restaurant and they changed everything.  Which is ironic since our waiter told us that he previously worked at another Mexican restaurant in MGM and they closed it down.  Duh!  It probably sucked and yet they had the same crew make a bunch of changes to this Mexican food concept.  Everyone in our party said that their food was very dry.  They hardly put any enchilada sauce on the food. And my enchilada plate had some kind of pickled cole slaw/cabbage thing on it (what?) along with very dry Spanish rice and black beans.  Black beans?  This plate should have had the amazing re-fried beans that you finish eating with chips at the end of your meal because you just can't leave a drop on your plate.  To add insult to injury, our bill was $465! We had very below average Mexican food at 4 start pricing.  The only thing that was good was the guacamole that they made table side. Everything else was a disgrace to the El Charro name - at least they didn't use the real name of the restaurant they were supposedly modeling after!  Unless someone from the real restaurant comes in and changes everything soon, I predict that this restaurant won't last very long."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the dinner here. It is pretty much how I expected and hoped it would be. I saw a couple of bad reviews on here, but I think these people are kind of out there.  First off, walking up to the place you can tell that its a comfortable, casual, and energetic type of place, and to me that is perfect if you are trying to hang out and relax.  We got our water, and placed our order for margaritas and table side guac from our perfectly friendly server, and both were good. I had \"The one and only combination\", and my wife had the skirt steak fajitas, Very tasty for sure.  I cant say anything bad about this place.  People complaining about the price (which actually isn't high) should probably review the menu before hand, and then go to the food court next store.  On the strip, out drinking, don't feel like being bound to a dinner schedule? This is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD!!!! It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. Chips & salsa, fresh chips  they are exactly what you dream about when wanting chips &quac!!! The chicken tortilla soup was the best I've ever had. The table side guacamole was delicious, it a a must order!!!! I love that they ask how hot you want it. We had the kids with us so we made it mild, then had to fight my 3yr old for it she ate it with a spoon. ( super kid friendly place, everyone in there was having a good time & much louder than my kids)  Fish tacos were very good & SPICY! The shrimp cocktail was good, had a little sweet flavor to it which was different than what we were expecting but it was yummy. Even my sons plain chicken & cheese quesadilla was to die for.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fajitas, the meat was very tender and cooked nicely but they seemed a little bland after the rich and perfectly seasoned appetizers. Luckily I was so full from the appetizers it wasn't a big deal.    The service was awesome!!! We didn't have a reservation and it was a busy Saturday night but we only waited about 5mins. The server was friendly, fast and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was so good and the chips and salsa were yummy and generous servings/refils.  The server was friendly and attentive.  The bus boys were working hard and friendly/helpful as well.  Would love to come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday at 9:pm and although there were several tables open I was told I had to wait. Waited for 15 min while watching other people coming in and getting seated even though they didn't have a reservation. They serve Mexican food but just not for Mexicans.  Shame!"}
{"text":"Skip the dining room and eat at the bar. Robert was our bartender and he did a great job. He's very knowledgeable about the tequila. We did a full on tequila tasting and got a little lesson in each brand. His service was top notch. The food was good, but I think the tequila was my favorite part."}
{"text":"Came here on our last night and vegas and had a great meal between 4 of us. By this point we had eaten quite alot through out the day so we each split a dish. Fajitas for 2 and Enchiladas for the other 2. That with the tableside guacamole was more than enough for us. The flavors in all the dishes were great, the atmosphere was great and our waiter was always attentive. Overall a great place and I would go back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but they where very busy and the service was poor the bus boy Lamin was very attentive  helped more then the server . We asked for the manager and he never came. Would come back when it's not so busy but it is Vegas ."}
{"text":"Dana is mentioned in a couple of reviews and now I know why! She's amazing; such great, warm, friendly service!  We went last night to Hecho & were blown away by the food. Why does this place not have better reviews? First off, their There's a Name For That margarita/Modelo beer mix was soooo good. Served in a a chilled glass, just the right mix and when you're done, you still have leftover beer :-) The jalapeño margarita was a bit too sweet but so good. It was spicy and smoky and disappeared way too quickly.  The Ahi Ceviche was so fresh and the tortilla chip it sits on was perfectly crunchy and portion size was great: 3 large chips overflowing with cubed ahi & delicious avocado. The mole chicken enchilada and refried beans were tasty & well-seasoned. I do wish it'd had a little more mole sauce on the plate.  We also got the carne asada tacos & although I wasn't thrilled about the bacon on there, it tasted so good I didn't mind it. I seriously need to find out how they do their tomatoes in this dish because they were crazy delicious.  Delicious Mexican food in a very unexpected place. Between the food & the Alejandro Fernandez concert, it was a great night!"}
{"text":"Table side guacamole 4/5 stars  It was made fresh table side and the waitress added tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. She asked before putting in the jalapenos how spicy we wanted it which was nice.   Mini chimichangas, assorted tray 4/5 stars Chicken 4/5 stars  Pork 4/5 stars  Cheese 3/5 stars     Beef and chicken nachos 4/5 stars  I personally liked the beef nachos better than the chicken. More flavor but both yummy!   Meat Platter with rice & beans and tortillas (carne asada steak, carnitas, grilled chicken, and grilled shrimp) 4/5 stars   Tres Leches Cake 3/5 stars (only because I personally don't care for coconut and it was dusted with coconut on the outside of the cake.   Chocolate Flan 3/5 stars I liked the flan top part but the chocolate bottom was not that tasty.   Churros w/ chocolate and caramel sauces 4/5 stars  They were hot and fresh and the sauces were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in on our first night in Vegas. We started with some chips and salsa. They don't provide them free like they do back home, but that's okay. They had two salsas, a roasted tomato, and a tomatillo which both were very good. I ordered the fish tacos and he ordered the enchiladas. Mine was very good. The fish was lightly fried and the dressing light which was what I was hoping for. My friends plate was huge and he seemed to enjoy it as well. The food was good, not great, but good. The four stars really was for the margarita. One of the best I've ever had. To sum it up, it's really a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Hecho en Vegas offers great happy hour specials (for being on the Las Vegas strip) and tasty Mexican dishes.   The restaurant itself is appealing aesthetically, with bright colors throughout the entire restaurant. The seating area also opens out into hotel and casino, which is very inviting to those who walk by.   Their happy hour is fabulous! I believe it's Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 5p-7p at the bar. Everything is $5! Guacamole, draft beers, Carne Asada fries, margaritas, and more. They also offer complimentary chips with red and green salsa. I personally love their red salsa, it's FULL of garlic flavor!! I could easily eat a whole bowl myself.   The staff here is great, the bartenders and bar backs are so friendly and make the bar atmosphere fun. We've had Cesar serve us at the bar several times and he is phenomenal. The restaurant managers Curtis and Fred are wonderful too, they walk around the restaurant floor, engaging with the guests. They always check up on us whenever we go!   I've been here quite a few times, mostly for happy hour and a few times for dinner. Their taco salad is enormous! The salad is tossed in a creamy dressing and served to you in the largest hard taco shell. Very filling and tasty. I've also tried their chicken fajitas which were magnificent and probably my favorite dish.  I would recommend this place for a fun happy hour on the strip. Great specials and great service!"}
{"text":"We ordered nachos, guacamole (they make it fresh at your table!), fish tacos and churros for dessert. All the items were delicious and fresh with lots of flavor. We are staying at MGM, so it was extremely convenient! Great menu and bar selections. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Mexican food and missing my good ole' Tex Mex I get back home, so I made hubby go here to have some grub and margaritas.    We ordered the queso for starters.  It comes with flour tortillas but we requested they not bring them because that would be too filling.  The chips were ok and the green salsa that they bring out was so good!  I didn't care for the red salsa too much, as it had a roasted taste to it.  I ordered the street tacos for my meal.  I thought the pork was hands down the best one, and I do not eat pork.  So I probably wouldn't get this again.  Another night we were there, we had drinks at the bar.  It seems to me they have a different bar food menu, as there were fish tacos on the bar menu and I was annoyed because I would rather have had that than the stupid street tacos I had the day before.  The margaritas were good, but I can honestly say the food is just ok.  We both paid for it the next day, so I wouldn't eat here again.  LOL!  The food is 2 stars, the drinks are 4 stars, and that makes them a 3 star place!"}
{"text":"This place was great.   Unique menu items but, has all the staples.  The service was excellent and the ambiance was pretty lively."}
{"text":"The table side guacamole is a must! I'm giving this place 4 stars simply for the service. The food was sub par. My carne asada tacos tasted like the meat had been broiled not grilled like in most Mexican restaurants. Our server was amazing, I wish I could remember his name, and made our dinning experience very fun. He was joking with us the whole time and constantly checking in on us to see if we were doing well or needed anything. They have all sorts of premium tequila and the top shelf stuff, which is meant to be sipped, is served in a champagne flute! Again, guac was good but the rest of the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant since the reviews avg a 3, but I give it a 4.  You have to get the guacamole made fresh at your table side. We asked for it spicy, and it still could have been hotter, but oh my, it was delicious!  The chips were ok, but I did not like either of the salsas they put on the table.  This is why I can't give them a 5.  I ordered the 3 chimichanga appetizer and it was good...especially the beef one. However it came with little diced onions all over it, so be warned if you don't like raw onions. The menu didn't say onions, so I did have the opportunity to say hold them. Now you do!  ;)"}
{"text":"The service was great so I will start with that. We had a large group of 18 and that can be a lot of keep up with. Food was disappointing - mass produced and lacked flavor. I ordered chicken tacos and the chicken was incredibly dry I didn't eat much. They did have some nice cocktails, but you can find other better options in the city."}
{"text":"Medium quality food, high cost expected for being at the MGM, and good service. Like most places in Las Vegas it is on the \"ok\" side. Most eateries are either just ok or not good and this one is more on the side of the former. But, still just ok and nothing worth making plans to go out of the way."}
{"text":"food was ok (i don't ask for much when it comes to tex-mex) but service was soo horribly slow that day."}
{"text":"Ok this place is great. The tequila selection is awesome and he bartenders know their stuff. Their flagship tequila is a special Clase Azul Joven made especially for MGM. At $60 / glass, it's steep but worth it if you are a tequila fan. We've had the chips and guacamole but we haven't had a meal here yet. We'll be back soon though so we are looking forward to trying it out. The biggest downside is that they aren't open on Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the MGM Grand, this is a great place for a quick bite to eat.  My boyfriend and I grabbed our last meal in Vegas here before heading to the airport and really enjoyed it.  We had just left the pool and picked a table where we could people watch.  The tableside guacmole was delicious and we scarfed it down in about three minutes.  We both ordered rather large meals and were able to have them packed up so we could eat them at the airport.  Both our burrito and enchiladas were good and if I stay at MGM again, I will definitely stop by for a meal and drink."}
{"text":"came here with a group after frozen fury, it is right outside the mgm garden arena.  I would say walk your drunken self else where if i were you.  For the price of everything, the portion size was really small and the flavor was lackluster. The whole table felt the same way. 2 people from out table even returned their margaritas because they didnt taste right. The server was nice, but that doesnt really make up for everythign else."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch surprise this morning. The restaurant was opened for brunch for the first  time and it was awesome, with live mariachi, good mimosas for $3 amazing coffee and amazing chilaquiles verdes with chicken and eggs. Saul our waiter was really nice and helpful! Editing my review, to top it off Kevin the manager came to our table and offered us a round of free drinks!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation via OpenTable for my family to celebrate Father's Day and we were seated promptly. The restaurant is really nice with modern decor. Definitely suitable for special occasions and semi-casual affairs.  I had informed my family about their Happy Hour and we briefly perused the menu at the hostess stand. We requested these menus once seated, however, we were informed that the \"menu was basically all the appetizers, half off, except the Chicharrón.\" That was satisfactory. Well, until I realized that I had researched these details the week prior and the other part of Happy Hour was $5 margaritas. No one told us this information, so it is possibly only offered at the bar?  Complimentary tortilla chips and salsas start your meal. The chips are seasoned nicely and the salsas (Rojo and Verde) are delicious (my favorite being the red, of course). We opted for the Tableside Guacamole ($10) made with avocado, freshly-squeezed lime, cilantro, serrano chili, onion, tomato, and sea salt. The guacamole-dedicated cart (adorable) rolls over to your table and asks how spicy (mild, medium, or spicy) you want your guacamole prior to its creation. This guacamole received my high stamp of approval! It was my mom's first time trying guacamole - I don't know what compelled her (although I like to think that my love for avocado was the influence) - and she loved it! We also started with the Short Rib Taquitos ($12): slow-cooked shredded beef, served with salsa verde, crema, and queso cotija. Crunchy tortillas and succulent meat. I'm not sure I would be able to identify the short rib without being told, but it was certainly more moist and soft than most beefs I've had in Hispanic cuisines. The taquitos lacked proper seasoning, but tasted really great with the table Salsa Rojo.  My mom ordered the MGM Grande Taco Salad ($14): Crispy flour tortilla, chopped romaine, refried beans, pico de gallo, black olives, tres quesos blend, avocado, chipotle ranch, and shredded beef (alternatives: chicken or carnitas). The shredded beef seemed like the Short Rib in the taquitos, although indicated differently on the menu. Either way, the salad was delicious! The flavors were wonderful together, the meat was so tender, and everything was so fresh. However, there was WAY too much cheese and as with all taco salads, too much fried tortilla (which I discarded without remorse). This was the best entree at the table.  Other entrees at the table included Tres Carnes Enchiladas ($20), Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($17), Mesquite Chicken Taco Platter ($17), Mesquite Chicken Burrito ($18), and Carne Asada and Applewood-Smoked Bacon Taco Platter ($18). I didn't try any of the enchiladas, but my brother noted that the meats were a little dry (except the shredded beef). The Hecho mole negro was flavorful, but a tad sweet for me. I'm usually a fan of mole, but this one didn't do it for me. I also had a bite of the Mesquite Chicken taco and I did not care for it. The breast was surprisingly moist, but lacked flavor. The Carne Asada tacos was my entree and I was displeased. The beef was dry, I couldn't taste the bacon, and it was weirdly sweet. It also had an abundance of non-spicy marinated red peppers (most likely bell) that proved an odd addition. I didn't eat the second one. The refried beans and rice served with most dishes were unimaginative and lacked great flavor. I didn't eat these items either.  My dad wanted a margarita, so I ordered him the Muy Picante ($14) made with Chipotle-infused Patrón Reposado Tequila, Patrón Citrónge, fresh lime juice, and agave nectar. It had a really great smokiness from the chipotle infusion and a nice balance of sweetness.  We shared Fried Ice Cream, Cinnamon Churros, and Raspberry Tres Leches ($7/each) for dessert. The corn-crusted dulce de leche ice cream had a Oaxacan chocolate ganache center and it was very tasty. The Tres Leches (Vanilla tres leches trifle with tart raspberry compote) didn't actually taste like \"Tres Leches\" usually does, but it was a decent dessert. The churros were pleasantly soft with the perfect crust. It also featured a cream center (could do without it) and served with Oaxacan chocolate ganache and Cajeta. Loved the Cajeta because it's not nearly as thick as caramel and not as sweet.  Service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and extremely accommodating. I'm a little torn about the food since it wasn't really what I expected. It's supposed to be Sonoran style or inspired (New Mexico/Mexico border) and perhaps I'm not familiar with its flavors or maybe it's too Americanized. Overlooking authenticity, I wasn't pleased with the majority of main dishes based on preparation of meats and overall seasoning. However, I really enjoyed the salsas, guacamole, and short rib (or shredded beef). These strong areas are not quite enough to carry a restaurant, so I can't say I'm a fan. Also, prices seem a little high ($32/person), but the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Overly priced food.. chips and salsa is not free..fish tacos were good but probably will not return"}
{"text":"Delicious and fast I was impressed.  We came in hungry and left happy. The only thing I could complain about was a waiter that was in a hurry to clear our table ."}
{"text":"I came for my birthday and had dinner here. The bar staff was wonderful and the chicken quesadilla was sooooooo good!!!! Service was a little slow however"}
{"text":"Very expensive for just ordinary tasting Mexican cuisines.  Fish tacos were rubbery and the chicken tamales were just ok. Guacamole was not great either. Expected much more"}
{"text":"Do not go here! They brought the wrong order out not once but twice... The service was horrible. We had to physically leave our table and walk to the bar to order a drink because our server was MIA. The food is overpriced and un-flavorful. They were nice enough to comp some of our party's items but I would still never go back."}
{"text":"Our group had mixed feelings about Hecho during our recent trip.   We went on a Friday evening on arrival day, so it was at the end of a long day.  The food is good-I had the shrimp/steak fajitas which are very good-corn tortillas and good rice and beans rounded out a good dinner for me.   Others said the food was decent-my wife's tamale plate looked good and one friend had the all you can eat street tacos.  Drinks...I enjoyed my beer, but they are very high priced, as evidenced by the $80 pitcher of margaritas 3 at the table had.  They weren't aware this would be the price and felt it was not worth anywhere near that cost.  Service was decent and I'd try it again next time in town."}
{"text":"Great location and great guac made tableside. We had dinner on a Friday night and just watched all the drunk college kids leaving the pool. It was great entertainment watching them stumble by heading into the MGM itself.  Scary but good fun!  The tableside guac was excellent. The service was excellent. Food (other than guac)  was good but not excellent. We have been here before and will return. Great location, fair prices, great service, great margaritas and good food!  All in all good package and solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"We went here on our last night in Vegas. I'm always worried that the food inside the hotel is going to be sub par, but they did not disappoint here. We were greeted by the host and seated promptly. It was Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy, but it was also only 5:45pm. We had a show at 7pm so we wanted to get food in before the show. My husband had the three enchiladas with different types of meats and sauces. I had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce, with refried beans and rice, upon recommendation of our server. It had a nice little kick to it, but not overly spicy. It was delicious! The server also gave me a mocktail (I'm pregnant) which was fresh and fruity. It tasted like a smoothie than a mocktail but I was happy regardless. Food and drinks came out quickly and they also had an excellent drink list. My husband had the herradura tequila, one of his favorites. Altogether, great service and great food. Perfect for dates or just a nice meal with the family."}
{"text":"I had my hopes up for this place.  It's located at the MGM but is not open all week long.  I anticipated Wednesday  rolling around for its opening and we finally made our way over for dinner.  The quality of the food and the innovation in the dishes is not up to par with the rest of the restaurants in this restaurant row at MGM... and that's OK but just be aware that it's not your innovate Mexican fare.  It's straight up traditional Mexican.  The food has a nice presentation but there was nothing that really stood out taste wise.  The service was very good though."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a private group event, so we had apps + margs & sangria.  Honestly, I've had much better Mexican food. This is basically a step up from El Segundo or some other Mexican chain. I tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, chips & guac & salsa, quesadillas, & soft tacos. Also, this used to be the old Diego but it looks like they took down a few walls on the outside to make the space appear more inviting and make it look larger. Diego seemed pretty closed off.  The reason for the 4-stars is because the service and servers were nothing short of awesome. Very personable, always coming around with food and drink refills. Making great rapport with everyone and cracking jokes, making sure our glasses (literally) were never half empty. Service is a huge factor to me when dining out, and this place just killed it. Felicidades!"}
{"text":"Omg has to be the worst mexican place ive ever eaten at and way over priced. Order came wrong to start with then the right order was cold. Best thing Hechos can do is close down!!! You stand a better chance at tacos n rita."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and tasty. Good Mexican spot. Was little cold because of the cold air coming from outside. Started with the TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE ripe avocados, Serrano chilies, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and fresh-squeezed lime juice, seasoned with sea salt  Had some fresh shrimp tacos and ended with a fried ice-cream."}
{"text":"Waited 30 min for chips and salsa and then another 30 for our entree. Taste was fine but honestly the slowest service ever. Portions are tiny. Big disappointment"}
{"text":"Stayed at the signature at mgm and wanted something somewhat close so decided to try hecho en vegas after being really disappointed by the mgm buffet the night before. We are from Texas so mexican food is pretty common for us at home and thought this would hit the spot.  First off, this place is REALLY loud. It's like a club more than a resteraunt. The front desk girl found us a table in the far corner where it was somewhat quiet though so that really helped. Very nice staff!  Right off the bat we knew we might not be completely happy. My wife asked if the shredded beef was barbacoa and the waiter who was Hispanic didn't act like he knew what barbacoa was. Then when we asked for a pina coloda we were told they didn't make those. My wife instead ordered a beerita and the waiter looked at her like she was crazy not realizing they are called that. They called it the \"there is a name for that\". When she got it the glass was so small that she couldnt flip the beer into it and still get a straw in so she drank the beer and maragarita seperatley. Not looking good so far!  We got chips and salsa and the green sauce was pretty good, red sauce tasted odd. Not bad, just odd. We also got table side guacamole and this is 90% of the reason for giving it as many stars as I did. It was awsome!   My wife ordered the short rib tacos and I got the steak fajitas. I got flour tortillas with mine and hers came with corn tortillas. Both tortillas tasted bad and killed the taste of the meats. The fajitas were a bit bland but my wife said hers short rib tacos were pretty good after she ditched the tortillas. Beans and rice were average at best.   To sum it up, if your looking for a place for beers and some pretty awsome dipping guacamole and dont mind ear numbing loud music then this place is pretty good. If you want a full dinner in a dinner environment and expect good mexican, go elsewhere. I'm pretty convinced that someone could make a killing in vegas with a authentic mexican resteraunt."}
{"text":"We took a group here while at a conference at the MGM and it was great -- much better than I expected.  Terrific, friendly service.  Tableside guac!!!!  Try the spicy version.    Pitchers of margaritas were fun and loved the fajitas.  Great for groups."}
{"text":"The most expensive, unimpressive and bland chicken tacos I've ever had. Staff was nice but the food was not with the price"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience for the tastebuds! I have yet to have a bad meal or service. Food and service are definitely top notch. Pricey of course, but isn't everything in Vegas? Definitely worth it! Tamales and mojitos are amazing! And don't forget the fresh made guacamole!"}
{"text":"I recently found out I have a gluten intolerance so I was worried about finding legit gluten free food in Vegas since it's always risky eating out. I was scared of being hungry the whole trip because of restaurants only having options like chips and salsa or salad. I found this restaurant during my gluten free search and decided to check it out. The menu has very clearly labeled GF options and lots of them! Both appetizers and entrees. I got enchiladas with beans and rice and nachos and it was delicious! The portion size was good as well. I ate here both days I stayed in Vegas because it had the most options for GF and the menu was so conveniently labeled. Staff was very friendly as well. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone but specially for those trying to eat gluten free!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here. So I can't comment on the food. We finally left after waiting 45 minutes for a seat. There were plenty of tables open that needed to be cleaned off. Monique, the hostess, kept telling us they were getting it set up. 45 minutes and 4 conversations later, we finally left. There were 3 girls at the hostess stand, just standing around. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever, enchiladas are out of this world!!! The food was fast and fresh, guacamole and salsa chip dishes were excellent as well. The bartender was great, courteous, and very helpful with knowledge of local locations! The ambiance of this restaurant was awesome, definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for Mexican food. Though it's inside the MGM it is an actual sit down spot with an extensive menu and is extremely well priced. I had the taco salad with chicken which I cannot recommend enough! Delicious cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Prices attached on the photo. Not too bad for a restaurant in the hotel. The table-side guacamole was the best thing we had. Although, fair warning- it's only one avocado. It was fine for the 2 of us, but you'd need to order more for a larger party. I got the fish tacos, and I'd rate them 4/5. My husband got the steak burrito, which they actually made with chicken on accident. He said it was bland. Their food could definitely use more salt overall. As for their service, we went on a Sunday night and the service was great. They actually comped the burrito after we told them it was made incorrectly (only to make sure we were charged for the lesser priced burrito), so kudos to them. Also, chips and salsa is $6.95. I would definitely upgrade to the guacamole because you get free salsa with that, and the salsa isn't that great. The chips were amazing though! I give it 4/5 for prices (comparable for the other causal dining hotel restaurants), 5/5 for the service, and 3/5 for the food."}
{"text":"Good for getting fed and gone. Average food and ~good~ drinks.   Made it here by 6:30 only to find they didn't have Happy Hour deals this week (ever?). Ordered fish tacos with a bonus carnitas taco. Nothing spectacular, but the carnitas was the second best I've had this week in that it didn't appear to be reheated for the fifth time (Yard House was tops believe it or not, Cabo Wabo was worst). Kitchen was lightening fast, cool for a busy week when a huge trade show was in town.     My advice? Grab a drink and a small app before you hit the road... then hit the road."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I was skeptical but I was not disappointed. The table side guacamole was excellent and the Herradura margarita was sublime. I love being able to take it \"to go\" because the casino floor just can't compete with a real margarita.   My husband and I split the steak/shrimp fajitas. It was all flavorful and between the fajita and guac we were full. The fajitas only came with 3 shrimp but we survived. Of course it's a bit overpriced because it's inside a Vegas casino but I was happy with it overall."}
{"text":"The shredded beef nachos were incredible. We ordered the fish tacos & they were way too salty. I told the waiter in a respectful way that I wouldn't recommend that dish. He saw that we didn't eat them & came back with the tacos off of our bill, no questions asked. Great service, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing tostada salad! I ordered it with chicken, and it was too much food. I could have done without the meat. I ordered the sangria, which was good, but it didn't come with any fruit. My husband had the enchiladas with white sauce that was amazing. Great food, but the service we got was amazing!!!!! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and very slow, it wasn't even busy when we came. Food was mediocre at best and over priced."}
{"text":"Pretty good margs and chips, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I am very partial to Mexican food so i was excited to try Hecho en Vegas. It's a huge restaurant, as they all are in Vegas, but we were seated at a corner table which made it a little more intimate. We were here celebrating a friend's birthday and the server made sure to acknowledge it with a birthday flan at the end of our meal so that was a nice touch. To start, get the guacamole; it's prepared table side and just to your liking-it was delicious! We all got a bunch of tacos and shared them, they were all good but I was especially partial to the chicken al pastor. The margaritas here are good but on the sweet side. I like mine a little more on the sour side, but to each his own. Not stellar or super creative food but the ingredients are fresh and the service was good, and the whole experience was refreshingly unpretentious."}
{"text":"Wandered into Hecho on a Saturday night and it was slammed. Unbeknownst to me at the time it was the night of a Madonna concert. Somehow I was able to get a seat at the bar. I ordered a beer and took a look over the menu. The menu had a lot of great looking choices and I wanted to try them all but my stomach is only so big. The salsas that came with the nachos were good and as I was munching on them I ordered the fish tacos. They were really good! They came with refried beans which I barely touched only because I wanted to make sure I had room for the tacos. I will say the prices are a little high but I was on vacation so it really didn't bother me that much. Nick the bartender was great! Very friendly, attentive and accurate!"}
{"text":"A-OK food (3 stars), but the service was horrendous beyond belief (-1 star).  Our waiter was the epitome of a douche. Throughout our entire meal, he was rushing us and didn't bother to listen to what we had to say. For example, I asked which seasoning sauce he recommended out of the three choices I had for the enchiladas and he basically just mocked me for asking and didn't answer my question. WTF? He got lucky that there was an automatic gratuity (which is probably why he thought he could act this way) since I had a party of 6. Otherwise, I would've left him a $0.99 tip.  Anyway, we got free chips and salsa (two kinds - red and green) which were yummy. Then we ordered two orders of guacamole (mild and medium), which they make in front of you! I think it was only $10, which is a steal compared to DC prices when they make the guacamole in front of you. The medium was basically mild... No hint of spiciness at all.  Me and a friend split the ceviche. We got the one that included both types of ceviche. I hated one of them - ahi something. It had wasabi in it, but after long days and nights of drinking, it tasted like Jose Cuervo to me. Blech. I liked the other kind though! The traditional Limey one with shrimp, cukes, etc.  Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their meal - they got steak fajitas, chicken fajitas, ahi ceviche, taco salad.  I got the beef enchiladas. They were just okay. The rice was the highlight of my dish, which in reality isn't even that good. I was just hungry :-)"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best experiences I've had with food in my life. My table ordered nachos, chips & salsa, fajitas, the tamale platter, and several other items and they were all amazing. The sangria was just ok though."}
{"text":"Get the table side guacamole! It is incredibly good...they make it fresh right in front of you. The best guacamole I have ever had! I ordered the grilled chicken fajitas and they were incredible. The chicken tasted like it was freshly cooked on a backyard grill. The portions were very reasonable and did not leave you feeling stuffed or uncomfortable. It is pricey but worth it in Vegas for the fresh food! If you are looking for really greasy Mexican food with super large portions that leave you feeling crappy & uncomfortable, this is not the place for you.  This place has fresh food! Perfect place to eat before hitting the town."}
{"text":"As soon I walked up the service was so friendly and the place was so colorful. We sat down and Dana was our waitress she had so much energy and was friendly helpful right off the bat. The drinks were tasty and the food was pretty amazing . I had the chicken fajitas . The hand made corn tortillas were so warm and dele icon the chicken was lean and soft. I think the highlight was desert , ordered the churros! Amazing cream filled churros served with warm rich chocolate and caramel! Amazing place it's a must visit every time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Hecho is so delicious! Went there two weeks ago during a birthday trip to vegas. And I ordered the chicken nachos. They were perfectly done. And perfect flavor. And the table side guacamole was amazing! They make it fresh right in front of you and I thought that was a nice touch. But beware they DO charge an extra fee for that. And they don't tell you anything about the fee until the bill comes. Sorta sneaky? lol But it isn't very expensive. So wasn't a huge deal unless your really pinching pennies. And its worth every penny once you taste how good it is. All the staff there were extremely kind and helpful as well. Only complaint, and this part has nothing to do with my meal. LOL Was afterwards went to the bathroom and saw a waitress that worked there, use the restroom & then she walked right out without washing her hands. Im just thankful she wasn't the chef! But that was gross to see. Other than that, Hecho is a great spot for good mexican food in vegas for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"So I must admit that my wife and I basically ate here by default on New Year's Day.  We were at MGM for the Justin Timberlake concert and were looking for a decent place to have dinner before the show.  Just about every other restaurant at MGM had about a 45 minute wait.  We didn't check the buffet or Rainforest Cafe, mainly because their buffet is terrible, and I'm not eating at Rainforest Cafe when I'm on vacation.  Anyway, we came upon Hecho en Vegas, which is located close to where you enter the arena.  My wife and I had just eaten Mexican at Javier's the day before, so we were a bit skeptical about eating it again.  But, it was either that or the food court, so we chose Hecho en Vegas.  They quoted us a wait time of about 20 minutes, but it was more like 10 minutes.  The restaurant is loud, fun, and vibrant.  I honestly had very low expectations going into dinner.  We were seated and were quickly given chips and salsa.  I thought they chips and salsa were good, but were certainly a cut below Javier's.  I preferred the green salsa to the red.  Our server was very friendly, and took the time to answer any questions we had about the menu.  For our meals, we each ordered two enchiladas, which came with rice and black beans.  I ordered one chicken with red sauce, and one cheese with a white cheese sauce.  I thought everything was really good, so I have to say that this place far exceeded my expectations.  My wife agreed that her food was good as well.  For as much as I really despise the MGM hotel, I can't say anything negative about Hecho en Vegas.  The food is good, the people are nice, and the environment is fun.  I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again if I was in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The food was pretty average but hit the spot when I needed it. The black beans were the best part of the meal,they had quite a kick. beef enchiladas were cool. Nothing really to write home about but if you want quick Mexican food this is the place. Oh and the drinks were weak. Won't rush back here."}
{"text":"A lot of the reviews don't really give this place enough love. 4 stars, not 5 because of price. It's a little pricey for what you get. But hey, that's the Vegas way anymore. The food was good. We opted for the table side guac and shared an enchilada. Portions are fair and filling. The staff is extremely friendly. And the manager, Kevin, stopped by our table and asked how the meal was. Also, location is good. Near the casino and the monorail if you aren't staying at the MGM. I'd come back if I win more at the slots!"}
{"text":"OUT of all the buffet's and places to eat Authentic Mexican food. This was the spot. My hubby and I came here on our last night in Vegas. I was super buffeted out, and I just wanted some authentic Mexican food. When we came to Hecho en Vegas, we were blown away with everything. The atmosphere feels like back home in San Diego CALI their chips, salsa, and guacamole are all hand made. What impressed me was the hand made guacamole. The waiter makes it fresh right in front of you. That was a plus in my book.   I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup and my husband order a trio plate. I forgot the name lmao! But, it came with a sweet corn tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and rice with beans.  The serving sizes are just right, not to much, or to little.  The Chicken Tortilla soup was amazing! And I am super picky about the soups I eat. I was satisfied. And my hubbys' plate was delicious!   I recommended everyone who enjoys authentic  Mexican food and to try it out. I think this place needs to make its way out to Southern California. They would make BANK!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable and the food was the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I went there with several friends before the Katy Perry concert which was taking place at the Garden Arena right across the way from the restaurant. It was all very convenient and easy. The price was not terrible and average for eating at a restaurant on the strip and for the quality of food you get it was very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos and quesadilla for just snack sakes.   Our server was so slow. The water host came by and for some ridiculous reason, brought us chips that we didn't ask for.. Why would we order chips? We ordered nachos.   Nachos were gnarly. Half movie cheese and half real cheese. It also had olives on it. What?!   Seriously. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  If you're looking for a giant a$$ margarita, this is your place.  Decent amount of seating within the bar area but this place gets packed. It's nearby the monorail entrance in MGM, has TVs in the bar for sports, and spotty service.   I tried to order a 'Coronita' margarita (the marg with small corona in it). Since they didn't have the small coronitas...the guy gave me a giant marg + regular corona and said he wasn't going to charge me for it. But he did. UGH. None the less it tasted just fine. Added mango puree and it was quite tasty for the most part. Sadly they were out of prickly pear.  And did I mention it was giant!?  My order of portabello mushroom fajitas was plentiful but also flavorless. Had to ask for salsa which made it a little better. Enough food for two people really but nothing outstanding. Prices were high for the quality you get, but hey, you're in Vegas?   The one thing that was awesome about coming to Hecho was the fact the GM took a spare moment to talk to each one of the patrons around the bar, seating areas, etc. Props for that!"}
{"text":"Oily and salty food, plus bad service. We waited long time to get our food. The table next to us came later than us, but got there food before us. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food with high quality ingredients. I definitely recommend the table side guacamole and the fajitas (the steak came out cooked perfectly!).  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The hostess, Jackie, was so rude! She ruined our experience. Our server Roberto was great, food delicious, but her attitude tainted the meal."}
{"text":"I came in for the all you can eat tacos for $20 had about two plates but they were really nothing special and aside from that somewhat reasonable price everything on the menu was very expensive. Im taking off 2 stars strictly for being overpriced and tasting bland and my 3 stars are strictly for the wonderful service, my server was named Jose and he did a great job and so did the ladies who took my reservation down."}
{"text":"Hecho is a cougar den with weird hours and spotty service. If you want some unusual people watching and an afternoon margarita, it's fine. If you want something else, there are much better options in the MGM complex."}
{"text":"Solid mexican food! Tableside guac was pretty good and the del coronado and 3cheese enchiladas were amazing. Benjamin was our server and was extremely friendly. 2 dinners, 2 drinks and tableside guac $73. A lil pricey but fun and worth it!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Decor is neat looking and the service is not bad.  They have red and green salsa and both have great flavor and a little kick. Table side guac is also available and they have a cart that does it so it comes quick. Chips are thicker and weren't my favorite but that's a small thing to the flavor of the dips.  Endless street tacos are interesting, but they are only 3 types and unsurprisingly small.   Had the chile relleno special with a walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. Fantastic, the quality of the ingredient were above average and it was well crafted and presented.   I would come back here for dinner."}
{"text":"They were great about serious gluten allergies (celiac) and the nachos were absolutely amazing and filling."}
{"text":"I would agree with a lot of the previous reviewers about the service as I will agree it's not great.  The restaurant is really large so even though they have a lot of staff they struggle to keep up with how big the place is.  On to what I consider much more important the food: We got the tableside guacamole which was really good.  The salsas weren't to my friends liking so they made a special really hot salsa that was what my friends wanted.  For entrees we got the steak fajitas which was above average, carnitas chimichanga which was huge and tasted like a barbeque pork chimichanga which my friend liked and the tamale trio which looked good.  Overall a pretty good place just be a little bit patient"}
{"text":"Nice little convienient spot, just dropped in and got a nice portabello, black bean fajita with asparagus onions and vegetables and of course salsa and guacamole. Gluten free corn tortilla.  Really nicely cooked and tasty.   Not much else except the manager checked on me which was nice touch, and the service and bus service was superb."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, this is THE World's worst Mexican Restaurant on the planet!! The price of My soup and a cheese dip could have fed a family of 4 in Mexico! The soup was cold, had to ask them to bring it back which they returned it 15 minutes later with wilted taco pieces in it, the cheese dip I ordered wasn't melted very much then they claimed they had no frozen drinks, what Mexican restaurant on the strip claims their frozen machine is broken? I thought they made their Margarita's by scratch not by a pre-making machine, then I asked for a mojito when I saw it on someone else's table to get it with no sweetener in it which I returned, not even a tiny bit of mint in it. The total cost for the soup and cheese dip and a glass of tap water was $34.00. Really was the worst food I ever ate. The Strip is bad news if they offer these kind of overpriced tourist traps. Oh and the server never showed up at my table for about 12 minutes. Will never go back again!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside MGM Grand casino and I went during CES.   Ordered and enchilada and a fajita.  The wait for the food took a long time. Pretty much finished all their nachos waiting for the food. When the food did arrive the food quality was average. Definitely I had better Mexican food than what they served. Without even tasting the fajitas visually the veggies were over cooked.   If you want Mexican food there are better places."}
{"text":"The bartender was hilarious and the people great. The food was AMAZING! I got the chimichanga experience and it was the perfect amount of food and each one was fantastic. I also got the guac, O. M. G......... So good. Highly recommend this restaurant. Super quick service too."}
{"text":"Really fun place with happy vibe. The free chips come with 2 salsas: a roasted red and green tomatillo. Both very tasty.  We shared the short rib taquitos which where delicious!   Huge selection of tequilas and the margaritas are made fresh with lime juice, no bottled mix.  Would definitely check this out next time you are in MGM."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Mexican in Vegas, this is your place!  The atmosphere is vibrant but classy...televisions are available if that's your desire, but there are also quieter areas of the restaurant if you want to get away.   The food is outstanding....I would describe it as a perfect blend of authentic Mexican with an American touch. Everything on the menu was unique in its own way. The desserts were just as good as the entrees.   The service matched the food...our server was attentive but not overwhelming.   In short -- great food, comfortable/clean/casual atmosphere, excellent service. Try a dessert...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Steak fajitas  fantastic. Read reviews and was on the fence because of service comments. Let me tell you that the service is a 5 star!! From the reservation person on the phone to the assistant Server Maria! Server Dana was exceptional and personable! Why a 4 star? Prices were a bit much. But its Vegas what can we say. Would come back! Thanks Dana and Maria!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I'd always meant to come here though I'm usually heading towards the monorail when I pass it by or I'm heading towards Pub 1842.  It was decent, but I think my judgement may have been impacted having eaten at Border Grill earlier in the day which is really good.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I am a lover of Mexican food. No doubt. Hecho in Vegas did not disappoint. More like hecho in Mexico. Hecho is in the MGM Grand. Lots of contemporary Mexican art to be admired while you enjoy your meal. Allow me to get to the food!  BURRITOS: Very large. Enough for two meals. Ingredients are notably fresh and flavors on point. Not over done or too spicey. Subtle undertones.   ENCHILADAS: Chicken, beef or cheese or  pork. I had cheese. The sauce is delicious with a blend of cheeses.   MOJITOS: I highly recommend  TEQUILA: Hecho has a long list if you're a TEQUILA lover. Speciality tequilas, old tequilas, tequila with a dead worm..lol  DIABLO ROJO: Tequila with pomegranate liquor and lime juice. The bomb. Its sooo good.  List of Mexican Wine. One of few places  with Mexican wines."}
{"text":"Who spends $32 for 4 pints of Corona on draft?  In Vegas?? I did.  I bought a round for the table. Never again. Ridiculously overpriced!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal we had of at least 10 meals on our trip.  Had rolled tacos, chicken enchilada mole, and tableside guac.  Sounds simple but they do it their own way, it was amazing.  And to top it off, the churros with dipping sauces were by far the best I have ever had.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Dana is the best server!!!! Friendly, upbeat and efficient. The place is great for a pre box match. The pomegranate margarita is great as are the street tacos."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. So worth it. The prices were right and the food was GREAT! We got the guacamole table which was fun and different. Highly recommend. Our table got nachos which were heaven, the cheese was perfect, the meat was juicy and the size was plenty. The chimichangas and burritos are huge enough to split. The enchiladas were good as well. Not sure if anything is bad at this place. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and checked our table frequently."}
