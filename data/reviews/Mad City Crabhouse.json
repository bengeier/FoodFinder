{"text":"I've tried eating here with my wife 3 times, with no luck. First and second time they were closed. Both different days between 6 and 8pm. So I called on a Friday night to make sure we'd be able to try this place out. The guy over the phone said yes we are open and I told him we'd be right there. We left and 10 minutes later we arrive. A guy is packing up the tables outside and quickly hurried towards the door. As we approached him and the door he said, Sorry we are closed! I told him I had just called and they said they'd be open. He paused for a second said, Nope Sorry! I can't help ya, slammed the door and locked it. I was shocked. I'm not even going to try for a forth time.  There are so many good resturant willing to serve me good seefood at a decent hour. I'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"I JUMPED on it when I found a CRABHOUSE actually opened up in Madison.  Such a shame, if you're going to open up a crabhouse in the middle of the Midwest and basically be the only of its kind in the area, please do it right.  I love seafood--especially king crab legs...but this was more like prince crab legs, as in smaller than my ex-boyfriend's penis (and that thing sure was small).  So disappointed.  Oysters gave me a stomachache for 2 days afterwards.  You are better off going to Sam's Club or Cub's and buying a pound of legs to boil it yourself.  Disappointing!  The only thing is the late night menu that I MIGHT come back to try. Calamari and crab cakes between hopping bars sound good.  One star for now, might add on another if the late night menu holds true."}
{"text":"Stick with what the resturant does best...the crab. Everything else was terrible. The crab by the pound is  good. It is $10-18 per lbs. With a whole dungness crab for $23. The dungness seemed to yield the most meat. The King crab legs where medium sized not the huge one you would normally think of.   The waiter boasted about how good the salmon was when asked to chose between the salmon and the snapper. The salmon was totally wrong. It came luke warm with 2 thin slices of unmelted brie on top of it and a scant dribble of a bland \"Chambord\" rasberry sauce. The flavors were totally wrong together.The veggie of the day was horrible over cooked slimy spinach. It was a huge disappointment.   The crab cakes were overdone, dry and tastless.  They were unwilling to sub another vegetable for the asparagas but told my friend to just push it to the side.   All sides are extra. We got sweet potatoe fries for $1.99 each. We got maybe a 1/2 cup of fries. It was very small for $2 extra. They wereOK but nothing great.   Seven of us all agreed we will never go back."}
