{"text":"Great Chinese food and pleasant service, that's what I have had every time I've eaten at China Bay restaurant. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. If you stop by to place an order, expect a little bit of a wait, because they are pretty busy. I take that as a good sign. The owners are great people and the food is great. Well worth it if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had a favorite Chinese place and reluctantly decided to try something different  one day and ordered from China Bay. We haven't been back to our original Chinese place since! We also have no interest in trying another Chinese place since eating from China Bay. We have had it delivered and we've never had a problem. We typically pick it up just to save money and time. They are friendly and have always gotten our order right. Their food is delicious! I love their General's Shrimp and my boyfriend is obsessed with their Bourbon Chicken. Their rice (we've had most of their flavors) is by far the best rice around!"}
{"text":"Best place to get Chinese in the area for sure! I get it delivered to my house and they always get here pretty fast even on the weekends. Food always tastes great and they have amazing crab rangoon!"}
{"text":"Didnt order for awhile because I really like wings and so does my family. We ordered tonight 8 shrimp egg rolls which were great as usual. 2 large soups. They tasted good but seafood soup had almost no seafood. Its usually better  ut was ok. Fried rice seemed leftover and very mushy. Maybe I ordered too near closing. But I do know the wings were bad again. They need to get a new vendor and someone who knows how to cut wings. I have such mixed feelings about china bay but would still recommend it because when they are good they are great. I hope things will get better. They are still my favorite chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their food! Tom the owner and Cory the manager are wonderful. In a world of customer service going down the toilet, their customer service is top notch, but Toms wife is not a nice person and knows nothing about customer service. Will need to look for a new Chinese restaurant to give our money to."}
{"text":"Really great Chinese takeout. Chicken on a stick was tender and not dry like other places. Egg rolls were fresh and crispy, not too greasy or salty. Food was really hot, and I didn't have to wait long. Service was exceptionally kind. You can tell the owners really care about their customers and the quality of food they put out. Would definitely dine again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. Everything was SALTY. Tried stuff you couldn't screw up - crab rangoon & pork fried rice. I could barely eat the pork fried rice. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"How do you say yum in Chinese?? This place is so good, best Chinese food I've had in a looooong time. I live closer by so I ordered delivery, the good was Piping hot and the portions and very generous! I had the general so shrimp. The shrimp pieces were big and juicy and the shrimp fried rice was on point!! This is my go to Chinese food place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place moved to Brooklyn 2 years ago and this is by far the best Chinese around don't waste your time anywhere else... staff is very friendly and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food carry out on the westside.  Consistently the same quality for the past 2 years.   Have ordered shrimp egg rolls, vegetable fried rice, and many other dishes all very good.  Pleasant environment for pick up and coupons on menu!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese-style food I have had in Cleveland. It is always good and fresh. The delivery is fast! Best Lo Mein ever, I get the vegetable Lo Mein and it is full of good vegetables. Everything that I have tasted on the menu is so good. I go here whenever I want Chinese-style food. Advice-don't dine there-the dining room is kind of drab and depressing. But get take-out or delivery! You won't regret this!
Try the steamed dumplings, too. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you've got a craving for some chinese takeout, you probably have several similar options nearby. This particular location differs from other run of the mill chinese takeout in friendlier service, a cleaner atmosphere, and speediness. The food hit the spot. Wonton soup had plenty of hearty dumplings, the steamed dumplings were huge, soft, and delicious. The general tso's was okay, and my sweet and sour chicken was okay, although I would have liked it better if the chicken pieces were crispier and the sauce was already lightly coating the entree. 

Make sure to ask for utensils and napkins and grab some sauce if you need them."}
{"text":"Great prices, great service. Owners are super nice. I've been very pleased with my lunches here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until I called today and suddenly they no longer deliver to my apartment because it's \"too far\". They've delivered here 5 times before with no problem, and their food is amazing, but the fact that I'm suddenly outside their delivery range (I'm barely 3 miles away from them), is appalling. Never again."}
{"text":"China Bay is definitely my favorite Chinese takeout restaurants ! The store is always clean and they have fast and enjoyable service. The staff is very hardworking and everyone working there has always been nice to me. The food is always fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this store if you're looking for a new Chinese takeout place !"}
{"text":"Only one visit so far, but I was very impressed.  
I have been on the search for a quality General Tso's chicken for some time now.  Most places like this that are \"casual\" Chinese food (the type where when you walk in, you see pictures of the dishes above the counter) are similar in nature - low prices, good portions, but quality is all over the place, especially when it comes to chicken dishes.  This place was on point when it came to flavor of the General Tso's sauce and quality of the chicken.  I did not feel like because of the price ($9.50 for the large order which can easily be split) that the chicken used was of a lesser quality.  In fact, this was one of the few places where they used uniform sized cuts vs some big, some small.  While that might not seem all that important, whenever a restaurant uses larger cuts, I've noticed they usually are using lesser quality in order to do so.  I am definitely going back for more & will post again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the neighborhood!!!
I've lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and eat here often. It's ran by a awesome lady who is always there and always friendly."}
{"text":"I chose this place based on yelp reviews. It leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered Bourbon chicken on the lunch special. There was plastic in my food(photo provided). The chicken drowning in sauce did not cover up the old chicken they delivered to me.  I called and they graciously and quickly delivered a new order but it wasn't fresh chicken. But, it had no plastic in it this time so that's an improvement. I'm not sure if I'll venture here again, so far the outlook isn't good. Oh and no fortune cookie with delivery. :/
*I'm kindly giving 3stars as they replaced my food expediently at no charge."}
{"text":"This is the best take out Chinese in the area.  Food is always made perfectly and it's not super greasy. Super fast delivery...like 20 min..plus the delivery driver in the evening is kinda cute."}
{"text":"I visited China Bay this evening for the first time. I'm new to Old Brooklyn area, so I was hesitant to try a local Chinese restaurant. I'm so glad I did! I ordered Moo Shu chicken and veggie fried rice. They were excellent. The fried rice is some of the best I ever had and the Moo Shu with the pancakes and hoisin sauce was just what I needed for a hump day dinner. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great take out spot with quick delivery and great prices! Our regular order is the egg drop and wonton soups, chicken curry, and shrimp mei fun. The wonton soups and shrimp mei fun are particularly on point. Love China Bay!"}
{"text":"You know, this place probably has the finest take out Chinese food in the area, but it's not worth ALWAYS BEING RUSHED OFF THE PHONE AND FEELING LIKE I HAVE TO SPEED READ MY ORDER AND METHOD OF PAYMENT!  
This usually results in a botched order, but last night was especially bad. Exactly half my order arrived and when I realized, I called back and told the owner.  She assured me it would arrive shortly. I thought that because she didn't tell me she needed my cc/ info again that this was gratis because of my continued inconvenience with their inconsistency. But no, the delivery driver expected 11.50. I have to call back and call in the cc/info again meanwhile, the first delivery is cold at this point.  This isn't the first time something like this has happened but it will certainly be THE LAST TIME I ORDER FROM CHINA BAY."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to Chinese take-out and delivery fix! The reviewers who said China Bay has excellent sesame chicken were not kidding - that stuff seriously melts in your mouth. For an inexpensive, somewhat run-of-the-mill takeout place, the food is always better than the competition. There's even a small eating area if you are craving Chinese (American) but aren't going home!

More later - for now, give it a try if you are looking for good Chinese food in the neighborhood!

4 stars, for me, means that it's a nice establishment with no glaring flaws but nothing particularly outstanding to push it into '5' territory."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Chinese food!  I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who said he would order here everyday if he could - I do too, oh do I too.  China Bay happens to be right next to my gym, so you can imagine my existential crises as I pass it everyday on my way to the gym. 
      Finding a really good, or even 'okay', Chinese joint really is hit or miss...with mostly misses.  However, China Bay is incredibly delicious and the best around, in my opinion.  So good that my fiancee and I order here at least every two weeks and it's become a staple in our home.
     I've not once in the manyyyy times I've ordered take-out, been disappointed.  My standards are their melt-in-your mouth sesame chicken, vegetable lo-mein, egg rolls, and shrimp egg fu-yung, which are all incredibly tasty.  And their fried rice is great as well and isn't too greasy, which a lot of places mess up.
    Again, many Chinese places are hit or miss but China Bay hits the 'yummy' and 'satisfied' mark every time, leaving you feeling like Happy Buddha every time."}
{"text":"This place is so consistent and amazing. It takes everything in my power to not order numerous times a week. And it's awesome if you get to know the staff, they treat you extremely well. Love China Bay"}
{"text":"The egg foo young is great Won Ton soup is good but I dont like their other entrees the chicken has too much breading in it . We ordered some shrimp before that wasnt cleaned . They do make up for it by being nice people clean restaurant."}
{"text":"UN EDIBLE. Wish I could give it no stars. Worst Chinease food I've ever had. If you want good Chinease try china jade."}
