{"text":"Just had the build your burger and was great would have it again and suggest it  Also cold ass beer !"}
{"text":"Closed ! Gone - didn't take the customers to heart"}
{"text":"I really like this place for a lunch option. They have several choices on their menu from burgers to pizza. The inside is newly expanded to include a bar area. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We come here for football and all day happy hour. Tuesdays are awesome too! Their fireball and pints are $2 all day. I always order their french dip sandwhich and have recently tried their \"big burger draft\" and it was fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not good Messed up my elementary two item order Food is nothing special Waitress was fair but had no training on how to say a simple Thank you Will never be back"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time before they supposedly updated their establishment..  More like downgraded, their food is horrible now! Weird wanna be american sports bar atmosphere, out of several items just that day supposedly. Bad service and bad food, won't be back here."}
{"text":"This was fun. Didn't eat anything. Just drank. Great place to make friends. Great beer."}
{"text":"Food sucks,  they need a better chef or quality of food they are buying,  $4.00 for a salad that was served in a bowl for cereal for a  five year old. Ordered what I thought was a staple appetizer because they named it after Larry Fitzgerald of the AZ Cardinals and it sucks just as bad as the team, it came out cold the first time and then I've never tasted burnt deep fried food but that is what the second time came out to be.  The quesdilla was overloaded with peppers and very bland.   Beer is the choice for here, avoid food at all costs."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying their food is decent. Thats all I have to say positive though. Our server didn't write any of our 5 orders down and then came back two more times to ask my husband what he ordered and sent another server to ask my brother in law what he had ordered with his wings. Then all of our food came out separate and not by a few minutes.. It had to have been 20-25 minutes between the time I got my food and the time the last person got theirs.   Will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Came for food and drinks and was not disappointed by either. The drink special was $5 long islands and I've tasted better but they certainly didn't skimp on the alcohol so it was a good value. My lady and I got an order of this straw fries thing that had tons of grilled onions, nacho cheese, chipotle sour cream, etc on it (I can't remember the name of the item... it reminded me of the animal style fries from In-n-out only on steroids). They were delicious. A perfect drinking/drunk food (as I mentioned, those long islands were strong!). We also each got a hotdog, a new york style and a chicago style. We weren't blown away by them, but for the price they were definitely pretty tasty. The atmosphere of the place was good and the restrooms were clean (with funny sayings scattered about). The only reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is that the service wasn't great. It wasn't terrible, but it was bad enough that my lady brought it up to me and I agreed. Our server was easy on the eyes but didn't have a great attitude. Might as well have been a robot since she was so matter of fact and devoid of personality. She just looked like she was really unhappy to be there. She was a little slow with the check as well. In her defense it did seem like she was the only person serving the whole bar. Overall the experience was very positive though and I would definitely go here again.   TLDR:  -Good food. -Good drinks. -Clean bathroom. -Pretty good prices.  -Fun atmosphere.  -Service was lacking a bit."}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because they do not have one single thing on the menu that is gluten free. With a gluten free diet being so popular now days, I would think they would have at least a few items to offer. Otherwise it seems clean and comfortable. We ordered two ice teas. They seemed watered down and sort of bitter. I think the water that makes the ice must be pretty gross."}
{"text":"Been going here since it was mesa grill. After all is said and done the owners found a winner with this sports . 2 pool tables, beautiful bar, very easy to read simple and delicious menu.   Went here for sunday football and they have the sunday ticket with viewable screens and decent specials."}
{"text":"About the 5th or 6th new name this place has been under in about 3 years.  Decor is the only thing causing it to even get a star.     first off, doors say free wifi.  nope, only for the ordering system.  secondly, as first timers, asked what was good...EVERYTHING.  Asked about one item...\"I would not order that.\"  Too funny.  Of 2 orders, 1 correct 1 not.  Only one other table ordering food, so kitchen was not busy.  sandwich and side were wrong.  even got extra sides I did not want.  HINT:  only order the slaw if you REALLY like mayonnaise.   Correction...LOVE mayonnaise.  The recommended item was nothing to write home about at least not nicely.  Service was ok, had to ask multiple times about drinks, they were left at bar, forgotten.  Parking would be a problem if anyone was going there, very few spaces, but with all the open chairs it is a good fit  I think I'll just wait for the next version of this to open, can't see why we'd go back."}
{"text":"First (and last) visit here since it reopened as Mesa Sports Grill.  Stopped for lunch, and sat at the bar, waited five minutes before we even saw an employee.  There was only one other group of customers in the  place, but after we ordered, it took 20+ minutes to get our food.  The nachos were horrible, cold and disgusting.  Also had a chicken wrap which was sloppily made and pretty tasteless.  I certainly wouldn't go back for the food based on what I experienced.  While the ONE employee working front of the house was very pleasant, they weren't busy enough to justify the slow service and poor quality food.  Extra tip:  do not sit at the bar... There's an ice machine or compressor of some sort that is so loud,  you can't even carry on a conversation without shouting."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the games. Friendly staff TVs are everywhere. Pool tables, outside patio and awesome happy hour for football games!  Great atmosphere and very clean......Just a great place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice lunch spot with a decently diverse menu. The staff is friendly and generally helpful. It's nice to see the place trying different combinations until they find a winner :)"}
{"text":"We moved to this area two months ago and Chelsea always treats us right!! Service is great, sandwiches are great wings are awesome! atmosphere is fun Tons of TVs! Great place to hang out and watch your favorite game. We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Well. My girlfriend and I stopped in for wings and beer on a Saturday night. Our first bartender was a guy just drinking beer on the patio. We saw 7 people walk in and then immediately out. She straight told people they couldn't play pool and to leave. No one ever offered a menu -never coming back"}
{"text":"Definetly not the same place as few months ago.  Used to be a eatery-- now just a bar.  Not family friendly at all.  Food is terrible.  Not recommended in any way."}
{"text":"Cool little atmosphere. Food was not good at all and completely regretted coming here for food. I would maybe come back for drinks but that's about it."}
