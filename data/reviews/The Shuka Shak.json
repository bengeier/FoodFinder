{"text":"They're new, and don't even have a web site, but the food is good, the coffee is good, and the service is friendly and within a reasonable time."}
{"text":"This breakfast place was absolutely amazing! Very delicious foods all across the board, from the Shakshuka with hummus to the deep dish Chicago style pizza. I will recommend this place to everyone! Plus the prices are pretty reasonable!"}
{"text":"This was my final attempt, wanted to eat here for a late breakfast and made the 40 minute drive only to find them yet again closed in the middle of business hours. This has been the last 3 times that I have eaten here, they don't seem to be able to maintain normal hours."}
{"text":"I came here here last week with a friend from out of town. Service was great, they even asked how I'd like my shakshuka cooked. And they got it perfect. The shakshuka was excellent, my friend's omelette was great too. Service was great. Ambiance needs a little update, but that won't stop me from coming back. And they carried Snapple as well. Not many places in the area offer Snapple teas anymore. If you're looking for great food in the Phoenix area, definitely come by."}
{"text":"First time here with many more visits in the future The Shashuka with Hummus is yummmmy Comes with 3 poached eggs on top of a very tasty NY style Pizza sauce with Veggies mixed in plus Hummus and Warm Pita bread They also serve Breakfast Soup Pizza and desserts All kosher for many cultures and Foodies to enjoy This import from Israel is delicious so come and find out what I did already Its gooooood"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good tasting wraps and pizza. It's a little warm in here. Not sure if the AC was broken or if they just like it off. The tuna salad wrap with fries was tasty. It was freshly made and the tuna salad is made very well. Ingredients they used blend very well. They also sell desserts that are parve (non dairy) and they're surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Super slow to get the food, it's a small mom and pop shop. Coffee was awfully sour. Food was decent but set aside some time to get it-45 minutes to an hour- and we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast. I recommend this place to anyone who is hungry in the morning and wants a good meal to eat."}
{"text":"First time at The Shuka Shack. Ordered Shakshuka, fish and chips, deep dish Chicago pizza and a southern omelette. Everything was delicious. Brought the whole family to try out this place. Will recommend to all of my friends. 6 star quality breakfast."}
