{"text":"Came to an Yelp elite event. First thing I noticed, the music. So good to be in a place that doesn't feel like the Nationals of this city.  Had 2 free drinks - got the house cab sac. It was good. But it was house wine, so I wasn't expecting much. Also played connect four and jenga with cool ppl I met there.  They brought out a bunch of appies- tartare, ribs, cauliflower, and hot dog. All of them were dope! Very pleasantly surprised! My first time here, and I will def come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday afternoon lunch and drink. Brunch menu looked spectacular but chose The salt and pepper chickens wings with the onion rings as side. Everything was delicious! And I haven't even gotten to the fact it is Happy Hour all day Sunday!"}
{"text":"My partner and I visited Home and Away a few months ago while visiting 17th Avenue and thought the queso dip was by far the best we'd ever had. Unfortunately, living nowhere near 17th meant that it took awhile for us to get back to the restaurant.  After moving into the neighbourhood last week, we decided to head back - we were now living within walking distance of the queso! We could have that glorious melted cheese whenever we wanted! Alas, it was not meant to be, and after our experience, I'm not sure we'll be back.  It was early in the week, not very busy, there were two servers and a bartender on. We seated ourselves and then waited and waited for someone to come by with menus. The design of the place is a bit problematic, the booths cut a swath right down the middle of the restaurant and because they're so high, the sight lines for servers can't be very good. Finally, after about 10 minutes, one of the servers spotted us and brought menus over, listed the specials, and then told us our server would be right over. We waited another ten minutes and another server came over with menus, rattling off the specials again - even though we had menus in front of us already and were ready to order, glaring at us when we said the other server had filled us in.   We noticed that the queso was no longer on the menu and asked if it was still available. The server gave us this big, eye rolling sigh and tells us \"We haven't had that for three months now\" - as if we're complete idiots for not knowing that and not worth wasting her time on because we aren't regulars.   Needless to say, we were disappointed that such a great appy was off the menu, and even more so that we were ignored for 20 minutes and then  spoken to so condescendingly. This place had the potential to be our new regular haunt, but instead we opted to go down the street to Trolley 5 that night and the difference in customer service was like night and day.   If the queso makes it back onto the menu we might be back, but for now, we're choosing \"Away\" over \"Home.\""}
{"text":"I've worked in the industry for a couple years now so I always try to be sympathetic towards the staff, however in this circumstance it's hard to be even slightly compassionate. My friends and I came in on a Tuesday evening, and there were a total of 4 people sitting at the bar. We were promptly greeted and handed menus and then quickly forgotten. I watched our \"bartender\"  flip her blonde hair and stand at the opposite end of the bar joking around with another staff member, meanwhile looking over her shoulder and continuing to ignore us. After 20 minutes of being ignored we decided to leave and go to 1410. No one even noticed we were leaving. Not what I expected of this establishment at all."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot.  Has the best elements of a sports bar, pub and night club. The perfect balance. The prices are very reasonable, the staff is superb and the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"The Home Dog & quinoa salad are both super on point.  I could eat those on a weekly basis.  My wife loves the chicken sandwich.  Service is great and location too.  The other thing that's great is the fact that I can watch the Flames game or football in an environment that's just right while enjoying the awesome food.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Interesting new sports bar on 17th. It's big and spacious with pretty nice staff. Hostess was helpful and server actually remembered everything we ordered even though she didn't write any of it down. They have arcade games which is super fun and a few tvs scattered around. We ordered a few appies before the rest of our friends got there and they arrived as soon as they sat down. We got supreme fries, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, beef tartare, and popcorn shrimp. These were really good... I was surprised. Although the popcorn shrimp has actual popcorn on them, which they could have done without. We also got a bottle of the Malbec. Pretty good!  We ordered mains - Mac and cheese, Caesar salad, quinoa salad, hot dog, pulled chicken sandwich, and a burger... Expecting a great performance as the starters were so yummy... Kinda disappointed! Mac and cheese was so salty... The toppings added salt to the already salty cheese so I had to down a bunch of water after every bite. Caesar salad.. NOT what I was expecting. I guess I should have read the description more closely, since their menu isn't really a regular everyday pub menu so I guess it's my fault. The grilled romaine hearts were gross. Hard on one end and super soggy on the other from the dressing that wasn't very good. And the croutons...SO hard and chewy. And I usually love croutons :( Toasted quinoa salad.. Came in a jar, tons of quinoa.. Something I could make at home if I wanted to be boring. Burger.. Meh.. Pulled chicken.. Meh.. Hot dog was ok would maybe order it again. I don't think any of us finished our food. But we washed it all down with some more Malbec and some beer, so all good!  All in all, a good experience. We didn't leave hungry, but it was pretty expensive. May be back to check out their happy hour and try some more appies. And free games on Sundays! I think a Sunday funday is in order."}
{"text":"Went to 'Home & Away' for Friday night dinner with a buddy to see what the hype was about and it didn't disappoint!   Had the Cubano sandwich (hard to find in Calgary) with supreme fries and it as everything I hoped it would be... absolutely delicious. Also indulged in the PB&J brownie for dessert which was decadent.  Friendly & helpful staff, amazing food, cool local sports history motif, pro games on TV and fun arcade skeeball and basketball games... everything you need for a fun night out in YYC. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of pub-style food, so when my wife and her friend decided to go to Home & Away on a Sunday evening for dinner, my expectations were not very high.  I had the marinated quinoa, and it sure surprised me in a positive way. Perfectly cooked quinoa, with a tangy, limey tone and a selection of vegetables. Simple dish, but very tasty. And definitely above the concept of normal pub fare.  Good selection of beers as well (a few specials throughout the week, if I am not mistaken) and nice patio for summer. The selection of board and arcade-style games makes it a fun experience if coming in a group.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Home and Away. Above average pub experience."}
{"text":"Great overall feel, not a inch feels contrived. Truly a home grown product of Calgary."}
{"text":"Huge room, loud, carnival games available. Have been drinking here twice, but pleasantly surprised by Chorizo corn fritters on a late Monday night, which were really good ...Also check out the chicharrones.. like a sports bar with an artisanal side"}
{"text":"Sports, booze and pub food. The trifecta for a good time and you get all 3 at H&A. Here to watch a Jays game, we managed to snag 3 booths alongside the front so our big group could essentially sit together.  Our table ordered the beef tartare and the bucket of chicken (accompanied with mac n' cheese, coleslaw & house pickles) to share and it was the perfect amount of food for 5 people. The chicken was seasoned and fried, but not battered which I prefer more. The tartare was really good, however we had to ask a couple times for more bread because it didn't come with enough.  I understand it was exceptionally busy (pretty sure it was a full house) but we could barely get drinks steadily that we resorted to going to the bar directly.  Another downside, there are no foot rests on the booths or chairs. So your legs are dangling and after a couple hours, it starts to really get uncomfortable!   If their market is to get people to come and watch games on their plethora of TVs, and eat and drink during the duration of these long events - their seating and subpar service aren't helping their cause."}
{"text":"This spot could soon be one of my favourite on 17th Ave. Food was tasty and on top of that they have an awesome games section including skeeball and basketball, no change needed."}
{"text":"Waiter was too busy hitting on my friend to even offer me basic service.   Guess I'd have to be better looking (or bring less attractive friends) in order to get better service if I ever went here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this place out on a Friday after work - we were really excited to see what all the buzz was about and decided to go during the happy hour.... (Speaking of happy hour - we actually didn't get told any specials... boo.) The place was close to empty when we showed up and we got a booth facing the bar.  After deciding on some drinks, we took a look around... the place has such great potential but still doesn't feel like a sports bar... I felt like we were sitting in some franchise lounge, I wasn't a fan of the layout of the seating.   For food we decided to just share some items. The popcorn shrimp and tuna tostadas... these were both very disappointing. The batter on the shrimp was soooo thick and they deep fried actual popcorn into the batter, which made the kernels very hard. We ended up taking most of it off and just ate the shrimp. The tuna itself was pretty good, but the hard tortilla it was on made it very hard to eat.   As the night went on, it did get quite busy and our waitress actually started to ignore us while serving the tables beside us. It got so bad that one nice gentlemen at the table next to us noticed and told her when she brought their drinks over... all she said was \"oh I'm sorry I didn't know you two were still here\" how nice.  Anyways, the atmosphere was not exactly what I expected and I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant for dinner.  Really liked the atmosphere.  If your going later at night I would review it higher.  Food portions are quite small so therefore only 3 star."}
{"text":"What a fun place to hang with friends. Music is great, food is tasty and beers all around. Not to mention the skeeball and the basketball games on the side. All that with the great service made for an amazing night with the girls. :)"}
{"text":"So.....NFL opening weekend and no sound??? Ummm pardon. Aren't you a sports bar? And the \"$4 pints\" are 14oz...that's a sleeve - quit lying, pour a real pint and put on the sound."}
{"text":"This is the second time I got to try Home & Away. First time was Sunday funday drinks with girlfriends (and free arcade games) and the second time for a Yelp Elite event.   First off props to Dale for organising such a great Yelp event and to the amazing staff at Home & Away who made the evening even better than I could have hoped for.  We had open access to skee ball and basketball hoops as well as the giant connect 4 that Home & Away always have. Then there were the additional board games that were brought in. Battleship, Operation, Pirate in a barrel, Guess Who, Jenga, Hungry hippos? Yes please to all of these! Loved that everyone rotated through the games as much as possible.  Then there was the food. Plates of different items were brought out through the night and got to try some delicious items. Everything we tasted is on the regular menu and of course only makes me want to go back and try everything else they have.   1. Crispy cauliflower with chipoltle aiolo, queso fresco, and pico de gallo. Finally get why everyone is so intro cauliflower now. Very thin batter and crispy on the outside. Topping added great flavour. 2. Pork ribs that were fall off the bone soft and had a great glaze that enhanced the flavour of the meat instead of overpowering it. Also saw this as a main dish go out to a customer in the restaurant and was impressed with the size of the rib portion and the 2 sides it came with. 3. Hot dogs - and if you know me you know I love hot dogs, this was a great one. This will be the first thing I order when I go back. This is no ordinary hot dog though, it is a wagyu beef dog with pepper jelly, dijon aioli and some pickled onion. They had cut ours into mini dogs so not sure how large the full portion is but guess at pretty decent 4. And then there was the beef tartare. Oh man so good! They do the tartare with a deviled egg aioli, and honestly I am not sure how they do it but they do it right. Served on little crisp toast bits of heaven. I liked these even more than the hot dog and I loved the hot dog.  As mentioned I had been here once before for Sunday drinks with girlfriends and only got to try the chorizo corn fritters (which were great) and now I wish I had gone more hungry cause I realise all the great food I missed out on! Couple of other items I saw people order off the menu and looked really good were the nachos, wings, mac & cheese, and pulled pork sandwich. All looked really tasty and great size portions. They have done some great thing s with traditional pub fare and even their salads look interesting - nice spins on the originals.  In regards to service, the team that served us was on it, knowledgeable and very friendly. This was a very unusual event for them to have with so many of us milling around and playing games but they handled it like pros. You could see how busy they were but if there was a question they took the time to answer it for you and had a good knowledge of the beers on tap too which is always a bonus. This is a big space and on a regular night if it gets busy the team will be working hard to make sure everything runs right.  Home & Away does brunch on the weekend, has great daily features on food and wine (you can see them on their menu online), weekday happy hour from 3-6pm, and has a kids menu for the little people. Really covering all the bases and doing a fine job.  Am I coming back? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday to check it out and play some free skeeball. We had planned on eating there, but the menu was too eccentric for us and the prices were high for what I would call a 'pub'. When I go to a pub, I want traditional pub food, not odd creations with exaggerated ingredients.  We wanted to play skeeball which is free on Sundays, but we had to go ask someone how it worked. Finally someone came over and took some loonies out of one machine to put into the ones we wanted to play. We played one game and wanted to play more, but nobody was around to provide change so I guess we were done. That was disappointing. Our server was good and very friendly. The beer was well priced. Overall I was not impressed so it's doubtful that I will return."}
{"text":"Jumping on the bandwagon of $16+ menu items in town, which urks me a little, but if the food is good, I don't mind.   Started with a couple of boring tuna tacos. Then I got the braised pork cubano with fries. It was really boring, I shared the 2nd half with everyone else at the table who agreed. The fries were good, though!  It's too bad. I'm always looking for new places with good food.  Back to the Ship where the food is $8 and the pints are 20 oz."}
{"text":"Last week I was in town to take in the NY Rangers vs Calgary Flames game.  Stumbled upon this place while looking for a Greek restaurant and I decided to give it a try.    Soon as I walked in I was blown away by the set up.      The bartender kept bringing drinks my way without having to ask & the Cuban sandwich hit the spot.  Jordan the manager was very cool.  Dropped everything and told me what places are good to go see & even recommended me a good place to go to when in Edmonton (since I was going there later that week for a Rangers Oilers game)  Very thankful to Jordan and the staff at Home and Away.   Next time I come back to Calgary; I'll be visiting this place again.     Till next time guys Lou from NY"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect from this place. All of the projects the owners have done previous to this were fantastic but neither group had done a \"sports bar\". I am not a fan of sports bars generally. Bad food, bad drinks and a clientele that leaves something to be desired. Home and Away has blown the typical \"sports bar\" out of the water. First, the staff actually care. They have hostess (or host) always at the door to greet you. Then they are super fast with menus and telling you about specials and whatever sport game is on (I didn't care but very nice to know). The have great wine and cocktails that we sampled a few of and then decided on food. Now sports bar food is generally an after thought. It's meant to keep people sober enough to watch more sports and keep buying beer, so that means salty and greasy and generally thrown into a plastic basket. This place couldn't be more different. We ordered the wings, the hot dog and the cauliflower. Figured those were, for the most part, pretty typical \"sports bar\" foods. Each dish was so thought out, well balanced and plated beautifully. The wings are incredible. Served with house pickled peppers and brined in house. Makes them juicy and so tender but are perfectly fried. I can't wait to come and try the weekly wing feature. Apparently they do a different flavor every week. The cauliflower is what blew me away. I've had a lot of cauliflower dishes this year and most are flavorless and bland. This is popping with flavor and even with the queso and aioli, tastes so fresh and light. Now the hotdog. I wish they would open a stand so I can get this everywhere, all the time. Perfect balance of salty and sweet, with the pepper jelly balancing the salty wagyu dog. The food here is amazing and worth every penny. I am always all for a place that's willing to spend the time making fresh, homemade food and actually care. The fun games, wall of skateboards and great music make this place somewhere I will be spending a lot of time. Welcome to 17th! Can't wait to check out your brunch."}
{"text":"I won't let my whole disappointing Canada trip influence this too badly, but I'm convinced the Alberta province has no concept of customer service.   After checking in to our hotel, we were some very hungry travelers. We looked at Zomato, Yelp, and a local magazine and finally settled on Home & Away.  We were seated quickly, although we got funny looks because apparently this is a \"locals\" spot. That's cool, I can dig that.   Very cool atmosphere - beer pong tables, giant Connect4 table games, cornhole outside, and the floor is old basketball court boards! Nice!! I'm a big sports fan, so this was setting up quite nicely.  They have a pretty random menu assortment. All sports themed. The fried chicken thrown in halfway seemed random. I really wanted it, but in the theme of the place, I was really eyeing the hot dog.   Our food came fairly quickly. The beer selection was wonderful (and inexpensive).   The part that really sucked was the service. Our waitress was having way more fun flirting with the college \"bros\" out on the patio. After we finished our food and beers and indicated to her that we didn't need anything else, we waited over 30 minutes for our check. In a new city to us, that's precious daylight time to explore. Instead, we stared at bros flirting and trying to flex. It was pathetic. We could've walked out without paying as none of the staff seemed to pay any attention to us. You're lucky we have integrity, H&A!"}
{"text":"For half price wings ($14 regular) and $4 pints of beer (Calgary brewed only) on Tuesdays, I give Home and Away 4 stars. The wings are local and good quality chicken, crispy and tasty. $4 bucks for Banded Peak Summit Seeker? Yes please! However Cuban sandwich was missing ingredients, the bun was cold and small, and the meat was too salty."}
{"text":"On my walk home today from downtown, I got stuck in the rain storm, as I was passing Home & Away the door opened for me and I ran in.   I have avoided stopping in here as my first experience months ago, wasn't that positive.   One of the owners (I don't want to spell his name wrong, but his beard kicks ass) took the time to talk to me as we watched the rain storm.   I shared with him my first experience wasn't great and he immediately wanted to change my opinion.   He offered to buy me a snack or lunch, I ordered the Cauliflower with chipotle aioli. I throughly enjoyed it.  The cauliflower was cooked perfectly and not over breaded. I couldn't finish it all as the portion size was big.   I'm pleased - I will certainly be back for the Tragically Hip live stream on August 20/2016"}
{"text":"In short, it's another generic sport bar.Come back Moxies, all is forgiven. TLDR: Pros: Competent service, Spacious, Nice view out if seated facing 17th Cons: Ambitious pricing for underwhelming small portions, Atrocious acoustics,Unwise decision of garage open doors means dust, heat, flies and exhaust come inside, Yet another 'Sports' theme venue, Architect needs to be taken outside and shot.  Went here with the girly during stampede, to check out the old Moxies. Seated quickly, sparse customers, but not what one would call bare. Waitress was competent. Noticed it was obviously a 'sports' bar but took a moment to realise there was something odd about the theme. Yep. It's made to feel and look like you are essentially sitting in the bleachers at your old high school gymnasium/basketball court inside. Complete with wooden floors and various sporty props. Theres some throwing ball hoop machines of some kind off at the end. Waitress informed was owned by the same people that ran Una, Craft Beer Market and Commonwealth. Server mentioned the '3 tacos for X' special. I like a bit of heat to my food now & again, & waitress said that yes it does have quite the kick. Arrived- turns out 'Laura C' was right in her review: \"Jumping on the bandwagon of $16+ menu items in town\".   The 3 'tacos' arrived. My eyes narrowed. You gotta be kidding me. 3 tiny tacos, about 4\" across, with a blob of beef etc. What are they feeding? Mice? I could have got more food at TACO BELL for less. The last time I got that 'this has to a joke right?' feeling was at the current champions of joke portions, Sultans Tent ($16 for a miserly bowl of steamed veg). I don't think Yelp allows lets $ be stated but trust me it's on the 'WTF' level.Now, these weren't 'tacos' in the classic sense. No no. They tried to jazz it up by placing them flat on the plate and piling the blob of ingredients on top. Like 3 mini plates say. I didn't know tacos came that small. They weren't folded, I imagine being that small not worth folding. Look, Home & Away folks, its nice that you're trying to 'Teatro' up the presentation here, but really. Don't bother. You aren't fooling anyone. Joey Tomatoes does that too. (although they hire stunning waitresses to fake flirt with you to distract you from the average food) If it's just normal good basic pub food, make it as such. Doing this just highlights just how small the portions are. Normally I don't like making a fuss, (just grit my teeth & never come back)& I guess the waitress saw my composure crack a little when I said 'no its fine!'. I felt bad for her. I think she could tell I was unimpressed at the gerbil level portions for the money asked.   On the plus side, the beef was very nice, but as for the spice/heat level, ive had better eating a zinger chicken at KFC. Not exactly bland, but just 'meh' overall. I don't need a fire extinguisher in mouth experience, but if one is going to say it has a kick, then give it a damn kick. Or at least rate the heat level in the menu so customers who want mild to v hot don't get disappointed. I inhaled the 3 tiny scraps of beef on the little mini discs quickly, part way through asking the waitress if they have any franks red hot or similar. No, she said, but they have an in house made hot sauce. Okay, was going to get that. It was 50c. I prevaricated, trying to put on a brave face, realising I would look cheap by refusing, but at the same time thinking why should I pay extra on principle on condiments that should be 'free' (read costed into the overall prices). I declined. Had feeling server sensed I was disappointed.  Really? Really Home & Away? What next? Nickel and dimeing people for putting salt and pepper on the tables? I mean Jesus! Just buy catering sizes of Franks Red Hot xtra hot, fill the little bottles in the condiment basket and call it a day. Check please! Perhaps the 2 starter vouchers with the bill was some kind of peace offering but didn't take them as won't be back. The server girl tried her best, & no fault on her so paid the 15% and got the hell out, pop over to the A & W up the road, as was still hungry.   The premises is a disaster in execution. The theme-if you can call it that- has managed to take a perfectly nice cosy layout of the previous tenant & drag it downwards. Windows ripped out to plonk in open garage doors that lets in noise, heat, car exhaust, insects and god knows what else. Must be the same morons that thought the 'Trolley 5' layout was a good idea. The 'decorative' -no ceiling look- rafters/pipes/vents are unfinished and slovenly. The acoustics are atrocious. The groups owners seem to have a bizarre fetish for making their venues sound as bad as possible. *cough-Craft Beer Market-cough* Acoustic consultants must shake their heads when they walk in here.Terrible value, almost juvenile decor and sports on TV's everywhere...again. You can get this almost anywhere in Calgary, for LESS. \"Nothing to see here citizens, move along, nothing to see...\""}
{"text":"SO after much hype decide to check this place out with a few girlfriends 1) the place is huge yet so much wasted empty space so waited 30 minutes for  a table 2) waitress did not seem to know what any special were and we all waited for sides of friends to come after mains were served 3) burger was meh, small nothing I would say is worth $18 I think this will have  a great patio come summer but as far as a sports bar I sure wouldn't want to watch the game there, a few TV's and the basketball game is noisy as heck"}
{"text":"Home & Away is a good option for watching the game and enjoying some bar snacks. Their beer specials during the week are a great price and they, of course, have different happy hour specials throughout the week. They have some fun games inside as well which I often see people playing but I am usually too busy visiting...and drinking... to make my way over. They have a really fun popcorn chicken item which is literally popcorn shrimp. Large, tasty shrimp covered in actual popcorn. Their tacos and pickles are other crowd pleasing items from my visits."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about how I ended up at Cluck n' Cleaver for brunch.   After trying delicious samples at the Yelp event, I had high hopes for H&A's brunch. I even had a 2 for 1 brunch coupon. What could go wrong?   To start, I'm 99.9% sure our server was hungover. She was slow, unalert and looked tired. Additional evidence for my suspicions included her forgetting my tea and our cutlery.   There wasn't much choice on the brunch menu. I got the braised pork eggs benny with potato hash (the cubed kind) and V got the pan roasted potato cake (the shredded, Denny's kind). It came with chorizo sausage, and poached egg on top. All our poached eggs were overcooked, not runny and unseasoned. V's potato cake was NOT seasoned and was watery. H&A should watch more YouTube cooking videos because any half decent cook will tell you to taste your food for seasoning, which H&A obviously forgot to do. They should also take some pointers from Denny's for how to make proper shredded potato hash (squeeze the water out!!)   My eggs Benny was disappointing. The potatoes weren't fresh and the pork was dry. I left 80% of my plate uneaten. Another server brought out 4 orders of eggs Benny for a different table and I thought, \"You poor souls! Save yourselves!!\"   We eventually told Ms. Hangover we weren't happy with our meal. The manager took care of of the bill and gave us more coupons for next time. I sincerely hope he passed on our criticisms to the chefs because I won't be returning for brunch. We ended up at Cluck n Cleaver afterwards to fill the remaining space in our bellies.   Now to leave on a good note: the regular menu is delicious. They have an amazing beer selection and staff are friendly. The take home lesson is their brunch sucks."}
{"text":"Our department decided to have lunch here. My first impressions: spacious, lively, and bright. I ordered a lamb burger-it was moist, tender, and delicately seasoned-with a side of cream of cauliflower soup that had apple bits and cheddar in it! Service was prompt and attentive, and my coffee was even refilled without my asking. As sports bars go, looking good."}
{"text":"I've met up with friends at H&A quite a few times and have always had a blast. The food, atmosphere, decor, and service is always great. And the games kick-ass...will definitely be back there when I'm in Calgary next."}
{"text":"This place used to be Moxie's, it is a big restaurant with plenty of patio sitting to enjoy those summer evenings. I was surprised and delighted to find out they also have some games like connect four, basketball and skee ball. You can bring the connect four board to your table, so you don't even need to move to the games area. This is a fantastic idea because it adds more entertainment other than the usual drinking and eating :P Kitchen is open late, so you can still go and order food. Music is not too loud so you can still chat with your friends without the need to shout. This is overall a good place and I will be coming back for sure :-)"}
{"text":"$7 for wings on Tuesday and extra $1 for the ranch sauce. I personally do liked the wings. I got home style wings all for myself. It was good. It did have a hint of spice to it but it wasn't too spicy. There are 3 wings to choose from but every Tuesday they have a different flavor and according to the server, it never repeats itself.  This bar used to be Moxies. But I do find this place pretty cool. Very sporty. Definitely has the look of a sport bars.   Cool will come back. Also highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. Excellent burger, fries, beer (house lager from Big Rock but lots more on tap/in bottles), service, space, seating, and sound level is comfortable for conversation. End to end a class act. I was there for lunch and it was packed with actual grownups, not a dude bro in sight."}
{"text":"Wow what a great concept yet there is zero sound for the game .. it's an opening NFL Sunday and I'm listening to AC/DC rather then the game commentary . Sucks"}
{"text":"The food is good as is the service. The patio is alright but you naturally deal with all the noises as well as bachelor parties walking by. There was an entertaining crowd in there when we went in. There's an array of games in there to play while waiting if that is your thing. The food is pretty limited but quite excellent in particular the angus burger. You can tell the beef is prime quality and whatever the sauce is amazing. The prices are what you would expect. There's a ton of seating so that isn't generally a problem. They could probably have more attentive wait staff though at least on the patio."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and ordered fried chicken and the mac & cheese. Waited for more than 45 minutes and the food came out cold. The service was slow and it was not even busy. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying, great concept!  I've always longed for an adult Chuck E. Cheese (with better food of course).  Home & Away is situated on the west end of 17th Ave SW, where the old Moxie's used to be.  Upon first entering we were greeted to a smiling, happy face who promptly came up to us to greet us and was eager to help.  We were here for a Yelp event and so we found our way pretty fast.  The theme here is sports but not a sports bar per se.  You can watch games on their TVs and they have a number of skee-ball and basketball games.  The bar is quite large with many stools to sit.  The layout is great and maximizes the number of bar-height tables vs. dining-height tables.  I was able to chat Amy about reservations and they do take them.  However, expect to arrive early on weekends as they don't really accept reservations after 6:30pm.  Amy was a pleasure to chat with and it looks like they are in good hands with the staff there.  As for the food, the ribs are AMAZING!  They are fall off the bone good, with the right amount of BBQ sauce; the sauce isn't dripping and overpowering.  The sauce has a nice subtle sweetness to it.  Their waygu beef hot dog is a nice take on the regular ballpark dog.  It works well with the hint of jelly they add.  The buns that come with the dog are soft and warm, like they just came out of a steam bath.  All in all a great place to have a drink, have some food and converse with some friends.  Just a warning, the music was turned up a bit much so to chat you'll have to raise your voice to almost shouting volume."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, cool design, not cheap but not expensive prices, poor service (disinterested waitress).  Lots of stuff On the menu looked good. Would come again."}
{"text":"Waitress brought a water, a beer and a food menu, but never returned to ask if I wanted to order food....I looked around on the patio and almost no one had food...I completely finished my beer by the time she came back to ask if I wanted another. By that time I just wanted to leave even though I was hungry. Probably better off anyway, as nothing on the menu looked that appetizing. Went across the street and had lunch there instead. The place is large and I liked the idea of having some games for people to play and stuff...But it definitely comes off as more of a place to get hammered than actually eat food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the food was innovative and delicious.  We had 3 kids and it was a great environment for us."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight for dinner with a baby and friend.   Be sure to give them your plate for free parking in the back.  The food was tasty,  typical pub type fare.   I had a cuban sandwich with salad and it was very enjoyable.   The place wasn't busy so service was excellent.   They were very friendly.  Will definitely come back to try the brunch"}
