{"text":"It's the best coffee in Kensington.  They do good espresso drinks, but are also set up for pour-over and aero press.    Great selection of locally roasted beans, including Rave coffee from Canmore.    Always amazed to see the line of lemmings going to Starbucks for a machine made cup of burnt coffee.    Try the Coffee Market!"}
{"text":"They provide an extensive variety of coffee gadgets and K-cups while serving up top notch espressos. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"If you need some coffee, or a machine to make coffee, or some k-cups or beans or pods or glasses or espresso machines or bodums or anything to do with coffee, this place probably has it. They have some nice non-plastic coffee presses (glass and bamboo) as well as some cool hookah looking things and double-walled glass coffee cups.   There are a few tables for enjoying your coffee inside, with local art on the walls and a small selection of baked items to go with your coffee.   But how is the brewed coffee? Consistently great. At least the five mornings I tried it. Better than most, whether latte or plain. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Um YES. Just what Kensington needed. Surprisingly in this area proper coffee shops are few and far between. This place is relaxed, comfortable, perfectly lit, not too loud and makes a great cup of coffee.   It's short on food options, but it's only recently been converted from primarily retail coffee supplies.  Also the staff are refreshingly friendly, which alone makes this place stand out from its less friendly but better known competition just a block away."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere here, great music, great service and great coffee. The cold dirty chai was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Now called Kienna Coffee Roasters this is one of Calgary's best kept secrets. If you like coffee, this is a gem. The coffee is (in my opinion) best in the city, the staff is friendly, the surroundings comfortable, and the location convenient."}
{"text":"As a brand new addition to Kensington, this local coffee biz looks to be getting off the ground and is getting me into the grounds - coffee grounds that is! Wow... that joke was bad, even by my standards. Maybe I've had to much coffee? Nope. Not a thing!   Anyway, you know how most coffee shops focus mostly on serving in-house coffee and just have a small amount of coffee related retail products for purchase? The Coffee Market takes this idea and spins it the other way around.   Retail is their main focus and they have all the products you need to make a seriously tasty cuppa joe at home using whichever brewing method satisfies you. IKEA Expedit shelves line the walls, chock-full of of every colour and style of Bodum French press, Aero presses, countertop espresso machines and a selection of grinders from hand crank ceramic burr grinders to super fancy.  If you're into KCups, they have a million kinds of them and if that's an exaggeration, they have at least 150+ (it says on their sign). If you're a Keurig fiend, they will probably have a coffee that you enjoy. If you like the ease of your Keurig but hate the huge amounts of garbage they create, they've got these little pre-filled filter bag things (kind of like a tea-bag filled with local Kienna coffee that you can easily stick into a reusable cup. Very cool!  Rob, the owner, is awesome! Like they say in their about the biz section, he's always happy to chat with you and he's got a really wonderful, all-inclusive attitude when it comes to coffee. He's not the kind of guy that would get at all elitest on you if you say you like one brewing method or roast over another. He's plenty knowledgeable about his products and seems happy to share an honest opinion while respecting yours. Seems simple, doesn't it? Surprisingly enough, this can often be a difficult thing for some coffee aficionados, but Rob and his store really excel in being friendly!   For the whole bean lovers out there (like me), I did find there isn't as much selection as I would expect. My first time in, I was expecting to walk into a flavour wonderland full off all the best beans roasted locally from around the world - a full on \"Coffee Market,\" if you will.   I would love to see some sort of way that I could experience the beans before buying them. Little sniffer jars of beans next to the bags, expresso samples, something. It seems they currently only carry one line of coffee, it's locally roasted and delicious, but most coffee shops carry at least one line of roasts and I was hoping to find a bit more.  Their retail selection is really solid and looks to be their main focus, but for a guy like me who already has the stuff to brew at home, a greater non-KCup coffee selection would keep me excited and in the store once a week to try a new bag of beans, as well as keep the Coffee Market in my mind for whenever I inevitably break yet another French press. I've got my fingers crossed, something like this is in the works! :D  Welcome to the hood, Rob and The Coffee Market. Thanks for keeping me caffeinated!"}
{"text":"If you are close to Kensington, go try this place out, support a local independent business and try some Authentic coffee that you will not find in any chain brewery! They import their coffee directly from their own sponsored plantations in Haiti. Buy a bag of coffee and you will sponsor a tree you can go online and track!  Definitely recommended!"}
