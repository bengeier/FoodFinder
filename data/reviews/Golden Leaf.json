{"text":"My lady and I were stuck for dinner not long ago, so we placed a call to the Golden Leaf on 37th St SW. 
We ordered the Dinner for Two ($23.95), which consists of 2 spring rolls, Beef & Mixed Veg, Sweet & Sour Chicken Balls, chicken fried rice, and fortune cookies. Food was ready in just over a half hour, and was piping hot. The portions were more than generous - we had leftovers for days - and all the dishes had a nice balance of flavors. I think that next time I would order a la carte instead, as the Beef & Mixed Vegetables didn't do much for me - I prefer all my Chinese food to be deep fried and covered in sauce. 
Like most Chinese restaurants, they are closed on Mondays, but open Sundays and holidays to compensate. Don't plan on heading there for a romantic meal - it's pick up or delivery only."}
{"text":"We order take out/delivery here every could of months. The food is absolutely delicious. We usually get the combos they have where you get to pick a certain amount of entrees with wonton soup, rice and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Top notch food!  Hot, fast delivery.  Always consistently reliable!  Family dinner made easy!"}
{"text":"I just ordered and the only thing that is right is that it was fast.  Delivery boy forgot plates and cutlery as I asked for them as we are at a hotel and after specifying we have a nut allergy, I was told they have no nuts in their restaurant and the chicken celery dish has Cashews in it?!?  Come on.  We're from Edmonton, but Calgary you can do better!!!"}
{"text":"I order from here often enough because I live on campus. The wor won ton is a staple, several different kinds of meat and veggies in a tasty broth, and they give you two containers, so you have left overs.
The chow main is also really good because it's not as heavy and greasy as chow mien often is, it's cooked in more of a broth than oil. 
I'm not a huge fan of Chinese so I don't eat it often, but I always make sure to order from here when I do."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed good Chinese food but I must tell you that the quality of food here is not the best."}
