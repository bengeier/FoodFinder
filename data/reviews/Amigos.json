{"text":"I mainly go to Amigos for their 2 for 1 wing night because I love their wings. They are a good size and cooked well. I also love the buffalo chicken wrap when I don't feel like wings. And without a doubt, I always get an order of lattice fries, they are amazing! I don't know if it's because they are different and you won't find them at many restaurants but they are so addictive. Their regular fries are just as good and don't forget the ranch dip for the fries. Considering there isn't much in the area as far as restaurant dining goes, this is a pretty good option and they have a big menu. If you are up early their breakfast special is great too! This place is not bad for watching sports either they have a projector screen and tvs. The crowd can be interesting at times, but overall the food is good."}
{"text":"Cajun wings were terrible as they were extremely salty. 
The last two times I came here with my friends and family, we ended up leaving because the servers refused to come by our table and take our orders.

Stay away from this place, the owners and staff are racist! Never wasting my time coming here again."}
{"text":"this tequila bar is located just outside the entrances to both Fuego Steakhouse and Amigos Mexican restaurant.  We each enjoyed a house margarita and orders of Southwestern crab cakes with a chipolte sauce.  There was probably more filler than crab meat with the chipolte sauce adding most of the flavor."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great vibe. Attractive prices. What more do you want from a local pub?"}
{"text":"PERMANENTLY CLOSED!

Unfortunately, the Amigo's at Fiesta Henderson has followed the demise of its sister restaurant at Sunset Station, and closed-down as of October 2017.

The food was generally pretty good, the chips & salsa bar were great, but as someone who dined there several times a month over the past couple years, it was obvious over the past year or so that other than the 5PM rush, there just wasn't enough business to sustain operations.     In retrospect, it seemed like for the final couple weeks, servers were aware that the end was near.

Hate to see it go, but the reality is there are many other good to great Mexican restaurants around, and I'm eager to see what restaurant concept eventually fills the space that Amigo's occupied.   I thought the Mexican restaurant was a good fit for both Fiesta Henderson & Sunset Station, but apparently I was wrong.   

Hopefully the space won't be filled with more slot machines!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular for breakfast on weekdays and it's amazing considering its only 3.99 for the special! Staff is nice and friendly. They also have really good lunch and dinner as well. Service is average. Would recommend if you are in the area! Very affordable as well."}
