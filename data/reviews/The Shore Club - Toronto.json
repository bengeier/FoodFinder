{"text":"Beautiful ambiance.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  Servers were very professional, though we went at lunch on a weekday it was not full at all. There were literally 5 people in the restaurant.  I will definitely go again but probably for dinner on the weekend."}
{"text":"This place is great for ambiance and atmosphere. The service was superb and the peach sangria was phenomenal. Unfortunately the food is just OK. The mashed potatoes were not smooth or creamy, the Caesar salad came out with three full romaine leafs and the steak was dry. For the high price of the food, I was hoping for melt in your mouth food but I definitely did not get that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh seafood and delicious steak. Service was great, from hostesses to the servers. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Avoid! Based on my experience, both the service and the food are subpar.  Service was slow. The waitress did not smile even once. She also interrupted our service several times to go pour wine for several gentlemen at the next table, who were either regulars or more eligible for service as they were wearing suits... Wow!  I went to The Shore Club with two friends. They both ordered the lobster bisque, which was too salty. I ordered a calamari, which was again too salty. It also tasted more like fried breaded mix than squid. As of my main dish, I ordered a grilled ahi tuna. I asked for it to be rare, which any decent chef would already know to prepare rare. The ahi tuna steak came fully cooked, at what I would describe as well done. There could be three reasons for this. 1. They do not follow the customer's directions on how to prepare the food. 2. The cut of tuna was not fresh and they were afraid I would get sick if it was served rare. Or 3. They don't know that tuna steak is not usually prepared fully cooked. Not to mention, just my main dish was $44. It was the worst ahi tuna steak I have ever had.  I would have been fine with the terrible service if the food was at least half decent. You are better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Happy hour at The Shore Club in the bar/ lounge area is incredible. The specials are primo! No wonder the place gets packed."}
{"text":"I was there as my 'last day farewell' get together. he food was good, but the service was probably one of the worst I had. Our server was very impatient and rude. My  coworker pointed out she served us when we went there the first time and she was rude then too. I've had some great service there, but she was unbelievable. Perhaps because there was an automatic 18% she felt she didn't need to do her job. When another server came i said, \"you're not our server\" because she was nice.. and my coworker pointed out, \"yeah.. she's smiling\".  I've had their burger and mac and cheese a few times and it's superb! Although their burger is $20, if you have it once in a while, it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"A group us (12 people) went there for lunch last month. From the time we sat down, it took them at least one hour for the food to be delivered to our table. The problem was the inexperienced waiter who got her priority wrong. She came and asked us to place drinks, twice. Empty all wine glasses next before she ordered food for us. when we told her few of us had to leave earlier and we wanted food to be delievered sooner, but she came back and asked again not realizing all of us had one hour lunch break..Although the remainer of the food were finally cooked, she brought them out ALL together ONE HOUR later (they don't have to be). During this period of time while we liked to chat with each other, but she came to clean the bread crumbs on the table which we almost wanted to tell her to leave as that particular gathering was for one of our friend who left us for good. So, time was prestigious for us but she couldn't get this. In all, we wasted a great deal of time waiting for the food to arrive and we didn't enjoy the food as much. We understand the club is new but the waiter do require to be trained well.  Nikita"}
{"text":"Was here for winterlicious on the weekend. Service is excellent.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The food was great. We had the potato and leek soup, coffee crusted Manhattan, and the sorbet."}
{"text":"This has become my favourite lunch indulgence. I've been here about a dozen times in the past year, hosting colleagues from overseas to having a late night dessert fix after the theatre (fantastic coconut cream pie plus the BEST cappuccino with the lightest & frothiest foam).  The food is largely impressive - the simplest dishes are delicious (e.g. just tried their Caesar salad, a dish I don't normally order).   Service is efficient and refreshingly unpretentious."}
{"text":"Great after-work specials in the bar area -- its worth the quick walk over from the financial district. Service can be a bit slow at times, but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great place!  I have made a few trips to this location!  I highly recommend the \"Open face Burger\".  In my opinion, the best burger i have tried....next to my home made recipe of course!  Being a burger snob, I have seen the Toronto Life magazines top burgers ranking and other rankings from other site and have agreed with some reviews.  This burger has trumped my previous #1 choice.  A must try!"}
{"text":"They don't like people who come for summerlicious. Water barely refilled, too many people serve and clean up the table, bus boy seems to try to break all the plates that he is taking, service is extremely slow. Attitude galore. Food was just over mediocre but the dessert was good. Not sure this is the way to woo people to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best...  the chef is in love with mayo and oil Duo Tatar tasted old and too oily... Beer salad was a Caesar salad with a few beers on top and whole lot of mayo!!! Greasy \"feature fish\" which was a tasteless Char and lots and lots of oil... fish taste old...  and the cheese cake I was hoping to add a sweat ending to it all was also old... And it's only Tuesday!  Service was not great...   It's a diners experience with a facade of a posh restaurant and prices that don't worth at all. There are many other options nearby that would be a much better experience.  Absolute disappointment!"}
{"text":"Nice relaxing atmosphere with service that is friendly...   I would say the food is very tasty and I've  tried many things on the menu. I'm a big fan of the macadamia encrusted halibut very light and fluffy but full of flavor. I like to take advantage of the specials from 4-7pm and 10-12am. This is probably one of the main reasons I go to shore club so often. Oysters are $1 each prawns are $2 each and for drinks $5 pints of Sapporo and $7 glass of wine. Overall just having a few drinks oyster and prawns late one night makes for an inexpensive night in a fancy and classy place.   Enjoy I know I do :)"}
{"text":"I was here for the happy hour (buck a shuck, prawns for $2 and $5 beer and $7 white or red wine). This is a classy and stylish place, great decor and atmosphere. Staff are professional and friendly.  I work in the next building so TSC is my go to place while I work in down town core. I will definitely come back many more time. Try this place if you haven't already you will love it."}
{"text":"Great place for apps or a small meal in the bar. We had 1$ oysters and a great tomato and stilton salad"}
{"text":"Can only speak about the happy hour but this is a great spot!   Grab some oysters and prawns and be prepared to wait a bit at the bar for a table (it's first come first serve in the lounge) but it's a great atmosphere and the beer specials are great!"}
{"text":"came here for summerlicious 2013. honestly i have been staying away from summerlicious/winterlicious because the last couple rounds have been such a disappointment including the ever popular Canoe.  The Shore Club was amazing. Great service, everyone was on top of everything, nice decor, good dinner music and most importantly amazing food.   we ordered the tomato and goat cheese salad, chilled corn soup, striploin as the main, an extra side of tempura onion rings and sorbet and chocolate brownie for dessert.   the tomato and goat cheese salad was to die for!! seriously generous portions of goats cheese.mmmmm The chilled corn soup was good too. Except it would have been amazing had it not been chilled.  we both loved our steaks. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. The spiced mushrooms as a side were so tasty.  the tempura onion rings... well i wouldnt call it tempura batter. dont get me wrong, it was good but it was the run of the mill onion ring. thankfully not greasy.  the sorbet triage was delicious and the chocolate browny was warm, moist, soft yet flaky all at the same time. truly amazing.  i would definitely recommend this place and most importantly definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting the Shore Club. What a wonderful experience we had! As a couple of young professionals we were looking for a fun but elegant night out. As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the friendly staff who quickly checked our jackets for us. The environment is wonderful and decor is beautiful.   The meal was incredible with our steaks cooked just the way we wanted them. Not one single thing to complain about when it comes to the food. Everything was fast, fresh and absolutely delicious.   The highlight of our experience was our waiter Sean! This guy was the perfect blend of professional, knowledgable, fun and witty. He knew the menu in and out, was able to suggest things we wouldn't have thought of, joked and played but was truly professional through the whole meal. If you come to this restaurant for the great food and atmosphere say hi to Sean and tip him good.   Nothing but great things and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Shore Club is most certainly the best lunch spot in the financial district hands down. The service is top notch, their staff is very professional and tactful. The menu selection is large enough to please most tastes, which is why this is my #1 choice for business lunches. Their table set-up allows for enough privacy and the place is generally quiet with very quiet music in the background.  Food-wise I usually go with either steak salad, fish tacos, lobster Cobb salad or lobster roll. The portions are generous and I find it a very good value for your money. Yes the mains will set you at $18-$25 per course but your are getting the freshest never frozen seafood and steaks.  You can confidently take your clients here for lunch and I can assure you they will be very impressed and pleased!"}
{"text":"Hubby loves steak, I love seafood. This place seemed a perfect match!  I had high hopes of being blown away...alas, it didn't happen.  The decor is outdated, albeit being a newer restaurant. I think they were going for older, conservative clientele?  Service was beyond excellent. Unobtrusive, smooth, knowledgeable.  The menu is not inventive, exciting or progressive. It reads like Canyon Creek.  We ordered:  Oysters - they are what they are. Either you love them or not. I was happy with my west coast choice. Accompaniments are mignonette, horseradish and seafood cocktail sauce.  Calamari - old fashioned style, crispy, tastes of flour, not enough squid, small pieces. Reminded me of Just Greek calamari.  Scallop & Prawn Ceviche - the pieces are not diced, rather massive pieces piled on top of each other. Not the greatest taste, had better.   Lobster Bisque - very nice flavour but only 2 teeny tiny pieces of lobster floating around. For $18, I expected more.  Beet Salad - lettuce, beets, goat cheese, pecans. The lettuce didn't belong there. Had better at lesser calibre restaurants  Wedge salad - massive wedge of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese. Nothing innovative here. Boring.  New York strip loin - total disappointment. Although it was 10oz, it was on the thinner side, gristly, and just not great.   I found that the menu is just classics and they didn't try to improve on that. Very basic dishes, basic ingredients, basic plating, nothing innovative, no spectacular flavours, a little boring.  I expected to be wowed. But wasn't. So much so that I didn't even order any desert which is the first thing I look at.  Even the desert menu read outdated.  Whyyyy?"}
{"text":"Large portions, overpriced, and chairs are uncomfortable. It is nice for two people but if you are with kids, or a group of 4 or more. Then, there are much better places. The food is ok but you can do better"}
{"text":"I heard a lot and read a lot of good reviews about this place. Decor beautiful. Staff attentive. Food - awful.  My salad was so tiny and tasteless. My steak was burnt when I chose 'charred' , the side of fries were cold and soggy and the desserts - the blondie tasted like store bought chocolate chip cookies warmed up in the oven and the brownie was similar to starbucks. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in for a romantic dinner as out of town visitors.  Plus side, service was top notch.  Ordered lobster bisque for both of us. First sip, ugh....burnt bitter taste, also had a beefy flavor, not what you want in lobster bisque. Neither of us are it.  Manager came by and inquired, and ultimately they took both off the bill....an extra star for that. Entree was good, prepared properly, the complimentary starter of salmon tartare was very good, the bread was good.  But funny how a bad taste to start just left us feeling....bad. Could not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, with a pleasant, simple and understated decor.   Lobster bisque, chopped salad, bone-in sirloin, and maple glazed salmon were all great.   The sirloin was cooked perfectly to order, and the various sides we ordered were all very nicely prepared and served family-style (roasted beets, steamed asparagus, mashed potatoes).    Service was excellent:  the server was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, and the busers cleared between courses promptly.  Service was formal, but not stiff/uptight.  Overall an excellent meal, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, transient crowd, well-stocked top shelf bar and a menu that makes you thin awhile.  There are so many choices at this 'sister' restaurant concept owned by The Keg that a group of diners will all find something to their liking.  Up the ladder price wise from The Keg but not by much.  This is no beer bar!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely place.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on Dec.5 and picked it from the selection found in the Royal York in-room magazine.  We were impressed right away, the decor is elegant, the staff warm and friendly. We had dinner in the \"extended dining room\" after we were seated in the lounge but found the seating a bit uncomfortable for dining (great for drinking, relaxing, socializing tho) and they moved us quite cheerfully. Our server (Michael) was just fantastic - just the right amount of attention without being intrusive and we never felt ignored.  He was open, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and choices of wine/beer.  We like to order different dishes and share them, and when we mentioned this, Michael went out of his way to have it prepared and served to make that easy (the Filet came sliced English style, the starter salad served on two plates) and brought extra plates so that we could easily share both entrees.  All done with a smile.  The food was really delicious, and not over-seasoned.  I highly recommend this venue - can't say a bad thing about it."}
{"text":"Given its proximity to the Ritz Charlton and its association with it I had high expectations.  For the most part I was very pleased.   Decore: The Shore Club is decorated in a dark modern style that many steakhouses today mimic. Nothing special or unique, but well put together.  Service: The service was just right. Polite, courteous and timely without being too doding.   Food: possibly the freshest tasting crab cakes I have had in this city. They tasted as if they were made to order. The steak, sides and deserts were on par with what one would expect from such an establishment.  Beverages: A healthy selection of wines and spirits along with a interesting assortment of traditional and modern mixologist style cocktails.  The price: 3 courses + drinks worked out to between $100-150/person but was well worth it.  Where it feel apart: If your going to have a dress code, Eenforce it! Nothing takes away from a great dining experience like being smartly dressed and having two people in football jerseys sat next to you. Or to walk to your table only to spot a few people wearing baseball caps. Its an automatic deduction to what I feel I should be spending and knocked a full star off this review.  Would I go back. Yes. Will I continue to for my more expensive and/or special outings should those visits result in the same complaint: no."}
{"text":"One of the most solid and dependable options for an upscale lunch in the downtown core.  I've been there at least a half dozen times and I'm a fan of several items on the menu, but the lobster Cobb and the steak tartare stand out to me.   My favourite thing about the place is the atmosphere and the warmth of the decor. A terrific place to go on a winter day.  Also nice that the tables are not quite as jammed in as they are at so many other restaurants."}
{"text":"Shore Club is a great place to go for a date or for drinks with your colleagues. It's very fancy and it isn't cheap but the bar area is almost completely separate from the dining area, which was nice. Their happy hour is great with $1 oysters, $2 prawns and beer/wine special. Do not expect large oysters though, very small, but for a dollar at a fancy restaurant, who cares?? Try their happy hour before going there for dinner with your significant other. Great vibe and great service, but dinner can and will get expensive."}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to share this happy hour gem, but it looks like word is already out! Every day happy hour is $1 oysters, $2 giant prawns and $5 beer.   Tonight they had malpeque oysters for their buck a shuck. They serve them with lemon, a mignonette, fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce and you can get Tabasco and sriracha on the side.   The $5 beer was Muskoka's winter ale which was really tasty and a great deal for craft beer downtown.   We also ordered a charcuterie plate which had 3 different meats, pate, pickled veggies and amazing grilled bread.   This place fills up during happy hour, so get here early. It's pretty snazzy in here, so wear at least business casual or better otherwise you may feel and look out of place."}
{"text":"Walking into The Shore Club made us feel like we were walking right onto the set of Mad Men. With its high ceiling, exquisite wood furniture and waiters in white waist coasts, it certainly is a place with high standards set to impress. Breakfast at Tiffany's playing in the background on the TVs was icing on the cake.   We were offered the a la carte menu as well as Winterlicious but we wanted a little bit of everything so we decided to go with the Winterlicious menu.   To start, we ordered the Arugula Pear and Brie Salad with a champagne vinaigrette. Don't be alarmed if you don't see any brie on your salad, it's hidden under the arugula. The pear complemented the salad well with its soft yet slightly texture and the champagne vinaigrette was very light. The only thing that would have made it even better if it the brie was a big stronger as the flavour was a little faint.   The Smoked Cod Two Ways was prepared as a cod fritter and rillettes with crispy crostini. For those who don't know what rillette is, the preparation is very similar to a pate. On it's own, it was a bit salty but with the crostini it was perfect and balanced the saltiness.   The Grainy Mustard Rubbed New York Striploin with shallot jus came in a generous portion. I wasn't quite sure what sat on top of the steak at first glance, but it was caramelized bulb of onion.  As you could see in the picture, the steak was cooked as i asked - medium rare but the first few bites had a lot of fatty parts.  This must be a Winterlicious thing as I did hear before that The Shore Club offers excellent steak & seafood and is a Bay crowd favourite.  Fish seems to be a good go to choice for us whenever it's on the menu and the Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon with pea puree and candied bacon certainly did not disappoint . The simplistic presentation did not take away from the flavour of the salmon.  The fish tasted quite creamy and the pea puree added a nice touch of flavour to the dish while the candied bacon added some texture. Even the steamed broccoli was delicious, buttery without feeling too heavy and rich!   The Bread Pudding with blackberries and Vanilla Creme Anglaise was absolutely delicious. The bread pudding was warm and full of flavour but didn't taste too rich and there was more than likely a lot of cream that went into making it. The ratio of bread pudding, blackberry and cream was perfect in every bite.    The Key Lime Pie was very smooth but it was slightly acidic.  Taking a bite with the bit of whipped cream atop the cake made the acid balance out much better.  This definitely helped cleanse my palate after the meal.   The server was very attentive and provided excellent service. The food came out in a timely manner and we were never waiting too long between each course, which is a pet peeve for us.  The Shore Club is definitely on the pricier side and will be of those restaurants that we save for \"special occasions.\""}
{"text":"Been a big fan of The Shore Club for a while especially for their 5-7 special on weekdays when they have their special ($1 oysters and $2 prawns, $5 beer and $7 wine). Been there maybe 3-4 times at least and never had a bad experience. Excellent setting, decor and an excellent experience. The oysters are delicious and fresh. Also had the burger a few times and it is incredible. The calamari is a bit soggy (had it twice and both times was not that great) but generally it is a small issue that shouldn't detract from the great experience"}
{"text":"Exceptional value for their happy hour specials. As many have mentioned, it includes $5 beers, $7 wines, 1$ oysters and $2 prawns.   Came in on a Friday around 5:30pm. It was difficult to find a table in the lounge area as the place was packed with the after-work crowd. Staff initially seemed quite harried and distant. There was a lot of activity in the lounge and I didn't feel that service staff were particularly prompt or attentive.  The lounge area surprisingly quietened down by about 6pm and thereafter service improved quite markedly. Our server became much more relaxed and was very accommodating. A couple more friends joined, and she suggested moving us to a more spacious table nearby where we could spread out.  We ordered a dozen of the oysters which were briny with a melon-like finish. The prawns were plump and delicious. They were devoured quickly along with the accompanying cocktail sauce. The mussels and frites were also quite good.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks and the beer selection is strangely good. The place looks upscale since it's right next door to the Ritz-Carlton but the bartenders and drinks are quite down-to-earth and welcoming. Would need to return to try out their food, though."}
{"text":"I had The Shore Club bookmarked on Yelp for the longest time and finally paid them a visit this past weekend! They were offering a Winterlicious Menu, but there were just too many things I had to try on their normal dinner menu I wanted to try.   For the appetizer, we ordered the Trio Fish Tartar, which was served with biscuits with large holes in them so it was a bit difficult to scoop. My favorite of the three is definitely the salmon. The white fish was too sour for my liking and the tuna was a bit bland, though the boyfriend loved it.   My choice of steak was the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly to medium rare just as I requested and it stayed that way as I worked through the whole 12 oz. Thank goodness they didn't use a burning plate! The boyfriend equally enjoyed his bone-in rib-eye that was recommended by our pleasant server as the best seller.   We got a bit greedy with the sides. It started out with just the sauteed beets and mushrooms, but then we saw the table beside us order these humongous onion rings, and so we caved in and added that to our order. The beets were lightly sweet and a great side to go with my filet! The onion rings were also very fresh - the onion inside the batter was still crispy, that's what I call good quality!   I can't believe we still had room for dessert (this room must have been over 2000 calories). I had the coconut cream pie and the boyfriend had the banana split. Overall, we weren't too impressed with the desserts. My pie was basically 2/3 whipped cream and I would have preferred if the crust was crunchy instead of soggy. the banana split didn't come with any choice of ice cream except for vanilla and it was also topped off with whipped cream.   Service was surprisingly attentive since I saw our server attend to more than four tables in the area. My napkin was neatly folded on my seat when I came back from the restroom. My glass of water was always filled, I never had to wave anyone down to refill it.   I was certainly impressed by The Shore Club, however, I'd save dessert tummy for elsewhere because I'd say it's the only thing they need to improve on.   Tip: They don't validate parking tickets in the building, but they do offer valet parking for $15."}
{"text":"Fantastic buck-a-shuck special on weekdays from 4-7pm with $2 prawns, $5 beer and $7 wine makes this place very popular during the week. One big plus is that there is no limit on the number of oysters you can order (like some other places will do for buck-a-shuck) and I've never seen them run out.  The dinner service on the other hand is quite expensive with the food somewhere in the 3.5-4/5 range.  Service can also be spotty, especially in the bar area during the weekday specials.   Still, they win a solid 4/5 from me for the best buck-a-shuck special in the city."}
{"text":"Why this place isn't more popular I don't understand. I tried it for the first time a few weeks ago for Winterlicious and never even ended up ordering off that menu. The menu is big as are the portions and well worth the money spent. I don't remember what I had mainly because I was probably thinking about my next meal which is usually the case when I'm eating. But whatever it was, it has inspired me to return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food - this place checked all the boxes.  Came here for my fiance's birthday while on a trip up North and thankfully found this place for a nice splurge. We started out with the tuna tartare appetizer, which was delicious (I don't even really like tuna tartare much), followed by a decent-sized Caesar salad. For the entree, I got the maple salmon, which was very tender and slightly sweet - perfectly marinaded and probably the best thing I ate in Toronto that week. My fiance got the steak and scallops on special, which were both very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We split an order of maple bacon mashed potatoes, which I loved but she thought was a bit too sweet. When in Rome though...  Our server is really what put this dinner over the top though. He was friendly, down-to-earth and very attentive, without being overbearing. I wish I could remember his name, but 10/10 for service because of him.   It's pretty pricey, but definitely worth the visit if you're starting off (or finishing) a swanky night on the town."}
{"text":"We were for happy hour. I came here and sitting at the table waiting for my friend. But during the first 20 mins , no one came to say anything to me. No water, no menu, no anything. And finally, the waitress shows up. I feel like she is not friendly. She never smiles. And when I say Hi to her, she didn't reply me. Maybe because we only ordered the 1 buck oysters? After finishing the food and waiting for another 20 mins. I have to go to the front desk and tell the waitress that I want to pay my bill, because she didn't come to check us. I gave her 15% tips, but her service doesn't deserve it. And some of the oysters are VERY tiny. Won't come back again. There are many other buck a shuck oyster deals in town."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR ONLY!   I am so happy I found a new buck a shuck happy hour! Like any other fan of Big Daddy's happy, it was crushing when I was told they no longer have that HH menu.  Shore club has a huge lounge area and bar seating and the wait staff are amazing.  It's a super swanky place with big comfy chairs and tables.     I'be been here twice and it there was a bit of consistency loss.  The first time I was very impressed with the oysters but the second time around was average.  Out of the 30 oysters I ordered, there was one rotten and three that tasted like farts.  The manager did come by to apologize and asked me if I wanted anything, I had already ordered fries so she comped it for us.  At Big Daddys, when I had one bad oyster in the five years I went there.  I didn't realize what I had just ate but the server at BD saw and management comped us with four extra oysters off their HH, enough for the table to try.    All in all, I would highly recommend the shore club for their service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I went for a work meeting with the bosses here, and I think my experience was pretty good.  Food: I ordered the lobster club sandwich, probably one of the best I have had. Filled with lobster and avocado pieces and the sauce used was really good. I got the Caesar Salad and it was mediocre, especially with their prices. Overall It was good but for the price it should be bigger, and its not the most filling.  Price $ 24.00 for a small lobster club sandwich.   Service: Our server took his time to come in between, but he was attentive but tried pretty hard to upsell. At the beginning, I wanted buttermilk fried chicken, but apparently their machine is down, been broken for 2 weeks. I was told it will take about half an hour to make the chicken. Inconvenient for anybody that has an hour lunch.    Apparently on Halloween night 2016, a car crashed into the door from the side. ( The shore club is attached to the Ritz Carlton) and till now it has not been fixed, and you have to use the other door side. My boss was like if they have not fixed their door since Halloween then say goodbye to your Buttermilk Chicken.   Atmosphere: its nice and quite, and big enough.  Frequented mostly by the wolves of Bay street. The main door is hidden, so you might be lost at the beginning. Will I come here again? Yes. I'm curious to try their dinner menu, and if your looking for somewhere quite and special to take your significant other, its a good spot."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Seafood is fresh and everything taste delicious.  But the service is bad.  It takes too long to get another glass of wine and I have to hunt down our waitress to place any order.  Most importantly, watch out for bill scams - double check your bill and let them know if you've been charged for extra drinks.  I still gave them a mediocre 15% tip but they didn't deserve it."}
{"text":"This is a really classy and posh place, but to be completely honest, I came only for the dollar, buck a shuck oysters!  Our orders came very slow, painstakingly so. The oysters were served simple and with no frills; they were accompanied only by a simple red wine vinegar, horseradish, lemon wedge, and hot seafood sauce.   Compared to John and Son's, these oysters fell on the smaller side. That said, perhaps there is a correlation between size and flavour, because the flavour was so much more distilled and rich! The oysters were an explosion of flavour. It was sweeter - you could distinctly taste the pure sweetness with each bite - and the texture was firmer. The oysters were plumper, fatter, and creamier, but lacked some of the oyster liquor. Not sure if it was that the oysters weren't cleanly shucked, or if it was due to the freshness of the oysters, but they stuck to the shell slightly more. A great way to enjoy happy hour if you want to go to a fancier place!"}
{"text":"Food is good and service is excellent, but the unnaturally low chairs detract from the overall experience...."}
{"text":"Great spot for an after-work bite/drinks.  The beet salad was highly disappointing (anemic looking yellowy romaine with tiny cubes of beets) but the roasted tomato soup was delicious!  Some tasty looking items on the menu.  Will definitely go back to try a few more.  The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I went to The Shore Club and all I got was a free dessert.  Appetizer:   Shared: Jumbo Prawn Cocktail - 3 stars Me: Trio of Fish Tartar (chef choice)  - one was mixed with mayo??? 2nd mixed with blue cheese??!!! 3rd with soy & sesame oil. Him: Apple Cider Smoked Salmon - 3.5 stars  Main:  Me: Halibut with Macadamia nuts (waiter suggested medium so I said sure... It came out dry like jerky!!!) ZERO stars  Him: Salmon with Maple Glaze (waiter... How would u like your salmon? Medium? Great!.... It was over cooked with albumen (white protein buildup from over cooking). Ewe!!! 3 Stars  Waiter came by & we told him that the fish was over cooked. He offered to replace it but we declined.  The manager came by after and told us that we could have a dessert on the house.  Service: 3.5 stars"}

{"text":"I went here for my birthday and was so glad that I did. The service was top notch from the minute I walked into the door. The atmosphere was perfect - clean, classy, warm and inviting. The waiters/waitresses were extremely attentive and the food was absolutely delicious. Everything came out at once (something that is rare these days) and cooked to perfection. Our table ordered the risotto, bone in rib steak and filet with sides of mac and cheese lobster and scallop potatoes - I highly recommend the steaks - mouth watering and flavourful. They refilled our drinks regularly (this is a big one for me as many places do not) and made sure we were comfortable. A great surprise is the birthday truffles they brang out for me and my guest - along with a hand written birthday note - this added such an amazing touch that made me know for sure I chose the right place to celebrate my birthday. When leaving, my friends and I were amazed at our experience and already knew we wanted to return. Thank you Shore Club for such a great experience."}
{"text":"check another one off of our summerlicious list!. this place was fab, the ambience, the service and food."}
{"text":"My biggest issue with this place is the seating, you sink very deep into the chairs which is not ideal for a work lunch conversation, perhaps this venue is aimed more at the casual after work cocktail crowd? The food is about what it should be considering the price and the wine selection is fairly limited (geographically)."}
{"text":"This is a review for their oysters. We came at 6pm on a weekday for their buck-a-shuck. We ordered a dozen. Unfortunately, 6 out of the 12 were foul. Some you could tell from the smell.   Service was good, even though it was very busy. Ambiance was a bit formal, as in... older people in suits. Not that I mind, but just letting others know in case you were looking for something more casual."}
{"text":"The food and variety of choices was outstanding. Our particular server was a 4 out of 5 given the lack of wine knowledge and a few missteps, but it may have been due to being a slow Monday night that the server didn't bring her A game. I would repeat this choice restaurant in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"For me this place was great! It was a great spot where I spent the last night in Toronto eating dinner. Classy the service was great very nice ppl. The food came incredibly quick! The lobster tail was so fat and juicy and the steak was right on point! I would recommended it to anyone looking for a nice classy spot that doesn't hurt the pockets to bad (especially when you have usd) lol also the sides come family style so the amount that comes in you can share so GET A SIDE !"}
{"text":"Good food as how I remembered it. Mussels were excellent! Special lobster bisque were good but little bit too salty. Tried baked Alaska this time, very cool effects and refreshing sorbet! Nicely done.  Seats were not all comfortable as that's more for drink than dinner. Better than no seats."}
{"text":"While the Shore Club's ambiance was great, the food, in my opinion, came short. The fried oysters were soggy and unfresh and the boullabaisse was egregiously overcooked. The scallop and prawn ceviche was average at best. To top it all off, the meal came out to over $160."}
{"text":"I visited The Shore Club for their buck a shuck special after 10PM one Friday night. The restaurant/lounge was actually quite empty so seating was available right away. I was quite hungry so on top of ordering oysters, I also got their mussels & fries (starter) and a mac and cheese to share with my friend. The oysters themselves were decent and were accompanied by the usual condiments (i.e. lemon, cocktail sauce, mignonette, and horseradish). The mussels were a pleasant surprise and definitely worth the price - would actually come back just for this dish! Mac and cheese was pretty good too but the highlight here was definitely the seafood!"}
{"text":"Great staff and love their \"buck a shuck\" oyster deal. We went to a NOTL event with wine and snacks but missed our dinner, so this turned out to be a perfect find at 10pm. Although these oysters were east coast oysters (which tend to be smaller and grittier than west coast oysters), they were still very tasty and a terrific deal. No fancy sauces here, but simple was OK.  We also ordered the Mac and Cheese lobster side, which was very good. It was a bit on the heavy and salty side, but overall, delicious."}
{"text":"I was always afraid this place was a bit too swanky for a random afternoon drink and snack.  Ummm... Why did I not find this place sooner?  Happy hour runs from 4-7pm.  Weekdays for sure, dunno about weekends.  Oysters are a buck.  Prawns are two bucks. Sapporo is $5. Decent white and red wines for $7 a glass.  How is this place not jam-packed???  Irish Point from P.E.I. were smaller oysters but they were so fresh and so clean tasting.  We had over 3 dozen.  They came with cocktail sauce, mignonette, and some lemon wedges.  Of course, freshly grated horseradish too.    The prawns were large and firm.  Very good with the cocktail sauce, a dash of hot sauce, a sprinkling of horseradish, and a few drops of lemon.    I need to try their regular menu one of these days.  I'm just not sure I can get past the bar area with these amazing Happy Hour deals!!!   Service was excellent.  No snobbery here.    Who says you can only eat oysters in months with an \"R\"?  Nonsense."}
{"text":"Came here exclusively for their Friday night buck a shuck (4-7pm). Fancier a restaurant than I had expected and felt a little underdressed haha. We went with a group of 6 and had only ordered their oysters. They were on the smaller side but relatively fresh. Would definitely come back given it's probably the one restaurant offering buck a shuck on Friday evenings downtown Toronto and definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly overpriced for the quality that you get. I don't mind spending a little more for good food if it's worth it, and sadly this place was not. My cocktail was so overly sweet it tasted like pure simple syrup. I didn't drink it. The beet salad was just ok, and my husbands seafood chowder was so bland and tasteless it wasn't even worth dipping bread into (which was the only good thing we ate). My husband ordered the filet and he said it was tough and dry and overcooked and again - tasteless. No seasoning at all. For a $48 filet, you expect a MUCH better cut of meat. Side dishes were also quite bad. Scalloped potatoes - no flavor. Creamed corn - tasted like canned or frozen corn, definitely not fresh. We left a lot of food uneaten on the table and paid almost $200. Big waste of money."}
{"text":"I'm basing my review on happy hour experiences which I've attended twice. The happy hour special really is a great value for the money. I've indulged in the $7 wine glasses (choice of a white and a red), alongside the $1 oysters. They are fresh and come with your standard accompaniments (i.e. horseradish).  The first time I went, our server was fine. She wasn't overly friendly and seemed annoyed at times, even though we had a reasonably sized party. The second time I went, we had a much larger party and the server, Kirsty, was much more engaging and friendly. She adeptly balanced checking up on us amongst other tables.  Both times I've been seated in the lounge and it's quite comfortable. Having gone for the post-work happy hour, it's quiet enough to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal, fantastic service, fabulous cocktails. It was pricey, sure, but the food was a great surprise.  The calamari is likely the best we've ever had. So soft!   Steaks were great but the buttermilk fried chicken was an unexpected hit (:drool: there's gravy), and the sides were terrific.  We had 2 kids along - 10 and 12 - and they were treated very well. I would say it's not \"kid-friendly\" in the way that  a chain restaurant would be but our well-behaved young people were not unwelcome."}
{"text":"We came here for $1 oysters and $2 prawns after work. I can't say that I liked the oysters available the day I went at all. They were tiny, a bit grubby, with lots of grit. The prawns were so good though. Super meaty and chilled just right and oh, so good downed with a pint of $5 Sapporo. It was a good place to start off a Friday night."}
{"text":"After work this place has a pretty good happy hour for cheap beers and $1 oysters. I work in the area and frequent this place because it's close by for after work drinks. They used to have $5 pints of Sapporo but that's since been discontinued. I wouldn't recommend eating here because it is pricy for the quality of food they serve but if you're looking for a quick drink or small snack before heading to a game in the city, this is a good choice because it's nice and spacious in there. They still have decent drink specials Monday to Friday to check out as well."}
{"text":"Fancy place to wine and dine your special lady. Came here with a friend for their oyster and drink specials. Most amazing experience ever! Would defiantly come back for this. Service here is top knotch!!"}
{"text":"Too pricey for its own good and the food was mediocre at best. We sat in the lounge for a late night dinner. It was quite and comfortable. I ordered a plate of oysters which they claim were $1 each in the lounge for the late night menu, but on bill was charged $3 each... So beware!  For entree I ordered the stuffed trout. It was dry, bland and poorly presented. My friend claimed her braised short ribs were delucious, but I found them to be light on flavor. Lobster mac and cheese was pretty good, but then again how could that not be? The prices were very high for what you get and really all we got was some nice ambiance, which was probably because of the company I was keeping. This place might be good for drinks, but if your looking for good eats, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Shore Club has a great Happy Hour during the week from 4-7pm.  You can get $5 beer and $7 red/white wine (the specific wine on offer changes so you get to try a variety!).  The oysters  (only $1) and jumbo shrimp ($2) taste amazing!  They also recently added fries to the food menu.    It's a super classy place with a great atmosphere.  The staff are friendly and generally quite attentive.  Convenient place to grab a few drinks with friends after work.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Dinner was 10/17/2015.  Everything from the entrance, to the hostess and wait staff,  to the food was elegant. I looked around for reservations for an important celebration for the one I was with. I focused on the Shore CLub because the area was close to my hotel, the food looked good and the ambiance was right up my alley. The time there could not have gone any better. The hostess' at the door greeted my date and I  warmly and walked us to our table almost immediately. The timing of the service and food arrival was excellent. the Waitress, Ali introduced herself, let us settle in and returned after a short while. She took our drink orders after making recommendations and was back in a flash. I was able to order a dish (seared Scallops) that was not on the menu with no problems. Ali assisted me in selecting side dishes for the main courses we had, My date; the Lobster tail and NY striploin and myself the Ribeye steak. The meal was excellent, meat and seafood cooked to perfection.  The thing that makes this evening stand out is I had made a special request when booking the reservation and Ali was able to honor it with smooth attention to detail and without bringing attention to the arrangement so my guest was none the wiser. The meal was expensive but the experience, ambiance, service and meal were well worth it. Thanks Shore Club for making the evening a memorable one. When in Toronto again I will return.   Ali, your a rockstar!"}
{"text":"Nice spot, very quiet though Had great oysters here Lunch i dont rem but was a good portion size chicken sandwich! Out of the waya bit but worth a gander"}
{"text":"I was really very impressed with my experience here. The hostesses aren't very friendly or warm. Our server more than made up for their lack of energy or enthusiasm. She was one of the sweetest servers I have ever encountered. She was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all of our questions. She did an amazing job! :)  We were served complimentary, hot, fresh bread and I always appreciate when the bread basket is hot. My fellow diner was making a bit of a mess with breadcrumbs, and the server cleaned it up before the main meal was served. Talk about excellent service!   I had the Caesar salad to start, which was fine, but the burger was delicious, as it was juicy and tasty.   You can't go wrong with good food coupled with outstanding service in a chic restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with the bestie while in the city. The atmosphere was warm and inviting from the beginning, with the hostess and then the server. He was by far one of the nicest servers I've had in a while. His demeanor was very pleasant and he was very attentive. We ordered the delish beer salad to share as an app and he split into two plates for us. Next was wine, filet mignon and rainbow stuffed trout. The filet was perfect, the trout was not. It's stuffed with Dungeness crab and shrimp, but was so fishy/seawater tasting neither of us could stomach. The manager came by when she heard we did not like it and took it off our bill, AND also gave us a complimentary dessert! Above and beyond what we expected. They have a lot of variety in their menu, I would definitely come back again to try some other choices that I heard are amazing!"}
{"text":"Returned for the $1 happy hour oysters and stayed for dinner with a colleague. Had the wedge salad, tuna and key lime pie for desert. Service was good. Server was very knowledgeable on the wine list and quite attentive. Was not cheap but both of us enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"The rating went down today. As the server was not pleasant. I did not feel welcome. Hence, the rating went down. At first, I was going to bring my two other co-workers back for oysters and happy hour. After today, I don't think I will anymore."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but sadly the food didn't stand up to the prices. Flavor on the beef ribs was bland, the sea bass was undercooked and the risotto was gluey. Only upside was picking a good wine. Won't return here."}
{"text":"Headed to Shore Club for their weekly happy hour featuring wine, rail drinks, and buck a shuck, as well as $2 shrimp! This cool bar section of the restaurant is spacious and offers a modern, dim decor. Located next to the Ritz, be sure to bring your cool self in especially during TIFF.  We ordered a the Cave Springs Reisling, half a dozen oysters, and the shrimp. While the oysters were small and grainy, the shrimp was a pleaser. Service was quick, and friendly. Lynn our server took the time to offer suggestions for our next stop once she found out we were doing the bar hop scene.  Next time, dinner is our goal at this venue!"}
{"text":"I had a filet Mignon. I like my filet bleu. It was perfectly cooked.  I don't recommend the Banana Split. A bit disappointed. Not enough real melted chocolate to my taste. They should have the whip cream and the chocolate sauce on the side.  The music was a bit too techno for a fine dinner place.  The servers' jacket were just weird. We both thought they dressed like a Chef in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Understated is probably a good description for this place. It's great for a business-y lunch or a quiet dinner.  I've tried the lobster roll and the lobster cobb salad and I would recommend both. The pieces of lobster in both dishes are big! Not shredded like a lot of other restaurants. The salad is fresh and unlike some other cobb salads, the components of the salad are cut larger so you get large pieces of blue cheese, a sliced egg, avocado, bacon, etc. The lobster roll was also really good - I liked that they are light with the mayo so I could actually taste the lobster and avocado."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is high. The portions are small and prices are high if you are ordering from the dinner menu. For example 3 oyster Rock, bowl of lobster Bisque, and a piece of rainbow trout( that was a good portion) total $67.00 with no drinks. Happy hour looks like a better deal."}
{"text":"4 stars for the oysters...buck a shuck! A colleague of mines commented that the beef wellington was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Started off with the mussels - plenty to share and SO tasty. The chef also gave us each a tiny plate of salmon to try courtesy of the chef! For our mains we each got a steak. We ordered a plate of fries to share which sounds weird to pair with the steak but the waiter recommended the fries and he was right, they were really good. Our overall experience was really nice. It is definitely a higher scale restaurant but the staff does treat you well. I enjoyed my time there and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The Shore Club is beautiful. It's decorated with a dark, vintage feel with old movies playing on their TVs. This is a place of class and sophistication. It's where suited bankers and people over 40 come to talk about their trust funds. It's where my jean-cladded ass feels extremely out of place. Can't help it if my office is super casual and The Shore Club is the nearest source of buck a shuck oysters and happy hour alcohol.    Their happy hour deal is pretty legitimate. Monday to Friday from 4-7pm, no exceptions. You get $1 oysters, $2 prawns, $5 beer, and $7 wine. That's it, simple and easy to remember. Their oysters are on the smaller side but still good for $1. They come with the usual condiments. The beers and wines change frequently but the choices aren't bad. I think for awhile, their beer special was Sapporo. The only other non-happy hour food I've had were fries. Everything else is $20+ and I'm not down to pay that for an after-work snack.   Though I've shown up in jeans, and one time, god forbid, sweats, I've never felt discriminated against here. No matter if you're in a suit or look like a student, I've been provided great service by good-looking servers in a reasonable amount of time. The Shore Club is also technically connected by the Path, so you technically don't have to walk outside (technically, because the Path is horrendous and probably much better to walk above ground anyway).   Another specific mention has to be made for the bathrooms, which feel like they belong in a fancy hotel where they use towels instead of paper towels. If you want to feel high class without paying the high class price, go to The Shore Club for happy hour, take a trip to the loo, and leave feeling a little bit richer. Emotionally, of course, not physically.   (3/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"GOOD atmosphere, great vibe for bar/ dining/ happy hour delight.   I really only truly love it for the $1 happy hour oyster! What a fancy and nice place to come to after work to treat yourself to wine and $1 oysters! my fave!  However, I have been here for their winterlicious and summerlicious menu. I'm not a huge fan of it. I feel like its OK , but not amazing. the plating and the food was not overly impressive .. it was just MEh...   both times I ordered some sort of meat- either a steak or salmon.  Dessert was ok... but not memorable and definitely the side dish of veggies were overly salted. It was just a plate of salty green beans and not super impressed with the plating.  Not worthy of taking a picture of it .  BUT I WILL keep coming back for HAPPY HOUR oysters!!!! not for regular dining"}
{"text":"Very good meal, the scallops were wonderful, but was impressed with the mashed potatoes.  Overall was pleased for the price."}
{"text":"We were here for a birthday dinner last night. The reservation was for 7 people at 7:45 pm and on arrival our table wasn't ready. We headed to the bar for drinks first but it was empty and unmanned. We waited about 10 minutes when someone finally showed up we ordered drinks and it took awhile as the bar attendant was speaking with other staff. The table was then ready. Cocktails were brought over. Our server was friendly and told us about the daily specials and menu features. Our group had a good sampling of the menu. I had the crab cake for appetizer. I can't say it really stood out. Filling too processed and crab meat overly mushy. It's not lump meat crab cake. I continue to be on the search for an excellent crab cake in Toronto. Others had shrimp cocktail, fried calamari, lobster/seafood bisque. For main I had the steak and lobster. Was told this was New York cut. At medium the meat was not overly cooked and still red inside but it was not tender and fibrous. The lobster was the better of the duo, nice size at 8 oz but it did taste made from frozen. Butter on flame came out well before so that was appropriately set up. Others at my table ordered the feature lobster paparadelle, prime rib, 14 oz NY strip. For sides we shared wild mushrooms, spinach, tempura onion rings, roasted beets, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes. Everything tasted good but it was not stellar as I expected from a high level steak place. Overall steak experience didn't really stand out. It felt like an overpriced keg experience. For dessert Birthday person had the cheesecake which had some lemon cream on top. They did make a birthday dessert and a handwritten card was presented so thoughtful touch. I had them bring just vanilla ice cream with some berries. It's not gelato. Someone ordered the sorbet for dessert and i was told it was pretty standard. I would say desserts are not their thing. I'm not sure if this was an off night for them or if this is the state of affairs here now. I was here when it first opened likely more than 7-8 years ago and remember it was a great dining experience. I think it has not kept pace to it's original concept. Based on my recent experience there are other steak houses to try."}
{"text":"Shore Club is an excellent upscale special occasion seafood restaurant. The dining room is a modern version of the classic dark wood steakhouse decor. The menu is limited and primarily seafood, with the typical salad, soup, appetizers, and sides. Wine choices are adequate and high-priced, like the food. Service was very good. We had a soup, classic shrimp cocktail, blackened cod, and a side of onion rings. We also had the baked Alaska desert. Everything was good, but the onion rings were great. This could be a 5 star restaurant if the menu were expanded and the wine list included a few more California bottles, particularly Chardonnays."}
{"text":"I returned to the restaurant but was disappointed in the cooked seafood plate. My friend and I were thinking of trying the cold seafood platter and then the cooked seafood plate. The service was great in the lounge with very few patrons on a week night over the holidays.  We missed the happy hour specials before 7 pm but stayed long enough to enjoy the late night ones.   We ordered a bottle of white from Monterey which we enjoyed. It was reasonably priced compared to other options.  The seafood platter was great with crab, shrimp, oysters, scallop, and king crab. It was great with more premium items than other places buy the price reflected it.  Now on to the hot seafood plate. They had lobster,  scallop, other seafood, potatoes and asparagus.  However it was do disappointing compared to the platter that we had to let the waitress know. She was very nice enough to make us happy with some extra seafood.  I will go back but avoid the hot seafood plate next time."}
{"text":"Thank you The Shore Club!! I had a blast for my bday dinner. Staffs are attentive and food was amazing. Get the lobster tail, king crab and oysters!! Love the amazing service and ambiance. Would def visit again ;)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to celebrate our anniversary and her birthday here with some seafood. Right off the bat, the service was on point and was probably the best I had received so far. The servers and manager was very knowledgeable about the food they are serving people. I could tell that they hold pride in the food they serve and the service they provide. They made sure we were comfortable. And in the end, they put a candle on a dessert and the plate had happy birthday on it. They even went above and beyond by nulling the cake price because apparantely the piece size was too small. Its rare nowdays and should be complimented for."}
{"text":"I came here for the lounge special from 4-7pm:   Oysters  ~$1 comes with cocktail sauce, vinegar, horseradish.  You can order any quantity as long as they have it available.   Prawns ~$2 meaty and more filling if you were here to fulfill an appetite moreso than to socialize.   The staff were accommodating although it was quite busy.  On top of that i didn't expect for the interior of the place to be so upscale, and put together.   This is one of the most ideal places for dollar oysters since there is no set dozen you have to order, and the ambiance is super impressive; comfy and classy."}
{"text":"Went for a team dinner. Rating them this high because they dealt very politely with the chaos that ensued when 20 of us trickled in over happy hour.  The burger, is incredible.  Would I go back? Yup, only for that burger. This place is too pretentious for me otherwise."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is first class yet relaxed and warm...not stuffy. It was a lovely dining experience. We were seated promptly. Tables are spaced far enough apart that you are not on top of the people next to you. More importantly you can also speak with those at your table without yelling, and you can actually hear them too.  The waiter was a real professional. The menu is extensive and not packed with unusual items which many other restaurants have, seemingly just to try to be unique. Lots of choices including comfort food like southern fried chicken. They were out of a few menu items but none that interested our party so no problem for us. The food was served hot and everything was very tasty. Prices are up there so don't expect to get away cheap.  But the overall experience is worth the price."}
{"text":"NiI really liked this place. I'm giving it 5 stars because of both food and  service. To me, that's very important. My husband and I went there tonight and had oysters and the sea food tower they offer. The seafood was really good. Very fresh, but some of the oysters had grit, which means they weren't shucked properly, but it's not a deal breaker. It happens.  We had ordered a key lime pie and it was too strong for my pallete so I sent it back. The manager brought us complimentary drinks which I didn't expect at all. To me, that's outstanding service. I'm coming back for sure. Not just for the great food, but because the service us excellent. I love great service!! It's hard to find."}
{"text":"Having dined there previously and knew what their prices were like, I had high but reasonable expectations, which they failed to come close to.  On the positive side, decor and ambiance still were good.  The service was very disappointing. Not sure how much blame our server should take as he was very professional and provided excellent help in menu selections, however we received inconsistent attention and we're delivered a tuna tartar when we ordered a salmon tartar, without being told in advance the salmon was no longer available. Had we known earlier, we'd have ordered something different as one of our group had a tuna allergy.  The attention to ensuring everyone had drinks fell short. I personally ended up waiting over 20 minstrel for my first drink and twice we had to initiate getting wine. It could have been the restaurant was understaffed or poorly managed table assignment was the main issue.  The quality of the food also was inconsistent. Some dishes very good, others missing the mark. The macadamia encrusted halibut sounded great, but was a big disappointment. It wasn't fully encrusted, seemed more like topped. The halibut was overcooked and tasteless. Calamari was not very tender. The tuna entre was also disappointing.  I was never asked how my dishes were and didn't want to dampen the spirits of the group by calling attention to my disappointment, so to be fair I can't comment on how well they'd have handled disappointment.  Despite the fact that overall I still enjoyed my evening, I am offering this low rating because a fairly expensive restau rant shouldn't fall so short on either service or quality, never-ending both"}
{"text":"The decor is awesome and food was not bad with the exception of lobster bisque which was disappointing and too salty.  I had fried oyster as an appetizer and it was good, batter at the right consistency and thickness.  The filet mignon was a good size and was perfectly done.  Wine collection was not bad. The high of the evening was the dessert, apple cobbler came in a generous portion.  Warm content with a high scoop of vanilla ice cream covered thinly with caramel sauce.  Even though I was so full after the steak, I was able to finish the cobbler."}
{"text":"I came with a group and it was an enjoyable experience. I made a reservation a week ago and they said they'll call the day before to confirm the reservation... I didn't get a call but thankfully, the reservation was still set.   I loves that they had two waiters serving all 15 of us, most places usually have one, so I was extremely grateful for two. Also, our dishes all came out at the same time with help from other servers.   On the flavour of the dishes, they were delicious! We happen to come when they offered Winterlicious so was exciting to order more than an entrée. Many of us ordered the salmon as the main and mine was cooked perfectly. However, some found the salmon a bit under and sent it back--to each their own preference. As for the dessert... I got a taste of the butter tart, which was almost a battle to get a bite on the fork. The s'more pie was very rich and sweet, some contrast to balance that desert may have been better."}
{"text":"Always happy about Happy Hour. Some are better than others.  Shore Club's start at 4pm and ends at 7pm. Their best deal is the $1 oysters. They are very good quality. There is also $2 prawns but I did not order. Drinks are $6 draft beer on tap and $8 to $10 glasses of wine (not cheap).  Comes with no bread nor nuts or anything.  Service was \"meh\". Bartender was fine but the waitresses did not serve. Nobody asked how was the food etc.  Overall, the oysters may draw me back but that is about it."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there for Winterlicious dinner last night and both of us though it was okay but it wasn't as good as we expected.  We ordered the strip loin and whitefish for the main courses. For me the most disappointing thing was the steak got burnt a bit on the outside.... And I felt like the sauce of the whitefish was bit too strong (too acidic). But other than that, everything was good. I love the bread pudding, I would recommend that."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. Very nice and classy decor.   Unfortunately, the service was slow and we all felt a hint of attitude from the person who took care of our table and also from the person in charge of the wine.  The food was average and typical fine-dining portions. Our mains came late, close to 9:45pm. The flutes were taken away from us even though our bottle was not even finished. When we asked for separate bills, we were given only one and the whole thing had to be redone. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor and location. Superb service. But the food lets you down. Or maybe it's just my taste. Don't care much for the fusion style. I think the chef is trying too hard to make a distinct taste."}
{"text":"Nothing makes me more happy than happy hour specials!  buck a shuck, $2 prawns and $5 beers....what seriously can go wrong?!  The oysters are delicious, the service is great and the atmosphere is high end class.  So we low classed up the joint in our casual wear (we just came from a bar watching a soccer match) and no one looked at us sideways.  So yes they won't turn you away if you are too casually dressed, but I recommend cleaning up yourself a bit before coming.  Luckily our orders came out pretty fast - surprisingly it wasn't busy when we got there at around 5pm-ish so no long waits for us.  I definitely would come back.  Oysters, $1 deals?  Oh yeah...my heart is singing away"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for happy hour.  Their computers are set a few minutes slower so we ordered fries and a salad while we waited for it to be time for $1 Oysters.  The vinegar and salt fries were okay, I don't think they are worth $8 though. The beet salad I got was definitely not worth it. Iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes, a few pieces of beets, goat cheese, and ranch dressing for $12. Four words: Do not get it. It wasn't awful, it just wasn't very good. Definitely not worth the price, even with the skyrocketing prices of produce.  So when it was finally happy hour, my friend ordered 8 oysters and I ordered 5. They brought us 10, and 8. The waitress  pretended like she didn't know how many she was bringing out to us. Whatever, we said it was fine and took them. They weren't bad, but you can't really screw up oysters on a half shell.  So when the bill comes, the waitress said she took off some of the oysters because they made a mistake, but the bill very clearly said they charged us for 18 oysters. I dislike liars.  $50 for a mediocre salad, fries, and 18 oysters. Meh."}
{"text":"The Shore Club is upscale seafood and steakhouse with a comfy dining area and lively cocktail bar with a notable long wine list.  For drinks, we ordered the following: Peach Sangria, Iced Tea, Sauvignon Blanc, and Chardonnay. After placing our food order, our server brought out warm bread and butter for the table. Before our appetizers and entrees came out, our server gave us the amuse of the day, which was an Oyster Rockefeller. The Oyster Rockefeller consisted of a baked, warm oyster topped with spinach in a creamy bechamel sauce and parmesan.  The King Crab Cake consisted of a large patty of king crab meat and diced vegetables served with horseradish dill mayo. I felt that the crab cake had a lot of filler in it.   The Shore Club Seafood Tower consisted of a nice variety of fresh seafood including lobster tail, king crab legs, jumbo cocktail prawns, oysters, scallops and halibut ceviche, and pepper-crusted seared bigeye tuna. My favorites were jumbo cocktail prawns (served with cocktail sauce), oysters (served with mignonette), and the pepper crusted seared bigeye tuna (served with ponzu sauce).  The Atlantic Salmon consisted of an pan roasted and maple glazed Atlantic Salmon. I felt that the salmon was a bit well done.  Since the entree were al carte, we supplemented them with three vegetarian sides - Seasonal Vegetables ('brussel sprouts'), Fresh Asparagus, and Grilled Marinated Wild Mushrooms. My favorite was the Grilled Marinated Wild Mushrooms, which consisted of wild mushrooms cooked with lemon, butter, garlic, and fresh herbs."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. We came here for Summerlicious in a small group. The Summerlicious menu did not seam that appealing but I can't pick all the locations for my team :).  The selection I made was very tasty. I really liked the chilled soup. The location is very elegant, next to the Ritz Carlton.  The decor was modern and the wait staff were very prompt and synchronized."}
{"text":"What we had: happy hour (4-7pm weekdays) buck-a-shuck oysters  Taste: 10/10  The oysters were served with lemon, mignonette, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. I personally loved the mignonette and horseradish combo. The cocktail sauce overtakes the taste of everything else, but Steven liked horseradish and cocktail sauce combo. The oysters were fresh and savoury. We really enjoyed them!  Value: 8/10  The oysters on special that day were Malpeque oysters; size varies but is mostly on the smaller end but can't complain too much because they were only $1 each. We only went for the happy hour special as a snack so we didn't eat a meal there. The other menu items seemed to be quite pricey though. We ordered 30 oysters so after tax and tip it was around $38.  Service/Convenience: 10/10  The place is fairly easy to locate. When we went in on a Tuesday, it was not very busy inside. The place is fairly upscale and the staff are dressed up. However the waitresses are nice and down-to-earth and service is quick.  Would go back? For happy hour, yes. Maybe to try some other items on the menu but looking at the menu nothing really jumped out at me.  Would recommend to friend? Yes, for the happy hour deal.  Similar places: Pearl Diver (deals at Pearl Diver are a lot more restrictive though)"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday earlier this year.  It's sophisticated, romantic, and enchanting. Probably one of my all time favourite steakhouses in the city."}
{"text":"Food here was absolutely amazing! Their steaks were fantastic and cooked exactly as we wanted them. I love that they serve your sides on a separate dish than your steak so the flavours don't mix up. The servers are all really professional, well dressed, and super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Reviewing Happy hour only. Great location if in the financial area. Valet parking at the Ritz is only 15 bucks.  And you can pay with your bill, very convenient.  Parking under ground is 15 dollars, might as well valet.  Happy hour is 4-7.  Why I love it is they have a buck a shuck oysters, 2 dollar prawns, and 5 dollar Sapporo beers. Oysters are a bit small, but hey can't complain for a buck everyday.  The Prawns are delicious, and 5 dollar pints in the area...how can any one complain.  The lounge is not packed, very open and comfortable where you can sit back and talk. Music isn't loud, and chairs nice and cushiony.  The staff is extremely friendly, from the front hostesses who check your coats for you, and will call for your car to be brought up, servers who always make sure your beer is full, and also give you a heads up on last call for oysters at 6:55, to the managers walking and greeting everyone.  The service so far is great so i may try the dinner menu to sample something other than oysters and prawns"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch and my expectations from the food were low. The food was mediocre which is fine as you come here for the location and ambiance. The reason I've rated it low is that we had to wait over 40 minutes for our entrees AND the place was empty. If you are looking for a place for a quick lunch - look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"#winterlicious #theshoreclubca amazing food 1. Braised short rib 2. Pan seared Red Snapper 3. Key lime Pie 4. Sticky toffee pudding 5. Grilled romaine hearts  Great service!"}
{"text":"Great experience! My boyfriend and I just came back from here on a Wednesday night, after there specials, around 10:30pm, and they still had some sort of oyster special which was a great surprise since we came here spontaneously craving some oysters and drinks! First time here and fair to say that it won't be our last. We ordered a dozen of two different kinds of oysters, both tasty, with no shells - so key, and steak tartare, then later ordered the maple glazed salmon and the lamb chops with a side of asparagus to share and everything was supper tasty! My boyfriend is super picky and neither he or I had any complaints. Our waiter ( didn't get her name) was very sweet as well! Looking forward to our next date at The Shore Club!"}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown, a great central location to grab a drink and gather after work before a night about town. The bar space during happy hour (4-7pm) is first come first serve, but it is spacious with plenty of tables to accommodate the after work crowd. A beer is $5, oysters are $1 and giant prawns are $2 so the prices are reasonable. The environment and crowd is on the swanky classy side, so be at least business casual or you're gonna feel out of place. Will definitely back for a drink after another long day of work."}
{"text":"If someone uttered the words 'financial district' and 'happy hour' The Shore Club would never have crossed my mind. That is, until I attended a meet up event there a few weeks ago. For such a ritzy looking place the bar prices during this time are surprisingly decent.  What's The Deal? 4 - 7pm weekdays $7 wine, one red and one white $5 Sapporo $1 oysters and $2 prawns/shrimp  The bar area is really nice, there are tables, booths and bar stools and it is just the right amount of dark. The servers are very professional, it is full but not so full you cannot find a seat and has a happening vibe without being too loud. You definitely feel like you are leaving the hustle and bustle of the downtown when you step inside. The clientele are your typical Bay Streeters but probably not the same ones that frequent Earls on a Wednesday night.  Aside from the oyster/prawn deal you can also order from the bar menu. Unfortunately (for me) this is entirely seafood. I know, I know...it is a seafood and steak restaurant.  But it would be nice if they could throw in something generic like kettle chips or sweet potato fries.   The happy hour wines apparently change every month or so. At the moment the red is a perfectly adequate Côtes du Rhône. However I am disappointed the white - a moscato from Greece. Aside from the fact that I don't consider that serious enough wine to be the house, this one is quite dry, and everyone I've seen order it switches to red on the next round. It isn't actually on the regular wine menu so I guess that tells you how they feel about it. A pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc would probably be a better choice."}
{"text":"This place is vastly under-rated and under-visited, and this is from the perspective of an ex-SF food snob. The wife and I ordered 3 sides and 2 steaks. Everything was exceptional, including the wine recommendation (Fowler shiraz, a \"bargain\" in Canada at $75). The rib-eye (called bone-in rib steak here) was the best I've ever had, and I've had many. If you like steak and don't mind trimming some fat, you cannot go wrong with the rib steak. The filet mignon was 2\" thick and spot-on. The sides (scalloped potatoes, asparagus, and grilled beefsteak tomatoes) were fantastic and the perfect complement to the steaks.   For some reason, they have Black Forest cake. Not as good as the best ones we've had (in Germany), but far better than the average. If you are somehow still hungry after dinner and crave some chocolate with a little cherry, definitely worth a bother.   Ambiance was standard upscale steakhouse, which is to say classy and stylish with upbeat jazz/lounge music that even jazz-haters would enjoy. Strong reliance on indirect lighting, which I'm not sure why most other restaurants haven't figured out.   Service was some of the best we've had in a long while, which includes LA, Las Vegas, and Paris. They know how to work multiple staff per table. It was a pleasure to experience with Louis (our main server) at the helm.   While we didn't try any seafood, we will next time.   Please come here! It is a shame to see such a great restaurant as this not get the traffic it deserves. Plus, it is walking distance to the nightlife on King St W (extra bonus)."}
{"text":"Lunch - great service. Food was not great. Ordered fish and chips. Fish was dry and overcooked. Fries were OK. For the prices, I expected great quality"}
{"text":"Yum. This place is the perfect place for an elegant sit down dinner. I went to try out the happy hour in the bar, but it was too crowded when I got there, so I chose to just have a seat for dinner - a good choice. I had the caesar salad, prawns and scallops and risotto. The prawns and scallops were cooked to perfection. The caesar is served disassembled, so you have to chop it up yourself. I was skeptical at first, but enjoyed the experience. The risotto was a bit overcooked (the rice was more mushy than I'm accustomed to) but very rich and flavorful. I will return when I get the chance."}
{"text":"I went to The Shore Club for Winterlicious lunch this week.  It is very nice inside.  The hostesses at the door could use some warmth (as another reviewer noted) but our waiter made up for them.  He was fantastic and very attentive.  Our group ordered from the Winterlicous menu and it was good (but I was eyeing up the open face burger on the regular menu... I might have to come back for another visit just for that!).  Everyone in our group enjoyed their lunches.  Most had the pear & arugula salad to start, the salmon as the main and the bread pudding for dessert.  I also had the salad (very good) but then I veered off and had the veggie lasagna which was ok but not very filling and definitely not worth the price of Winterlicious.  To finish, I had the sorbet which was excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe its because we went a bit late, but the food wasn't that great.  The lobster is a bit foggy.   The steak is okay.  Nonetheless, it was a great dinner."}
{"text":"Great experience for a mid week get together. Hostess was incredibly inviting and warm, great bar staff and cocktailers. Took advantage of bar specials and lovely ambience. Staff are incredibly hospitable and the bar area is very lively. Would definitely come back again, servers lanna and a brunette with glasses (apologies for not remembering) were more than happy to run through the menu and let us know about what was a must try. Albience, service, and food all on point. What a great spot I never visited. They even put out an appetizer type bowl of nuts!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour! $1 oyster, $2 prawn, $5 Sapporo! Everything was so good. The prawn was a proper size; they were huge. The oysters were amazing. Sapporo wasn't available the night we were there, so they offered any beer on tap for the same price. Service was very friendly & attentive. Loved the ambiance, it was a nice mixed crowd. Great place to stop in for drinks... And be sure to order a dozen oysters, you'll finish them"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hour deals in downtown Toronto! Every Monday to Friday from 4pm-7pm they have lounge specials including $1 oysters, $2 prawns and $6 beers.  The prawns are quite large and very fresh. The oysters are a bit on the small side but for $1 it's still quite worth it.   The lounge is usually more crowded around 6pm so I would try to get there a bit earlier if possible. I've been there several times for happy hour and have always been able to find a table although you might have to wait around the bar for a few minutes. The crowd is the typical after work Bay Street type, a lot of people in suits which is expected given the area.   Service is a bit slow as it can get quite busy, it does take a very long time for our oysters to arrive so be sure to plan for the time. If you're in a rush, might be helpful to order the oyster and prawns right as you sit down."}
{"text":"Well, my friends, where to start on this place? Let's see if this approach works. First, I am allergic to shellfish, so oysters is out of the question for me. With that said, I went there only with the solely expectation to have a good steak and wine dinner. I don't have to mention (I give the place only 2 stars) I was completely disappointed from the very beginning. First, I asked for a glass of Malbec. I have nothing to say there. I never get disappointed with Malbec. I then ordered, a shrimp cocktail. Four pieces of Jumbo Shrimp well cooked (overcooked to my taste) with cocktail sauce, which was a little bit spicy. I will say, 3 out of 5 on this plate. Then I ordered a Filet Mignon (usually I take it medium, it came medium well, and it was almost closing time, so I just 'ate' it) with a side of roasted broccoli. Honestly my friends, I don't think that was the kind of steak I will expect from a place of this category. I will expect that kind of steak from The Keg not from this place (well... after a search on the internet, I discovered, The Shore Club is owned by The Keg, no wonder why the similarities). Considering the prices and ambience of this place, I will expect something better. I finished the beef and the broccoli (which was the best part of my meal, honestly), ordered a drink, finished it, paid and left. As you might guess right now, I left for good.  You might be wondering why did I give this place 2 stars if my experience was that bad. Well, the ambience is really nice and the service was good, that's the reason for the 2 stars. Anyway, guys, if you are in the mood for steaks, look around the neighborhood (or look my reviews), you'll find better options, almost at the same price range. Cheers."}
{"text":"Expensive!! From my usually budget, but it was worth the money. Oyster was really fresh. We shared seafood appetizer tower. The lobster tail, crab legs and seared tuna were all very good. For the main I ordered trout with crab stuffing, fish was marinated and no need to add anymore flavouring. Malbec 6oz glass was $14, oh well, once in a while is okay to splurge."}
{"text":"Came to The Shore Club for their 4-7 pm happy hour special. Their happy hour special is multi-day, runs through Monday to Friday. They serve $5 draught beers, $7 wines (they choose the selection), $1 oysters and $2 prawns.   The restaurant is super nice and cozy and reminds you of an upscale bar/restaurant you'll find in the 1920's. It has an old charm but still a modern feel to it. The waitresses were attentive and very nice. Ordered the $1 oysters special and their drink specials. Oysters were super fresh and they gave a variety of oysters from both the west coast and east coast.   Highly recommend this to people who are in the financial district and are down to grub on oysters after work!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here with a group for winterlicious lunch. Food and service were decent. Restaurant is spacious with comfortable seating and good privacy. However, at this price range, I might prefer other restaurant options in the financial district over this restaurant.  I ordered the Salmon Tartare for appetizer, it was delicious and the salmon portion was good enough to finish all the crostini on the plate. I had the mushroom risotto for my main, but the risotto is a bit stodgy, which made it really heavy. I think I would have enjoyed it more if they made it smoother, less stodgy, with more sauce. There's also not a lot of mushrooms in the risotto. For dessert, I got the sorbet which came in 3 flavours and was quite refreshing and wrapped up the meal nicely."}
{"text":"The 'small' charcuterie board was missing cheese, pickles or olives! My wife was sad . On a happier note, my old fashioned was a 9.5 out of 10. The Keg's old fashioned was a 7.5. My wife's attempt at replicating the burnt orange flavour was a 1.5, so let's just say I liked it. Prawns for 'Happy Hour' was a good deal. Buck a shuck oysters for happy hour were small, but well prepared. Nice time for hanging  out in the lounge (bar) before a show."}
{"text":"I love going to the shore club, the Service is fantastic, the waitress we had was super fun and had a great sense of humor, we ordered steak was cooked to perfection, they have a fantastic wine list also,  they run great specials and deals so it's always a good thing to check on what's the deal of the night, we ordered from the regular menu enjoyed both of our meals absolutely fantastic still doesn't hold the best steak in town but it's up there"}
{"text":"love it here. would be awesome if i could eat here more often for lunch since i work around the area.  love the atmosphere, the service and food! highly recommend if you're looking for something more   decor 5/5 - modern steakhouse style service 4/5 - polite, articulate, nth to complain food 4/5 - divine, can't go wrong with any order price 3.5/5 not bad, quality food"}
{"text":"Everything I ate here was delicious! Salmon tartare, prime striploin and seasoned vegetables and butter tart for dessert. Though the portions seem small compared to less expensive restaurants, the food is actually the perfect amount to keep you full and is well worth the money. The location is beautiful and the staff are great. They even wished my friend a great happy birthday with a dessert. Very happy with my choice to visit."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant located in between the Financial District and the Entertainment District. Came here with co-workers for lunch and our experience was great.  I ordered the Lobster Club. Took a while for our food to come but no complains - my club was filled with fresh lobster meat. The bread could have been better as it did not compliment the lobster much. It was dry, thick, and bland. At the end I just removed the bread and ate what was inside.  The atmosphere of this club is very classy and formal. You will expect people in suits and dresses.  I'm looking forward to be back to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had to date. This burger is very tender and goes down easy. The only complaint I have is the fries. They are horrible. But the burger makes up for it. I would advice getting a Caesar salad instead of fries as your side. Nonetheless this burger is a must have. It is called open face burger. The server we had was Louis. I have never experienced better service in my life. I have been I vegas, Caribbean, California, Toronto, you name it! So far, he was genuine, not pushy and it felt like you were treated as if you are royalty. Can't go wrong! If you can get Louis to serve you, you won't regret it! 2 thumbs up!  Another tip, you may request for them to add an egg to your burger. It becomes epic!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service every time! New surprises every time! Food and wine are delicious - best value for your price for high end dining restaurants. They have a comprehensive menu for meat and seafood lovers. I've been here for special occasions and birthdays. The staff always make the effort to really get to know you and your parties! Also have buck a shuck happy hours!"}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday celebration tonight and thought the  food was quite good .  I had a new york sirloin and thought the steak was very good but perhaps just a step below Mortons or Harbour 60.  The only complaint that i have is that the service was slow and our table for 7 was set up as 2 tables pushed together with the arm of the bench splitting up the table so that we were sitting far apart and it was difficult to talk.  The  restaurant is set up like a high end american steak house with modern decor and high end finishings.  I would recommend this restaurant as long as you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday to try out their happy hour offerings 5PM - 7PM: -$2 Prawns -$1 Oysters -$5 Sapporo  The prawns were amazing and you can't really go wrong with the oysters. The Shore Club is located between RBC Dexia and Ritz Carlton Hotel, which is very close to the financial district. The atmosphere is classy and you could expect to see people in suits there. Cheap drinks and oysters, not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing. Came to town for some customer meetings, and thus had a number of my team members with me.  As I usually do in a new town I went straight to Yelp to find good eats.  And lo and behold, The Shore Club appeared.  We made the quick walk over and were quickly seated.  Our server quickly came and took our drink orders.  There was a very nice selection from the bar to be had.    After a few minutes with the Menu, dinner selections were made and the \"event\" began.  The apps came out.  Delicious plates of awesomeness were delivered, Pork Belly and Oysters!  Dig in baby.  Next came the main course, I had the Rib Steak cooked to perfection, medium rare.  I even got a co-worker to try a bite, even though he normally orders his steak cooked to Charcoal Briquette!  He said he could hardly believe how good the flavor and texture were!  My job was done!    We finished up the meal and conversation and paid the bill.  All were extremely happy to have eaten in this establishment.  Roggen....out!"}
{"text":"The place itself is a bit outdated.  Needs a touch up.  Very simple but simple is sometimes better I guess.  I didn't know what to expect but the service was Wonderful!!! Our waitress was very helpful and sweet.    I was not a fan of crab cakes and have tried them in various places but that day, I fell in love!  Best crab cakes I ever had.  We were told it wasn't sharing portions but the size of these crab cakes were pretty big.  You can share it if you want.  We certainly could have just had 1 since we had steak and sides coming.   Now on to the steak...I had a filet mignon and WOW!!! Perfectly cooked!  I like mine medium and a bit of pink.  I have to say, it was exactly how I asked.    The wine was great, the vodka sodas we ordered after were perfectly made too...Overall, I will definitely be dining at Shore Club again."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, great ambiance. I had the clam chowder and my husband had a Caesar salad for appetizers, which were both excellent. The bread was served warm and was absolutely delicious. For the main course  I had swordfish with a side of onion rings. Those two things together tasted so great. My husband had the fillet which came with a generous portion of mashed potatoes, mushrooms and asparagus in a red pepper shell. the steak was cooked perfectly and was also very good. For dessert we had the key lime pie and creme brûlée. The Carmelized topping was a little thick on the creme brûlée, but otherwise, both desserts were quite good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"More so 3.5 stars. Overall, pleasantly surprised by the food at The Shore Club. I have frequented this place for their oyster happy hours but never really tried their food until recently.   Everything we ordered from the mussels as an app, the rack of lamb, and stuffed trout were all good. Prices were on the higher end (probably around $70 a person excluding drinks) but not surprising given its location beside the Ritz.  The ambiance was more professional than I'd preferred for a dining experience and felt a bit corporate. The service was great and very accommodating for our chaotic group of 10.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience and really have nothing negative to say. However, I think this place is more suitable for business dinners for visitors / hotel guests and wouldn't be somewhere that I'd recommend as a go to spot.   HAPPY HOUR:  Shore Club offers dollar oysters and $2 prawns with drink specials every weekday from 4-7pm which is definitely the most flexible out of all the oyster specials around Toronto. Despite the oysters being on the small end, it's a good place to grab after work drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Boy, I was impressed with nice interior but I wasn't too impressed with the service.  Upon entering the restaurant, there was a hostess who wasn't very friendly. She didn't bother to ask if we had a reservation. She told us to just go in, and so we did and a waiter stopped us and told us to go back to the entrance and get the hostess to grab a table for us. She was like \"oh sorry I didn't know you had a reservation.\" She must have thought we were there just for drinks, but given the distance from the reception to the dining area, it was no brainer there should have been someone leading us to the dining room and bar area. I haven't experienced this kind of thing anywhere else.   Once seated, our waiter went over the menu and he forgot some ingredients in a dish so he had to refer to his notes, lol. I got a special fish entrée that he mentioned. You get a little bit of everything: salmon, a couple of shrimps, three mussels, and scallop on top of risotto. I loved salmon, shrimps and risotto. They were delicious though you may find it salty. Mussels were okay. They were all dry. This entrée was not on the menu and it was a little overpriced ($44) for what I got. It was more like a 30-something dish. My dining partner got Stuffed Rainbow Trout and I got to sample a little bit. It was okay: fried fish with baby shrimp and crab meat inside.  We got to try their Fresh Asparagus side, which was a lot of asparagus. We ordered it because we were told that their main dishes do not come with any sides, so you need to order them separately. We also ordered a Lobster Bisque soup. I wouldn't order it again. It was too salty and a waste of money. It tasted as if they had it sitting for the whole day. Not sure if it was even put in the microwave. Even the lobster bisque from Old Mill was better and I don't like Old Mill's hot dishes. When we ordered it, we wanted to be able to share it, and the waiter kindly offered that he would put it on two bowls for us. We didn't think that it meant that they would charge us for two cups of the soup. If they were gonna do that, not sure why the waiter failed to tell us. We did share a soup from a couple of fancy restaurants before, and they didn't charge us for two cups of the soup. Another first from this fine restaurant! (sarcasm intended). My dish containing salmon, shrimps and risotto was good but it was overall an unpleasant dining experience, and I wouldn't recommend this place.   Lastly, the women's washroom had some weird looking circular shaped black thing bulging out of the wall in one of the stalls. I was freaked out if someone put a camera in there or something. It was kind of dark to figure out what that was, and it was pointing at the wall."}
{"text":"My fiance made a reservation for Summerlicious. It was nice not to be in charge of that this year!  I could see why some reviewers characterize the decor as stuffy/old, but I found it on par for restaurants close to hotels. It's definitely old school, but I like that. We were seated in a very private, comfortable and frankly romantic booth. Though it was right by the kitchen door there was no disruptive kitchen noise leaking out to the dining area.  To start we got the Grilled Calamari and Short Rib Agnolotti. My fiance enjoyed his calamari, I got a little taste and the honey citrus vinaigrette was on point! While I thoroughly enjoyed my agnolotti, I couldn't help but notice that the filling varied from piece to piece. One had too much stilton, another barely any short rib and the third was exploding with meat.  For our entrees we both ordered the Grilled New York Striploin. The chimichurri was disappointing as there was barely any parsley and too much of the tart and off putting peppers. The striploin itself was phenomenal and cooked perfectly as ordered. Definitely order the Ratatouille as a side, it was divine. The Green Beans were...surprise, green beans.  For dessert we ordered the Terrine of Sorbet and Key Lime Pie. The Key Lime Pie was where it was at. Decadent, creamy, hints of lime, it had everything. The Terrine of Sorbet was the opposite. For the first (or maybe second) time in my life I had to return it and order the Chocolate Brownie. The Chocolate Brownie was nothing special. I should've ordered the Key Lime Pie!  All in all a great experience. Service was wonderful from beginning to end. The servers, waiters and bus boys were very professional and found perfect opportunities to do their tasks without being intrusive. I would reccomend this place for steaks and service!"}
{"text":"I randomly felt like having raw oysters and vino yesterday so my boyfriend and I went to try shore club for their happy hour. We were there for less than an hour for a dozen oysters, 4 prawns and a glass of white each before we felt the need to eat something hefty and saucy.   Everything was fairly standard. Service was good, and although the oysters were tiny, it was still enjoyable.   Ive never heard of viognier or loureiro for whites but my boyfriend and I both liked their viognier (smoother) more so than the loureiro.   I'm not inclined to come back for their dinner, but never say never!"}
{"text":"I always walk past this place and I read about the happy hour and oh boy I love it! Will be my new favourite happy hour place for sure and if you're a fan of oysters definitely drop by! The lounge is posh and quiet so it's a great spot to meet up and catch up. I like that i can hear what my friend is saying without all the noise other places would have."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and a unreasonably high pricepoint for what it is. Seafood quality isn't that great, tartares are marinated with a lot of dressing, making it difficult to taste the flavor and quality of the fish, which is probably poor."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and 1 more star for the ambiance. Came here for their after 10 pm menu which includes oysters for $1 and prawns for $2. I got the prawns which were big and juicy, and I liked their seafood dipping sauce which was slightly sweeter than most other places. They had a daily sommelier's choice of red or white wine for $8 or $10. I got a glass of Riesling which was pretty good. The fried calamari was also good, although I found it a bit too salty. The calamari-to-batter ratio was definitely one of the better ones out there though. The overall atmosphere is upscale with high ceilings and surprisingly quiet - it is the Ritz after all. The prices are quite reasonable given the quality of food and service here."}
{"text":"As chains go its a solid choice.  The classic take a business associate out for good quality, dependable service...steak and seafood joint.  Good ambiance and a nice white noise background made it a good spot to try...food was okay nothing to remarkable tho"}
{"text":"The complimentary bread came first and it was alright. Nothing special. To start we got the lobster bisque, which I'd say was too salty and came out barely warm. It's probably the first time that I've seen a fine dining restaurant serve food that wasn't hot enough. Pretty disappointing appetizer considering this is a seafood place.  For my main, I got the stuffed rainbow trout which was... okay. Again, I thought it was too salty and the taste didn't match the price tag. Portion size is small so do heed the advice of the waiter in getting a side with your main. We got asparagus for the side, which turned out to be quite tasty and pretty large.  My wife got the weekly feature.. some mixed grill of seafood with risotto, which was actually delicious and definitely the best dish of the night. I hope they offer it regularly. This dish was a 5/5.  The inside of this restaurant is nice, although I wouldn't say it's amongst the best in Toronto despite the price of the food here. The service wasn't great either. We walked in and the hostess seemed confused. She immediately pointed us to the bar area, and then a waiter pointed us back to the hostess who seemed shocked we had a reservation for dinner (she never asked us when we walked in). Some of the staff who arrived to serve the dinner plates seemed grumpy and cold.  With the hit and miss food I would've given this place a 3/5 but the end to the meal was unpleasant. When we ordered the lobster bisque, we had let the waiter know that we wanted one lobster bisque and that we were going to just share it. Normally, restaurants just bring you the appetizer as is or give you an extra plate/bowl to share it, and some restaurants with great service even split it for you. What this place did was give us two full bowls of soup. I initially thought they were just being generous because we said we hadn't been here before. What they ended up doing was charge us for two cups of lobster bisque, which we hadn't asked them to do nor were we ever informed until the bill arrived. So it ended up being $20 for lobster bisque that was supposed to cost $12. Very sneaky. We were in a hurry so we didn't bother to argue with the waiter.  They got their extra $8 but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Three of us went to dinner here and ended up ordering the same Lobster Mac & Cheese special plus a different salad for all of us. It was kind of humorous since the menu is not only extensive, also hosting some good meat selections, but at the same time very inviting -- as in everything was looking like a real option for dinner that night.  Service was wonderful and the Lobster Mac & Cheese was nothing like the title hints at. It was more like some wonderfully prepared lobster over pasta with Parmesan cheese. (See the photo I took)"}
{"text":"Cozy and slightly upscale atmosphere, came here to check out their happy hour specials as my friends and I were craving oysters.  You enter and seat yourself anywhere at the lounge located on your right hand side facing the bar to enjoy the happy hour specials, or, you can ask to be seated on the left side behind the bar area for a full dining experience.  Service was terribly slow (but friendly). Ordered 5 dozen buck a shuck oysters to split amongst 3 people and had their $5 draught beer pick of the day (which happened to be Sapporo).  Oysters were super small and not the greatest selection, you can find better quality buck a shuck specials elsewhere.   Lounge was quite packed a little after 6 in the middle of the week so I'd suggest getting here a little earlier to get a better table pick and ensure you get your order of oysters as they do sometimes run out before happy hour is over.  For a name like the Shore Club, I wasn't too impressed with the oysters, but of course, keep in mind they were only $1. Would probably come back again for their happy hour specials but I don't think I'd try their full menu anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came here after making reservations for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner. We were seated promptly at 7pm on a Friday night. Our server was a very nice man that made sure we got all the things we needed. I didn't see this on the menu online but they did have a seafood tower option per person and of course I had to have this to get a taste of everything. It came with pieces of lobster, crab, scallops, shrimp, and oysters. I was one happy girl! It was like secretly an early birthday present to myself. My mom's crab cake was very good too. We split the coconut cream pie and the key lime pie and that all was very delicious too. We were also a fan of the beets and the seasonal risotto. It was a solid spot, but once racked up it was a pretty American penny that I had to pony up."}
{"text":"How on earth have we not known about this restaurant??  Took my husband for his birthday and had a truly 5-star experience.  First of all, the decor is gorgeous.  Dark wood, rich blue velvet banquets, dim lighting...the perfect ambiance.  Our waiter, Monty, was superb.  He was very attentive without being overly accommodating. He knew it was my husband's birthday and kindly brought over Proseco on the house for us to celebrate with!  We began with a salad and shrimp cocktail.  Sounds mundane but honestly, very delicious.  We each had the same entree - sesame crusted tuna.  I requested so have mine plain and it was delicious.  We also ordered roast potatoes and beets as our sides and they were generous, yummy portions.  For dessert, Monty made the suggestion of a brownie sundae and it did not disappoint.  We really loved our experience at The Shore Club and cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great place and service. Had the mussels for appetizer, lobster bisque and trout stuffed with king carb meat. The mussels were amazingly cooked, fish was good and the soup was a bit too salty for my taste. Overall was a great place for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Quiet, elegant, and our waitress was very nice.  They were generous with the bread and butter and continued to ask if we wanted more. My partner, Mr. Karl R, never says no to such an inquiry. We had 3 plates of that, it was amazing.  We started with Fried Calamari, comes with cucumber yogurt dip. It was just \"Alright\" for Karl but quite good for me.The batter was soft and disappeared in my mouth.  Karl ordered the Red Snapper, grilled, with some olives topping. I thought the olives were so strong and covered up the fish taste. But the fish was still very tender and was only lightly grilled. I liked it.  I had the Sauteed Prawns and Scallops, poached in milk, with lemon beurre blanc. That was very very very good. There were about three large scallops and 5-6 prawns. The sauce was so amazing, I dipped our Salt & Vinegar Shoestring Fries in it. The fries were yummy!  Overall, the food was very good. Loved the bread and butter. Service was good. There is also no wait staff..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food. The filet was cooked how I like it and the sides that we had (mashed potatoes, green beans and macaroni and cheese) were delicious. The creme brûlée was also delicious. My boyfriend thought that his meal of oysters, scallops and shrimp was okay. He said the scallops and shrimp didn't have a lot of taste. Overall, I enjoyed the experience. Great atmosphere and great service as well."}
{"text":"Shore Club is an underrated restaurant within Toronto. I don't know why people had such bad experiences at this place but I've been here twice and have been treated well both times.   I think Shore Club started on the West coast and moved over but looking online, I see that there's only one in Toronto and Ottawa now. The Toronto restaurant has a very upscale and modern design. Entering into the lounge area and dining room, you do understand why it is next to the Ritz. The place does look its part. My friend jokingly told me that you had to wear a blazer to dine at the Shore Club and I believed him without thinking twice (I don't think that actually is the case)...  Anyhow, a group of us came for lunch once. The menu is heavy on seafood which worked well for our group. Their lobster salad looked good and their lobster roll that I ordered definitely was good. If you look through their menus, you'll see that their prices for lunch really aren't that bad either. Maybe we should keep that to ourselves so that they don't start raising their prices to what they actually can charge at this place..."}
