{"text":"Awesome prepared pastas and lasagnas."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but the service is so horrible I will NEVER GO BACK. And I love food so that means something since her sauce is homemade. The owner said terrible things to a friend of mine once, she overcharged me and took my money and refused to give it back because she thought I hadn't paid her. I wish I had the thought to leave without buying anything. The idiot that I was...I quietly paid and never went back. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"Hi, I read the last review - My experience has been the opposite on all counts! I love all the dishes I have tried which is most of them!! And I have always had courteous enough service! I hear university students stock their freezers with all the meals and besides the dishes and sauces containing delicious, tender meat, they have many vegetarian ones too! cash or cheques accepted"}
{"text":"The pesto lasagna is one of the best things I have ever eaten. It's easy to overdo it with ricotta when it comes to lasagna, but this lasagna oozes gooey cheese from every possible direction. I'm not sure you could find anything better - it's become a staple at family functions."}
{"text":"Bologna Pastificio is an amazingly simple place: there's a lady who makes amazing pasta and lasagna.  I've had her lasagna twice for parties at my house and it has been raved about, even by people who aren't that into lasagna.  My friend noted she buys the pasta and it's also awesome.  Two tips - bring cash and the shop closes early on Saturdays sometimes."}
{"text":"Yeah, the fresh pasta is better than Ziggy's at the grocery store but it's still too thick and obviously die-cut.  And, agreed, the lasagna is a step up from the mangacake madness that is the Tre Mari hot table, but it's still too thick and much too heavy on the mozzarella.  Se sei italiano? Non speciale.  When the best thing is the soup broth, it's really not worth the premium."}
