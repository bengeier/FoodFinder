{"text":"Delicious tacos and some good hot sauce to compliment them. Not bad on the pricing for the amount either. I'd stop there again when in the area and try a torta."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this! I went there to try the chorizo burrito only to be told they didn't have the chorizo made yet. Fair enough so I decided to go with the steak burrito as a second choice. It was good the pico was good cilantro was fresh. Steak however was tough and grisely and I found it not to be seasoned at all. Bummer. I will probably try again since everybody should get another chance. I hope next time they have the chorizo. Till then I can say it's just ok."}
{"text":"No longer the best. Changed ownership a year or two ago, and not the same preparation or ingredients. Not super terrible, just not special anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I haven't ordered in a while since I no longer live in Champaign but I thought I'd leave the review anyways.   I've tried the veggie burrito and it was absolutely amazing. I love how the food comes with the complementary dipping sauces (all which are extremely high quality unlike some of those of other Mexican places on green street). The food itself was clearly freshly made and not just slapped with the \"fresh\" label.   The delivery has always been on time and the individual delivering has been courteous enough to ring the buzzer and come upstairs and drop the food off and not call me and expect me to come down.  All in all, I'm very impressed. This place is as good as Maize (actually probably better) and also delivers. If I didn't live so far away from the actual food truck itself, i'd be going there quite often."}
{"text":"I give the food 5 stars but the 1 hr delivery is a bit much.  Eaten here several times...chicken tacos are delicious madness.....chorizo is good too, tamale are great as is the Dips...."}
{"text":"Ahh I love this place... I need to try the tortas and elotes still. But they have really great asada tacos and their salsa is good quality too. Friendly guy works there, we had a good chat about Mexico."}
{"text":"I'm so happy there is a taco truck in town! I eat here a lot. I've personally had the tacos, burrito, torta, and elote. All are very good. As for meat options, I've tried the steak and the chicken (only two I can eat out of the usual selection). Both are good, but the chicken is something special. I'm not sure how they prepare it, but it has great flavor. You must get the salsa, both kinds. Like the restaurant run by the same folks (Mas Amigos), the salsa is utterly fantastic and makes the dish."}
{"text":"EDIT:   Really really disappointed in my order today. I had a 5 star review before but today kind of ruined it. 1) I am okay waiting an hour for my order if it is good & what I ordered, but today it was not, which makes the wait disappointing. 2) I ordered cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce on my taco. Got sour cream and lettuce....which I can not eat and threw away. 3) I ordered cheese nachos, paid $4.28. I got 4 pieces of tortilla chips, which were hard and crusty slices of cheese.   Really disappointed because I just recently ordered from them for the first time and was ecstatic about how good it was ! Ordered 4 times in 2 weeks after that. Don't get me wrong, I think their food is amazing, and the elotes are definitely worth it. But I was really disappointed today :(   EDIT:: Just ordered for the first time today. Ordered the 3 taco meal (steak tacos, rice, beans); came with chips and salsa, elote and horchata. Everything tasted amazing, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food. 10x better than Miaz and Burrito King. Check this place out ! Did have to wait an hour to receive my food, which is kind of iffy, but it ended up being worth it !"}
{"text":"Real good food!  Burito could be a bit larger(1 star alone) taco de pollo, yum!  They ask if you want it American or Mexican style.  Onions and cilantro being the added goodies on the Mexican style. Mexican style all the way.  What would American style come with, corn syrup, guns and xenophobia? Hah!  The verde salsa is a must, at least with chicken tacos.  Good to see a food truck in champaign.  Support it."}
{"text":"These guys rock out loud. Hands down best place for street Tacos!"}
{"text":"Tried the tamales, they are awesome. Not quite as good as homemade, but they beat El Toro by a long shot. I'm sad I only ordered one.   Delivery times are not great. I once waited over an hour for it to get to me. I don't think it is unacceptable though, as they only have one driver and deliver to all of Champaign and Urbana. Overall, picking it up is so much faster but either way I think it is worth it. I've never gotten cold food or a messed up order."}
{"text":"For the value and the taste, this place can't be beat! My burrito was HUGE and delicious. It cost $6 with everything in it, and lasted me for lunch AND dinner. Also, their green and red salsas are homemade and especially tasty. I want to go back right now! Please note they have new picnic table seating, and the Hawaiian Ice place is right next door for dessert."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ordered delivery from a food truck, and I must say, I was very impressed.  There are two hooks that will bring me into a Mexican restaurant; a good mole and a good elote.  This central Illinois gem had the latter on their delivery menu, so it really didn't matter what else was offered.  I ordered a carne burrito and the  tacoritos app as well.  The elote was very simple and perfectly balanced.  Crema, cotija, chili, and I believe tajin, which cut through the sweetness of the corn and fattiness of the crema really well.  I will return for this alone.  The tacoritos are miniature, deep-fried, seasoned beef burritos with a white queso dipping sauce.  They were tasty and quite filling.  I knocked down 2/4 and was completely full.  For posterity's sake, I took a bite of the two pound burrito and found it (unsurprisingly) delicious, but that's about as far as I could go without exploding.    All in all, this motorized taco is worth every bit of a five star rating, but I will consider shrinking my order so there is a chance in finishing my meal.  I should have brought a friend:)  Go here.  Give them your money.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Taco Motorizado is my favorite Mexican place in Champaign/Urbana. The food takes a little longer than is typical for a food truck but not much longer. The food is satisfying and the burritos are very large. The reason I rated them under five stars is because of their parking. There's usually people parked behind the truck who yell things at people going to the truck, which can be hard to quell but it doesn't seem as though they care."}
{"text":"I had the burrito from here and it was great. Not overpriced and it was cooked well. Go here instead of taco bell!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in town. Blows chipotle out of the water. Great price. Get the jumbo burrito if you are man enough."}
{"text":"The food was great! The guacamole was okay.... Had way to many onions in it which overpowered the great flavor of the avocado. Also I had the steak Super Burrito that was so amazing. Ingredients were fresh and it was very filling. Would recommend anyone who hasn't tried this place to stop by!!"}
{"text":"They get a good review because the food had always been good but today I ordered the veggie quesadilla lunch special. I got back to work and it was a yellow cheese  quesadilla. I assumed they messed up and gave me the wrong oder but they informed me that the veggie quesadilla just has cheese, it is called veggie because there is no meat . The offered to make a quesadilla with veggies since I was confused on what I ordered and I am thankful that they resolved the issue. Just a fair warning for any other vegetarian that orders from here. I recommend the veggie torta or burrito."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Very good service. Tamales are to die for.  They packed it up so nice to be carried out so it wouldn't leak."}
{"text":"I wish I would have eaten here sooner!  I only recently discovered this little gem and had to go back within 48 hours to get another fix.  The food is amazing.  During my first trip, I had a chorizo taco Mexico style (cilantro & onions) and a chorizo quesadilla.  Holy chorizo, Batman!  It was so good and such a huge serving.  The taco was ah-freakin-mazing.  I love that you can order Mexico style with cilantro and onion or American style with lettuce and tomatoes.  The quesadillas are overstuffed and toasted perfectly.  One quesadilla could definitely feed two, especially if you throw 1 or 2 tacos in the mix.  I've also tried the steak taco, American style and the chicken quesadilla.  The food is so fresh tasting and the meat tastes like real, high quality product.   Another huge perk... The workers!  They are so friendly.  During our first visit, we were given some homemade pickled jalapenos to try.  They were amazing.  They aren't on the menu, so I'm not sure what to ask for next time I want them!    You have to try this place!  It's cash only and they will wrap your food to go if you prefer to not eat at the picnic table."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight, everything was great! Veggie torta, veggie tamal, chicken fajitas and elote, we love it all, a lot of flavor and very tasty! Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chorizo super burrito and a Chorizo soft taco for delivery.  The soft taco was delicious.  The Chorizo in the burrito was singed and had a burnt smoky flavor to it.  Overdone."}
{"text":"I've driven past this truck many times and wondered if anyone actually eats there. I searched Mexican food in yelp and it popped up. I read the reviews, which were all good, so I ordered the chips and salsa, elote (corn on the cob with cheese and chili powder) and mini chimichangas.  Everything was so good. It's just as good as Maize but cheaper and you don't have to wait in long lines. They deliver too. I will definitely eat here again! Best authentic Mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious and definitely authentic. One bite of these savory tacos took me back to my honeymoon in Mexico. I cannot speak of the burritos or the quesadillas because I've never had them. I stick to my tacos. I've tried all their tacos. My favorite are the steak and chicken tacos with a side of guacamole & chips.  For Maize fans: This spot has better sauces, and is more affordable. If you want the maize taste just ask them to add cheese. You end up eating just as good if not better for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I crave Mexican food often & am a seasoned food truck stalker so this was the perfect opportunity of passion & skill. Upon seeing the rave reviews & a Yelp coupon, we set out on bike to work up an appetite. We found the truck in a mini lot with a very wobbly picnic table on the cusp of a busy street. Our pre-order was waiting: The chorizo nachos ($7.25) was small & consisted of some deep fried tortillas that weren't all that crisp. It was topped with chorizo & cheese. The beef & chorizo torta ($7) was filled with meat, avocado, onions, a few green things. It was well-balanced & tasty. The tacos ($2) were done up Mexican style (i.e., onions & cilantro) with pastor in warmed corn tortillas. It all comes with several salsas. I get tamales about everywhere I can. So naturally, one appeared in our order. The chicken tamale ($2.50) was tiny & came with cheese sauce. Overall, it was ok. I'd possibly get the tacos & tortas again. And beware of the wobbly table!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I love this place! Reasonable price,  a wide variety of menu, and delicious food!!! I ordered  regular chicken burrito, guacamole and eloté. They were all excellent."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, it is a shame that only 26 people have written reviews before me.  This place is amazing! Best tacos I have had in a long time.  I hope they open up a restaurant soon but if they don't I'm perfectly fine ordering from their truck!"}
{"text":"1st visit:  Awesome food for very reasonable prices and when I went, the customer service was great. The guy in the truck was friendly and helped recommend some options.   I ended up ordering a burrito and 2 tacos. My burrito was al pastor and the sauce was slightly sweet, which I found refreshing. They also included fajita vegetables in the burrito, which was a great compliment to the other ingredients. The burrito itself was not especially large but the quality made up for it.   My chicken taco was good but the real winner was the steak taco. The steak was absolutely mouthwatering, tender and juicy, probably the best taco steak I've had in CU. Next time, I'm going for a steak torta/burrito.   2nd visit:  I did order a giant steak burrito and although it was quite large, the steak was dry and chewy this time. Total opposite of how it tasted last visit. Brings down the stars from 5 to 4.   I also tried the ground beef and chorizo tacos. The ground beef was fine but the chorizo was really excellent. Nice subtle spice and great flavor."}
{"text":"Got delivery, and it was awful. Ordered a veggie burrito, which came without the peppers and onions, just soggy mushrooms. The side of guac was mostly tomatoes and onion, with very little actual avocado. My bottled Diet Coke was room temperature and somehow flat. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  I had the tacoritos, and he told me initially about an 8 minute wait.  It was about twice that, but it was worth it.  Yummy!  Most of the folks stopping by were getting tacos, and I'll be trying it again, and will try those.  Apparently, a pretty popular stop. Right next door to an authentic mexican store, so if you want something like Mexican Coke or Pepsi, or baking ingredients, etc. it's right there!"}
{"text":"There are tons of Mexican eateries in the CU area but most of them have not lived up to the hype. I recently moved to the area from Miami so I've had my fair share of Hispanic food in local restaurants and in my own home. Taco Motorizado has blown me away every time. Seasoning is on point, ingredients are on point. Their queso fundido Is amazing. It is actually melted cheese! (Unlike that glorified nacho cheese other restaurants love to label as \"queso.\") And their tacos are very good, simple, and straight to the point. Let me put it this way: if your taco is served with a side of lettuce strips and tomatoes, they aren't Mexican tacos. This is the only place in CU that I've tried that serves tacos the way they were meant to be served."}
{"text":"Finally, great Mexican delivery in Urbana! We ordered beef nachos and a chorizo burrito, standard take out Mexican fare. The food was delicious, and much better than comparable delivery joints in the neighborhood. Everything was hot, and the vegetable toppings were fresh and crisp. Excellent chips arrived at our door promptly and still warm (temps this evening are about 15 degrees outside, so hot delivery was no small feat). I will definitely call these guys again. My only regret is for my waistline :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite taco restaurant in Champaign Urbana.  It looks very unassuming and somewhat questionable if you don't normally eat truck food. There is an easy menu of flavorful basics: tacos, flour or corn, American and Mexican, tortas, burritos, and guacamole. Everything runs from $2 (tacos) to $8 for a massive burrito. But the star of this place is the elote.  Being from Chicago, elotes are a part of summertime. It's easy to make: cheese, corn on the cob, and chilé but the flavors have to be just right to be authentic. And luckily for us poor central Illinoisians, Motorizado figured it out. For $2.50 you can enjoy this wonderful treat. They do go fast but if you come by at lunch, they usually have it. The service is quick. Just grab two sauces and a Jarritto from the shop next door and you're living the life. Heads up that there is no place to sit except one picnic table that might snap if you sit too long. It's definitely a part of the charm,  lol."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a lovely Saturday afternoon. I've been craving food from a truck after months of watching the food network. Taco Motorizado did not disappoint.  Fair warning before you go: Cash only, no seating available.  A tweet from Champaign Taste sent me in this direction and I had a steak torta. It was loaded with steak, veggies, and cheese. It was messy and fantastic. Easily the best torta I've had. The steak was in small bits and was great; some Mexican restaurants have chewy steak in their food, this was the opposite.  I'm nervous putting this review up in fear the lines will stretch from the parking lot to the intersection of Prospect and Bradley, but I really want this place to stay open.  See CT's review here ... http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN TOWN. Had the Al Pastor, they were amazing. Wedge and El Toro don't hold a candle to the meal I just had. Customer Service was spectacular. I can't wait till my next trip."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love their Elotes. One of the only places in Champaign where I can find a good elote. Tacos are great! Delivery and online ordering is extremely convenient"}
{"text":"Looks very unassuming, but it is a hidden gem in Urbana. Have had tacos, tortas, burritos, etc. and never been disappointed in the quality. Elote is a must!! My only wish is that they would park on campus during lunch hours!!"}
