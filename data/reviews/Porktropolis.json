{"text":"Great BBQ!  Best I've had outside of St Louis.  They have a very nice and courteous staff and were able to help when I had questions.  Try the Manic Mac if you're looking for a Mac n Cheese with a kick.  I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The BBQ is mediocre at best.  Good to great BBQ should be moist and tasty without the addition of sauce.  One of their \"displays\" is an array of their sauces, which indicates they don't have much faith in ability to serve quality BBQ.  

Next, the man taking my order was a jerk.  As a former waiter, cook, dishwasher, and bartender, as well as a successful small business owner, I know that no matter how bad a day you are having, you do not take it out on your customers.  I order the spicy beans, and he said, \"They're hot.\"  I stated, \"That's okay; I'm from Texas.\"  I said that b/c every time someone up here says food is hot it is not very hot save for some Asian restaurants.  He then stated, \"I don't give a crap where you're from, it's hot!\"   

Due to the poor attitude of this man AND the poor quality of the BBQ, I will not be returning and will definitely steer people away from it if I have the chance."}
{"text":"We ate here in January of 2010. It's not a great place to eat (small, not much atmosphere), but was excellent for take-out. The meat was tasty, the sauces were homemade and good, and the portions were generous. We'll definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"This restaurant feels like the sort of place you'd expect to find attached to an old gas station off a rural highway, you know, the kind where the gas pumps are so old they don't accept credit cards. It feels very rustic and do-it-yourself, with big old wooden dinner tables taking the place of booths or diner-style seating. None of this is \"bad\" and it didn't really bother me, mind you, but it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea.

As I came in an employee urged me to sample their barbecue sauces (they offer 10 or so options) which were lined up on a table in little plastic condiment cups, along with a basket of bite-sized bread bits. This immediately struck me as kind of gross: these plastic cups had been sitting in the open air for God knows how long. How many bugs had landed in these sauce cups? Also, how many people had double-dipped in these things? Granted, that's unlikely given the small size of the bread bits, but still. I kind of cringed at the notion of sampling BBQ sauce through this method, but I did sample a few of their \"sweet\" sauces, and both of them were quite tasty. Still, I'd feel much better if the sauce samples were in little squeeze bottles.

I ordered the Exploding Pig, I believe it's called, with their \"Apple\" BBQ sauce and pan-fried potatoes. The sandwich was very good. I'm not any kind of BBQ expert, but they gave me enough sauce (on the side) to saturate the sandwich, which is how I like it, and the meat was tender and juicy and tasty. The potatoes were good in a home-made sort of way. And it was all relatively affordable (I put it in the ~$10/meal \"fast casual\" category). I'm curious to try their ribs next.

If I'm ever in the mood for a BBQ dinner, I will certainly consider Porktropolis over Texas Roadhouse or other Madison options, because the food is tasty. But the down-home, barely-up-to-code feel of the restaurant leaves things to be desired. And please, find a more palatable (and professional) way to present your sauce samples!"}
{"text":"Visited Porktropolis yesterday (8/19/16) and was my first time at their new location. New place is an improvement with much more seating. I had the dry rubbed ribs and they were great. They're served with your choice of bbq sauce. The ribs were flavorful and very tender. I didn't have to fight to get the meat off the ribs. The rib dinner was $25 and included a full rack of ribs, a side and the salad bar. (A half order is on the menu for $15.) For my side I chose the chef's veggie of the day which was sweet potato. It was fine. The salad bar was more extensive than I expected; lots of toppings and salads, and even pickled herring. The lettuce looked like it had been sitting there awhile, but it was still crispy iceberg. But, you come to this place for the meat, not a salad, and the meat is great."}
{"text":"Perhaps the single greatest restaurant in the history of Sun Prairie. Seriously. From the divine swine to the exploding pig, there is not a single item on the menu not worthy of C.H. Bird himself. The owners are extremely friendly, and were very generous in donating to the Sunshine Supper Community Meals when we needed their help. For anyone who lives in Sun Prairie or is just passing through, Porktropolis is  must!"}
{"text":"I had a pulled port sandwich today.  the pork was delicious and I really like the variety of bbq sauces; I had the balsamic & onion.  the cole slaw was tasty too.  the only suggestion I would make for improvements would be to 1) get a better bun - the bun didn't hold up to the generous serving of pork and fell apart, and 2) offer a second serving of sauce (extra price?).  I definitely want to go back and try more from this menu."}
{"text":"First time here and they screw up my order...the cook was in a rage throwing spatulas at the wall. I will NEVER consider going back. Go to SMOKY JOHN's."}
{"text":"The food here is garbage.  I threw out my whole brisket, from the Porktropolis to the TRASH. I'm from Texas and this IS NOT BBQ."}
{"text":"Had the shoulder sandwich. It was very good. Tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly on the right kind of smoker. I hope they last, and they will always be safe next to The Ammo Box. So far, they have removed the scent of failure from this location, and I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the Exploding Pig.  It's like an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  Add habenero BBQ sauce for the win."}
{"text":"Small place, with big flavor!

Everything I've ever had here has been exceptional.
If you're not sure what to get, the owner/cook will be happy to offer up some suggestions.  

Not sure which sauce?  Hit the little sample area with the different flavors by the front door.

The building itself is smaller and it'd be nice if the booths were a little bigger, but it's a minor complaint.  

The food is fantastic.  Everything is succulent and full of flavor.

My $0.02: Try the Pork Brisket with Nola and get the Mac and Cheese"}
{"text":"I think Porktropolis has the BBQ thing nailed.

If Smoky Jon's is \"Best of Madison\", then Porktropolis should be proud because I think their BBQ is way better than Smoky Jon's.

The sides are just not very good, and I would not recommend them.  Each time I bought them with the meat, people other than me were disappointed.

Great choice for carry-out as long as you skip the sides."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after hearing the commercial on the radio that they had brunswick stew. Now being a Southern  woman and growing up with REAL BBQ I was excited to hear that someone had Brunswick Stew. So my husband and I went, the pulled pork was sitting in a pan of greasy water had absolutely no flavor definitely not smoked, and the ribs and brisket weren't any better that my husband ordered and the brunswick stew was the worst and to pay for a little plastic 4oz tasting cup of that was ridiculous,and leaving an open container of bread and sauces on a table for people to try was just disgusting and it is a health violation. I have tried a lot of different BBQ places in Wisconsin for bbq and I have decided that you people need to just stick to drinking because you know nothing about BBQ. If you want to make PHENOMENAL AUTHENTIC BBQ go down south and learn from the GREAT MEN and WOMEN who do it Right! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is not bbq..... This is not bbq...... This is not bbq..... I'm a huge supporter of mom and pop places, but this one needs to go....."}
{"text":"Ate dinner there tonight.  Where to begin....  I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of \"homemade\" mac and cheese.  The pork in the sandwich was tasteless even though there was plenty of it.  The \"homemade\" mac and cheese was the worst mac and cheese I have ever had.  We live in Wisconsin (the diary state) and should not have to settle for anything less than really good mac and cheese.  This had been around for a while for sure.  My husband had the 1/2 ribs with a side of baked potato.  The ribs had no smoke flavor whatsoever.  There was lots of meat on the bones but it was tasteless.  The topping for the potato came in a cup and it was nasty (cheese mixed with sour cream we think).  The dining room was dirty (floor had not been vacuumed and it was 5:30 pm).  The tile floor was dirty and sticky.  The surroundings were white walls with a lame attempt at \"Vintage BBQ\" with old farm elements.  When we paid our bill we asked the waitress how they were preparing their meat and she said for now, because it is almost winter they are doing the meat in a oven.  Well that explains the tasteless meat for sure, the rest needs work!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends, colleagues, and guests at our office all love Porktropolis. We take any opportunity to go that presents itself. The food is always fantastic, and I don't believe that there is a better barbecue place in all of the Madison area. The dining area is fairly small, but I've never had a problem getting a table when we decide to eat in. The sauce variety is enough to make the same dish a different experience each time, and the owners seem to genuinely appreciate our presence every time. I cannot say enough about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very tasty bbq.  Lots of different sauces are set out for sampling.  There is seating but it's a pretty no-frills atmosphere.  That's part of the charm, but I wouldn't suggest this place for a business luncheon or a romantic date.  But if you want tasty bbq, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I am traveling from NYC to Sun Prairie to visit my staff, I will make sure to stop by this place with the boys for some heavenly BBQ. I have eaten here twice and the place does not disappoint. The food is great and the owner sure knows how to treat his customers. 

@ Porktropolis BBQ - enjoying the split brisket/pulled pork sandwich with habanero and manic smokin Mac n Cheese and a local cream soda."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ you can find in Wisconsin! If you like Speed Queen in Milwaukee or Smoky Johns in Madison, you will love this place too.

The meat is cooked with a dry rub, Kansas City style, but if you want to smother your meat with sauce like they do in Memphis then you have 6-8 varieties of sauces with different flavors and heats to choose from.

The sides and desserts are also good. I have eaten here three times, with three different entrees and sides and have not been disappointed.

If you are looking for a sit-down meal there are a few tables, but the joint caters more to the take-out crowd."}
{"text":"I have been to many BBQ places, including some in Kansas City, and this is one of the best. They have a wide variety of sauces and sides also. The jalapeno cornbread is a nice spin on a traditional side. Portion sizes are plentiful also!"}
{"text":"Great pork foods. Had the beef & pork brisket with amazing apple barbecue sauce, so Yummy!!! Spicy corn was great, hard to eat but so good!!"}
{"text":"Where is the smoke?  It was okay but brisket tasted like it had been in the holding tank way to long no smoke ring no color bland dry roast beef flavor pork was ok. But again no smoke. Sauce is a condiment not the star of the show."}
{"text":"Dry rubbed Brisket. That's what keeps me coming back here. They have yummy Mac and cheese as a side."}
{"text":"Very underseasoned, unsmoked brisket and flavorless sauce with cherry pie filling served by slovenly and unfriendly help. The meat seemed boiled. Never going back. Wildly disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious first visit. Dine in. The mac and cheese was super hot, but reasonable portion, so maybe ask to taste."}
{"text":"Porktropolis is kind of a hard place  to find ,but if you like barbecued pulled pork sandwiches it's worth the search! I ordered the Exploding pig it was on slightly grilled dark rye, it looked kinda small until I picked it up, it was heavy and fully stuffed. A very good sandwich of jucy tender meats . Your choice of sauces to sample but the sandwich is to good  to doctor up and the Manic Mac and cheese is very spicy!!, nice place."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant because I happened to be at the nearby Middle School for an event.  The service was fantastic and the BBQ some of the best I ever had.  I find myself seriously considering driving 70 miles to get BBQ.  It's that fabulous."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the brisket and pulled pork were just cooked in a slow cooker or steamed.  No smoke flavor at all.  Spicy mac and cheese was okay, but nothing great.  This place seriously underwhelms for a bbq joint.  

The dining area is pretty crappy, but I would have cared less if the que was good.  Instead I felt like I was eating a bad potluck dinner in a craphole.  

The sauce selection was decent.  I thought the Carolina vinegar and mustard were pretty average.  The Memphis sauce was decent for a sweet sauce.  

Overall, it's very clear that I won't be back.  And so I continue my search for high quality bbq in this town."}
{"text":"I was looking for someplace new to try for lunch near work in Sun Prairie.  I looked on Yelp and found Porktropolis and most reviews were good, but a few were sketchy but decided to find out for myself.  Nice, light, clean place.  Greeted pleasantly by a gent I suspect was the owner and he asked if he could help with the menu.  There are many options and they all sounded good.  They also have a really cool dipping bar with soem decent bread so you can try the sauces.  It was clean, and I tried the apple and Carolina and both were excellent.  (I have lived in several cities and had barbecue just about everywhere in the country.)  

I ordered the beef and pork brisket sandwich and a side of creamy cole slaw.  Took maybe 2-3 minutes for my sandwich to come out, although it was not too crowded, and during my wait the affable owner chatted with me about current events.  So my experience with the staff was excellent - they were friendly and efficient.

The sauce comes in a smaller plastic container, so I understand the complaint about not enough, but I asked for two containers of different sauces and that was no trouble at all. The meat was cooked perfectly - juicy and flavorful, but could have used a bit more salt/seasoning, and I can understand the review that criticized the inability to taste the flavors of the rub.  However, the sauce is the deal here.  Both sauces were awesome and it all made for a great sandwich.  I saw someone criticize the slaw. Mine was creamy and excellent and tasted fresh - not sure if they make it there, will have to ask next time.

GREAT experience.  Excellent food, and I suspect all the dishes are.  A little pricey at $8 for a sandwich and side, but overall the experience was great.  I don't understand calling the food average for barbecue.  This is WELL above average, even for Carolina, Texas, KC, Memphis, etc.  The sauce tasting area and the sides also help.  And the place itself is not fancy, but there were plenty of clean tables - it reminded me of hundreds of places in the South.

Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great bar-b-que, certainly one of WI's best! Todd makes his own sauces in many unique flavors; he is also very friendly happy to help make a sandwich selection. Divine swine and exploding pig are great sandwiches. I will be back..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great location (just half a block off of HWY 151) , fast service, and most importantly, AMAZING BBQ!!  Todd,  the owner,  is a very friendly guy,  who makes all of his sauces from scratch ,  and believe me,  he has quite a selection! He even bottles them,  so you can take some with you. So... If you ever find yourself in Sun Prairie, WI, with a wicked case of the munchies,  check out Porktropolis. You'll be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"Nope...never again.  If you order take-out, check your order before you go.  My ribs and chicken were dry as leather...kind of tasted like it too.  Big disappointment!  Waste of money too.  Chicken was flavorless and oven roasted..I thought it would have been smoked...it is a BBQ joint right?  Ribs were so dry..they resembled jersey.  Cornbread muffin looked my mom's made from a Jiffy mix.  If you have expectations of good BBQ, you won't find it here.  Then again, maybe when you eat in they serve you fresh food and save the leftovers from lunch to the to-go crowd for dinner.  Never again!  Blah!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a no frills place.  I had the pulled pork with campfire potatoes.  I got more than enough food (I had leftovers for lunch) and felt it was a good fix for my taste for bbq.  I would recommend going for the drinks in the cooler to the left, lots of choices outside the box.  One thing I regret not getting on my first excursion-chocolate bacon.  I'll go back there again."}
{"text":"Yet another great trip to Porktropolis! I ordered the Exploding Pig with the mac & cheese. Wow! The sandwich was full of flavor and had tons of....you guessed it pork!

My daughter once again enjoyed the pulled chicken and the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs. Had 1/2 rack with 2 sides for $12.50. Choose the Great Garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Had ribs with Habanero sauce. This sauce is amazing. Probably the best ribs in the Madison area. Todd is the owner and he is passionate about pork -- and this really makes a HUGE impact in the food."}
{"text":"This is the best barbeque in Wisconsin.  If you like alot of sauce on your sandwich, just make sure to ask for an extra sauce.  I've loved all of the different sauces I've tried and the owner is super friendly!  With the size of the sandwiches, you definitely get your money's worth...this is worth the stop if you're in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket with NOLA sauce, very solid. Slaw was good, too. Kind of a hole in the wall - not the best dining room decor, but good que. Very fast service."}
{"text":"I was running late and starving on Friday afternoon. I had to drive right by Porktropolis to get home, so I stopped by for some grub. I got the pulled pork sandwich with Door County cherry sauce, mac and cheese on the side. The sandwich was really good, but I could have used about 50% more sauce (they have a little tasting station by the register for the different sauces, which I appreciated). The mac and cheese was divine. I could have eaten a gallon. 

The two guys working there were extremely friendly, which I appreciated. It was after lunchtime, so service was immediate, and I appreciated that, too. (You know how it is, sometimes you go to a place after the normal eating time and nobody can help you right away if they're catching up on other duties.)"}
{"text":"This is hard. The staff are very friendly and the pulled pork and brisket are sooooooooooooooo good. The sauces are nice but I hate making choices. I'd rather just eat the sauce someone chooses for me so long as it is quality sauce. I have no doubt Porktropolis puts quality ingredients in their sauces and even use top quality meats too. I just wish my ribs were ...... whats the word. i don't know. I keep trying the ribs every time I go and they are just meh. I want them to be like really good and they're bland. Very good meat and they are cooked great but I can't taste any flavor from rub or smoke. Otherwise, I have always been blown away with the sandwiches and the pulled pork. Yum. I'll never give up on PorkT for the pulled meats. They rock my world. especially when I'm in the mood for some comfort food like the kind I get when I visit my family down south"}
{"text":"Good food, not so great atmosphere. Porktropolis is great for a quick dinner - pulled pork and barbecue sauce is always top notch. Have never eaten inside but inside is pretty lackluster. Service is always super fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Love it--the Exploding Pig sandwich. Learn it. Get it. Live it.

Return visit was as great as the first.  Had to have the Exploding Pig again.  (Hot pulled pork, bacon, pit ham, melted cheese, and other lusciousness on grilled rye).  Best sandwich I've ever had.  Friendly service and a great sandwich.

Dining area is small but they are moving to a larger space this July!  In addition to a larger space and waitstaff, we hear they will have an expanded menu, including a Friday southern-styled fish fry. 

Looking forward to sharing thoughts soon on their new location and menu soon!  See you there!"}
{"text":"They serve their ribs dry, you can use such sauce as you desire.  Ribs were done well, maybe a bit too done, but not bad.  Their dry rub is pretty bland but they have a variety of sauces available to chooose from. Mild smoke flavor. 

Service was fast and friendly, prices pretty standard. 

There is a salad bar so if you buy the dinner you get an awful lot of food."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is good! My favorite is the split brisket with NOLA sauce and spicy mac and cheese."}
{"text":"How did I miss this place?!  I have heard so much about Porktropolis and who does not love the fun name?

My husband and I got take out. We ordered the 3-way platter. It comes with two 1/2 pound meat options and a half rack of ribs. It comes with two sides as well. $25.00. Not a bad deal.

The pulled pork was good. Nothing outstanding but adding their Mmm Mmm Mustard brings it to the next level. The brisket was also great, a good pairing with the NOLA sauce. When you go in there, they have a basket of bread where you can try all of their sauces. BRILLIANT!  I made educated decisions.  I didn't try the ribs, so I can not speak to them.

Our meal came with two cornbread muffins. And wow, were they moist and delicious. I am not a cornbread fan but this was a stand out muffin. The sides left a great deal to be desired. The skillet fried potatoes were just that. Nothing special. The mac and cheese was boring. Mushy, possibly straight out of a box of off brand mac and cheese. Skip it. I was really disappointed. Mac and cheese is my favorite BBQ side. We chose Porktropolis just for the mac."}
{"text":"Porktropolis is Saucy! For July 4th, we ordered a precooked pig from Porktropolis. When we picked up the pig, the guys were super helpful and friendly. They walked us through everything we needed to do to keep the pig warm on the grill and pull the meat when we were ready to eat.  The pig included a selection of 4 sauces.  And, one thing I've learned about BBQ is how important sauces can be.  The apple BBQ sauce was top notch. It's sweet with a hot finish. The mustard BBQ sauce had good heat without having an overpowering 'mustardy' flavor.  I enjoyed these two sauces so much that I didn't take time to sample others. I'm anxious to try the other sauces they offer -- including the habanero sauce."}
{"text":"Blown away every time I go here. The menu is varied, vibrant and the neverending parade of sauces lets you try something new every time. Try the pork brisket with scorched aronia berry!"}
{"text":"Porktropolis is consistently my favorite place to eat in Sun Prairie. The brisket is so flavorful, & if you're hungry, the Exploding Pig sandwich can't be beat. 
I enjoy tasting the sauces that are laid out for sample, and oftentimes they are trying out new flavors, never satisfied to just stand pat. The owner is always willing to offer his thoughts on the best pairings and flavor combos. Calico beans are terrific as well 
The dining room is small but intimate. I usually grab my food to go anyways."}
{"text":"I love Porktropolis! They have a convenient location, speedy service, and the best barbeque you can expect from a restaurant in Wisconsin. Love the Sweet Memphis sauce and spicy Mac and Cheese. We always get takeout, I haven't actually had a meal at the restaurant yet."}
{"text":"The split brisket and exploding pig are our favorites.  I always seem to gravitate to NOLA sauce but be sure to sample for your taste."}
{"text":"This place has the worst beef brisket that I ever tried.  I got a pound of beef brisket was boiled contains mostly fat.  I went back to ask for something else but she said there is nothing she can do.  I honestly threw the whole plate in the garbage and did not have dinner because it cost me $15 which was all I had.  My whole apartment smells of boiled low quality beef. I never in my life have ever thrown food away.  I respect food as a chef and was my worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ place; I had the pulled pork and it was fantastic. They do a dry rub that's great. My only complaint was that I didn't get any sauce for my sandwich, which comes dry. Next time I'll be sure to request BBQ sauce or make sure it's included. When we visited, I believe they had just opened and may have been ironing out the kinks. 
For sides, I had the potatoes and beans and liked both. The side of potatoes is pretty large. I'd recommend getting it to go, maybe call ahead- the dining room is small and I wouldn't want to eat there."}
{"text":"New Location in downtown Sun Prairie. They were great before and still are at the new location. Free samples of ALL their sauces even before you order. Never seen that before. A great BBQ place."}
{"text":"Always get take out because I'm a bit addicted. Best pulled pork around. Cole slaw on top. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I'm a fan on BBQ! I love it, and I love to try new BBQ places and see where they rate.
I'm giving this place a solid 3 stars because It didn't fall flat on it's face, nor did it make me jump up and down and yell \"It's better than Rudy's in Texas!\" 

The ribs: I had a half rack, and I was given a extra little chunk, so that scores bonus points for me!!! They were a dry run, which I definitely did enjoy eating but still prefer a sauce soaked/I need a bib rib. They were lacking some moisture, but I think that comes from their pre heating process or maybe they were a little over cooked?

The beef brisket: This is hard to say because I love brisket, but how they did it was not to my liking. The 1/2 lbs. I had was cut up into very fine cross sections, meaning no big chunks of meat what so ever (small thin slices chopped up) . I found this to be some what strange considering the large amounts of brisket I've inhaled over the years. So, it was hard to eat. It lacked seasoning, and the taste I was getting was coming for the BBQ standard Memphis sauce I went with (which was similar to Sweet Baby Ray's, it was tasty). 

The pulled pork: Somewhat better than the brisket. It was moist but still lacked that extra fatty  punch I was looking for. Again, they chopped the heck out of it before giving it to me...what is with that? Give me some chunks of stringy meat already!

They have a great sauce selection, and a tasting booth when you walk in. That was a really cool idea, but somewhat unsanitary considering there was a guy standing over it coughing his lungs out, clearly not their fault, but still kind of gross. 
Maybe put the sauces you have for sample in pump containers or squirt bottles? I really wanted to try them all but just could not do it after seeing the gross patron spread his yuck all over the little cups sitting out.  

Great corn bread muffins! 

Great Cole Slaw, it was standard Cole Slaw, hard to mess up.

The chopped potato's were a fun side that you don't get often in Wisconsin BBQ joints, so I appreciated that. 

The mac and cheese was mushy. It was missing that extra yum factor that would have spoke to me and said, \"oh your so good, eat me more of me\" . That was a bummer, because I love some good homemade mac and cheese. Not sure if this was of not. Probably will not order this side again. 

Like I said, this place is ok. If you want BBQ in a pinch and are in the proximity of this location give it a shot. For the person really loving dry rubbed BBQ, it might be exactly what your craving."}
{"text":"We went here again recently, and I found it's still hanging around the 2 star mark.  I tried Susan's salmon sandwich.  The menu says its flavored with brown sugar and lime, but mine wasn't.  In fact they give you the sauce of your choice to go with it just like they do with the ribs.  I chose Door County cherry BBQ sauce.  It was just ok.  The sides come with the meal so I decided to try the coleslaw and sweet potato salad.  They use yams for the sweet potato salad, and it just wasn't for me.  I am a hardcore potato salad weirdo, and the smokey sweetness of this concoction was unappealing to me.  The coleslaw was ok, but I've never been a big fan of any coleslaw.  

My dining companions both had a half rack of ribs with the sweet memphis BBQ sauce.  They really liked both the meat and the sauce, but they only give you a tiny little cup of sauce to pour on your ribs.  I would say they were fairly pissed when they realized just how little sauce was provided for the amount of meat they got.  

The jalapeno cornbread that comes as a standard side was blazing hot, yet crumbly dry.  I tried to cut it in half to butter it and it crumbled to pieces.  It's not like I kung fu'd it in half with my hand either, it just turned to a crumbly mess.  

The sides are abysmal, and the amount of sauce given is wholly inadequate.  

A slice of bacon covered in chocolate is 1.25, one of my dining companions thought that was tasty fun.  However, I would avoid the sides from now on.  Even if they are automatically included, I'd say \"keep them, I don't want them.\"  It would just be extra garbage to throw away later.      

I really want to like this place, especially because the dudes who work here are really cool.  But I need more sauce!!  MORE MORE!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love but disliked the bland and mushy mac and cheese, near raw and tasteless (except for onion flavor) skillet potatoes, and the pulled chicken flavor and appearance. Bone in it didn't help (discovered once it was in my mouth). Partner had pulled pork and finished it.

I read in the newspaper article in the restaurant that there had been some different sides a few years ago. Those should come back. If I don't like the side options it makes it hard to come back for just meat.

Other things to note:
Sodas in cans.
No frills establishment, just a few tables right inside the door. You look upon the stock room and restroom. 
Might be worth a try for carry out if you decide to take a chance.

No return for me."}
{"text":"I've done take out bulk just meats no sides few times and it's been from very good to not so much. Loved the ribs first time - baby backs meaty moist good taste naked or slathered. Last time the first couple at ends of rack were dry side.
Sausage was quite good, pulled pork &  brisket was OK as well and prices are reasonable-  $16 for a rack of ribs no sides."}
{"text":"Very pleased to have discovered this place.  A simple but superb menu of BBQ options. Highly recommend the pork brisket and the manic mac.  Great takeout options and reasonable prices. I would much rather eat here than Smoky Jons."}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly - I love barbeque. I mean, I really love it. I love Texas barbeque, Memphis, Carolina, Kansas City, dry rub, sauced; you name it, I love it. When I travel I get barbeque wherever I possibly can. I have been known to reroute my connecting flight in order to get some wonderful barbeque. I have eaten it everywhere and I'm here to tell you that these guys in this weird, unlikely location are making some pretty decent BBQ.

I tried three items. Beef brisket is my favorite so I went for that first. It was thinly sliced, juicy and delicious. It had a nice smoked flavor. Smoking, of course is the the key to any good BBQ. These guys smoke their own meat right at the place and you can tell immediately. I will say that I prefer brisket to be sliced thicker, about 1/4\" thick with some fat. Slicing it this thin can really dry it out.

I also tried the pulled pork. A thing of beauty. Wonderfully juicy and tender with little areas of char and smoke. Lastly I tried a cut that I've never heard of; they call it pork brisket but it is really the pectoral muscle of the pig. It has a similar grain and texture to beef brisket. It was uniquely delicious with it's own spice right on the meat. 

That's not all. These guys have the most amazing selection of sauces I've ever tried. There were no less than ten options, all of which you can try on the way in. Each one had us amazed. There are regional classics like Kansas City and Carolina mustard but also very unique sauces like balsamic and onion, or Scorched berry. It was difficult to decide which to try so we got four different ones. (By the way, sauce should never be ON the meat - it's something you should apply yourself). 

Service was very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place due to being a local but it did not cure my bbq crave. Ribs, brisket and pork brisket was bland. They can call bs on me but I believe all the meats were cooked in the oven. No smoke ring on any of the meats. Ribs were dry, brisket ended up being shredded brisket and pork brisket was dry. Maybe I went at the wrong time but bbq loses all its integrity when you leave your meats on a steam table. On the plus side, the bbq sauces were very good. R.i.p Porktropolis"}
{"text":"After several (hundred?) visits I have realized that I had yet to review Porktropolis.  Every time is better than the last.  Today was the first time that my wife, son, and I decided to dine-in.  What a great experience!

We were immediately welcomed by the owner when we arrived and shown the menu and sauce selection.  It took my wife a while to decide and she was asked if she had any questions or would like any suggestions. As we ordered, the owner asked if we would like him to fix a plate for our two-year-old which he happily did (and our son happily enjoyed).

The wait was minimal in the seating area.  I had to take a quick phone call outside and by the time I came back our orders were on the table.  I went with the Divine Swine with Amazing Apple (though I usually go with the Exploding Pig, I decided to be adventurous) and my wife chose the pulled pork with Sweet Memphis.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and prepared.  We really wouldn't have needed the side sauces had they not been so delicious.  Our son destroyed his chicken, mac, and cornbread (which is a rarity these days).

I won't lie.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the skillet fried potatoes, but that wasn't why I was there.  This trip was all about the pig.  Customer service was phenomenal.  We were treated like those dining that were regulars.  In short: Love it. Love everything about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to move to Sun Prairie about a year ago, especially when we heard of a place called Porktropolis (how could you go wrong??)!

After several attempts to go to the restaurant (they have weird hours, closed a lot of days and close early some days), we finally went on a Friday night.  You get to go in and choose your type of BBQ sauce to put on your meat.  My husband and I each got pulled pork sandwiches with different BBQ sauces.  

What a disappointment!  Like one reviewer said, I wanted to love it but it was not very good.  The pork was incredibly dry and had a weird, greasy consistency at the same time.  My mac and cheese side was really mushy and not very flavorful.  It was a really disappointing experience.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?  The waitress said that the pulled pork is their signature...

Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch right around noon. It smelled great inside! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (Wolf's Revenge) which included one side. I ordered their \"Skillet Fried Potatoes: and a small \"Red Pepper Macaroni & Cheese\" side in addition. It also includes one choice of sauce so I picked \"Sweet Memphis Blues.\"
There's something missing on everything but the sauce for me. The potatoes were cooked well, but had next to no discernible flavor or seasoning. The Macaroni & Cheese was blatantly re-heated from a day or two before, dry and greasy. I found few red peppers for spice, but other than that, it didn't taste anything different from something left in my fridge for a few days. 
For some reason I expected the pork to be smoked, but it clearly wasn't. HOWEVER, it was very tender, with next to no seasoning. The sauce I picked was excellent and I'd pick it over anything in the stores anyday. The container had enough sauce for the sandwich, a generous portion of pork on a kaiser roll, and I had a little leftover for the potatoes, which AGAIN needed SOMEthing more. 
I'll go back again for the sandwich again in a heartbeat, and I'm curious about their coleslaw and possibly the calico beans. Bags of chips are available as sides, pretty chintzy bags for $1.00 if you ask me. I have no desire to attempt the potatoes or mac n cheese again."}
{"text":"The sauce!! Sooo good. Great garlic, amazing apple, Yummmm. I always get the pulled pork but the boys favorite is the exploding pig. A must stop for BBQ lovers."}
{"text":"Wow! This place definitely doesn't look like much as your drive by, but it's certainly a hidden gem. It's a small restaurant with only a few tables. When we were there, there was only one person manning the register and doing all of the food prep as well. I can see it taking a while if it was busy, but geez, it was worth it! We've had the pulled pork, ribs, and the exploding pig sandwich. All were great!

They offer many choices of bbq sauces and have a sampling station set up so you can taste them before making your choice.

Five stars!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Fast and delicious.  Sauces were unique (try the door county cherry).  Small inside but everyone was warm and welcoming.  Nice to have rolls of paper towels for messy eaters (me) on the tables.  Fun to also get bottled root beer (blumers).  Will def stop again next time we drive through."}
{"text":"Great place if you looking for bbq.  Local restaurant, great sauces,quick food.  Great place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to their truck today and was turned off from the moment I ordered food. The guys were rude even when there were only 2 people behind me. I had the divine swine and it was soggy mush. I pulled the filling off the soaked and non-toasted bread and ate the pork mixture with the Carolina vinegar. Not very good, but I did like their vinegar, it has a nice zing. Dining mate had the pulled pork sandwich and was equally turned off as her bun was also soaked through. Bbq sauce was just okay. Sides were forgettable. Not sure if I will try it again."}
{"text":"The food is average for BBQ, but in Wisconsin, we're not known as a BBQ Mecca, so we'll take what we can get.  The real value to this place in the sauces available.  The guy knows how to make sauces.  Everything else is lacking.

The prices are too high for what you get.  The service is okay.  Don't dine-in, though--it's not very comfy and welcoming.  They just set-up a couple of old kitchen tables and put them in a corner."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for dinner.  They were very helpful with explaining the menu and their many BBQ sauces.  The food was great.  Even the salads were homemade.  We will be back again.  Not a vegan type of place!  :)"}
{"text":"This little place is pretty good.  I had the Exploding Pig, which was very good though pretty messy (what else do you expect with bbq though).  My wife had the pulled pork which I thought was average.  I didn't get any flavor from the rub they use, if they use one at all.  The sides were decent, we had the slaw and potato salad.  This is okay bbq and the best option in the Sun Prairie area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Sauces are original and flavorful, meats are tender and perfectly seasoned, sandwich portions are huge, and the prices give you a full meal under $10!! 10/10, would drive from Madison again to eat here any day!!"}
{"text":"I am from the south and I can say one thing. Y'all cannot make pork products of any kind. The sauces are blatant rip offs of Stubb's. Also the skinny dude you got running that place when you aren't around is a unfriendly person who should never under any circumstances have to deal with people for a living. I don't like leaving harsh comments like this but this place left a bad taste in my mouth. I was promised this was the best of the best. I avoided it for a long time. I wish I had kept avoiding. At that note maybe I was there on a off day I don't know but after spending almost $100 on a few pounds of meat to take home I can't afford that lesson twice. Stick with Smokey Jon's The Farley's can't be wrong look at how big they are."}
{"text":"Always excellent service! I dine in and the staff is so sweet and accommodating. The food is stellar! I always get the ribs whenever I go but I've tried many things and haven't had a bad bite yet! Plus, how can you resist bring able to choose from so many sauces?! That sells me every time. I love the decor--hodge podged dining tables and chairs. Plus, it's FAST. I order and within 5 minutes my ribs are ready for eating. So great!"}
