{"text":"Just waited 30 mins to learn that they were no longer taking orders until they could fulfill all the people's orders who were currently waiting for food. I understand it's family day and the restaurant was busy but this wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"Their tahini sauce is amazing. Go there for that.  The place is welcome in the neighbourhood because of the cool vibe. The Arais \"Lamb & Beef Kebab Filled Pita, Yam, Tahini, Spicy Tomato Salad\" that I tried was not great. It was two little triangles of yummy filled pita and a tiny slice of yam but for that price $15, I expected something that was an entree size meal not a stingy couple mouthfuls. The tomato salad was not seasoned at all, so it was not spicy, not interesting at all.  Go there for a coffee and a delicious (but way overpriced, especially for the neighbourhood) piece of halva, get some tahini to go but don't eat any of their savory items unless you have a bottomless pocketbook."}
{"text":"I had the Arais, Parallel salad and hummus to go.  I was illegally parked.  Long, long wait.  Buzzer thing didn't work.  Food somewhat overpriced but all delicious and fantastic!  Loved it.  The pita is thicker than typical pita and it seemed very filling. Beautiful space.  Noisy, chaotic though.  No parking anywhere.  Very stressful experience - which food and eating should not be.  I hope Geary Ave. gets more accessible."}
{"text":"This place moved up quickly on the bookmarked places. I am not that familiar with this area as don't venture out here much. This place is nestled in an odd mixture of workshops , industrial warehouse (I think I even heard a few lathe machines at work on a Saturday as well) and an odd park on what seems like a back road. I think they have done well with the space they got as they kept the industrial structure and added neat touches that somehow bring character to this place.  The restaurant was packed for starters. The ordering system seems straightforward. One orders at the cashier and gets a buzzer and food is brought over.  We ordered the following: Labneh: I am neutral to this dish. This one is a better take on the one's I have tried. Seasoned well with nice olive oil and sweet roasted garlic and tomatoes to boot. Comes with a pita which was very hefty.  Shashuka: this dish seems to have become the norm as I see it almost everywhere. A better take on this dish as not as oily as the one I tried recently at the other place.  Arais: I am a big fan of this dish and almost seek out the places that serve it so was looking forward to it. Hmm plated nicely it wasn't the version I am used to as way heftier owing to the pita bread they have here. Spiced well though a bit oily again due to the thick pita. The yam on the side was good. Decent take on this dish.  The service is functional which is just fine for this space. I missed out on the highly recommended flafel though. I will be back I think to just try that out. 3.5 stars with a potential for a 4 star."}
{"text":"First visit and nothing but rave reviews. Each sharing plate was excellent. The hummus was silky and divine and the green falafel were infused with mint and the best since eating in Tel Aviv. The kofta and the lamb with polenta were well seasoned. Finally the service by wait staff and the owners are amazing in describing every dish. Leave room for the halva. Far and away the Best Middle Eastern experience I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Thank you to the other reviewer for also noticing my review was hidden   because of a Yelp algorithm. I was surprised to see that - I had come back to reassess my own words on it.   I stand by it, as I simply described what happened at this restaurant that we were genuinely looking forward to having brunch at. My husband works in food and we gave them the benefit of the doubt as long as could that day.   The food is good and we like the concept, but it is a bit overpriced. Otherwise, the music is too loud, there appear to be too many (under-trained) staff which seemed to result in a general lack of hustle, enthusiasm and organization, and the electronic system doesn't work well if at all.   Perhaps go if it's not busy and you have a lot of time and patience. I hope this is useful to both customers and Parallel."}
{"text":"Really impressed. When the chef came over with the falafels he said they'd be the best we'd ever tried. His confidence was well founded! They were the perfect texture: light, soft, fresh tasting, and with a dark, crisp exterior. Also had labneh and a lamb pita, both of which were excellent. Really nice, airy space and a solid americano to boot. Great addition to an up and coming strip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a cool industrial building, very hipster if you're into that, but even if you're not the food is fantastic!  We came for dinner on a Wednesday evening at 630PM. There were 4 of us. We were seated right away, which was great. There's parking on the side streets in the area, but it can be difficult to get a spot. You have to circle a couple of times.   We ordered the truffle hummus (3.5/5) - I wish it had more truffle and was less watery, but overall it was delicious wish mushrooms and an incredible green mint sauce and labneh.  We got the special of the evening which was roasted cauliflower (4.5/5), drizzled with tumeric aioli and beet tahini - incredible! There were also walnuts in it, which added a nice crunch.   The lamb shawarma with polenta was delicious (5/5), with Brussel sprouts and melt in your mouth lamb.   The mafrum was also nice (4/5); it tasted like a meat moussaka, with couscous.   The eggplant was delicious (4/5) - good tahini taste to it and served with challah bread.   Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Parallel was absolutely not on my radar at all, but a glowing tweet from a prominent Toronto food writer ensured that I'd be there sooner rather than later.  The place is basically in the middle of a small industrial area, so it's not super easy to get to, but it's definitely worth the effort. I ate:  Arais (\"Lamb & Beef Kebab Filled Pita, Yam, Tahini, Spicy Tomato Salad\"): First of all, the crew at Parallel gets points for presentation. This is a stunner of a dish. And it tastes amazing, too. The Lamb & Beef Kebab Filled Pita is a little on the small side, admittedly, but it's bursting with flavor. The salad and yam are quite good as well, but it's the layer of creamy, delicious tahini underneath it all that really solidifies this dish as a true winner.  I'm definitely curious to try some of Parallel's other dishes, if what I ate on my first visit is any indication."}
{"text":"Parallel is such a great addition to the food scene on Geary!  I stopped for a quick bite with my grandfather. It felt a bit hipster when we walked in, but he liked the food and the friendly staff. We were greeted by warm smiles and were offered samples of halva. The halva is made in-house; both samples had a great taste and texture. The roast beef sandwich was amazing! So flavourful. The pita was fresh. It's was served with a salad that burst with flavour -- the fresh mint and dressing were delightful. The turmeric latte had the perfect amount of turmeric. I'll definitely be back soon!  Parking is limited because it's a busy street and there are many businesses -- mechanic shops, restaurants, bakery, etc. -- in the area, but you can find a spot within a block or two."}
{"text":"It's truly a wonderful thing to eat elevated simple foods like this. Fresh . Tasty.  Falafel balls are more flavourful than any other I've eaten. Hummus so creamy. I only had a couple of items but I'll be back. First impressions were very good."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe. Unique options and flavors among restaurants. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love - and gush about - Parallel, but I can honestly say that my experience, in its entirety, was underwhelming. While the food was good, it wasn't overly memorable, and there were too many kinks to give our dinner more than two stars.   Parallel is set in an industrial space and, though it's \"hipster cool\", the restaurant is very, VERY loud. It was difficult and, at times, impossible, to hear my dinner companion. Our conversation consisted mostly of \"Sorry, what did you say?\" Tables were also painfully close together.  To add to this, the service was rushed. We shared a few items (the hummus, a salad and a main), and asked that the hummus be brought first, as an appetizer (be warned, by the way, that the hummus, at $9, comes with one small pita TO SHARE. ONE. Seriously?!). We barely had time to dig in before the salad showed up on our (tiny) table, very shortly followed by our \"hot\" main dish. It was impossible to work our way through the hummus and salad without the main getting cold, which it did, and very quickly, I might add. This is NOT fast food (as is indicated by the prices), and yet it felt like it was \"fast food\" service. It wasn't enjoyable to be hurried through our meal, and any establishment that understands good service understands that this is a big no-no.  I won't be running back to Parallel. There are better establishments in Toronto, in my opinion, serving similar food."}
{"text":"After stumbling upon this place, it's all I can think about.  The place is a store front and cafe for what really is a tahini-erie. I.e these guys are grinding sesame seeds with a refurbished stone grinder from Syria that's 150 years old, to make silky smooth tahini. They currently have three flavours, beet, smoked, and regular. All of which are excellent, the smoked being my personal favourite.   In terms of the cafe, they have some really interesting modern twists on classic dishes, but not straying too far. The menu is small but packed with flavour (and fat, so great for vegeterians, but a splurge for calorie counters). From the Israeli middle eastern side, you'll find the mushroom hummus dish (they call truffle hummus) and from the Lebanese side, Arais. It's hard finding a good Arais in Toronto, and theirs is really quite good. The halwa's have interesting fusion North American flavours. The juices/shakes are significant.    But by far, the star for me is their falafel. I was born and raised in the Middle East, and I'm in and around the region fairly often, but no one has made falafel this good in my life. Bravo to these guys.   To sum it up, come here for a modern take on middle eastern food, not straying too far from the original dishes. Note that this is a cafe however at the end of the day, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Parallel for brunch yesterday after coming across a positive review by a newspaper critic and Yelpl! It was packed and very disorganzied.  We walked in to find a lineup, where you then order your food and pay at the front (ala fast food), then if you're sitting in the very loud upper level, they'll bring it to you.  Otherwise I think you have to pick it up yourself.  You also have to get your own cutlery (there were no forks upstairs), napkins, water, etc.  When our food came it was one dish at a time with at least 10-15min between each.  Not ideal if you're not sharing, but we were. We had the Black Sabbath, which was a huge piece of spongy, untoasted bread, with eggs and 'black tahini' sauce which tasted more like overly choclatey mole.  It was gross.  The salad that came on the side was a laughable portion in a small bowl, maybe three bites and nothing special.  Then we had the Shakshuka, which had a nice spice level, but the eggs were hard and overdone.  Lastly we had the falafel that everyone raves about and couldn't eat more than a few bites which tasted liked grass. I've had many falafal and this was not good. Then you are expected to bus your own table.  So basically they have a  fast food setup at bistro prices for food that falls way short. I have no idea why there were so many people there, but I'm guessing this is a fad that will fade sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review as the food is 4 stars.  With food better than average and visually appealing... the service unfortunately failed quite miserably.  Not only for me but for most other patrons to the point people walked out after the order screw ups, lost orders, and not refunding the full amount paid for a meal never received (we heard they only refunded the food and not the tip... what??).  In a new hot spot on Geary St, Parallell is in a converted old garage space.  It's modern hipster cool as the exposed ceilings on the vaulted 2(+?) stories stands among the commercial machines.  It has it's own little indoor herb garden as well.  It reminds me of a very cool loft space.  The kitchen is open among the incredibly busy setting... we arrived to a huge line up.  Tables were all fully taken and we were told the line up wasn't moving because they were no longer taking orders.  Quick note about the parking situation... good god it's hard.  You need to probably drive around a few times to find a legal parking spot.  Only street parking is available... if you can find it.    Service here is what failed Parallel to live up to it's fullest potential.  On a Saturday, to call it organized chaos would be generous.  It was dazed and confused, haphazard, and lazy.  Often times, it felt most people (other than the cooks) were just dialing it in.  The line up was at least 20 minutes long before we even got to the front to even order.  The person at the cashier looked stunned... as if they were unable to do more than go 'uh huh' because of the mounting line up and pressure to do things quickly.  He never explained once how the place worked... I learned the hard way, coffees were different than the food ordering, it's mostly self service as you get your own utensils, water, and return the dishes, and you should have someone in your party get a table before you even get to the ordering.  It would have been nice to get a minute intro to that or be able to read something along the very long line before hand.  As for the food delivery... very confused servers may give you the right order.  They are not sure what they're handing to you all the time and can actually give you the wrong dish to the wrong person. What maybe neat but totally doesn't work is that you get a numbered buzzer that helps track the location of the number so the servers should know where to deliver.  It doesn't work in practice as we saw a few times wrong delivery to wrong tables and then they take buzzer away to only let people to receive half orders with no recourse to get the rest of the meal.  Just... unfortunate.  Chopped Salad - This is not your Canadian Grandma chopped salad.  This is a full on onion assault on your taste buds.  There are no leaves to this salad but it has cucumbers, (lots of) onions, parsley, tomatoes, chick peas, boiled egg, and nicely heated tahini.  It was a nice light lunch for those who want a bold flavour.  I just found it a bit too strong on the onion but that's just me. 3.5/5  Parallel Salad - A visually stunning salad with the vibrant raspberry pink beet tahini drizzled over a lush salad of kale, sweet potatoes, goat cheese, walnuts, and a bit of lentils.  The citrus dressing on the leaves was a nice burst of light flavour to cut through the more richer tahini.  Just a great vibrant light lunch salad.  4/5  Falafel - The star of the food dishes... honestly, really good.  I've been on a major search in the GTA to find a falafel half as good as the ones I've had in Dubai.  It's been a desperate search but Parallel has made some deliciously spiced and nicely crispy versions that reminds me of my time in UAE.  The crunchy exterior gives way to a vibrant emerald green and deliciously spiced (is that garlic and cumin I detect?).  This came fairly fresh and hot from the kitchen with a bit of mild creamy tahini.  Very good.  4/5  Flat White - Highly acidic and barely drinkable.  I dont think we made it half way through this cup.  It was very sour as if the oils on the bean turned rancid a bit.  It didn't make for a good way to end the meal.  2/5  I did read a 1 star review from the couple near us who had to leave empty handed because of the service screw ups.  I believe they werent refunded everything they paid for no food either.  It's unfortunate they took down that review as I don't know the full account but heard enough.  Actually, there are a few 1 or 2 star reviews on this place that has gone missing all of a sudden.  It's really quite weird.    I do want to say if they do improve the service, it would be a great casual lunch spot.  With what I experienced, it was pretty terrible and I dont think I could in good conscious recommend this spot ... even with the best falafels I've found in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy.  Causal open space, good service and great food. Hummus and parallel salad were standouts but all delish"}
{"text":"Checked out the newly opened Parallel this week and had the most amazing Shakshuka ($13). The ripe tomato sauce was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of onions, garlic, cumin and paprika to give it an earthy, spicy taste while also bringing out the natural sweetness of the tomatoes. The two organic eggs were perfectly poached and the side of organic pita was a light and fluffy medium to scoop up all that deliciousness. Sadly, I only noticed that you could add on goat cheese, roasted bell peppers and  roasted eggplant (for an additional fee of course) to the shakshuka after I had already made my order. I will definitely be adding that goat cheese and eggplant for sure next time - it sounds absolutely divine! Want to amp up you shakshuka even more? Make it a Hammshuka ($14) by putting it on a bed of homemade hummus! The shakshuka comes with a small side salad but that was fairly simple and doesn't hold a candle to the main dish.  The vibe here is really neat with an industrial feel and open concept so that you can see almost everything that's going on. The star ingredient at Parallel is their sesame-butter (tahini) which comes in 3 different flavours and can be purchased in jars at the front of the store. You can also see and smell the tahini being made fresh in front of you in their stone mill that is located right next to the dining area.  Sadly this is another one of those places that's less accessible for those of us on the 9-5 grind. Currently open Monday-Friday between 10am-5pm, I would highly recommend swinging by for a quick lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Geary Ave is in for a treat! I am in love with this new middle eastern restaurant and coffee bar.   I was blown away by the stunning industrial design of this place. Beautiful bright restaurant in the main space, and a window-lined place for coffee and co-working at the top-back.   I came in for a full lunch and had the lamb sandwich, falafel, pita and delicious, delicious dips and I can't wait to return and have it all again. The lamb sandwich was a true standout. Tender perfection.   Lastly, their house-made tahini is also perfection and deserves its own paragraph. Here is said paragraph."}
