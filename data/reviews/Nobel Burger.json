{"text":"Cold fries, lukewarm gravy, overcooked burger and slow service. So...standard airport food. At least its better than that gross deli/cafe right after security! Worth the walk just for the expensive wine..."}
{"text":"soup: good
tacos: okay
burger: TERRIBLE

overpriced"}
{"text":"Had some all day breakfast before a flight to Florida in May.

I really dig the iPad set up for ordering and browsing while you wait. It also gives you flight updates from your gate. 

The food was A-Ok, standard eggs and bacon done properly. However that exact same dish would cost me $5 at a greasy spoon and I don't care to double that price for the iPad airport experience."}
{"text":"Service is slow and non existent. Burgers are over priced. Never got utensils and they did not remove previous patrons cups until prompted. Overall this exeriance does not meet the baseline expectation. They were sold out of half the items and ran out of napkins....avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and drinks with a poor veggie selection.  For an airport restaurant,  i would think they could offer something better than mushroom burgers for non-meat eaters"}
{"text":"Technology and a good food premise draws you in - crappy service, cold food and disappointment is all you leave with. 45 minutes and they couldn't get my burger to me. Go to other options in term 3 - avoid this one."}
{"text":"I loved it.  Self-ordering, immediate service, free games, decent suggested tip, it was a great experience, and I can't wait to fly from this terminal again to come to this bar!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had. Make your own with chipotle sour cream, cheddar, pickle and tomato. Fries were a bit greasy but the burger was great!"}
{"text":"Ultra modern, sleek ipads to place your order.  The burgers are damn pricey but good to the last bite.  I fly a lot and the favourite part about airports to me are visiting the pubs and having delicious burgers before boarding the flight where they serve you an food that leaves much to be desired! The ingredients used here are fresh, inspired and the buns are soft and just the right size to perfectly complement the generous patty.  

I am taking off a star because the service was really quite poor.  EVERYONE has complained about the service, perhaps it's about time the managers deal with their staff so the food can get the reviews it deserves! I will go back because although the waiters were useless, the food was terrific."}
{"text":"Great concept, poor execution. Had some time to kill and thought this looked like a great place to stop for a burger. Ordered a basic burger, onion rings and a glass and a half of their daily red wine.  With their 18% gratuity it was a little over $38.  The wine arrived promptly and was at the right temp and was acceptable. 

The burger and rings arrived in a reasonable amount of time and were completely underwhelming for a place that calls itself a burger bar. An onion ring dropped on the fl√≤or as she served my plate, she apologized and left it there. The burger patty was dry and had chunks of chewy crust that indicated they likely use bread crumbs as a binder and filler or they just cooked the sh#t out of it.   The onion rings looked good but we're greasy.
Bottom line, come for a drink but I would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"$15 for a poor omelette, few hash browns and one piece of bread. It was not toasted. If you're going to spend $15 go to Starbucks across from it. At least you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"Really crappy service!! If you are paying so much for food you would think you would get a least get decent customer service. The burger wasn't that tasty either. You're better off just grabbing Starbucks."}
{"text":"Drinks came after burger was served even though order placed at same time. I had to ask waitress. Burgers are expensive but tasty"}
{"text":"Greasy, overcooked burgers only outdone by the soggy, greasy fries. For $30 meal, you would think they could top off the soda. Then you have to deal with their flashing iPad in your face for the entire meal. Best part? You have to tip in advance - which doesn't at all help. Saw the waiter once, when he delivered the food. Just gross - you would be better off grabbing a snack from the local newspaper shop."}
{"text":"Let's start with service.  First, they don't seat you.  You wander into the table area and hover over other people as they eat, hoping you've picked the one that won't pull out their computer and do 45 minutes of e-mails after they eat.

Second, you order on this dated and slow iPad.  Full of greasy finger prints from other diners.  All our orders came back wrong.  When ordering a burger it shows a picture (and no description) of a burger and fries.  One would think the burger came with fries.  Oh no, but besides, \"we're out of fries\".  Turns out the they are out of a lot of things.

Third, napkins aren't delivered with the food.  You  have to ask 4 times before they bring you one.

Tiny, overcooked, greasy, and expensive burger.  The bun is 2X the size of the burger.  Beer served warm.  How much better can it get?!

Disgusting.

Avoid this dump at all costs!"}
{"text":"The burger and fries were satisfying.
The service was fast once I placed my order via the iPad.  It's clean and an interesting place to watch the passengers moving through the airport terminal."}
{"text":"Yes this place is terrible   I had a very dry chicken burger for high price. The iPad ordering system was stupid. Took me 10 minutes to figure out. Around me, 3 people left in frustration before ordering."}
{"text":"Ordered toast: it was cold. Ordered oatmeal: was soggy and overly sweet. Seriously worried the food would make me sick.

My meal was free but I still felt cheated."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes, I confirmed with my receipt time, for a dry and cold burger. Lousy service. Hot onion rings though."}
{"text":"First of all it's the airport so the food will be overpriced but this place has some good stuff which I don't mind paying if I'm hungry before a flight. The awesome thing is ordering through the iPads and paying from there which saves some time but however it says 15 mins on the iPad, but depending on how busy the flights and staff is. Can take your order 15-40 minutes to arrive. Yes bummer but if you have time before your flight, the food is worth it. Poutine $11, coury crunch burger and veggie burger is around $15, Brownie is $6. Yes over priced but the quality of these meals were on point. Since it's the only restaurant in that terminal and a tiny one, it's hard for them to manage the crowds of passengers. So have to be patient or don't order if you don't have at least 30 mins before your flight."}
{"text":"Nothing nobel about this experience.  It's a self order process using iPADs - and is totally confusing.  First you have to input your flight destination, which is completely counterintuitive to ordering a burger.  Then, the order flow requires you to go back and forth to add that $4 small coke.  Finally - you swipe your own card at your seat, and they suggest an 18% tip.  For what?  No one has greeted me, answered a question, or even made eye contact.  And I'm at the Niger bar!...   In the end, the food is overpriced and under-whelming (chicken sandwich seems pressed in order to ensure no juices are remaining?.....).  It just seems like all the processes are in place for the kitchen, and not the customer.  Nothing nobel in that...."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Omelette and bacon were severely under cooked. $2 extra for egg whites. $5 for a hot bottle of water."}
{"text":"This is a seat yourself restaurant in a busy terminal. So busy that there is a lineup to get in. However the entire wait staff simply ignores the line and it becomes every man for yourself. If you are more than 1 and it is a busy day then skip this restaurant. The iPads at the table make no sense either as people just sit there playing with the iPads while you stand there waiting for a seat. Also, their menu screen only actually shows the menu for a short period every 10 minutes or so. The rest of the time it shows useless pics of wine. So the menu will be a mystery to you until you sit down. Which our party of 2 wasn't able to do. We eventually gave up. Who designed this place???"}
{"text":"Finally found a place to sit down. Ordered from an ipad with a guarantee to be served in 15 minutes and left hungry after 25. The man in front of us said that he had waited 45 minutes to be served. Would have waited longer, except our flight was about to be called in 5 minutes and we at least wanted to pick up something for the flight."}
{"text":"iPad ordering is a cool concept but the burgers are pricey so what do you expect for an airport eatery. Taste wise it was just ok and even though it comes across as gourmet it's NOT! The bun was very disappointing and it wasn't the freshest either. Service was good as my waitress was attentive and polite. Unfortunately, she works with an idiot that sings songs about how much they hate their job and that she wants to shoot someone in the face. C'mon! Really? Oh...then there's the goof that was barking at everyone in the most unprofessional way like he was a manager. If he was OTG needs to fire this guy. You can't just bully employees in front of customers. Smarten up. That sums it up...$32 later and a Cocktail. I got hosed. Oh well. Off to Vegas I go."}
{"text":"Typical OTG experience. If you travel through NYC area airports you likely know OTG well. Seat yourself, order and pay for your food from an iPad, then wait and pray that something similar to what you ordered comes in a reasonable amount of time, and hope it is edible. 

This OTG \"experience\" is located in the Toronto to US Terminal. I ordered a burger with fries and a soda. $22. It was edible. That's it. I found the burger bland and slightly over cooked. Fries were not flavorful at all so I dumped a lot of salt on them. 

I only ate here cause I was stuck there for 5 hours during flight delays. 

You eat here cause you have to, not because you want to."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Burger was good but nothing special and gravy for fries must have come from a jar. $28 for a burger fries with gravy and a Canadian. Wow. 

Service was awful. I waited 30 minutes for this overpriced meal. In an airport they should know we all have flights to catch."}
{"text":"EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE. Seriously. I fly into Toronto twice a month and was really excited to see a new addition, since freshii next door was always closed off (now it's not). So I ordered a veggie burger with cheddar and Brie and a coconut cake pie thing. I waited about 20 minutes for my burger which was grilled so long the cheddar had DISINTEGRATED. No lie. I took the burger back and asked where is the cheddar and they said \"you can see te outline of it on the burger\". WELL NOW. good thing there was a small slice of Brie on it or I would've been cheese-less. Still waited for the coconut pie which after another ten minutes they realized they were out of coconut and offered me rhubarb. Ok fine I'll take that. I've already inhaled the dry burger and waited for my rhubarb pie. GUESS WHAT?? All warmed on the sides and still pretty frozen in the center. So I wound up eating only the edges of my pie because that was the only warmed up part. What a friggin waste. Never again. I'll take my money to Freshii."}
{"text":"This is a very cool spot to eat before a flight.  Located at terminal 3 besides A11.  Patrons order from a tablet( iPod)  with pictures of the items and prices ( CDN).   They have appetizers, salads, burgers and sandwiches, sides, poutine, desserts, wine (red and white) by the glass or bottle ( my kind of place), spirits, cocktails, non alcoholic drinks, beer, coffee and tea, vegetarian, gluten free, inflight snacks and an under 12 kids menu.  The kitchen is open and located behind the bar.  There are seats at the bar and tables in the surrounding area.  All with a view of the outside and the bar.  There are 3 tvs and the tablets at each seat has games, weather, flight times, facebook, internet, apps for banking and travel.  
Service is quick and the waiter comes out, asks how you are doing and provides help on ordering.
The food:   The chicken poutine is very tasty.  Gotta have poutine while in Canada!"}
{"text":"You know things have gone wrong at the airport if you have enough time or are hungry enough and bored enough to eat here.

It's everything you expect!"}
{"text":"Crummy burger and fries for $25?! Incredible.  They must think this is Tokyo. Or is Tokyo cheaper?"}
{"text":"Why do I make the critical error of showing up at the airport starving? This was adjacent to my gate and I was tired and lazy. I liked that you order via iPad so you know exactly how much your customizations will cost you. 

I had a veggie burger, fries and iced tea. The tea did come with free refills...if you can grab a server. My veggie burger was disappointing..heavy and mushy with too much bun. The fries were better but probably too salty for me but would fine for others probably. The tea was good and strong. 

I liked that I could zone out at the bar and use their tablet to read the news or play a brainless game...but I read my book instead.

Service was quick."}
{"text":"Watering hole at Tom Pearson while I waited for my delayed flight.  Prices were better than at some of the Newark Int'l Airport watering holes.  Service was very good and wait staff was friendly and brought orders quickly.  I did not like the close quarters on the high tops, and would have loved to be seated at their tables but they were all taken."}
{"text":"Had a Long Island (good), glass of wine, and Cobb Salad during my 3 hour wait at the gate.  The Cobb salad description on the menu has a typo (\"comprised 'off' farm-fresh poultry\") that should have tipped me off to the fact that the photo advertises avocado when there isn't actually any avocado in the salad.  Ultimately, edible, but read the descriptions before you continue with your order!"}
{"text":"Pros: it's easy to pay and get service
Tacos are good

Cons: expensive for what you get
Food images do not match what you get
Manhattan was watered down
Guacamole has cheap chips and it tastes like premade guac
I have had a really rude bartender there
Kids chicken tenders are super processed meat

Overall I have been there multiple times and I am always disappointed with the experience, food, and drinks"}
{"text":"... well I thought it was fine. You want cheap food? Don't go to airports. 

My beer was poured and at my right hand as soon as I completed my order. The burger wasn't far behind. Staff was friendly and adequately attentive, considering the iPad ordering system. I disagree with reviews to the contrary, but maybe the Sunday evening crew was just on their game this weekend."}
{"text":"Did a build your own burger as it was hard to find something with both bacon and cheese. I ordered through the iPad, I would've been happier ordering from a human. The toppings choices are limited, don't know if this is the iPad or the place, but I couldn't get lettuce or onions on my burg. The burger itself was overcooked and dry. I'd stay away from this place's burgers.

The beer is priced like expensive pints but come in bottles.

I like the food choices in Terminal 1."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and even so service was mediocre. Fries were good but $4 for a handful or fries. Burger was alright but bacon, lettuce, tomato and no cheese was $11. Whole bill for burger and fries drinking water with tax and tip was $19.50."}
{"text":"The one star is for the Waiter.  Perfect example of how efficiency in technology falls short of providing quality customer service.  First, the layout of the restaurant /bar area; it's open to all (customers and non customers waiting for their flights).  The appeal is the stations to recharge phones etc.  You have to hover over people to get a seat. I was seated at a table with other strangers, not a big deal. Only one of the Ipads were working to place my order.  What you see is what I got, wine, burger and fries. No silverware, or napkins (had to ask for them). The man across from me placed his order minutes after mine for a drink and it didn't come. When questioned the waitstaff explained that the bartender didn't notify him that the beer was out of stock, therefore the order was not filled.  When I asked to speak to the Manager I was given no apology,  only \"we're working out the kinks\".  A busy airport where travelers have a short window of time to get a meal before their flight is not a place to \"work out the kinks\".  The food was over priced, for being toed a burger bar, you don't even get a choice to select how you want it cooked.  I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Decent food and fast delivery paired with excellent customer service (one of my dishes had an issue and they replaced it was a very tasty, higher priced item of my choice and added a drink on top of it!)
Absolutely to recommend."}
{"text":"Dry and way over cooked burgers. Pricey. Servers were ok. Fries weren't too bad either."}
{"text":"This place not only has poor food but it is an absolute rip-off. It is like airport dining in the 80s where you get bad food for high prices. The tablet ordering procedure ensures you get poor service."}
{"text":"Like all other reviews service sucks. You can ask multiple time never get what you asked for. Had a okay burger that was over priced. My drink never came even when I asked multiple time. Definitely looking elsewhere when I am at this airport."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. Quick service. Can't complain. Ordering on iPad is a bit impersonal but was good"}
{"text":"This seemed like the only appetizing food joint in Terminal 3 after my flight was delayed and my stomach craved something savoury. The 3 stars are for the setup and speed of ordering and delivering food. The iPads are nice and the burger came in just 10 minutes.

The burger itself was reminiscent of something straight off the grill at a high school reunion - bland, overcooked and not the best quality meat. The price did not justify the quality of the burger. Luckily, I managed to escape the norm of $14-16 per burger and additional $4 for fries with just spending $10. I just got the build your own burger and picked all the free toppings (why are the toppings $2 each?!) and sauced it up with the chipotle aioli. The bun and chipotle sauce were the only good parts of the meal. However, the food got the job done and was quick and easy to deliver. This would beat fast food only if the price justified the quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the toronto airport, terminal 3, A gates. Overall, it was not exactly wowed by the place but it was a okay option as I waited to my delayed flight back to the US.

The pros:
1. Nifty ipad ordering process, it gives you an overview of exactly what the items on the menu look like and is straightforward in ordering and billing.
2. Clean and refreshing environment
3. Courteous and professional staff. Quick to bring out my beers and food (when it was finally done).

The cons:
1. Long waiting time. I am not sure if my order got lost or if it simply took a while to cook, but I received my food after the two people next to me, who sat down after I did. So... hmm. However, the manager did notice and come over to check on it as she saw me dawdling around  the ipad games.
2. The burger: I ordered a burger (I think it was called the YYZ burger as the menu online is outdated and I could not verify what I ordered) which had coleslaw, a maple chipotle bbq sauce and crispy onion rings. All very good ingredients for a juicy burger. Two things:
    a.) the burger ordering from the ipad didn't allow me specify what style of burger I want (how I wanted it cooked) or else I missed it completely. Either because they are all made one way or because it seems to have been forgotten (see above), by the time it got to me it was super dry. sigh. 
   b.) it was SUPER spicy. Now, I know that all restaurants are allowed their own interpretation of spice levels and taste of ingredients. However, as three of the ingredients are coleslaw (creamy), BBQ (usually sweeter), and Maple (sweet), I was expecting this burger to be on the sweet end. Quite the opposite. It favored the 'chipotle' quite heavily and found myself repeatedly reaching for my beer for burn level. Just not what I expected. 

3. My own pet peeve, the pay and tipping process: As you order off the iPad, you have to pay in advance of getting your food. Now, I'm not normally a complainer when a food items is not up to par (unless they SEVERLY mess it up - then i say something), but what if I had severe issues with my food? 
This establishment is meant to be more 'upscale' and thereby should be more geared to fussy customers; so how would the amendment process have gone? 

The space would have made it awkward to fix the 'pay system' after the items had been purchased if it was done at the table or the bar (very little space), and I am not sure what the backend system looks like as it flows from the iPads to the cooking system. 

Then, the machine prompts you at a 15% tip rate. However, as the ordering process is self-serve and the manager only visits you by chance if you food is not coming out. The servers are thereby no more than foodrunner who occassionally pour a beer (so basic bartenders). The tipping system should be set at the traditional 10% tip rate for bartenders or foodrunners (or even less), considering there is no way an individual customer or even the bar itself can hold responsible/give credit to any individual waiter for the service component expected from this position. They do try to send someone out to check on your, but it's not tied on the system for the customer to acknowledge who is serving them. 

All things that didn't make this particular experience too great. Hopefully I am able to enjoy this place in a future visit with a better experience."}
{"text":"People working very hard and most of the time they right on top of empty glasses quickly refilling workout alasking. Food is very good but not cheap (airport prices).  Ordering and paying are with iPads you don't have to wait for server taking orders.  I've been eating here for close to a year weekly and still loving it."}
{"text":"Decent grub. The automation makes service pretty in-human. Airport pricing, so get your wallet out for ho-hum food!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on this place I was a little uneasy trying it.  None the less I like to make my own judgment.  Other than being a bit over priced I was quite pleased with the burger.  The burger was a nice size and was super tasty.  To me it was a typical burger.  Not too much made the burger stand out than the average burger place.  Next time I find myself at the airport id probably eat there again."}
{"text":"So I hear that airport food is never fresh. Not just airplane food, even the food in the airport because of strict regulations and whatnot. So when I arrived at this swanky bar with iPads, I'm thinking: \"Here we go, $18 for a dry, mediocre, patty with limp lettuce\".

But no! It was $14 for a surprisingly decent burger! I don't know if they've lowered the prices recently, but that's what I paid. That seems on par with some moderate American restaurants in a popular area and it's nice not to break the bank before my trip even began. I built my own burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and my friend ordered the breakfast burger complete with a very beautiful fried egg and bacon. Our conclusion was that they were both good burgers! 

Of course, you can't compare it to other burgers, only to other airport options. The bun was soft, the toppings were fresh, and the beef patty was, gasp, juicy! Even the bacon in the breakfast burger was well done and not chewy dry pork strips. My other friend went with chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were tender and those fries could have been served at a good wing place. Very binge-worthy. 

While the food was a surprise hit, the service was a bit of a miss. The staff were friendly and the food arrived in good time, but the tables were filthy. Dirty plates that were next to us weren't taken away until we asked them to, even though people came by to take our order and then again to drop off our drinks. Ah well...it is the airport after all. There has to be disappointment somewhere. 

(37/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of burgers.  They are so yummy.  This place is really busy but we got lucky with the manager giving us a little of his time.  Definitely will com back when traveling out yyz"}
{"text":"Got a chicken w/cheese sandwich, onion rings and a water as I waited for my flight.  The sandwich was surprisingly very good, and so were the onion rings.  I didn't expect much because it was airport food but I would order it again if given the opportunity.

Service was also relatively quick, which is important as you are waiting for your flight. The chicken sandwich took approximately 12 minutes to make.  

Initially when I ordered I placed it to stay then realized that I wanted to go sit by my gate and would need take-out.  I asked one of the servers after I placed the order and it wasn't a problem.

Once I got my sandwich I needed extra mustard, some ketchup and mayonnaise --asked once my food arrived and I didn't get any attitude---also pleasantly surprised.   Oh yah, their mayonnaise is really good too--not sure what herbs they put in it.

My friend had the same sandwich without cheese and she loved it.

Onion rings were hot, crispy and good!"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Sent my burger back as it arrived on a dirty plate.  Took forever to clean my dining area from the previous customer.  Eventually did it myself.  Terrible hygiene and service.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Sat at an iPad table. Delta was late so I got fish and chips. iPad and cc pay pad was not mapped so the waiter / IT geek-squad had to pull it out of fire. Anyhow meal was good. Aggravating experience for all."}
{"text":"I'll rate this according to other airport restaurants. Typical iPad ordering system. I'm not sure how \"made to order\" the burgers are as there are a bunch in the display that they used for orders. I got the Montreal burger and it wasn't bad. Be warned the beef brisket is just a thin, barely visible slice. The Poutine is a nice size for something that's considered a side.

Not bad for airport food. Still wish there were better options. But having hot food is better than the grab and go options. Starbucks is across the way in the terminal, but it's not like they have better food."}
{"text":"There is a learning curve here.  It takes some thought to get the iPad ordering concept down.  After you get the navigation if the menu down, it is quite convenient for the next time.   Three stars - which is perhaps as much stars as an airport restaurant can muster.  Nice veggie burger, but would customize it next time."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant at Toronto Pearson Airport Terminal 3.  Great way to wait for your flight.  You sit down in front of an iPad and place your order.  You pay right there and your food is brought to you.  While you wait you have access to free Internet access, games, news, weather, etc.

Food arrives pretty quickly and the burger is great.  Surprisingly good considering your in an airport, so are the fries.  Of course it is incredibly expensive, but again not unusual for airport restaurants.  You can use the iPad to ask for your server, and the service is fast and friendly.

Overall a great airport dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place only has 2 stars. For an airport bar and eatery this place is quite nice. They provide iPads and free internet access at each seat which you also order your food and drink from. The fries were great and the beer was nice and cold. 

The service provided to me while on a ~4 hour delay (don't fly Delta) was great. The manager all of the staff was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Horrible. Airport food. Completely tasteless Nobel burger absolutely hands down the worst burger I have ever eaten. The meat looked steamed needed salt and spices not even mustard ketchup or mayo on it neither wax it offered. The fried were laden in oil. Literally dripping in oil. And so small you couldn't even dip them in the tablespoon of ketchup they give you. Save your money and wait till you land to eat something!!!!!!  Airplane food tastes better !!!!! Oh and if you go and email yourself the receipt you will never get it and it will be too late to get it from the server."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've had.
Made sure I made extra time to get to the airport to grab one of their burgers.
I did create my own so I could pick & choose what I wanted on it rather than picking it off after the fact.
They were aware I had a flight leaving soon and got it to me just in time"}
{"text":"I experienced terrible service here. For example:

#1 - Waited in line to order from the menu posted by the register. Got to the register and learned that menu was only for people sitting at tables. Got a table.

#2 - Tried to order a burger from the posted menu only to learn it wasn't available through the iPad app.

#3 - Burger arrives. Unfortunately, it is delivered to the person sitting across from me. About five minutes later we get this sorted out and the plate is passed to me. Nothing like a cold burger served to someone else first.

#4 - Waitress asked if I would like more water. I said yes. No water ever came.

#5 - I asked at least three servers for assistance with paying my bill. They each told me they couldn't do that for me. Finally someone came to do that and was very rushed and unfriendly.

Also, did I mention that this entire process was glacially slow? An unpleasant experience overall. If the food had been good or the internet connection on the iPad was fast, or if the price was reasonable, then I could find a reason to give another star. As it is, I would recommend staying away from here."}
{"text":"More of these restaurants are popping up in airports. it's a convenient place to go for a bite if you're travelling alone or have less time to spare. the seats are designed to be pretty antisocial - an iPad in front of every table and a credit card slot in between. 

you sit where ever you want, order on the iPad, pay, and the food comes soon after. I was travelling with someone else and decided to sit next to each other instead of across so we didn't have iPads in the way.

in terms of food, it wasn't too bad for airport food. while the selection is limited, the burger had decent buns, although the Mexican burger was lacking in jalape√±os. it's also a nice spot to fit in your last routine before you fly off to USA!

overall I would come to a restaurant like this at a restaurant compared to the traditional kind. speed and convenience is everything at the airport."}
{"text":"The idea of an airport burger place where you can plug in and order from an iPad and have the server come and bring your food while you charge/work is great.  The execution, not so much. One, the tables don't seem to be cleaned frequently, as mine was none too clean. Two, their sides are limited--if you want a salad or vegetables, there really are no options other than a full-size (and expensive) salad.  Three and worst of all, though, their burgers are really mediocre.  Limp buns, the caramelized onions and cheddar I ordered with them were meager, the BBQ sauce was nonexistent (maybe they forgot it, or they don't understand the concept of BBQ sauce), and the burger itself was dry. They don't ask you how you want it, so it came out \"dry medium.\" Service was not unfriendly, though relatively perfunctory. Of course, it's all overpriced. If you're desperate for a burger, it will do in a pinch, but if I'd known what the options were, I'd have brought a sandwich from the city or gone to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience.  Terrible service, terrible prices, and most of all, rotten and disgusting food.  I bought a salad from Nobel across the terminal from where my flight was departing from.  When I opened the salad prior to departure, I opened and poured the balsamic dressing on and was caught off guard by two different viscosities: thick and runny.  I thought, \"well, maybe it's just meant to be that way...\"  Oh, how wrong I was.  Nanoseconds into my first bite, gag reflexes engaged and I vomited in my mouth.  It was totally spoiled and all I got for my $12 is a queasy stomach.  Too bad I couldn't run it back and get a refund, but believe me, I'll never give them my service again."}
{"text":"If you are flying to US in Terminal 3 you have a lack of dining options.  The food is OK, nothing great or horrible.  $25 (Canadian) for a burger, fries and drink.  Burger is tiny but good."}
{"text":"Grabbed a sandwich, chips, and a vitamin water from here. It was good, but obscenely expensive. $25 for basically the same crap you would pack in your kids' school lunch."}
{"text":"I have to say the burger here and the service are quite good. Maybe a little expensive but then everything is expensive at the airport."}
{"text":"The iPad on the counter might attract you but then you have to fiddle with ordering. You have to put in your flight information. then it gets lost and you start over. I just clicked on any flight on the list to get started. I was starved.  I ordered a veggie burger. No recognition of whether it's been received.  Just learned--looking at the emailed receipt--that the  machine automatically charges you and adds an 18% tip, No choice.  And that's odd, because there are no humans to interact with. Did I tip the IPad?  OK so I finally shouted to get a human's attention and someone did clean the filthy eating space in front of me, and a while later delivered my veggie burger.  Flash back: Right after I'd ordered and paid for it (in one act), a Good Samaritan said \"Don't order the veggie burger, no matter what.\"  Too late.  But it didn't taste that bad or else I was too hungry to care: it was very mushy, yes, and slithery, but ok.  The problem was that upon first biting into the bun, held in my hands, the burger slid immediately to the plate and disintegrated. It was greased by the avocado, I assume, and there it lay.  One more thing. The bar chairs and all chairs are immoveable.  Screwed to the floor. Just how I felt myself."}
{"text":"I was also quite surprised by the low rating but the place looked clean and decent and close to my gate so I have it a shot.
I ordered guacamole with chips and make your own burger and a glass of Wayne Gretzky's Chardonnay since mojitos were not available today. 
The guacamole tasted good and fresh.
The one mistake I did with burger was ordered a gluten free bun, which turned out to be 2 slices of gluten free bread vs. a bun. So while a little misleading, the burger tasted good and wasn't huge, which was a plus. The service was prompt. Great to know there is actually a decent place to eat at terminal 3. I usually fly from the other side of terminal (gates 1-9) so I had no idea there were other food options down at gate 13. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Terrible and rude waitress!!! 

My boyfriend and I sat down at one of these ipad booths as we were waiting for our flight.  We weren't hungry but the menu and food looked interesting so we decided to order a snack to try it out anyway, so we ordered the poutine through the Ipad.

The poutine ended up taking 45 minutes to arrive.  We called for service through the ipad for 3 times.  We also called for a server in person twice.  Our sever never showed up until 40 minutes has passed.  At the end, when she showed up, I told her that I have ordered a poutine about 40 mintues ago but the poutine still hasn't arrived.  She said, in these exact words \"A poutine was sent back to the kitchen earlier so maybe you weren't here when it arrived.\" I said, \"No, I never left this spot.\" She said, \"Then maybe you didn't hear.\" I was furious.  she walked away and couple minutes later, she brought back a warm poutine in a take out box. (I did not request for take out) When she arrived, I asked her \"When you said I didn't hear you earlier, where exactly were you calling me from, right beside me? or behind me?\" She said, \"Ok, why don't you just relax.\"  

The service was an absolute nightmare.  I had never come across such terrible attitude from a server, especially in an airport. 

Just shortly after I started working on the poutine, I discovered that it was only warm in the bottom, but the top of it was cold so I don't know how long it's been sitting there for.  About 5 minutes after I started eating it, she brought over a poutine in a dish and asked, \"You guys ordered a second one?\" So clearly, she made a mistake, the second one was the one I ordered, not the first one in the take out box.  

In general, this was a horrible experience and I would not eat there again next time I fly."}
{"text":"Two stars for good food.  Service still terrible.  Third time they've forgotten to bring bottled water ordered. Half the time it's next to impossible to pay for your meal.  Since it's the only real place to eat once you are captive in the terminal, I guess they can be as bad as they want to be."}
{"text":"If I can give zero stars I would. No service at all sat down and have this iPad ordering system, without any instructions to refresh prior order. Worst part is, I sat down before another couple and the server complete ignored my presence and set the table for the couple first. I called for services 6 times on the electronic device and no one ever came. Terrible, manager apologized but didn't offer to fix or change future execution."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars. Here's what you need to know...

1. Seat yourself, either at the bar or the tables behind the bar.
2. Order using the I-pad provided at your seat. The order buttons are at the bottom of the screen. While it is not completely intuitive, you can do it.
3. A coke is 3$. Burgers are 13-16$. Fries and onion rings are extra. Hell, even pickles on your burger are an extra buck. If you get burgers, fries, and a coke, expect to be over 25$ after tax and tip.
4. Service is not horrible, but the logic seems to go like this...you will have been looking at their I-pad and won't notice that they haven't noticed you. The place is dirtier than it should be.
5. The burger is decent. It is freshly prepared, but rather smallish, especially for the price. It hides under a large bun.
6. You can order to go burgers or buy snack items from a refrigerated station they have by the register. The service here (I sat at the bar by the register for an hour and observed ) is poor at best. 
7. The to-go snacks are terribly expensive. 4.50 for a Snapple? The prices are not posted here for a reason. I watched as people continually asked. The answer was always \"something like 4-5 dollars\", never a scan to check or specific amount until someone had paid. The snack area is brilliant because it is mainly there to cash in on vouchers provided by airlines for delayed flights. (When Starbucks is cheaper than a kiosk, something is a bit wonky.)

In conclusion, this is at least one more option in a section of Pearson with limited options on everything, including seating, food, etc. Eat here if you are absolutely starving, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"While waiting for a flight to Miami, there weren't a lot of choices in the departure terminal but Nobel Burger looked like a decent place. I sat at a high table in the middle of the waiting area and placed my order through an iPad. It didn't take long for a server to greet me, acknowledge my order, and present me with cutlery and a glass of water. Nice.

My Salisbury Steak arrived shortly after, nicely presented. Wow, that was quick! It was cooked well and tasted very good. The gravy was rich and the fries were crispy. Pretty darn good and better than I expected.

Good food and good service. My only disappointment was paying 4.00 for a (small) glass of Coke."}
{"text":"What's there to do when you arrive at the airport with 3 hrs to kill and your airline club is only on the International side? The Nobel Bar invites people to just sit without having to order. But how much fun would that be? They place an iPad at the bar in front of every barstool. You can search the menu or wander the internet or play games. I looked at the cocktails and decided I would try using this technology. You pick out everything you want including size, garnish, etc. Input your credit card info and the order is on its way. They let you know it's being processed and even inform when it's being delivered. I had the \"Flight Suit\" which is a blend of gin and scotch. Served with a mini gherkin pickle."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Ordering from the iPad was easy. Excellent French fries and Mojito."}
{"text":"There really aren't much options at the A gated in T3
We ordered a regular poutine, guacamole and chips and 2 drinks, and portions are large. It's still quite over priced but most airport restaurants are. The food is nothing gourmet but fresh and tasty enough.
Ordering is simple with credit card from iPads and food was served to your table."}
{"text":"I came in during a delay at YYZ. I thought the iPad ordering would make the process smoother and food delivery quicker. This was not the case. 20 minutes for fries. Also, they take the tip upon ordering so there is no recourse for bad or slow service."}
{"text":"Terminal 3 near gate A14. You can order and pay using the iPads installed at each seat. I love the fact that they have a build your own veggie burger option as well as onion rings and beer which I ordered. The beer was the English Bay Palestinian Ale which was OK.  Get used to the fact that they will come to you and say they ran out of this or that. It happened to me with my original choice of beer as well as the type of cheese on my burger.

One thing I didn't like was since you pay up front you have to tip up front as well which doesn't give incentive for good service.

As a whole, let's keep in mind this is an airport restaurant. The food, service, and process were really good."}
{"text":"Paid 17 for a double of Crown; however, found out they reinvented the standard pour: 1.5oz...3oz for a double!!!!  Did not even get a kiss. Bring the Vaseline if you want to go to eat sub-par food and have overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"Food is fair but overpriced but the cost is somewhat to be expected in an airport. The concept here is progressive..... seat yourself, all tables have iPads what you can order your food on, get flight info, play games....etc.   What fails is first, the shard use iPads on the tables are filthy.... i didn't even want to touch it. No one even speaks to you until your food is ready so you can't really ask questions, ask someone to wipe down the iPad or anything else.

When you order, you pay immediately with a credit card reader that is attached to the table. I was fine white that but if someone wants to pay cash, I guess they are out of luck. 

Also, when you order and pay, they of course ask how much you want to tip right up front. I made the mistake of tipping my usual 20%. Then.... we had horrible service.  

Definitely not my favorite place but I come through this airport only a couple times a year so I guess I learned a lesson."}
{"text":"This is silly. I wanted to sit in an airport bar and have a couple beers, but the self-ordering software wouldn't allow me to order one drink at a time. I called a server over, who confirmed that yes, I would need to order and pay for both before they were delivered. I explained that I did not want both beers at the same time, obviously. She said she'd bring them out separately.

But nope! They both came out at the same time.

More egregious still, diners are required to assess and pay a tip prior to receiving any service. What's the incentive, in that case, to provide quality service? If Canada has a consumer protection agency, I can't imagine they'd like that.

Lastly, when I arrived, my placemat and seat were dirty, so I cleaned them.

Gimmick cannot replace good business practices."}
{"text":"This place is completely terrible. You order on an ipad at your table, which showed me two advertisements before even letting me order.

I ordered a cheese burger poutine, which came with pieces of meat patty, some of which seemed undercooked and some over. The gravy was watery and flavourless. The fries weren't crispy at all, and some were very undercooked. To top it off the machine asks for a tip before you eat, despite having no actual server. I tipped 10% just to ensure they didn't spit in my food, but maybe that mighta added some flavour. Eat here if you have to"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Overpriced really bad food, terrible service, disgusting tables and sticky iPads. This experience doesn't ever warrant a star. The waitresses were confused about who had ordered what. Skip it and go to Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"The service was quick and the food was good.

The place was busy; it's in the airport.

$18 and up for a burger.  A little steep but not uncommon for the location.

People were friendly and were able to get me a gluten free burger.

In a location with limited choices, for options for me to eat, it was good."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes to get my omelette order. It was 9:45am on a Saturday. That's insane.

Unfortunately, the food was not tasty enough to make up for that wait.  The prices are sadly in line with other overpriced airport options, but I'd recommend going to the adjacent Starbucks if you're feeling peckish.

Note: do not order food from the iPads if you're not sitting directly at the bar, otherwise you'll never be able to flag down staff to follow up on your order."}
{"text":"Dropped in here between flights. I figured a nice burger would hit the spot.  The photos of the burgers look great but that's where the similarities end. I ordered the \"Bymark Burger\" which contains Brie cheese, king oyster mushrooms, and lettuce. The mushrooms were so tough they were like rubber and could not bite through them.  I had to remove them from the burger. The meat itself was way too salty.  Had to down my entire coke and needed more.  Not sure if mine was an isolated incident or not. I made the busboy aware and asked him to let the chef know.  There was no response other than him bringing me a refill on my coke and walking away. All in all a very disappointing $22.00 burger and coke."}
{"text":"What do Airport Restaurants try so little to impress their clientele? Do they think there are no regular travellers?? That MUST be it. 

This place sucked. It's was basically $14.00 for an Egg McMuffin!! What the hell is that?? To top is all off it was all electronic ordering & them the server expected a tip...not bloody likely!! 

TRY HARDER PEARSON AIRPORT!!"}
{"text":"Sort of nervous eating someplace with such a low rating, but since the terminal A doesn't have many options (at all), I gave it a shot.

The bar is set up with iPads for easy ordering, but only if you're paying with card. The iPad's also serve as entertainment while you wait for your flight. I didn't use them much, only to order, because I kept thinking of the 1,000's of fingers on this before mine. Buzzkill, I know.

I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries and a coke. Came to around $22 CAD which for airports isn't that bad. It came within ten minutes, probably less.

The chicken was piping hot. Burn your mouth hot. The fries were good. Nicely seasoned. The glass they give you for the coke is rather small and there is no indication that refills are free so I didn't ask.

You can also do takeout and they have a small kiosk on the side for pop, snacks and other sandwiches.

Being honest, the sandwich tasted like a Wendy's chicken sandwich and honestly I love those. It had a more gourmet taste if that even makes sense, but based on reviews of this place it wasn't that bad!"}
{"text":"Love the concept. However, it's clumsily executed. I had a long flight delay, and since I was seriously thirsty, I ordered a drink so I could peruse the menu for lunch. 20 minutes went by. I tried to spot a server, but all I saw were the same unbussed tables as when I sat down. Do I risk ordering food at this point? I hit the server call button a few times and no one responded. 38 minutes after my order, a server arrived and told me they don't have the water I ordered and that they could bring me two small bottles of another brand. At this point, I needed to catch my flight and said I just wanted my money back (the model is that you pay up front when you order, including tip.) so the server disappeared for another 5 minutes before telling me there was no manager present and that she couldn't give me a refund, but that I should try and get in touch with him. ?!?! Seriously regrettable experience."}
{"text":"Food is fast and decent. Everything is significantly overpriced, but it is airport food. At least they cooked it and it tasted good. 

I am definitely not a fan of the iPad ordering system. There is absolutely zero accountability among the waitstaff. I ordered an extra side of pickles ($3) for the burger and two bottles of water for my plane ride. Did not receive either. 

It took me five minutes to attract the attention of a server to get those items and mustard (which arrived in packets). That is because I was not placing a new iPad order, so I simply did not exist to anyone. 

With a drink and wine, I spent about $100 for a burger meal. The experience was not up to that standard."}
{"text":"Overall, a good place for lunch, and/or hang out waiting for your flight. 

Quick tip so you don't look dumb, like I did - you order on the iPad, and the menu button is at the bottom of the screen. :)

The price is comparable to any other overpriced airport restaurant. Service was fast and friendly, and a decent booze selection.

The fries were fantastic, the burger was a little overcooked, but still very tasty with mushrooms, Brie  and truffle oil (om nomnomnom).

Definitely worth a stop, especially if you're enjoying a favorable currency exchange rate."}
{"text":"The food and the drinks here aren't bad - ordered two drinks with gin (of course) and the butter chicken poutine. The poutine was actually pretty decent, lots of chicken and very cheesy. I was super satisfied with the drinks as well.

They have iPads where you can order food from, or browse the web and check your flight. Not sure if it was only the iPad that I was using, but it was super laggy. I wanted to browse some sites but couldn't bare how slow it was so I ended up reading a book instead.

Agree with some Yelpers here, they are terribly slow. People don't order a 3 course meal here and they still take forever to just bring out the drinks."}
{"text":"Easy to order, poor service. 30 minutes to get a drink. 
The place always looks busy because terminal 3 at the Toronto airport has hardly any place to eat. One of my least favorite airports.
Order on iPad and pay in advance with tip.
Tip means\"to insure proper service\". That was a waste of a tip."}
{"text":"Great idea and food. Just needs better service. I love how you order your food on the ipads. However, the ipads are disgusting. They need to be sanitized and the workers here do not do that. The food came out relatively fast. I ordered the appetizer fish tacos and my husband got a burger. He said his burger was nothing special but my tacos were absolutely delicious. But for the price, I wish both items came with a side. If they kept this place cleaner, it would be a solid 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Ordering from an iPad was pretty cool, though it took a while for the burger to come out and it costed a lot (though that's to be expected at an airport). It was a pretty good burger but the patty wasn't super juicy or anything (I work near Burgers Priest and P&L so I have high standards).

The staff are pretty aggressive about cleaning the tables and spend quite a bit of effort to make sure everything is spotless. It's nice, but I'd rather not have to smell Mr. Clean while eating my burger.

Free refills on your (non-alcoholic) drink!"}
{"text":"The concept is technology replaces the human server. Although there are still about six servers running around, you order via the iPad fixed to the table or bar. The process of ordering is simple and the bright color pictures are useful. That is where the good experience ended. I ordered my food and the iPad stated someone would come take my credit card information. It then states your food will be there in less than15 minutes. I followed the process and I waited...and waited...and waited. No drinks were brought to my table, no one came to take my credit card. I found an assistance icon and asked for someone to come to my table. Two times and nothing!  I finally walked up to the bar and asked if they had my order. Oh yes, we have it. I inquired when it would be ready?  Where was my coffee?  They were clueless.  I canceled the order and told them I could not wait any longer. The manager asked if I was leaving, I told him YES!  I have a plane to catch and I had waited thirty minutes for nothing. Ridiculous!  Great concept, but a fail for execution!"}
{"text":"My service expectations are fairly low for an airport hamburger joint; yet, my service experience at Nobel Burger Bar at Toronto Pearson didn't even meet these expectations.  Orders are taken via an iPad that's conveniently located at each table.  The ordering system is a bit cumbersome even for someone who's fairly familiar with technology.  Errors all around.  I gather that these iPads ordering systems are en vogue now, since I see them in airports around the world.  I imagine that part of the reason is the perception of faster service.  No need chasing down the waiter because you can place the order yourself, right?

Wrong.  You'll have to flag down the server because the order will be wrong.  Good luck with that!  I'd say a good 50% of the tables around me had errors with their orders, so you will need to contend with others who are frowning about their orders.
 
Part of the issue may be that those who are running orders don't seem to be paying close attention to which tables are ordering from which iPads.  On several occasions, I saw those that were running the food yell out to the dining room, \"Who ordered the fries?\" or \"Who ordered the XYZ burger?\"

Though the servers were prompt in correcting errors, I was a bit surprised that tipping was expected for this level of service.

Service far out shined the food-- and, unfortunately, given the poor service experience, this was not a good thing.  I can forgive average food if I have an excellent dining experience.  As the other reviewers have already better articulated, the burgers are a bit overpriced for what you get.  Fries with poutine were a soggy mess.  I am not sure what burger I ate, except that I got something other than what I ordered.

My partner also had a similar experience.  Build your own vegetarian burger came out as a meat burger.  I ate my random burger because I do not have these dietary restrictions.  I also wanted to get out of there and not deal with further apparent chaos that would ensue.

In all, a poor service experience with fairly lackluster food, at a time when my service expectations are fairly low.  I don't expect much at an airport-- and unfortunately, this dining experience didn't even meet these low expectations.  I just want to get in, eat, and get out on my flight.   Even this was a challenge. 

Skip Nobel Burger Bar and head for the fast food counter instead."}
{"text":"This burger joint is inside terminal 3, The A gates.  Toronto's airport has stations (large desks with 6-8 chairs with large iPads in front of each chair). You can order food and drinks from  the various restaurants via the iPads and a server brings the food to you.  This is really nice.  Each station has multiple outlets so you can charge your devices while you eat, play games on the iPad or just wait.  In addition to the stations, there are regular airport chairs all around the terminal.  

I ordered a Mediterranean Burger and fried.  The burger contains arugula, feta cheese, tomato, carmelized onions and a balsamic glaze atop a juicy flavorful, handmade beef patty.  I never expected an airport burger to test soooo good.  I give 4 stars for the taste of the burger and another star because they bring it to you AND bust your plates once you have finished eating.  Its as if the entire seating area of the airport is a restaurant.  This was a good meal and experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Should've checked Yelp before ordering. 
I asked for egg to be removed from the breakfast burger. They gave it to me with an egg. I specifically told the server I was allergic to the white orbs of death. What did she care? She was up at 6 in the morning - she had no time for us customers. 
Two chefs, no patrons, yet slow as molasses. Horrible experience. Definitely left $0.00 - which was a first for me, as I always tip (and generously, at that). 
As for the breakfast burger - dry and flavourless. The potato fries were delectable. 
Will be contacting this restaurant's parent company re: nasty attitudes and slow service."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 but it really hit the spot while I was waiting on my flight!! I sat at one of the many iPad ordering tables and ordered poutine and a ceasar. 

The order arrived within 10 minutes of ordering and the poutine was perfect. Not the best I have ever had but still great!! The fries were crispy, plenty of delicious gravy, and real cheese curds. It was great after a long day while waiting for my flight.

The ceasar was spicy and tasty. Fresh lime and olive. It was great! Nice spot for airport layovers or waits!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the food was the service. I wanted a grill cheese but because I wasn't under 12 I would have to pay a premium. Fine. But the Sandwich that showed up looked like it had been soaked overnight in lard. The menu said the sandwich came with a drink but I was charged extra for that too. I'd give it one star but at least it LOOKS nice and each bar seat has an iPad for free web surfing."}
{"text":"Despite the mediocre reviews and the typical disappointing-ness of airport food, I was pleasantly surprised by my meal here at Nobel Burger.

The restaurant is located at the left end of Terminal 3, Concourse A. There is a lot of seating space, and the tables are all equipped with iPads. There's minimal server interaction - you just order at the iPads, then pay, then your food is brought to you. The menu app itself is pretty slick - you can see pictures of all the different items, and many items give you choices, such as extras you can add, whether you need gluten-free bread, etc.

The food itself was better than expected. I started with the mixed greens salad, which was large, tasty, and refreshing. The cheese crumbles were especially creamy and delightful. Then I got the YYZ burger, which was also delicious: the bun was toasty, the patty was juicy, and the toppings added nice flavor complexity.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Overpriced, for sure, but that's par for the course with airport food. I'm not going to show up to the airport early just to eat here, but if I'm stuck waiting in the terminal again, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Delicious burger for an airport location. I was not expecting it to be so good. The glazed onions and feta were a perfect pairing. The meat was very well seasoned. I would have preferred a firmer bun, but it was still very good. I selected fries as my side and they were fries. Nothing spectacular. The service (gate 16 area) was great. The servers were friendly and quick.

This was in Terminal A. You order from an iPad. It's easy to understand and you just pay right there. Bet, very convenient."}
{"text":"Burger was nice it just took 30min! Expensive as well just the burger and a coke no fries for 20$ not the best place to get a meal before your long flight..."}
{"text":"Trendy idea, order and pay on the iPad and receive your food in a timely fashion. 

It might be that we are here at 5:30am, but the food was stale. I ordered the breakfast burger with home fries. It tasted like they re-fried the burger (dry) and the same goes with the home fries. 

Perplexing to me, as you would assume in the morning you would get the freshest food. I think I got a burger made last night at 11pm. *sigh* Should have ordered the smoked salmon. 

My wife ordered the French toast, which she liked for the most part. At the end of her meal though she was eating my stale fries because her meal was too sweet. She did like the fresh fruit thought and the French toast was crisp on the outside soft on the inside. 

Probably will give it another try during peak hours, but as of now it doesn't deserve more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Our last meal at Toronto turned out to be at the airport and since we had an hour delay for our flight we decided to check out this burger bar at the end of our terminal. By the miracle of God we were able to find two seats in the bar, because due to other delays the place was a mad house. The concept here is very futuristic, you order all your food and beverages through a I-pad that is stationed in each chair. We decided to order two traditional cheeseburgers with lettuce, tomato, red onions, ketchup, and mustard. This was welcome surprise the burger was very juicy and well cooked, while the topping were fresh and crisp. The bun was served warm and toasty, the dish also included french fries that were perfectly fried and had the right amount of salt. This might be controversial to say but I feel that this was our best meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I was looking forward to trying one of these gourmet burgers, but the only thing gourmet about this place was the price.

I went for the Mexican Burger, but I wanted it vegetarian. There was no option to order it this way on the iPad. When I called the waitress over, she seemed annoyed and just told me to order it on the iPad. When I showed her that this was not one of the options, she said she would take care of it.

When the burger came it in no way resembled what I had ordered. I did complain, but then she blamed me for ordering it wrong. Even though she told me what to enter and said she would talk to the chef. Of course you have to pay the bill in full at the time of ordering ($30 for burger, drink and tip), so giving me a discount or taking it off the bill wouldn't have been an option. 

The burger was thin, dry and came with nothing. No sides, no garnishes, not even a pickle. It looked so lonely on that rectangular plate. The patty was chewy, overdone, and probably from a package. So much for gourmet.


As much as I would like to support places like Nobel, I wouldn't recommend it. You would be much better off waiting for the pretzels on your flight."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. 40 minutes to get bacon and eggs. The food was cold. No cutlery was given, had to ask twice for it. For a 13$ bacon and eggs you get two slices of bacon. Spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down the hill completely. Dirty tables, slow service, and a manager with excuses. I have been hearing about teething issues ever since they opened and they still haven't resolved any of them. They also removed the only Veggie options they had in their burger menu."}
{"text":"There aren't many options in this terminal so you end up taking what you can get if you have a long layover. 

You order from an iPad with forced viewing of advertising and pay with a credit card when the order is placed. It defaults to an 18% tip which in hindsight was too high with the only service being carrying my order to the table. No refills were offered for my $4 small glass of ice tea. I finished my meal 40 minutes ago and no one has cleared my plate.  Also, I didn't get a receipt which is a problem for business travelers. I tried to enter my email address to get a receipt but the iPad defaulted to a pop up ad while I was typing in my email and afterwards, the receipt option was gone. 

I tried the poutine since it was billed as a local specialty. It consists of french fries with brown gravy and cheese curds. It was okay. It probably would have been better if it came out piping hot instead of barely warm enough."}
{"text":"I'll paint a picture. I am sitting here at one of the individual ordering tables with a delayed flight and a sad burger. 

The burger came in swift. And when It arrived - at my first bite I noticed it was a little over cooked. But then I remembered I was in Canada and so the burgers here have to be cooked more. In terms of the taste of the burger it's flavorful, but once you feel how over cooked it was - it removed the \"experience\" for me - (But again this is because I prefer burgers on the med rare- rare side) Other observations are : the  lettuce was scarce and sprinkled on. The buns were cold and not toasted. But overall an ok burger. 

I will really vouch for the fries I got. Which were The only good thing I had - they were cooked to perfection. 

The TWIST is - the GM ended up coming by and he asked me how my burger was, and after my response he said he would get me something else another burger and or even desert and that he cared about the experience of the visitors. SO.  of course even though the burger was a little over cooked for me.  This place gets points back on the service and approach. 

Dats it."}
{"text":"I ordered my burger thinking I had plenty of time before boarding, but they called us to board minutes after I pressed the order button. I called the server and told him what happened and he reassured me that even if I had to get on the plane he'd bring it inside. He was kidding of course, but I got my burger so fast and had it on the plane. It was well cooked and delicious, although pricey!"}
{"text":"While stranded at the airport due to our flight being delayed- we ended up here with no choice in a sense. Made the best of airport food by getting the Mexican burger, spicy chicken sandwich and a chorizo poutine. Wasn't anything special (as expected) but definitely beats airplane food! Would I come back? The answer is, if there's another flight delay in the future at this terminal!"}
{"text":"This place has tablets around the gate where you can order your food and drinks, which is nice. We ordered the cheeseburger and it was ok, but not worth the $15. You might be better off going to Starbucks for a cheaper sandwich. Table service was great, however."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this is below 3 stars. It's minimum 3 but I'm giving a 4 for being pretty good airport food. I did a build your own burger and my food came out great. Healthy amounts of grilled mushrooms and onions. Nice BBQ sauce spread, cooked good for Canadian standards (aka you can't get medium rare patties in Canada since some crazy burger cooking standards), and the bun was really good. Not bad for killing time at Pearson! My pickles as a side were a nice alternative to fries as I LOVE pickles. Solid beer choice. Food came about 10 mins after ordering. Good for catching a flight. Very happy with my Nobel experience."}
{"text":"Seriously I would not have pay $12 for Egg Any Style with Sausage anywhere. Of course if it has truffle or foie gras in it, that would be a totally different story. 

But at 6:30 am and facing a 3 hour plus flight ahead with someone that is going to be cranky and hungry... I guess this is a price to pay to silent the complaints and  growling from hungry tummy.

We have no problem getting a table and service was fast since it was so early in the morning. Food was ok and my companion was happy with a half full tummy after his breakfast. Food was at least made to order as the eggs were prepared over easy as requested.

I do like the charging station at the tables as it has the USB built right into the electric outlets.

I wonder when YYZ would able to give travelers more dining options especially at post US Security at T3 but having Nobel Burger and even a Starbucks is better than eating cold hard bagels."}
{"text":"If you're at the airport there aren't a lot of options. Unfortunately, their guarantee of food arriving in 15 minutes doesn't pan out. They also only offer cash refunds (odd, since you have to pre pay with a credit card). So, when your food doesn't arrive until your flight is boarding, you'll either get cash (at an international terminal! So it's useless) or nothing at all. Be ready to dispute the charges with your credit card.

Either bring food with you or pick something up from a kiosk."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the seating arrangement sucks, it is fend for yourself. Find an empty table and go for it! I ordered the breakfast burger, you got it...bacon egg and cheese on a burger with onion rings. It was very good and fresh, bur small for the money. Over all this place is pricey, but the food is good. 

A couple of things-you order on an iPad, that is pretty cool, you pay before your food comes including leaving a tip. That is kind of strange, but the waitress and waiter that brought my food were very nice."}
{"text":"I generally like technology more than people and I would say the technology here works pretty good.  I sat down, reviewed the menu on an iPad, placed my order and paid at the terminal between the tables.  It was quick and easy.

It's an airport so the food was over priced but it wasn't actually that outrageous.  For a drink, poutine and a 20% tip is was only $15.   

The only quibble I had is they charged $3 for soda water and I couldn't even get a refill.  

I received my drink and my food pretty quickly.   The server didn't really say much so in retrospect, I don't know why I tipped 20%.   I'd still give something but probably more like 15% since all she did was put down in front of me and never asked if I needed anything."}
{"text":"Fun spot and service is quick. You order off of an iPod and pay immediately which helps a lot when alleviates the pressure on the waiters to help you make your flight.  Tip is pre-determined though, but service is fast. 

We had some fish tacos which were o.k.  Also had some poutine which was pretty good, standard poutine.  Nice gravy, relatively thick fries.  They do also have games on the ipod and internet access."}
{"text":"Wow. Where should I even start? I sat down in the bar area. I had to ask them to clean my seating area and it took them 10 minutes to do that. After ordering (through the iPad in front of me), it took 20 minutes to get my drink (bottled water) and had to ask for that as well. It took a full 40 minutes for my food to come. I ordered a bison burger and the darn bun was twice the size of the meat. The only good thing about my meal were the onion rings. 

This place is an example of poor service and useless technology in the services industry!"}
{"text":"I like the iPad ordering and set up. I was leaving on a morning flight so the kitchen was serving it's breakfast items. I ordered hash browns and orange juice. My order arrived quickly and was cooked perfectly. Slightly salted. Not enough ketchup but they can always give you more.

The drawbacks are that it's noisy and the music and kitchen noise distracts from conversation. Counters need to be wiped better.  I'm used to paying more at the airport but $3.50 for a coffee seems outrageous. There's a Starbucks across the hall they have better coffee at that price.

Overall, food was good and came fast so I'd order here again."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent and fast! 
Food is pretty pricey as most resto in the airport of course. Selections range from light appetizers, full meals to light snacks and desserts. Drinks range from strong espresso wake-uppers to some relaxing shots. 
I always go sit by the bar with free IPAD use. I get to read-up on everything! Lol!! That's for brain food! 
The espresso coffee is good and strong. A good contrast with the light, flavourful and crisp fish on soft tacos.  Happy tummy it is!
I like coming to the airport to check-in early, check-out duty free shops, walkercize and sit by the bar."}
{"text":"I ordered some fries because I'm stuck at the airport for two hours and there is nothing else available. The fries are awful. Soggy, flavourless."}
{"text":"I ordered the Nobel Burger during my layover at Pearson. It was good, but somewhat disappointing. The patty and bun we're fresh but mediocre in size. No sides are included with the order so I would recommend adding some if you're hungry. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall it wasn't a bad meal but if youre going to call yourself a burger bar, you had better serve a fantastic burger to earn 5 stars, even at an airport."}
{"text":"Ate here before I got stuck at Pearson overnight. Contracted food poisoning from one of the burgers and consequently had the worst travel experience of my life. I knew something was off after I finished the burger but I chalked it up to airport food never sitting right. It only went downhill from there and having to return to the gate next to this hellhole in the morning after feeling like death on an airport carpet all night was the final twist of the dagger. I've never given anywhere one star before but the free side of traumatizatiom that came with the burger pushed me to it."}
{"text":"The concept and advertising is great but the delivery needs a lot of work. 

First iPad I sat at didn't work,  the second one worked but often blanked on the keyboard or was illegible which I suppose are more of Apple issues but still. 

The burger I ordered looked nothing like the burger I ordered except that there was a piece of meat between two buns and there's no way to add or remove anything that comes on the burger. 

Service is slow but they make you add gratuity ahead of time so you can't necessarily tip based on service. My food came relatively quickly but the guy across from me said he had been waiting for almost 45 minutes. 

Pricing is typical overpriced airport pricing but I will say the food itself has good flavor. 

If the owners of this concession listened to their customers, read the reviews and made some small changes I'm sure a good portion of the people sitting and using their iPads might order food."}
{"text":"Great concept & I liked using the iPad at the table to order & kill time while waiting.  Unfortunately, after ten minutes I had to ask them to clean the table of the previous customer's dishes and nose hairs (yuck).  You expect the food to be pricey at an airport, but unfortunately it was as mediocre as the service.  The beer was warm, the fries were cold and tasteless, and the burger was just so-so.  

It has great potential, unrealized."}
{"text":"Best airport dining experience. Was looking for a quick bite in between flights and had very little time. In other airports I would have settled for a cold pre-made sandwich, but came across Nobel.  I ordered a gourmet cheeseburger, fries and beer. After using their automated iPad ordering system, my order magically appeared in 5mins! They are fast, efficient, delicious and let me get to my flight on time. Nice oasis in the middle of a hectic airport."}
