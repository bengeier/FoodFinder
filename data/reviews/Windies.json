{"text":"Buddy who is from the islands brought me to Windies recently on a friday evening. Expectations were high as he remebered it being good from his last visit a year of so ago. The staff were friendly and the food portions were good. Unfortunately the food itself was disappointing. I ordered the Jerk Chicken meal. The rice and peas were dry and the jerk chicken bland. The jerk sauce was bland and seemed watered down. Even my buddy who tried it agreed. I usually do not waste food eat everything but this time I actually left half the food on the plate; both the rice n peas and chicken. Maybe it was a friday night, their \"club\" night (The DJ was busy setting up his equipment and the \"dance floor\" when we were there) and for the expectant crowd food was secondary. But I am definitely in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"We ordered take out at least 3 times per month and it always delivers on its taste. Never disappointed. Love the friday evening girl that answer the phone. She is really nice. Great food always."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I Love the Pepper Wings!! Can't go wrong with the Special Chicken Chow Mein. Staff are friendly and atmosphere is comfortable. Worth the drive from downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and wasn't disappointed. Had the Jerk chicken lunch special for 6.99, which included a quarter chicken and a huge plate of rice and beans. Service was very friendly and polite and the food arrived in a reasonable time. The chicken was nice, flavourful without being too hot.   Don't let the outside appearance of the place put you off."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for their lunch specials especially their goat curry, lo mein noodles with fried chicken and their fried rice. Their chicken wing s are also delicious. The last time I was there, I did notice they underwent a massive renovation so it's better lit and seating is spacious. Service was a bit slow but that was because the wait staff was new."}
{"text":"Had their shrimp wonton soup today, with extra peppa sauce and it was delicious! Definitely want more tm!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night. There was no cover charge, and it's a biggish space. The music was great, good dancehall and soca. But ppl didn't really start dancing til 1am..and then it closed by 2:30am..not my cup of tea. I had chicken lo mein..and that was a ridiculously large heap of food, good for 2 or 3 ppl. next time i'll try their spicy chicken."}
