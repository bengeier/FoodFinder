{"text":"The good:
- customer service (very accommodating since we wanted to switch seats due to  draft of air flowing through the restaurant because it was freezing that day)
- no issues using TeamBuy voucher. They did add the tip but I gave them extra for being so friendly
- good food (low sodium soy sauce available, all meats were cooked properly, soups were not authentic but they did not taste like they were old or instant, fried rice was tasty yet not salty and finally sushi rolls were great)
- decent presentation and plating
- the crispy items were seriously crispy (a+)
- good green tea!

The bad:
- no space, felt claustrophobic, they need to expand their space or change the arrangement
- cold, heater was weak
- closed early at 10
- moderate to limited selection
- too much avocado on some rolls
- slow service at times (felt like I was being paced)"}
{"text":"I went there last night and the food was pretty good. It was better than I'd expected due to all of the negative reviews. What was terrible was the service. Only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant!!! It was next to impossible to get her attention. I was so frustrated after asking 3 times for water and napkins that I went up to the front and poured my own water and got my own napkins. I also had to personally hand in my order sheet to the cooks since the poor waitress was completely run off her feet. This is the second time that I've been there where there is only one waitress working. Both times the restaurant was packed. I really don't understand why they won't hire more staff since  this practice will only deter customers from returning. Also some of the pics posted look nothing like the food served."}
{"text":"WOW!

By far the best sushi in Woodbridge....  Comparable to the best in Toronto.  Very creative, really fresh sashimi and super customer service."}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials always fresh made food and clean tables with free green tea! Love their fried banana ice cream and sushi pizza I ordered it with salmon and half spicy half non!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here at Toki Sushi for someone's birthday. Prior to that, I'd ate here one other time. The restaurant was not that busy, when we went there, a weekday evening. I'd say that there were two or three other tables. There was one waitress who helped everyone. We had AYCE and the selection of items was pretty good. And the service was okay, as the waitress did often come buy to refill drinks. 

However, the decor is pretty lackluster. And the sashimi we ordered was literally frozen in that there was still ice on it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 star, I would. 

I bought 2 of the deals for $22 for $44 worth of AYCE Sushi. I gave the other one to my friend. The deal expired on Dec 24 so I tried to call Dec 23, but the phone was OFF. Like another Yelper, my phone wouldn't go through. I went there anyway to see if we could go, the lady asked if we made any reservations. I explained to her about the phone situation. She was very rude, said they couldn't accommodate and walked away before we could say anything. She, and the rest of the staff, avoided eye contact. 

I forgot to mention, the place was not busy. There were still 4 tables unavailable when we got there. 

I am not coming here again. I'm extremely disappointed with the service I thought was only gossip. No business is to become successful when the clients and prospects have negative experiences."}
{"text":"Not too happy. Sashimi was OK, the soy sauce was too salty most other locations have the less sodium  version.  The teriyaki chicken is aged so it was not tender, same for beef. California and other rolls were just as good as our home made. Services were fast. Overall we were not happy because kids prices were to high and this is with team buy voucher buy one get one free. We prefer Masa in brampton and Vaughan area."}
{"text":"To begin with this is my first review ever.
We purchased a dealfind coupon and made it to this place for a weekday dinner.
Although the place was pretty much empty ( and I say that because it was only two of us sitting there) the service was VERY slow. All we ordered was sushi/maki and sashimi, no cooked items. Sashimi tasted ok, but sushi/maki had the rice slightly undercooked. 
The rolls were pretty small and the selection for the AYCE dinner was the poorest I've ever seen (maybe they have a 'special' menu for coupon holders, not sure here).
At the end they added a 10% tip as a compulsory charge to the bill. No other options left but to pay for their laziness became mandatory.
Not returning even if in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Toki with a group coupon, so it was half price. Even at that, it was barely worth it.  Service was poor from the first phone call.  Called to make a 6 pm reservation, they said 6:30. We arrive at 6:15, and the place is empty, except for 2 tables.
I think this restaurant used to be some type of a fastfood bar or burger joint.  Decor is rundown.  Washroom flush handle did not work.
The wooden table tops were sticky, even after they were wiped off.
Service was slow, though it was quiet.  Had to wave the menu and call server over to take the AYCE menu, each time.
Menu choices were very limited for AYCE.  Very basic. Tempura, oil must not have been hot enough, soggy and did not use panko bread crumbs.  The rolls were meh and the sashimi was just bare-able.
My friend did not even order a second round.  
I did not feel it was worth it, even at half price.
I think the positive reviews are bogus.  Service was not rude by any means, but slow and seemingly unconcerned. It did get busier towards the end of our meal.
I would not go back and would tell others to stay away, save your $.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. 
It can definitely get crowded and busy on Fridays and Weekends, so the service isn't great. I usually go on a weekday and it's much better in terms of service. With that said, the sushi is always good and yummy. Love their creative rolls."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in my life. I made reservations by 7. By the time I got there, they had no seats and told me they seated people by who came first. What's the point of making reservations if I'm not going to get seated around that time? Anyways. Had to wait an hour because their restaurant is so small and there were so many people still eating. Maybe they should have thought about it before making it an ayce place when it can barely fit a family in there.  Anyways by the time we sat down and ordered they came out with my miso soup.. Cold. I asked them for a new one and they told me that's how they serve their soup.. Next up, sushi. Ordered a couple items and they brought out only 1 roll that I've ordered. By then I was already getting impatient and annoyed so we ended up trying to wrap things up by ordering the deep fried banana and a couple of ice creams for 2 people. They put most of the ice creams into the same plate as the deep fried banana which we didn't want because it made the banana soggy and the ice cream was all melted. We also had a groupon offer that was 2 for $22, they added extra charges and we ended up paying $35 for two people. They even had the audacity to include 15% tip into the bill. Service was shit, restaurant was shit. Never coming back again. Nor do I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"For all you can eat sushi, this is place is \"ok\". Nothing special. All of the rolls that they offer have the same ingredients. They all taste the same. We went on a Friday night, it was extremely busy. We made reservations, but it wouldn't make a difference even if we didn't. This place is small, and most people came cause of their coupon deal that they bought. We waited for 30 minutes to get our table. Their service was very slow, we sat down and waited for 15 minutes after we ordered to get our food. Their sashimi doesn't taste very fresh. We ate for an hour and ten minutes, but they took forever to give us our food. We wanted to get another paper to order, but they gave us our bill instead without asking if we finished or not yet because there were other people waiting. 
They also have very little selections for their food. 
I will not return."}
{"text":"Great food and presentation. Sashimi is fresh and salmon teriyaki is juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Prices are very reasonable. A very nice and clean restaurant. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I came here with a groupon. When I saw the first 2 reviews and the accompanying pictures, I was pretty thrilled. Those pictures look pretty good. Something must have happened between those two 5 star reviews and now because this place is below average for a sushi AYCE. 

This place is very obviously understaffed. There are 3 people serving the entire restaurant. One sushi chef, one kitchen guy, one waitress. They all must be very overworked. It took too long to get us the menu and our drinks. I saw other people walk in feeling frustrated not being attended to, and eventually left. That one waitress is simply too busy to serve everyone. This is really poor management. You can hire someone at minimum wage to work just the evening shift. That's like what? Under $60 a night? $60 to improve the experience of all the customers that come seems like a bargain to me, especially when you consider that people with bad experiences will never come back. Overall, our orders took too long to arrive. 

The food itself wasn't bad, but it's definitely subpar for the most part and average at best. The biggest strike against this place (aside from service) is the limited selection of sashimi. It's just salmon, white tuna, and red snapper. I don't count imitation crab as sashimi. The sashimi quality was acceptable. They don't have any rolls that you can't get elsewhere. The dynamite roll tasted just like a dragon roll. The seafood fried rice and seafood udon were disappointing. They might have been called vegetable fried rice/fried udon instead because they barely contained any seafood. The beef teriyaki was very good. The sushi had slightly more rice than I'd like but it's not the worst I've seen. Aside from these, everything else was just ok. 

I don't recommend this place unless you're in the area and insist on getting sushi. If you want to get stuffed on mediocre food, there's a McDonalds in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of a deal. It's a little hard to spot.  The food was average... Good but not great.  We had 4 salmon rolls... Not maki style... The smaller ones... 2 eel rolls again the smaller variety. A spicy maki style roll with salmon, shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber. And a couple other specialty rolls.  No surprises... The fish seemed fresh but I'm comparing to the awful all you can eat places that don't use sushi grade fish.  After those meal my stomach doesn't feel so good.

Would love to try a proper sushi place where the chef has apprenticed and done the proper 10yrs or so needed to see what I'm missing."}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly. Never once did my glass of water or tea reach half way which was nice. Our server was extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we asked for.
The food was decent for all you can eat. I've had better and I've had worse. I found some things bland.
I didn't particularly enjoy their soba noodles or spicy salmon (it was quite onion-ey). I liked the salmon avacodo rolls but the salmon was cut a little weird. 
I would probably visit again if I was in the area.
They had some lunch deals that seemed like a good value but it's a bit out of my way."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for their dinner ayce. It was pretty spontaneous the evening I went. I called an hour beforehand and they said they had seats roughly 40mins later. We drove from Mississauga so it was perfect timing. 
When I got there, I bumped into a friend who said the restaurant was not bad and everything was good and fresh- I was excited since I really enjoy Japanese food. I was looking forward to be seated since the server said it would be a few minutes....the next thing I knew.. my brother and I waited for 30+ mins to be seated. 

The server mislead us on the phone as well as when we got there. The cherry on top was when there were 2 tables leaving... She let the 2 people that came after us  pick which table they wanted... Seriously! I was not happy...

Tho the food was not bad and the hot items were freshly made...I highly doubt I will be back again."}
{"text":"Wow, so many bad reviews? This one's coming from someone who regularly does AYCE Sushi... and I really liked Toki. Sure, I don't think I'd come out this far for a AYCE sushi dinner priced at $22.95, but the TeamBuy deal was worth it. Also, in terms of food and service, it beat Hockey Sushi... and even Kyoto Sushi in Downtown. For all the negative reviews this place has received, I am going to do a super detailed review that covers everything. 

The Restaurant: 
It's a small place located in a strip mall off Highway 7. Nothing special from the outside and not so much the inside either. The place can probably fit 4 large groups of 6-8 people and 4 small groups of 2-4 people. And it's tight. Having said that, it wasn't unclean; and the tables weren't sticky. They need to work on their heating system.

Menu: 
I've put up a picture of the AYCE menu. It's not as limited as it's made out to be in some of these reviews; although, I will agree that I've seen more variety in AYCE dinner menus. Also, I usually end up ordering the same few things everywhere - salmon, tuna, dragon rolls, something with a little bit of avocado, shrimp tempura, miso soups, salads - so, I wasn't disappointed. They had all of that. 

Food: 
They serve white ginger (non-colored)!! The sushi was good as were the rolls, sashimi and all the appetizers we ordered. Also, everything was presented beautifully. We ordered quite a bit - miso soups, seaweed salad, teriyaki appetizers, chicken katsu, gyoza, calamari, shrimp tempura, salmon sashimi, spicy sashimi (salmon and tuna), spicy handroll, rainbow roll, Philadelphia roll, salmon avocado roll, sushi pizza, edamame, and ice cream for dessert. My Dad loved the spicy sashimi and we were surprised (given the reviews), that nothing was bad or unfresh. The few things that stood out in the yumminess factor: 
- Salmon Sushi Pizza 
- Beef Teriyaki (perfect medium rare)
- Sashimi Salad

Service: 
Our server didn't speak a lot of English, but was really nice and courteous. Also, the way he handled the couple seated on a table close to ours, was undeservingly (for them) polite. This calls for Anecdote time!!

Anecdote: 
A couple walked in with a Teambuy coupon. The server politely let them know that their coupon had already been redeemed. I am not sure what they had in mind, but the woman started up quite the fight... and then, she asked if she could use the server's phone to find another coupon in her email. Astoundingly baffling! The server wasn't phased; he merely brought them the iPad he was using to scan the Teambuy deals. The woman, then, spent 10 minutes looking through her e-mail... and surprise surprise. No coupon! The man (in the relationship...heh!) stepped in. He wanted to check if the deal was still on on Teambuy. So, he asked for the iPad again (despite of the server's explanation that the deal was no longer on) and browsed for 20 minutes. No luck. I was almost sure that they would walk out. But the guy ordered. The woman said she's going out to look for food (what a weirdo!) but then she came back in after a few minutes and ate. I couldn't believe that these things actually happen! If I was the server, I'd have broken a limb (and not my own). 

Additional Note: Taxes and tips added up for me. I wasn't scammed. 

I hope this review is helpful. I was scared to give Toki a shot... but I am glad I did."}
{"text":"My fellow groupon buyers - please beware of this place. (1) limited selection - only...comparing this to other ayce japanese this place sucks for the money you pay for...quite a few things we ordered never came...this place is tiny as hell for an ayce and also the sashimi selection is only 4 different types and speciality rolls were only 6 but to me they all looked and tasted the same...you will not get get the rolls or dessert seen in the pictures...this place is a scam when it comes to getting your bill...I had the groupon deal $22 for 2 people which is originally $45...they charged me a lunch ayce price for taxes and tip at $12.99 PLUS tax on top of that which came out to $13.15...the taxes and tip don't add up at all.....SCAM SCAM SCAM....I hope this place gets audited and closes down"}
{"text":"I have no idea how the food is as I have never made it here. I bought a voucher on Teambuy after reading pretty good reviews about their food.

I have been calling for several weeks to make a reservation; unfortunately, I have NEVER gotten through until the DAY BEFORE it expires. The lady who answered the phone was VERY rude, and asked why I waited until today to call when I knew it was busy; I explained to her that I have been trying to call, and she ignored my comment. She told me that they were full today and tomorrow they could only accommodate me at lunch, however when I told her that I could not get there as I work quite far away, she asked me what I expected her to do about it.

I then asked to confirm that the original value of the voucher paid would be honoured, and she again yelled at me for calling so last minute, and said no, repeating \"well what do you want me to do about it, you should know it would be busy\"

Never even walked into the restaurant; really don't plan to."}
