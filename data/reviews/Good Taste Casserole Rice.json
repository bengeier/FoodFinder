{"text":"One of my go to spots in Markham. For 10 dollars, you get a soup, vege and the most delicious rice casserole in all of Markham (and possibly GTA, just saying).

 If you are not familiar, these rice casseroles are like a cantonese version of hot stone bibimbap. You gotta let the bottom and side layers of the rice get nice and crispy. I don't like eating rice at all and I really enjoy this place. Get the preserved meat and chicken. YUMZ. And the shrimp rice roll!"}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant gives you a good chuckle but the food is really good!

We ordered the four treasures and preserved meat with eel casseroles, which comes with soup and veggies on the side. They cook per order so it took about 20-30 minutes for our food to come, but they did serve us the soup while we waited. The soup was very sweet and \"clear\" as they claim to not add any salt to it. The casseroles were delicious with plenty of flavour, but make sure you portion your toppings as you eat the rice! Otherwise you'll just be left with plain rice, which actually isn't bad on its own - crispy rice with a dash of soy sauce? Yum! 

The restaurant is quite small and seats fill up quick during peak meal times. Be warned that this is definitely not a quick meal and you should be prepared to wait for your food. I would definitely come back and try their other casseroles because the quality and value here can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Food - By looking at the photos, it seemed mediocore, just like a typical average Joe. However, due to good reviews on Yelp, decided to make a drive there to try.

Environment - I waited for 15 minutes at the door. The place looks small and overloaded with limited seat capacity, definitely not accessible friendly if anyone with a wheelchair or walker, for sure can't walk in. Not sure if the small space is Safety and Hazard approved by the city? People sitting furthest from the main entrance won't be able to run out in time in the event of quick evacuation.

Service - Poor. Horrible. None. So from the moment I walked in, I was not greeted, a lady just handed me a paper menu. I then greeted the waitress and kindly requested for seats by the wall, instead of the seats in the middle of the crowded hallway (since a senior will be present). I purposely went a little earlier so the elderly don't have to stand and wait around to wait for a spot. The waitress told me all tables  by the walls were full. I said I would wait. Minutes later, the same waitress told me to take a seat first at the seats in the middle of the hallway.

 So, I followed their instructions and waited. 3 minutes later, a party of 2 came in and coincidently, a table by the wall was about to free up as the people from that table started getting up. I then kindly asked the waitress if I can move to that table.

Unbelievably, the second waitress said, \"No, you are not moving to that table, you sat down at the seat you are in already, you can't move.\" I then kindly questioned her, \"But the first waitress told me to sit here first to wait for a table by the wall? (again, I wanted the table by the wall because an elderly is about to arrive, and I wanted her to have more space, instead of being crowded in the middle of the \"hallway\").  The second waitress answered, \"No, you either don't sit down, if you sit down, you can't move.\" I then said, \"But, I was only taking the instruction from the first waitress to sit here first while I wait?? I requested a table that I couldn't get, now someone comes in, and they can sit there even if they didn't specifically ask for a table by the wall?\" The second waitress continued to answer me by, \"No, no moving!\" The customers who came in after me actually asked \"So, should we sit down? Or, no?\" The second waitress continue to say, \"Don't give the table away, no one is moving, you can sit down.\" I just looked so puzzled. 
1. I went in to request for a table by the wall
2. The first waitress asked me to sit and wait for one, I took the instruction.
3. When there was a free table, the second waitress won't let me sit there
4. The first waitress didn't back me up by confirming her own instructions.

I just got up and left. We later went to Bowl Kee Restaurant at the same Plaza. Seriously, Bowl Kee was much more spacious (especially for seniors) and friendly, the moment we stepped in. 

Overall - Not recommended. Why go to a place that's rude and disrespectful? Not like the food and environment is above par that it could compensate for the extremely horrible service."}
{"text":"Great value. I came here on Sunday night at around 6pm and it was packed. Its a hole in the wall restaurant so you're expected to eat and leave after. There was a long wait but the door. Be sure to get a number and keep an eye out when it's your turn for a table. 

Food:
Great value for the amount of food in the combos: around $9 and you get small soup, casserole rice dish and plate of fresh vegetables. Soup was bland but it was traditional Chinese herb soup made in the individual ceramic pots that was salt free and no msg. Theres a good selection the rice casseroles and they taste okay.  Could have been better with more flavour and toppings. Portion size is huge but mostly rice and not much toppings.  Its authentic with the crispy rice bottom. 

Atmosphere:
No atmosphere, . The food comes out freshly made to order and hot but service is lacking. You have to follow up on your soup and veggies."}
{"text":"The decor may be plain, but the food is AMAZING!  We had #23 octopus & scallop & #38 chicken & mushroom.  Both had a light taste of ginger.  They marinated the chicken and mushroom and that's the reason it tasted sooooooo good.  The chicken pieces were very tender and juicy.  The octopus pieces and dry scallop were light but tasteful.  Both orders came with soup and small plate of vegetables.  Good deal for the money, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Small place, roughly 10 tables or so. Tucked away in a busy plaza in Markham, with tons of other Chinese restaurants. Found this place on Yelp, so I'm paying my dues. Waitresses speak NO english, so I had to point to pictures on the menu for my order. They were very friendly tho... Ordered #5 \"Four Treasures Rice\" (preserved meat, preserved duck, eel, and BBQ Pork). 

Be prepared to wait 20 minutes, everything is made to order. Menu advertises that dishes come with soup, vegetables, and choice of coke/sprite, however I when I mentioned the drink, the server looked clueless. My soup never arrived, I had to mention it, but it apologetically arrived later.

Great comfort food, piping hot! I will check this place out again in the Winter if I'm in the area.

3/5"}
{"text":"Great price and yummy pot rice, $10 comes with soup and veggie side dish. The soy sauce is on point. Been back a few times already."}

Rating: (10/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (7/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

A hidden gem in Markham, this is the GO TO spot for Casserole. Essentially it's a stone pot rice dish, with different toppings and soy sauce. Toppings range from preserved meat to chicken and pork. The dishes are cooked fresh, so it does take a bit of time to cook (don't come here for a quick bite!). 

On top of the casserole, the rice rolls are fantastic. Arguably one of the best, as they make it super fresh with the right texture and thickness. Didn't expect this to really stand out as much as it did!

The actual restaurant space if very simple with a family owned vibe. The seating is comfortable, but nothing to sing home about. Has a small hole-in-the-wall vibe, but everything is very clean and the service is good. 

Although there are a few other options in the area, this one has the best value, taste and quality of all the other spots that we've tried."}
{"text":"Dont expect too much with thus place, service is worst than the soup kitchen. Food is good cook well simple and have a a lot of varieties. They only accept cash and they also expect to be tipped even with poor service"}
{"text":"We came to this place as a large group upon recommendation. It was the first time I had to preorder an entire meal for the table in advance. Each rice pot takes 45 minutes to cook, ALSO having to wait for a table. We reserved a table, also ordered via phone, with an estimated time we will arrive.

Was it good? I was impressed with the amount of ingredients on top of the rice.  The spread of item was very sufficient, good ratio of ingredients to rice.  It was a plus to have Chinese vegetables on side, and a bowl of soup.

Good price for the meal.  This is meant as a super casual ambiance.  Don't dress too nice, or bring stuff where you need space to put it down. This establishment is a shoulder-to-shoulder type of seating area.

I would come back with ample of advance notice"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Great little place for claypot rice with many combinations of meats and vegetables to choose from. The rice is cooked perfectly with the right texture where you can see and feel each individual grain as oppose to lumps of rice that stick together.

They also include soup options as a combo which are made with ingredients that have various health benefits, making you feel very comforting.

If you don't feel like waiting 20 minutes for it, you can call them to make it beforehand so that it's ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"This is a family owned business serving clay pot rice and Chinese rice rolls. Portion size is very filling. Lots of variety of preserved meat and different toppings. Clay pot rice comes with soup and blanched vegetables. There is a bit of wait as rice is made to order. I order 4 treasure preserved meats with eel and preserved meats with dried scallop and shrimp"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for Chinese casserole rice aka clay pot rice in Markham. The place is located in Peach Tree Centre in Markham and can get really busy on weekend evenings. We came here around 7pm on Saturday and waited for around 15 mins for a table. I'd recommend taking a look at their menu and order the casserole rice while waiting for your table because each rice takes around 15-20 minutes to cook. We ordered two casserole rice, one with shrimp, egg and preserved sausage and another with chicken and preserved meat. Each rice costs around $10 and comes with a plate of veggies and a small pot of soup. I enjoyed the chicken clay pot rice a lot as the rice was full of strong chicken flavour. Great value and a satisfying filling meal. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 -- Value: 10/10 -- Service: 5/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10

The food here is really great. Perfect for colder weather because the stone bowls keep the food nice and hot and after a few bites, you warm right up. There's an option to pay more and upsize your bowl, which we've done a few times. However, we never know which of the bowls has been upsized, so I'm hesitant to say it's a worthwhile difference. 

The soup that comes with each order is tasteless, so I always pass on it.

YOU MUST CALL AHEAD. 

The service speed is atrocious. Absolutely horrible. In the five or so times I've been there, it has been criminally understaffed every time. Only one waitress and one person working in the kitchen. We call to order ahead of time and get seated before other people because we have food on the way. Last time we did that, we sat, got our food, and watched as tables who had been seated before us waited over 45 minutes for their food. We'd finished eating and paid the bill just as they'd gotten their food. 

SO CALLING AHEAD IS A MUST.

The owners need to be less cheap and hire more people. The waitress is always incredibly overwhelmed and understandably so. But the classic Chinese food is great."}
{"text":"After passing by this little joint for over a year,  my husband and I finally stepped inside to try some casserole rice.

*The one reason why we never tried it out was because of its name.  We've been to restaurants that boast their 'good taste', and it pretty much guarantees one thing: a date with the toilet bowl after dinner.

However, after reading all the great reviews on Yelp about this restaurant, I was sold!  I love the set meals they have.  I got a salted fish with pork ribs and my husband got the pork ribs with black bean.  The rice was soft, but not overly cooked; it was infused with the meat.  After the meal, we still had leftover rice.  

The only complaint I had was a) the wait is long.......  So if possible I heard you can call ahead to pre-order.  b) There wasn't enough time or perhaps heat to make the rice crispy on the side of the hot pot.  I love it when the rice is so crispy it becomes a crispy light brown with lots of crunch.

The homemade soup came out in a little pot. The waitress advised us there was no salt in the soup, so you can add your own.  +1 on no MSG or excessive salt in the soup.

Price/Value for the meal is very reasonable.  It's cheaper than eating at the neighbouring HK cafe for a set dinner and a lot healthier.  I'll be back to try their famous rice rolls as they had sold out that evening."}
{"text":"Here they specialize in one thing: Cantonese casserole rice. The raw long grain rice is cooked in an earthenware pot for nearly 20 minutes. This special cooking method helps to bring out the fragrant properties of the rice, which clearly defines itself from the more conventional rice making processes. There is a large selection of meat toppings available on the rice. I opted for the unagi (eel) and Chinese sausages. The flavours of the meats really sink into the rice through the cooking process. The service was good (excellent relative to Markham's Asian restaurant standards) and each rice dish comes with your choice of a soft drink or soup. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for more than 20 years and my oh my, this place makes the best casserole rice!! My foremost disclaimer is that it's not the *cheapest* price you can get it for but C'MON, let's talk about the quality here - as a specialty store, it really doesn't get better than this when critiquing reliability, flavour, and temperature. You can ALWAYS expect the rice to be cooked at the perfect temperature and for the perfect duration to get that steaming hot casserole that has only a slight crisp burnt to its edges. Not overly burnt, not undercooked, but just right. 

Both the chicken and pork ribs that I've tried were juicy and tender and not to mention, infused with aromatic and savoury flavours. The complimentary soup is a bit bland by nature, but you're supposed to add a bit of salt yourself to really draw out the flavours. The vegetable side dish is a nice way to get your veggie intake for the meal and is only lightly seasoned, perfect since the casserole is flavourful enough as is. 

I would highly recommend you check this place out! (But beware on hot days, they don't have air conditioning and only use fans!)"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my group of friends last night. Luckily we called in ahead to order the food so we don't have to wait for the food too long. Came in around 8:45pm ish and waiting for the seats wasn't too long either. By the time we sat down, our food finally came! Everything tasted delicious but sometime still need to add little bit of soy sauce for flavoring. I definitely would come back and order the curry chicken rice again."}
{"text":"Casserole rice/clay pot rice is a staple comfort food for the Cantonese. Although the restaurant itself is small with limited seats, the amount of food you get for around 8-15 dollars is completely worth the wait. Be prepared to wait out the door on the weekend (sometimes even on weekdays) during dinner hours , as they do not take reservations. The service style at this restaurant is very traditional - the waitress gives you a small sheet of paper and their menu to write down your order number. 

The menu itself has a LOT of topping options. I've never been unsatisfied with any of my selections. You can order additional toppings such as a raw egg or more meats at an extra cost. 

If you order a casserole rice, it comes with a portion of fresh veggies and a nice hearty unsalted soup that you can salt to your liking. The portion of the casserole rice is decent - probably around 3-5 portions of a standard Chinese rice bowl. For those who do not know what a casserole rice is, they essentially cook the rice and whatever toppings you choose in a hot clay pot. The topping gives the rice all the flavour and aromas, and the clay pot crisps some of the rice to give it extra flavours and textures.

If you do not like waiting, ordering take out from them is just as good. They cook their casserole rice in the aluminum take out bowl, and it still achieves the same quality and taste. The food inside still remains very hot (to the point where it cooks a cracked raw egg), even after 20 minutes.

Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"If you are craving the perfect casserole rice dish (\"Bo Jai Fan\") then this is the place to go! The rice has perfect crunch on the crust and the flavors are sooooo authentic. Plus they come with free soup and veggie!! I do suggest calling ahead to order to avoid a long wait at the restaurant. Service is simple yet friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I love their rice noodles! Their clay pot rice is also quite good and authentic. It's actually cooked in the clay pot and not reheated; you can tell because of the crispy rice at the bottom. 
The inside is super small and there's not much decor but the food is what really shines at this place. You should definitely call ahead and order because wait times can be long and there's very limited seating in the restaurant. I was lucky that the two times I have been here, I did not have to wait for a table. Also, the clay pot rice comes in a very big portion (to me, at least) and it is best shared between two people. The clay pot rice comes with soup or soda (I think) and a side of veggies. 
Service can be slow but it's honestly nothing to complain about because there's only 1 server working (i saw 2 servers the last time I went but it still feels super understaffed to me) so you just have to be patient. 

Overall, this place is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The casserole rice is good, but it takes reallyyyyy long for it to come, so don't come here if you don't have time to wait. The food here tastes homemade and genuine, with lots of love put into it. However don't expect much of an atmosphere as it is more of a hole-in-the-wall type restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Their rice crust is crispy and delicious. Rice noodles are soft and freshly made. 

Service can be intimidating as they don't speak much English, and they shout a bit. It's just the Chinese style of service, the ladies are actually really friendly. 

It's my go-to winter food!"}
{"text":"I give 3.5 star for this restaurant. The service is very friendly and the rice are very good. The table in the middle ate too close to each other which it has no privacy to chat. We order 3 casserole and one of them was sticky rice. The rice has too much oil. The other 2 was pretty good. I would come again if I'm near by for some casserole again"}
{"text":"Man this place is good. Yesterday was our first time here because I had a craving for clay pot rice. The line up was crazy and it's understandable. The food and service is good but the restaurant is very small and limited seating. However the fact that people would wait 30 mins for a seat is because it is worth it! The good thing is they take your order and start preparing your clay pot while you wait so that when you sit down the food will be ready. For $10-12 you get a hearty bowl of rice with toppings, veggies and a Chinese soup. It feels like I travelled back in time. The food is not flavourful as it is not covered in salt and msg which is the way food should taste anyways. We ordered the minced meat with salted egg which was delicious. The crispy rice at the bottom of the pot was so yummy. Not all places cook this traditionally anymore. We also ordered a preserved meat with cha siew which was also delicious. Next time I will try the five treasure rice."}
{"text":"Food
Soup - contains a few ingredients and but It is borderline tasteless. 
Vege - boiled. Still maintained its texture. Good. 
Four Treasure Rice - comes out steaming hot. Eel is pretty good and tastes the same as what you would find at Japanese restaurants (as a comparison). You also get preserved sausage and preserved duck sausage slices. BBQ pork is thinly sliced. I wish there was more toppings to go with the amount of rice. It's otherwise a good pot of rice. 

Restaurant
small, tight seatings. Not the cleanest either. Nothing exciting inside so you pretty much just dine and leave. 

Service
if they smiled and looked you in the eye, you're a winner. Basically, expect bare minimum and that's it.


Overall, nothing here will blow your mind. You'll just have a good bowl of clay pot rice and nothing more."}
{"text":"This place only does one type of dish and it does it SO well!  Every chance I get to come here, I don't hesitate. We got here bright and early that day, literally right when the restaurant opened at 11AM. Note: for their winter hours, they open at 11AM now rather then the normal time of 10AM.

It was a pretty cold morning in the city so this meal was very welcome.  We started with an ordering some of their freshly made rice noodle rolls.  I got the beef noodle roll and it was pretty great along with the slightly sweet soy sauce.  The menu is vast here but I ultimately settled on one of their really popular items which is the preserved meat dried shrimps, and scallops with rice.  The most popular dish is the same ingredients but with the sticky rice instead.  For just $1.50 more, you can get a soup and vegetable green side which is a great way to complement the meal.

The first thing I did when I opened the casserole pot is to pour some of that soy sauce over the rice and let it continue cooking for a few more minutes.  Let the rice get all crispy at the bottom while the soy sauce just permeates the rest of the dish.  It really smelled delicious.

I didn't end up leaving any left in the casserole bowl after the meal.  The rice was so flavourful from the saltiness of the dried shrimp, the seafood flavour from the scallops, and the drippings from the thinly sliced preserved meat.  

This place didn't disappoint and I'm already thinking about when I can go back the next time."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of rice and casseroles so I might be a but biased here but this place is awesome if you're just craving a simple and traditional Chinese rice dish. 

There's plenty of options here but the downside is that most of the items are similar. Preserved meats is a common theme here but that's how it's done. All rice meals come with bok choy and your choice of soup or pop. The soup I had was a simple one containing random pork bone parts, carrots, and corn. A very traditional soup. The most interesting tidbit was that it tasted 'clean', virtually salt and MSG free. 

For the rice meal, I went with the four treasures rice - the four 'treasures' being preserved sausage, preserved duck, bbq pork, and eel. Initially I thought there was a lot of rice and not too much 'toppings' but I ended up partitioning everything down to the last bite. If you hate carbs then you won't like the ratio, but I thought it was fine. The rice did have a sweet soy sauce, but could have used a a tad more. The rice at the bottom of the casserole dish was sticky and had a nutty crispiness to it.  

They ONLY take cash here so make sure you bring some money with you."}
{"text":"My new favourite place to go to for rice noodles or \"cheung fun\" :) so soft, chewy and delightful to eat! My friend and I tried their beef cheung fun, but will definitely be back for others. My only complaint is that the place is tiny.. But I guess you'll just have to try your luck with seating!"}
{"text":"Seating is very limited here, so make sure you come early enough!!! This is your traditional, good quality \"bo jai fan\", or clay pot rice. The best part about this is that they cook the clay pot rice long enough for the rice to be crunchy or, \"fan jiu\". Each order of rice comes with a soup and a side dish of vegetable, giving you that \"balanced diet\". 

Overall, was impressed by the flavour of the rice pots. But the steamed rice roll was not very good so avoid at all cost.

I would come back again but the food is fairly oily so eaters beware."}
{"text":"Interesting family run hot pot rice casserole personal size. Lots of toppings to choose from for the rice and it's like a combo with soup and vegetables.  Price between  $7.99 to $10.99. Got the beef and egg it was  superb if you like rice steaming hot this is for you. Keep in mind it's made to order so takes a bit longer to arrive."}
{"text":"Good comfort Chinese food. If you like hot pot rice, this is the nbr IT place to go!!!  Don't confused this place with the other pot rice place in the same plaza. 

This place is so busy during lunch and dinner time tha some people call in to preorder in advance to make sure not to wait as long. Service can be a hit if it is super busy.  The price is good for what you get at this place. You get a rice dish, a soup or drink and a plate of veggies for about $10. Good comfort food at an affordable price. It is no wonder this place has always long wait time as it is small. However they are quick at turning tables. Also if you don't wanna wait , order takeout to go.

Rice noodles and Congees are available during the day. Sometimes if u get lucky, it may be still available in the evening but it is rare.

The soup is actually very watery. That is because it lacks elements in the soup and has too much water. If you want some taste, add some salt. 

The veggies: it varies between Choy sum and cabbage. 

Come early or end up waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Bo zi fan (clay pot rice) is a classic cantonese comfort dish, and I was really happy that this place was able to satisfy my bo zi fan craving. The rice at the bottom of the clay pot crisps up perfectly, and you can easily wedged it off of the bottom. The rice topping, although a bit sparse, was delicious. 

I like how each clay pot rice came with a small dish of bak choy, and carrot soup. The soup was extremely clean to the point that there was almost no taste. This can be both a good and bad thing. I definitely prefer it clean, as I can season it myself with as much salt as I need. 

We went for a late dinner (around 9), and the restaurant was still quite busy, so I can imagine that there will be a healthy lineup during peak dinner and lunch hours."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant is fitting. That is, the taste is good but not great. 

I ordered the preserved meat and ribs rice (bo zai fan) for $9.99 which is a casserole dish with a selection of preserved pork items and rice.  Scrape off the crispy parts of rice that got stuck to the bottom for some crunchy bites. The meal includes a side of steamed leafy greens (yu choy) and soup served in an old-style chinese cup with lid.  Instead of soup, you can get a can of pop. 

I noticed that many people called ahead of time to pre-order food, so that they can be seated and eat immediately when they arrive. I highly recommend you do this.

If you are looking for a meal that tastes home-cooked, try this place.  Otherwise, it is a \"good\" place to eat.

There's lots of free parking in this plaza's lot, though it gets extremely busy during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Good value... But I did find a long hair in my food which was really gross... And they didn't seem to care.. 

Anyway, we had the lap Cheung with rice and also the rice noodle rolls. these are made by hand just like in Hong Kong and they were pretty good. I did enjoy the rice noodles rolls.

the soy sauce they serve with the rolls and with the rice casseroles are heated/cooked and sweetened so it tastes delicious and traditional. 

I just wish they wore hairnets or were just a bit more sanitary. Hair in your food and lack of any care from the staff does not equal a great experience... Check your food guys!"}
{"text":"Quality casserole rice dishes at a fair price. They make everything without using any condiments or oil so its much healthier than most other chinese restaurants. My favourite however is the rice rolls. They make the rice rolls fresh using the scraping style that is common in street vendors in canton. The nostalgia it brings is too real."}
{"text":"One of the best Casserole Rice in town.  It is my comfort food esp during the winter time.  Their portion is prefect for one.  It comes with a soup & a small dish of vegetable.  Remember to add salt into your soup, as they don't add it for you.

Need to wait here... First, wait for a table... then ~30mins wait for your casserole rice after you've order it.  They make your dish right after you order it, so it's worth the wait.

My favourite dish is Octopus & Minced Pork Rice, and their Lap Ceung (Chinese Sausage) rice.  Their casserole rice's soy sauce is perfect match with the rice~!!

They also have the best Rice Noodle Roll, however, it's always sold out... Better to be there early if you really want to try their Rice Noodle Roll.

Take-out is another good option if you don't like the wait... Just remember to call them ahead for your take out order."}
{"text":"Walked by here a few times, but there weren't any customers.  Passed by again today and saw someone stepped out..... hmmmm........ why not give this new restaurant a try!  There was big red words written on the window \"congee and steamed rice noodle roll\".  Stepped in and asked for steamed rice noodle roll, but they were sold out.  The owner said they only served at breakfast and are of limited quality.  The only food they served are rice in hot pot and soup.  We had the salted fish with chicken rice.  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the salted fish added such a good favor.  We didn't have to add in any soy sauce.  There was a crust of scorched rice at the bottom, and it was crunchy and yummy!!  The soup was good and full of flavor and the server told us that the soup had been simmer for almost three hours and it wasn't boiled.  No wonder the soup was so clear and rich in flavor.  Having rice in hot pot and hot soup in a summer afternoon wasn't something that I would ever planned for, but this accidental encounter of HOT meal wasn't bad : )  One hot pot was good enough for two...... ohhh......... veggie was complimentary as well.  Good food, reasonable price and GREAT service!
** Just opened in May and more items will be adding to their menu **"}
{"text":"Rice: Had the spare ribs and the pork with raw egg pot rice. Tasted excellent (and since it comes with home made soup and plate of veggies, nutritious). Pork had good marinated flavor and once the egg was stirred in with the hot rice, cooked nicely by itself. Spare ribs was not my thing - it was too chewy - although the rice absorbed the meat flavor.

Unfortunately: Took away one star because when I saw a hair in the rice, the owner just said sorry without doing anything about it.

Tip: Order ahead even if you're going to wait in line for a table. The casserole rice takes about 30 minutes to cook because they make it after you order. Ordering ahead will make the wait for your food less painful."}
{"text":"Good Taste Casserole Rice is a new addition in Peachtree Plaza.  It is located where Harvest Restuarant used to be.  The menu comprises of only 2 big groups of items: casserole rice and soup.  I am not sure if the concept is unique, but it is definitely interesting.  I will be interested in seeing if this concept store will pick up steam.

I came for a late lunch.  I ordered a Five Treasures Rice, which was 2 types of Chinese pork sausages, dried BBQ pork, corn niblets, red carrots and peas on white rice, cooked in a casserole pot, of course ($9).  The dish looked quite pretty and colorful, and there were A LOT of pork bits in the pot (see pic).  The oil of the dried BBQ pork infused into the rice giving it a texture and a fragrance.  Without adding sweet soy sauce, the rice tasted delicate.  The sweet soy sauce added a bit of moisture and flavour, but I would be fine without the flavour because there were so many pork bits.  I am not sure if it was due to new opening, but there was a complimentary small soup and a boiled lettuce accompanying the rice order.  This was nice.

I was the only customer during my visit, so the services was unquestionably attentive and quick.  The interior decor is no frills; so don't expect much.  Portion wise will is lunch size.  I am not sure a hungry man will find it sufficient.

10% off during grand opening."}
{"text":"Very very average. Quite disappointed that this was rated 4 stars on Yelp since that made me choose this restaurant over Big Beef Bowl which is in the same plaza. We ordered the shrimp rice noodle roll. This was quite odd since the shrimp came on top of the roll instead of inside it. We also got the four treasures casserole and the octopus with minced pork casserole. This came with a very bland corn herbal soup which was in need of salt. The tour treasures casserole hardly had any toppings for the amount of rice they give. Also the rice didn't seem to have the infused flavor from the lap cheong etc. so I feel like they have all the rice and then just add the toppings on. The octopus minced pork was a little better. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"One cold night, we decided to have some hot pot rice.  So we came here as we were told they make some good hot pot price.  When we first walked in.  It was packed with people.  Basically there's really no room to stand.  We waited for well over 25 mins and we end up getting a seat.  The place is relatively small and limited seats.  But their hot pot rice is good so people are willing to wait no matter what.  We ordered mince  meat with octopus hot pot rice and my wife ordered chicken hot pot rice.  Both came with a vegetables and a soup.  The soup is very plain and not much flavour in it.  However the rice and the soya sauce that goes with it is great.  For those who are interested in hot pot rice should definitely come for a visit."}
{"text":"If you are a rice lover, definitely try this place out.

They have many combinations of clay pot rice. They are cooked to order (takes roughly 20mins to cook), so beware if you are in a rush. The rice are cooked just right with a little bit of crunchiness to it (the best part of the clay pot rice imo).  The toppings are not dry and chewy at all!! They are tender and juicy which go so well with the crisped rice at the bottom. They also give you a soup and a small plate of veggie on the side.  Not the best soup I must say, I can never finish the soup every time I go as they are rather bland. 

We also ordered the steamed rice roll. I was actually excited to try as they were always sold out by dinner time.  The steamed rice roll was rather dry and tasteless. Pretty disappointed, not going to order again. 

Definitely a good place to go if you are craving for clay pot rice !"}
{"text":"Many people in their reviews says the wait for the hot pot rice would take long so we started off our meal with congee and rice rolls. Once we got the soup which came with the hot pot rice, the wait didn't seem long at all.

The rice rolls were soft and freshly made but I have had smoother rice rolls before. We got shrimp rice roll which had a good amount of shrimp. These were prepared a little differently as they we just placed on top of the rice roll rather than being all wrapped up in the rice roll.

For the congee there is no options to choose from. They only have congee of the day. Tasted okay.

The hot pot rice is what they specialize in and it really was done well. The only complaint is that the chopped pork rib were really small chunks and had very little meat. Otherwise everything else was good. All hot pot rice comes with side of soup and veggies."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The pot rice is flavoured just right, and there's just enough rice sticking to the pot to give you the crunchiness that is a necessary part of the pot rice experience. 

But to get to the food, you need to accept that this is your strip mall hole in the wall. The walls are decorated with laminated posters of horses running... somewhere. Possibly away from the columns on the wall, which are a lovingly decorated with 80s-style wallpaper. The ambience is elevated by some ceiling decor that tries to  be hip in its faded blue glory, but is so out of step with the rest of the restaurant that it must be a holdover from a previous tenant. The tables are cramped. One table looks like the interior decorator ran out of space, and just gave up. 

The wait staff is super nice, but not super great about moving the ordering process along. Expect a wait, but partly because pot rice just takes that long to make. 

All of this should not deter you from going. The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"My my my yum! This place should be called: \"excellent taste and excellent value casserole\"!! We have been here several times now, and I cannot get enough of their rice pots. All of them are delicious, especially the spare ribs and pork with raw egg, best comfort food out there. Rice rolls are not pretty but good too. All the food is made like home cooking, so don't expect fancy looking dishes. This is a family business, everything is made from scratch, and using good ingredients, so be patient when ordering your food or call ahead. The place is small so again, call ahead, place your order, and you will have priority over walk-ins. It is a bit tucked away in the Peach Tree plaza make sure not to miss it!!!"}
{"text":"I have always meant to try this place and when my friend told me for $10, you get a casserole rice, a soup and a side of plain vege I was sold! I went on a weekday night at 8pm and the restaurant was packed!! We ordered 3 casserole rice: #15 preserved meat w/ chicken, #34 salted fish minced meat, (forgot number) preserved duck and pork ribs. We also ordered #52 rice roll w/ peanut, yam, carrot, bean, mushroom, preserved meat and dried shrimp. We add the sweet soy sauce on the table to all of the dishes as that's what you are supposed to do.

I really like the rice roll, it was just the right amount of flavour and the ingredients inside gave it really good texture. The preserved meat w/ chicken rice is probably the safest, it was good and the chicken was really tender and smooth! The preserved duck and pork ribs had really good flavours, I wouldn't mind ordering that again. Finally, the salted fish minced pork was good but the smell/ taste may not be for everyone, especially if you are not used to the variety in flavours used in Asian cuisine.

Overall, the meal is decent for the price. I will definitely be back for more rice rolls and casserole rice!"}
{"text":"One word: unacceptable. When my family entered the restaurant, the place was packed. We put in our orders for four \"bo jai faan\" and an order of rice rolls(cheung fun). We waited for over 45 minutes for our order! All the other tables got their orders except us. After waiting for 20 minutes, the waiter told us that there were no more rice rolls left but we saw other tables getting plates of rice rolls.

When our order finally came, the complimentary soup that came with the \"bo jai faan\" was diluted with water and had no taste. The \"bo jai faan\" didn't have a lot of ingredients and had no crunchy rice(\"faan jiu\"). I definitely will not go back again."}
{"text":"Happy with the experience. Place is nothing fancy. But the food serve is good.  We went in around 730pm on a sunday and the place is full. The staff are very friendly though they cannot speak or understand english very well.

Ordered the rice noodle roll and its freshly made. Beef and shrimp all taste really good. Casserole tice takes around 15 to 20 minutes to be ready, it comes with soup and vegetable. Orderd preserved meat with stiicky rice and steam pork with salted egg rice. Both are good. Will definitely vome back and try other items in the menu"}
{"text":"The rice absorbed the flavours from the mushroom and chicken. It was good! My favourite part of the dish is the thin crust of crispy rice at the bottom of the pot. Yum! Nicely crisped up rice on the bottom of the pot. We ordered two casserole dishes; Preserved meat and BBQ Eel on rice (Menu #4, $10.99 ) and chicken and mushroom on rice (Menu #38, $8.99)

Chicken and mushroom pot rice is pretty much a comfort food dish. It has the earthly flavour from the mushrooms, the soft and tender pieces of chicken, slivers of spicy ginger and lots of green onion. Everything tasted good but, I still added a few drops of soy sauce for extra flavour. It was chilly on Saturday recently (changing spring weather) and I had a feeling for a warming clay pot dinner and decided to check this place out. What a great one pot meal!

The order comes with a separate dish of dark green veggies and a container of piping hot soup. The soup was very simple     The dinner was comforting and was so satisfying to have the whole casserole pot to myself. No one to fight over the nice crispy rice at the bottom. The clay pot helps to keep the rice warm for extended period. The chicken and mushroom has nice flavour from all the other ingredients used to prepare the dish. 

The restaurant is outdated and not very pretty, service was straightforward and efficient. There is not much space in the restaurant to move around. People were seated closely together in the middle tables. Booth tables are definitely more spacious. We came around 7:45pm on Saturday and we did not have to wait at all (we came at a good time, based on past reviews sometimes there can be a wait for a table) Closer to 8:30pm - the line started forming close to the entrance. Great value overall!"}
{"text":"This is my go to winter Chinese comfort food. I give their food a 5, but any other areas of this place score a 2.5 at best.
Seating system is messy with long lineups all the time. Place smells funny when you walk in. Their service is also disorganized, things are missing or you order wouldn't be collected after you ask for a while. Servers are generally rude to younger patrons from what I noticed, they talk back and rolls eyes at you for requests stuff they'd automatically provide other people without asking (missing soups, warm soy sauce...etc)
Rant aside, I love their food. Steamed rice rolls are fresh, silky and delicious. Their mini soups are healthy (you add your own salt) and starts your meal nicely. Veggie side is a nice touch. Their RICE is a winner when in comes to variety and taste. Everything is perfectly seasoned that your rice taste like the toppings and your get your own distinct bowl of happiness. My favourite is Chicken with mushrooms or olive leaves and (any) meat. The bf says the unagi is decent too, although I question the authenticity/quality of the whole idea. I've been to a lot of Chinese rice casserole places but this place is hands down the best"}
{"text":"Another hidden treasure in Markham. This is one of those place you will just enjoy the food and forget about anything else. Yes, it is not the most fancy place. Yes, it doesn't have the most comfortable seating. Yes, it requires a lot of patient. However, consider the money yoipau and the quality of food. it is much better than the places beside it. I had the salty fish and minced pork. the rice was perfectly cooked. Pork was tender and salty fish was melt in your month. I tried the plain rice roll and they were freshly made, not microwave fresh. 
If you properly planned your dinner, ie, order ahead or oder while waiting. Your food will be ready when you are seated. It's not a place for propel who can't take tight seat, long waiting , outdated decor. If you come just for the food, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Good Taste! 

Lots of choices but it's all rice! It may be a heavy big lunch for some as individual portions are generous. We ordered 3 pots for table of 4 and everyone was full and more. 

Each meal comes with healthy traditional Chinese soup, and today it was apple, white fungus with dried fig. Waitress pointed out that there is no salt added and to add it ourselves if we liked. Rice hot pots were delicious, lots of rice and lots of toppings. 

4/5 as the location isn't the greatest. Peachtree Plaza parking lot is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Passed by this place the other night and my mom wanted to give it a try. 

It's a small place, probably family owned and is not too spacious. It was fully seated when we went in so we had to line up for about 10 minutes before a seat became available next to the door.

We mainly went in because of the rice roll pictures on their poster stuck on the window, unfortunately it was sold out for the day already.

We only had the choice of ordering the casseroles that came with a small soup and small dish of vegetables.

We ordered the spare ribs with Chinese sausage rice.
Disappointed that the spare ribs were not fresh, it was the dried up spare ribs just like the Chinese sausage, not what was advertised either.

We also ordered a pot of beef with egg on rice, that tasted pretty good, though I wish they made the piece of meat a little larger for the quantity of rice that you get.

The bottom of the pot was filled with lots of crispy rice, my favourite on casseroles.

The soup that was served was rather bland, but realized later that they had salt on the side for you to add at your own discretion.

It was a good experience, but the honest part of it... I could have made this at home a lot better.

Service was also average.. as there was only 1 person working at the time, so I give her props for that."}
{"text":"Thanks to my Yelp friends, I was able to discover this amazing place that serves 45 different Chinese clay pot rice bowl (???, bao zai fan).  We came here around 5pm last Sunday which wasn't too busy.  For those who are not familiar with clay pot rice, its rice and marinated meats, cooked together in one pot with flavourful sauce.  A perfectly cooked clay pot rice would have a nice crispy rice on the bottom of the pot.  I usually don't care for it but it was actually quite tasty.  I still can't believe that there is a such a place.  It's comfort food that you can never get sick of.

The rice bowls were from $8 to $11 which came with stewed soup or pop and a small veggie dish.  The soup looked really good with pears, snow fungus and pork bones but unfortunately it was very bland.  The highlight was definitely the rice bowls.  We got the #38 chicken and mushroom rice bowl & #4 preserved meat and eel rice bowl.  Both rice bowls were delicious.  We also got the beef rice noodle rolls which was also very tasty.

We will back for sure and I can't wait to try the other 43 rice bowls!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located at New Kennedy Square on Kennedy Rd and Highway 7. The parking lot is huge, so you will most likely be able to find a spot at the plaza.

[SERVICE] - 2/5
Very disorganized and busy. Servers were not polite at all because there was an overwhelming amount of customers and not enough staff. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5
Standard tables, chairs, and booths.  

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
The rice comes in a clay pot which reminisced high-quality & homemade bowls of deliciousness. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Four Treasures Rice - includes preserved meat, preserved duck, eel, and BBQ pork. This medley of meats went well with one another. The clay pot made the ingredients more aromatic as it kept the rice and meat nice and hot. 

- Chicken & Mushroom with Rice - chicken was so juicy and succulent. Mushroom also added a subtle earthy flavour to the dish. I actually prefer this Casserole Rice over Four Treasures one because the chicken so moist, and tasted super comforting. 

**Casserole Rices are served with soup/Coke/Sprite and vegetables (Chinese broccoli)**
- Soup was made with high-quality ingredients, tasted homemade with minimal or probably no MSG. Chinese broccoli on the side added lightness to the otherwise savoury and heavy casserole rices. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Sorry, the service was terrible, but the two Casserole Rices were phenomenal. As long as I'm not hangry, I will forgive poor service for a perfectly cooked meal."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good... less the fact the owner ticked me off one time when she had an attitude attack so minus one star for that. 

If you don't want to wait over 30 minutes for a bowl of rice, call ahead and order (but make sure you have the up to date version of the menu as the numbers are different). The place is small, and busy almost all the time. Their rice rolls are pretty darn good and not as greasy as dim sum restaurants might be - try the one with everything in it... forgot the name. The rice bowls comes in a pretty decent size; it's good for 2 people I'd say. Prices are decent too. It comes with a soup (no salt added) and small dish of veggies for the day. 

For those not familiar with this plaza, though, there is actually another casserole restaurant in the same plaza that's been there longer, but less known for some reason. There's not as many options as this one but the quality is on par.

If you're a fan of rice and casseroles, do give this place a try (and don't forget to order ahead!)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for lunch. Originally, we walked into New City and sat down. We realized we walked into the wrong place after looking at the menu. That was embarrassing! 

Good Taste Casserole Rice is small, but it isn't very cramped. The place is very minimally decorated, with only three posters in total on the white-colored walls. There are three rectangular tables in the middle of the restaurant and there are booths that are lined up against the walls. There's also a small refrigerator that holds a wide variety of soda cans.

As per our family's norm, we shared our meals with each other. We ordered two clay pot rice dishes as well as a rice roll dish.

First, we had the Dried Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll. It. Was. AMAZING. Daughter chose this meal because she viewed it as different. We both dazzled our helpings of the roll with soy and sriracha. The combination is both sweet and spicy, something that we like to apply to our meals when possible. Hubs loved the Dried Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll as well.

Next, the three of us shared two clay pot rice dishes with each other. We had Preserved Fish on Rice with a Raw Egg and we had Minced Pork and Egg on Rice. They were both incredibly delicious and wonderful. Hubs and Daughter both loved the Minced Pork and Egg on Rice. One of Daughter's favorite foods is minced pork, so this was definitely her favorite clay pot rice meal. I loved the Preserved Fish on Rice with a Raw Egg the most. I feel that the salted fish here was fresher than what I'm normally accustomed to. It didn't taste like it was dry and it definitely didn't taste like it came from a package.

I also forgot to mention: we got soup and soda that came with our meals. Hubs chose the soup to go with the Preserved Fish on Rice with a Raw Egg and Daughter chose to have a Canada Dry drink with the Minced Pork and Egg on Rice. Hubs and I loved the soup and Daughter loved her Canada Dry. (She usually drinks Coke, so she liked the change of pace).

Service was very good and quick. We will definitely stop by here next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"To me, casserole rice is like the Chinese version of comfort food--I feel very at home when I eat here! They have a huge selection of toppings that go along with the casserole rice, and they always pair it with a plate of chinese vegetables and a soup in a very traditional-looking container (you can also opt for pop instead). I love it!

Flavours are great and the meats are always tender, the rice is cooked perfectly, portions are very large (3 girls couldn't finish 2 bowls of the rice), and price is very reasonable. If you leave the rice in the bowl for awhile, the rice will get extra fried and you'll be left with a nice crunchy snack.

I also had their rice rolls which were quite silky and had great flavour.

I'll definitely be visiting again, especially when I'm looking for a big meal!"}
{"text":"When it comes the comfort food, I always go to Good Taste for their hot pot casserole rice.  On any given weekdays you'll start seeing a line up past 730pm.  Hint: try to get there early.  Since it's hot pot after all and it's made to order it will take a bit of time to get to your table.  They're also open for lunch as well and would have plenty of rice rolls if you want, but I find mostly for dinner they would have all sold out :(

Back to the hot pot =P Extremely YUMMY!  for $7.99+ you get a very well cooked Chinese soup while you wait for your hot pot.  When your hot pot is delivered you'll also get a small plate of boiled veggies.  This place is totally mother's approved when it comes to getting all your nutrient in one visit :)  I know my mother approves loll  

Some places they cheat a bit with their casserole rice.  This place doesn't! they the rice actually sticks to the pot (which means they didn't put in the rice last minute).  Yes ... it makes the outer most rice crispy. DELISH!

Highlight of the visit: 
2 big pot of dinner hot pot casserole rice health meal for $7.99/ea on a cold night.

{"text":"I like the variety of rice casseroles they have on the menu, and that meals always come with a soup and a side of vegetables. I always expect the wait to be long so it's not an issue and I make a point not to be in a hurried state if I eat here. The rice is not too moist in the casserole...maybe that's the proper cooking style (?), but I've become a creature of habit and prefer rice to be a bit more moist. 

The restaurant table seating in the middle is extremely awkward and puts customers on display to people sitting in the side booths. The room temperature needs to be cooler on warm days (not just relying on fans and keeping the door open since you can smell cigarettes if people are taking a drag outside and the draft picks it up)."}
{"text":"It was a really traditional Hong Kong restaurant. As a Hong Kong-er, I can really rate this restaurant to be a 4 star place. The only thing is that the restaurant is a bit too small and not very good for a group of people. Not even 5. Probably 4 people the max."}
{"text":"Good Taste Casserole Rice indeed. My favourite place in Markham for some solid Cantonese food. Best rice noodle I have ever tasted, way more authentic than all the top dim sum places in Markham. I consistently go back there every weekend for my Sunday brunch. All I can say about the food is that it is absolutely incredible: fresh and delicious.

As a frequent customer I have learned a few tips about this place:

The stewed soups are good, but they haven't been seasoned. You'll have to add salt to yours or it'll be quite bland. 

The store is also quite small and is extremely packed on the weekends and during popular meal times. It's conveniently located in the New Kennedy Square plaza so expect a hard time finding parking. I always order by phone then pick it up when I get there and I suggest you do as well.

Amazing food, though. Honestly, the food triumphs all of the aforementioned shortcomings. Good Taste Casserole Rice is more like Great Taste Casserole Rice in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Good Taste Casserole Rice now no longer just serves Casserole Hot Pot Rice. 

During the day or even for breakfast, you can order congee and steamed rice roll.

??? Preserved Meat Casserole ($9.99) and ??? Steamed Rice Roll with Pork ($3.50) were both tasty. Tons of toppings on the casserole but I wish there is more crisped rice at the bottom. The rice roll would be better if they have hot sauce and some garnish on top.

I would definitely be back for some more and try out other items in the menu.

Service is friendly and homey. I do love the complimentary soup that goes with the rice!"}
{"text":"Super filling for a great price. It seems like a great deal because you also get a small plate of veggies with a drink/soup along with your rice. The soup is a pretty bland, but good effort. I really liked the rice rolls because they are all wrinkly (which I THINK is a sign that the roll is nice and thin). If you're looking to be full for under $10, check it out!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The new Kennedy plaza is full of Asian stores, but Good Taste Casserole Rice is pretty unique! I don't think there are a lot of places in Markham, let alone the GTA that simply specialize in hot stone bowl rice dishes.

Each dish comes with soup, a veggie side dish, and a huge stone bowl with crispy rice and meat/veggie toppings. The portion sizes are also quite big. Three people can easily share two bowls and get super full.

The rice also tastes really good! The crispy parts of the edges coupled with the casserole \"gravy\" makes the rice really really flavourful. The spices used to marinate the meats that top the rice are also very rich and savory. Most of the meats are definitely on the salty side (ie. preserved fish, sausages, bbq eel, bbq pork, curry, olives, etc.) Despite the saltiness, the dish is well balanced with the almost pure-tasting soup and veggies.

The service here is also super super amazing! Once I had to rush for a doctor's appointment - but the casserole rice had JUST arrived (these dishes take quite some time to make obviously). So we ended up just paying the bill up front and kindly requesting the server to keep the dish warm while we were at the doctor's, and that we would promptly return to finish our meal. Despite the hecticness of the place, the owner was VERY compliant. She quickly brought the dish aside and cleaned the table so another family could sit down and be served. Within 45 minutes we returned and the server kindly greeted us, made some space for us, and gave back our casserole dish which was kept hot as promised :) (although obviously it would've tasted better if served right off the stove but we had to leave :c )

Good food + amazing service + great price point = 5 stars :D"}
{"text":"They make rice with varieties of toppings served in your own bowl. Worth the wait, because they cook it right after you order. Would come back again."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant inside Kennedy square plaza. I was looking forward to trying this place due to a number of good reviews. However my recent experience was very disappointing. We came for dinner around 540pm (to beat the dinner rush). We got a table right away (restaurant was 1/3 full only); but took 10min to get the menu. By then restaurant was jam packed. We were one of the first groups that submitted the order. It took OVER 45MINS to get our food. And we were told then that  the complimentary soup that comes with the food wasn't ready for \"a long time\" 
Rice casseroles were just ok IMO. Portion was large but mostly rice. Toppings were quite skimpy; there was way more rice than topping ratio. Soup finally arrived post our meal; and it was quite bland. It wasn't worth the long wait. 
Overall it was a chaotic experience; lots of frustration and long wait just for mediocre food. Likely won't return"}
{"text":"small restaurant.. it feels very bare in this restaurant.. always feels like its missing something.. like even a picture on the wall or something.. 

its anything but cozy... anyways.. the menu is very limited.. they specialize in the rice bowls in a piping hot ceramic bowl.  the food took 20-25 minutes.. luckily they give you soup. 

The soup was very good and individually cooked in small containers.. it was impressive but no salt.. which can be a good thing..

the rice was just okay for me.. nothing special or fancy.. 

the vegetables were on the sad side... its just cheap cabbage .. not the leafy vegetable but the very white looking kind thats boiled down..

the value is okay considering bowl kee in the same plaza is alot more expensive.   I think they should consider expanding their menu though.. they have no appetizers."}
{"text":"Don't expect a fancy restaurant but definitely good selection and quality of rice pot. A very simple restaurant and a little outdated look and feel but they have a good selection and authentic rice pots. It takes some time to get the food but they are made on the spot. The price is good to fair considering the size of the rice pot you get, it is bigger than most places. 

I would consider check this place out if I am not in a hurry for food or if the two HK cafe beside it are completely booked up."}
{"text":"Good Taste Casserole is my favorite spot for a good clay pot rice. It comes with soup, veg, and a large pot of clay pot rice for around 10$. You can't go wrong with that! 

The service here is at the minimum, don't expect much of any service and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Great place for clay pot rice. So many choices! Your should call 45 mins ahead to put in your order so that when you arrive they'll sit you asap.  The rice takes time to prepare so they won't seat you unless yours is almost ready.  I recommend the minced pork with pickle cabbage rice or the BBQ pork rice. Definitely scrape off the crusted rice at the bottom of the pot. It's flavoured and crispy."}
{"text":"I came because I was promised Chinese comfort food. Yup. Got it!

Location:
Kennedy and 7 in a huge area with lots of restaurants and other stores.

Parking:
Huge ass parking lot. Where this place is there's also a lot of businesses that aren't open in the evening so you can generally find parking easy!

Decor:
Hole in the wall would be the best way to describe it.
It's tiny. There are booths and tables in the middle

Food:
Bowls of rice heated on the bottom so you get a crispy layer. Topped with meat and veg. You also get a small side vegetable and either a soup or a pop. Pretty inexpensive.

Clients:
It's really busy but tables turn fast! There's also a lot of people taking out food.


I'll come back again. I liked this place!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by my non-Yelping brother!!! They make rice in stone pots, there's a LOT of options. Each rice comes with a plate of vegetables and a mini pot of soup. The soup is very very good.

I ordered the Five Treasures and it must be good because there are FIVE treasures. Unfortunately underneath this is a giant pot of rice, and I ate all my treasures without finishing the rice. A little boring. However!!

The other pots: dried scallop and pork is reeally good. But we all agreed that the octopus omelette is the most delicious. 

Lesson learned here!! The octopus omelette is actually the saltiest while the Five Treasures is the most bland. I think they make really good toppings but since the pot is not enough burned as traditional stone pots, the toppings must be salty enough to mix with your giant pot of plain white rice."}
{"text":"This is a family run restaurant, when you order a casserole rice, comes with a soup and a small dish of blanched leafy vegetable, very reasonable price, little green on service but still great."}
