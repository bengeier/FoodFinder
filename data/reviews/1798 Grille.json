{"text":"Amazing burgers and fries, hand breaded mushrooms, can't wait to try the award - winning chili next time! A lovely owner, a wonderful and friendly wait person, and the nicest place we could've eaten for our anniversary dinner!  Clean and friendly with a view of \"downtown\" Burton, good music playin', free wifi, and knock out food, hot and fresh - can't wait to come back. Get my chocolate milkshake ready - I'll be back real soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. The food was so-so. Not what I would expect for the price. Our Burton Bruiser Burger was way under cooked and lacked flavor. The quesadillas was nothing more than a tortilla with some shredded cheddar that was thrown on the flat top. Again, just no flavor. Total bill was $24. That's 1 burger a quesadilla appetizer and 2 ice teas. Way to pricey for what you get. Skip this place and go next door to Coffee Corners for soup and sandwich!"}
{"text":"For what this restaurant's about - burgers, straight up, no frills - 5 stars!  Been hankering for a real burger all week - thick juicy flavorful burger, not a bunch of fast food bun.  

Gotta admit, in the years it existed, despite living barely 2 miles away, we NEVER visited the establishment that formerly occupied this space (Tom & Jerry's) - way too many negative reviews both on and off Yelp.  Glad to see the new owners are actually making an attempt to connect with their local audience and give them what they want in a quality manner.

Ordered The Fair burger, their double cheeseburger, and their Patty Melt.  I wasn't as much of a fan of their Patty Melt as their The Fair.  But I asked for medium rare, I got medium rare.  With all the expected fixings and plenty of meat, I'm a happy camper.  Fast, friendly service and clean atmosphere - what more could we demand?   

We're already making plans to come back here again on our next burger crave."}
{"text":"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant formerly located in the space was a dive and the food was worse. 

This time, under new management, the interior got a facelift. It was a huge improvement but the building is so old it's hard to really make it look much better and the floor is uneven in spaces, so watch your step.

We had no trouble finding a seat for our party of five, which included three children.

The service was prompt and we ordered within a couple of minutes.

I had the Kickin BBQ Bacon burger and my wife ordered the Shroom 'N Provolone. The kids all had something different: sliders, chicken fingers and grilled cheese.

Portion sizes were adequate and overall the food received high marks.

My wife ordered her burger medium and it definitely was on the rare side of medium (acceptable, but know that going in). I ordered mine medium well and it was on the medium side, so they certainly have a consistency in their cooking.

The prices are about what you'd find at similar restaurants.

We'll be back as there are a few other burgers and items I'd like to try."}
{"text":"I got a Reuben it was really greasy, no thousand island and the meat was chewy.  Salad was nothing special either. I annoyed i paid 9 dollars for all it.  I wont be returning"}
