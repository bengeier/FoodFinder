{"text":"If you are looking for afternoon snacks/lunches this is the place to visit. They've got so many selections for you to choose from, and considering old-fashioned fries and poutine are quite hard to find near Pacific mall. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very creative decor! I was lured into this little stand fir the Asian BBQ on a stick. While I was waiting for the freshly cooked sticks, I order the poutine. I was pleasantly surprised to see the poutine freshly prepared as well. It comes a little light on the fries but plenty of Bacon, beef and curds. Was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Its awesome! The foods so good! :) its definitely has a food truck/ street food kind of feel. The foods greasy BUT a good greasy so dieters BEWARE!

{"text":"Love it! The poutine here actually better than the New York fries! We bought the deal from groupon!! And it was totally worth!! I will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon to this place ($5.99 for two orders of poutine).

The poutine was quite good - I wanted to order one beef and one bacon, but they did not have anymore beef, so we ended up just ordering one bacon and one regular poutine. Not being a big fan of bacon, it was surprisingly good. The bacon was flavourful and chewy, and added a great taste to the fries, cheese and gravy. The regular poutine was just as good, if not better. Gravy was dark and thick, but too salty in my opinion. The fries were definitely a hit! Crispy and yummy but not over-fried. They probably could give a bit more cheese curds though (I love that stuff!).

The service - one person working. When we arrived and showed him that we had a groupon, he quickly said, \"You need to wait ten minutes.\" We were a little confused, but then we went for a walk around the upper floor, came back in about 10 minutes, and to our surprise, our fries were freshly made, waiting for us on the counter. We showed him the groupon, he 'redeemed' it, we got the poutine and left. Quick and easy, no fuss.

TLDR: worth a try, IMHO."}
{"text":"Went here today. The steak fingers had so much flavor per bite, and the normal poutine was really good. 

The only problem was the price since it had to compete with everything else in pmall."}
{"text":"Yay, the first one to review this place :) I'm a bit surprised considering this place is on the 2nd floor/food court level of Pacific Mall with a good amount of foot traffic at least on weekends, if not weekdays, and it's been opened for quite awhile.

I got the Bacon Poutine ($4.59) and it was generally good. The portion of fries may not be as big as what you get from hot dog trucks and other poutine places downtown, but the amount of bacon here makes up for it. I'm actually quite impressed with the bacon because my expectation wasn't very high and I was just expecting a poutine with some quick fried bacon bits thrown in. But made fresh to order, this poutine comes with a fair amount of cheese curds and at least 6 whole pieces of skillet fried bacon strips. Biting into whole pieces of bacon that's been skillet fried really let you taste the full flavor of the bacon.

However, I find the gravy a bit too salty. If the saltiness could be toned down a bit, then the whole thing would be perfect.

According to the menu, they also serve beef burgers, chicken burgers and what looks to be Asian style grilled squid tentacles on a stick. Only in Pacific Mall will you find a burger and poutine joint serving Asian style street food :) Didn't get to try it this time, but definitely will do next time.

Decor: The walls are covered with vintage pop culture mini posters arranged like tiles. Lots of black, white and red. Eye catching indeed. Like other booths in the area, it's not very big and there are only 2 small tables and a few chairs to the side for eating in.

Overall, I enjoyed the poutine and I would come back again, maybe to try out their other products. Maybe they need to test out how well poutine can sell up here, but I would certainly like to see more variety of poutines on their menu."}
{"text":"Like everyone else has been saying on here, there's not that much fries but they don't skimp on the toppings (cheese, gravy, meat). Got the bacon/beef poutine and they were both very flavourful, fresh, hot, and made to order. It was a pretty sizeable portion, and the fries were blanched (specific method of cooking fries that makes them crispy but not overcooked). 

Did use a groupon to try out this place (2 poutines for $5.99), but definitely will come back to this place for a quick snack/small meal. Would recommend!"}
