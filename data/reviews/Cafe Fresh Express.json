{"text":"Cafe Fresh is a great alternative to other food court offerings, albeit a bit pricier.   The food is always fresh and made with incredibly high quality ingredients. I usually get the Sunny Capri crepe or the Hummus wrap.   However, the service is sort of iffy. Sometimes the employees are too busy texting or flirting with each other when they're supposed to be making your order. But usually, it's not a problem.   If you're spending an afternoon at the mall and want a healthy lunch (or snack), this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of healthy fast food. They have shots of delicious wheatgrass! Made the mistake of ordering a crepe. Was loaded with cheese and one tiny spec of basil. Not so healthy!"}
{"text":"I had a pineapple kale smoothie, a shot of wheatgrass, and a veggie quesadilla. The quesadilla and smoothie were great, I do think the wheatgrass was a bit overpriced at $2.50 for 1oz. The reason for two stars is the poor customer service. I am an avid juicer and have ran a juice bar business for a few years now and wheatgrass is to be served fresh, the wheatgrass that was served to me had been sitting out for a few minutes and I simply asked for a fresh batch to be juiced right then, why did I do that? Three of the baristas wanted to argue saying that the juice first given to me was freshly made from the previous customers order. But I'm sorry I watched it sitting there for a few minutes and would like a new ounce or have my money back. This argumentative behavior continued by two other baristas. Nevertheless, after a few minutes of banter I got a new shot. But this was an awful experience. Oh and before I forget one of the baristas took a few seconds to kindly blow her nose while I was waiting for my food, so disgusting...especially for a supposedly healthy eating establishment. Good luck eating here hopefully their hands are clean after blowing noses!"}
{"text":"Fresh Healthy Cafe has it all - super smoothies, fresh juices, crepes, wraps, salads and my personal favorite - their quesadilla.  It is located in the food court at Beachwood Mall.  The owner and the employees are great at customer service, and knowledgeable about their selections.  Everything is made as you order it - totally fresh !!  (Depending on the number of customers, there is a short wait - but well worth it) The Pomegranate Punch,  Caribbean Splash, Kiwi Quencher, Pineapple Paradise and Tropical Peach are my favorite smoothies.  The Seafood Crepes w/hot mayo (has a touch of Sriracha) are scrumptious.  The crepe selection is divided into sweet crepes (including the Classic w/nutella & bananas) Vegetarian Crepes and Savory Crepes.  You can add additional ingredients for $.50 to any crepe.   My go-to most favorite here is the Spinach Mushroom Quesadilla - chicken breast, spinach, mushrooms, mozzarella & tomatoes.  It comes with salsa and sour cream, you can add guacamole for $0.75. Perhaps the Best Quesadilla I have ever had - anywhere ! The Fresh Squeezes and Juices are Awesome - Super Detox, Mega Energy, Body Purifier and Cholesterol Buster are great. The smoothies, fresh squeezes and juices & ice teas come in medium or large sizes.  You can eat at the food court or take home.   Great healthy choices at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Cafe Fresh is my favorite place in the food court.  Its the only place with healthy options and there's a lot to choose from.  There's something for everyone, whether you're simple and want a pineapple smoothie, or you want something harder to come by like a dragonfruit smoothie bowl with coconut shavings or an avocado smoothie.  I usually get the sweet cheese crepe with strawberries.  Its strawberries, some type of cheese, im thinking maybe goat based on the texture and taste, and powdered sugar.  Its delicious. You also have the option of banana, but I've never tried that.  I ordered a strawberry juice here once, and I wasnt impressed. It's definitely better to go with a smoothie.   As far as food, I forget the exact name, but I've ordered the salad and the panini that has chicken, bacon, avocado, and ranch.  I definitely liked it better as a salad.  It was a nice size for six dollars and I have no complaints about freshness.  The staff is chill.  They aren't exuberant but they aren't rude either. They take longer than any of the other restaurants, but thats the cost of freshness, I suppose."}
{"text":"Ok, any place that can take my two loves, avocados and sweet things, merge them together into am amazing treat, will have me hook line and sinker. This amazingly delicious treat I am referring to is the avocados and cream smoothie at Cafe Fresh Express! With about 30 different smoothie offerings, fresh squeezed juices, wraps, salads and sweet and savory crepes, this place has something for everyone. If I had to choose only only place to eat lunch the rest of my life, this very well may be it. All the smoothies I have tried are fruity and refreshing. I have had several wraps and crepes and have loved everything I've ever gotten here. The sweet crepes are decadent and will surely satisfy any sweet tooth you may have.  If you are looking for something besides the typical mall food court fare or a healthy and delicious lunch, Cafe Fresh fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Not what pictured when ordering an AÃ§ai bowl. No fresh fruit except banana. Very sugary."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this business. I think they fall short as being a healthy alternative to competitors in the mall. Every time I've been here, there is no such thing as express. That name is misleading. The staff there is always extremely slow. I was the only person they were serving. I ordered a wrap and it to in excess of 10 minutes. I can make a wrap for myself in my kitchen for the same amount of time. In addition last time i was there, I was heading home, said my order was to go and asked for a receipt. No receipt and no bag for my food. Also, their salads and wraps are too small. They never satisfy a meal for me. On the positive side, I've had two different wraps and have liked them both."}
{"text":"Acai bowls, smoothies, crepes are yours for the asking!  Order up one Capri (tomato, basil, fresh mozzarella) crepe & a small pomegranate passion smoothie...just a few minutes later...tasty.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always love getting smoothies any time I go to a mall - they're the perfect way to fill up and easy to walk around with. Cafe Fresh's smoothies are yummy - my favorite is the pomegranate punch. Their crepes also sound delicious, but I haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"Great place in Beachwood! I love their crepes and fast service. Also, as I'm a healthy food fan- I like fresh squeezed juices that the place offers. My favorite is carrot mix with apple juices- healthy. My favorite savory crepe is honey turkey mustard- I often ask for less dressing because sometimes dressing destroys a taste of a crepe. Try it."}
{"text":"Finally a healthy place to eat at the mall. The food isn't cheap but it is good. The smoothies are made with fresh fruit and the wheat grass shits are made to order. I like how they give you a bite of orange with the shots.  I like the Cesar salad wraps and the kale salad wraps are good too."}
{"text":"Really great food! Had a wrap and it was pretty darn good. Wait time was about 10 minutes, but no biggy. It was worth the wait. They make the food in front of you so you know what's up. Also had a smoothie and it tasted pretty darn good as well. Very happy they actually had a healthy place to eat in the mall."}
{"text":"It's a go to spot for a healthy meal in the mall, but their service is extremely slow!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!  I get protein power smoothy and the apple harvest chicken wrap.  Yum!"}
{"text":"A healthy menu. The wait is a bit longer as the signs indicate. However since the reason is because everything is made fresh I will gladly wait any day. Grab a sample of the smoothies being made while you wait on your order. The menu items are creative and I always can find a new smoothie to try - lately I like the pineapple and kale smoothie. Beachwood mall tries to have healthier food court options than your traditional fast food Burger King type venues and this one definitely tops the list of places I eat while I shop. Their menu also have unique things you can't get anywhere else such as crepes."}
{"text":"I love the Asian Chicken wrap here. Although I'd love to see a location outside of the mall, I haven't found a similar wrap in the area. Today I picked up a wrap for myself and a fruit-filled crepe for my little one. She loved the fruit, and the chicken from my wrap! We ended up sharing both. I've yet to order a smoothie, but the samples are always tasty. This is a nice alternative to the other fast food options in the food court."}
