{"text":"Best Bibimbap I've had in a long time! Quick service and excellent food for a takeout!"}
{"text":"Bobs Bulgogi is run by a friendly couple serving up Korean food, fast food style.   I ordered the Beef Bulgogi and asked for spicy, with noodles. The spicy was sniffling-and-drinking-2-bottles-of-water spicy! The sauce, despite the heat was good, but it seemed like it didn't really cook with the noodles long enough for the noodles to absorb the sauce and be flavoured. So it was sometimes super flavourful sometimes bland and chewy depending on the ratio of beef:noodle in your mouthful.   I've only been here once and its debateable if I will go again despite the excellent, friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I walking by Bob's a few months ago while running an errand and promised myself I'd go back and check it out. Today I was concidentally running another errand around lunchtime so I stopped in. What a fool for waiting so long... that was easily the tastiest Korean food I've ever had. This takeout place easily beat all the Korean restaurants I've been to. The restaurants' food was \"ehh.. ok\" so I assumed the whole cuisine was \"meh\". I apologize :)  I ordered the spicy beef bulgogi with noodles, and had a small spicy kimchi and the free miso soup on the side. The cuts of meat were good and lean, the noodles were the right firmness and it was spicy enough for flavor but not so hot that I'd need water to cool it down. And, it was prepared very quickly!! The place is tiny, only 4 chairs in front of a window. And it's easy to miss from the street... they could really use a sidewalk sign. Regardless, it is now firmly in my downtown finance district lunch rotation along with St Lawrence Mkt and Ritz for good cooked food."}
{"text":"great little place - try the beef bulgogi with noodles - busy at lunch on weekdays so u may have to wait a while - I work in the area and go there frequently and the food is always reliable - good portion size for relatively low price  Recommended"}
{"text":"This place is great, beef bulgogi is amazing, just wish it had some more meat."}
{"text":"For the price I paid and considering that it is in the core downtown area, I think this place is pretty good. I would go back again, especially with the limited options for Korean food options downtown. They even do tofu bulgogi! I was super excited to find that.  As for seating, be prepared to not have a seat. There are a few bar stools as well as 2 very narrow tables which are 2-seaters each basically. The shop isn't very big so you might feel a bit cramped. It's great in the summer when you can just buy and take it away since there are small parks nearby where you can sit and enjoy your food. Or if you want to just go out for a walk to get lunch and go back to your desk to eat it, that's an option too. Your meal includes a free miso (self serve station) soup."}
{"text":"This restaurant is (almost)  literally a whole in the wall! I live very close and walked by without even noticing the restaurant. The awning sign out front did not entice me to give a second look. I was brought by a friend and was shocked when I walked inside. It's a really stylish, cool space. The people working there are young and very friendly. The food is cooked to order and so good. I got the Bim Bim Bab (Bop?). I have been back since and love this place. Their prices are reasonable, but eating in is a challenge - it's tiny. If you're in the neighbourhood, check it out - and if you're not, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. This is my third or fourth time and I'm a fan now. Food is just the right kind of level of spiciness that it doesn't make you want to cry (this is of course rated for someone who has good tolerance of spicey food).  Portions are just right, and as mentioned by Stephanie, it's not fatty. I really liked their noodles too. To top it all off, it's under $8 which these days is a good price.  Try it out and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Tried it out after the reviews. It was okay. Nothing mind blowing"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful and quick dinner here last night. Really appreciated \"Bob\" (aka owner-operator In Jae Lee) taking extra care to prepare our eat-in dinner at the window/bar.  We had a beef bulgogi on rice, beef bibambob, small sides of kimchi and green tea. Balanced flavours, tasty, not greasy at all and a perfect portion size -- you'll be full but not feel overstuffed. I thought it offered good value for the money since you're getting fresh ingredients cooked up quickly.  Bob said lunchtime is usually quite busy, but his nights are slow. Now that we've tried it, will be stopping in for some dinnertime take-out more often."}
{"text":"The dish, the price, the atmosphere were all great. Can't wait to get back there. I had a bibimbap with beef and it was a good size portion that came with a free miso soup. Everything was cooked to a perfection and their rice is to die for. Very yammy.:)  It is a good place for a quick lunch or to take out. Unfortunately it has only 4 seating places inside."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp telling me about this place.  I was looking for a change from my usual Loblaws lunch  and saw the reviews on this place were decent.I arrived a little after 11.30am and was the second person in line. As others have noted, it's at 105 Richmond and is a small place with seating for about 4 people.  I got the mild beef bulgogi with noodles (8.95+tx). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food is cooked per order as opposed to a one size fits all. There's also free miso soup.  I also like that they line their foam take out containers with foil. It definitely kept my food warm after the walk back.  The meat was tender and well cooked, a little sweet but I'll try the spicy next time. The portions are big and for a light eater, can easily be 2 meals.The service was great and I was in and out of there in about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Super good, beef nicely marinated and tender, top notch.  The place is really small with little seating so be aware"}
{"text":"This is some good Bulgogi. Had the beef bulgogi noodles (mild): - Good beef, well bulgogi'd. - Noodles nice, standard stuff - Decent portions for the cost  Will return to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. Everything is made to order and very fresh. The mild beef bulgogi noodles have a sweet teriyaki-ish taste and a perfectly soft, chewy texture.   The wait time is a little long for people who only have 30 minutes for lunch, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch for beef bulgogi.  The food was good, and the people are alright.  The food is cooked fresh when ordered.  However for the price, I feel there should be more meat and veggies."}
{"text":"Great little joint. I had the bulgogi with rice. A fine cure for a hangover on a Saturday morning. The side of kimchi was pretty small; you might want to ask for extra. Seating is limited, so it's basically take-out only on a weekday around lunch time. If you like Korean but don't have time for a trip to Bloor west of Bathurst this will do just fine."}
{"text":"Basically the same stir fry with sweet sauce that you can get from any other asian fusion place. I got the bulgogi and it didn't feel anything close to healthy.   There are two items on the menu: bulgogi and bibimbap ( with a choice of tofu/shrimp/beef/chicken and rice/noodle)  The prices fall towards $$ (definitely not $). The items are in the range of 10$-11$ after tax and it takes fairly long for them to get the order ready so I guess it wasn't really what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've only had the noodles but from what I taste, it's not really that Korean (which is neither here nor there), but it's definitely a good choice for the downtown core for the price point and for it NOT being Manchu Wok or some b.s. The beef bulgogi in the noodles is pretty good but I find the sauce of the noodles themselves a little too westernized. It's definitely NOT just regular bulgogi sauce. Tastes like it's mixed with some sweet and sour sauce (like the kind that comes on sweet and sour pork). But overall a great flavour profile and I'm satisfied for $9.   Cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch at about 12:30 on a weekday. It was quite busy, took us about 30 min to get our food. Definitely aim for before/after the rush.  Had the classic Beef Bulgogi. It was really good. The flavour was a bit milder than what I would have expected, but if that's coming from less salt+MSG than other places than awesome. I really enjoyed it, and will be going back.  Great price, good food, and something interesting in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"Love the bibimbap at Bob's. Each order is made fresh. I've tried the beef, chicken and shrimp. I can't pick a favourite. It's the perfect combination of veggies protein and rice.  I go at least once a week for lunch. Call ahead and order they don't have many seats there."}
{"text":"It is around the corner. It is solid. Everything tastes good.  My go to is shrimp on noodles. I would like if the stayed open later but it is what it is. Support small businesses...eat at Bob's."}
{"text":"Spicy beef bulgogi = amazing. Reasonably priced, cool atmosphere, great music. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not bad. I get take here once an a while. I like the Bulgogi with rice. You get a big portion at a cheap price - $7 - $8 per dinner. The Bamboo is also good. The place is tiny, best for takeout. The staff is friendly and provide good service. The food is cooked fresh, not under a heat lamp like food courts in the area. Lunch time can get a little busy. You can get better Korean food elsewhere but for the price and location, it's worth a stop when your in the area."}
{"text":"Before today I had no idea what a Bulgogi (sure is fun to say though!), thankful Bob has photos on the wall to guide novices in their lunch selection. Bob's is not very noticeable but their bulgogi is certainly delicious. I had mine medium spicy, my colleague who asked for the spicy version was sweating! They cook all of the food fresh when you order, and the meat is very good quality and low in fat. My only complaint with Bob's is that they are stingy on the meat and vegetables--all carbs in this meal.  If you're planning on eating in, there are only four stools, facing out the window. I think mostly do take away."}
{"text":"Lunch...discovered this place on my walk home a couple of weeks ago...I was thinking, hey, a new Korean food place I must try, only to find out it's been around for 7 years...even though the address indicates Victoria St., it's actually on Richmond...it's a small, cramped place with a minimalist menu, only bulgogi and bibimbap are served with either shrimp, beef, chicken or tofu...I got the spicy shrimp bulgogi...the bulgogi is very flavorful and tasty but not too spicy...the shrimp is cooked perfectly and the sticky rice is as it should be...the only downside is the long wait, but the food is fresh and cooked in front of you...this is one place I will put on my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I've been to Bob's Bulgogi twice.  The food is not bad, I had a spicy chicken udon for 6.95.  However, the portion is so small that it feels as though I hadn't eaten anything.  They make your food after you order, and it takes about 10 - 12 minutes.  I wouldn't mind, but when it gets crowded, it's kind of awkward standing in such a small space, with people wanting to move all around.  In addition, there was a customer who came after me, who was served before me.  I realize that there are regular, loyal customers.  But try not to show their preferential treatment in front of everyone else.  I remember they gave her a bag, extra kimchi, and a miso soup.    Meanwhile, I was given the container, with a separate packet of kimchi.  Along with my Mcdonald's ice coffee, I was able to drop everything - I wasn't offered a bag.  I would recommend having standard dishes made before people order, so the line moves quicker.  This place isn't for me."}
{"text":"So cute and so on the way home.  How can you go wrong?!?!  I had the Beef Bulgogi to go but I wish I had the Bibimbap instead.  The beef was plentiful and yummy.  Great take-out place just wish they offered brown rice.  I cannot wait for the new menu and I will have to try everything they have at least once."}
{"text":"Great price with good portions. You can tell it is a lunch time favourite in the area because the line up goes out the door! Bulgogi is authentic and tastes great. Not too many Korean places by the St Lawrence market so I'll come here to get my fix."}
{"text":"Still good but portion sizes have decreased significantly.  Now you pay more to get less food.  I can understand smaller meat portions but rice is not expensive."}
{"text":"Although the address of this restaurant says Victoria, it's actually located around the corner on Richmond St.  I was planning on dining in, but there was only seating for about 4 people.  The menu included both vegetarian and meat options.  I went with beef bulgogi for $8.  It was a generous portion of tender bulgogi beef stir fried with vegetables (onion, carrots, green and red bell peppers, and mushrooms) over rice.  The sauce was on the sweet side, but maybe because I went with the mild version instead of spicy.  A small side of kimchi is also included.  The service was fast.  There's a self serve miso station (broth) where you can scoop your own miso that comes with every entree.  You can also add some green onion to the soup."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and found this place to be very average. Located in the outskirts of the Financial District (more or less), decor is hip and stylish yet still quite homey and comforting. The menu has quite a variety of rice and noodle options. Service is also very pleasant and quick. The space isn't very large - there are a few stools/chairs if you'd like to sit in (not more than 4 to 5 stools/chairs), so this is more of a take-out place than sit in.   I ordered the Beef Bulgogi with Rice for lunch, which cost me a little over $10.00 after taxes. However, portion size was quite small for what I paid (the food was placed in a small takeout box). While the beef texture was nice and tender, the flavour seemed plain and not marinated as well as other bulgogi dishes I've had in the city. It was a so-so stir-fry without all the spices and marinade you're used to. It was an okay meal but not more than average.  I wouldn't recommend that you go out of your way to try this place out, as you'll most likely be disappointed by the food quality. However, if you're in the area and craving Korean food, it wouldn't hurt to stop by. It isn't a terribly bad choice, just keep in mind that the food will most likely be pretty ordinary."}
{"text":"They were out of rice.  Kind of unbelievable,but whatever. Had the noodle bulgogi with shrimp. Tasted fresh even though I was not a fan of the noodles. Probably would have been very good with the rice. I will come back, if they are out of rice next time I will leave."}
{"text":"I spotted Bob's after driving on Richmond once and made a point of going there.   I ordered the beef bim-bim-bap and had it to stay in.  The couple working there are certainly very friendly, and the portions were large enough.    The food was great, although I wish my dish was a bit more hotter (temperature-wise).  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I come by for takeout. It's a small shop so not many dine in seats. The food is good and authentic. They make it for you after you order it so expect to wait if there's a lineup."}
{"text":"The spicy tofu bulgogi with rice is the best take-out lunch I've had in ages."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in the financial core. Although it is farther away (you have to walk outside from the farthest PATH exit), it is worth the walk. I have introduced this place to a few of my friends, and they all agree this was a great place for lunch! Hope they will be here for a while!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last 7 days. Food is not too bad. I ordered a spicy bulgogi on noodles and it wasn't that spicy. Just a faint kick. LOVE thier bibimbap!"}
{"text":"What a surprise to be walking down Richmond Street East and be greeted by wafting smells of cooked meat. It was lunchtime: I had a throbbing headache and my stomach was growling loudly. Not familiar with the area, I made an impulsive turn on Richmond and saw a small line-up. The wind carried the sweet smell of cooked meat and I embraced it like a zombie wanting more brains to its origin.   Bob's Bulgogi is a tiny restaurant. It's more of a take-out place but you can eat in, enjoying your meals on bar stools and watching life walk past Richmond.   I've had their bulgogi beef ($8.95) and on my second visit, their vegetarian bibimbob ($7.95), and was impressed with both of my orders. The beef was well-cooked, the veggies were fresh and they used sticky steamed white rice. The dishes weren't greasy at all, mild in its spicy content and I didn't leave a single morsel on my plate.   You'll always be greeted warmly at Bob's Bulgogi. The owners and staff are very friendly and it's obvious that they make customer service their top priority, as well as their delicious food."}
{"text":"Ordered kimchi fried rice that was not in the menu and it was good! Order came up to 10 otherwise, I would have like it more.  Also, I was hoping to be able to sit in and eat, but its not ideal to stay and eat here. They have some chairs against the front of the shop, but no table, only a counter. Oh and their miso soup is complimentary. You can help yourself."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend during a weekday. We went here around 1 pm and it was very busy even then. Bulgogi in my opinion can be described as Korean stir fry. I ordered a spicy chicken one, it was a delicious stir fry with kimchi. I was very satisfied with my meal and the portion. They also have complimentary miso soup, which is ideal to sip on while they prepare your fresh food! Note that this place is primarily a take out place, seating is available for four people max. If you work or go to school in the downtown core then try this place out on Victoria street."}
{"text":"Should be renamed Bob's Perfect Bibimbap, because that is their star dish.   It's a normal day at our office when I look around and see 7 or 8 people at our lunch table chowing down on their Bibimbap.   It's the perfect dish: a bit of beef, rice, assorted veggies, and a sunnyside-up egg in the middle.  Add to that their free miso soup and pickled radish (or kimchi depending on the season) and you've got a lunch that's yummy, pretty to look at, not expensive, and healthy.  All bases covered. One tip: call ahead to order this dish - lines are long'ish and slow'ish, but calling the order in skips you up the queue without needing to budge in line ;-)"}
{"text":"Tastes great. I'm not a great judge of Korean food authenticity but tasted right to me. Right mix of spice. Very good for a quick delicious lunch. Call ahead about 30-45 mins for quick pickup."}
{"text":"Lines at lunch,  and not the most efficient kitchen. But very very good.  Portions are fine. Prices reasonable. I go back once or twice a month, trying to get there before the noon crowd."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Very busy during lunch, and only 4 spots to sit in and eat, so during lunch it pretty much becomes a take-out joint."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time at around 1140 and the place was already pretty packed. Very small space - 4 seats, so likely you'll get your lunch, if you decide to eat around that time, to go.   Service wise the lady behind the counter was very friendly and took my order quickly. I got the chicken bulgogi with rice which came to almost $10. Took around 10 minutes to get my order as there were a few orders ahead of me. The dish was very flavourful and yummy, but I thought the portion of the rice wasnt enough given the amount of chicken, but I'm not complaining! The more chicken the better! Free miso soup on the left side of the restaurant as well, which was flavourful and complimented the meal well. Overall would come back again to try the other dishes! My coworker got the bibimbap which looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Perfect quick delicious healthy authentic - no real seating but good for one person great for takeout Beef Bougogi with Brown rice - good veggies"}
{"text":"It's in the 150 Victoria building but it is located on Richmond, not Victoria!!  Tiny store, perfect for take out. I got the Shrimp Bulgogi with medium spciy. They have Spicy and Mild on their display but you can definitely \"customize\" your preferred spiciness as they make it on the spot. For the price you pay, you get a decent amount of rice, lots of veggies and a surprising amount of shrimp. There is also free soup on the side where you can pack for yourself, but I did not bother.  There is a bit of a wait, longer than your usual food court wait time, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The best part about Bob's Bulgogi is the decor: the funky, 'antique' bulbs (same as the ones in Guu), the lacquered table tops and the hip itunes playlist. It's a tiny place with just a couple tables, so it's mostly take out fare. I've had their bulgogi and unfortunately the meal smells better than it tastes: lacking the sesame flavor, a bit on the sweeter side, definitely no punch even when asked for spicy. The portions are pretty ample, wish the quality caught up with their quantity. However, service is always cheerful and polite."}
{"text":"Went to Bob's bulgogi during lunch and it was hella packed! Had to wait around 20+ mins to order and get my food. The smell of bbq smoke can be overwhelming inside; and you will end up smelling like Chinese food when you leave the place.   The food is mediocre and it's priced pretty decently! It was a bit too oily to my liking but that's expected for korean food. The bulgogi was flavourful but would've been better with more sauce."}
{"text":"Score should really be 4.5, and I would come back here again  Had the chicken bibimbap as takeout at 1pm and just under $10. I don't usually get bibimbap, but I would say this is the most elegant looking one I've ever ordered for takeout. The layout and vibrancy of the vegetables almost forces them to remove anything that doesn't look fresh, so what you get is something that depicts a satisfying meal.  0.5 stars docked due to the only issue I had, which was that the chicken was moderately dry. Though, they do provide complimentary miso soup to help wash it down.  Waited about 10 minutes behind 3 other dishes. Luckily, they have newspapers around (or someone left it there?), in case you don't have your phone and have to awkwardly stare at the staff the entire time."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! A long line up and a bit of a wait at lunch time.. but that usually indicates something worth waiting for.. and it was.  I tried the chicken bibimbop and was impressed with the quality and authenticity of the ingredients. (I lived in Korea for a few years and had this dish there often). It had a good variety of vegetables and dark-meat chicken, with a center scoop of rice, delicious red spicy-sweet sauce on the side, and an egg perfectly fried so that the center is just a bit runny to mix with the rice and veggies. Delicious!   The rice is really nice.. and I'm not a big rice fan, but Bob's seems high quality and the unique stickier texture and grain type just like I remember it was in Korea.   There are less than 10 seats inside, it's pretty tiny, but has a nice, clean looking atmosphere and friendly staff. It actually looks much nicer inside than the outside sign would indicate! Take out is probably a good bet.   Someone near me had the beef bulgogi noodles and the portion looked enormous and it smelled fantastic! Trying that one next time."}
{"text":"I just love the spicy beef bulgogi on rice... tender beef in a spicy bulgogi sauce (also available in a milder version that is sweeter) fried up with veggies, onions, peppers, carrots, mushrooms and served on top of rice or noodles, with a light sprinkle of sesame seeds.  I always get it to go because the eat in area is very small.    I have never been able to pick up for dinner, only lunch or late lunch.  So if you see the hours listed as open until 7 pm, make sure to call first, any time I have called close to 5 they were closing soon.    Also, they changed the name to Surasang, but we fans still call it Bob's Bulgogi, so don't get confused if they answer the phone Surasang when you place your order in advance to pick up."}
{"text":"In the midst of the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto, Bob's Bulgogi hides on a side street in a very un-assuming and modest location.  The place is very small and can only seat about 8 people. Whether you eat here or not doesn't matter though, as the real draw is the awesome food coming out of the kitchen.   Per the name, Bulgogi is the special here. I had an order with shrimp and it was excellent. Just the right amount of spice, delicious shrimp and a pretty generous portion overall. I was also one of the lucky few able to eat onsite. I sat at a table facing the kitchen.  The place can get jam packed at lunch time as you can imagine, so getting here a little before or after the lunch rush can make all the difference. Either way, you're in for a delicious and authentic meal."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and so I decided to come here after lunch hour to try this place out. At that time, I think they ran out of free miso soup, from what I read in the reviews that they usually give out. When I went there, there were no customers so I ordered right away. I got the spicy bulgogi with rice and had to wait around 10-15 minutes to make which could mean that they make the food to order during that time. The food come piping hot and I devoured it within minutes. It was a splendid portion, the bulgogi was not that spicy and also it was enough to fill me up for the day. Service was also quick and friendly though I did not really interact with them as much."}
{"text":"Hidden just east of the busy financial district at the intersection of Victoria & Richmond streets, Bob's Bulgogi is a rare gem that serves up delicious bulgogi to those who are lucky enough to be in the know.  It's quite small in here, so don't plan on dining in unless one of the four seats is available. Two are bar stool style and the other two are somewhat cramped benches at the front window. Aside from that small inconvenience, it's a dope takeout spot.  Must-try items: Any Bulgogi dish  The Bulgogi is as good as you'd expect it to be. I recommend the spicy beef. There's no doubt that I'll have everything on the menu before too long. Prices aren't too steep either, considering the portion sizes. They play hiphop, R&B and trap music which may catch you off guard. It didn't bother me at all. Definitely a dope little gem on the east side of downtown."}
{"text":"Small and homey that's what I describe Bob's Bulgogi.  If you do decide to stay, there are these 2 small tables that can barely fit 2 comfortably! Don't bring your date here.. or maybe you should if you want to be close to enough other?!  Beef Bulgogi ($6.95) cooked right in front of you when ordered does smell good. I like how it is served on a real plate! Portion is decent for the price.  Deco is quite neat with dark interior and funky keepsakes all around.  Bob's Bulgogi is definitely A-OK if you have a snack attack in the area!"}
{"text":"It's a take-out kind of place, so don't expect much from service, even though they're friendly. Beef Bulgogi is very tasty and portion was good enough to make me super full! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've came here since time. Before the remodel and before the old man (dad?) gave up the place. Back then, the portions were slightly bigger, the sauce, slightly sweeter. They never gave a lot of rice but it seems like now they really don't like to give out carbs. The udon is a good alternative but sometimes, you just want meat, sauce, and white rice. Speaking of the sauce, I'm not sure what it is but it's a bit different now. I still come here from time to time, only because the smell of the food is amazing and it lures me in at lunchtime."}
{"text":"very popular korean take out restaurant in the heart of toronto downtown. Smell so Good when I lined up outside"}
{"text":"This place without a doubt, smells delicious when you walk by or open the door.  Its a little hidden, so you may miss it if you're not looking.  I think the portion size is good - not great.  It's placed into a styrofoam container with rice on 1 half, and the meat and veggies on the other.  It was very, very underwhelming and did not have enough sauce. Ended up trying it twice, and still unfortunately underwhelming.    The \"mild\" has absolute no spice at all whatsoever - maybe the Spicy version has a little extra kick to it to take the flavour to the next level?  It's NOT easy to get to if you're driving, so be sure you can walk over. They also are very busy during the lunch rush, so be prepared to wait 15 minutes plus if you go at that time.   Also... *they have this weird lining inside the styrofoam and I don't like it - it sticks to the food. *there is extremely minimal seating inside *it is similar to a Teriyaki dish - but this is a Korean version  PS: was so hungry, I forgot to take a picture."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Bob's Bulgogi by a friend.   The food is delicious and a good portion size. I usually can only eat half and save the rest for later.   This place is popular and is pretty busy at lunch time and sometimes the line is out the door. I try and go before noon and after 1 pm to avoid the rush. You generally get your food within 10 minutes.   The place is small and has seating for about 4 people by the windows.  There are barstools too,  but during busy hours people waiting for their food take up that space."}
{"text":"Food 4/5. tasty and good. fresh. portions not big. somehow they really shy on rice. why?  Service 3/5: friendly, polite,  not the bests poken English language, asking to tips for take out.   Location 5/5:  right near side walk at central street.   Price 3/5: $$ for quantity of food.   will be back."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent prices. Nothing spectacular, but there's really nothing similar in the area. I consistently come back here for lunch because like I said - decent food and decent prices.  The spicy beef bulgogi with noodles is my fave; I had the bibimbap once and it was awful. Don't get it. Trust me.  Comes with miso soup on the side, but you have to get it yourself.  Good idea to call 15 min in advance and pre-order so you are only going to pick up. Limited seating."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I'm not a Korean food connoisseur.  However, when I walked in here the first thing that came to mind was \"Wow - it is really nice to find a slice of authenticity in the thick of the business district!\"  The bulgogi was perfect, loved the sweet sauce on it.  I was so tempted to try the seafood pancake but didn't get to because my portion was already heaping.    Prices are quite reasonable (my bulgogi, vegetables and rice was $8.95) and there is even free miso/seaweed soup.  The people behind the counter are also friendly as heck.    Just wish they had more seating."}
{"text":"I keep coming here, simply can't resist the bimimbap. These guys are consistent and getting busier! 12-1 is pretty hectic but if you come later you can easily eat here, which is a great experience. However I wish they brought back the K-pop music videos!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy beef Bulgogi noodles on their recommendation. It was good food albeit a bit pricy for what you get (tons of noodles, not a lot of beef) but good spice and flavour. Glad I tried it but it won't be a regular thing... Bit too greasy!"}
