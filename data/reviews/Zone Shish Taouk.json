{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident as a hungry tourist looking for a lunch option other than Tim Horton's. Situated next to Tim Horton's this Mediterranean Cafe has it all: plates, pita wraps of Shawarma (beef) or chicken. I was going to order a falafel pita, but the cook recommended the chicken. I've learned not to argue with the cook, and it was good advice! A LARGE serving  of Shish Taouk was placed in a pita with accompaniments. The case filled with salads was so enticing that I opted for side salads, both very fresh and delicious. They have a children's menu as well. This is a find...fresh, fast food at very reasonable prices. The dining area was surprisingly upscale and comfortable! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a try I live shawarma and Mediterranean food but this was three out of five for me the portion was very small the sandwich had very little vegetables and it's too expensive for the price will not be coming back here the food was okay but too expensive for small portions"}
{"text":"So convenient for tourists to stop by en route to Montreal or Vermont. Very delicious food!"}
