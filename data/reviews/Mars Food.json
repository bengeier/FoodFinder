{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp and unfortunately it's a bad one. Been to Mars for breakfast many times over the past few years, but this last time was the first since the change in management. To put it bluntly, breakfast was terrible. Under-seasoned hashbrowns, hollandaise with chunks of flour, soft poached eggs verging on raw, and watery coffee. I am not a picky person, but I have basic standards! It was so bad I just want to forget the entire experience ever happened. Prices went up and quality went down. Sad to see a place with so much character go down this way. For the sake of the historical relevance of this place, I hope they make a turnaround. Though safe to say, I won't be returning back."}
{"text":"Mars knows their niche, they stick to it, and they do it well. This is neither fine dine dining nor extremely tasty food but it's consistent. We were looking for a cheap, diner-style breakfast the other day and Mars fit the bill perfectly. The pancakes were fine, my eggs were cooked perfectly, and I loved the fact that they use real potatoes for their home fries rather than some processed, frozen, reconstituted garbage that so many places seem to use these days. The fact that a lady in a traditional diner-style uniform was our server added the kitschy charm we were looking for. I'll go back to Mars the next time I'm too lazy to make breakfast at home, but it's nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Fantastic...old school Canadian traditional fare, a little run down perhaps but, the food is outstanding"}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy my breakfast here, I really did. But it was impossible. From the waitress in sweatpants who was eating at the bar the whole time who didn't bring me the coffee I ordered, I had to get up and ask her for it(despite our table of 2 being the ONLY ones in the restaurant) to watching the cook microwave the 'hollandaise sauce' (if you can call it that-it was runny and tasted quite bad) to waiting longer for the bill than it took to receive and eat my luke-warm meal (again, only table there!) $7.95 in the end is really not cheap enough to make up for the poorly prepared and tasting food, or the lack of basic service. There are far better greasy spoons in Toronto, much better breakfast, and places just as, if not cheaper. Boom, on college for example. I will not return."}
{"text":"Mars is lovable because of the ancient staff, visible in the wall portraits and on some mornings; the affordable diner prices (as opposed to chi chi pseudo diner inflated prices); the atmosphere; the burgers; the availability of versht with standard breakfast; the corn muffins (raptures); the milkshakes and the location and hours.
People who deny the tastiness of Mars cuisine either haven't had a Mars burger or are unable to taste the authentic greasy goodness of a diner breakfast served at less than $7 all inclusive, because they think you get what you pay for. At Mars, you don't; you get ever so much more."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to Mars.  The place has been around for ages and it is one of the few diners left.  It's quite small and a large group would not fit in there comfortably.  

The food is served super-duper fast and the price is so reasonable.  My boyfriend and I will breakfast there on weekends and whenever we crave the occassional hamburger, Mars is the go-to place.  

They have a great hamburger and french fries combo for around $5.50.  Super tasty!  They also have flap-jacks, aka pancakes, that are really yummy and I'm into their coleslaw as well.

Greasy.  Yes.  Good.  Yes.  Greasy and good!"}
{"text":"A great little diner with quick and friendly service. I had french toast, sausage, and coffee. It was good, not great, but the prices weren't bad at all. Definitely check it out if you're a diner fan!"}
{"text":"When I think of greasy spoons in Toronto, Mars is always first to come to mind.

It was of course the prototypical 'American-style' I took friends to, when they were visiting from England.

Mars also serves fantastic cornmeal muffins. Notable for their fine-grained texture, these are a too rare delicacy I have never encountered anywhere else.

The one drawback of the place is its size: tiny! But a stellar establishment in the realm of greasy home-cooked food, nonetheless."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

Came here after the wait at nearby Aunties and Uncles was about to drive me berserk. I was ravenously hungry, tired, annoyed at the system in the previous establishment and drained after a shockingly long TTC streetcar journey. Almost anything would have sufficed.

That doesn't take away from the fact that this is a more than adequate greasy spoon diner. The portions are big, the prices are cheap, the menu is quite diverse for the type of place it is. The food itself is fine.

I had the Mars Platter. French toast, a pancake, fruit, and eggs done any style. 'Twas nice, nothing was the freshest (except the coffee, yay!) but I enjoyed my meal nonetheless. It sufficed in quelling my hunger and improving my mood.

The service was bizarre. Our waitress seemed completely out of it. She didn't seem to understand what we were ordering even when we pointed to the menu. Lots of minor mistakes were made, and then we had to wait fifteen minutes for our change to be brought to us. We eventually walked up to the till and requested our change from the waitress who was very flustered by our request. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume this was a genuine error and she wasn't trying to pocket a 45% tip...

This place is fine but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. There are better greasy spoons in Toronto - try Jim's Restaurant in Leslieville!"}
{"text":"When you are not drunk this place is 2 stars.

When you are drunk and hungry in the College/Bathurst area, this place R-O-C-K-S and is 4 stars.

Thus, I give it a 3 star average.

Do not go unless you's drunk."}
{"text":"Mars food is one of the best restaurants. This is a typical old style restaurant and for those who miss the old fashion diners than this is the place for you. The thing that I love about this restaurant is that it's an all day breakfast restaurant. They have the best meals, the menu contains a variety of items, the service is excellent and best of all the food taste very delicious! 

The menu has changed into something completely amazing. Their weekly specials are amazing I remember once I ordered a special french toast with marshmallows and it felt like heaven when I was eating it. Their prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! Their homemade muffins are everyone's favorite, you can't go to mars without tasting their amazing muffins."}
{"text":"Maybe the greasiest breakfast I've had in the city. Rivals Vesta lunch on Dupont for atmosphere. 

Long row of diner stools against the bar, and maybe 8 tables / booths in the place.

For about $8 you can have a really weighted breakfast - pancake, sausages, bacon, homefries, egg, and coffee.  The food isn't amazing or even that good - but no denying the charm of this place. The avg staff age is aprx 72. 

Right across from Sneaky Dee's (and open 24hrs on the weekend) - it's a good spot to grab weekend brunch when you're hungover and don't want to wait in line...because there won't be one.

I guess that means I'll be back."}
{"text":"Uniquement pour celles et ceux qui ont une méchante gueule de bois et qui ne se soucient guère de leur taux de cholestérol par un dimanche matin."}
{"text":"A simple and fun place to have a diner style breakfast. Fast, friendly, efficient service with appropriately delicious (diner style!) food. Don't expect the moon but you'll walk out satisfied.

Old school design provide some charm."}
{"text":"We were looking for pancakes and french fries for lunch today and was happy to spot Mars while on the hunt.

My daughter ate every bite of her kids pancake & bacon plate  ($6 including milk or OJ).  I would normally order a BLT at a diner but decided to go for the chicken club instead.  My expectations were low because most places put out dry chicken breast with ease but honestly, it was actually quite juicy and overall a well layered sandwich. The bacon was good - not too crispy but most definitely cooked on a flat top (as opposed to say, the microwave).   My fries were not very good - cooked way too long they tasted mostly like greasy potato ash.  For real, I am an easy french fry fan to please, so it pained me to leave so many uneaten on my plate.

The biggest surprise of the visit though was the Raisin Bran Muffin BAKED TO ORDER.  I noticed the menu boasted of their 'famous muffin recipe from 1951' (or sometime in the mid-century) . A longstanding 'famous muffin' in Toronto that I have never heard of before?  I gotta give it a go.  Thought we would have it while we waited for our meals, but when the muffin still hadn't arrived by the time we were nearly done our lunches, I thought they forgot about it.  Then our server asked if I wanted butter on the muffin.  Oh! Okay, muffin is still a go.  I let him know we would take it to go.  It wasn't until I picked it up to leave did I realize that it was still warm.  Like fresh out of the oven warm!
When I commented, our kind server looked at me like I was a bit foolish for thinking it would be any other way.  But really.  Have you ever had a muffin baked fresh for you on the spot at a diner before?  If yes, then it was probably at Mars.   I ate half while it was still warm, and the other half at room temp for an evening snack, delicious on both occasions!  It tasted like something my grandfather would have made, so I assume it had good ol' molasses in it.  

Overall great diner experience, and Mars has been added to the roster.  Next time I will sit at the counter to watch the magic happen."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced food (went for their breakfast) ordered the waffles and eggs come with bacon and breakfast sausages. The eggs were requested sunny side up but was a tad bit under done, everything else was pretty good. Service was great no problems and they got free WiFi. Overall? place has a nice atmosphere and and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I pretty much agree with the 2 and 3 star reviews above.  The only point I'll add is this - there are probably only 2 reasons to go to Mars at this location.  

First, you've never been there before, and want to be able to say you have. The second is you haven't been for 25 years and want a quick hit of nostalgia.  It pains me to say it, because I have fond memories of this place, but there are dozens of other diners in Toronto equal to or better than this one."}
{"text":"yummy chicken club sandwich! perfect fries.
super cute retro diner.
attentive service.
i wanna come back and try their milkshake!"}
{"text":"One Star for the service, I cannot give any good feedback on the food, sorry. I had a burger. Fries are bad, steak are made with bleach, bread is cheap and vegetables remain vegetables.
And it will cost you as much as a good Burger.
You better be drunk and starved to go there."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of 50's style greasy spoon, the decor, the booth's the cramped pace with the stools at the counter really define it. 

The food is pretty good considering the type of place it is, this place always provides VERY fast service, and a decent breakfast. Don't expect anything fancy here. 

The homefries are really good, the servings are ample and the quality is good considering the type of place it is. The coffee however is pretty awful lol.  

It's a high volume place because of it's lightening fast service too so if you want a place to sit around and chat after your meal, or if you want better presentation and decor, then you may want to look elsewhere. This again is a classic Family run 50's style diner so don't expect anything mind blowing here, just cheap, fast food here.

Edit: I have learned that the service, quality and cleanliness here has suffered greatly since the new owners took over this summer, so approach with caution lol"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a casual bite. Don't come here for an extravagant experience, come for  a hunger fix. Service is overally chill so come when u have time to kill. It's a classic greasy spoon. You get huge portions for an incredibly reasonable price. My only thing is the coffee isn't bottomless and usually these types of place are classic for that. You do that one free refill and they let me take it to go which was decent of them. It is standard brew, nothing fancy so I personally think it should be atleast unl. Refills."}
{"text":"A decent greasy spoon that serves breakfast all day.

I had smoked salmon & avocado eggs benedict. I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs, and while the hollandaise was good, I found the dish underseasoned overall. I appreciate the homemade smashed hash browns. I do appreciate that there is a wide variety of food on the menu, and the service was efficient and friendly. Coffee's came in at $2."}
{"text":"After about six months of living in the neighbourhood, I decided to try Mars Food despite all the mixed reviews. Having lived around Avenue Open Kitchen before this, I had understandably high expectations. The place was pretty empty, and the service was quick and friendly. The meal itself left something to be desired. 

The Jump Start breakfast was about $7.50 and included two eggs any style, toast, seasonal fruit and home fries. Eggs were fine, toast was small and not really that toasted, seasonal fruit was three thin slices of kiwi, and the home fries were half great, half giant chunks of pretty raw potato.

Maybe there's a better order to get here, but what should be more reliable than a simple breakfast at a diner?"}
{"text":"Canadians are just like us. They like diner food and home fries for breakfast. If you're facing down the piercing cold wind off of Lake Ontario and are still waiting for your car rental before heading out to Viagra Falls this diner is a decent place to go. The service was good and the food was filling but he coffees were small and the salmon on my benny was a bit fishy. Overall good place though."}
{"text":"Throwback to the diners of old. Unfortunately they've left everything back there as well. Standard greasy food diner with an old Greek guy manning the grill. The diner has a nostalgic feel but it's because it probably hasn't had any upgrading in the  last 40 years. My omelette was burnt which prompted me to write the review. I can live with the  bathroom that's in need of some major TLC and the ancient decor (there is a huge difference between retro and just plain old) as long as you are producing quality food. I will say the staff was friendly and the food came quick so if low end greasy spoon is what you're looking for......this is the place"}
{"text":"A great brunch place for lazy (hungover) mornings where you sleep in and wake up starving. It's a cozy diner that's relatively cheap, though prices did go up from when I went during the summer. 

It has all the breakfast comfort foods you could ask for. My favourite is the waffles combo that includes a waffle, 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, and fruit for just under $15. Their bacon, egg, and cheese bagel is pretty good too. The food comes quickly and the service is always friendly. 

It has a 50's diner vibe with an open kitchen. If you're expecting a nice, aesthetic, instagrammable brunch, this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Mars is pretty much the definition of a greasy spoon. They serve all your basic breakfast foods along with burgers and other sandwiches. You can get a decent breakfast here for not a whole lot of money. The service is generally good. The food here is not outstanding at all, but it's not bad either. 

The best thing about Mars is that it is open 24 hours on the weekend. Perfect for an after drinking meal. Unless it's 3 am though there are better places to get diner type food within walking distance. Still Mars serves a purpose and is good at what it does."}
{"text":"It's 3am on a weekend, and you have a drunken craving for Steak & Eggs? Well you're in luck, as this place can make that happen.

The place is the definition of old school greasy spoon, where you'll feel like you're stepping a couple decades into the past with its interior and diner simplicity. But the food is decent and pretty cheap. It's not a great experience or memorable meal, but the place serves a purpose and has some retro charm which makes me not dislike coming here."}
{"text":"Childhood spot of mine (related to the former owners in fact!). I have warm memories of coming by to grab muffins and playing in a big freezer downstairs. 

Unfortunate to see that the management change has meant a change in quality, too. I haven't been in years.

For what it's worth, it's walls are thick with Toronto history. Come for the breakfast food (seriously do not order anything else, it will not be good), stay for the atmosphere of an an increasingly forgotten working-class Toronto."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that Mars, the \"Muffin King since 1951,\" remains a College Street staple and serves a perfectly fine breakfast.  But apart from this, I thought it was pretty unremarkable.

Yeah, the breakfast was fine, standard and inexpensive.  It's always good to know a spot where that can be depended upon.  I like the fact thet they still have those 1930s milkshake blenders.  But othewise, you know, meh.

No, wait.  There was one remarkable thing.  The length of time I had to wait for my check."}
{"text":"This is another Toronto landmark that is better in your memories than it is day to day.  It's like a '45 Chevy pickup; nostalgic, and will get you where you are going but you won't enjoy the ride.  The quality here has been in steady decline for a long time, and It's time they changed the oil. Don't let them rest on their laurels.  If you are heading here, hit the brakes. The neighbourhood evolved leaving this place far behind."}
{"text":"I have been to the Mars at Yonge and Eglinton many years ago for brunch, but this was my first time at the location - supposedly the original Mars. 

This is your classic greasy spoon diner and certainly looks the part. However, it does not have the dirty / grimy feel that you may typically associate with a diner. It has bar seating along the left side where you can clearly see the cooks preparing your meal fresh to order and there are tables along the right hand side with a few booths at the back.

I arrived around 11:45, and while the restaurant was not packed, it was certainly busy and I was told to seat myself. 

The menu is quite broad with all of your typical greasy spoon / diner options, and they seem quite willing to accommodate any special requests. I like that you can ask for pretty much anything on the side, for example a single pancake or a single slice of French toast - no problem!

I ordered a fresh fruit plate with a side of rye toast and my friend ordered a more typical diner meal of eggs over easy with home fries, toast, bacon, and an order of French toast on the side. The fresh fruit plate consisted of a sliced banana, a few orange slices, a chopped gala apple, and some grapes. The grapes weren't the freshest, but I was still satisfied.

Service was fairly bare because there was only one waitress serving the entire place, but she was very pleasant and was happy to answer any questions we had. They forgot to give my friend maple syrup for his French toast, and when we asked for it she apologized and brought it right away.

Overall I would return, but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip to go here."}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not spend your money here. 
I've been here a few times but at my last visit, I vowed never to give business to this disgusting, racist establishment. I'm Chinese and I was there with my other half Chinese friend. We ordered poutines,  which by the way are prepared by tossing cold fries and cheese curds in the microwave in styrofoam containers. So when we received our chemical contaminated food the man said \"The forks are over there.\" I didn't quite process the information in time so I said \"Sorry?\" to which he replied, \"The forks are over there, we ain't got no chopsticks here!\". I'm absolutely disgusted by the way we were treated. Please, there's so many other nice restaurants on this street, go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"A great diner. Had the corned beef hash today and everything about it was just right. The hash was flavourful, well-balanced and just generally tasty, the egg was cooked just right, the toast wasn't too dry, and the hash browns were made from real potatoes. The food is nothing fancy, but everything they do they do just right."}
{"text":"Seems to have had a change of management. Didn't see the elderly gentleman who was always there cooking and the lady who worked the cash. 

The menu has been updated and the price increased by a small percentage. However, meals now come with fresh fruit (on my last visit, orange slices and pineapple). The food is still cooked the same way, so no complaints. 

The waitress seemed new and a little overwhelmed. She forgot water for our table and the table beside us even though the diner was only 1/3 full (~5 seated tables). However, she was polite and came around to ask us if our food was all right."}
{"text":"I was at Mars yesterday at 7 am for breakfast. I don't know how many times I have been there since my first visit as a teenager  since 1952. I keep coming back and am never disappointed. Bacon and perfect sunny side up eggs with a Toronto rarity, perfect home fries without that chemical/stored overnight or seasoned salt taste.
Those who claim it is less than tasty must be coming from some booze party and have destroyed their taste buds with anti freeze.
Mars is only about 10 feet wide and long like a bowling alley. It is shopworn but clean and cozy. The decor is perfect.
The staff is pleasant and efficient. The cook can really cook.
There is only one flaw.  I find it charming. Although the name is Mars, their logo is Saturn. Note the rings. To be fair, I don't want an astronomer or astrologer cooking my food.
I hope Mars continues in orbit for at least another 60 years,"}
{"text":"Not a bad little diner. Perfect location and nice diner look, it felt like an old timey diner. You can see the cook cooking everything about a foot away from you which is guy. The cook is an older guy, super friendly. It was pretty full when I got in but the food still came in minutes it was pretty sweet. Menu is nice and prices are pretty good compared to most breakfast places. 
I had pancakes, French toast, bacon and an egg. It was a small portion but filling enough. Food was all pretty standard but the pancakes were a bit undercooked. 
Service was quick and friendly but the servers weren't very talkative. 
All in all it was cheap, pretty tasty and quick. A very nice quick bite kinda place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mars on College for my entire life. My mother went to U of T and she got breakfast here regularly, and 30 years later, so do I. I'm giving it 5 stars, but there are some things you need to know when you go to Mars:

1) Mars is a diner. It is for breakfast foods. There are non-breakfast foods on the menu - do not be fooled! You should not buy a hamburger here, and you should definitely not buy a steak here. This is a place where you can get eggs, pancakes, french toast, corned beef hash, and perhaps a sandwich of some type (BLT?) but I wouldn't stretch it much beyond that. Order breakfast, regardless of time of day. 

2) To be more precise, Mars is a greasy spoon. Come here with an appetite for greasy food. This is not a place to eat healthy. The ingredients are not local or organic. The coffee is not fair trade. The maple syrup is not real. This is not how your mom would cook. The food is bad for you and it is delicious. 

3) If you require service, go and get it. Serving staff will leave you in peace until you bother them. Mars doesn't really have \"service\" - go ask the server if you need something and they'll get it for you. 

4) Having said all that, Mars is great and I hope it never closes. It is cheap, it is ludicrously fast (I don't think 5 minutes have ever lapsed between ordering and first bite in the 20 years I've been coming here) and it is consistent. Nothing has changed at Mars on College since it opened in 1951 - certainly not any of the decor. Sit at the counter and watch the cook make your food. He's been there several decades and knows exactly how long each of the pancake, bacon, toast and egg will take to cook on his flattop and will start them all in sequence so they finish all at once. It's fun. Order the corned beef hash - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A classic! Don't expect anything fancy, like shade grown, fair trade pour over coffee, or cage free eggs and 7 grain bread; but if you like Diners and great food at a fair price, squeeze into a 2 top along the East wall, order a bottle of Molson, and dig into perfectly cooked bacon and the best home fries around. 

Fast Food the way it's meant to be: with the emphasis on Food!"}
{"text":"I genuinely liked this place at first. I went in during a time that wasn't so busy and really got a feel for the atmosphere and the food. The quality of the food was standard for a breakfast place; I can say that it was nothing special. The decor was old and had a very run down feel to it, not necessarily a retro feel, more like an overused VCR. Yet there was something about this place that I liked. The cooks genuinely knew what they were doing with the techniques they used and the way the food was handled; like a skilled barber. 

Then today I went in hoping to get something quick during my hour lunch. I waked in and found a handful of people eating their meals. The moment I walked in I could hear a harsh tone and pungent voice speaking to the cook: \"you have to do things quicker\" & \"Stop messing up the order\". I casually sat down and the same person that was talking to the cook approached me with a completely changed demeanor. For the next 30 minutes I witnessed this women, who turned out to own the restaurant, speak to her staff in the most heart retching, derogatory manner. This cook brushed off her comments with charm and pose; he would just whistle and cook the food diplomatically.

Customer service is not just the immediate interaction with paying customers. I personally believe the way staff are treated make a world of a difference in the success of the business. I can understand that serving people may be a very challenging line of work but if this person can talk to her staff, in front of customers, the way she did then there is no way I will be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"Hangover heaven! 

Mars Food knows why you're there at noon on Saturday. They know you're hungover as hell, and they want to make you feel better. 

I called in advance to make sure they had a table for us, and once we got there it was ready. It's such a charming older place - it looks like it hasn't been changed at all since the 50s when it opened. 

As soon as we were seated, two giant pitchers of ice water appeared for us. I ordered off the basic breakfast menu - 2 eggs, bacon, home fries and toast. It was around $5.50, and while nothing special, it was exactly what I needed. 

A few in our group ordered poutine, and it was made with real cheese curds! The milkshakes also looked divine. 

The only things to note are that:

A) Their coffee kind of sucks and it is not included with the breakfast - adds about $1.50 to your bill. 

B) Jam doesn't come with your toast. I was too busy eating to ask for it, but it seems like something that would have cost extra. 

Definitely worth hitting up to get you out of hangover hell!"}
{"text":"Yeah, we're talking 50s diner.  Before the food places opened up near the Western Hospital, it was probably the \"closest\" place to eat.  We're talking comfort food.  Light on ambience; heavy on service (?), this place has been around for eons.  As has most of the staff! Just want food?  Few diners can match its approach to life.

But there has been a change in management and some things have changed.    Some have not:  whatever you do, don't eat the hashbrowns!

Then the bug crawled out of the salad ... thank gawd it wasn't mine ....."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Mars on occasion because very few places in this town do all-day breakfast, but always knew it was kind of low-quality food and I would never take another person there.

However, I just ate there today again for the first time in a year and WOW it has dramatically improved. The new sandwich section is a HUGE improvement over what was there before.

I had the steak sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised to find it on a homemade foccacia bun. The only bread I've ever seen there before was white or brown from No Frills. It was seasoned with horseradish mustard, sauteed veggies, and was a great sandwich all-around. The other lunch choice was a turkey club and I saw it being delivered to a table; it looked awesome. 

Best of all I got the 50% off lunch special so it was only $5.50 + tax. What?! What has happened at Mars, I wonder. The girl who rang me up said they are trying to improve the menu (for what I am sure is the first time in 20 years.) 

So if you have written off Mars, give it another shot. The interior is still kind of gross (think American luncheonette with none of the charm) but I hope this is the start of a turnaround so they can echo the rapid changes on College St. while still keeping the same low prices."}
{"text":"Mars has seen better days -- in the last ten years the cast of characters behind the counter has changed and the food has taken a turn downwards. I've had to give up on the grand slam breakfast because the pancakes now taste like they're right of a premix box. Once, they were very good, light and fluffy.

But if you want a pretty good diner breakfast centred around bacon, eggs and home fries, plus decent corn muffins, there's still a place for Mars."}
{"text":"Really short review coming at you! I'm gonna be honest here...Mars is only useful to me because it's open 24 hours on weekends. And when I'm craving some greasy food at 3 am, this little classic diner is my saviour. 

But I don't so much enjoy this place sober. I'm not sure if it's just me, but sometimes I get a weird twilight zone vibe from the staff and just in general. But, for what it is, Mars is great. And the milkshakes are delicious and the breakfast is cheap!"}
{"text":"Flawless beauty from Red. Zebra print decor. And cheap, simple breakfast. And it's right next to Nirvana and sneaks so that's sayin summin."}
{"text":"Mars is the greasiest spoon around. It's cute in how authentic of a diner it is, it is dreary in how authentic it is, it is unhealthy, it is quiet, it is conveniently located, and on the weekends it is 24 hours.

I'll admit that the one time I ate there I wasn't exactly in a proper state of mind, but after dancing at the Boat in Kensington for a few hours, it was the perfect fix for my drunken evening. Whatever I ordered was vegetarian and delicious. I probably got grilled cheese and a milkshake.

I know someone who swears by their French toast. I suppose it's better than swearing on your mother's grave, eh?

PS Did you know that there is a Mars uptown? 2363 Yonge St at Eglinton. It's much bigger."}
{"text":"Let's open this review with a Yelpy cliché, shall we...

How have I never reviewed Mars Food before?! 

Seriously, though, how the hell have I missed sharing my love of Mars Food. I've loved this diner for over a decade, and these booths have seen me through lots of things. Different boys, eventually a man, meals with my mom and eventually my own kiddo. If these walls could talk, they could tell you some stories about this lil' mama martian. 

My two favourite Mars Food memories, one old one new:
+My mom once accidentally tipped her pin when she wasn't wearing her reading glasses. That's four digits, folks. The line cook chased her down the street and she was instantly refunded, but to this day it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen go down at College and Bathurst 
+My toddler woke up at 7am per uge, but I had no food in the house. Turns out Mars is on Uber Eats. Eggs Benedict delivery? Why the hell not...

All of the sillily named giant breakfast plates will do. If you like diners, Mars Food is one, so you'll probably be happy."}
