{"text":"We went to their branch on finch ave in Etobicoke. They are scamming ppl. They told us things were on sale (its even advertised on the front of the shop) but when we paid they had charged us regular price for everything.  When we pointed out to the \"manager\" he tried to tell me that the price has gone up. Very unethical....its no different than stealing."}
{"text":"I had only heard about this place not too long ago and having lived in the area for so many years I was eager to give it a try.   Needless to say, that this was my first and last time that I will ever go there again.  I was the only one customer there when I entered, I ordered the $7.99 two meat combo..I was told to wait 10 min (I guess to make the naan and to reheat the food?)   When I got home and opened my container I was sooo shocked with the portion size....it was so little food.....literally there were two tiny pieces of chicken (butter chicken) and one piece of beef (beef curry) it was so dissapointing, as I've had a lot more food at other near by places for less price and also way much better quality....the only thing about this meal that was good was the naan bread and that's all!   Everything in the store is over priced....from their hot sauces, to the selection of foods in the freezer section.  I will not be returning to this place, it seems like they like to take your money and give you half empty plastic containers to take home. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Had the special chicken briyani. Not impressed at all. All rice barely enough chicken. Didn't even finish it. Threw most of it away"}
{"text":"The Butter chicken,  and rice , naan bread all from their catering service was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place - delicous chicken biryani, chicken samosa and love the butter chicken! Perfect for take out :) we also regularly get the marinated meat - perfect for grilling! Our fave: jalepeno chicken!"}
{"text":"We ordered few things for lunch today but were not impressed. The goat curry in the Thali special with 2 meat for $7.99 had gone bad, butter chicken was ok, the portion of the rice was very small, not sure what was the mint sauce for, the salad was not fresh, the naan was burned, portion was small for what you paid for. The rice of the Chicken biryani was ok, but for some reason they buried two small pieces of chicken at the bottom of the container, so you needed to eat most of the rice before you can get to the chicken and the chicken was not overly fresh as well. I was there around 12:15 for lunch, waited 15 mins for them to preheat the food , I was the only customer there, Half of the display was empty and the hot table was empty with only couple sauces in there, not sure if that was a good sign."}
{"text":"Well!!  If you have to trust a desi foody who loves Biryani to it's heart, then people this place has the right taste, quantity and expection of how ah damn Biryani should be. I have travelled to an extend of 100 kms to get the best taste of a Biryani, but somtimes you come off disappointed I discovered that Warrich Foods Markham has the best Biryani not just  in town, city or Provinçe.The Lamb or chicken biryani just melts  in your mouth..       best Biryani   .      , owner   !! He is a very good guy. Best Biryani I have enjoyed since 1996."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Went to this place to pick up marinated chicken for a bbq. After reading the reviews I was a bit weary. But went anyway. This review is based solely on marinated chicken, chicken Briyani and fish pakora.  The poultry was marinated in a variety of flavours- tandoori, non spicy tandoori, afghani tikka, lemon spicy, jalapeño, mint chicken and etc. the price for each flavour varied but was at 3.99-4.99 a pound. It was reasonable and tasted good when grilled.  Chicken Briyani was okay - big chicken pieces. Fish pakora was okay too.  I wouldn't come here to get curries and take out though. However it seems reasonable priced for that and the flavours are decent.   It's worth checking it out for chicken and things you want to put on the grill! It's not really just a restaurant - it's a meat and take out place too!!"}
{"text":"I heard that it's insulting to ask an Indian chef to \"tone down the heat\" in vindaloo, so I guess I should feel insulted for getting chicken vindaloo that was toned down without my permission? The vindaloo was heavy on salt and tomato paste but lacks the sharp spiciness that I'm used to. It's A-OK for takeout, not comparable to proper sit-down Indian food, and undoubtedly not something the chef would cook for himself."}
{"text":"Staple for marinated meats in Toronto. Large, clean and very good tasting meat!"}
{"text":"I love their butter chicken specially with fresh made garlic naan (they alway made it fresh when you order). Very generous chicken chunks in it. The sauce is to die for. I always use naan to scoop every tiny bit of it from the container. Don't wanna waste any drop! We also bought fresh marinated meat from there. Afghani chicken , lemon chicken are my favorites!Pop them in the oven for 30 mins. Dinner is ready instantly. I like how convenient it is. The meat selection is big in the store. I can't wait for the summer to come so we can fire up our grill for some bbq! I am glad this place is open in our neighbourhood. It is exactly what we needed. Great price with good quality."}
{"text":"We come here every so often since it's close by. We come for cooked foods, never the marinated raw foods.   Butter Chicken: Small portion for a high price. Not much meat, not much sauce. It's tastier than most places, but for the price, wouldn't buy again (fooled me 3x!) 3/5  Chilli Chicken: Very different take at chilli chicken. Also small portions and much sweeter than expected. Would not order again though 3/5  Fish Pakora: Buy 1lb get 1lb - it seems to always be the deal and we LOVE it. Definitely the saving grace. Very crispy when you eat it right away. Comes with this green sauce that is pretty spicy once you drench your Pakora! 4/5  Chicken Biryani: Buy 1 get 1 free - has been the deal. Purchased it twice because it was an easy meal to order for a small gathering. The rice comes with one or two pieces of drumstick. Rice is OK on the first day. After that, it gets hard and dry. Have had better Biryani 2.5/5"}
{"text":"I visited twice and my first visit was much more enjoyable; the second visit, not so much at all.  My first visit was in mid October and asked if I could place an order right at their opening hours and they happily fulfilled the order of butter chicken. Portions were alright and the taste was good  Today though, as their official grand opening, they had in-store flyers and flyers distributed in mailboxes showing some of their grand opening promotions. One promotion was their fish pakora. It was buy 1 lb get 1 lb free. When I got home, I felt that the container was quite light and proceeded to weigh it (with the container); the weight came up to ~500g. So I thought maybe they were supposed to hand me 2 boxes or something so I called them up. The man that answered the phone said it's actually just 1 box, and it's buy 1 lb get 0.5 lb free. I told him it said otherwise on the promotional flyer and he just hung up on me.  I also ordered chicken curry. Taste was alright, but for the price, the portions were tiny."}
{"text":"Was having an impromptu BBQ so thought we'd check it out to get marinated meat. The selection was great. Tons of varieties for both spice and non-spice lovers. We decided to try out a couple things, including Jalapeno, Afghani, and Tandoori Chicken, along with unmarinated lamb chops and Chicken Kebabs. The kebabs were definitely my favourite! They were already half way cooked so took no time at all on the BBQ.   The store itself was full of surprises. Other than just the butcher side, they also had ready made food and a variety of snacks, drinks, and other food items.   The staff was helpful with making recommendations and service was really quick.   Overall, would definitely go again for the kebabs!"}
{"text":"We are from States. My whole family tried butter chicken,Nihari, chicken shish Kabab and the biryani on special - 2 for $10 and kheer for dessert. They gave us an amazing customer service and the food was delicious. I highly recommend to try it!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for delicious curries and naan! I got take out for the Beef Nihari - tender brisket with good amount of spice, Butter Chicken - good flavor, very orange & bright coloured, side of Small Rice (which is more than enough for 3+ people), and 3 pieces of plain naan. Total came to about $30. Kind of on the pricey side but taste is good.    TIP: Order in advance to avoid the wait. They cook it fresh on the spot so it took around 15 minutes wait.   Parking in this plaza is horrible (weeknight around 7pm). I don't know who designed it... there are way too few spots for the amount of stores here, including a Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch or take out samosas.  For this visit we had pre-ordered 4 dozen samosas (2 veggie 2 beef) for a birthday party.  They opened late due to weather but had them ready soon after the requested time.  And they are absolutely delicious.  Served with a spicy mint chutney.    They have uncooked marinated meats, cooked individual meals, and a limited variety of Pakistani/Indian groceries. Even though we don't eat meat, it all looked authentic and fresh.  They have a few vegetarian options. Regardless, good place to check out.  It's in the small plaza with the RBC next to the new condo towers at Markham Rd and 16th."}
{"text":"Looking for that Brampton style meat store/take out place? This is the closest thing you'll find.   Technically this place has 11 locations across Canada with a bunch in the GTA. It's a popular concept where you buy marinated Indian meats for bbq, home cooking, etc. But they also have take out for you to order and this place is jo different. They have all of the staples available to order including naan, butter chicken, tikka masala, goat curry and paneer dishes.   It's made for the days you're not looking to cook or you want some take out to supplement your cooking. Pricing is a little up there on a meat per pound basis and take out, but cheaper than other Indian take out restaurants close by. Cheaper than Ambiyan which is more fine dining/bistro style and India's Taste which is too far if you live in North Markham/Stouffville area this isn't bad.   Would come back. Giving it a 3.5 out of 5. Rounded down to 3."}
{"text":"Great place for some great food! Love their garlic naan - as another poster mentioned, always made fresh on order.  Also tried their butter chicken based on some reviews and it did not disappoint! The chicken was lovely, big and juicy! The naan worked well to make sure that I didn't waste any of this delicious dish. Their veggie samosas are pretty good, very large and tasty but you'll occasionally come across a pocket of coriander seeds which is a little...overwhelming? The beef ones are completely different while still good, but much smaller. Chana Masala is standard and I wish it was a little hotter when you get it for take out but I guess that's what my microwave is for!  I'd like to try one of their marinated meats one of these days, but for now their take out will do."}
{"text":"I got the lunch thali and it was an excellent price for what you're getting. It was just $8.99. You get a meat curry, rice, raita, gulab jamun, another Curry and salad...AND a drink ANNNND a naan.   It could always be your lunch plus some more for later.  This place is also cool because they sell lots of fresh raw seasoned Meats. All you have to do is take it home and throw it in the oven.  I will return here again and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"All the food  contains a lot of chiles! I'm all for flavour and spices , but excessive red chili powder just destroys everything . The boneless biriani is really good. The marinated meats have the same issue way too hot. If you like your food very hot then this is the place for you otherwise the cooked curries are all the same with excessive oil and chili for no reason."}
{"text":"This place offers pre-marinaded meats as well as cooked food. I haven't tried the cooked food as yet so I can't comment on that.  They have quite a selection for pre-marinaded meats: chicken wings, drumsticks, chicken cubes , lamb, salmon etc. Meats are charged by the pound; price is a bit expensive but it's the convenience that you are paying for and you can choose however much quantity you want."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst indian food I've had in the GTA. The daal was way too spicy and the biryani had no flavour. Will not return.   I'm a bit surprised given warraich meat's reputation."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the overall ratings of its place is so low...  I went in for the butcher shop part of the store; I know the place also has a takeout menu. I was specifically looking for chicken.  I'd say overall they have an excellent section of meats, and marinated chicken with various sauces. I got the tandoori chicken (which is dark meat chicken in tandoori sauce), it was supposed to be not spicy...although i found it a little spicy it was still really good. I also got the afghan chicken which marinated in a white but sauce, this was really nice!  I did have to try their naan bread too, and was pleasantly surprised. For $1.50 you get a huge piece of fresh naan.   Overall the place looked very clean and organized. The staff at the counter were very friendly, pleasant, and helpful! I will defiantly go back for more chicken. I really want to try the mint chicken next time I go in, it looked so good!"}
