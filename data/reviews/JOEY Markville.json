{"text":"Great dinner on Sunday night. Nice atmosphere as they had opened up access to the patio, so you felt like you were on a patio even though sitting inside. Food and service was good. Had a large chicken salad which was delicious. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food is always good and always consistent. The service is ok, depending on who I get."}
{"text":"We went in a group of 6 and ordered the following...  Steak and sushi (3l Chicken and ribs Spicy chicken sandwich Some salad with berries and chicken  For dessert...  Happy ending Apple pie Chocolate cake  And several drinks as well.   To be honest, food was not that good.  Steak was bad, sushi was ok, chicken sandwich looked dry and the salad... well,  looked like a salad (hard to mess that up).    Desserts were a bit better.  Not a big fan of Apple pie but, that was the best of the three.  The happy ending had a funny salty sweet taste to it.  The chocolate cake was ok, nothing exciting about that.  Price was more expensive than other places.  Will I come back...  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Ordered cheeseburger sliders, average at best...Meat was dry and tasteless..Also ordered Bombay Chicken Curry, which was more like vegetable curry as there was a distinct lack of chicken...Not impressed.."}
{"text":"It was fine. I guess. The food was good. The service was excellent. The portions were on the small size. Why does this chain exist? I paid $20 for the ahi tuna club with yam frites. Come on. It was good. Just not $20 good! My girlfriend had a $13 glass of wine. Just a single glass, not a half litre. These are Toronto prices, in Markham. There are so many amazing non-chain restaurants nearby. Can't say I see any reason to return."}
{"text":"Out with the old, in with the new; Grace restaurant has come and gone, and now Joey has the spotlight.  Love the wicker patio furniture and the kitschy interior d√©cor reminds me of an old Chinese tea shop with an odd edge to it.    But then, they have this large wine list, with few wines by the glass that confuse me - if you want to have a lavish wine list make it accessible.  Some of the dishes seemed mismatched and unbalanced: maybe I expect too much.  Come for the patio, foot traffic and something new.  I wouldn't focus on the menu too much."}
{"text":"We love joeys! Whenever we have our dates joeys is the choice! We get the filet mignon medium rare and get them to put butter on the top- trust me it brings out the flavour and makes it taste AMAZING. The best steak I've ever had hands down, Better then the octagon! So if you order steak take my advice, you won't be disappointed and you'll love me for telling you to do it haha!  Not to mention their mashed potatoes are amazing so cute and yummy! Love this place , always fresh and high quality. Better then other joeys locations ( Yorkdale, don mills) ! We Always come here :)"}
{"text":"My last visit at Joey's is rather disappointing! Had to wait for an hour to get a table and no one came to serve us after we were seated. And when we get inside, we found out there were actually a plenty of tables available, but the receptionists were holding the tables for people on the waitlist who didn't answer the phone call! This is really unprofessional! Food quality had also got worse! Just like fast-food quality tbh. Nah maybe popeyes chicken wrings are even better and no need to wait for hours!!!"}
{"text":"Why do ppl compare Joey's to Pickle Barrel?  Of course Joey's is better, it is a up scale version. Higher end chain classier theme.  Both are from the same corporation, the food at Joey's isn't any greater then PB. It's all about the atmosphere that make chain restaurants food taste the way you want it to be. If everything in the kitchen is done from scratch..(not prepackaged) it's worth reviewing. Food 3/5 Service 2/5"}
{"text":"4.5 for Great service 3.5 for food 2.5 for prices 4 for decor  I'm hoping the food gets better over time. It's not bad, but for $50 pp meal, it has to be better.   Definitely agree with other reviewers to make reservations early, or drop in early to put your name on the list.   Usually lounge seating available at 6 pm (i.e. before the mall closes and hoards of people decide to try JOEYs). We waited ~45 minutes for a table in the dining area. Once seated, we were fairly comfortable. Noise wasn't an issue for us.   The revolving door is a nice touch to keep the cold air out... if people would use it!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Joeys in Markville because all the other Joeys told us they have a 50 yo 90 minute wait.  We still had to wait but it was a bit less time . It was 30 minutes.  The hostess service was a bit clumsy because they must be new at this , they were courteous.   We sat at the bar area . Our server was not too prompt to get our water ..  We ordered sliders for appetizer and ordered fish tacos and toasted grill cheese with lobster sandwich and a side order of Caesar salad.   The appetizer was good ..a bit heap on the potato chips.  The fish tacos was okay but the grilled cheese sandwich was horrible,  Sadly it was salty and we could not finish eating it.  The Caesar salad is a scam because it is the size of a 4 oz bowl. It was $8 dollars and it had not Bacon bits or Parmesan slice. It was salty and soggy.   After the food was dropped off, we did not see our server.  Maybe because we don't drink alcohol, we get bad service.  It was a Busy Friday night but joeys at york dale or don mills are much better.  We observed that another table had much better service.  Maybe they think Asians don't tip but what happened to equality of service. We tip according to service. So their tip is the average 15% .  Our server never asked whether we want dessert, we got the bill after we ate and left.   Overall, bad expensive food with mediocre service.   I will wait at yorkdale and don mills any time"}
{"text":"Always very busy, but the online reservation system is really nice. The food is so so good especially the herb crushed salmon and the chicken wing appetizers. Service was quite good fast and efficient etc."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time with a few friends. Food was bland, over priced and very small portions for the price you pay. We also ends up with three servers for some reason, all three of them asking us the same questions. Quite annoying!!  First, and now definitely the last time stopping here for a meal."}
{"text":"So this restaurant is awesome.  great atmosphere, great drinks and great food.  However, my gf and I both got sick afterwards.  3 days later colleagues went and 2 out of the 4 became sick.  I really loved my sushi and steak and the crispy spring roll mashed potatoes are awesome but it just did not end well!  The service is OK.  Our waitress left me thirsty a few times for too long.  There was also an issue with my girlfriends food but it was quickly taken care of."}
{"text":"There is basically NO service today. Pretty disappointed  to the staff especially Jessica. We have to wait every time we order or ask for something. No one bother to come and ask if our food are okay. The lettuce wrap was quite salty, consider its not appropriate for customer who has high blood pressure."}
{"text":"Finally I came here with a friend for our Saturday lunch today. It happened to have a NBA playoffs game Raptors vs Pacers on the TV.  Almost everyone in the restaurant was watching the playoffs game and actually, it really made exciting and better for the environment. We ordered one California chicken burger (on Portuguese bun) with house salad and one hand pressed burger with Caesar salad. The food came out really good, tasty and flavorful. Especially, the house salad was above our expectation - yummy with lots of roasted almonds. We also had one cappuccino at the end and it made the meal completed. We really enjoyed the time here and will definitely come back to try other items..."}
{"text":"Always came here with families to enjoy their steak. This time we ordered BBQ salmon rice, it was sweet and sour one, a little bit spicy but mixed together very delicious. Cesar salad with yum fries match so good as well. Service was friendly as always, will recommend to folks."}
{"text":"Visited on Feb 15 for a 7pm reservation.  We were seated promptly with a server attending to us within minutes of being seated.  Service was excellent,  decour was splendid,  food was superb,  bathrooms clean,  and to top it off manager Melissa sat with us for a few minutes conversing with us to get our thoughts on the service among other things.  Waiting area was packed.... My suggestion is if you plan on visiting make a reservation to avoid lengthy wait times.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5. Reason for the score being slightly below perfect is that our server gave us the wrong description for a meal.  To her credit she realised before us finalising our order.  Apart from that slight hiccup Sasha (server)  was great and gave excellent suggestions for dessert.  Her suggestions for dessert was very exciting to the palate..... We are still smiling"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place sucks.   I've been to the JOEY'S in downtown and it can't compared. The dishes were lukewarm and the tacos were drenched in salt. We had to drink two cups of water just from that dish!   My friend got so sick after eating their pasta. She spent all night in the washroom!  Luckily, I had only had a little bit of the pasta since it lacked flavor. I felt like the pasta was steamed in oil and the tomatoes and arugula were just decorations. There were hardly any pieces of chicken.  And they called it Chicken Tatalligate The kitchen needs to improve on their plating speed too. I watched the guy let our food just sit there.   It certainly wasn't worth the price I paid for .We were better off at a hk style cafe or even PICKLE BARREL. I was extremely disappointed. I guess if I ever decide to go to Joey's again, it will be the one near EATONS."}
{"text":"My friends and I waited 30 minutes for a seat even though we had made reservations! Other than that everything was fine. The service was good and so was the food."}
{"text":"Not a bad Joeys location. Though there is no entrance directly from mall so you have to exit mall to enter from the parking lot entrance. Wasn't too busy during dinner time so there was no wait for us :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants ever hands down. Always like the atmosphere when I come here and the service is top notch. Food is always amazing can never go wrong when u order something from here food is always cooked right and tastes great. Excellent job guys keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Came in here a few times to have some drinks and light snacks at the bar.  What I really like about the bar is they served a single king cube with my scotch.  The bar is also smack in the middle of the restaurant which is cool.  Service was a bit slow because there were many serving staff coming in and out of the bar area and it looked a little busy.  Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"Overall : 3.5 stars for consistent experience with food, nice decor, staff and drinks. I've been coming back over the course of a few years when I'm in the area.   Food: Call me boring, but if I find food that is consistently decent, I prefer to go for the same thing. My usual go-to consists of their \"Sandwiches and Burgers\" menu. They used to have a lobster grill cheese that was really good. I don't see it on the menu anymore (please bring it back).   Ahi Tuna Club is probably my favourite. I request switching out the sweet pepper relish for spicy mayo. It comes with a side of skinny fries. I've had this countless times and it's mostly really good. Sometimes it's on the fishy side, but that's not always the case.   I can speak to the fish tacos, butcher sandwich (aka beef dip) and burgers as well. They are quite good. The highlights for me with the sandwiches are the ample amount of protein. I'm always full after the meal.   Service: I've had good experiences with the staff here. If you let them know you're crunched for time at lunch, they usually do their best accommodate your needs. The waitresses are conversational and try to make you feel welcome.   Parking: Parking is usually ample, but I avoid parking too close to Wal-mart as that side tends to be hectic. Obviously Markville gets really busy on weekends and evenings, so account for that."}
{"text":"We made a Monday night 7:30pm reservation for 10 people to catch up with a good friend visiting from overseas. To our surprise when we arrived, we were told that there is only one table that can seat a group that size, and the previous group were taking their time. Figuring we would wait, we squished into a booth meant for 6.   Around 8:30pm, the manager finally came to tell us that normal procedure for a group of 10 was to split the group into two tables close by- one for 6, one for 4. This was not communicated to us on the phone while making the reservation, and we would probably have reconsidered JOEY if we had known.   Finally around 8:45pm, the previous group left and we were able to be seated at the one large table. We were told that the restaurant cannot control how long customers stay (the previous group had been there since 5:30pm), but it would have been appreciated if we had known about the table limitations in the restaurant prior to arriving.  The food was alright- good, but nothing special. We were also told a few much-loved items (the ahi tuna club!) on the menu had been taken off by head office, which was another huge disappointment for the night.  We would probably consider JOEY again, but for no group bigger than 6!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I sometimes come here on Friday or Saturday nights and there is always a slight wait (usually about 20-25 mins). We got here at around 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and waited about 20 minutes for a table. They're usually really good with handing out sample drinks or appetizers for people waiting, so the time passes quickly!   We ordered their \"Hot Wings\" as an appetizer ($12.75) which is dressed with Frank's hot sauce & comes with a blue cheese dipping sauce. The wings are super tasty & not too spicy in my opinion.   Next my boyfriend ordered a California Chicken Sandwich ($16.50) and I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos ($15.75). My boyfriend said his dish was good (came out a little greasier than I expected), but said the fries were closer to McDonald's fries which is a slight disappointment given that it is supposed be a \"classier\" chain restaurant. My fish tacos however were really good, the shrimp, fish, guacamole, & cheddar cheese all went together scrumptiously. Highly recommend. (I've had their Ahi Tuni Salad before as well and would say the tacos were better and more worth the price). Although the tacos don't come with a side I found them to be super filling by itself.   All in all, Joey Markville is a pretty good & consistent chain for me. The only complaint I would have is that some of their food is overpriced for what it is, but I guess you're also paying for the ambience, etc... The service was good & pretty fast. 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, loved the atmosphere and the service was fantastic! Had the California chicken sandwich, delicious! Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"This place just has a great way of disappointing me, over and over again.   The food is mediocre. There's really nothing else to say about it. The food at the other Joey locations are better.   As for the service.. anyone who has been here can attest to the hair pulling, drive you nuts lack of service. However, if you come with a man who looks like he has money to spend.. you'll get decent but annoying service.   I have come on several occasions with women and every single time I get the same terrible service. It takes half an hour for a girl to come and bat her eyelashes at me. She spends five minutes telling you how your order is amazing and how it has some magical ingredients. Cool, go put my order in. Then she pulls a magic trick and disappears for an hour leaving your food at the window. When you FINALLY get your food.. they forget something crucial like cutlery or an accompanying sauce. You then have to go on a mission to track down one of her friends to get it for you. Finally, you eat and another hour goes by and she's no where to be found. When you finally track someone down to pay your bill, she magically reappears! She tries to make you feel like she hasn't deserted you and cares for you to get a big fat tip and rolls her eyes in anger if you give her the nothing (or little to nothing, i'm not cruel) she deserves.    If you come with a man who looks like he has money, get wait to see another side of these women. They will flirt, upsell, compliment and talk just about anything to make you think you're her number one customer. She will spend all of her time checking up on you and refilling your drinks and telling you how awesome your table is and eventually she will come with the bill and compliment you more in hopes that you'll give up your lifesavings because she is pretty and you're a man.. and obviously a fool.   Maybe I am too harsh. I can't generalize for the whole restaurant..  but hey.. I have been there a lot and had this happen every time.   This is not worth spending your money on. Even Pickle Barrel is better."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and really awesome foods. It is pricy but worth every pennies. Any Ahi tuna dishes are excellent. The tuna fish is so fresh and it does not leave you any bad fishie taste. I also recommend their veggie burger + yam fries. I was highly surprised by how good it taste. I tried alot of veggie burgers (Toronto) and this one has a good ranking.  The patty  has this beautiful favour, and texture. I heard that this place is always pack, but it was not too crazy when I went (Sunday night). I want to give complement to all female waitresses. It is part of their uniform to wear heels on job.  They have to bear all the pain to serve us. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time for lunch with my boyfriend and I thought that food that we had was very good but that the service was absolutely horrible . We asked three different waitresses to bring vinegar for the fries and some water and both did not arrive . We were thirsty while eating and the lack of water was frustrating . I will be willing to give this place one more shot I oh because I enjoyed the flavors of my curry  bowl so much but if the service is anything like it was today I will never go again."}
{"text":"So for some reason, I ended up going to this location 4 times in approximately a week's time with different people and each time I was impressed.   The first time I went was for lunch with my coworker on New Year's Eve. We were seated promptly and service was fast and friendly. She had white wine and I had the summer sangria to drink (which was amazing, btw). She had the sashimi salad which she raved about. I didn't have any because I'm not a fan of raw fish but it actually looked delicious. I had the lobster grilled cheese. It was nice a cheesy with chunks of lobster in it. Of course the dishes were presented nicely.   I went back again that night on a double date. We were told the wait was approximately an hour, only ended up waiting 30 minutes, which was a bonus. To start we had the gyozas and sweet potato fries both of which we enjoyed very much. I loved the sauce that came with the sweet potato fries and the cheese that was on top. Everything was cooked perfectly and despite it being busy, everything came promptly. For entrees, I had the CAB sirloin and my bf had the salmon. Both were cooked perfectly, presentation was flawless. The one thing I didn't enjoy was the crispy mashed potatoes that came with the dish. It just wasn't my thing. I wouldn't mind eating it but I personally prefer regular mashed potatoes. For dessert we had the \"Happy Ending\" (and we had fun joking with the waitress about the name and going on with that pun). It was very small but decadent. I thought it was perfect for my bf and I since we were quite full but still wanted dessert but it's really for one person. At the end of the night, we finished paying and it was getting quite close to midnight (COUNTDOWN TIME!!); there were approx. 15 minutes left. Our waitress told us that if we wanted to wait, they were doing a champagne toast to ring in the new year, which we did. I thought that was a very nice gesture.  The third time I went, it was with a friend and we got hungry after shopping. We had the calamari to share. The calamari was nice and hot when it came out. It had some vegetable tempura as well as the calamari so that was a plus. Then I had the soup and salad (nothing to rave about, it's soup and salad but the soup was very good) and she had the ahi tuna tacos (which she raved about). We had to sit at the bar this time because it was so busy and we didn't want to wait but the service was still fast and amazing.   Finally, the last time I went with just my bf for drinks, apps and dessert. Since I already commented on the calamari and sweet potato fries I'm gonna skip straight to dessert: Baked to Order Apple Pie. WOW! It was so good. It was literally baked to order as it was still hot when it came out. It had real apples and it wasn't too sweet. I do recommend asking for the ice cream on the side rather than on the pie so it doesn't melt too quickly over the pie, but that's just my preference.  Overall, all my experiences have been great; no complaints. It is very busy though so if you go there, do expect to wait a little for your table. I've been to the Shops at Don Mills and the Eaton Centre location and found that those are a hit or a miss. Markville has been most consistent out of them all in terms of food and service. With different waitresses every time, the service was still fantastic."}
{"text":"Kinda over priced for what you get. I kinda expected to get some sides like a salad with my main course when it cost like $20. Got nothing and the portion size was kinda small. If they made it bigger or added a salad/soup/side, it would have seemed okay. But the way it is, it's over priced. It didn't even really taste all that good. It was just average food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a weekday. The lobster grilled cheese was amazing. I was expecting to get a few sprinkles of lobster but it was stuffed with large chunks of lobster."}
{"text":"We had been at JOEY Markville few times, very easy to find a close parking, enjoying the food & the atmosphere there. This weekend we went for a late dinner, it was packed, but the food again was great as always, hot & freshly prepared  (not like some other restaurants who just heating a precooked food)...   But this time we got an exceptionally great service, our host was a young sweet lady - Kelsey & she was fast & very friendly, she knew the menu very well & gave my wife a great choice to try this time, the rotisserie chicken, that ends up to be a good choice, was so juicy & tender. I like it even more as the portion was too big for my wife so she asked me to try a nice portion :) & I love it too.  Was hard to order a draft beer that I never tried before, she offered me a small tasting sample & told me that in her opinion it was a bit bitter than the bottled one, and she was right, so went back to the kind I love. That's a service that I want to get at any other bar or restaurant, cheers to JOEY & their service & to Kelsey for being a great host."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfirends and a baby for lunch. Great service at sitting us to a big booth that allowed me to park my stroller and sit comfortably. The waitress patiently waited for us to settle in since we have the baby. Super Baby friendly location. It's roomy and lots of space. This may be because I went there for lunch and it's less busy. The food is in same quality as the Don mills yorkdale and DT joeys. Although at the end of the meal the waitress no longer swing by to fill our water...  but other than that its pretty good. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this chain, so got a chance to try it out. Went for lunch and the menu is mix of sandwiches, burgers, steaks, Asian fusion dishes and typical appz. Ordered the French dip and it was pretty good. The sushi roll and steak combo was very disappointing. The rice was still raw and the steak was small and low grade. Didn't expect to be good at this type of resto but it was awful, even compared to supermarket sushi.   Service was fine but rough on the execution. Maybe cuz it just opened and poorly trained by manager. Staff who came from other locations were fine."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews are ridiculous. Joey has done their research so the menu here reflects the demographic of Markham so you will see a lot of Asian fusion dishes. Love the twist on the surf and turf. Their desserts are incredible, I am addicted to their apple pie, and their creative mixed drinks. I recommend the sangria. I've been here many times and the food is consistently top rate. You can't go wrong with the steak combos and the fish taco meal. The service is excellent and the staff are enthusiastic, professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Love the room A wide open concept that is classic with a touch of fun. We sat in the lounge and truly enjoyed the seating and the quality of the furnishing. Food was a little slow but of good quality and somewhat unique. The Beers on tap are of a good variety. The only thing that I was surprised with was the overall price."}
{"text":"Holly and Alex, the most fantastic friggin server and hostess combo ever made possible, a match made in heaven! Came here to celebrate a special occasion for a very close friend of mine and Alex and Holly took the best care of us ever possible! Treated our entire party with the upmost care and passion any living human can ever ask for. Got the favorite Ahi Tuna sandwich and tasted fantastic as always! The Japanese gyozo appetizer was delicious with the sauce, and it was just an overall amazing experience at Joey's Markham that I'll never forget. The atmosphere was superb, and Joey's Markville will be the location I will ever come to in the future. Alex and Holly, if you're reading this, I know I keep mentioning your names but you two were absolutely amazing and no amount of words can ever express to you both how grateful I am for the highest level of care tonight. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We were pleasantly greeted and attended to immediately.  We went at 6:00pm so luckily was able to get a table.  However, by 1/2 later, patrons had to wait for a table.  The food was OK.  We started off with the calamari appetizer.  This was good.  The pieces were really tiny though.  It was more like 'popcorn' calamari.  I had the BBQ Salmon Rice Bowl.  The flavour was good enough, however, it was swimming in sauce.  Another on the table had the steak which was ordered medium well.  It came medium rare, so had to be sent back.  It came back medium but it was left at that.  The third person had the taco sushi.  This was good, however really small.  The place was really loud, between the patron noise and the music, it was hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were there for my birthday tonight and overall it was okay. But because of certain circumstances, I don't want come back... Would be 3.5-4 stars...   At the end of dinner, they brought out a dessert for me that said happy birthday on it. It was the butterscotch thing, it was too rich and the texture and flavour wasn't my cup of tea so I didn't end up eating it. I also wasn't up for dessert at that point but it was nice. However at the end of the night, they had added the dessert to my boyfriend's bill. My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal about it on my birthday so we left it. But with that, I don't think I would come back to the restaurant. It's the principle of the thing. If we were going to pay for it, I would've preferred to pick for my dessert. No one at the table had asked for it either. So it was very frustrating to see that happen. I've never been charged for a birthday dessert at any restaurant ever...   Service: 4/5 My reservation was for 13 and at 6:30, my party wasn't completely there until 7:30 and they were very patient about it. I apologized several times, and they assured me it was no issue. The only thing was the wait took a while but we did get all the food at once so it wasn't that bad. They were considerate and very friendly.  Food: 3.5/5 For the food, it's nothing special but it's tasty for what you get. After eating there multiple times, the menu is pretty decent. It's good for a chain restaurant. Things are generally well seasoned, a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I love the Joey chain of restaurants.  Joey Markville is great EXCEPT when they get busy. Thurs-Sat not the evenings to go. A number of times we've waited and waited for service and then waited and waited again for our bill.  On \"non-busy\" nights the experience is different, staff are consistently attentive."}
{"text":"Great trendy restaurant, especially in summer time you've a nice patio as well as a large portion of the restaurant with exposed roof.  I can't think of any places right now that's similar in away to Joey, it's just different, maybe it's more trendier.  Boston Pizza? The Keg? Kelsey's? Casey's?  No.  The mini burgers, steaks and Spanish Paella were all really good.  The steak may not be at The Keg level but pretty close I'd say.  Maybe I was too hungry but I loved the mini burgers.  It's a got a really nice bar setup, if I remember correctly it goes almost 360.    I'm definitely going back when I get a chance and the price is pretty reasonable.  Plenty of parking since it's located right at Markville Mall.  I went to the Eaton Centre location years back and I remember it wasn't very special but this time and this location, it was great!"}
{"text":"Came here in the summer for a friends cousins birthday, we were a group of 20 or so. We sat in three different tables since there wasn't a table big enough, which was okay and we were in between the patio and indoor seating. Which was amazing since we were indoors but also got a breeze of the nice summer evening wind.  The food was awesome. Some of us ordered the chicken Alfredo linguine, but only half got chicken on there's because the server messed up our order. However without chicken the Alfredo was still good.  That's the reason I gave this place 4 stars because the server could not accommodate a group order efficiently. The sweet potato fries were addicting. Definitely going back but to a different location."}
{"text":"This is a good place to dine after long day shopping as this restaurant just located inside the mall, the food and services was excellent, we ordered twice of the garlic shrimp, very comfortable booth and nice decoe, will go back."}
{"text":"very disappointed with this location. i've been to the other joey's locations in downtown toronto, shops at don mills AND in yorkdale. this location is the worse of them all.   first, i'm pretty sure they're short-staffed. our server took forever to greet us and give us menus. he was quicker to take our orders, but i think there was also kitchen staff shortage. i dined with 3 others, all of whom ordered the ahi tuna club. it took him quite a long time to come back to tell us that the kitchen was ALL OUT of the the ahi tuna. one of the diners came here specifically to eat the ahi tuna club, and so we were quite disappointed.   it took a long time for our food to come out. our server flagged to the manager that we were quite disgruntled, so the manager comped us a free dessert. ONE DESSERT...FOR 4 PEOPLE. we ordered the apple pie and we each had 2 whole bites.   the only reason i was at joeys in markham in the first place was because markham is quite limited in terms of full-service dining (in my opinion), but now that i've had this less-than-pleasant experience at joeys, i will 100% not be returning."}
{"text":"I never really have high expectations for anything that's a franchise that serves upscale Canadian (New) food (read: Moxie's, Milestones, etc.).  However, JOEY definitely exceeded my expectations! The prices were right and everything I tried was really good. Sat on the patio, great atmosphere, great service.  I came here on a Monday evening and there was ample seating with no wait time. I ordered the baja fish tacos and my friend ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo. Both were delicious! I never order fettuccine alfredo at non-Italian restaurants, but my friend's dish was really good! Pasta tasted fresh and it was creamy and delicious. My fish tacos were well balanced with guac, some hot sauce, and really good fresh tortillas!  For dessert we shared the molten chocolate cake. Also really warm and delicious and combined well with fresh raspberries and vanilla bean ice cream.  I would come back here!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing and food even better. If you are looking for something quick, but don't want to compromise on quality this is your place!"}
{"text":"I went to JOEYs on November 30th, during black Friday. I  always went to Joey's Yorkdale location, so I was really happy to hear that there was one opening close to where I live. However, I was disappointed with the food quality at this location.  I normally order the Ahi Tuna club sandwich and my fish was cold and really not as enjoyable compared to the Yorkdale location. My friend ordered the French Dip and it was Meh. However, on the positive side, the garden salad was amazing and super delicious, and the staffs were definitely nice and awesome! I'll give it another try, but I'm pretty sure that I will not return to this location... I'm sticking to Joey's in Yorkdale."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food. Fun place to hang out. They were super sweet for my little boy. That always scores extra points :) Food was delicious. I had the chicken peanut salad. Yum"}
{"text":"Our fav spot for date night! Sushi and steak is our go to! Their apple pie with maple ice cream is so good! Cocktails are great here, one of my fav is the elderflower Collins. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"We recently try our dinner at this location and find it has better food and service than shops at don mills.  My son and husband ordered the New York steak and they were very impressed with quality of the meat, tender and juicy.  I had the butter chicken which I find delicious.  And my daughter tried their burger with yam fries and she enjoyed it.  We also tried their apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  It was good but we find it a bit too sweet for us.  This is our first time here and for sure we will be back and try others on menu."}
{"text":"What can I say, Joey's does it again. They take a relatively simple menu and make it a great experience.  How you ask?  Amazing service, great environment, cool sound track and well amazing staff.   We were seated out on the patio on a beautiful evening. Started with glasses of the Tawse Rose.  I highly recommend it if you haven't already tried. One of the best summertime patio drinks.   Starter was the Mezze Plate. Nice mixture of hummus, feta , tzaziki , olives and pita chips.   Great way to start.   Then had the Lobster Grilled Cheese. Another pleaser.   I always like coming here never lets me down.   Go now, with a whole bunch of people. Eat , drink  and be merry!"}
{"text":"Great small portion of fushion food including steak and sushi. Patio is available for summer times. Good place to sit and chill."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants and would avoid at all cost but Joey is actually pretty decent. They have a changing menu and a variety of selection to suit everyone's craving but it's not overwhelming that you can't make a decision.  I got the Ahi Tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries and he got the chicken alfredo. I devoured my entree and washed it all down with an old fashioned (actually two). They make a mean old fashioned.  The wait time was around 40 minutes on a Saturday night but you can sit by the bar (given there are seats) to grab a drink while you wait for them to give you a call. We were entertained by the TV's set up in this area and drank away while watching Raptors and curling.  Staff is definitely nice and always came by the check on us. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I consider Joey's our go-to for a nicer local date night, but have been somewhat disappointed lately.   Last night we had a reservation for 8pm and knew the second we walked in the door that we would not be seated on time- the place was packed. After about a 10-15 min wait (despite the reservation) we were seated at a table directly outside of the kitchen. Not a great setting for the nice dinner we were hoping for. I will say that the service was great, our meals were both delicious, and our waitress was awesome.   Lately it seems that each time we come to Joey's there is some room for improvement. The time before this, our waitress was totally unprofessional, and the time prior to that we waited for our meals upwards of 25 mins. Hoping to see improvement at this location as it really is so convenient and the food quality is consistently good."}
{"text":"I love it here - I know everyone critiques the gorgeous waitresses coming onto their husbands but I've never seen it - I just love the interior decorating / patio/ tvs / most of all the food. Rather shockingly expensive tho !!!!"}
{"text":"Good for a chain restaurant. Came for lunch today.  Staff very friendly and accommodating to us with a toddler. They had a lobster type of clip on chair for my daughter which worked but it's cloth not sure how clean it is.  We started with some torched sushi which we were impressed by and wouldn't have thought its from a chain restaurant.  They had a plain cheese pasta for my picky child which she ate.  I had the crusted salmon which was nice and moist.   My husband had the tacos which he thought was good."}
{"text":"I feel like joey markville is way overrated just because its a chain restaurant very much like the keg or moxie's. Their steak is not that great so i wouldn't recommend it. They did used to have this fettuccine dish that i loved to get as takeout but unfortunately they took it off the menu. If anything, the only thing thats really worth it is their molten lava cake."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great atmosphere, food and drinks.  The bar is big and open so you can go for drinks or sit and eat in the dining room.  We had to wait a few minutes for a table of 2 on a weeknight. Our service was a bit slow, we waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to see us. The manager ended up getting us drinks, but when the server got there she was very nice and pleasant.  I had a sangria and butter chicken to eat- it was amazing! My date had a steak and said it was cooked perfectly.  Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a birthday dinner with my family this year. First off, this place is modern, classy, and downright sexy and they seem to carry this trend over to their hiring. Honestly, it was a little intimidating walking in, so dress appropriately I guess. This surprised me a little because it's attached to Markville Mall and the average mall shopper would probably be underdressed.  The food is plated and presented wonderfully, but didn't match expectation in taste that it created in presentation. I had a rib and roast chicken meal and while the ribs were fine (honestly nothing special though), the chicken and mashed potatoes really underwhelmed. The chicken was flavourless and greasy and the mashed potatoes were bland and boring. Some of my guests had steak meals with the 'crispy mashed potatoes' which looked awesome (think spring rolls filled with mashed potatoes), so why wouldn't these come with the rib combo? Weird.   Anyways, overpriced with an amazing presentation, but not necessarily the substance to match."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night. Place was packed. We sat near the bar. Ambience was like any other chained restaurant that tries to do a classier style of sitting arrangements. The place was loud as there are no carpets or any other sound absorbing materials.  Service was extremely slow. It took forever for the server to come greet us then it took forever for our drinks. Took over 30 minutes for our food to come. This is by far my least favorite joeys.   Food was alright. Nothing special. I ordered a summer salad. It was tasty with just the right amount of all ingredients. Assuming so, since chained restaurants have required measurements of their food. The steak my aunt had was not very seasoned.. Hence the mushroom jus that came with it.   Typical chain owned restaurant type of food. Its probably only so busy because its the only of its kind in that area. If you don't mind the wait and the louder ambience.. Slow service and non attentive servers then feel free to come here for drinks and food."}
{"text":"I never have a bad experience! Always friendly and efficient service. My top menu recommendations: chicken tandoori flatbread, Mezze plate, any of the salads (seriously), rainbow roll, VEGGIE BURGER OMG, lobster grilled cheese!!"}
{"text":"Their reservations system is interesting, as it appears that JOEY doesn't take reservations during certain times. I went into the restaurant at around 5:15pm on a Saturday and asked if I could make a reservation for 6:30pm that evening and was told that that was not possible and to come back then. Not a major issue, but slightly annoying as I expected they would be busy.  When I returned at 6:15, I was informed that the wait was 45 minutes. Thankfully, neither myself nor my girlfriend were super hungry yet, so we were fine with the wait (plus, our friends had not arrived yet). About 15-20 minutes into waiting, a hostess came by and offered us complimentary champagne, which was a very nice touch. I think most people in the waiting area appreciated that.   Sure enough, the wait was a full 45 minutes and we were seated around 7pm. Our table of four ordered the calamari to start and everyone ordered a variety of food. I got the steak and sushi and my girlfriend got the lobster ravioli. Both were tasty. The portion sizes aren't massive, but again, I think that's a good thing. I'm not a huge fan of restaurants cutting up the steak in advance, and the steak was cut into rather thin slices which to me isn't ideal. But it was cooked exactly how I wanted it, so I'll give it a pass. The sushi was surprisingly good.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake and a scoop of their handspun ice cream (sweet and sour cherry). All in all, we all had an enjoyable night.   Their service was really good, our waitress was fantastic. I also find JOEY's prices to be reasonable, for the quality of food you are getting."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner.   Pros: - Nice ambiance  - Fairly quick service  - Professional servers   Cons: - Food was bland  - Pricey for the quantity offered"}
{"text":"The service here was great, however the food was subpar in my honest opinion. Nothing really stood out to me and I ended up going home feeling hungry again not long after leaving."}
{"text":"From a chain restaurant, JOEYs provides more than you can ask for. Good service, classy atmosphere, great appetizers, meals and dessert! 100x Better than pickle barrel!   I've tried some of the rice bowls, curries - but one of my favourite is the ahi tuna club! It's so good, refreshing and light!   Joeys is perfect for small groups. The atmosphere is so modern but loungy. It's great!   The desserts are amazing, if you love citrus try the key lime pie. The apple pie, is AMAZING!!!!!  It does get busy so make a reservation if yah don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Food is good !!!  I love their Ahi tuna salad so much. The dressing was so good i don't know what kind of dressing it was  but it tasted like balsamic vinegar mixed with some other ingredients. It was awesome     The service seriously needs to step up their game though. We had literally nobody serve us for 25minutes. Sitting there hoping to wave someone down felt impossible. Eventually we had a waitress come and take our order. Food took like another 30mins to come. By then it was around 10pm, I was starving from a long day of work hoping to enjoy a delicious meal without the long wait.  Anyway, the sad part was it felt like they were more attentive as soon as we were finished eating like they were so eager for us to leave so they can take their tips.   Overall the food is pretty good but maybe not entirely worth your money.    The service is just crap = made them lose 2stars"}
{"text":"JOEY is still my favourite Canadian chain restaurant, and I'm glad it's moved to the much improved Markville.  It's hard to believe that this restaurant is in a mall parking lot. It's very classy looking on the outside -- there's even a small water feature in front. The inside is also great. It's a very open space framed with huge windows and black brick walls. There's also a number of well-placed TVs throughout the room. This definitely has more of a downtown feel than anything else in the area.  It's also a pretty big restaurant, and by all accounts it fills up every night. Markham -- especially East Markham -- has really been waiting for a restaurant like this for quite some time. Since there are only four JOEYs in the GTA, this is somewhat of a coup for the area.  For drinks, I had the pale ale, which is one of two house beers (the other is gringo cerveza), and I was pretty impressed.    I wasn't extremely hungry, so I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. The patty was tender and juicy and I really liked the cheese they used. It was a great burger all around! My wife had the sashimi tuna salad, and she also enjoyed her meal.   For dessert we shared the \"baked to order\" apple pie with maple ice cream, and thus a four-star review was cemented. It was just fantastic! I guess you would call it an open-faced (?) pie with large chunks of apple. The crust, sauce and apple were just perfect. If you order dessert here, go straight to this dish!  Our server actually recommended the pie and we were very impressed with the service overall. There was always someone to take our order or clear a plate, and all the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the Dundas location a few times in the past. When I recently visited this Markville location, I was disappointed by the revamp of the menu.   After staring at the menu for a bit I decided to just settle for the Tuna Sashimi salad. The portion and the quality of this had not changed and I was satisfied with my meal but I was sad that the ahi tuna club was no longer offered.  Overall still an enjoyable experience and place to catch up with some friends over a meal."}
{"text":"Arrived at Markville Mall for some dinner and noticed the valet parking area in front of the restaurant. It's a busy time of year, I'd hate to bring someone with accessibility issues there. Surprised there isn't a valet drop off and have the valet lot further away. Just sayin.  Happy Hour: I'm not mad at it. Henderson beer for $4! YAAAS!  Dining area is cushy and open. Instead of opaque dividers, they use glass to separate the booths. Servers and hosts were all gorgeous and hilarious.  I had the veggie burger($16), my friend had chicken parm($21) and my other friend had steak frites($23). My friend was said it was the best chicken parm she's ever had. The pasta had a good spicy kick she enjoyed. The steak frites were cooked to order and he got their spring roll mashed potatoes. Apparently, it's really good; my friend with chicken parm was trying to steal it. My veggie burger was OK. Lots of avocado and sprouts, but the patty was mushy, not a ton of flavour. Fries were really good!  For dessert, we ordered the apple pie($9) and the raspberry butterscotch mousse($7). The apple pie was more of an apple danish or funnel cake. Pretty good! The mouse was topped with raspberries and butterscotch cookie that melted in your mouth and then got stuck in your teeth. The cookie was sweet, but the mousse was smooth and had a pie filling at the bottom. It was alright, not sure I'd get it again tho.  Decent food, good service. A successful meal with friends! Reservations recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited this new location after work one evening. I love their establishment so I was excited that one opened up near my job. I was a little turned off prior due to them not accommodating our work holiday party. The manager only called the day of to apologize and ask us to come in but it was too late as we made other arrangements. Not cool.   We were seated promptly on a Monday evening, and the hostess even moved us around to a warmer booth. I wish I could remember our waitress' name because she was phenomenal. She was a young girl with super curly hair. She was cracking jokes with us and was very patient with us taking forever to order.   We had the spinach and artichoke dip to start and it was tasty. Mixing the tomatoes inside gave it a nice kick. I had the kobe meatballs as my main and it was delish. It's always so hard to find places to cater to my love of meatballs with cream sauce as opposed to the tomato sauce. The truffle oil is a bit strong in the pasta. I would also advise going easy on the salt. I love the crispy mashed potatoes and this location gives you two rolls. Melted in my mouth  It was a great experience and I've already returned for lunch. Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Food is really not comparable as the other locations. Ordered Spanish  Paella and got something tasted like fried rice. Service is okay.  The downtown Joey is so much better."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about the restaurant's service and organization.  On Sat. we made a reservation for a party of 10 for the upcoming week.  Lady on the phone said that her manager will call back within 24 hours because they need time to check if room is available.  I've booked in many restaurants before for large parties and I don't mind waiting but 24 hours?  Okay, fine.  Fast forward 24 hours later, no reply.  Approximately 2 days have passed and we gave them a holler.  Apparently they forgot to call us and even gave us the bad news that Friday is all full.  So it took the staff more than 36 hours to realize they had no room and even neglected to give us a call?    I can't give any comments on the food but to receive such poor quality service, count me out on trying Joey's at Markville.  The food court gives better service inside the mall.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Joey's is always a good go-to place I eat whenever I'm not sure where to go with some friends. Usually come for dinner, and hadn't been here for a while, so this was the first time I've been here for lunch.   A little disappointed that their patio wasn't ready yet, as the weather was perfect for it, but it 'was' a little early in the season.  A big fan of the Ahi Tuna here, but hadn't tried the club. My friend and I ended up with the salad and club, and both were amazing the ahi tuna was seared just enough, not over-cooked, and tasted quite fresh.  For drinks, I had the Pimm's Cup today, which is absolutely amazing! If you've never had it, it's definitely worth a try! If you're personally not a fan of that, the sangria here is delicious as well!  Service usually is pretty good. Had good experiences with accommodating servers and friendly hostesses. The problem today was that lunch time was a bit quiet with limited staff. We walked in and took us almost 5 min just to have a hostess come up to speak to us. Not the end of the world..."}
{"text":"The food and service here never seems to disappoint!   Came on a Thursday at 6:15 p.m. Although my friend and I didn't have a reservation, we were quickly seated within 20 minutes (despite it being a full house).   APPETIZER: Yam Fries   The parmesan and salt sprinkled on top of the fries made them a tad bit salty for my preference, but in general, they were crispy and quite delicious - would certainly recommend!  MAIN COURSE: Lettuce Wraps w/ Shrimps   If you want a feel-good and hearty meal, this is it! They provide a small skillet worth of filling for the lettuce wraps, including vegetables, crispy rice noodles, and seasoned shrimp. The sauce was hoisin, making it on the sweeter side of things. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish, and would also recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Joey multiple times, but every visit was at the downtown location. Today is my first visit to the Markham location. First, they don't really take reservations, or if they do, the seats were long gone. We came to the restaurant around 8pm on a Friday night and had to wait for about 30-40 min. I must say that this restaurant is way too popular in Markham, but it deserves the attention because it's only one of its kind in Markham. We weren't the only ones waiting, as they were at least 7 groups of people waiting with us. Though, the positive thing I must say is that the waitress serves you free red wine while you wait. That is a bonus!  As usual, I ordered lobster grilled cheese at Joey. The dish comes with fries, but it costs $2 extra dollar if you replace it with mushroom soup. The lobster grilled cheese was cut into four pieces. The bread was toasted with melted brie and cheddar cheese. The portion is just perfect and I'm already full after finishing my dish. Some people may not find the portion is enough but it really varies with different people's appetite.  The atmosphere mimics the downtown vibe really well. It is almost like a sports bar with fewer TVs compared to the downtown location. There are only two sets of four-TVs. I definitely would like to see more of these kinds of sports-bar restaurants."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Joey's on a Monday and it was relatively quiet.  We were a party of 8 and the hostess gave us a choice of either sitting in a booth or at a high top near the bar.  She recommended the high top because it'll not be as cramped as the booth.  Our server was attentive and constantly refilled out water glasses.  When a couple wanted to share the steak frites, she asked if they wanted the kitchen to put it on two separate plates for them. Nice touch!  The steak was also cooked to perfection!  I had a bacon burger and it was tasty.  The meat wasn't dry, but the bottom bun got a bit soggy.  Their fries were awesome! Make sure you get it!  To end, food was good, service was great!"}
{"text":"The chain itself is a creative combination of culturally exciting food with conformity to modern Canadian preferences. The service and hospitality is never a disappointment and the consistency in beautifully plated dishes are always up to a standard that Joey never compromises. I love the staff at the Markville location and always feel welcomed and attended to. This restaurant is the definition of what a pleasant and fun dining experience should be like."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Joey's. I've been here several times and the food here is always great. The service is really good, too. The waitresses are always super friendly and ensure that everything is just the way you like it.  I really enjoy the sushi and the beef tataki is on point. I can't remember what they call them at the restaurant, but I like to refer to them as \"Asian perogies\" (basically mashed potatoes in spring roll wrappers), are the only thing that I've tried that didn't completely blow me away. I think that my expectations may have been a little too high though. I feel that they could do with a bit more seasoning, as I found them a bit bland, but other than that, everything is really good."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I was excited to try the food. The food was good, but my server wasn't the best. I noticed about 4-5 servers chatting away with the table in front of us. I tried to get a hold of one of their attention to grab our server over, but we were ignored. Overall, I dont think ill ever go back again."}
{"text":"Typical higher end restaurant. I ordered the steak and sushi and we barely full. I think it's a cool chill spot to go for drinks but not so much for a real meal."}
{"text":"Thank goodness.   I guess they have heard the complaints (suggestions).   The ahi tuna club is back!!!!  Stopped in for lunch today.     Was quite happy to see that the ahi tuna club is back on the menu.   Not sure if it was by accident but there were 2 onion rings on it today.   It is what I would consider a classic go to at Joey's.   As usual it was tasty.   I substituted the fries for the mushroom soup.  Although the flavour was good, it was a pity there was only 1 big piece of mushroom (makes it hard to share).  My wife had the hawaiian tuna taco, seems the same as the old ahi tuna tacos.   It would not be enough to make a meal as it is 3 small tacos.   We paired it with a Caesar salad starter, this is very flat (wish I took a picture).  It definitely felt and looked like those free salads u get at a cheap eats place. It does not look like it belongs on the menu.   It was really disappointing.  Oh and as a final note, for those who loved the lobster grilled cheese, that is now off the menu.  Probably with enough complaining they will bring that back too.  Not sure why they keep taking away all my go toos."}
{"text":"Nice retro interior...including the washroom sinks and the foot paddle.  Very pleasant and friendly staff.   Ordered Panang Prawn Curry Bowl, was delicious. Lots of gravy with right portion on rice and veggies. Good flavour. But my buddy who order the Chicken Alfredo couldn't say the same. The Alfredo was hard and chewy.  Can't really comment as this was my first time here..   Will visit again."}
{"text":"Really close to home for me. Conveniently right by the mall. Best deal is their happy hours! Their drinks however tonight were not made well - didnt taste as good as usual which was a diss appointment"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for my girlfriends' and I to catch up and chit-chat while having dinner and drinks.  I love the ambience, food and service of all the Joey's location and because this is close to home, it's an added plus.  Every time I'm here I am immediately greeted by hostesses that are very welcoming and seated immediately without any wait time.  I've came here a couple times and I've never been disappointed.  I like that they have daily drinks specials and that this location has a patio area, which is especially nice during the summer.  I love coming here on Saturdays' as their drinks special for that day is their summer Sangria, which is red wine based (I'm not usually a red wine drinker) but it's the most delicious Sangria I have ever had.  Absolutely a must try!  The last time I came with my girlfriend I ended up getting my usual, Tandoori Chicken Flatbread which is made with chutney, red onion, cilantro, yogurt.  The chicken is always tender with the right amount of sauces and flavours, and surprisingly filling.  This is about the only thing I've ordered from this particular Joey's but I would definitely recommend it, even though it is an appetizer I usually order it as my main course.  I'm waiting until my next visit to Joey's so I can try a different dish.  Overall, I would without question visit this location next time you are in the area or just finished shopping at Markville and need a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Cannot stand this Joey location. Suggest skipping it completely. Gave it a try for lunch TWICE and was disappointed each time. We watched our food sit in the open kitchen and it was cold upon arrival. Daytime management sat on her phone eating while this was all happening. Completely embarrassing for a corporation that claims to have such high standards. Will not return."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant and felt so insulted in my life. This is my second time going to Joey's and my expectations for this place was never high to begin with. It's a Monday night and I can tell it wasn't a particularly busy night.   Food: Spanish paella is not a good dish. Portion wise it was miniscule and had overcooked rice. Flavor profile was lacking entirely which was extremely dissatisfying. Presentation with the peas made it look cheap and not worthy of a 24 dollar price point. Suffice to say I took just a few bites cause I was hungry and set it aside half empty.   I also had the yam fries which is hard to screw up just deep fried yams...   Service: Look I don't go out of my way to antagonize people. But the service was immensely disappointing that it was hands down embarrassing. It's a learning lesson that you should always quality check table and be ready to read cues. Instead however, the waitress inquired about the food of my friend while complete ignoring me and dashing off. (Note this happened again while she cleared my plate and once again never  asked if I enjoyed my food at all)   Server proceeded to sit down at our booth, I assume it's something that they do since the manager said that it's something they do at the restaurant and I don't know there policies. However again, respond to cues, I'm aggravated, last thing I want is for the server to sit down for a casual conversation.  Water top up came at the end of service which trust me took forever to happen.  Never once did I spoke to a floor manager/supervisor during the entire service. Maybe perhaps if they helped the server do a spot check things wouldn't have ended the way it did.   When finally trying resolve the issue, I got no resolution at all. Believe me when I say this but I tried so hard to sugar coat everything I said to at least be polite about it. But the answer for everything was two gift cards and a sorry and hope they can get it right next time.   Well the problem is that they didn't go above and beyond to fix the issue. Guest satisfaction is clearly not something they take pride in at all. Apology usually goes a long way for me but not in this case. Nothing genuine about the experience, it just felt as if they want me to hurry up and leave which I'm perfectly fine with cause I too wanted leave immediately.   Let me thank the hostess that night for at least trying to resolve the situation.  All in all it was memorable experience, it definitely set a new low for me. Poor food and poor service. Plenty of better restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I don't recommend sitting at the bar stool tables, they're awkward and uncomfortable. Otherwise a nice environment, and decently priced. The Ahi Tuna burger is by far my favourite because of how unique the nearly-cooked fish tastes. It's grilled on the edges and completely raw on the inside, similar to a medium steak. It's a heavier dish for sure; very flavourful and tasty."}
{"text":"Probably the best service I've experienced in a long time. I came here for my friends bday. This is my first time here and wow.. The service was impeccable.   The bday girls pasta didn't have sauce, so the server took it back. She waited for almost 30 mins to get her pasta back. The manager came to apologize and explained why the pasta was so \"dry\" and didn't have sauce. While she was eating, the manager came back again and was quick to apologize about how long she had to wait for it. She offered to completely waive the meal because of the long wait and was very apologetic about it. She was.. Fantastic! She was quite the looker too ;)  Prior to that, service was still fantastic. The food was good, but the price did not really match the food. I understand it's a \"premium casual\" restaurant, but the price definitely does not fit casual. I'd give it 4.5 stars, - 0.5 for price."}
{"text":"Special Occasion?  GO ELSEWHERE...  I had tried to make reservations for 25 people here for a special occasion during lunch hours.  The communication started out well,but ended up in a HUGE disappointment.  We worked out the date, time, and menu over a series of weeks.  In the end, it came down to the seating area.  They wanted to seat the party behind the bar area on elevated bar stools and table.  However, I told them that it would not be ideal because I have young children and elderly guests and hopping off and on high stools is a safety concern.  They pretty much said \"take it or leave it\", and something along the lines of \"we rather not have your business\"...  I asked them why they could not be flexible, since I was told me that lunch time is not busy.   Regardelss of the fact, they insisted there is no other area and all areas MUST be kept for walk-in patrons only.  Interesting....so you are treated worse if you make reservations.... Like it would kill them if they gave us 3 hours in a different area.  They made it mission impossible. On top of this, they tried to rectify the problem by offering to book my party at the Eaton Centre location. If I wanted downtown; I would have connected directly with them don't you think?  That's like offering someone coke when they want wine.  Good going Joey's Markville!   At this point, I have no reason to consider Joey's Markville when there are similar and better options within 15 mins radius.  I ended up booking with MILESTONES Richmond Hill; communication was quick, precise, and accomodating. Thank goodness for Milestones; they saved the day.  Plus, the group menu options and pricing was excellent! See my review for that."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Don't think I'll be returning any time soon. Ordered diet coke, there's so much ice in the drink it fills up 3/4 of the glass. Shared the ahi tuna tacos for a starter, the tacos just tasted of the ginger dressing and nothing else. It overpowered the flavour of the tiny 1\" square of 3mm thick tuna (being generous with dimension here). Server said *bite sized*  she wasn't joking.  Then I had the hand pressed burger, bun less. I was wondering who hand pressed it, it looked like my 7 year old had splatted it on the grill but then my 7 year old could have shaped it into a better burger shape. My friend had chicken fettuccine Alfredo, pretty standard, not much to get wrong. Service is ok, but had several people come and bring us things.  Don't know why there's so much hype for this place. Food is not that great, especially considering the price. Probably just a good sports bar.  Won't be in a hurry to come back here again."}
{"text":"Seriously this place have the worst service. The staff need to go get retrain or get a new job."}
{"text":"Order the surf and turf - spicy tuna maki with a sirloin served on a skillet.  Best spicy tuna maki outside of a real sushi restaurant and the steak is smothered in rich sauce."}
{"text":"I left a review on Google as well - this one on Yelp is just going to be a little bit more in depth.  Let me start off by saying, I had first eaten at this restaurant a few days ago with my mom, and we had such an amazing time. The waitress was lovely and an absolute sweetheart and the food was delicious. It was a gorgeous clear day so we had an amazing seat on the patio. Overall an enjoyable experience and we wanted to celebrate a father's day dinner at this restaurant. We wanted to have dinner earlier because our family is busy and it's hard for everyone to get together, so I called in early to make a reservation for 5 people at 7 PM specifically with booth seating.  Google Review: If you're going to hire hostesses for 'Pretty faces', at least hire one with a functioning brain. We made a reservation for a table of 5 at 7 pm, and get there right before 7, only to watch them give the family before us our table. When the hostess came back, we told her we had a booth reservation, but she just gave away the last booth. She literally said in front of us, 'I messed that up\", and told us a lot of people have been sitting for over 2 hours and haven't left yet, and if we wanted a high table instead. We decided to wait for a booth because that's what we reserved for. After around 20 minutes, we just left because it was just ridiculous and terrible service. At one point the hostess came back and asked, sorry was this for 5 people or 4 people. I'm assuming it was too hard for her to check the reservation. Really, what's the point of making a reservation when it isn't even honored? Just absolutely disgusting service. I want to say the last time we were here we had a blast and our waitress was such a sweetheart, but this hostess couldn't have even bothered.   ---  I have the time stamp on my phone after we left the restaurant and went somewhere else to celebrate, I received a voicemail from Joey's telling us that a booth has just opened up and we can come back for the table. If my reservation was specifically at 7 PM, and you call me at 7:40, why would you think I would even want to come back? I'm just appalled and baffled by the service and the incompetency that was shared between three hostesses that were working tonight."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tasting dishes I've ever had. Great preparation, fresh tasting foods and juices and friendly staff that understand customer service. Comfortable atmosphere for couples, professionals or even a family. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Elegant and classy decor, dim atmosphere and very beautiful waitresses. Had reservations for 9pm, and arrived early, so a couple of us decided to have a few drinks at the bar (which is located in the center of the restaurant) The waitresses/bartenders were drop dead gorgeous, friendly, and made us feel very welcomed. They had a nice light lager on tap from Muskoka brewries: $5.75/pint. My eyes led astray from the tempting waitresses as I watched the San Francesco 49ers vs San Diego Chargers on the many bright flat screen TVs. I really enjoyed the meal I ordered which was the Steak and Sushi (Japanese surf & turf, tataki style, CAB prime steak, ponzu sauce, and rainbow roll.) My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the ponzu sauce was oh so flavorful. I will definitely be paying a visit to this place, next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've never been to Joeys before and I must say I was impressed with the food. I had the Greek chicken pita with yam fries! Excellent pricing! The food quality is A+ I love it! The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. The staff were friendly and quick to service! I'm definitely coming back. The restaurant looks beautiful!"}
{"text":"I took my family for dinner back to my old neighborhood because I went to Markville Mall. I have tried other Joeys  locations and was never impressed to the point I made it a regular outing place for dinner, but not disgusted or severely dissapointed to say I would never return. I will say this location the hostess was very warm & inviting.  We sat down & waited for 15 minutes before our server came to take drink orders;(boo) we all had pop except 1 person ordered a ice tea which was so watered down we asked for it to be replaced 4 times, until the person in my party said ill just have a coke. That was annoying.  Next we ordered apps: sushi cones which were good, except the vessel it was served in reminded me of an ice cream holder. The rice was seasoned well with vinegar, the shrimp was battered & surrounded by cucumbers,avocado& lettuce. We also had Asian lettuce wraps;it's too bad it was more crispy fried noodles than chicken in this app cause I felt ripped off, but it had a good taste.  Dinner I had the Kobe meatballs with tagliatelle pasta in cream sauce which was really tasty;the meatballs were in a chunky tomato sauce which was too sour or \"raw\" in my opinion & I didn't like the two sauces in one plate. I think if the meatball sauce was better then I could appreciate making a rose sauce in my plate. Two people had the burgers, I person liked 1 person was not impressed. My mom had the Greek chicken souvlaki meal & had sweet potato fries with it. Well much to our big surprise the meal came out as a pita wrap! Wtf!? If We were told it would be this way I wouldn't have been do disappointed & feeling ripped off for the price! I can get a pita wrap for $5.00 in the mall. A little bait n hook thing here. We also tried the butter-chicken which was served with rice sprinkled with almonds, naan bread & pappadums. It tasted good, but was sloppy looking, the sauce was dripping over the bowl.  For dessert we tried the homemade donuts or \"bomboloni\" (Sicilian) these were brought to us without any side dishes to eat on. We waited to see our server but she disappeared for another 15minutes. So I just told everyone to eat & put a napkin as there dessert plate. They were amazing! The table across from me ordered them too but their server brought them plates to share.  Overall I always leave Joeys never fully satisfied but not hugely disappointed to say I would never try another one. This location had their food items done pretty good compared to the other ones. I'm giving this a 2/5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with their new patio! So happy they changed their sangrias to larger glasses since they always put so much ice in it so it wasn't much liquid. I always get the ahi tuna burger, steak and sushi, or ahi tina salad. Sushi cones and pesto shrimp flatbread are recommended as appetizers. Sangria and elderflower Collins are my favourite drinks here. Service is good and the ladies are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place, delicious food, and friendly staff. It was our first time here and not our last. Enjoy the see thru theatre kitchen and the flat screen tvs in the men's bathroom. I had the Bombay chicken curry with plain naan and basmati rice and my bf had grilled chicken club on a Portuguese bun yummy!!"}
{"text":"My GFs and I frequent this location often as it always has good vibes and it's a great place for happy hour. Best place to sit is at the bar (if you can find seats) as the servers are more attentive and easier to flag down.   I've been a fan of this chain since the locations opened in Toronto. Worst part is that they change up their menu and some of my favourite items such as the donuts got discontinued :(  I love the protein style burger here. It tastes exactly like a healthy Big Mac! Also a big fan of their ahi tuna salad, fettuccine Alfredo, salmon entree, lettuce wraps with chicken or shrimp and most importantly, their key lime pie... I usually don't eat pie but this one is to die for! The tangy and sweet is just perfect with a pie crust that is just the right amount of crunch. The whipped cream that they top it off with is made in house and it's so fluffy! Must try!"}
{"text":"I come here often as it is near by home and the food it better than your average Kelsey'/moxies restaurant. I really enjoyed the pesto shrimp flat bread and calamari fritti a lot. I would always order the same appetizers, the can never go wrong. The spicy aioli sauce that come with the calamari complements the dish well. I always ask for extra sauce. The flat bread is amazing, so full of flavour and each bite is delish. I have also tried the tandoori flat bread and I found it really spicy and a bit dry. For mains, I usually get the ahi tuna salad. I believe they have changed their menus recently and now have yellow fin tuna? I like the ravioli with lobster cream and grilled prawns. The dish is packed with flavour in every bite, it can get really filling. Remember to make a reservation cause it often gets packed on Friday nights or weekends. As for the staff, I've been a lot of new faces through out the year, not always the best staff, but it's the food that counts right?"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 than a 3. My boyfriend and I have been here once before and it was good enough to get 5 stars. But we're here on a Friday at dinner time. So food could've been a little faster and a LOT hotter. I ordered the steak and sushi... Sushi was absolutely amazing but the steak was quite cold. I regret ordering the steak at all and should have just ordered a bigger order of sushi and skipped the steak. I'm leaving slightly unsatisfied despite knowing its a pretty good place. Drinks are good and service is on par with price."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Joey's I had lunch there and ordered a head of time due to time constraints.  They were pretty good at making sure the order was in on time so we were only slightly delayed.  Service was great since there were only two tables around, but the plating of our items was super slow considering our orders were probably the only ones in.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad and then I understood why the playing took time as it was presented very well.  The mix of flavours made every single bite enjoyable and the ahi tuna was fabulous.  The salad is very refreshing and you don't leave feeling hungry.  The only negative is the price.  Overall, it was a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"this place has great atmosphere and good service ! the only thing is that sometimes it can be a little slow since there are many customers however the waiters are informative and have great customer service. I got the yellowfin tuna salad from my friends recommendation and it was one of the best salads I've ever had. the avocado spicy ranch sauce yummy tuna and crunchy peanuts have an amazing experience  the Vietnamese sandwich was also good with crunchy fries at the side. I came with a a party of 5 and we all were very satisfied  we ordered a apple pie and it was expected to arrive in 10 min but took about 20-30 minutes. however the apple pie was very good and had the perfect amount of sweetness  on other visits I have gotten the mushroom pasta which is what I usually get but can be a little salty and the farmers market chicken salad which is an amazing salad as well !!  Expect to spend around $20-$25 here"}
{"text":"Just went there recently to Joey over the long weekend  What a great experience   We arrived there around 8:30ish  Greeted by an outgoing hostess who immediately had us smiling and laughing  20 minute wait wasn't bad at all given it was a Saturday night and not to mention the Raps game was on  Our hostess then out of the blue handed us and a few others waiting complimentary red wine.....believe it was their house blend  We then got seated..... Waitress greeted us and was again outgoing and made us feel comfortable   We ordered the Tandoori flatbread.....excellent as usual  I ordered the lobster ravioli.....spot on  My wife had the 500 and she enjoyed it as well.....though she was slightly sad that The Beach salad was removed from the menus  Ended the night with an apple pie which was delish  We have never been disappointed by this location  At the end of the night.....tip we gave was well deserved  Only thing I might suggest is possibly throwing in an exotic stir fry noodle dish to the menu.....something with a lil' spice to it   Keep up the good work Joey Markville"}
{"text":"Summary: Upscale chain restaurant has solid service and decent sized portions, and nice decor.  Parking is always a pain in the Markville Mall area, but this is a nicer restaurant than the other chain restaurants nearby, and worth a try.  The steak is fairly good, and it's a fine place to treat yourself (ALTHOUGH Peter's Fine Dining IS down the road...). Some of the 'cultural' picks ('butter chicken' or 'pad thai' for example) aren't the best, but you get a sense of what to get and what's not (the traditional Canadian food is better, in my opinion).  Of course, you're not just paying for the food - but also the decor and service. Decor is pleasant and service is solid. There was an issue with the food and the service staff were prompt and professional in addressing the matter.  Perhaps the most interesting thing about this is the washrooms - they have quite the - shall we say - unique design."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place is great. The waiters/waitress are extremely nice. However, the food is on the higher price considering the food you will receive. The steak and sushi was around 30 after tax and tips and an average girl like me wouldn't even get full on it. You get a few pieces of the steak with sushi on the side. The steak was super salty and no where to my likings. I also got the sweet potato fries priced around $12 after tax and tips which would be considered on a higher price since you do get a really small portion. Overall, I would say that their food are all on the saltier side and I might consider going back just to try other things but for now, searching for a better restaurant seems better priority."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying:  IF YOU ARE LOOKING UP REVIEWS TO SEE IF YOU SHOULD EAT HERE- DONT. Go to SCADDABUSH instead(I do not work here and this is not a promo). Don't waste your time on shitty food and shitty customer service.    Came here on a Sunday night for a party of 3 at 550PM for dinner.   We had a seat immediately after walking in, but our server took 20 minutes to come. Jay ordered two items on their 3.50 snack hour from the bus boy.. Our actual server came 5 minutes after our apps came.. Not even before the apps (sushi roll) were lifted from the plate, it's like the server purposely was standing there waiting for us to take a bite then instantly asked \"how was our food\" while our mouths were full...   I was quite disappointed when I realized lobster grilled cheese was off the menu as those were pretty popular...we ordered our entrees and they came 40 minutes after.... The restaurant wasn't even busy. Lots of empty tables everywhere.  We got our waters and I asked for a straw for my niece; straw was dusty.....  When the food came, I asked for share plates... There was a hair on it. Whatever..  I ordered to share a chicken and rib and my bf ordered the butter chicken.  I didn't take any pictures because of how displeased I was with the service.   Chicken & rib- chicken was salty, and dry. Ribs were good.  Butter chicken- it wasn't up to my West Indian food standards let's just say that... Very \"Americany-tasting\"  We ordered the baked apple pie with salted caramel for dessert to share... What could go wrong with a freshly baked apple pie? Nothing.. This was the highlight of the  entire meal.   I did again asked for share plates. Our server brought plates and placed them down for us... there were stains/dried up food stuck on two plates she then noticed and replaced them.. (In my head I was thinking - when grabbing plates shouldn't you double check them before placing them in front of your customer?? Kind of embarrassing).   At the end when you're done eating, there was a girl who immediately chases you before heading out (seemed desperate) saying DID YOU ENJOY YOUR DINNER? She did not miss a single person leaving.. I get it. You're trying to have customers leaving feeling content; but shouldn't it start from when we first sat down?"}
{"text":"I love joey's!  Such a good treat sometimes!! Joey Markville has great ambience and it looks really classy. The restaurant is clean and has nice spacious booths with fluffy plush backs. Perfect.  The food at joey's is definitely overpriced but it's sooo good! One guilty pleasure- I love their fries. You know why? They're identical to mcdonald's fries and those are indeed my guiltiest pleasure. They're not as salted, which is good. I love their protein style burger! It's my go-to every time I go. I'm not a fan of bread, so they use lettuce wraps instead. I always end up like a mess when I eat it, but it's super delicious and (slightly) healthy.  Their chicken souvlaki is really yummy too, the pita is extra soft and the inside is warm and hearty. Even the food I don't like (aka fish) looks incredible. That ahi tuna salad ... droolworthy.  I enjoy their drinks too, and they have drink specials every day.  I like the summer sangria, there's so much fruit infused into it, it's awesome. The elderflower collins is a pretty drink too, although it's not AS good.   I'd definitely go back, no doubt about it.  If it's your first time, make sure you dress nicely/semi-nicely, or you may be judged or feel a bit insecure because it's such a nice place."}
{"text":"Made a reservation a month ahead of time and confirmed multiple times by email and phone. Specifically asked for a larger table due to having two seniors and an expectant mother, and yet we had to wait for 45 minutes even though they called to confirm earlier that day.  It was my 19th birthday so I ordered my first drink, and of course it came with a little extra protein - a fruit fly. Then on the bill, they charged for my drink TWICE. I barely wanted to pay for it once with the fly and long wait.  I normally love Joey restaurants, very disappointed this time. The food was still okay, small portions for somethings like the ravioli or paella, but that's expected. Just very disappointed in the long wait and general confusion. Hostesses were nice, but not nice enough for the circumstances."}
{"text":"I have been to Joey a few times.  It's my go-to place when we go out to eat on work nights with the kid in tow.  The food is above-average as far as chain food goes.  I do like that they don't have huge portions, as they seem to focus more on quality.  I almost always go for the steak frites (but with yam frites instead of regular fries).  Always tasty and not too heavy.  The sliders, which my son loves, are really good.  Taste like mini big macs!  My husband generally gets the ribs and/or chicken - - the rotisserie chicken is very good.  If you're looking for an appetizer, the Japanese gyoza is delicious.  So, my problem with Joey is the prices.  It is grossly overpriced.  It annoys me.  If it's not a work night, I will generally go south into North York or Toronto for a non-chain with food that is as good (or better) but the prices are way lower.    One thing I do love about Joey Markville is the service.  First, the hostesses/hosts, wait staff and runners are all so nice.  Many of them have been there for a while, which shows that they enjoy the place and are probably treated well.  One funny thing that we always notice is how attractive everyone is.  It's ...remarkable.  My son is always commenting on the pretty girls and trying to talk to them, and they are so nice to him (he's 5, btw).  The other week, my son couldn't stop talking about how he survived his flu shot and the waiter (Costa, who is awesome), brought us some drink samples on a plate and he had written 'NO FLU' and drew a bicep in raspberry coulis.  It was a funny thing, and we appreciated it.  It's just friendly and fun service.    Other than that, I do like the atmosphere.  It's a pretty good place, but the price keeps me from visiting often."}
{"text":"Have nothing bad to say about this place! AHI TUNA CLUB is a must try this restaurant. It this the burger that encompasses a the elements of sweet and salty, crunchy and tender. Also, the fries are the equivalent of premium MCD fries.  The restaurant is always fully booked so make your reservations early or arrive early and prepare for a 20-30 minute wait. If you do walk in, they do provide samples of their appetizer so it helps with the wait."}
{"text":"Compared to all the Joey's around the GTA, this one is by far the worst. Nothing is consistent here. We saw a table beside us order the same dish, and they were both plated completely different. The ambience and layout of this Joey's does not compare to any of the others I've visited in the surrounding areas. For the prices they charge, you might aswell go to Swiss Chalet across the parking lot. Do yourself a favor, and drive to the Shops at Don Mills instead, if you want the full Joey's experience."}
{"text":"Gorgeous and friendly hostesses and servers!  A bit on the loud side in terms of noise but my wife and I had dined during the lunch hour and they were playing one of the Olympics Canadian mens' hockey games on the numerous television screens throughout the restaurant - so it's a given.  The food was so-so but perhaps we chose the wrong items on the menu for our tastes.  We look forward to trying JOEY for a evening dining experience soon.  We'll be back for sure.  Parking is not bad since it's located on the outside of Markville Shopping Centre on the south side facing Highway 7."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Came here for company dinner. It was fantastic. The steak was so good, the environment and service of the restaurant is also very good. Utensils are really clean. It's definitely a 5 star experience and I would recommend for everyone who come across looking for a good and high class restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"I've been to the JOEYs at Eatons, Don Mills, and Markville. If I were to compared them all, I would give them all very similar reviews. I absolutely love their appetizers and so far there isn't one that I didn't like. Their main course menu is very average, the food was made well, but didn't impress me, which you would expect with those prices."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family for my parents anniversary. As with other branches, this restaurant offers cell phone calls to notify when a table is ready. As a definite plus, we were offered each a glass of red wine in the waiting area as a courtesy, perhaps seeing we were waiting for a table for 45 mins.   Ambience: this fusion restaurant and bar has exactly the kind of atmosphere you would expect. The lighting was dim, but not too dark, creating a cozy and romantic feel. The restaurant is split into two sections, with the bar on the west side and its abundance of TV screens. The music is appropriately tuned to an energetic kind of music, which adds to the overall dining experience. 4/5 stars  Service: from the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with energetic young waitresses with smiles on their faces. The server who served us took time to explain each dish that we ordered, even though we knew what we were ordering. Very prompt service and accessible. Extra points for that server who cracked a joke at us at the beginning when prepping for drinks! One of the better served restaurants in my opinion. 4/5 stars  Food: I ordered steak and sushi. While I can only speak for my experience, this might be the weakest link. The medium well steak that was served was noticeably cold. However, the steak itself tasted well, it was basked in garlic and ginger, which was a delight. The sushi was a rainbow roll, while not as fresh and authentic as traditional Japanese restaurants, held up the standards of a quality fusion cuisine. 3/5 stars  Price: appropriately priced, 3 dollar signs  Health: this otherwise meat and carbs heavy meal has the option of choosing soup or Caesar salad as an appetizer. Overall my meal amounted to about 25% vegetables, 40% carbs and 35% protein. As far as eating out goes, this is more in appropriate proportions. 3/5 stars  Overall, this restaurant is strong for its good atmosphere and excellent service. While food might not be its strongest suit, it is still a quality fine dining experience for dates, celebrations or just a good time with family and friends.  Overall rating: 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere !!! Very nice and sophisticated !!! I came here with my friends and it was great. The staffs are pleasant and friendly. The waitress was amazing and took care of all us. I ordered the California chicken sandwich and it was delicious. It's pricey but worth it. Would recommend this place and definitely come back"}
{"text":"I have been to other Joey locations before all over the GTA, and for the most part they are consistent in terms of decor and service.   Joey Markville has improved the image of Markville mall, and its nice to have a decent restaurant to go to.   My experience at this location wasn't the best, perhaps it was the layout of the restaurant, and the service.   For food,  we ended up ordering their Calamari with asparagus served with a chipotle dip.  Freshly made, not rubbery, presentation was well done, asparagus was lightly fried, and no excessive batter was used....overall the dip complimented the plate. 3.5/5  The main! I ended up having their steak and sushi!!!! i know it sounds quite disgusting to mix the two but you'd be surprised, they complimented one another.  Firstly I felt it was a bit of a rip off...$24 for sliced pieces of steak and a small roll of sushi?? hmmm.. nonetheless the steak was full of flavor, not over salted, cooked tender to perfection.  The sushi was fresh, and tasty so overall this dish is about a 4/5  I would definitely come back a second time just to give Joey a second chance.  Joey at Eaton Ctr and Shops on Don Mills proved to prevail a lot better......."}
{"text":"First time at this location of Joey's. I was quite impressed with the service, mainly due to the fact that my friend was quite picky since she has worked in the field of service. Everything worked fine for me, but she didn't have an enjoyable time...  It was a tough one for me I have to say..I ordered my usual Lobster Grilled Cheese which always turns out the way I want it to. It's decent pricing and very filling...  My friend on the other hand, ordered grilled salmon but she didn't want any mushrooms and zucchini....the dish ended up coming out with the salmon and only peppers which freaked her out because she thought there were onions as well...and another thing that made her upset was the fact that the salmon's skin was still on it..  For me, I find it fine to have the skin on...I mean it is grilled salmon...so I can tell she was upset from beginning till the end...the manager came and asked us everything was ok but obviously my friend said no; even though the manager tried to make it up to us by offering us free appetizer and/or salad....she ended up saying no and that was it...  At the end of everything, I just wanted to get out because of my company...sighs...the bill came and the manager ended up giving us the first round of alcohols free...which was a nice gesture even though my company was being mean to them..  All in all, I would come back to Joey's without hesitation..but may need to think of who I'm coming with..=D"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Virginia for a hockey tournament. Joey's reminds us of Houston's in the states. Would've given them a 5 star except when we came in our initial hostess were rude about the wait. Told us that there would be a 45-55 min wait for a party of 3 at 7:30 PM, although there were many open tables. I commented about the open tables and one hostess was a bit snotty telling me that she was filling them up. They were actually letting people go walk around the mall and they'd call them when a table opened up.....and who knows if those people changed their  mind or went somewhere else.   But, Tracy, who was managing the hostesses, did a great job listening to our complaints. She was keeping the waiting patrons engaged by providing free tastes of menu items and drinks. She was proactive to make sure the wait didn't tarnish anyone's experience. She was extremely proactive in changing our initial impression of the hostesses.   And, then we got a very friendly server - Jacklyn. She was helpful with the menu, answering our questions and bringing out our food in a timely manner.   The food was pretty good - we liked the sweet and sour cauliflower. I enjoyed the power salad with greens, quinoa, cauliflower, avocado, etc.   Plus, we enjoyed the ambiance.....we were near the open air patio.   So, although our  experience started out on a bumpy note, Tracy and Jacklyn did a great job of turning it around for us. We left on a happy and satiated."}
{"text":"Markham is known for the Chinese food & little else. So all Joey's has to do is hire 20 beautiful women to serve typical up market chain restaurant type food & presto ...a recipe for success & to become the hottest spot in Markham. Kinda sad if you think about it"}
{"text":"Went to Joey's for a birthday get-together. The place is spacious and well decorated. I ordered their spicy chicken banh mi- and was not really impressed. The french baguette was not toasted- and felt very stale. The spicy chicken, didnt have any exciting flavor. The portion was pretty small for its price point $16.75 + $2 for yam fries. Therefore, beside having a nice interior, theres not much else for it."}
{"text":"The food at Joey is pretty good, as are the drinks. The service is often okay but nothing exceptional. They are nice with reservations as two of the members of our party were running late but they allowed us to stay a while even though the restaurant was quite busy. The menu has changed slightly"}
{"text":"Joeys is great! Their food is always good and inspired. Service and quality vary depending on the location but I would say Markville is pretty good. I've had a bad experience here before, so I think it's a hit and miss with the servers and hostesses. Some are really nice and some wouldn't give you a second thought.   To begin, or server today was Jill. She is amazing! Great smile, no hair hiding her face like some other servers, makes great eye contact, speaks loud enough for us to hear her, and makes great suggestions. She was really kind and checked up on how we were doing just enough not to intrude but enough to know we were looked after. The dinner was relaxing and very enjoyable thanks to her. I don't think servers like her are appreciated enough. :) hopefully the manager sees this.   The decor is okay. It matches the other Joey's but this one seems more.... Industrial. Gears and chains and an \"Indian motorcycles\" light up florescent sign that kind of isn't that attractive. Otherwise, is clean, the booths are comfortable, and even the high tops are comfy.   The food was great. I found my salad to be really bitter so I didn't finish it but the steak was amazing. It was cooked exactly to the temperature I requested and the fries are always nice. My mom has the fish tacos. Those were fantastic! Light, yet filling, and bursting with flavor.   We decided to share a chocolate molten lava souffle with the fresh raspberries and vanilla bean ice cream. It was a little tooooo rich. But the ice cream was delicious! :)   Definitely a good place to go once in a while."}
{"text":"Delish and excellent service as usual! The service at Joeys is the best. They are very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They always ask if you have allergies and if there are any special preferences such as salad dressing on the side, or food sensitivities. It's that extra touch that makes a big difference. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I had the ravioli with lobster cream.  The meal, taste wise was fantastic. The portions, however were very underwhelming.  I had to stop at McDonald's on the way home to completely satisfy my hungry. The restaurant was not well lit, but some may like the atmosphere it creates."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Had the Katsu Chicken Peanut Salad and the Rainbow roll and both were excellent!! Coffee was really good too! Fantastic lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Since my son Alex is taking us out for dinner we decided to come to Joey's. The food is great. We had blacken Basa, roasted chicken, Alfredo fettuccine, mushroom burger, Morocco soap with Caesar salad. The burger look the most delicious somehow. The pasta was a little small.  The service was pretty good also. The place is very nice. It's also a great place to have a drink. Yes we will come again!"}
{"text":"This JOEY's is located in CF Markville (Formerly Markville Shopping Centre). Tons of parking, but most of it is probably taken by mall shoppers, so you might have to walk a bit if you're just coming for the food.  Upon going in, greeted upon arrival, seated quickly. The lights are nice and dim - music, service was quick and attentive. I went on a pretty busy night with two friends but what impressed me was how the server made sure things were okay, especially on a busy night.  The food is alright. Not amazing but it's not bad. For a chain restaurant, it's okay!  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna Club was good. Sweet bun, sweet pepper relish, salty juicy tuna, crispy onion ring ~ the sweet potato fries weren't as good as other locations though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service here was great. There was a wait when we went- although it wasn't long (15 minutes). We were seated near the kitchen where you can watch the food being prepared. I ordered the Paella-- the dish was very flavourful, filling, and tasted authentic. We also ordered the steak-- very tasty and tender. Drink wise, we ordered beers and a sangria. The sangria was really fruity.  A really nice experience."}
{"text":"I go here all the time especially when it comes to special occasions or even just taking out my parents. I went one night and I decided to get a salmon with my salad. I was completely uncooked in the middle, at first my boyfriend said it was okay but as soon as I got to the middle it was more slimy. I literally almost wanted to puke. The manager was great though and I asked him if I could just get it a little more cooked. Though, it took forever to comeback and my server didn't come to check up on us, that's why I had to look for a manager. I'm never one to complain, if they get my order wrong I would still eat it . By the time my food came back everyone was already done eating. However, this place is always a great place to eat but there's just some servers they need to train a little more. I work at a hotel restaurant for years, and the key is to always check after there few bites that there food is good and to make sure there always happy. This guy never showed up until he saw the manager at our table."}
{"text":"I come here every so often to catch up with a friend who lives nearby. It's our go-to spot to get some drinks and a good meal.  I've had the steak frites before, and although the portion size is a little small, it tasted delicious.   More recently, I've had the Tuna Sashimi Salad and this is just devine. Seared, sliced tuna served with an Asian style salad with peanuts and fried noodles on top, with a big hunk of avocado.   The service here is always good, we're always taken care of and are never left searching for someone to help us.   They also have daily specials on beer and alcohol which is a nice thing to have. My friend and I both wanted a little more beer to drink but didn't want to have a pint each since we were both driving so we asked our server for 1 pint and 2 glasses. She came back with 2 glasses already poured (more than halfway! I'd say about 70% full each). That's amazing service.   The downfall to this place is, it's always super busy so make reservations way in advance or expect to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. But I guess that is just a compliment to this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding service is the best part of Joey Markville. The food is excellent, as well, albeit a bit expensive. We tried the lobster grilled cheese (delicious with cocktail sauce), rare tuna salad, Penang shrimp, and the tandoori flatbread (best thing of all).   This place is a great place for a nice lunch or dinner. Amy was our server (high top in the bar) and the service was spot on perfect."}
{"text":"Service here is awesome. Waiters are friendly and polite and the atmosphere and decor is comfortable and classy.   Tried the apple pie and chocolate lava cake. Both came to the table looking perfect. The vanilla ice cream that came with both were delicious as well. The chocolate lava cake was just a bit too sweet for me but the apple pie was a crowd pleaser.  Will be back to try the main menu soon hopefully!"}
{"text":"I've been invited to JOEY Markville several times but was never able to make it there before now. We had a reservation for 7 at 7pm and it was quite busy when we arrived. That gave me a few minutes to look around while waiting for our table. Nice place. I like the layout, ambiance, and being able to see into the open kitchen. It was kinda noisy though.  We started ordering drinks and apps as soon as the last of our party arrived. The menu seems to have a lot of Asian and South Asian influences, flavours that I'm familiar with and like. Good.  We started with calamari, wings, chili chicken, and tandoori chicken flatbread. They were nicely presented and all tasted pretty good. The Hot Wings were perhaps my favourite of the apps.  Our mains consisted of Steak and Sushi combo, Ravioli with Lobster Cream and Grilled Prawns, Spanish Paella, Steak, Yellowfin Tuna, and I had the Chicken and Ribs combo. Again, everything looked good and the comments were very positive.  Although I prefer dark meat, the chicken breast was very moist and tender, with good flavour. The ribs didn't exactly fall off the bone but the flavour was good. I preferred the chicken.  We ordered a couple of desserts to share and ended up ordering a second Raspberry Butterscotch Budino because it was so good. The other dessert was apple pie with vanilla ice cream, also very good.  Overall, the food was enjoyable. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. Our server was inattentive and wasn't even present for most of the evening. One of my dining companions left our table several times to get extra napkins from the nearby server station and to order drinks from the bar. We had to ask for plates, napkins, cutlery, and drinks. I never got the water that I asked for. This place deserves better servers. We diners deserve better service."}
{"text":"The many recommendations for the Ahi Tuna Club does not steer you wrong. The burger was surprisingly good, with each bite tasting slightly different then the last. There was a good contrast between the tartness of the relish versus the salt from the bacon. The bun is on the sweet and soft side (not my first choice) but the tuna brings a good smokiness and the onion rings brings the crunch that balances everything out well. Throw in a pile of matchstick fries and I'm happy with the dish. The only complaint about my burger was that the avocado was on the hard and unripe side. My dinner partner got the Sashimi Tuna Salad and seemed to like every bite.  I would definitely recommend getting a reservation for dinner. I went on a random rainy Thursday night and the place was pretty packed with people. Luckily, I followed my own advice and was seated right away. The only drawback would be the constantly booming pop and rap music the whole night. Good for a night out with friends, not so good if you are trying to have a in-depth conversation about anything. I felt like I was shouting across the table most times and leaning forward hard to hear the replies. But in all, not a bad place for good food and a night out."}
{"text":"One word. Horrible. My friend and I arrived at the restaurant on September 10, 2015 and were seated at a booth by a friendly waitress. We were seated near the bar and asked to be seated near the dining area and the waitress kindly complied and seated us in a different section of the restaurant. We were looking at our menus when the hostess appears and rudely points to a reserved sign and told us the seats were reserved and we could not sit there (mind you, the waitress seated us, not as if we absentmindedly sat on a booth with no direction). Then she rudely asked how long we were going to take to eat our food, and at this point we have not even ordered yet. My friend and I were quite stunned at the complete lack of customer service skills this woman possessed as well us her blatant rudeness. My friend asked the hostess when the reservation was and she stormed off to check looking extremely angry at this point. She comes back and states \"4:30, can you guys leave by then\". My friend and I politely said we would be done because we wanted the woman to just get away from us at this point. So moral of the story. Avoid this place and if you see an Asian hostess with a resting bitch face, head across the street to another restaurant. We immediately left afterward because we did not feel like eating with a time limit. Lastly I would like to state to the hostess with the horredous attitude, perhaps get a different job because you lack any form of customer service skills and simply left a bad taste in my mouth regarding the Joey franchises as a whole!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday.  Great place with nice atmosphere.  I like Joey after I went to their downtown location.  The menu is smaller in this location, and the service is worse as well.  We waited for over 15 minutes for our server.  She came and gave us the cutlery and took our menu.  She had mistaken us from the table next to us; and obviously, she had forgotten about us.  She came back in a minute and took our order.  We ordered calamari fritto and chicken fettuccine alfredo.  The food came in \"warm\"; and seemed like they had been sitting in the kitchen for a bit before arriving on our table.  There were just a few tiny chunks of chicken and they were flavorless.  This is the worst fettuccine alfredo ever."}
{"text":"One of the better JOEY's out there in terms service. Everyone was extremely friendly and servers checked on you periodically without it feeling too much or too little.  I slowly became a regular as every dish I've tried here has usually been a success. The Steak and Sushi was really good, the steak was sliced and perfectly seared to a medium rare, but the sushi was rather bland in comparison.  Their burgers all come in more than adequate portions. My boyfriend has a very large appetite and he found their burgers + fries to be very filling. Definitely would recommend the yam fries for an additional ~$2  The rotisserie chickens are somewhat bland, but the accompaniment of either sauce or gravy usually fixed that issue.   All and all, the service was good and the food was good. Would definitely come back, but it is a tad bit on the pricer side."}
{"text":"4 stars for decor and ambience. Great place to meet up for drinks. Food is always consistent and good. Joey doesn't have the best food, but they are always good.  I would say it's above average. Don't look for creativity or a twist, it's just good comfort food. I like their fish tacos, chicken souvlaki, steak-most the time I don't remember how they taste afterwards but at the time it's good enough for me to finish the plate. It's a nice place to hang out with friends and just chill."}
{"text":"We came here for an office lunch.  JOEY Markville is a well rounded restaurant operation.  From decoration (contemporary yet has a sense of humour as reflected in the historical car decoratives), wait staff appearance (black uniform, pressed and clean), services (polite and effective), food (rich in flavours, slightly adventuous menu, pleasant plating, reasonable portion) and, last but not least, prices (under $20 for most of the lunch menu), everything is well caculated and executed to be on spot with market trends of casual fine dining.  I must admit that I fully enjoyed the overall dining experience while I admired the sophiscated business operation.  That this is a massive business empire is more in the face than escapes me."}
{"text":"Nice place, huge but great ambiance. Service was excellent and had some really good recommendations. Food was tasty and prepared to perfection.  First time Steak & Sushi, second time Spicy BBQ Chicken.  Both times were recommended and I loved them. Awesome name as well :)  I'll be back, soon."}
{"text":"Tried their full rib with some  wine and loved it. Service was excellent, and good cocktail as well. Recommended for family and couples"}
{"text":"Right outside markville mall, was very convenient for me as I was shopping. Decor was really nice and modern. I was able to get a nice quiet seat. Waitress was not very friendly but she was a good waitress.  I got the sushi cone, it had all the sushi favors I like. Deep fried prawn, ginger, wasabi, spicy mayo. After eating one I debated ordering another. I didn't get a picture because I ate it all up! My main was the paella it was very tasty, lots of protein but a little oily. The best paella I have had to date. A little spicy, creamy and not overly tomato-y. Deftinetly would go again and order 6 sushi cones!"}
{"text":"Food at Joey is getting worse..... SERVERS are also the BIGGEST ISSUE at this fancy restaurant treating their customers UNPROFESSIONALLY. It is very funny that they have to call the same person on the waiting list for multiple times to make sure they pick up their phone calls while holding tables for them but not letting people in who are PHYSICALLY waiting at the restaurant for HOURS. ARE YOU SERIOUS????? Their attitude is like: WAIT OR LEAVE, IT'S NOT OUR MATTER. Because people who are on the the waiting list is our FIRST PRIORITY and yes I need to call them for multiple times until they pick up their phone calls. Good Job Joey!!! You have made your customer a wonderful experience. Keep going with your GREAT ATTITUDE towards your customers!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the one at Yorkdale and have had positive experiences at both. Wait times can be horrendous on busy nights though, so be warned. Food is excellent and quite unique, especially when compared to your standard run-of-the-mill mall restaurants. I'd much rather eat here than most other mall restaurants in fact. They also have a fairly good vegetarian menu and are fairly mindful of patrons with gluten sensitivities. Service was courteous and attentive.   FYI, highlight of the evening was probably the ahi tuna tacos, but everything ordered was at the very least up to par."}
{"text":"I have been to a few locations for this franchise and this location is by far my favourite one to dine in. They have an open kitchen concept and you are able to see how clean and organized they are in maintaining this establishment. So far during my visits, I have never experienced any form of bad service as they had been great in all my visits.  The staffs at this location are very friendly and they are quick with accommodating to your needs. The food is also great and I never had any issues with what they put in front of me."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I always expect chain restaurants to suck - but Joey's feels cooler than a chain and like they actually care about the food they serve.  I've been to this location a bunch of times but I started feeling like a regular after the 2nd visit! So far I've had the calamari, fish tacos, paella, fettucine, apple pie and the chocolate lava cake. All of it was delicious. I find the portions to be slightly small (maybe an extra 10-15% more food??) but everything is so good. Especially the paella! Reminds me of what I ate in Spain, and that is tough to replicate!  This place is always busy so def recommend reservations. Sitting at the bar is also good. Nice service and convenient location in the mall."}
{"text":"First impression was good visually. Everything was open concept, even the kitchen. The place was packed during lunch hours on a Friday afternoon and service was top notch. I think the waitresses were trained to give you the sweetest smile. To start things off we were given a glass of water with lipstick stains all over it. Yeah, stains. So it wasn't just one lipstick stain but several. It wasn't red in color but it was fairly noticeable. We didn't bother complaining about it but instead shared one glass of water. I have the picture to prove it but I won't bother posting it.   Considering how busy it was the food arrived pretty quickly, in about 10 minutes. For starters we got the spinach, artichoke dip with tortilla chips $12 (3/5 stars). For the mains we got a tuna club $17.50 (4/5 stars) and a lobster grilled cheese $16.50 (3/5 stars). In terms of taste everything tasted good especially the tuna club. It was suppose to come out rare but it was more like well done to me. Still tasted good though. The fries were really disappointing. For what they call fine dining, I'm pretty sure these fries were the same type you would find on the bottom shelf of a grocery store in the off-brand section. They were the cheapest quality fries imaginable.   The lobster sandwich I'm really gonna have to complain about. First off - where's the lobster? There was so little of it and it was chopped into little pieces mixed into the cheese that you can't even notice the lobster is there at all. Secondly, the sandwich was so small - literally 2 slices of Wonder Bread. Third, it was drenched in so much butter that it was all you could taste. As Homer Simpson would say, Mmmmmmm butter. For the prices we pay I really expected much more.  I guess those sweet smiles from the waitresses weren't free after all :("}
{"text":"The 1 star rating is mainly because of the waitress/hostess we had.  We ordered an Ahi Tuna Burger with side salad; we thought it was weird she hadn't asked us what kind seeing how it's usually house or caesar. She was also being diligent and asked if we had any allergies, like to almonds or any nuts, we said no. Out comes out food with a side of FRIES. When I brought it up to the waitress, she seemed utterly confused. THEN she asks, house or caesar. She then asks AGAIN if we had allergies. It was like she was taking our order for the first time. She looked so clueless, just blank stares.  We waited a good 10 mins for this side salad (that we never got) and all we see is her chatting up other customers who had already paid. It took another 10 mins to flag her down to ask for the bill. Since the meal was done and STILL NO SALAD. She then asks, did you get your salad? No. No we did not. Oh, you're sorry? Oh, wait, you're not.  When she comes back with the bills, she says to us like she was doing us a big favor, \"I didn't charge you for the salad cause it shouldn't have taken that long.\" WHAT?  WHAT?????? 1) It didn't take long cause it NEVER CAME, 2) It comes as a side with the meal. What would you have charged us for?!  What terrible service. The bill thing really ticked us off since it made NO sense.  I've been to the Joeys at Eatons and Shops at Don Mills, and service have always been exceptional."}
{"text":"Great place to hang with friends. Interior is amazing and love the atmosphere. The service is hit or miss but mostly a hit. The food is decent but i dont go here for the food. being located in the mall, there is plentt of parking but can get filled fast depending on time and day. Overall a solid 4 stars in my book"}
{"text":"I came to Joeys three times in the span of two weeks. That should tell you I'm a fan. All three times I had the steak frites. That should also tell you I love their streak frites. I find their meat flavourful and well cooked. Even my mom who is picky loved her steak. She got the mushroom steak two times. Their fries are skinny and just the right amount of crisp. They also serve a eggroll shaped fried mashed potato side that's delicious. Lots of drink options, sides, and other healthier but still delicious mains. The space is big but even then it gets filled quickly during weekends so make sure you make reservations. The vibe and atmosphere make it great for a date, family or friends outing or after work bite with colleagues."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is always super friendly and really go out of their way to ensure you have an amazing dining experience. Been to this location a good few times now and has some food issues - flatbread was a bit burnt on the ends but they made another one, wrong burger sent out but made a new one free of charge. The service makes up for slight wait times and the environment makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"When the Apple Store tells you it's going to be another 90 minutes, it's not terrible to find a Joey's in the mall. I expected normal mall markups on the food, but it seemed like regular Joey's prices.  Furnishings are all very dark, but set against huge windows letting in a lot of light during daytime. Busy place but no one looks like they have been waiting too long.  Our server Corinna was very helpful with my kid's egg allergy. Always appreciated.  We grabbed the sliders (without buns), garlic bread  and I think it was rainbow roll. My expectations of sushi in a non-sushi restaurant tend to be low - I was just appreciative of a decent fish option.  In and out in about 30 minutes. Not rushed. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Joey's location at Markville. The quality of food is similar to those of other Joey restaurants. Overall I find pretty tasty for a chain restaurant.  Atmosphere is great for drinks with friends. Service for me has been fantastic at this location."}
{"text":"Came here multiple times for drinks and food. The service is really great and everyone is super friendly. I love their atmosphere, it's nice and relaxing with the black decor. During the summer, the patio is amazing and you should definitely give it a try if it isn't super hot.   I've tried their lobster grilled sandwich, which was really good. The fries taste like McDonald fries and they aren't as greasy which is bonus! Their shrimp paella is really good too, but beware if you're a spice lover- don't put too much hot sauce like I did. The hot sauce they gave me was tobasco hot sauce and it made the dish too sour for me."}
{"text":"My charming boyfriend and I went to Joey's Markville with my friends for a going-away dinner. The food was alright I guess. I had the Sashimi Tuna Salad ($18.50) and my boyfriend had the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo ($18.50). I forgot what my friends had, frankly I don't care :P We shared a couple of appetizers. We had the Ahi Tuna Tacos, which my friends enjoyed. I just prefer soft tacos so I didn't have any. I really enjoyed the Yam Fries ($9) as did the rest of the table. For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the Baked to Order Apple Pie, which redeemed the night. The only thing I recommend is the Apple Pie ($8.50) with Maple Ice Cream, which was quite tasty."}
{"text":"dope restaurant , good food , great service , nice music , good vibes only . best spot to eat if you are at markville mall. Check out the rotisserie chicken and ribs & give er a try =)"}
{"text":"Horrible service every time. The food isn't bad, but for its price point, I expect better service than the swiss chalet across from it. The Joeys at Don Mills is much more pleasant and welcoming.  Been here 3 times, once was impulsive, so my party was there in tees and jeans. We were greeted by dirty looks and crummy attitude from the moment we got there, as if we were peasants not worthy of eating there. Another time I went with my bf. The waitress got his order wrong, give him steak and sushi instead of steak with mushrooms. Was extremely rude and accused us of saying steak and \"shrooms\" which lead to her mishearing. When our actual food came after another 20mins, instead of letting us eat, she tried to engage in random irrelevant chitchat, in hopes to save her tips. Not once did she apologize. In all honesty, the food is not bad. But it isn't special enough to make up for the horrible service when there are comparable options 5mins drive away."}
{"text":"Was out with relatives who wanted to go out to eat and decided to meet up at Joey's as we were in the Markville Mall area. At the door was told there was a kids menu as we have 3 young ones but once we got the menu there was none so not sure what happend there:) Saturday night dinner crowd was in effect so wait was about 30 mins.  Decor and vibe is of a cool younger set so that music and atmosphere was lively.  Service was quick and courteous and servers came by often.  Food came out quickly despite the restaurant being so busy.  Food however was a hit and miss and not all of us enjoyed the food.    Sweet potato fries with cheese was nice appetizer.  The calamari however was over cooked and oily.   The Bacon Burger was excellent on a sesame bagel bun and the accompanied fries were similar to McDonald's fries with less salt which was really good.  The Fettuccini Alfredo was such a tiny portion!  Not much bigger then a size of a small fist, which was extremely disappointing considering that it was an entr√©e!  For desserts the molten lava cake wasn't very good but the made to order apple pie with maple cream was outstanding!    I think by now you get the point... half the food was good, the other half not so much.  This is often the problem for high end chain restaurants.  Overall the restaurant was OK.  Atmosphere and service was very good but food quality should definitely have been higher and more consistent considering the price point of the restaurant.  It is a fun place to go to if you are just hanging out with friends but not the first place I would go to for food.  For the same price I would prefer to go to the Keg which is where Joey has established itself as an alternative to."}
{"text":"I've always liked the atmosphere at Joey's - service is generally good -Now a chain but the food is decent but WAY over-priced. I took my 12 year old Niece and my 6 year old daughter for lunch - it was $120 and my daughter had portions from our orders. I have had the gyoza - excellent - lettuce wrap - good (not a light dish actually) Super food 500 is a bit boring but good for a lunch  - The  Yellow FinTuna salad (may not sound so intriguing) has beautiful presentation and is excellent. CAB sirloin steak was good too. I've been here on business and pleasure. I chose $$$$ because if you have a glass of wine or 2 with dinner you are definitely paying in the higher bracket for casual dining."}
{"text":"Is a nice place, the server was professional and friendly. However i do not know what kind of restaurant it is, it has everything on the menu, food from all around the world, but why dont i eat a ramen from a ramen store, why dont i eat sushi at sushi place? Why has to be Joey? Its menu doesn't make any sense to me... The food presentation was very nice. The taste was alright, but not the wow kind, at this price range I can have alot of choices. Mostly not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at JOEY Markville.  I ordered what I always order at a JOEY ... Rotisserie Chicken (minus the veggies).  It was delicious!  The portion of chicken was big and it was tender.  The mashed potatoes tasted just right.  And the sauce was tasty!    Nisa was my server and she was great!  She was very friendly and took excellent care of me.  She is obviously very happy to be working there ... in fact, she said, \"I'm proud to work here.\"  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Joey Markville on a Tuesday night for a girls night out and we had an awesome time. We didn't make reservations so we had to wait for a table.  After 20 mins, we were seated. The service was excellent, every hostess or servers we saw/met were extremely friendly. I ordered the Steak and Mushroom Demi as the entree and asked it to be medium rare.  I was very impressed that the steak was actually cooked medium rare, just like I asked.  Usually at lot of times, restaurants tend to over cook steak... but not this Joey :)  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant in other locations and its a great date night. Wonderful atmosphere. I have not had a bad thing on the menu.   The Markville location can get really cold with all the windows slid away. Are there twice when this was the case and it really ruined the experience."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant! Love this place. Only thing I can complain about is there is always a wait no matter what day you go and they don't take many reservations. Most of the time you will be waiting 40 min to an hour for a table. Food is good and service is usually quite good as well."}
{"text":"Before I always come to Joey a few times in a month, cuz I love their lobster sandwich. The crispy bread and the lobster is just perfectly combined with the sauce. Unfortunately, they took that out and changed the menu a few months ago. But recently I randomly went in for dinner since me and my friends couldn't think of what to eat. We ordered the Ravioli With Lobster Cream & Grilled Prawns and Pasta Pomodoro, surprisingly I think both are great. For the Ravioli, the sauce is very creamy, but it won't be too heavy. Probably, for now, that would be my new fav dish, but I hope they can still add the lobster sandwich back, I miss it so much!!"}
{"text":"I had the regular burger and fries for lunch when I was there. I thought it was a bit pricey for what it's worth but I guess you go there for the atmosphere and vibes. It comes off as a more classy place to have lunch or dinner with a group of friends. There's a bar, the lights are dimmed, nice patio, simple and modern decor, and they seem to hire slim pretty waitresses whose dress code is black - its that kind of restaurant.  The atmosphere is really good and what you'd expect from a higher end restaurant, the food quality is decent but it isn't anything memorable. Its a great place to go with friends, a lot of big tables that are meant for groups.   Service is also pretty good. Waitresses are fast on their heels when you ask for something and I found the wait times pretty fast. Overall, I'd give this a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This location is average at best. Having visited the Calgary location several times - this location simply cannot compare.  We didn't have to wait long for a booth, which is great. I was a little put off by the PAPER napkins. Seriously, folks? Paper?!  The food was bland and overpriced. I had the lobster grilled cheese sandwich (with microscopic bits of lobster) and my friend had the steak frites.  Not particularly tasty or special.  Our server was awesome. Chris was warm, accommodating and friendly. He earned his tip that night. Probably won't see him again as I have no desire to return to JOEY Markville."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my GNO at Joey last Thursday :) We came in round 9:30pm, and the restaurant is already packed! Highly advise you to make a reservation... doesn't matter which day you come in! I confirmed with our server that Joey only take reservations for max. 6 people - most tables are booths and small, round high tables. It can get pretty loud in the restaurant... I wouldn't recommend you to go as a large group anyway. Also, they only take a limited amount of reservations, mostly taking walk-ins, so first come, first serve. This coming Saturday (Nov.23) is already fully booked...... D:  Lots of excitement while dining at the lounge area (near bar and kitchen) that evening. The kitchen was like a fully lit playground and it was very entertaining just watching chefs work away :) Love the cozy atmosphere, attentive and friendly service (Thanks Sharon!), tasty food and well presented dishes. The only down part was that the round table was a bit small......... On a positive note, GREAT place to hang out for drinks ;)  The 4 of us shared the following:  1. Prawns Florentine Ravioli - SO GOOD. Creamy goodness. All the ingredients really compliment each other... cherry tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, bacon bits, fresh herbs, and jumbo prawns!! 2. Steak & Rainbow Sushi Roll - Such an interesting combo :D Quality, quality food. When did Joey start doing Asian fusion? They even offer chopsticks at the table #nicetouch 3. Calamari & Yam Fries - Very light and crispy... comes with dipping sauces. Calamari came with deep fried veggies too (a bonus, yeah!), and yam fries were seasoned with sea salt and lightly garnished with fresh cheese *drools* 4. Sashimi Tuna Entree Salad - Beautiful presentation. Delicious tuna, but I didn't really enjoy the salad portion... just meh for me. I'm not a salad person, sorry lol. 5. Dark Chocolate Lava Cake with ice cream - Melts-in-your-mouth good. Enough said :)  Overall, a solid 4-star. I'm so happy and super excited for this new addition to our neighbourhood. YAY :D! New place to hang out after a long day of work... will be coming back very soon. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Been here at times for some drinks and dessert but ate here once for dinner and wont do it again. Dinky tuna, microscopic lobster grilled cheese, chicken with wantons, why waste money and time here. Buying the atmosphere way too much and the servers not too friendly. Wont be back for dinner. Maybe for drinks."}
{"text":"Took my parents there for lunch.  Staff helpful and understanding.  The food was good. Also a good choice on the menu  I like it. You can sit in a booth or at a high table or at the bar.   Good all round"}
{"text":"Really a poor experience last Saturday night. Where do i begin?  - The waitresses mixed up drink and good orders for our party multiple times. The lights were on but no one was home pretty much sums it up.the place was busy but not packed....really disappointing. - Food is way overpriced...not sure why it can't be quality or creativity. - Waited 45 minutes for water....water! - Tv's don't face every direction and everyone was there to see the leafs game.....kelseys..jackastors have it on Lol, not sure what's up with Joeys they tout themselves as a higher end eatery. - We had a large party of about 25...maybe 2 ppl got the right order ever though they took all our names down - Food was flavorless.  Just overall very disappointing, won't be back would rather spend my money where the establishments gives a few f*&ks about the customers."}

{"text":"First time at this location and I must say it is very convenient for those who want to grab a nice dinner after a bit of shopping. The restaurant has its own entrance so it doesn't close until 12 on the weekday unlike other restaurants at markville mall.  Love the atmosphere, very chill and upscale for a bar restaurant. Food was pretty good!  Tried the trio of dips which was delicious! There's more dip that bread so don't be stingy ! Just glob it on for each bite. My friend had the chilli chicken which was not the typical type you'd get from an Asian Hakka style -- more western with some crunchiness and sweetness. A refreshing chicken dish. Also tried the fully loaded crispy mashed potatoes for a side. They look like spring rolls and are simply amazing! Seriously get them if you go to joeys. Seriously.   Total cost around $35-40 not bad for a chain upscale restaurant.   Food does take a bit of time to come out and it will only be longer the more busy it gets -- however we went during a lull and got our food at a reasonable time. Staff was friendly and attentive.   Definite go to spot."}
{"text":"Every time that I've come here, I've had amazing service. The waitresses are all beautiful and they're super friendly. Today, I came in to the restaurant with 7 people and they've seated us at the long table near the bar. I was kind of saddened about the fact that we couldn't sit at the booths since it would be better to talk face to face. However, I was more than satisfied with the service I got from them.  I got the ahi tuna salad which is what I order most of the time that I go. The dressing on this salad is a little more sour than usual, much like the balsamic vinaigrette. The ahi tuna was made perfectly, as per usual- pink on the inside and perfectly seared on the outside.  I'm pretty happy with one of their white wines - McWilliams chardonnay - and that's my usual go-to drink when ever I'm having a chat with friends.  I'd definitely recommend joeys at markville to anyone who wants a good time and good service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  First time here at this location for dinner with family celebrating a birthday.  I've also been to the Eaton Centre location.  Among all the chain restaurants similar to Joey, I have to say this is my favourite.  What's not to like - steak & sushi.  Perfect combo!  I had the herb crust salmon which was delicious.  My husband had the steak & sushi which he really enjoyed.  I personally find the steak in this dish a little to salty because the steak is sliced and then it sits in the ponzu sauce.  I had this dish last time at the Eaton Centre location.  I still feel after trying the steak the 2nd time that it would be tastier to be served with the ponzu sauce on aside.  The service was a little slow as it took awhile before our server came by to take our order.  Maybe it's because our reservations was a bit early at 5pm?  Overall, we had a good time and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant chain offers the same service across multiple locations . I have been to the location at Markvillle mall, Yorkdale and Eaton Center and have a similar great experience.   Decor / Ambience - 5/5 The setup in the restaurant is split in half - dining side for families and the bar side with seating around the bar as well as booths. In the summertime , they also open up the two outside patios with comfortable yet modern seating. The lighting and tiling give it an upper echelon fancier bar / restaurant look.   Service - 5/5 There are always more than enough servers to ensure that all parties big and small are looked after in a friendly and fast manner . The staff know majority of the dishes and provide great recommendations upon asking .   Cleanliness - 4/5 Pretty clean considering how busy the restaurant is - you can look inside the kitchen and the bathrooms are also well maintained .   Food - 4/5 The food quality is good no matter what you order . The place offers bar finger foods to mains like steak ,salmon and chicken . The only issue I would raise is the time spent preparing the food as well as the lack of choices in the menu .   Price point - 3/5 This is a fancy upscale place and so drinks and food tend to be on the pricier side . Average is around $30/person for both .   All in - love this place and go to it often as it is close to home and it is always a great time"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Joey's, take my suggestion and visit the one at Eatons instead.   The branch at Markville gives a bad impression of the Joey franchises, and the headquarters should consider looking into the reason why. Although the food and ambience was not bad - I went for desserts one night for the apple pie and the decor was pretty nice, especially the bar - the service almost turned me into Hulk.  Not only did the food take literally forever to arrive, the service was painstakingly slow and the waitresses is in dire need of retraining on etiquette and eye sight. Needless to say NO tips were given at the end of the meal and they should think about why.  Won't be surprised if this place closes down, but really surprised if it continues to stick around any longer."}
{"text":"This is the best Joey's that I have been to. Not a fan of Eaton's or Yorkdale because the food doesn't taste as amazing here. I love the vibe here, even though finding a parking spot in front is a huge pain, this location is simply worth it.   Drinks: Red Sangria - always delicious and great with your food.   Apps: Definitely try the shrimp flatbread. Even though it is a little bit pricier for an app, it is so worth it and good to share. I always end up craving their flat bread after I head home. It's about 15.00 for the shrimp flat bread. DO GET IT!  Dishes: I always get the lobster ravoli but last week, my ravioli was a bit under cooked. Kinda of disappointed but the flatbread totally made up for it. It's always good when I do get it but I think next time I should try something else like the herb salmon with the mash potatoe spring rolls!   Sides: I always LOVE to get the mash potatoe spring roll on the side. It's like two for under 6.00 and so worth it because it's FRIED MASH POTATOES and sprinkled with bacon  Desserts: If you are not full yet, do get the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. The apple pie was warm and delicious and the ice cream combination just kicks it right out the park."}
{"text":"The pasta was over priced and had too little serving. The service was nice and the atmosphere. The fries were amazinggg. Waiters were mamis"}
{"text":"came here to watch the nba finals game 6. 2 other places we tried to go to were packed.  i ordered the baja fish tacos. they don't come with a side. they were pretty good but im not a fan of the tortilla. something needs to be done about it. i can't pinpoint exactly what it is but it's weird. it's like a paper towel almost lol.  when we finished our entrees, the server brought us the check, but didn't ask whether or not we wanted dessert. the gal i was with was a bit annoyed by that understandably, but ordered the apple pie anyway, topped with vanilla ice cream (she ordered a chicken fettuccine i believe). we shared the pie and it was quite delicious. better than my entree i'd say.  overall bill was around $60. wasn't too bad. but could b better."}
{"text":"Should try their lobster grilled cheese and lobster and prawn ravioli. Nice gathering place for families and friends."}
{"text":"This place is basically my go-to restaurant in Markham. You can never ever go wrong with the Ahi Tuna Burger. I get it every single time. It's reliable and delicious! The cranberry sauce with the tuna and onion ring is such a great combo. The only downfall is the extra charge for a salad or sweet potato fries, which is quite excessive at $2.   I've been here probably more than 5 times over the past 2 years and there's nothing that refrains me from coming back. The service is not bad - the waiters check on you every so often. And if you need something, they're always around. It does get busy even though the place is huge so I suggest to always make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Joey Markville is a welcome addition to the Neighbourhood!   I was here for a drink and they do have Daily Specials which is a $1 or $2 off the regular price. Draft Beers starts at $5.75 which is not bad as it is quite a nice environment to hang out with friends to catch a game or just chill. Muskoka Cream Ale, Mad Tom IPA and Mill Street Tankhouse also on draft.  We shared:  Baked TO Order Apple Pie ($8.50) -hand-folded pastry, toasted almonds, caramel, maple ice cream, smelled so good. Flaky pastry which I love and the sourness of the apple matched well with the sweetness of caramel and ice cream.  We drank:  Cocktail Pale Ale ($5) Gringo Cerveza ($5) Gringo Iceberg ($6)  Service was excellent, since it was a weeknight. Our waitress kept checking on us the whole time and make sure everything was fine. This location works much better than the Eatons Centre and Don Mills because distance from the kitchen to the smaller dining area. It is much faster and easily for the waitress to get everywhere in their short tight back skirts and heels.  I will definitely be back again for a night cap or a drink any time.  FYI: The washrooms are so much closer than the Eatons Centre's location, I don't need to \"walk a mile\" to get there.... Beer Drinking=washroom break, which is really important to beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Joeys at markville. I have had a lot of ahi tuna salads from different places and I must say that Joeys does it the best.  The salad is so refreshing. I do not usually order entree salads because I am scared I wont be full, but I must say the salad is a decent size and I did not leave hungry. The food is more pricey than it needs to be. The salad has seared rare tuna, peanuts, mango, avocado, crispy noodles and cilantro ginger dressing. For $19.50 you get a decent amount of ahi tuna. It is not the biggest salad but it surely delicious. If you feel like spending some extra money and treating yourself this salad is the perfect way to go, especially if you want to chat over summer cocktails on the deck."}
{"text":"After last night I won't be returning. I've been a pretty regular customer up until now.  Joey Markville is not a good option for group functions. The staff was not accommodating. We waited 3 hours literally. I understand that there will be a wait for a large group without reservations, but the amount of attitude we received before being seated is inexcusable. We saw plenty of groups being seated before us. 2 hours in I asked the hostess to split our group into 2 smaller groups so we could be seated sooner, the hostess responded \"your table is billed\". I asked what she meant, and she responded \"your table is billed\". Then I said, I don't understand what you mean, and she said \"the table.. you're going to sit at... is billed\". All the while the hostess beside her was laughing at our conversation. I didn't find it funny. I don't understand why no one wanted to help. Over an hour later we were finally seated.  By the time we got our seats I was already in a bad mood. I asked for a medium rare steak but received raw. I hadn't eaten the whole day after working a 10 hour shift- the last thing i wanted to do was send my food back... I was starving. My friends convinced me to send it back because it wasn't edible.. after getting it back my appetite was gone. The staff kinda embarrassed me by making a scene. They asked if my steak was ok, I said yeah, then they wouldn't take yeah as an answer because I wasn't eating anymore.. I practically had to shoo them away. The food was fine, my appetite wasn't.  A couple of my friends also were upset with the (lack of) service. Everyone's food came out except for two people's. Their server forgot what they ordered so they had to order again.  Anyway I'm not coming back. I was really excited because Joey is one of my favourite chains but i'm guessing I was only into this place when they had the temporary staff from Alberta. Those girls knew what they were doing and it showed."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  The wait staff spend most of their time chit-chatting, we had to wave people down from start to finish (every time we visited).  Not worth the price. Unfortunately sometimes that's all that is open past 10pm in Markham which is the ONLY reason we have ever gone more than once."}
{"text":"I'm a Joey's fan, and this is probably one of my favourite locations now. I was impressed at both the service and the food. Upon arrival, we were seated pretty quickly, and our waitress was really kind. She checked up on us often, and made sure that we got everything that we wanted. She also gave good suggestions.   I had the California chicken burger with sweet potato fries and it was so good! When I mean so good, I was even craving that meal the day after!! The food was well done and given to us in a timely manner.   I'll definitely be coming back! Something to keep in mind would be that Joey's is more of a casual spot for lunch, whereas for dinner, it's a bit more classy and a perfect spot to meet up with friends, for a birthday, a special occasion, etc."}
{"text":"It was the start of the summer, the patio is always great for the eyes. The full crowd was a great atmosphere. I had the salmon rice bowl with brown rice. It tasted really good but I find with a lot of high end restaurants they taste really good but it's really salty. I also had a coffee with a pint. The service was really good."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of weekends ago with a friend to order some late night snacks and drinks. We arrived around 11pm and to our surprise the bar was packed. We happened to get seated right away but didn't enjoy the 20 min wait for service. Countless waitresses just kept walking past our table without coming to see if we have been helped. It was only when my friend went back up to the hostess to complain did they realize. At that time the hostess was nice enough to walk over to our table and take our order. When the server finally came to introduce herself she repeated the order back to us only to get it all wrong. I was happy to see when it did arrive it was correct.   Throughout our time there many different servers came to bring us our order. I found this kinda odd because at that point we didn't know who was our actual server. No connection there..   Would I go back.. Probably, but I don't think the service was that great and since they just opened they should be on top of their game."}
{"text":"Joey's is a nice place to have a drink and grab a quick bite. The deco is nice and trendy and staff is always courteous and helpful. One point to note is that the servers always take the time to check that the kids don't have any allergies and make sure the kitchen staff are aware (which is great).  I've been multiple times and my favourite on the menu is definitely the fish tacos.  Also a pretty good place to grab a beer by the bar!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely LOVE Joey's. I've been here many times since it opened and I've never had a bad experience. It can get a little busy but that can be avoided with a reservation. If you decided to go to Joey's on a whim, they will take down your info and give you a call when your table is ready so you can go do some shopping first!  My go to's are the Pesto Shrimp Flatbread, the Ahi Tuna Tacos, the Rainbow Roll, the Crispy Mash.. okay, basically everything on the menu is delicious and I have not tried a dish that I didn't like. In my opinion, their sushi is better than sushi restaurants! I don't know what type of sushi rice they're using, but it's so soft and delicious. Speaking of soft and delicious, the Crispy Mash is a must have! The soft, mashed potatoes are perfectly complimented with the crispy spring roll-like exterior. I've also gotten the Pesto Shrimp Flatbread and Crispy Mash as take out before. It still tastes great after a half hour drive home. I think you're safe ordering anything from Joey's. It's not a hit and miss restaurant; everything tastes great. Unfortunately I'm always too full for dessert, but I will make it my mission to try their desserts one day!  The staff is also very knowledgeable. I came to Joey's once while I was on a cleanse and there were many things that I could not have. Our waitress was able to tell me all the ingredients going into my food and how it's made from start to finish. I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere here. Service is quick and prompt always! The menu has a very vast variety of flavours, all equally delicious.   Young, preppy crowd, great for a few drinks or dinner on a summer night. Patio is very open and the whole atmosphere in this place is very chill and relaxing."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because overall it's a very good experience! It is very consistent between locations and between every visit. You know you're going to get exactly what you expect.  The overall atmosphere is quite nice, and I like the big open kitchen; it's interesting to see them prepare and expedite the food.  I think the restaurant loses a star for its flight steep prices. It's defiantly not cheap, even the drinks!  They do have happy hour which is nice, when during dinner time it can get a little pricy."}
{"text":"Still a four star but I think the place has gone a little too far onto the wild side of things.  I like sitting in the bar area.  It's more lively and less formal when meeting socially.  However, it is still way louder than need be.  We had to ask that the music be turned down a bit so we don't have to yell at eachother from a foot way.  We were informed that the volume was at the lowest.  Really?  The \"BOSS\" was belting out a familiar tune and I really could not even hear my drinking mate.  The volume thing was annoying, however, more annoying was a guy, on his phone sitting at the bar.  Every few seconds he was kicking the vanity plate and banging his hands on the bar top.  This sent vibrations all the way around the bar.  People were getting annoyed, however, Mr. Oblivious didn't care.  So we moved to a high table.  At the high table, we were sitting next to a birthday party group that booked one end of the lounge.  As the group finally got together, one guy decided he needed to make a toast - by the way, this guy must have bathed in the cheap cologne department...ugh!  Anyway, de did one of the stupid whistling that not only got his group's attention but the whole bar.  He was also Mr. Oblivious, as he didn't seem any much embarrassed by his drunken action.  So why still a four and not drop them?  They still have a decent beer and wine list.  Their food for the most part is quite good for a restaurant of this type.  The managers are also quick to address issues - case in point, the music volume somehow found a lower setting.  The obnoxious people somehow settled down.  A whole-hearted apology from the team and a little something was given (we never asked for it).  The evening left us a little hard of hearing but good company, good drinks, decent food and great customer service can make the experience a good one.  Cheers!"}
