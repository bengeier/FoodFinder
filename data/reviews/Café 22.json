{"text":"We just ate here, nice inside, decent service, terrible food!  I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich which barely had any chicken on it and it was slimy. When the waitress came over, I told her the sandwich was not very good.  PLUS, there was a dark hair on my plate which was not mine!!  You'd think for good customer service they would remove the sandwich from my bill......NO!  Waitress took off our appetizer breadstick instead, brutal!  I would never go back here based on this experience.  If you want people to eat in your restaurant, you should stand by the quality of your food!"}
{"text":"After finally getting the attention of the staff, we ordered our pizza and were told it would only take 15 min to pick up. They have a preset menu of pizzas as well as a make your own. I was impressed at the choices of toppings, and type of crusts (gluten free, thin or chicago). My 6 topping XL pizza cost just under $20 with tax, a great deal! As told, our pizza was ready to go in 15 min. I was a little dissapointed because the crust that I ordered was Chicago, but ended up being only slightly thicker than normal crust. The pizza was also undercooked but another 10 min in my oven and it was perfect. They were generous with their toppings, and they seemed pretty fresh as well."}
{"text":"We stopped by there because of a coupon and boy, are we glad we went.  A very nice gentleman (owner) took our order, but also helped us make a decision on what to get.  The atmosphere is relaxed.  The CFL game was on.  The pizza we got (NY pizza) had WHOLE olives, generous toppings, and a crust so crispy it was to die for.  No excessive cheese or tomato sauce (as a NYC pizza fan, I approve) and the price was more than reasonable.  The gentleman was friendly and attentive.  great find and a must visit again!"}
{"text":"Pizza is cheap, toppings are fresh. Flavor is better then little Cesar's lol. better for take out as the place is small but can dine-in, in a pinch"}
{"text":"Great food, service and price.   It's cozy and has a nice layout.  Certainly one of my choice joints."}
{"text":"Love love it here the pizza is amazing and the girls that work here are super nice ! Pizza hotline is my favourite pizza in Calgary good deals !"}
{"text":"Casual and eclectic, Caf√© 22 is a surprisingly good pizza. When you first walk in the massive tree in the centre of the restaurant grabs your attention but only until you see the menu and the huge selection of pizza toppings available. A waitress there once told me that the only rule they have when ordering a pizza is you can't say 'with everything' but, or so she said, if you want to take the ten minutes it takes it list all of the possible toppings then you still end up with a ridiculously full pizza.  They do deliver but it's worth going in if only for the giant tree and not the good service, good ambiance and actually decent drink selection."}
{"text":"We ordered for pickup and the drink was forgotten. We called to let them know and they brought us the drink and gave us coupons for free pizza. Thanks to the Darren and the staff."}
{"text":"We found this little gem thru Yelp. It is a little hole in the wall in a strip mall. My family had both Caesar and Garden salads. The dressings were very tasty. The fettucini Alfredo was very good, as was the spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. We also had a triple pepperoni pizza, which was fabulous. The garlic bread was forgettable, but otherwise, dinner was perfect. The pasta proportions were not huge, so be prepared to feel just satisfied. Not a bad thing in this day and age."}
{"text":"Yummy food, we ordered pizza calazonne and chicken futtuchini.  The service was great.  Nice cozy place."}
{"text":"Not actually open the hours posted.. Attempted to try this place only to find it closed."}
{"text":"i've been to Cafe 22 several times. the lasagna is quite good, but the calzones are spectacular... i actually haven't had anything else on the menu as I always end up with a calzone haha!"}
{"text":"Walk in and get a beer while you wait for one of their delicious pies, in a great lounger chair at that."}
{"text":"Great deals, but mediocre food. The teenage girls that work here are unprofessional and down right rude most of the time. Cute space to dine in but very small."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times over the past year it's been opened. I've also come by myself for work lunch when I can spare the hour.  The interior is a bit weird I find. Large couch chairs, plants and weird light doodads, I think it can go with a bit more simpler set up and still achieve a cafe-bar feel.  Aside from that the service is great. I've had their pizza and pasta and haven't been disappointed yet. The toppings are pretty generic for pizza but they do allow you to mix your toppings. The prices are quite affordable, it's nice to get away with a sit-down meal under $10.  4/30"}
{"text":"I tried the bacon double cheese pizza with fresh tomato, it did mention onions, but man! Covered in them, no other flavored came through   Had the regular crust, (other options were whole wheat and thin) or traditional crust. Semi cooked and gooey in the middle.   Wine list is Citra red or white, period  I was not impressed"}
{"text":"My 3 words for Cafe 22: Charming, casual and surprisingly cafeish. A friend of mine called it \"the best kept secret in Calgary\". It is nestled in the huge Heritage strip mall beside a Subway, and the entrance IS colorful and fun. I never would have happened upon this place \"accidentally\" so I was happy to be let in on the fun.  The place is essentially a licensed cafe with low tables and a ton of low, comfortable chairs. They have bottles of local beer for 3.50, which is definitely a steal. And the food menu is pretty extensive. The pizza was great, but avoid the yam fries. Total dud. The music is low and completely unobtrusive, and I kept double-taking \"this is a bar?!\".   Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for adventure, but for a quiet, extra low key time it is perfect and comfortable. I also enjoyed that it was not a dive, and while all the patrons were youngish, I saw a full representation of Calgary's subcultures. The sociology of a place is important too, y'know?!"}
{"text":"Unlike the other yelpers I found this place to be a bit tacky, the tree is an interesting idea but it is plastic and so are the leaves, so I was imagining all the dust... it just feels so weird, I didn't like the sponged green walls and the out of date lounge chairs.  What I did like was the food and the prices however; I had a great hearty lasagne with tons of herbs, just the right size with tasty garlic toast at under 9 and I took home some fat and scrumptious chicken wings at under 8.  The menu has pizzas, salads, sandwiches, nachos, assorted wings, some good desert items, they could be charging more for these entrees considering some of them come with your choice of soup and salad but most of it is under 8 dollars.  The waitress is over exuberant; I know she means well, better tons of energy than disenchanted I always say."}
{"text":"So...little place with a nice vibe except for one thing. The smell! Intermittent mysterious and terrible fart smell kept drifting our way...there was only one other couple in there and I just don't want to think it was them. Could it have been the smell of rot from the Subway next door? Possibly. The bruschetta was very bad and drizzled with this overly sweet gooey balsamic sauce meant to mimic a genuine reduction. Eww. Also, the tomato was not even diced. It was laziness I'd say. The winner here (besides the cheap drinks) was the calzone. Delicious...would have been perfect if they had gotten the ingredients we ordered correct. They jammed it with pineapple instead of italian sausage, a pretty bad mistake. I might go back...we'll see."}
{"text":"The pizza here is calgary's best kept secret. Good service, good prices. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"A couple of folks from my frisbee team suggested we head to Cafe 22 after our playoff game.  The draw:  cheap drinks and delicious pizza.  For a dozen or so hungry players, that was music to our ears.    Cafe 22 was not what I expected.  I figured we would be in for an Original Joe's meets Moxie's kind of a deal.  Pulling up outside, this place looked more like a coffee shop than a place to meet for drinks (how fitting given the name).  We missed happy hour by about 30 minutes (it ends at 8), however, even at regular price, I don't think I'll ever find a place that could beat the $3.75 I paid for my Sleeman's, save buying it myself.  Inside, I felt more like I was in A Midsummer Night's Dream than a cafe/pub.  There were fake trees strung across the roof and down the walls, and low lighting.  It also wasn't all that busy.  The only reason I can fathom for this is it's location.  It's tucked away in a corner behind the Coop on Macleod Trail.  Beyond the great beer prices (bottled), what sets this place apart is the 10 inch 6 topping pizza I had for $10.  They've got about 20 different toppings you can choose from and the pizza is made to order, mine had beef, bacon, mushrooms, green peppers, garlic and tomato.  Cheese was just a given and not even included in the 6.  So, next down your down south and looking for some good grub and some great prices, give Cafe 22 a shot.  They've also got TVs which were all tuned to sports."}
{"text":"This place is rather unique! I actually like hanging out here on occasion, it's better than a bar that's for bloody sure! Just a nice spot to hang out at and chat with friends and get some very reasonably priced beer and very decent pizza.  The decor is a little strange but I actually like it. Trees, chairs, tables and lights!! Interesting..... .quite different, but quite cozy at the same time.  I see this place as a very nice alternative to a run of the mill pub or sleezy bar, it's small and quite and I like it!! Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Cafe 22 and decided to try their pizza.  We loved all the delicious topping options, and the crust is one of the best stuffed crusts I've ever had.  It was soft, and the cheese was delicious.   They have very cheap beer, and its overall got a great vibe.  My biggest complaint is that you cannot get the same pizza as delivery.   We called Cafe 22 and it is actually through Pizza Hotline.   So we somehow received a totally different pizza than what we had in their restaurant.   We tried asking about the special crust and toppings, and they had no idea what we were talking about.   Super disappointing we couldn't get the same pizza as delivery."}
