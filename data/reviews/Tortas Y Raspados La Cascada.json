{"text":"Always courteous and clean! great tostinachos and raspados with ice cream"}
{"text":"Thank u for having such awesome customer service!!!! It's refreshing to go spend your money and get treated well!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now.  Always nice and clean with friendly staff. The tortas cubana was yummy and of generous portion. My kids love the raspados which are great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We had the tuna sandwich which was pretty good and big. Tried the melon drink it was very refreshing! Highly recommend it. Especially summer is coming. And I ordered the fruit combo with everything on it. (Papaya, kiwi, apples, melon, raisins, coconut, banana, grapes and yogurt on top) u can always request if you don't want some of them. Will try the tostitos next. Nice place to have it around west side of the valley"}
{"text":"They take so long to make your order. I ordered 4 Hamon tortasand literally it took them 30 minutes and i wasn't really surprised with the torta like umm hello I could've made this at home in 5 minutes get your act together guys"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Yelp says it is closed but I just ate a torta and it was open! A must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to love their diablitos all time favorite!! The service is great not see it as a business i see it like me going to a friend's store if that makes senses lol"}
{"text":"I just stopped by to get a raspado. The one they made for me was awful. I got a whole bunch of ice, very little of the syrup, and a couple small spoonfuls of fruit. I asked for ice cream as well and got a measly scoop. The fruit was ok, the syrup tasted bad. Not to mention I had found a couple bugs in my drink after trying to figure out what it was I had in my cup. I didn't even finish my drink. Over $12 spent on two raspados for nothing. I won't be coming back. The quality is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Very great service. Had the tostitos preparados which were very good. Would definitely come back. They also have the best agua de melón"}
{"text":"CLAMATO PREPARADO!! A taste of one of these bad boys will have you speechless. Seriously, I think all I did was make a noise!!! So refreshing yet different than your ordinary refreshing drinks. I want to know how the hell was this drink even conspired. Did someone just throw a couple of things together that they had laying around the kitchen and come up with this extravagant yet simple masterpiece? If you don't know what a Clamato preparado is, let me tell you my version, it's Clamato juice with all the fixings: a celery stick, peppered beef jerky, some kind of sticky sweet spicy candy straw, one tasty shrimp, rimmed with sweet yet spicy seasoning, and topped off with a salted prune. This drink reminds me of a Bloody Mary...without the alcohol. In fact if you wanna get one of these, take it home and provide ur own vodka, this would equal to be a pretty fine happy hour. If you like bloody Mary's, I recommend you trying one of these fine beverages.   Aside from the orgasm I had in my mouth, the place is clean, the people are friendly and the service was fast. I look forward to coming back and getting another one of these! Oh and I enjoyed the fruit cup too!"}
{"text":"This place was very good, it was busy the whole time we were there. The Sonoran style hotdogs were delicious and we also had the pork and chicken Tortas which also were very good. The tuna surprising was very tasty, everything we tried was actually really good.  The had Mexican coke products and they accept all major credit cards. It's a pretty good size place and we were able to get table for all 8 of us.  Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Small place with the look and feel of a Thriftys Ice Cream shop.  They do fruit cups, ice drinks, sonoran hot dogs, tostito bags with ceviche or other toppings, and tortas.  We tried a little bit of everything.  The sonoran hot dogs were pretty good.  The toppings were fresh as was the bun.  It would have been better if the bacon was wrapped around the entire dog or if the dog was higher quality.  The tostito perparado was different.  Can't say I was a big fan.  The tostiviche was really good.  Very fresh and generous amount of toppings.  We passed on the tortas as they looked just like regular sandwiches and not the tortas I am used to.  Although I don't think I'd return or recommend this place to others everything was A-OK and it was fun to try something different."}
{"text":"The service here is good and the food is pretty good... I got the pico de Gallo which is a fruit cup with tajin and it was very fresh and all the fruit was good... I also had a Tortas and it was good too the sauce they serve with it is very tasty... my husband had the ceviche and liked it too and he usually dislikes new places. A little expensive to be honest but good."}
{"text":"I come here once every 2 weeks when we are craving something sweet. Cute family owned spot my kids adore this place and well as my husband. I always order Agua de melón and they get ice cream. Oh don't forget to try the elote loco!! Nacho Cheesy, elotè, with hot Cheetos on top! Delish and my new favorite!"}
{"text":"The stuff here are very friendly and welcoming my odreer tasted amazing ! Very clean smelled really good when I walked in ..I highly recommend this restaurant , service was very fast !! The girl that gave me my order was so nice didn't get her name but was a young Mexican girl may god bless her"}
{"text":"The options are great but way too overpriced. Raspados have a weird flavor to them. And they all share a certain flavor and I dont know if its because they use tap water to make their ice or tap water to make their flavors. Or maybe both. It could be what they sanitize their vats and utensils in that can be giving off that certain odd flavor. The Sonoran Dogs are delicious. Again overpriced. That is the reason for my star rating."}
{"text":"Very clean place. Excellent for a nice Hispanic brunch.  Agua de melón (melon water) is super refreshing and hits the spot on a hot day. Friendly family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"You know when you find that hole-in-the-wall, and you want to share it with EVERYBODY!? Well, here it is! I can only attest for a couple of things so far though... Their Sonoran Dogs (with steamed buns) are quite possibly the best hot dogs in the West Valley. Their Cubana Torta is also... soooooo good! They toast the fresh bread on this, and give you a sauce on the side.  I want to try some more of their stuff, especially since others leaving reviews seem to agree on the quality of this place. Their raspados (not sure of the translation) look great, the clamato sounds good... Now I just have to get back in there!  With the few things that I have had, the service can take longer than the average place. I honestly think that is due to the fact that this is run by a family, they make everything fresh, and they want to keep waste to a minimum. I personally respect and admire that. Don't let that deter you from this wonderful family run business! We need more places like THIS!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name throw you off! Yummy! This place has one of the best tasting ceviche I've ever had. I ordered the Tosticeviche. It was really good. They also offer protein drinks and juices for post pre workouts and conveniently located next to Planet Fitness!  Check it out! It won't disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of antojitos and food. The staff is also quite friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"This place is good, but there is a similar one on Dysart and Van Buren with cheaper prices.  Either way, good place to swim by for a raspo"}
{"text":"I got a banana split with chocolate ice cream. It was the best banana split I have ever had!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The customer service is amazing and their Tortas are the best in the area!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed our visit yesterday for some ice cream and raspados(fresa con nieve).  Employees were helpful and the place was clean.  We will definitely be back to try some other food from their menu."}
{"text":"Great place to have a very good torta. La cubana was quite good, even if the ham was the thin-sliced variety found at the supermarket. The pork, however, tastes like cochinita pibil and it's delicious. The next time I'm having the pork torta.  The horchata and tamarind waters were good but too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious. I usually get the Pork Torta (Pierna) and an horchata. They serve a special sauce alongside the tortas that is so good; it complements the meal perfectly. Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"In town for business & found this place on Yelp. It was close to my hotel & on the way to the office so I decided to check it out. The place is bright & clean. My order was taken right away. It took a few minutes to get my food, but it was freshly made & delicious! I ordered the torta Cubana & agua de melon. I was also happy they took my Amex card.  I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"The Mexican treats and food are authentic and the music reflects their pride in the culture. The service is slow but that's because it's all fresh and made right in front of you. The signage is simple and clear. The place is clean and super friendly. Haven't had anything I didn't like, exploring the menu is rewarding to your taste buds."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I used to live in the neighborhood right behind the plaza and rode my bike here when the weather was nicer and to get fresh air. Originally came to grab an ice cream cone but got a melon (cantaloupe) agua fresca instead since it caught my eye. Soooo refreshing! My bf always gets a clamato preparados which I always hog from him -it is the best one I have ever tasted.  For food I've tried the tuna sandwich and fries. The fries are crispy and fresh and the tuna sandwich has a very unique homemade flavor that I enjoyed. I personally would not order the sandwich again though. I came another time and got the shrimp ceviche which was delish!!!   I also love the staff! I would come here more often but I moved back to the east side and also the prices have increased gradually which makes me sad but I understand it's a business that needs to function. Go here for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Love!  Friendly staff.  Must try the Sonoran style hot dog.  Variety of items on their menu"}
{"text":"1 star, no one in line when we got here .  15 minutes later i asked how much longer?   I was told it had not been started.  2 sandwiches is all we ordered.  unfortunately we will return.   The place is now busy but nobody is eating everybody's waiting."}
{"text":"First time here. Haven't tasted the food yet, but the place is packed and everything is super fresh. I am writing the review in advance because I know it's going to be banging."}
{"text":"SO fresh! The strawberry respados are crazy good! The food is flavorful & freshly made. And the staff is very kind & friendly. Definitely one of my new go-to spots!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. Generous portion sizes and the food is at a very reasonable price point.  I had the mango loco and my wife the Pico de Gallo"}
{"text":"This place is good and has good variety of food. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the prices are way too high. Whoever is in charge of setting them needs to understand that I go once or twice a month, but that would definitely change if prices were lower."}
{"text":"Still coming here. Live the service and management. Food is always consistency with great selection of ice cream. Today me and my wife ordered the regular strawberry and pistachio cones. Definetly worth it every time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite while in the area. I was immediately greeted by a very friendly cashier who took my order and made me feel at home with some small chit chat. The food was delicious, I has the ham sandwich; this masterpiece came loaded with many of my favorite ingredients: ham, cheddar, american, lettuce tomato, avocado, and just the right amount of pickled jalapeños. On the side I was served a ketchup bottle filled with a house chipotle dressing which took each bite to another level.   My melon agua fresca was made to order and was not loaded with sugar like others i've had. Food was great and their friendliness was just an added bonus! I am anxious to return and try some more!"}
{"text":"Ok so all I had was thrifty ice cream and its bomb as always... Staff was really nice, clean."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs. Tortas are ok...tostitos preperados are amazing....churro loco....I like it all! Service is very slow."}
{"text":"Saw the eclectic menu (protein shakes, nachos, ceviche & sandwiches? Who'd a thunk it?) and great reviews and decided to drop in for take out. So glad I did and I can see where I will be craving this in the very near future! So clean, staff beyond nice, food and drink spot on! I believe the owner took our order and asked how we found them, what drew us in and gave us a free small raspados while we waited as first timers. Awesome! Had the Sonoran hot dog (my first & won't be last) and chicken torta - savory and filling! Aguas frescas too - delish! Only drawback is I live 26 miles away, but damn if I won't find a reason to come down this way and make it a must stop!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for a hot summer snack. I craved it almost everyday I was pregnant. Now that's saying something. The staff is always always friendly and always gets my order right (something I have a big pet peev about) a must place to go and be happy about spending your hard earned money"}
{"text":"Seriously glad I found this place! Great raspados, food, drinks, and everything! My family & I enjoy coming here! Such nice employees and awesome customer service! This place totally hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, family ran it looks like and they are very nice. Reminds me of a homey small town environment."}
{"text":"Very good place.  Cuban sorta was quite good.  Strawberry rasped was good also."}
{"text":"Here for the 3rd time. It is really good. I had the ham torta and it was gooood! The tostitos preparados are really good too! I've gone around the valley trying them and these are the closest to the legit Mexican ones. I would keep coming back to this place. However, the only downfall to this is that they take a long time to make something. The place isn't packed and it's only a couple items and it feel they take forever."}
