{"text":"EXCELLENT!!   The smoked salmon app was some of the best I have ever had! Very moist and cooked perfectly but with the right amount of smokey flavor.   I have the filet and crab cake special with red mashed potatoes.   The filet was cooked perfect at med rare but the outside was seared to perfection.   The crab cake was also done perfectly with huge lumps of crab meat and little filler. Lastly, the mashed potatoes were thick and very flavorful.   You know your dinner was great when the mashed potatoes are the worst thing on the plate !"}
{"text":"My favorite ahi salad lives here. Tuna is perfectly cooked. Salad greens are super fresh and the mango on the salad adds the perfect amount of sweetness!"}
{"text":"The management of this restaurant should be ashamed. I had previously attended this restaurant with some other adults while visiting family in the area and enjoyed the food.  Last night I called ahead asking if there would be availability for a party of 6 and was told there was \"NO WAIT\" and to \"come on in\".  We immediately went there(5 minutes later) and  as soon as the hostess saw we had children we were told there would be a 45 minute wait, with empty tables everywhere. The same thing happened to my sister multiple times in the last few years.  I live in CT and have NEVER been discouraged from bringing my well behaved children ANYWHERE, including the TOP restaurants in Manhattan any night of the week, much less a SUNDAY as it was last night.  Shame on 131 for not welcoming everyone. They will never get my business and be warned if you have children--DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Charlotte, I have been on the look-out for good restaurants. Learning about 131 Main in my spin class, my husband and I decided to give it a try. Kudos first: friendly waitstaff, and my martini was way above average. After that, it all was substandard. I ordered the pork chop which the waiter recommended. It was a surprise, but not a good surprise. It was as the chef didn't know what to do with it. It was a gorgeous chop--2 inch thick, but no seasoning, or really, any flavor to it. They asked how I wanted it done (med well)  and proceed to cook it medium rare anyway (which is how they do it if you don't have a preference.) Besides being a thick piece of pork, there wasn't anything else redeeming about it.  The wines by the glass were underwhelming. The first glass of pinot noir they served tasted as if it had been corked overnight--flat. The second one was not notable. There are so many good pinots out there--why serve the mediocre? The gals in my spin class raved about Tuesday night 1/2 priced wine and appetizers.  Perhaps that is 131 Main's forte and we just missed out, as I thought the meal was not worth returning for and a tad overpriced (and we are used to paying more for nice meals where we came from.)"}
{"text":"This is a special place for me. It was where my honey took me on our first date. We started the evening at YN next door (highly recommend but that's another review). Anyway, this week was our anniversary so being the nostalgic guy that he is he took me back there.   I was a little disappointed that he had made reservations online and put in special requests like no table by the bathrooms or too close to the kitchen. Wouldn't you know it... she tried seating us at the very table we specifically asked not to. I mean it was a Wednesday night... not a Friday? So they should really pay more attention to their Open Table Reservations. However, we spoke up and they then gave us a great table.   But, back to business... I ordered the rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes. It was stellar! So good.... I mean it. Mmmm MMM. I had a really big doggie bag though. They give you huge pieces of chicken. We finished our carb comma with the chocolate brownie topped with a heaping scoop of vanilla icecream.... it's fudgy heaven.   I personally like the decor. I think it's hip and cozy. It makes for a romantic dinning experience. Take your chick... she'll love it."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but the service is phenomenal. We went here for lunch and got the Thai Steak Salad and Crab Cake Sandwich. All of the waitresses/waiters were extremely nice and all helped out each other on each of their tables. We must have had at least 3 or 4 different waitresses/waiters stop by to refill our drinks, bring us additional sauces and dressing, and take our empty plates away. What was the result? ...Extremely fast service! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"131 Main is a very trendy restaurant with modern decor and laid back astrosphere. However, the food does not match up. I really wanted to like this place, but there were too many mistakes with my meal.  For appetizers, the devil's eggs were very good. The cornbread was too dry and burnt on the top.   Although there were some misses with the cornbread, I did enjoy the house salad very much. It was refreshing, had great texture, and the greens were very fresh.  For dinner, i ordered the Maryland crab cakes. The crab cakes were very fresh and was made of real lump crab meat. However, it was very salty and the pool of horseradish tasting sauce cheapened and ruined the taste and quality of the crabcakes. For the side order, i substituted the fries for the wild rice salad. PLEASE do not get the wild rice!! It is wayyyy undercooked even though it had great potential especially with the cuurants, cherries, and curry flavor in it. 3 people at my table ordered it and we all didn't eat it! The rice was too hard to chew down.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake and that was truly amazing. I liked the sweetness of the strawberries paired with the breadier shortcake.  Overall, i give 131 main 2 stars for its service and dessert. I guess I was there at an off night, but I will get something else next time and give it another try."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Cornbread is amazing. I ate the lamb shank and wife had he pork chop. I recommend both meals. Great food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Inexperienced hostesses. Not a great way to start off !   Food was very good! Artichokes are always amazing  Stephanie (waitress) very good  Wine very good"}
{"text":"Service at the bar leaves a lot to be desired. Sat unattended for no less than 10 mins just waiting and hoping for the opportunity to order another drink, but by the 11th hour, I bailed. Good food and pleasant atmosphere, but the lack of care and attention rivals that of diners slinging $3 pancakes....not \"high end\" establishments such as this one"}
{"text":"I've found this place to be better for lunch than for dinner.  The roast beef sandwich is unbelievable - rare to medium rare with great au jus.  The desserts are to die for.  I'd take a business lunch here without hesitation.  It's a bit dark if there will be note-taking involved however.  It's also one of the few restaurants I've been to that has an \"Arnold Palmer\" (half and half iced tea and lemonade) on the beverage menu."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review.  I am a HUGE fan of 131 Main.  My \"home\" location is Blakeney and I've never had a bad meal or poor service there.  I wanted to impress two work colleagues after a long, hard day.  But the Dilworth location definitely did not impress and in fact, damaged my credibility.    Yes, it was a Saturday night and no, I didn't have a reservation.  But I did have a cell phone and I called when I was about 10 minutes away.  I was told that the wait was about 20 minutes.  We arrived, got a cocktail and expected - based on what I'd been told on the phone - to have a table before the drink was finished.  It took three drinks, an hour and a half and three visits to the hostess stand before we were seated!  Once seated, one colleague ordered the corn bread appetizer from the first server of the service \"team\".  Might want ot re-think the team concept folks because the entrees arrived long before the cornbread did (to their credit, management did comp the cornbread).  The shrimp and grits entree was judged \"too salty\" and the normally ultra-reliable roast beef sandwich was extremely stingy on the beef.  The only entree consumed in its entirety was the prime rib.  Even the brownie with ice cream was a disappointment and went almost entirely untouched.  I expect honesty from the hostess/host desk.  If the wait is 90 minutes, tell me it's ninety minutes.  Don't mislead me in to thinking that the wait is shorter than it is - the strategy will backfire on you.  And if you do keep me waiting for 90 minutes, you damn well better blow my socks off with the quality of the food.  I may give my Blakeney location another try - but I won't bring a work colleague with a company credit card here again!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant.  The roast beef sandwich was good.  The other people at my table had the Thai salad and they really enjoyed that.  It was huge.  Another person in the group had the Mahi and liked it.  The staff was attentive and nice.  I recommend that you check it out.  It was not cheap though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in south Charlotte. The service is always solid, & I've never felt passed over or neglected while dining here. The quality of the food is very consistent, & any modifications or changes to a menu item are always happily entertained. Most times, a manager is circulating & stops at each table to ask how everything is & if there is anything they can do to make our meal even better. I always appreciate that personal touch. The only negative thing I'd say is to agree with some other reviewers that the cedar plank salmon tends to be undercooked. Since it is my favorite item on the menu, I simply now ask for it to be cooked \"medium well\" & that takes care of the (usually) raw center. Other than that, 131 Main is dining perfection!"}
{"text":"1) Best cornbread ever. Best. BEST.  2) Fantastic service. 3) By LA standards, super cheap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite charlotte restaurants. Food is always good, service is always decent.  Just wish they would add more options/change the menu every once in a while!"}
{"text":"This is one of my \"go-to\" restaurants when I want to be assured a good meal. I have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. Service is consistently good - the wait staff don't interrupt  conversations just to ask if everything is OK.  If you haven't tried 131 Main, you should! PS. Save room for the banana pie. Death by dessert."}
{"text":"Great place.  Trendy decor...lots of room.  Their claim to fame is the fact that they do not have a freezer, so everything has to be fresh.  Great steaks...excellent brunch.  Wish they had a bit more diverse menu although their daily specials are always pretty good.  Located in the back of Blakeney ."}
{"text":"My wife & I love this place because of the excellent food, service & atmosphere. The jalapeño cornbread app is one of the best things on the menu and we don't even like cornbread. The baby back ribs, shrimp & grits and cedar plank salmon are also fantastic."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the location in Cornelius and this is our first time at this location. Still too notch. The ribs are some of the best ribs I've had and the strawberry short cake is amazing! Not very crowded. Complementary valet parking. Service is fantastic. Nick even offered to take the valet ticket for me when it began pouring rain."}
{"text":"131 main is usually one of my favorite places. Christmas Eve service was slow and poor at best . Food was average.  Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"The Prime rib was really good, served with mashed photatos and a unique gravy sauce was soo good. There was dim lighting and gas lamps on the walls. After the sun went down it was really nice inside. I would recomend this place for taking a girl out for a fancy nice dinner. I wish my girlfriend was here on spring break with me so i could have dinner with her!"}
{"text":"Great salads. Great apps. Our waiter talked like mushmouth, but we must have communicated somehow, because the service was otherwise great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will no longer be patronizing 131 Main. My favorite dish is the double dip. But the service has been horrible the last 2 times I've been there. I was celebrating my birthday when upon leaving a server follows us out and accuses members of my party of not paying. After showing our paid receipts she thing goes on to say \"oh I just wanted to make sure no one was charged twice.\" The service during our dinner was horrible, food not brought out at the same time. I ordered the cornbread with my crabcake salad and had to cancel the bread order because it was never brought out. Other members of my party had to wait over 30 minutes to receive food. And being accused of not paying topped off a night of horrible service! The okay food does not make up for the despicable service here."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. We were so excited for our first time going to 131 main and could not be more excited to leave. There was open seating at the bar, we helped ourselves, and sat at a dirty place setting, no acknowledgement and no order, for 5 minutes. They were slightly busy, we understand that, however saying a quick hello, be with you soon would've helped. I will not suggest this place to anyone due to the very poor customer service. We are now at another restaurant, happier and delighted to take our money here."}
{"text":"Limited menu selection at lunch...but still very expensive (we spent $150 for 2 adults , 3 kids- no alcohol, no apps , no dessert).  Customer Service was atrocious.  When we spoke to the manager it became clear that bad customer service trickled down from the top.  And don't get me started about their parking situation...."}
{"text":"We've been to 131 Main three times now so this review is going to combine all of our visits into a giant meatball of information.   First of all, we always park in a spot that says \"Starbucks customers only\" that's across the street. Suck it Starbucks. However, if you don't want to stick it to the man, street parking and valet is available.  Also, we've always sat outside on the patio (but the inside is nice). Also, never had any of their appetizers... just went straight for the meat.   The entrees we've had are:  - Cajun Chicken Pasta - super delish - Roasted Chicken with Smashed Reds - also super delish, loved the smashed reds - the special of the night, which was Prime Rib and I got it with the smashed reds since I loved them so much the first time. The prime rib was cooked to my perfection and it went very well with my glass of Malbec.  The desserts we've had:  - Brownie a la Mode - warm brownie, with nuts, then more nuts on top and warm (vanilla?) ice cream. One of us really liked it, the other was not so crazy about it. - Banana Cream Pie - this thing is huge. It takes the entire plate. At first sight you think you're never gonna finish it but between the two of us we managed to conquer it. I guess we liked it!  Half-price wine on Tuesdays and Sundays. 'Nough said.   We give this place 4.5 mains out of 5."}
{"text":"I don't think that we had the healthiest meal in the world at 131 Main, but for the most part, it was absolutely wonderful. While visiting Charlotte, we wanted to check out Dilworth from our uptown hotel. The trip was easy and we were greeted by a friendly waitress. The Double Dip app felt like pure indulgence. The guac was totally fresh and I am a sucker for pimento cheese. We got the single portion even though the waitress hinted that we should go for the bigger size. Glad we stuck to single as we couldn't even finish it (well we could have...but not with main courses on the way). I had trouble deciding on a main course and went with the crab cakes. This was the one place where 131 Main let me down. I thought they were a bit dry and too fried on the top. The hubby's main dish (it was a special...don't remember what it was) was very good though. For dessert it was the brownie a la mode which while not the fanciest dessert around, sure hit the spot. Overall, we'd definitely go back to 131 Main."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. A little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights due to the bar layout. I would recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"I had a miserable Valentine's Day dinner here. Slow service, and undercooked prime rib is not acceptable when paying these kind of prices. They do have fantastic brownies, which is the only reason I gave them two stars."}
{"text":"Tried this location for restaurant week...will start with the good. The special menu selections were great, had a choice for just about anyone. I had a tough time b/w the ribeye and the  shrimp & grits. I went with the caesar salad, ribeye with red mashed potatoes and key lime pie (my fave). Everything was tasty, had to take the key lime pie to go, was stuffed.    Now the frustrating part  I made a reservation at 6:15, due to it being restaurant week, surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be (maybe b/c it was a Thursday) I had to ask 3 times to be sat...again I had a reservation....just for 2. The hostesses...there were 3, didn't seem tohave it together. I was a little annoyed b/c they didn't seem to know I what to do, and it's fairly simple. Once we were sat we were confused as to who was our server, we had 3 different ones come to our table, one brought water, one brought my friends wine, another mine....maybe they were just helping each other out or b/c we sat close to the bar...don't know not that big of a deal. Finally the first server came back to take our order, she acted like she didn't want to be there, she wasn't rude, but not friendly either (which changed for the better throughout the meal). We did feel rushed though, again the food was tasty, but we literally had 2 bites of our salad and soup and our meal was out, (ribeye-MR, and trout)  I understand these don't take long to cook but wasn't as hot as it should've been by the time we finished with the soup/salad. We weren't even done eating out meals and was asked if we were ready for dessert. Places like this we like to relax a little and enjoy the meal, it's not fast food...and the fact they weren't busy, didn't make sense. I could see if there was a line out the door and they needed the table. Two things I hate when dinning out...eating when I'm cold and being rushed.   Maybe they were just having an off night, will probably come back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I took my son and his girlfriend to 131 Main- Blakney off of Rea Road in Charlotte, NC... for his birthday celebration.   I have enjoyed meals there many times, but less and less over the last 2 years- because the service has gone down and the quality of the food--- while prices have skyrocketed.  An example is our dinner last night.  My son and I had ordered the prime rib sandwich with au jus and horse radish sauce.  This sandwich used to be a 10+ for flavor and value 2 years or so ago.  Now- I could have gotten a much better SANDWICH AT SUBWAY at a 4th of the price !!!!   What used to be sliced/shaved prime rib, the meat? was chopped up in to little pieces and balls and would fall out of the sandwich when I attempted to dip the sandwich in either of the sauces ???  Totally contrary to what the sandwich implies with dipping sauces available.  The taste was so-so at best.  FLIES - flying around the table the entire meal???-  The table had 4-7 flies that kept flying around our heads, our food and the walls or glass dividers at our booth.  I saw several other tables fighting flies as well throughout meals.  When I mentioned this to the waiter _as we are watching flies around his head- , he said this is a problem they are aware of and had sprayed the restaurant the day before to eliminate the problem... obviously, this is not working...  SERVICE ??? After an appetizer, the waiter took away the dishes and the used silverware to \"refresh\" with clean silverware for the yet to be delivered entree' for our table.  Ten (10) minutes or so our entree' was delivered to the table without silverware.  After waiting 5 or so more minutes, I stopped another waiter to help get our silverware so we could enjoy our meal--  this other waiter was kind and responsive.    Encouraging all to always provide your perspective/feedback to restaurants that need to hear from you in an open and honest way !"}
{"text":"The Mr. loves 131 Main.  So does the Mrs. We bring out-of-town guests (from NJ, NY, Ohio, Florida) here for dinner.  They also love 131 Main. Love the cast-iron cornbread, drizzled with honey.  Yummy.  Love the rib-eye and the filet mignon.  With a small salad and some mashed potatoes, you don't need much more than that! The service is attentive and friendly.  The ambience is very nice. It is comfortably located at Blakeney on the Ardrey Kell Road side, though parking can be difficult.  (The Mrs. does not feel that the parking situation detracts from the rating, even though it might mean a longer walk.) This place is ALWAYS packed, so we learned to make reservations, ALWAYS. We highly recommend 131 Main at Blakeney (because we DO eat at this location and ENJOY it, a lot!). We have not eaten at their other locations, so can not say what those are like. The Mr. and Mrs. recommend 131 Main, Blakeney (as do their out-of-town guests). ."}
{"text":"131 has been one of my favorite restaurant in Charlotte for years. When my mother-in-law came to visit I was excited to bring her here. My husband and I came for the meat loaf and the roasted chicken which we got every time we came. So tonight when we came we found out both were taken off the menu. We were so disappointed and when it was brought up to the manager his comment was \"well it's been off the menu for 6 months\". I don't think we will ever go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  I asked for dressing on the side.  They put dressing on the salad and gave me extra dressing on the side.  I guess they don't know that \"on the side\" means DON'T PUT IT ON THE SALAD IDIOTS!   It was so drowned in dressing it was disgusting! Seriously, someone doesn't know what a salad is! Only ate the tuna and started picking on husband's mashed potatoes. NEVER going back there again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and overall pleasant staff.  I sat at the bar and the bartenders were efficient, just not engaging or conversational.  I had the chips and dip which was fresh and satisfying.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered a side Quinoia Salad and a side of grilled shrimp.  The salad was prepared witha lemon dressing and roasted vegetables.  This was great for a side item.  The shrimp were prepared simply but cooked correctly.  Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"First time I've been here and service completely sucked , my servers name was Nate he needs retraining . He never introduced himself as the waiter and just brought water to our table and asked is there any thing else you want to drink , then disappeared for 20 mins . Then came back and asked \"you ready \" ?  I was seriously puzzled I've never seen a waiter like this at 131. With it being restaurant week maybe he just didn't care.  I started to request for management but my date did not want me to make a scene .  The food was amazing as always but this waiters service hit a sour note.  In addition I'm handicapped  and only have one hand , and while I witnessed others dinners being boxed up Nate simply placed the boxes on the razor and kept walking .   This really ruined a place I loved to dine at . I ordered the ribeye and red cabbage it was cooked perfectly .  Food 5 stars this waiter one star hence the 3 star review"}
{"text":"After expressing my service concerns the management made honest efforts to apologize and remedy the situation. Since they made sincere efforts I would give them the benefit of the doubt and try this restaurant again. Hopefully it was just a bad night?"}
{"text":"A friend and I took advantage of the happy hour special...and I have one thing to say: get the cornbread!! Ohmygoodness, the cornbread was sweet with bits of corn and had a little spice (jalapenos??) too.   We also had the Double Dip which was delish. It was half price bottle night (wine) but I did not indulge but what a great deal!   Our server, a young, bubbly (by not overly!) dark haired curly girl was nice. She had good wine recommendations, simply adores the Double Dip and was attentive. Sorry I don't remember her name but I did not see any other servers that fit the description I gave so you should be able to find her. In addition, the hostess (young African American girl) was supernice...and it was nice to see some diversity in the service staff.   When you go, get the cornbread...dare I say it's worth the calories? Yup, it is!"}
{"text":"Nicer sit-down restaurant with good air conditioning for those hot humid days in  Charlotte. We ordered the devil eggs appetizer and 3 fish tacos for lunch. The eggs had a light creamy taste. The tacos were made with Corvina fish, a meaty soft fish that was smoked grilled and went well with the avocado and salsa filling. Overall the food was good and justified its higher prices.  Service was also good. Best way to try an expensive restaurant is to eat at lunch."}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner last night before going to the theater, so we went early. Restaurant seems to be very dark and intimate; however, the lighting at the table was adequate and pleasant.  Wait staff was very helpful with our choices for dinner since we are all seniors and like to share a salad and an entre.  Portions were perfect and everyone enjoyed their meal.  We shared the porkchops, salmon, and crab cakes and all were prepared with excellent sauces.  Would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"My experience actually spurred me to finally register for Yelp after years of surfing it for reviews here in CLT and everywhere we have gone in our travels.  Full disclosure...we did not make it past water.  My mother's birthday is this weekend.  My folks like to have a late lunch when having a big meal (its restaurant week)...around 2PM.  My mom also loves her some Prime Rib; its her staple.  Not many upscale places serve it for lunch.  Browsed the restaurant week listings and there we go - 131 Main has Prime Rib on the docket.  We live north on Rea by 485, so this is close and we have always wanted to give the place a try ever since we moved here just under two years ago.  Called over a week in advance.  Spoke to a nice young lady who placed me on hold and confirmed we would be good at 2 for restaurant week menu and noted it in our reservation.  Cool!  Called today at 11:50 to confirm reservation and restaurant week menu.  Yepper, we have you down and restaurant week menu will be available if requested for lunch and see you have it noted so you should be good sir.  Anyone have a guess where this is heading?  Buehler?  We get there on time for our reservation and were told sorry sir we are not prepared yet for restaurant week.  I request a manager to discuss.  Tell him what is happening and what I did to make sure this very thing did not happen to us on my mother's birthday.  He asks if there anything else on the menu he can provide us...I know the guy was trying but you are an upscale place.  Recognize that you screwed this event up for us and pull me aside.  Tell me this kind of thing does not happen and ask to give them another chance to make it right. Tell me to ask for him when we come back and he will make sure we have a great experience.  I know we will come back to 131 Main eventually to give it another shot; too many good reviews and its so close to Piper.  But I have to express my absolute disappointment in this situation and the way we were handled."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me by taking me to 131 Main last night for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Neither of us had been here before so we were excited to try it out. I ordered the Roasted Chicken with Mashed potatoes and he did the Ribs. OH MY GOSH ... our taste buds were in for it. Everything tasted SO GOOD .. even the coleslaw was amazing and I never eat that. The ambiance was awesome, the music was nice and it felt so warm and cozy in there. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because somehow, someone dropped the ball and didn't acknowledge it was our anniversary. My husband put it on the reservation and no one from the host to the server to management said anything. I was pretty upset but didn't make a big deal and moved on with my night. Overall, it was a great place and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to trying this one out but were disappointed overall.  The appetizers were actually very good.  Crab cakes were very tasty.  Our meal was not at all what we expected.  Our waitress was very helpful and we always had full glasses.  This place is very overpriced for the quality of food you receive."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Went for lunch and I got a chicken dish that was on special for that day it was great. My girlfriend got the \"Awesome Roast Beef\" sandwich. We split our meals and both were great. However, I came here specifically to write a review for the skillet cornbread on the appetizer menu. GET IT! It was incredibly good. Definitely not what I am used to as a southerner from the surrounding area.  It was a cake/cornbread hybrid it seemed. Really sweet and it was served with honey... super good!"}
{"text":"I had the fried flounder the other night and it was really good.  Nice texture on the fish, and the breading seems related to the cornbread that pops up in many places on the menu.  Although they serve it with a nice, home-made tartar sauce, it covered up the tasty fish and seemed unnecessary.  My wife loves the Roast Beef Sandwich here.  I had the \"Main\" salad and felt there was way too much red cabbage in it, but that is a personal thing and it is large enough that eating just what I wanted was plenty.  On previous trips I have tried the deviled egg appetizer and wasn't a fan, even though I really wanted to be.  I never have room for dessert, and I am sure that I am missing out.  Nice atmosphere and waitstaff.  On my first trip here the waitress performed my favorite restaurant trick.  She asked for our drink orders and then proceeded to tell us about the specials and answer questions.  While doing this, the drinks were magically delivered by another waiter to us.  How the heck did they do this?  Not that magical really, but a nice touch--she wrote them down, held the card behind her back as she explained things.  The next waiter by grabbed the card and filled the order.  They do this so seemlessly that it seems like magic.  I hope that I didn't ruin it for anyone.  :)  My least favorite restaurant trick?  Where the waiter \"remembers\" the orders.  Hey Kreskin, I am here for dinner, not a kid's birthday party.  If it works I am not impressed, and if it doesn't I am pissed.  At 131 Main they write it down."}
{"text":"Went for lunch to the Dilworth location.....overpriced (I believe it was $12-$14 for a basic burger and fries!); out of touch waiter; slow service in general - one would think at 11:15am before the lunch crowd rolls in service would be faster, but not true; food quality was average at best.  Maybe it was just our menu selections.  Parking would have been difficult had we not arrived so early.  Too many other great lunch options in Dilworth to eat here again for lunch."}
{"text":"We had heard great things about this spot in Dilworth and decided to try it out! Great dirty martinis and great atmosphere! The $59 dinner special is great! An app, 2 salads, 2 entres, a dessert, and a bottle of wine! What a deal! Service was great!"}
{"text":"I had been resisting going to 131 Main. I was sure it would be bad, but I was wrong...  Step one was take out. The veggie burger was outstanding. For you Houston's fans - VERY similar. The kale side salad, awesome.   Step two - going to dinner with friends. The restaurant was empty so we got out pick of sitting outside on a nice day. The patio eventually filled up. Nothing novel or fancy but really good American bistro food. Great service too which I find is hard to come by in Charlotte."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  I had the shrimp & grits.. Highly recommend! The deviled eggs and guacamole for appetizers, very good.. My lemon drop was obviously made with fresh lemons.. Everything was top notch"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! We've loved everything we've tried there - shrimp & grits, trout, crab cakes, specials, etc. The cornbread app is a must with every meal. Service is always amazing too. This is a regular spot for date nights & business dinners."}

{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Every meal I have eaten there was excellent. I am not a vegetarian but the veggie burger is honestly on of the best burgers in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a party of 7 for a graduation dinner 2 months in advance. They only had 4pm or 9pm. I chose the 4pm. We get to the restaurant and they cram us in this small table in the front of the restaurant instead of the large table we reserved. Very disappointed in the treatment of a restaurant we frequent. Will not be returning to celebrate any events in the future."}
{"text":"Not many places have artichoke hearts on their menu 131 Main are the best!! I have to say in the world because I've never had them anywhere else. Except at home. Sorry Mom. .................................."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I and our mother celebrated my birthday and Valentine's day. We've come here several times, our last visit was Easter.  But today's meal and service was exceptional.  My Mom and I had the sumptuous crab cakes and pan-fried cornbread (a must-have).  My husband had the shrimp and grits.  The crab cakes are all crab no bread filler and the shrimp and grits delicious with slight kick to them.  This is my go to spot for any occasion and we love to bring friends here from out of town too.   Please keep up the truly remarkable service.  I can't wait to visit again and soon as my sister will be visiting from frigid New York in March."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner for ten people. It was hard to fit us all at one table because they are bolted to the floor making it impossible to pull up another table. Nevertheless the food was delicious and the service was good. We had several people waiting on us and the food came out at a decent time making it a great experience!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Need to try many other food here, perhaps try baby ribs and banana cream pie next time!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS consistently good.  The food is excellent, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect regardless of the occasion.   I've brought business associates here for quite meals and celebrations.   I routinely use this restaurant for birthday celebrations -- and you can't beat it for a weekend dinner with friends or just the first lady.   The vodka tonics are among the best you'll ever find -- tonic is ALWAYS fresh which is not the case in most restaurants.  Favorites for us include:  Crab cake meal or crab cake salad, the Awesome Roast Beef or any of the seafood specials.   Ask for Julie McFeely to be your server.   We met her about a year ago and she always takes incredible care of us -- but we've never had a bad server so you can't go wrong.    Enjoy.   This is best restaurant on East Blvd."}
{"text":"We met a couple of our friends for dinner here last Saturday night and had a good time.  Unfortunately their beer selection isn't very big therefore I ordered the 131 Mainiac cocktail and was pleasantly surprised by it since it was a little sweet but had a nice kick to it.  We ordered cornbread as an appetizer and it was fantastic!  I was fairly disappointed by the crab cakes that I ordered though.  They were salty and mushy.  I only ate one of them out of sheer hunger.  On the other hand, the shrimp and grits that my husband ordered were simply amazing!  The shrimp was seasoned and cooked to perfection and the grits just melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this place very impressive restaurant in Blakeney.  I would recommend this for small groups big groups couples and singles.  Parking is very good here there's a lot of spaces"}
{"text":"It was fine, pretty empty at 6:30 on a Saturday night which concerned me at first. So did the 92.5 sanitation rating.   Service was slow and confused. We had multiple servers and there was confusion on if we'd ordered drinks and appetizers and our main server pretty much grilled us like CSI on who brought our drinks because she had our ticket...man, woman? tall, short? tall like over...GOAWAY.   Food was good enough, I had the crab cakes they were two minutes away from being cold. My husband had the swordfish and the rice salad was delicious. Been there done that , won't be back necessarily. Much prefer the food, service and atmosphere at Bricktops in this genre."}
{"text":"We love this spot.  Good beer and wine to start and solid food.  The brunch is great, but not OTT.  The layout of the restaurant in an old Dilworth house is better downstairs than up, but the staff do a great job being attentive.  They have a true French rose on the menu which is a plus in my book.  Good execution all around.,"}
{"text":"Went back on Sunday & had a fantastic experience!  The food & service was phenomenal! 131 Main is back! :)"}
{"text":"My 'beef' (pun intended) with most up scale restaurants is a price to a quality and service ratio.  When the plate cost starts to exceed 300% of ingredients (Assumption of top notch crab, beef, etc), understanding overhead costs are a factor,  you have to ask yourself if other factors make up for taxation of folks who either can't cook or don't mind paying extra taxes. Having said that, crab cakes VERY Good (I know maryland..this is a pleasantly a different style, i plan on emulating for a fraction of the cost :) ....Smashed red potatoes, very good!.  beef (Filet and prime rib) mediocre esp. at $30/plate (Run up on valentines day).  All said, the service was the tipping (ha )as thats usually the 'insult to injury', but in 131's case, leans a fiscally conservative person like me going back on special occasions."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Maria was great and treated us like totality. The food was by far the best in town! Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food , terrible service not the place to go for a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Food is always great and consistent here. Great for an intimate dinner or night with friends. We love the cornbread, ribeye, and trout. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here.  Our waitress was super nice.  The food was pretty darn good too.  Out of 4 meals everyone liked what they got...the \"awesome\" roast beef sandwich, cheeseburger, shrimp and grits, and one of the fish entrees.  The cornbread app was yummy too.  Oh and the lemonade is fresh.  I give it 4 stars because, while very good, it didn't make me think about my next trip back.  I'm sure I'll be back at some point but I might try out a few other places first."}
{"text":"Wonderful service- waitress was attentive and the manager even stopped by a few times to make sure everything was perfect. The cornbread is completely OUT of this world. The chips appetizer is good, but impossible to compete with the cornbread which is worth the entire trip. The banana cream pie is heaven- after a meal you can easily split it with a person or two.. strawberry shortcake is just as good and not as rich. Ahi tuna salad is delicious! Large portion. Most solidly tasty plain burger you will find. Nothing special about the burger, just simple and great!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at 131!! Service snd food are amazing! I love their nightly specials...there is always several great things to pick from if I don't order from the menu.  Wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited 131 Main on a Friday night.  The management team would do wisely to start seating people closer to the front of the restaurant - there were plenty of people and a lively (though not too lively) atmosphere, but there was no way for us to know that walking in because everyone was seated in the back near the kitchen (and this is a big restaurant where you can't see through to the back very easily).  I know that makes for easier work on the waiters to be closer to the kitchen, but it also meant that my husband and I did not actually eat here until our 3rd time walking in the door when we were desparate for a table anywhere.  Lo and behold, we find out that this is a great restaurant with awesome food and other dedicated fans.  So if you walk in and are concerned that you are the only people there, don't worry, you aren't.  You will likely be seated with everyone else in the back.  But, service was great.  Regarding the food, it was mostly excellent.  I would say that beef is better than fish at 131 Main, though both were good.  My husband's side of rice pilaf was a bit of a let down in that it was trying too hard - everything else was on point.  You MUST get the cornbread appetizer.  You will look at the menu and say \"Really, $8 for cornbread?!\"  Yes, it is VERY worth $8.  It's a customer favorite, and now we love it too."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and I enjoy the food. Simple. Consistent. Tasty. However, it annoys me that this place is always A) catching on fire and B) catching things near it on fire. This is probably heightened by the fact I live in the building above the restaurant, but come on? Fish tacos are good. Love the metropolis salad. Hate the smell of smoke and fear in the back of my mind that my dog is dead."}
{"text":"131 Main is one of those restaurants I never get super excited to eat at-- but know the meal will be good, and I will be leave happy.   Surprisingly, my favorite menu item here for lunch is the veggie burger.  It comes with Havarti cheese (which I think is unnecessary)  and glazed in a sweet teriyaki-ish sauce. The patty is red from beets, and has a nice bite from brown rice.  Highly recommended.    The fries here are thin and crisp, the cucumber salad crunchy, savory and sweet.   The Thai steak salad is also very good (albeit pretty HUGE and almost overwhelming)   Dessert-wise, my friends and I have ordered the banana cream pie, and while it was indeed decadent and yummy, it was presented as a big glob on the plate, with messy drizzle.    Bottom line: think of 151 Main as a much, much nicer, fresher, more creative version of a casual dining chain."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to 131 Main on Saturday night for our Anniversary Dinner, we'd been a  few times before but never for dinner, only lunch. I started with the Pearfection martini- it was delicious, so good I had another with dinner. Our starter was the double-dip. It's a trio of pimento cheese, guacamole and salsa with corn chips. It was also really good, the pimento especially so. Where things started going south were with our main courses. My husband got the \"Big Island' Ribeye and asked for it to be cooked medium. When it arrived, it was cold and red inside and seared to a crisp on the outside. Extremely rare. He tried to eat it, but a few bites in, had to send it back. Meanwhile, my cedar planked salmon seemed to be going great. Well seasoned, the wild rice salad that came with it was great. However, when I cut into the middle of my salmon, I was bummed to see that it was also extremely under-cooked. I can eat a medium salmon, but this was fleshy and cold - ick. I ended up having to send it back too. What surprised me the most, was when my husbands steak came back.... it was the same steak! They put it in the oven and cooked it until it was well done. I couldn't believe my eyes, I've never seen someone not re-fire a fresh steak. There's no way a steak can retain it's moisture after being cooked once, rested, cut into, and then 10-15 minutes later thrown back into an oven! The same with my salmon. They took my salmon and put it back in the oven to cook further. Which resulted in it being extremely dry, especially on the outside portions. Our waitress was great when we first arrived, but then seemed to deflate as the night went on. I kept trying to reiterate to her that we didn't blame her but she just seemed detached and like she couldn't wait for us to leave. I hate when people blame the wait staff on their food not being well so I made a point to reassure her, but she didn't seem to care. She had the manager comp our dinners which was very kind, but I honestly would've rather paid the $104 for a well prepared anniversary dinner, than the $40 something we spent on drinks and apps.   Unfortunately, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I would've given it a near perfect score but it was so incredibly loud in there I couldn't hear my dinner parter talking! Turn down the music and maybe people wouldn't have to yell at each other! Dinner, fish tacos and shrimp and grits were absolutely amazing as was the brownie ala mode"}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week,  as we are new to the area.  The menu had a nice sampling of different dishes.  Our waitress Casey was great.  She knew the dishes,  was spot on in her recommendations and her service was excellent.  I really enjoyed the ribeye and the peanut butter desert.  The corn bread is a must try and a big serving."}
{"text":"My son's soccer team surprised 131 Main with a party of 26 about 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon.  We were quickly seated and our orders taken.  Of course, being a party of 6 families, we requested separate checks.  Parents were seated apart from their children and this didn't slow down the service at all.  Orders were taken and food was brought out unbelievably quickly! The food was amazing!! At the end of the meal, all the separate checks were even correct!  Fantastic hostesses, wait staff, management and cooks. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner and it was REALLY good. Second visit to 131 and it was as good as the first one.   On the first visit i had the Roastbeef Dip, which was good, this time we shared the Double Dip which was super tasty, big portion, the cheese dip is addictive. Had the artichokes too and they were equally as good.   The menu is not big, but a ton of variety. Look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Best ribs in Charlotte!!  And maybe the best ribs I've had in a restaurant anywhere. The bbq sauce is amazing!  Consistently good food and service!"}
{"text":"Chicken Tortilla Soup is my absolute favorite. I go every Tuesday to get my bowl. They may know me on a first name basis now. They should have it more frequently. Hey 131- I hope your reading this."}
{"text":"Great food and drink! Great staff and service! Being a pecetarian, fresh seafood is a must. No freezers. All fresh. My neighborhood bar! Our \" Blakeney Mafia \" meets every Tuesday night. Come on down!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for the evening. We checked the seasonal menu and decided this was the place to go. We did the dinner for two for $69 and couldn't have had a better experience!  We started with the amazing cornbread, then salads and then the Ribeye steak marinated in sweet soy and pineapple. We also received a free dessert with the deal and loved the banana cream pie. Everything exceeded our expectations.  We even asked the server for a recommendation on a bar to go to afterwards and she gave us three!   We will be back to this place next time we visit that is for sure."}
{"text":"The best! All of the food is delicious and the wait staff is very friendly. Great date night place. We are addicted to the kale salad."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday night because it was half price bottle of wine and we loved this place.  Food was delicious. We had grilled artichokes appetizer.  It was three large artichoke hearts with a dip. So good. Plenty for the three of us. Cakebread chardonnay and prime rib sandwich. We were in heaven. This placed was packed. But we had great service. Can't wait to go back and try something else. Got to be one of top restaurants in Charlotte.  Yum."}
{"text":"Not happy with our Mothers day visit. We were told 15-20 minutes to be seated. After 40 minutes without being paged, we asked the receptionist who informed us she wasn't sure why, but our name was already crossed off the list. After we were seated we waited 10 minutes to be seen by a server and then she only came back to the table after we were finished with our appetizer and dinner to deliver the check. Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte and this has quickly become one of my go-to restaurants. The food is consistently good. Our servers have never been particularly friendly, but they are generally quick and relatively attentive. I love the veggie burger while the bf enjoys the cajun penne. The double dip is meh.   As others have said, they can get pretty busy on the weekends, so definitely make a reservation. The fire pit outside is a nice touch as is the back entrance/ exit via Cu Copper (the bar behind 131 Main) for rainy days."}
{"text":"The best compliment one can pay to a restaurant is that no matter how many times I've dined there, I've never had a bad meal, nor have I endured bad service. I've been coming here for 3 years, and, in spite of 131 Main's one-page menu, I always can find something new to sample. And I know I won't be disappointed.  Highlights are the ribs, better than most ribs you'll find at your run-of-the-mill rib shacks, as well as the beef stroganoff meatloaf. Yeah, you read right...utterly delicious. But the jewel in 131 Main's crown is their banana creme pie, so sumptuous and sinful...and this is coming from a a man who tends to dislike banana creme pie!  And while it looks upscale, it's not very snooty. They offer an affordable lunch menu, and their Sunday brunch is quite fantastic. Go there. I said so.  (PS: this review is in reference to the Blakeney location, off of Rea Road)"}
{"text":"Short review to give praise to the crab cake salad and the key lime pie.  If you're trying 131 Main, both are in the 'must try' category.  You've never tasted pie crust like this - even in your mom's kitchen!"}
{"text":"Our eternal search for stand-out gluten-free dining brought us to 131 Main and while there were some bumps in the road, it was a pretty solid experience.  Fair warning, though, on a Saturday evening it is LOUD.  I'm talking order a glass of ice water or you will walk out with a raspy voice LOUD.    Salad: the ginger dressing had a nice little kick (gluten-free) and the creamy garlic was stellar (not gluten-free)  Mains: the ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, although a little too saucy (gluten-free), the prime rib was the winner of the table (not gluten-free) with the cedar plank salmon coming in a close second (gluten-free).  The crab cakes were good at first bite but proved to be too salty to finish (not gluten-free).  Sides: Shoestring french fries were classic (gluten-free), the coleslaw was fine (gluten-free), the smashed potatoes were solid but too much when accompanied by prime rib (not gluten-free) and the seasonal vegetable - asparagus - was very well prepared although we couldn't figure out why they felt it necessary to add breadcrumbs (also rendering them not-gluten-free).  The 'team' approach to service was a little frustrating with meals arriving at different times, the wrong items going to the wrong people (not to beat a dead breadcrumb, but that is problematic when dealing with dietary allergies) and a glass of wine arriving after the check was presented.  Overall, worth going back to, but maybe at a less hectic hour..."}
{"text":"The menu is straight forward with American centered flare. The pineapple/soy ribeye is always very good. My 10 year old loves that particular item. The bar has typical heavy pours so for folks looking for a fair drink, they will not disappoint.   The deserts selection is marginal though, they could use a refresh on those offerings.  Bottom line, 131 Main is a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"My family are cuisine hounds and spread the news about our experiences readily.  We're looked to for suggestions on places to eat.    131 Main will NOT be one of them.  Here's why - When the waitstaff is told to charge you $6 for a certified letter of a gift certificate and asks you 'So, do you want to order it or not?' bc they don't get a tip.  Now, That's what I call customer service!  Or Customer No Service.  Good luck with that."}
{"text":"My brother turned me onto this little gem. The food is out of this world. When we first started going the menu was a little limited. Now they have added more selections. I was very happy about that. My favorite still is the tacos. But every now and then I go for sea scallops. The wedge salad is ALWAYS a safe bet!! We've never had an issue with our food or service here. I highly recommend this establishment. The bar does get a little crowded later in the evening and a little loud, so I would not recommend this for children. But you can always request to be far away from the bar."}
{"text":"Drool drool drool over the grilled arichokes... Had that and a drink.... OMG want more......"}
{"text":"Loved it! I ordered the half rack of ribs and was not at all disappointed. The portion was generous, the price was great, and the food was excellent. The ribs were cooked perfectly, the meat was tender and fell off the bone. The fries were excellent as well, and they allowed me to sub in any side I wanted instead of the coleslaw for no additional charge. I went with the loaded mashed potatoes, which were definitely heavy, but very good as well.  The restaurant was fairly empty for a Sunday night, but I enjoyed the ambiance and I could smell the hickory BBQ grill the whole time - a nice touch while I was enjoying my ribs.  I'll definitely be back! I like to make reservations via Open Table, but the online reservation system on 131 Main's website was quick and super easy to use. I've heard rave reviews about the quinoa salad, so I'm excited to try it next time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to 131 Main for a while but never have had the chance until recently, when I was able to go to dinner at the Rea Rd location.  I was surprised by the building.  It is in a shopping center area on Rea Rd but the building has some nice architectural details and effort put into the look and feel.  The inside is very comfortable and calming and matches well with the exterior.  The service was also very responsive and polished.  I guess their cuisine would be considered new American.  Dishes were simple staples with some minor surprises, and everything I had was well executed.  I had the house salad, which was excellent, and grilled salmon on a cedar plan with a wild rice salad.  Everything tasted very fresh and was refined with a little twist.  The banana creme pie was phenomenal and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Main for dinner so I couldnt say whether there's a difference between lunch and dinner.  I had the cornbread appetizer as my entree and I dream about it.  Its that good.  My brother ordered it before I sat down and I kept eating it it became my meal.  I have to say Im not a fan of traditional cornbread and didnt want to try any.  I prefer bread/rolls to cornbread.  This isnt 'cornbread', the dry and crumbling kind its very very moist(like cake) with tiny bits of something(vegetables?) inside.  My brother had a steak salad he said was wow!  And my Dad had one of the better salmons he's had.  And that man knows his salmon."}
{"text":"I just had a great lunch at this Dilworth spot. As usual, the steak sandwich was superb.  I think it is the best in town.    What was unexpected was our food was slow to arrive (apparently there was a kitchen mix up), and the manager comped our entire meal.  She did not even know it was our anniversary!"}
{"text":"Second experience was fantastic. Food was wonderful. Loved the banana cream pie! Crab cakes were also delicious. The Managers Billy, Nick, and waiter, Sterling made up for our first experience. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place - I've been wanting to try it for a while.  I went here for lunch and the food was great!  We got the \"double dip\" for our app - it's a cold queso/guac combo with tortilla chips - so yummy!    I ordered the Maryland Crab Cakes w/a side of red cabbage with goat cheese crumbles on top.  Everything was spot on in this dish!  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  We decided to see what dessert was like and ordered the brownie.  It was one of the best brownies ever!  It was topped with vanilla ice cream and it was really perfect.  The prices are really reasonable for the quality of the food they give you along with the top notch service."}
{"text":"Their filet mignon is delicious every single time and you can not beat their smashed red potatoes!! Wait staff is very patient. Tuesdays is their half price wine bottles. You can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Left a Bad Taste.  The meal started out good with the appetizers but quickly deteriorated.  The shrimp and grits was flat and disappointing.  The prime rib wasn't prime, it was tasteless like cardboard.  I took it home to my dogs.  The desserts were pitiful.  the only good thing was the appetizers.  the corn bread was yummy, the double dip was great, and the salmon was decent.  I would never go here again unless it was for the appetizers."}
{"text":"My brother and S-I-L took me here over my Christmas vacation.  They said it was great and the roast beef sandwich was the \"best\".  So even though we were here for dinner, I had the roast beef sandwich.  I figured since they were both having a steak, I could taste theirs. ;-)  Okay... so without a doubt, one of the best, most tender, almost melt in your mouth dreamy good, roast beef sandwiches EVER!  How do they do that!!!   Steaks weren't shabby either."}
{"text":"My lady and I decided to jump in to restaurant week head first with a much anticipated visit to 131 Main in the Blakeney area off Rea Rd. Not necessarily an easy find off the main road as it's a standalone building right beside a rather large shopping complex, but it is a good looking location nonetheless with spacious seating both indoors and out. We already had reservations for 5:30pm on a Sunday evening (right in the middle of conference championship Sunday in the NFL, talk about sacrifice LoL) so we got in at a great time as it was much lighter volume of folks when we got there than when we left. The mood was intimate, adult atmosphere one suitable for a date. We started off with one lady waitress who took our drink order and broke down the menu but then she vanished and we magically got a male waitress for the remainder of our experience which a little odd but not off putting as they both were very attentive to our needs.  I've participated in restaurant week in Charlotte many times over the years because it can be a great way to eat fancy while maximizing your wallet. My only fear is that some establishments seem to use it as an excuse to offer scaled back, sub-par portions and\or quality for their offerings on special. Saying that, I'm pleased to report that 131 main did not fall into this trap. Their special for the week included a glass of wine (red or white) so we both got white which turned out to be a semi sweet pinot grigio which paired very well with the entrees on the list. For appetizers we elected to grab the double dip chips (guacamole\cheese dip combo with a side of salsa and fresh tortilla chips) and deviled eggs. Those two items along nearly spoiled my appetite splitting up 4 jumbo eggs and hearty basket of chips that we cleaned out which is the official seal of approval. For our main entrée she went with salmon (came with a kale salad side) and I went with prime rib (mashed potatoes on the side) Everything was very fresh and tasty. Meat fell right of the bone. The kale salad (which we admittedly both had our doubts about) turned out to be quite a hit. They gave me a cup of gravy to go with my mashed potatoes which I used to slightly dilute a thick serving. My plate also came with a creamy, horseradish type of sauce that we both avoid like the plague as it was much too strong for our taste buds. For desert she got a brownie and I got the key lime pie and by this time we were already running out of room in our bellys. To my chagrin, they bring out the most gut busting slice of key lime I've ever seen topped with mountains of whipped cream and graham cracker crumbles. The brownie was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, peanuts and drizzled in blend of chocolate\caramel. All in all, we both left feeling very satisfied with our experience.  Certainly deserving of its reputation and a place I'd be willing to visit again for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been dying to eat at 131 Main ever since I found out it is owned/run by the same people as PDQ in Tega Cay.  I mean people who can put that much love into fast food, must be able to do wonders at a \"real\" restaurant right?  Thank god I was not disappointed.  We chose 131 Main for our Easter lunch.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and clearly well trained.  We ordered a half order of the double dip for an appetizer. It is a plate of tortilla chips served with fresh guacamole, salsa and pimento cheese.  The pimento cheese was incredible, guac was great and the salsa just okay.  The half was the perfect size for two.   Hubs had meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Both were awesome.  I ordered the crab cake salad.  OMG - yummy!  Full of crab with no visible filler at all.  Not sure how they even get the crab cake to keep it's shape.  It's served with a mustard sauce that looks like it will be overpowering, but it is perfect.  Cornbread croutons are a nice touch.  Oddly enough, the highlight of the meal was probably the cheeseburger from my sons kids' meal.  Crazy I know!!!  It was a large burger so hubs and I tried it and it was incredible.  The flavor of the beef was awesome.  I never order a cheese burger at a restaurant and I could actually see myself ordering a cheeseburger there.  Fries were fresh cut and great.  Why doesn't every place just make fresh fries.  Really!!  They taste so, so, so much better.  The kids meals were topped finished off with Eskimo Pies.  My kids want to eat there every day.  I saw many people ordering the brunch specials which were french toast or eggs benedict with a crab cake.  Both looked incredible.    From the outside, the building is beautiful and if you didn't know the food was quite reasonably priced, you might think you were in a super fancy place.  Might intimidate some.  The interior is gorgeous as well.  Would be a great date location or place to impress clients."}
{"text":"loved...best seat in house was at the bar.  they recommended food and interacted and the atmosphere was electric"}
{"text":"On my last visit to Charlotte I was only there for 3 nights. Two of those three my husband and I had dinner at 131 Main...  My first visit early on a Wednesday evening. My husband prefers to eat at the bar because he likes to watch sports on the televisions and he has obviously been there often based on the fact that his name was called (much like Norm's on Cheers) when we entered the bar.  It is a very pretty, upscale restaurant with very friendly staff... Erin and Cindy were behind the bar when we arrived and Lauren took over for Cindy during our visit. These ladies are all friendly, funny and unflappable!  Even when we threatened to kidnap Erin and force her to live in our basement and make us her delicious margaritas, her only concern was if she would get to share them with us! LOL!  I had the filet with smashed red potatoes and the filet was awesome and cooked to the temperature that I ordered. I fell in love with the buttery, delectable potatoes! And although I hate to admit it, when I saw the generous serving of potatoes, I was sure that I would not be able eat them all, BUT I DID!!! (Needless to say, I was miserable after - but it was worth it).  My husband had soup (which I did not try, but he said it was delicious) and cornbread. Now I noticed that one Yelper mentioned that he could get cornbread free at a local diner and why would he order it here... It tells me that he obviously has not tried the cornbread here... It comes piping hot and delicious in it's own little skillet and I have NEVER had cornbread that is so delicious! If he knows of a local diner that is giving this stuff away for free, I would DEFINITELY be their best customer!  The friendly and attentive bar staff combined with great food and drinks won me over and we ended up spending the following evening back at 131 Main. There was a new lady behind the bar and it was almost 9:00pm on a Thursday, so there was no one else at the bar, which I would have credited for the excellent service if we had not had the exact same type of service the evening before when things were crowded.  This time we ordered the Danish ribs to share and I am pretty sure someone was playing a harp in the background every time I took a bite! They were tender and scrumptious! I ordered more of the smashed red potatoes, rather than the fries because I figured if I was going to have to wear pants with rubber in the waist for the rest of the week anyway, I might as well enjoy some more of their buttery goodness!  I have no doubt that this will be one of the places we visit when I make my final move to join my husband in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Don't got to this restaurant if you have a party bigger than 4. So to start reservations were made for seven and we were NOT told at the time we would have to sit at separate tables. This was for a birthday, who would be ok with that?   So we get there and we sit down confused at how they expect us to enjoy our full party of people when some will have to sit elsewhere. You may ask why not just move some tables together? The tables are stuck to the floor.   So we make it work and the birthday girl and her husband end up having to sit at separate tables. So while we wait for the food we have the idea well just come sit at the table with us and we can talk and socialize while we wait but since the table is not made for this many to eat we will use the other table to eat dinner. Well they just cleared the other table and sat people down there to eat without asking us if we were still going to use that table.   Like really? They basically handed her, her gifts that was sitting there on our other table as they just sit someone down. This was totally unacceptable. So we had to cram all of our plates. Ribs, steaks, shrimp and grits, etc. all on a little 4 side square table. We felt like grandmas house at thanksgiving.   The food was good yes it was but I was overtaken by the service that was received. I could barely enjoy my food as we all had to turn our plates ever which way to fit them on the table.   The thing that topped the cake was we had a new waitress. I know that we all start somewhere new but her excuse for everything she did not know, which was a lot I may add was \"I just started 2 days ago\". To me that means one thing you should have been trained better or longer before they let you by yourself. Don't use an excuse. Just plainly say \"Let me find that out.\" Just hearing that all night made me want to just go ask myself.   I am sorry if this was long but this was my first and probably last time coming to this location. I was just sideswiped by the service as a whole. The people were nice, food was good but important birthday experience ruined."}
{"text":"Gave this place a few tries and am decidedly underwhelmed by the service. The building is nice so that lures you in, but once inside, the service is abhorrent. I've given them at least half a dozen shots but each time I leave feeling like I'm never returning. Today, I sat at the fire fit to enjoy the beautiful weather around 4:15 on a Saturday. The hostess said the bar would serve us and to seat ourselves. Waited a good 10 minutes before finally walking inside to the bar to order drinks. Melissa said she would bring them out and sorry she didn't see us. Ok.   Ordered appetizers when she brought the drinks. A server/runner brought them  15-30 mins later and joked about how my glass had a hole in it since it was empty. We asked him to tell Melissa that we needed another round and a bottle of Pellegrino. 20 minutes goes by, we finish our food without so much as a drop of water and nobody stopping by to check.   When I went inside to pay the bill, Melissa said the server didn't tell her about the drink order and offered to comp the appetizers plus a round on the house if we wanted. I was ready to leave after such a long wait so didn't take her up on the offer for free drinks, but wondering why with only 4 people at the bar and 2 bartenders shooting the shit with the customers that someone couldn't have stuck their head out the door to see if we needed anything. Completely subpar, IMO.   Sitting on the patio at The Porter's House now. Excellent service so far, can't beat the atmosphere, free valet parking, and from past experience the food is top notch. Somebody pls smack me if I try to step foot into 131 Main again!"}
{"text":"we live nearby and this is our \"go to\" spot when we want good service and good food close to the house. We love the smoked salmon appetizer, as a meal, and the roast beef sandwich is truly awesome, ask for some raw horseradish to kick up the mayo (get both on the side and mix em up!) Not a fan of shoestring fries, so I usually sub them out for their garlicky kale salad. Truth be told, I have done take out before of 3 orders of just the side of kale salad for a full meal! I do wish they would change up their menu soon, while we love the staples we always get, nothing has changed on the menu in quite some time. Their salads are also good, and I think their pricing pretty fair. The only con I have to say is that if you are a small party, and maybe it's just me, but I feel like they really rush you through your meal to turn the table. We prefer to sit at the bar or the booths beside the bar to avoid this rushed feeling."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing places I have every eaten.  Food was amazing and service was impeccable.   Ribeye is to DIE for!"}
{"text":"Impeccable atmosphere with a menu that matches. Visited 131 on a family outing, and was happy to see veg-friendly offerings. Went with the Veggie Burger, the sweet soy glaze was unreal! Wether you're looking for a date night destination or a place to grab a cocktail (and the best guac around) after work, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"First the good. In general the food is excellent for the price. I have never had anything that I did not like and would not order again. The atmosphere is upscale American, can be a bit loud in the dining room, the bar is lively and the outdoor area with the fire pit makes for a great place to enjoy a pleasant evening. Now the bad and I mean bad, the bar service. I have never experienced this kind of consistently bad service in a bar. In general the staff is uncoordinated, more interested in talking with each other and just non-attentive to the clientele. On more that one occasion i have had to hunt down a bartender or server multiple times on the same visit. The staff seems young and generally uninterested, unprofessional and unprepared. I have spoken at length with the general manager and was very specific about what was happening in the bar but I have seen no change in behavior. This is a real shame because, despite all the good things about the place if the bar situation does not improve I may not go back."}
{"text":"We did call ahead and were told we would have a 25 min. wait which turned into an hour wait. We questioned ourselves on why we were even going to this restaurant again. It is so noisy we couldn't even hear each other. I couldn't' wait to get back outside!!  We prefer going out to dine - not just going out to get something to eat. The clientele has changed - it is more of a bar atmosphere.  The wait was much longer than we expected and the management missed the opportunity to recognize the many people that came in, but left immediately because of the long wait!  Management needs to recognize the people that made an effort to come to their restaurant even though they couldn't offer them a seat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have recently fallen in love with this place. When they first opened their menu was so-so and we never brought this up as an option for a night out.   We were tired of the same old stuff and gave it a try about a month ago and have been back twice since. Their menu is nothing frilly, just good solid choices ranging from lamb chops to a plentiful amount of seafood options.   They have a double dip appetizer with housemade guacamole, salsa and a \"cold queso\" that looks like pimento cheese but tastes like a well seasoned queso. Their salads are fresh and have tasty dressings, the Caesar is scrumptious.   We have tried multiple entrees from the lamb chops, Maryland style crab cakes and more. None of them have disappointed. My husband has settled on the fish tacos as his go to.   Tonight I had the special which was fresh swordfish overnighted from California (our waiter even told me the name of the boat it was caught on). It was covered in lump crab meat and lemon butter sauce. It was one of the best pieces of swordfish I have ever had and cooked to absolute perfection.   On Tuesdays their wine is half price which is always a win in my book. Although not the cheapest it is worth the price for a great meal and attentive service."}
{"text":"131 has always been my favorite restaurant until tonight.  We waited a long time for our food and then it was cold. The steak was rare, the prime rib sandwich was cold and the shrimp and grits were room temperature. The manager came to the table to bring back the steak and did not even acknowledge the issues we reported to our waitress.  There are too many restaurants in the area to waste my money on bad food. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with 131.  The food is consistently very good.  I find myself craving their corn bread every month or two.  One of my favorites in Charlotte.  They miss the 5th star because the do seem a bit pricey, and on our last visit, our waiter forgot about/ignored us...twice."}
{"text":"131 Main has been one of our favorite restaurants here in Charlotte since moving from NY 5 yrs ago. We experienced a decline in the level of service over the last couple of years, however we gave it another try tonight and it was by far the best experience we have had in any restaurant here in Charlotte! Everything was spot on from the time we entered and were greeted, to service, quality of food, and ambiance. Ben was our server. He was very knowledgable and helped us in selecting the perfect bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary . Nick the service manager was also very friendly and attentive and ensured we had the perfect experience. Timing of food delivery was perfection. Never rushed nor felt like we were waiting for a long period of time. We started with the cornbread appetizer accompanied with honey.  Not an item for calorie counters, but totally worth every pound gained! My husband had the wedge salad. He thoroughly enjoyed! I ordered the Main side salad. Perfectly dressed with an herb vinaigrette and topped with bacon and cornbread crumbles. For entrees my husband ordered the filet. Seriously the best piece of meat I have ever tasted!! Super tender and melt in your mouth delicious flavors! I ordered the trout and grits. No one does trout or grits like 131 Main! Delicious!! As full as we were we couldn't pass up dessert. We went for the only dessert we had yet to try here...the brownie a la mode. No words! Do yourself a favor and order! There is nothing ordinary about this brownie!  We have eaten at many restaurants throughout Charlotte including some of the best restaurants uptown. Still 131 Main remains our favorite. Thanks 131Main for an epic dinner experience! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"131 Main. Where do I start? It's New Years Eve. I call to make a rez...late I know. Of course 131 is completely booked! Totally understand and was expecting them to be. I'm so excited for them to be re-opened! I considered myself to be a \"regular\" at this place. Nothing on the menu that I don't love! Anyway, it's New Years Eve around 7pm my friends are in from out of town and actually beat me to the restaurant. So, I told them to put our name on the list because I couldn't make a rez earlier. I knew I was running late and it was too late for me to call ahead since they were already there. I get there about 30 mins after speaking with my friends. They were told about 45 miutes for the wait. This was close to 8 o'clock. Of course when I get there the waiting area is full of people, so we continue to wait. Names are being called, people from the bar are being seated, and we continue to wait. More names are called...more names are called...and more names are called. There were two women calling names for guests. One walked around calling names to make sure all guests are seated. We must have gone to speak with one of the two women at least three times. Once we were told our table was being cleared. The next time \"about 20 more minutes\". It's about 9:30pm at this time and the waiting area is almost clear. By now I'm completely embarassed for having out of town guests come to the restaurant that I have suggested and we're waiting this long. So, the last time that we check with the women working the books, they tell us some other group took our table. Imagine our suprise. We never heard our name called. No one walked around looking for us. I would assume that when you're going to \"steal\" someone else's table, you might wait to see if they're still in the restaurant at least. Or wait till the name is called a few times. We could clearly see our name in the book with a time next to it. Of course I wanted to take my friends somewhere else, knowing it would be just as crowded. The waiting area is completely clear, it's 10 o'clock and we're just being seated. 131 closes at 10pm. Talk about pissed. 131 should praise George, who I'm assuming is a GM. He offered us a bottle of champagne for our troubles. Then our first waitress comes over and suggest that we get a \"half-priced bottle of wine\". Excusse me?! George came back with the champagne and everything was okay for the moment. A different waitor came back and we ordered our two free apps. Skillet cornbread and the crab dip. Both very good. Another waitress comes to take our order. I happen to adore the fries here, so I order some as I always did. Waitress: \"we're out of fries\". Okay. I procede to order the scallops that I saw on the online menu. No scallops. One of my guests orders the roasted chicken. Waitress: \"we're out of chicken\". I'm distraught and pissed all over again. We order. George comes back to check on us (who is very entertaining), so I let him know that they are out of a few things. He says they're not. A young lady at the table next to us has a plate of fries. she couldn't have possibly bought the very last frie in the restaurant. George says the owner was there and the fries they had were too thick and he didn't want to serve them. We ended up with 4 orders of fries and they were all skinny like they are normally. Whats the problem? I know waitresses and waitors don't cook the food. What was wrong with double checking to make sure? She didn't have to go back there and cook. George also lets my friend know they have chicken, which our waitress also said they were out of. All I can say is thank you George for your great service. Everyone else needs to get it together. There's no way we were going to believe that \"some other group stole your table\" story. Please! I think thats called nonfeasance. I love this place. George, and George only, will make me a repeat customer after that."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and desert.the ribs are fall off the bone, prime rib 5 stars, scallops and grits delish"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time, and was definitely way too overdressed. I made reservations ahead of time, but when I arrived at the restaurant, I realized that I probably didn't even need one as there were many empty seats (this was on a Thursday evening). The interior is a bit outdated and dim, and I was sitted next to a large group of women who were LOUD. I could hardly hear my waitress tell me the specials.  I ordered the trout and it was WAAAY tooo salty...and I like salty foods. I could hardly eat it. The only saving grace was the complimentary valet and our very very nice waitress. I don't think I will come here again."}
{"text":"I was would have given 4 stars only because of a lost reservation. The hostess more than made up for it by giving us a great table. The lighting is dim and somewhat romantic. The food is actually very good. There aren't that many choices on the menu but what they do have they do well. The grilled artichokes are amazing and while some would discount the cornbread appetizer I implore you to try it. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with bits of cheese and corn and it's served with warm honey! The Filet is cooked to order and each member of the party ordered different and all  can exactly as we wanted. Hailing from one of the food havens of the world (California) this restaurant is a true gem. I will for sure be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! We come here regularly and have had just about everything on the menu. Our favorites are the Artichokes for apps as well as their Ahi Tuna. Don't miss out on the most amazing marinated ribeye I dream of this with their quinoa salad!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least 2-3 nights a week. Food always comes out fresh and hot and the selections are amazing. We always have excellent servers with smiles on their faces that are attentive. We never have a problem getting a reservation (open table app-amazing). We get the grilled Artichokes, Marinated Ribeye with either loaded mash or my favorite the most delicious quinoa salad. Highly recommend this restaurant over the one in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"One of the best fish dishes of my life. I had the special which was blackened mahi mahi with lump crab meat on top. The fish was plated on some amazing cheese grits and it had a corn salsa sauce on top....Simply amazing.   Service was good and the cocktails were on point as well. All in all, a nice date night with the wife. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a good experience when I went there the first time. The place was very beautiful and the service was great. I got to say that I will be talking my parents here for their birthday!"}
{"text":"We have been to 131 Main twice now. The drinks are strong, the service is great and the food is amazing! Definitely order the corn bread as an appetizer. You will be hooked!"}
{"text":"I have visited 131 Main twice and on both occasions, I left completely satisfied. Our server was pleasent and took the time to go through the menu as this was our first visit. I made a reservation (for the hubs birthday) through open table so we were seated pretty quickly. We had the creamed spinach dip for starters and that was some creammmmmmy goodness. It came with a batch of warm oven toasted bread which I liked better than the usual chips. For the entree, I chose the grilled trout served with herbed aioli and quinoa salad. The trout was meaty and nicely seasoned and instead of spreading the aioli on the fillet, I dipped bits of my trout in it and the combination was heavenly! The quinoa salad was also really nice.  Second time around, it was my mother-in-law's birthday so we decided to reserve a table in the back room. We wanted to be able to laugh and enjoy each other's company w/out disturbing other patrons. Our server Brian was great, he made small talk, cracked a few jokes and took our drink order. I ordered the double dip for starters and enjoyed it for real. The guacamole was chunky and the cheese dip was sharp cheddar with bits of bacon, and red peppers. A Fantastic combination!  For the entree I ordered the special; pan seared halibut served with a chilled wild rice salad. It was soooo good, The wild rice salad really stood out with the combo of cranberries, walnuts and rasins. It was a sweet-n-savory treat. For dessert they allowed us to bring our own cheesecakecreme icing  cake from yours truly-Harris Teeter, and served it to us after we sang my m-o-l happy birthday.   The only reason I didn't give them five stars is b/c althouh I made a reservation for my m-o-l's b-day celebration we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated. Reservation = no wait, gracias!  All-in-all, 131 Main is becoming a go to spot for family celebrations :-)"}
{"text":"Just had a spectacular lunch with my wife served by Shari, a really great server.  We were way too full to have dessert but Shari sold us on taking the strawberry shortcake home.  Boy oh boy, am I glad we listened.  That was a incredible treat!"}
{"text":"I can see how this place would be trendy. Since their fire/car accident incident(s) they seemed to have cleaned the place up. (Was looking a little shabby for a bit there.) The service has never been great - and we can never tell who our server is. They seem to do a \"team\" service type of thing, but it's flawed as they don't seem to communicate that well with each other, and they hardly ever smile. Definitely a scripted service routine, which is strange.  The food is actually not too bad. Priced right and tasty. Not original, by any means, but tasty. And I truly wish they could cook a steak - although that seems to be a Charlotte-wide issue. (Have only found one restaurant that understands what \"rare\" means.)  Will go back, but won't go out of my way to. Not one of those, \"Oh, you HAVE to go to...\" places."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, and this is the only Charlotte location we hadn't been to yet. 131 main is my husband and is FAVORITE restaurant and this is actually the best location!  The interior is beautiful and romantic and the food is always amazing. No matter what you order, it will be incredible. But the shrimp and grits are hands down the best meal I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Love the double dip, ahi tuna salad. My husband loves the ribs and we both like the fish tacos. Never a disappointment!  Consistent every time"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time tonight and felt like I absolutely had to write a review! The atmosphere was so cozy/romantic with not too dim lighting. It's very chic without making you feel like you're in a super fancy restaurant. The boyfriend and I decided to order the MAIN EVENT which basically includes- 1 app, 2 soups or salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert and a bottle of wine. This is all for $72. We both thought that was a great deal considering the portions are big and the food was delicious. We got the deviled eggs which were AMAZING. Idk what was in them but they were unlike anything I've ever had. We both had the soup of the day- mushroom/artichoke which was also so delicious. I got the lump crab salad and he got the rib eye. Both were SO GOOD. especially his... Which I thought was a little under cooked (but obviously still great) but he thought it was perfect. We finished with a HUGE slice of key lime pie. A lot of this, including the bottle of wine, we ended up taking home. Ton of food for a great price. At the end of our meal the manager visited our table and apologized for the steak being under cooked which completely caught my boyfriend off guard BC he was totally satisfied. She even comped our bottle of wine! The service was great- not too much not too little. Will definitely be back! Enjoyed everything here- everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Ballantyne... I'd highly recommend the corn bread and shrimp and grits.    Great staff and nice bar and dining room."}
{"text":"Update 8.29.16 - Restaurant is closed      Awe, this place was disappointing!  I ordered the potato soup, the grits, and mashed potatoes.   The soup was the only thing I could eat. The cheesy grits were over salted and the potatoes were dry and tasted like they were from a box.  My friend got the Tuna, it was over cooked and they called it sushi grade, but she said it was cheep and distasteful."}
{"text":"Ooh how I have enjoyed this place over the past 3 years residing in NC. The service is always stellar and the food hasn't disappointed at all on a normal outing with my family or with my girlfriends.  The only reason I must provide 3 stars is because there is no 3.5 star option. I had my birthday dinner here last year and made the reservations about 3 months in advance and after arriving it took forever to get our orders taken as we sat for 35 minutes before ordering, another hour to get the food and another 45-1hour to get the cake brought it which had everyone extremely tired from the long drawn out dinner and not interested in going out afterwards per the agenda. Plus our several was having a OFF night lets just leave that there as I don't like to put people out there if I had another experience with them and it was better and this is the case with the server in question. My go to meal has always been the Shrimp and Grits minus the pork. The husband and I have also done the dinner for two which is 3 courses and wine which was a great deal while out on date night. Unfortunately I haven't been able to experience the firepit as its ALWAYS taken when I arrive especially on Half Price wine Wednesday (I think it's Wednesday). Once I experience that I may update my review with better info and it may sway my STARrage ."}
{"text":"I have only been here for dessert, but dessert cannot get any better than 131's Banana Cream Pie. The graham cracker crust has a delicious hint of cinnamon, topped by chunks of dark chocolate, a nice thick banana custard, fresh house made whipped cream, and real caramel and chocolate syrup.  I'm not even usually a fan of banana cream pie, but this one is great!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Charlotte for NYC type ribs. IMHO it's almost a exact copy of Houstons without the taste."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  We have our favorite booth in the bar and splurge on chardonnay, grilled artichokes, and veggie burgers.  Veggie burgers a splurge you ask?  These veggie burgers are no ordinary \"garden burger.\"  If I closed my eyes and took a bite, I'd swear I was eating a bite of the best dang burger-burger of all time.  These things are out-of-control delicious.  Top it all off with the kale salad and a few fries and I am one happy camper.  Ahhhhh if only we could eat there nightly!  Baby even eats his broccoli here....(and he loves him some artichoke hearts!)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times because its close to where I Live. The menu is stale and the same old thing. The food is pretty good (nothing special) But is definitely overpriced. Good luck"}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation for 5 today.  Was told they changed their policy to not take reservations for more than 4 but we are welcome to walk-in.  That policy excludes my family so I'm excluding them from any future business.  What a shame."}
{"text":"My mother took me here when I was visiting from Dallas. She said this was her most favorite place.  It was delicious. I had a sandwich and my mother had a veggie plate of some sort.  All the food was fresh and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food atmosphere and service. Recently brought a larger group and the service worked well. Plenty of basic food choices and tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  Highly recommend the steak salad - its marinated steak along with a bunch of other stuff. I'm not a big fan of salad, but this one is fantastic. I order it with extra avocado.  Also highly recommend the scallop appetizer. Yummy!!!  And Tuesday's are half priced bottles - as in any of the bottles. GREAT deal.  This location isn't on Open Table. What gives?"}
{"text":"One word...Ribs! They fall off the bone and are so tasty! One of the more expensive items on the menu at $22, but well worth it. If I'm in a sandwich mood, which I am frequently, then I go with the roast beef, which comes with a nice side of au jus and horseradish sauce. Service is great and we normally just grab a seat at the huge bar and start with the double dip appetizer (half guac/half cold cheese dip w/chips).   Only 2 TV's so not the best place to catch the game, but the outdoor patio and fire pit make for a nice glass of wine on a cool night. And as other people have mentioned, the banana cream pie is one of the best desserts in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Melissa was a fantastic server but everyone that helped was fantastic. Smoked salmon was just as great or better than Houston's. Skillet cornbread not bad, has cheese and some corn inside. Fish tacos were swordfish, pretty good. Tortilla was toasted but a bit chewy. Queso dip was great, like pimento dip nice and has a kick. Double cut pork chop so huge and tasty. Loaded baked potatoe was great! They have Guinness !!! Dirty titi with blue cheese stuffed olives YUM made it my desert! WILL come back!!"}
{"text":"With my budget, 131 Main's prices are a bit beyond what I regularly like to spend on a meal (unless you want a sandwich), so we reserve our visits for special occasions.  Like my birthday.  And what a delicious birthday treat it was!  We went on the weekend so, of course, there was a long wait of about 90 minutes.  We didn't care, though, because (1) it was my birthday, (2) we were waiting for someone to arrive late, and (3) they had a bar.  While we waited, I had an awesome glass of red wine.  Or two.  By the time our table was ready, I was full of glee.  And tannins.    I opted for the pork chops...and I never order pork chops in restaurants.  I guess \"the other white meat\" still takes a second (or third) to other meat choices when I order.  However, because it was my birthday (I did mention that, right?), I decided to try something new and different.  And I was sure glad I did.  The pork chop dinner was probably the best pork chops I have ever had.  They were very thick and so full of flavor.  Upon a return to 131 Main on the next special occasion, I would probably bypass all other options and go right to the pork chops again.  They were that good and that memorable.  The mashed potatoes weren't half bad either!  I loved 131 Main's classy yet unpretentious atmosphere, too.  The dimmed lighting was just right and the decor was very modern."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From ambiance to food and service. Visiting Charlotte NC for the first time I yelped restaurants and found 131 Main. We had the dinner for two. You pick your app- get choice of soup or salad then pick your entre- wait it's not over! Then you choose your bottle of wine then topping off you get desert!  All for 72 bucks! In my neck of the woods this is a total bargin! Shrimp and grits for the first time and I'm in love! Make sure you request Mitch! The best server by far. Told us where to go gave pointers on different sections of the city to visit or hang out!"}
{"text":"Food was eh, ok. Ahi tuna salad was ok, timing was awful. Food came out wrong and took twice the amount of time to get it corrected, they did offer dessert to try to make up for it but by the time we got the food we were already late for our next plans. Instead of comping a drink or even the appetizer, we paid the full bill and were late for our next plans. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from my last. The general manager reached out to me the day I posted my review to go over our poor experiences and he was very apologetic and understanding. He asked my fiancé and I to come back in and give them another try after he addressed the issues. I was very impressed with the customer service. My review was handled quickly and we spoke immediately to try and get our concerns resolved. Last night, I made a reservation for my fiancé and I to come in and have a dinner to celebrate his birthday. Upon arrival, there was a Happy Birthday balloon waiting for us at the table. Very nice touch! The manager that was on duty introduced himself and also apologized for the previous poor experiences. Our waiter, Justin, was awesome! We never had an empty drink, his timing was always perfect, and the candle he put in the brownie dessert was also a very nice touch! The steaks were also cooked perfectly this first try this time! Overall, we were extremely satisfied with our most recent experience and will return to enjoy another meal at 131. Thank you Billy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The set up makes for a very romantic date spot with it's warm and cozy feel. I enjoyed all that the unique building design had to offer. Compared to the other locations, this one seems smaller, but did not disappoint. The BIG ISLAND RIBEYE was amazing. Tender, juicy and the flavors were pure perfection. Don't forget to check out the Peanut Butter pie when they have it. Truly to die for."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. We went here to eat not knowing what to expect. We were disappointed when the appetizer we ordered  didn't come out in a timely fashion, but the waiter realized this and comped us and then rushed out app order out to us. He was very nice about it and realized the mistake before we ever said a word to him. Mistakes happen and I think that the fix more than made up for the issue. The meals we ordered were excellent. The seafood was fresh and the crab cakes had huge lumps of crab meat in them. The loaded mashed potatoes are AMAZING and will bring me back again.  My daughter had a hotdog off of the kids menu (you have to ask the server what is on the kids menu since it is not published). The hot dog was huge and on a onion bun. She loved her entire meal."}
{"text":"The food was good. The burgers are the best. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The downside is that they do rush you. Also, the prices are too high. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Best pomegranate martini in the business. Food is typically really good. Curried corn is amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately recents visits have been not so good, this place seems like it's lost it's quality of food. The crab cakes have changed for the worse, they are no longer jumbo lump mounds that you would get in a place that knows how to prepare them. The last time I got crab cakes here, they were very small and had a horrible taste, almost as if they are mixing in fish for filler. I couldn't stand their flavor so I left them off the salad. Sorry 131, but I won't be back, there are way too many good restaurants around to settle for less than average."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My husband and I went for Easter brunch and the food and service was great. I love the dipping trio appetizer! They have a great selection of entree salads. I like their dinner and brunch entrees as well. I've been for dinner numerous times. They have a good wine list as well. I've never been disappointed with the food!"}
{"text":"Lunch was wonderful!  I met a group of friends for a Friday lunch at 131 Main and was craving a salad.  I ordered the Thai Steak Salad and imagined a bed of greens with light noodles, steak, and cabbage.  It was the complete opposite from what I expected and it couldn't have been better!  Noodles made up the base of the dish along with cabbage, steak (cooked to your preference - medium rare for me), and a nice portion of avocado and mango, all on top.  The hostess was very personable and jotted down the names of two friends who had not arrived when we got there, so she was able to show them exactly where we were seated.  Despite the uncertainty of knowing where the front door was, which seemed to be on the opposite side of the main parking, it was a great lunch spot that I'd like to try this place for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday lunch with his parents and Grandma. We were seated near the kitchen around 1 and greeted by our waitress Cassie with a smile on her face.   I really like the fact that they offer both Pepsi and Coke because it pleases everyone at the table.   We ordered the cornbread in a cast iron skillet with honey. It is wonderful! I don't even eat cornbread, but I will take down half of more of this cornbread because it is that good.   My husband ordered the wedge salad which, during this visit, he told me is the best salad he had ever had.   I ordered the corned beef and swiss sandwich with hand cut fries, and he ordered the chicken sandwich. Now, I'm not a corned beef expert, so I wasn't aware that the cooking time was medium rare. The meat had a really good taste to it, it's just cold meat is not my thing. I asked Cassie if she could just throw it in the microwave, really no big deal at all. But she was very apologetic, like they did something, which they did not, I'm just particular (picky *gasp*). After about 5 minutes the manager came over and apologized as well, really it was not a big deal, just not my thing. When I did get my new hot sandwich out, they also gave me brand new fries. It was excellent! Two thumbs, and eight fingers up, it was great.   Cassie was very attentive, as well as the rest of the wait staff. I may drink water like a camel, so I run out really often. I never ran out of water.  At the end of our meal the check came, and my meal was comped. Blew my mind. What turned into something that I felt I should have actually read the menu for, was a great gesture on their part. A little thing like that and we will be patrons over and over again.   I really applaud this establishment, and we will be back for many more brithdays to come."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte some years ago, 131 Main (East Blvd location) quickly became my favorite restaurant after meeting friends there for a birthday dinner and then returning multiple times.  I then saw it  close what seems like time after time due to I believe a fire and some other misfortunes.  Then it   closed for good :-(.  Well when I saw a sign go up around the corner from my house in Southpark I could not be happier!  Well now it   is open, and I went there for date night and it   was just as awesome as ever!  The cornbread appetizer is still to die for.  The food and drinks are amazing and I just love the ambiance.  The staff is also very kind and efficient.  We had an excellent dinner and will be back!  Welcome to the neighborhood 131 Main!"}
{"text":"We went to 131 during restaurant week.  Nice looking place, awesome outside deck with fire-pit. All dishes are really good. I had the rib-eye tonight and it tasted great. It did have a little more lig/tendon to chew than I cared for, but tasty...  The brussel spouts were great with a touch of crunch. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, but honestly it's been a few years. Last night, I went with two friends for drinks and some food. We were seated at a booth next to the bar. Our server came over within five minutes and we placed an order for our drinks. It took 30 minutes for three cocktails to arrive! In the meantime, we had ordered food, drank our water, and were just sitting there waiting. The first round of cocktails arrived completely incorrect, and it took another 15 minutes for the next round to come. I find this restaurant to be completely overrated and overpriced. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good diverse menu, great seafood options which seems to be a little harder to find in Charlotte. Fish is always fresh, some of the portions are a little large. Shrimp and grits were solid. Ahi tuna salad was great, just a little light on the Ahi and heavy on the salad. Have only had dinner 2x, not sure about lunch. Ambiance is good, dimly lit lot of dark colors and woods. Centrally located right on East Blvd in Dilworth but you'll need to valet to get a spot on the weekends"}
{"text":"Upscale ambiance. Excellent service. Correct size portions. All natural, fresh ingredients.  You can't go wrong with anything you order at this restaurant. Good setting for a romantic date."}
{"text":"I had been sick for over a week, stuck in the house, sleeping for days, and my mom calls to invite me out to lunch. I'm thinking something quick and casual, McAlister's perhaps? Not my mom's style. So off to 131 we go! I'm not going to lie, I voiced my objections: too fancy, overpriced, stuffy crowd, uppity waitstaff, but boy was I wrong!   We were greeted warmly, seated promptly, and the atmosphere was delightful. We ordered Earl Grey Tea which came in an absolutely adorable presentation (I'll post a pic right after this!) It was delicious and served with sugar and honey. I got a french dip, as anyone who knows me will tell you is my default dish when nothing else catches my eye. The fact that nothing else caught my eye is the only reason I give four stars instead of five. I love seeing surprising ingredients in a well-known dish or an unexpected menu item. Despite that small hiccup however, the food was phenomenal. The meat was lean and tender, the bread was fresh, the au jus mouth-watering and not too salty as it sometimes can be.   The atmosphere was the best part. I completely expected to feel out-of-place having been sick and mopey, but the warm tones, intimate lighting, and casual diners made me feel comfortable and welcome. The waitstaff was attentive and pleasant, and the prices were reasonable for an upscale restaurant. All in all, I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Getting Run Down and Smells!   Have gone to this 131 Main since it opened and have loved it for years.  As with any restaurant, hotel or business, at some point things need to be renovated.   Time to put some of all that money we spent back into the freshening up the restaurant.   It smells and tables, seats and restaurant in general showing its age.   The table we sat at last month was pealing all over the top and was  scratched up.   VERY DARK LIGHTING CAN'T COVER IT UP ANY LONGER!   I was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.    Also, with changes in management we had the worst service (first time we had bad service there in 8 years) we've ever had.     Get your act together 131 Main!  Don't rest on past success and renovate for the future!!!"}
{"text":"David and I really like 131 Main. This location has a nice layout - great bar, great patio, and nice dining area.  Service has always been good.   On my last visit, I tried the Ahi Tuna Salad (with mixed greens, fresh mango, avocado, & ginger vinaigrette) for $15.   This is a great place for date night or for meeting friends on the patio for appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"It's good but not as great as it thinks it is. You'll get a good meal but pay 25% too much and its not very memorable. Service was very good and atmosphere is nice but reflects that it is a local chain and is a bit soul less. Food was good but salty and nothing special. I doubt you will have a bad experience. But mine wasn't quite good enough to want to go again."}
{"text":"An amazing dinner of grilled salmon and filet medallion for our anniversary.  The service was more than 5-star and the food was cooked to perfection.  You simply MUST save room to try the banana creme pie...heavenly!"}
{"text":"Less then stellar steak.  Typically the food is above par, but tonight's ribeye was something I expect from Chili's.  Not sure if they have a sub-standard cut of steak for their $69 \"dinner for 2\" or I just got a really greasy, fatty, overly charred Food Lion steak."}
{"text":"These guys had a fire, so totally re-vamped the place. It has very dim lighting/ romantic lighting. Throw in a few bottles of wine and an amazing key lime pie --- ummm, I'm sold!  They have this great deal for two... I believe its any night, but we went on Sunday. 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert (dessert should always be shared).   $65 or something crazy for two."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good as usual. But on this visit, the service was terrible. I was in for a late lunch, around 1:30. The place was nearly empty, and there were many servers just standing around talking. Yet no one came to my table for about 15 minutes! Even if it was the hostesses fault, and she didn't assign a server to me, every single server ignored me sitting there looking around like \"Hello??\" And even when I did get a server, some 20 minutes after I had sat down, she was terrible. Distracted, inattentive, got just about every little detail wrong with my order."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They don't have a freezer except for ice cream because everything is that fresh.   If you like fish this is the place to eat it for sure. Whether you get the cedar plank salmon which is large enough to share unless you are really hungry or the fresh catch which is flown in fresh. Boat to table. We like to ask the name of the boat just for fun.   If you have room for dessert their speciality is Banana cream pie but we like the chocolate dessert or key lime pie best."}
{"text":"I never stopped at 131 Main in the past because I always thought it was too upscale to just stop in and grab lunch.  It always looked to me like this is a place you make reservations to go for dinner or a place you go for lunch and drop $20 per person.  I was pleasantly surprised when we were able to sit down for a casual lunch and the prices were about average for a sit down restaurant.    The indoor dining area looked very nice and comfortable but we sat outside.  I thoroughly enjoyed their outdoor seating since we had such amazing weather.    The service was great.  All the servers were very attentive and they used a tag team approach at our table.  Our drink glasses were never less than half full.  The food was pretty decent.  We started with the cast iron cornbread which was a huge portion (can easily be shared between 3-4 people) and pretty tasty.  I went with the cajun fish sandwich for lunch and the hubby got the club sandwich.  I couldn't taste too much cajun spice on my fish, but it did have a good flavor (although it was a little too salty).  The fish sandwich could've used a little more sauce of some sort in my opinion.  While the hubby's club sandwich was just your basic run of the mill club, it was still quite delicious.  The best part about our meals were the thin cut not too crunchy but not too mushy fries.  They were wonderful.  The food didn't impress me too much, but the service and atmosphere will bring me back.  Not to mention I haven't had a chance to try their banana cream pie yet."}
{"text":"I have always thought of 131 Main as one of those restaurants in a jinxed building.  It has been a couple of different restaurants, it seems goofy, it has a corporate vibe.  Talk about a surprise today.  I went in this morning, had glass of sparkling and a smoked salmon platter on the patio.  It might be one of the best smoked salmon platters ever!  It seemed like it was smoked in house and a huge portion!  It was served with a lovely caper aioli and toast points.  We asked for red onion and capers.  You can also order a bottle of sparkling for $21.  Talk about a yummy brunch.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Our server was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Being from the Mooresville area, I was first introduced to 131 Main at their Cornelius location. I was so happy they decided to put one on East Blvd here in Charlotte. My go to meal is the Thai Steak Salad, which like it's name is heavily Asian influenced. The steak is nicely seasoned & in plentiful \"chunks\" of steak. Also, you can't go wrong with the \"double dip\" appetizer (tortilla chips & a guacamole & pimento cheese mixture), the cast iron scallops, the cornbread, or, when the have it, the smoked salmon. I've also had the prime rib, roast beef sandwich & the crab cakes before. The ambience is casual & I love that the waiters / waitresses are dressed in all black (classy!) & are knowledgeable about the menu. This place is perfect for friends, dates, groups or families."}
{"text":"Ok. 4 stars for a solid meal. The menu has a little bit of everything, it's a nice setting, the service is top-notch, the beer selection is decent, the desserts are slammin', and that cornbread app is freaking awesome. I enjoyed the grouper and several New Belgium Rangers, but I don't want to spend my time on the food. It's great, so know that. You'll be happy with most everything under this roof. However, I want to spend my time on HOW DARK IT IS INSIDE. I needed my friends to wear bells so we could locate where their table was.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not mad at all. I rather enjoyed the setting. I found it so comically dark, though, at our table that I actually used my phone as an added light source for my friend to read the menu, the bill, and even the cards in my wallet. My eyes didn't want to adjust hardly at all throughout the meal. I think all of us commented on how low the lighting was. It was so cozy that I wanted to ask for a few more napkins, kick back at a booth, and take a nap. It really closes you in, too. You feel like you're in your own dining room with nothing but candle light. A nice touch, but you have to be ready for it. With some of the bar staff opening the door to the setting sun, you may feel like a hibernating mammal being rudely awakened. Sunlight, kindly stay out of the dining room.   Immensely enjoyed my first visit with 131 and only wish that I had done so sooner."}
{"text":"OMG... I've eaten here several times but was too tired to go out after a 11hr Flight. Since I have had their \"Shrimp & Grits\" dish on my mind the last 3 days, I decided to try Door Dash delivery for the first time and I am so glad I did. My dinner arrived on-time and the taste was still the same as I remembered... quality was not lost due to delivery... it was simply scrumptious even in my little white TO-GO box ."}
{"text":"131 Main is a good choice for lunch among many impressive restaurants in the East Blvd area.  On an afternoon this week, they were surprisingly quite slow and we were greeted by excellent service and a quality, yet semi-quick meal.  It was a bit awkward when we first sat down to the business lunch and the lighting was so dark that it was more appropriate for a romantic evening.  I opted for the fish tacos and switched out the beans and rice for the side of kale salad.  The tacos were good, yet average for the fish variety.  The slaw was underseasoned and the salsa served on the side looked and tasted just like the supermarket out-of-a-can variety.  The kale salad, on the other hand, is well developed with the perfect combination of fresh kale, parmesean cheese, and a few scattered bread crumbs.  If you're vegetarian, request the vegetable plate (not listed on the menu).  I am most impressed by their selection of side items (kale, purple cabbage, slaw, cucumber salad, quinoa, wild rice, and gazpacho)."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants that my wife and I always end up coming to because its consistent with good prices and we know we'll have a great time.  They have a great wine list and amazing prices on quite a few bottles.  I saw a few pinot noir's that you'd have a tough time finding at a store for the price.  There menu has something for everybody and there wedge salad is amazing.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We come here often. The food is always delicious, but the service is even better. From the hostess to the wait staff to management. It is A1. I normally get the salmon which never disappoints"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food to match. Fish tacos were delicious and the lamb was perfect. Our order came out quickly and our server was efficient and friendly. Atmosphere was quiet and cozy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in CLT.  The appetizers are really the gems here...  Double Dip, Grilled Artichokes, and oh my... the Smoked Salmon... simply Amazing!  Entrees are typically above average and service is on par.  Nice atmosphere and great for a nice evening out!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have something I dislike on the menu. My family and I have been going here for years and everything is excellent, from the service, to the wine, to the food, to the atmosphere. It's great for so many occasions. Hit the bar if you want a drink after work and try the pimento cheese and guacamole double dip. Go with your family and everyone share the cast iron corn bread. I'm in love with their salmon and their asparagus, but there was a time I'd always get the Thai steak salad. I'm not vegetarian but there are times I crave their veggie burger.  If you are celebrating, come here for desert. I love every single desert I've had and can't choose a favorite."}
{"text":"After years of living in Charlotte, I can still say this is my favorite restaurant.  The food is always amazing. Some favorites are the cornbread, the dip appetizer, the main salad, prime rib sandwich, and the key lime pie.   I no longer live in Charlotte but anytime I'm nearby I make it a point to stop and have dinner here.   The only negative is they got rid of their main event couples dinner special. PLEASE PLEASE BRING IT BACK!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to have a cocktail here. :-("}
{"text":"131 Main used to be our to go place for special occasions.  However,  since May 2015, the quality, quantity and price have changed quite a bit.  We used to love love their food  - ballantyne location. Ever since their prices increased,  the quality has decreased.  Used to love their Wedge Salad. The quantity is less, and the taste is not as delicious.   Did the Ballantyne location change chefs?  If so,  we won't be returning.  We've been eating here since they opened in ballantyne."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I had been there once or twice before the infamous fire that shut this famed Charlotte gem down, and was definitely anticipating its return as I often drive by there.    My most recent trip found me at 131 Main for my graduation celebration - nothing crazy, just a few family members for a light \"lunner\" after the graduation ceremony at UNCC.    Per my two most recent visits to 131, I went with the crab cakes.  I don't know what it is, but I was having crab cake withdrawal lately and 131 was the perfect spot to scratch that itch...    Our server was extremely patient, cool, relaxed, understanding, etc, as my family strolled in late, and at various times.  Nonetheless, she was patient and accommodating to all that were there.  She was very flexible and accommodated my family's weird requests.    I love the new 131 since its reopening.  I will say, I am not a fan of the new, low, bar ceiling.  It feels tight in and around the bar area because the ceiling is so low.  Otherwise, this reincarnation of 131 Main packs all the service, great tasting food, and ambiance as the original.  ....Oh and the crab cakes were orgasmic - sex for your taste-buds..."}
{"text":"Staff all very nice. Work as a team. Venue very nice traditional supper club. Had a delicous smoked salmon appetizer.  Mimosa was also a good start. . Marinated ribeye.  Tastey. Prime rib-excellent. Large portion. Done just right. Au jus great. Also creamy horseradish. Not something I like. Both had mashed potato sides. . We've determined neighborhood restaurants beat uptown."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! We just celebrated our 30 year anniversary here. The meal was excellent and Ryan our waiter was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so my shrimp and grits really deserve 5 stars, they were that delicious. As a Louisiana native, I know my shrimp and grits and 131 Main's execution of this dish was fantastic. The restaurant is really more of a 3-4 star place though. The menu is boring. There's just no other way around it. If I hadn't ordered the shrimp and grits, there wasn't anything else I wanted on the menu. Now that's sad because I love food! Porkchps, ribeye, meatloaf? I make perfect versions of that at home. This menu is so Houston's in 1995...was there even a Houston's in Charlotte? Frankly, the atmosphere is so Houston's circa 1995 as well. Heavy, dark dining too with an aloof staff and loud kitchen...no thanks. Judging by the depth and layers of flavor in my dish, the chef here is more than capable of putting out some wow dishes. The menu is desperately in need of some creativity and revamping. Especially the sides. The side menu is sad. So sad. The apps too. We got the double dip and again it was great for what it was...yummy guacamole and pimento cheese with tortilla chips. BUT, this is so boring. Delicious but boring. Guac and tortilla chips, really? Did I mention that their soup of the day was loaded potato soup? I'm surprised loaded potato skins weren't on the boring, outdated app menu. 1995 called, they want their menu back."}
{"text":"Where to start?  First, the restaurant was not what I was expecting.  My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner.  I had heard about this place on the radio many times and was thinking it was somewhat upscale and would make for a romantic dinner.  We went on a Saturday night and did not make reservations.  We were expecting a wait and there was one, about an hour.  We really wanted to try the place, so we waited in the bar and had some drinks.  The bartenders were nice enough.  They took a little while to refill drinks, but they were busy and that is understood.  I thought it was odd that there were TV's in the bar area.  I felt they took away from the ambiance.  They were distracting and the only ones who seemed to be watching them were staff members as they walked by.  If I were management I would remove them or at least turn them off at dinner time.  Once we were finally seated we ordered the cornbread skillet.  While the top was very yummy, the bottom was covered in flour, chunks of flour.  It was gross, but we don't like sending things back, so we scraped the bottom and ate it.  Our waitress did the right thing and saw the mess at the bottom of our pan and comped the appetizer.  This is why they got 3 stars.  Between the 2 of us we ordered a soup, salad, steak and fish tacos.  They were all delicious.  The server was very sweet.  I don't know if I would go back though.  It is very pricy for a casual night out ($15 hamburgers) and I don't think has the right atmosphere for a nice romantic dinner.  They're kind of somewhere in between the two."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Today they got greedy and Adam had a snarky attitude. They offered a special \"Mothers Day\" menu that excluded many typical favorites on the menu and charged dinner prices for lunch. Adam could have ruined my day with his condescending attitude...if I would have let him."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch with my boss, who frequents it often. We got there right as they opened because they get so busy. We were greeted and taken to a quiet booth where we could chat. I'm currently doing the Whole 30 program so I'm pretty limited on what I can eat. The only really compliant item on the menu is the salmon with asparagus. I explained to the waiter about my current dietary limitations and he was very obliging. I'm honestly thankful for whole 30 because if I wasn't doing it, I wouldn't have ordered the salmon because I almost never do when I'm out. Goodness gracious, I swear to god it was the most perfect piece of salmon I have ever eaten. It was lightly seasoned and perfectly grilled. I'm still dreaming of it. I'm excited to go back after whole 30 and try some other items but honestly if I go back, I'll probably be getting the salmon because it's that good! Highly recommend!   I also really find it fascinating that all their food is brought in fresh daily. They literally don't even have freezers in the restaurant. I love that."}
{"text":"Love everything at 131! The Ahi tuna salad is perfect for  a light lunch. The crab cakes are wonderful. If you're in the mood for a sandwich, try the prime rib sandwich with au jus and horseradish."}
{"text":"I rarely write bad reviews - but tonight we had a reservation for 6 for my friends birthday at 7:30.  All six of us arrived about 10 minutes early and we were told it would be just a few minutes.  By 7:40 they told us that they were cleaning off the table and it would be just another moment.  By 7:50 they told us that the previous diners were still at the table and they couldn't give us a time.  By 8:15 (still not seated) two of us had to leave because we had to work and there was no way would would be seated and eat by 9 - all in all, very very very poor management.  I will never go back here and would be hesitant if you make a reservation with them - what is the point of a reservation if you have to wait an hour?"}
{"text":"Terrific food, service and setting. Especially attractive $60. multiple-course offering that includes a bottle of wine with appetizer, salads, entres, desweet."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate her birthday dinner here. We both had the crabcakes which were fabulous. She chose the strawberry shortcake for her birthday dessert and it was great too. Great food and service. Bonus points since they take reservations. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"My return visit to 131 Main after I was invited back (last visit can be erased in my book) was phenomenal in all regards.  The food: The artichoke appetizer is light yet satisfying. It is seasoned from the grill and comes with a remoulade sauce. The herb roasted chicken is tender, flavorful and with the mashed potatoes it felt like home. My friend had the fresh tuna special with the Asian slaw and loved it. For dessert it was the banana cream pie and there wasn't a bite left. The service: Our server, Tara, had the perfect suggestions for everything we ate as well as for wine pairings. Please see her when you visit- she made our night fantastic! We were so well taken care of by her and the other staff members that we will be back soon. Thank you for an evening that left nothing for want- this is the 131 Main we know and love!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered two ahi tuna salads to go--$45 after tipping the girl who was supposed to check the contents. The soy sauce containers weren't closed and had emptied into the lettuce, the mango wasn't ripe (very hard and added no flavor), and on one of the salads, the tuna was totally inedible (total gristle). We tried to call the restaurant, but could never reach a manager. We will never do take out again, which is sad, because this is one of our family favorites.   Update: Upon receipt of my email, the manager promptly contacted me (2-3 times) and was insistent (kindly) that he make things right. He did not want that experience to color our long-standing positive view of 131 Main. He made a generous offer to make us whole and gave me his personal cell, should there be any problems in the future. He is everything a manager should be. I really appreciated his kindness and thoughtfulness in handling the mess up."}
{"text":"Service was very below par tonight. Took a long time to get our bread, which was quite bland. 3 of our meals came out within a reasonable time, but then we waited at least 10 minutes for the other 3 meals. Overall very slow service. My Thai steak salad was OK, but not that great. So a disappointing evening."}
{"text":"Went to131 main  my first visit during restaurant week on 1-27-18.  I was early so ordered a beer at bar. Very busy at 430 and both bartenders acted like would rather be somewhere else.  On to the dining room.  First thing is it is very dark, little lights pointing from ceiling , maybe romantic for some but rather cave like to me. Moving on to service and food. Waitress was nice,  professional  , and great service. Got the ribeye, cooked perfect med well. French fries for the side, which are tiny shoestring fries, come on give me a baked potato that they do not offer. I do not think I would go back. To many other restaurants with better food."}
{"text":"The food has always been consistently good and the service at the Dilworth location has been great. BUT that Rea Rd location is the worst. Twice we've not even stayed to eat. There seems to be 4 or 5 hostesses and they stare at you like you've got Ebola instead of asking if they can help you or how many in your party. I guess you can do subpar service when your tables are full."}
{"text":"Huge portions. The prix fix special can really feed a family of four. Also comes with a bottle (yes a whole bottle) of decent  wine.   We shared the double dip which consisted of guac, cheese dip and salsa. It's really a triple dip. This alone would feed all of us. The guac is rustic with nice fresh chunks of avocado. Not a fan of the cheese dip but the salsa was nice and zesty.   I had the seared ahi tuna salad which was delicious. I like my seafood served with a nice amount of acid and the dressing definitely delivered.   My family had the grilled trout, the cedar plank salmon and the ribeye. The trout had a nice char, the salmon was nice and moist ( a little undercooked) but I like it that way. The ribeye was salty but tender. We also shared a huge slice of key lime pie at the end.   Great food, service and bang for your buck. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I went here for a networking interview for lunch today, and was very impressed with the food, staff, and atmosphere.  I would definitely return for another visit - for business or pleasure.  I was very impressed with the waiter's ability to be attentive and fulfill his duties without unduly interrupting the conversation.  It's nice in any circumstance, but was even more appreciated since it was a business lunch.  The professionalism and courtesy of the staff was also made evident when the my party was asked very nicely by the manager to switch to a neighboring table so he could accommodate a larger party. To recompense us for this small request, he provided free coffee and dessert to the table.    Even during a pretty busy lunch shift, the restaurant wasn't too loud for a business or social lunch.     The food was good, but there were a few weak points.  I ordered the grilled salmon and zucchini strips.  The zucchini was little overdone and the salmon was little underdone, and the portions were pretty small.  Some sort of starch side would have rounded out the plate. However, the comped dessert (banana cream pie) made up for it and then some."}
{"text":"Average...dry salmon, regular sides..nothing great. But gotta live with what's around in Lkn."}
{"text":"131 Main is one of my family's favorite restaurants, but someone in the family has food allergies, which makes us not able to go often. I took my daughter here, and this is our review. For our appetizer, we got the double dip. It comes with pimento cheese, guacamole, and salsa, with fresh tortilla chips. The pimento cheese has a great texture, and a very nice flavor. The guacamole was also great. The salsa has a great flavor, and you can tell that everything was all super fresh. Even the chips taste fresh. I recommend mixing everything together, especially the salsa, it makes almost a nacho. For my entree, I got a burger with bacon, cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomato. It came with French Fries, and the P&G slaw. I got the burger medium well. The burger was very flavorful, in a good way. It also has just the right amount of toppings. The French Fries were good, but not great. I prefer waffle fries, or sweet potato fries, but these are very thin shoestring fries. The P&G slaw was very unique, but I am glad I tried it. The coleslaw actually has a peanut butter base, instead of mayo. It actually works very well. Sometimes you don think of peanut butter and vegetables as a good combination, but this restaurant makes it work. My daughter got the kids burger, it was actually the same thing as the regular burger, just cut in half. She got hers with lettuce and tomato. She said that the burger was great. It was very juicy, and was cooked perfectly as far as I could see looking at it. Her burger came with one side and she chose fries. She actually likes thinner fries, so she thought the fries were great. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake was the star of our dinner. There is only one bad thing about it, they only have during the spring and summer. That is why we need to get it every summer at least once. The biscuit is not too overpowering and sweet. It allows the strawberries to really steal the show. The strawberries always taste great and fresh. I also love the fact that they put on some mint on top. It gives it a touch of freshness that you don't get in a normal strawberry shortcake. The service here is great too, everything came out very fast, and we were able to walk in on a Friday night and get a table with no reservation."}
{"text":"The New Zealand salmon was the freshest that I've ever had. ALL of the sides (curry sweet corn, brussel sprouts, string beans, deviled eggs) were seasoned to perfection. The wait staff is so pleasant. Extremely pleased."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. I suggested to my close ladies at work to have lunch here today to celebrate one of girl's bday. They all love 131 Main. They love the food and Julie was great with us."}
{"text":"One of the things that I wanted to do when I hit town was scrape around to a few different sides of town - and while I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to explore Dilworth, I did make it a point to grab dinner here on my way out for the evening.   What I found was a perfectly cozy corner stop, featuring what appeared to be a decent wine list, a carefully selected cadre of brews, and a menu full of rich new American staples. 131 Main won't refresh your take on modern American cuisine, but it might well remind you what you like about it. I had my way with the roasted chicken, paired with some really surprisingly tangy braised cabbage, and washed the whole thing down with an Olde Copper brew. Whether you're content to warm up to the bar and savor a glass of wine or belly up like I did and tear into a new take on some classic fare, there's a decent chance this spot will send you on your way smiling."}
{"text":"Sad to say I was racially discriminated here. It kind of felt like I was on the wrong side of town. We walked in the restaurant quietly and sat down. The waiter rudely didn't even mention her name and just went on to ask us what we wanted to drink. She didn't even want to make eye contact with me as I was giving her my order. She would either look over my head or in some other direction my way but not directly at me. This type of body movement and behavior was being noticed so it was pretty bad.We had been sitting there so long with the menu that we already knew what we wanted to order so we did. We placed our order. My friend off the back told me that the waiter did not want to serve us and that she had an attitude. I didn't catch it at first but I let her continue On. When the waiter came back she said, \"if you didn't put your order in already I would have told you the specials\" (in her snappy voice as if i did something wrong for knowing my order after they took 15 minutes getting to my table).  She clearly overheard our conversation And realized she had messed up and was trying to make up. We listened to the specials and said thank you. I asked for some complementary bread because we were starving and I had a feeling it was going to be a wait. Boom! Server gone! Another server came around and introduced herself and said she will be taking over her table. It was just about 9 o'clock on the dot and we thought the other server had gone home and tried not to jump to conclusions. We also paid attention to the other waitresses who were waiting around us and the rotation of their tables. Our new server was very pleasant and handled all of our needs and requests.  At the end of our meal as we were receiving our checks, I asked our new waiter why did we receive a new waiter. This b**ch had the nerve to tell me some BS and say that they rotate waitresses as if that's even possible. She was saying one person will get the drinks, and one person will take the food order. This was totally BS and no way possible all this could work in restaurant because it's too damn confusing!! You'll be yelling around the room hey Ashley did you get my drinks hey Sam did you get the cheese sticks?? After that dumbass answer I was completely over the restaurant and really figured that we were in the wrong side of town. Ha! What's funny is, our original waitress with helping another table across from us! I know I'm black, but I'm not ghetto. I know why am black, but we were going to tip you. I know why am black, but I deserve good service too."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my wife and me on her birthday. My overall opinion - It was okay. I had the ribeye. It was okay. My wife had the salmon. It was okay. The cornbread app - It was okay. The dessert - It was okay. Service was really good."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Atmosphere was incredible, and the service was 5 star for sure!  Thank you 131 Main. We will certainly be returning soon!"}
{"text":"At a girlfriend's suggestion of \"the kids have a sitter, let's go eat!\", I met her for lunch on a Saturday at 131 Main in Blakeney.   After a call to her of \"where in the hell is this place?\", I found the standalone building towards the back corner of the shopping center.  It's a beautiful building with lots of parking, with both indoor and outdoor seating.    We arrived around 11:30 and were seated immediately and quickly greeted by our waiter.  He had suggestions and was able to answer our questions about dishes easily.  It's nice to have wait-staff who can tell you what their recommendation for best dishes are instead of \"well, I like everything...\".  And if you like ambiance (ambiance = darkness), this is the place for you!  We sat at a comfy booth and had plenty of room for food and drinks without shuffling items around throughout the meal.    My lunch date ordered Gazpacho ($5) as an appetizer and it looked delicious.  A large bowl of tomato-ey goodness with a drizzle of sour cream (?) through it.    For our entrees, she ordered the Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich ($16), which is served with au jus and shoestring fries.  She said the sandwich really was awesome.  I ordered the Corned Beef Sandwich ($13) with fries.  The waiter volunteered to me that the \"zesty slaw\" served on the corned beef sandwich was indeed zesty, and when I made a face he offered to have that put on the side.  It was zesty, although not overpowering, but I am glad that I got it on the side so it didn't sog my sandwich down. My sandwich was absolutely delicious!  The corned beef was not stringy or tough at all, and the sauce, cheese and slaw (which I added small amount of to the actual sandwich) complimented it so well.  Best corned beef sandwich I have had in ages and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The fries were good as well.  For dessert we split a piece of Banana Crème Pie ($7), which was HUGE and served with banana slices and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce (I think?).  I had not had banana crème pie in ages, and it was yummy.  Our server said that the desserts are made on-site and the pie definitely tasted fresh.    It was a little more expensive than I typically pay for a lunch with a girlfriend, but the ingredients did indeed taste fresh, the wait staff was attentive and informative without being overbearing and everything that I had was delicious.  This is a great place for a special treat."}
{"text":"Take out can be kind of slow.  Have been several times & I enjoy the food.  Can't go wrong with the Ahi salad when it isn't sold out.  Crabcakes are okay."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, as we visit often.  I stopped by there tonight to find out they were in the middle of a renovation.... they will be re-opening on February 11th."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorites. The ambiance is wonderful. Service is always on point. What we love: -kale salad (just trust me) -smoked salmon appetizer (Oh my gah) -any fish (so fresh)  AND they have no corking fee! Super smart move. We're always more inclined to go somewhere where we can bring our own bottle and save $30. Then we can spend more on great food!   131 main, you remain a favorite and we can't wait for the Southpark location to open!!!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here! Love their cornbread appetizer-- I get it every time! Their prime rib is great and I literally inhaled the fries. Service is always phenomenal, totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"Joe D.  please contact me about service on 22 Feb.  I can't contact you other than via an update.  mitchkotula(at sign)yahoo(dot)com"}
{"text":"First time here, and a shout out to my Yelp buddy Nicole who said that we'd like this place. Well, she was RIGHT! Went here with wife and a friend at work, and we really enjoyed it here! I had the Ribeye which was marinated in a sweet soy sauce. That made the carmelization of my steak fantastic, and I love each and every bite! My wife had the prime rib special, and she said that she really liked it. Our friends had the Double Pork Chop (ridiculously large and tasty) and the special sea bass. Both really loved their dishes.  As an appetizer, I had their special artichoke/mushroom cream soup, which was lovely. Just a tad too thick, but the taste was very yummy. Our friends had the spinach dip, and that was good too. Just for grins and giggles, I ordered the deviled eggs. Now this is something that you just don't see on many menus, so we ordered the smaller portion, and boy was it ever good!  To top it off, we all split the banana creme pie, and that was really, really good.  Oh, and we got a $24 bottle of Cab from Paso Robles, CA, and we LOVED it! I'm a true wine lover, collector, and former wine judge, and this was a REALLY good bottle of wine, all for $24! GREAT deal.  All in all, this restaurant simply BLOWS AWAY Firebirds! Comparable ONLY in menu, but 131 Main is FAR, FAR superior!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My favorite night of the year annual Christmas dinner, with 3 college UNCC couples.  131 stuck us at a table for 4.  2 of the menu items weren't in stock (chicken and lamb), and I had to repeatedly ask for a drink.  My prime rib wasn't rare.  Overall really disappointed on a special night.  The bartenders were solid."}
{"text":"Started meal with a more than delicious bowl of mushroom, spinach, and artichoke soup which was absolutely tasty. My entree was the homemade meatloaf which was a meaty delight. Definitely recommend for good service and good food! Deviled eggs!!! 131 Main @ Blakeney"}
{"text":"Very ordinary. Service was good but the menu is nothing special and the food was just ok and overpriced for the quality served. Have had better meals but the last two have just not been worth it."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went for my anniversary and we had a great time, I came remember the name of my waitress but she was awesome, I had the pork chops with red mashed potatoes (if you're planning to get it make sure you share it) I'll be back here for sure!  Wait until they tell you about their catch of the day! It might be a fish from Alaska! And do yourself a favor, try it!"}
{"text":"Totally wonderful:  atmosphere, menu, options, service, bar.  Great grilled artichoke which you can also ask for as a side!  The aolie with them is to die for.  Have dined with a 4 year old and a 1 year old and it worked out fine.  Staff very supportive and the hub-bub of the place absorbed any noise and walking around with the children did not bother a soul.  Everything here is good.  Bar is above and to the side of the dining area, so can eat there or chat intimately with a friend.    Classy place and not outrageous price-wise, but ain't cheap at all.  But what you pay for is worth it.   Am surprised at some of the reviews, so recommend you try it yourself.  My son and his wife are foodies who have lived in NYC and Philly, so know the Zagot route and are impressed with 131.  There are two locations in Charlotte and I prefer the east blvd location, although both are consistently good."}
{"text":"Great bloody mary recipe!!!    I had the crabcakes and these are wonderful with the mustard sauce.     I highly recommend sunday brunch here.   Sit in the bar area.  The bartender is quite knowledgable and gives great service.     My only complaint.  The bloody marys should be in a pint glass.   But thats just my personal opinion."}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews and I thought it was high time to weigh-in (seeing that I've eaten here several times and never reviewed)!   Let's be straight with each other; I love this place!  Every time I've gone, the food and service is consistently good.   I also love the vibe. 131 is intimate and cozy, but also good for groups.  Great for birthdays and dates, which I've been to both at 131 Main!   131 Main offers great 'Americana' food.  Basically, your homestlye meals given classy makeover.  The portions are big (easily big enough to share).   In my opinion, the best dish at 131 Main is the Cast Iron Cornbread.  Its sweet, salty and just plain scrumptious! AND its massive-- easily able to be split at a table of four.  I also really enjoyed the meatloaf and salmon entrees.   If you are looking for somewhere to go on date night or even for a girls night out, I think 131 Main in Dilworth is a wise choice."}
{"text":"Had the Cobb Salad and cornbread.  The Cobb salad is very very good- excellent blend of chicken avocado bacon croutons..and sometimes in salads I just leave the croutons but these are so good and have a unique shape and flavor that screams home made.  The cornbread is thick and textured but tastes light...very decadent with the honey, it is dessert like.  My friend had a crab cake which she said was excellent."}
{"text":"Great dinner  4 fish dishes that all came out hot and perfectly prepared Salmon great Trout great Special great! Try the coleslaw"}
{"text":"Good food, bartender Daniel is amazing but hostess staff is not friendly or helpful at all, we were told 20-25 minutes wait time with a 2 year old, checked back at 30 minutes was told any second, several couples were seated who had walked in after us without reservation and we were still waiting, ordered to go from bar and left while waiting for food was called to table at 45 minutes while several other couples also were seated who had also walked way after us with no call ahead or reservation"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not that I was expecting a bad meal I just didn't think it would be this good.   Started with deviled eggs,  my girl thought they used too much  mustard but I liked them.  She had the grilled chicken sandwich and she loved it.   I had the prime rib sandwich with their coleslaw...which has an Asian influence and was very good.  The prime rib sandwich was hands down the best prime rib sandwich I've ever had.  Their dip and creamy horseradish sauce put it over the top.  A little messy to eat so maybe not best choice for a first date....my my fiancé did not seem to mind as she was too busy enjoying her food.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday during restaurant week. It was pretty yummy. I really liked their banana cream pie. The crust was nothing short of amazing. I'd go back again, for sure."}
{"text":"My family dined at 131 Main at the Blakeney Shopping Center for lunch on Sunday.  We shared the deviled egg appetizer - very tasty!  My wife and I both had some excellent Sea Bass (Grilled) with Braised Cabbage!!  My sons both had steaks and they were very happy with their meals as well. 131 Main has an excellent menu and excellent service as well. The wait staff is very attentive!   Parking is no problem and the restaurant itself is very clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. Very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Where to start . . . GREAT food, fun atmosphere, beautiful outside dining, great service, affordable specials.  The cornbread . . . OH MY GOODNESS!! This is a must!  Worth waiting in line for!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week with a group of friends on a Friday night. We were sat quickly and service was prompt. Both the restaurant week menu and regular menu we're available to order from.  I chose to order from the restaurant week menu. I started my meal with the house salad with their housemadd creamy garlic dressing. The salad was fresh and the dressing had good flavor. For my main course I chose the Maryland Crab Cakes with a side of fries. The crab cakes were decent but not a great, they were a little fishy tasting for my liking. The fries were delicious, shoestring fries with a great seasoning mix on them. For dessert, I had the brownie with ice cream; the brownie was almost like eating fudge, it was topped with an assortment of nuts. I found it to be very rich and could only eat a little, taking the rest home. I also tried a friend's peanut butter pie.....if you like peanut butter, this was wonderful.  Service was decent but not exceptional.       131 Main does allow you to bring your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee, this is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for one of my top 5 favorite bathrooms in Charlotte, this is it. Nicely tiled, 3 urinals with their own television, automatic sink, despite the door being a pull door to get out they had the trash right there so you could use the paper towel to open the door and throw it away. The other slight knock for me is that i don't really like paper towels piled up because you get the pile wet reaching for yours. It may have been a little dark but comforting and i found myself watching sports scores like i was sitting home on the couch in no rush to exit the bathroom. i did hear a rumor that there were no tvs for the ladies. Apparently, there are no Title IX issues for college sport watching.   Oh yeah, this place serves food as well (not to the restroom). Not just any food, i think they serve some of my favorite French fries i've had in ages. It might just be the habit-forming salt they use, but they were great. They are like shoestring fries with lots of annoying little pieces and i still loved them. i strayed from my norm and went with the club and was very satisfied. Although you could probably serve me any sandwich and if i have a side of honey mustard, it will be good to me (just ask Quiznos). The cornbread really is like a dessert. Seemed like a hearty portion that comes out in a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza like dish. Add honey and you're golden. Good stuff.    We were here for lunch and sat on the patio. Make sure you get your workout in before you go otherwise you'll just be hating on every runner that passes by as you shovel the french fries down your throat."}
{"text":"Glad I did not have to think about running into Al here (second reason for giving this place another look)!  I had eaten the Ribs before when they first opened and remember them begin tasty and better than most other places.  Since then I have eaten a lot of Ribs, I'm back here to eat them a YES they are Very Good!  The Gazpacho is chunkier than most versions, in my estimation it is highly Americanized, still Yummy Yum I would eat this on a boat or with a goat and it is a RED (not green) Gazpacho!  Not a hint of olive oil, nor fennel, nor vinegar (every culture has a different take on it (so I heard). Garnished with a Lime Infused (I guess) Sour Cream.  It gets 5 yelp stars!  The Fries are Impressive and make it on my \"Lonely Fries\" list because they are that good!  Almost as good as \"Brick Tops\"  Close to five yelp stars!  The Bar!  Bars are usually not where I want to eat, nor drink, though I will if no other seats are available and I LOVE Crowds!  Usually Bars, as \"furniture\" have little appeal unless they are really cool!  131 Main Blakeney has a Bar that reminds me of that  _____     _______, Jack Nicholson \"Bar\" scene in \"The Shinning\", so I think that is pretty cool, 5 yelp stars for the Bar!  Prime Rib ordered and prepared VERY RARE, completely perfect!  Three way tie with \"Epic Chop House\" and \"Brick Tops\"... 5 yelp stars!  Babyback Pork Ribs (maybe babyback ribs are always Pork, I'm guessing)... Lean and flavorful!  A VERY close Tie with \"Brick Tops\"!  5 yelp stars!  BBQ Sauce...This is a good one, better than most, probably in my top picks for a BBQ sauce of this kind.  Close to five stars!  The Cornbread is an appetizer served in a Cast Iron Skillet (see my photos).  This is a good Cornbread, soft non-grainy texture with Jalapenos, Butter on Top and Broiled until it is almost burned!  This is a preparation I have never seen before.  The flavor was good enough for 3.88 yelp stars which means I'm glad I checked it out though would not order it again!   I told my server that I would compare the Burger here to a \"Cow Fish\" Burger, ooops!  Cow Fish wins by almost two stars... 131 Main 3.2 Stars for the Burger!  P&G Slaw... Hated it... Not really and even after we found out it was a Mayonnaise Based Slaw I forgot to tell them to omit it from my order, so I got, I ate it and though I do not like Mayonnaise it was a good Slaw for a Mayonnaise based Slaw!  The place looks really great (beats \"Brick Tops\" for Looks) they have a cool patio and the Service beats almost everyone!  All staff is very personable and one of the Managers made a comment about my photo of the Very Rare Prime Rib making people jealous... Maybe if they like VERY Rare Beef!  You may not want to view this photo..."}
{"text":"I've been to 131 Main many times and it's a very solid restaurant. Everything on the menu is consistently good and reasonably priced, service is amazing, staff is super friendly, and they have a great wine selection. My favorites are the chicken tortilla soup, gazpacho, ahi tuna salad, and the double cut pork chop. The only small downside, from my experience, is the menu doesn't change very often (even the specials). So if you're a regular, don't expect a lot of variation.  Food Rating: 4.5/5 Service Rating: 5/5 Ambiance Rating: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"If you have a group larger than 4 don't bother coming. They don't take reservations even though when called earlier in the week we were told that they do. Waited for 40 mins and got a text saying that the table was ready, when we walked up to the hostess stand we were told that no one knows who sent the text and that there was in fact no table ready."}
{"text":"The salmon was ON POINT. Sub the rice with the kale salad and you'll feel so much better about yourself!  If you go dessert, the strawberry shortcake is unlike any I've had at a restaurant before. The cake is crusted on the outside, creating a sort of moist scone that when couple with the ice cream and strawberries is INCREDIBLE. Split it for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food. Started with double dip, the (special) artichoke and mushroom soup, then the sirloin with soy marinade and finished with the brownie."}
{"text":"Excellent! Absolute 5 star worthy. Food quality & quantity and service.    Best restaurant I've found since moving to the area a year ago."}
{"text":"131 Main is our \"EVERY OCCASION' go to restaurant! Birthday, Anniversary, Federal Holiday- name it!   It was like the copy cat of HOUSTON's in NY- only they do not have the best ribs but the closets tasting ribs to HOUSTON!   I have tried several items on the menu. From the Deviled Eggs (appetizer), Maryland Style Crab Cakes, Flounder, Salmon and Trout. And I kid you not- they're all perfect!  Flavor, taste, texture, and even the plating! - I eat like there is no tomorrow in this joint! I don't ever think about the weight I might gained the next day just because it was pretty awesome! love love it!   oh.. and try the Banana Creme for dessert! it'll blow your mind off from the over all sweetness!"}
{"text":"The have great Brunch here.. Crab Cake with white cheddar grits are amazing.. I always love the rainbow trout with red cabbage"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at 131 Main and the Reuben sandwich was the best I've had in Charlotte in the 14 years I've lived here (and that's saying something, as I'm from New York City where we can find lots of places serving great Reubens). This is a really nice place for lunch. And not to be forgotten... the key lime pie. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"I'm delayed in entering this review, but in September we had an awesome evening with the family at 131 Main.  Our server was Tara Franklin and she was extremely knowledgable about the overall menu and assisting us with ideas for the kids and even ourselves.  Whenever I have a hard time choosing between 2 or 3 entrees, I love getting server input since they typically know the dishes pretty well and Tara did not steer me wrong.  The food was phenomenal.  I had a seafood special that melted in my mouth. When my son needed a plain piece of bread for his hot dog, instead of focaccia that it is served on, she quickly requested some toasted bread from the kitchen.  It was delivered and my son shared the bread with his sister that was eating a pulled pork dish.  She used the toast to turn her dish into mini sliders.  Tara laughed at her creativity and called her a \"future chef\", which is my daughter's dream.  Upon hearing this, Tara got her a tour of the kitchen - which my 10 yr old daughter just loved.  We had been to 131 Main numerous times before, and always had a great experience, but this one was just over the top awesome and we had such an incredible night. It's great to have a really nice local restaurant that is family friendly too.  We will return - often."}
{"text":"We recently enjoyed celebrating our anniversary at 131 Main. We considered Good Food on Montford or the Cellar at Duckworth's Downtown, but knew 131 Main wouldn't let us down. So satisfied with our service. I would say ask for Chris, but the service is consistently high with any of their well trained wait staff. We were off to a good start when hot towels came out after the appetizer. I personally enjoy being able to customize a dish, and it come out as expected. For example, I asked that the steak in the Thai Steak salad be replaced with Ahi Tuna, and that a side of kale be mixed in. Our order was perfect, as expected after years of patronage. Thank you for another perfect evening 131 Main."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night about 8 pm, surprisingly a short wait for our table. Started with cocktails. My wife loved the Pearfection.  Simple dinner: roast beef sandwich.   Theirs is the best around always rare and tender. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs with a delicious creamy slaw. All food was prepared well. Menu is rather short, but menu items are done well."}
{"text":"I would love to upgrade my review and may soon. I've eaten here a dozen times and have never had stellar food. I'm a big appetizer fan but 131 Main obviously is not. They have 6. One is deviled eggs (is it Thanksgiving dinner at my Aunt's house??). Then there's cornbread (no, I want an appetizer not something I get for free at the local diner...). Smoked salmon and seared tuna?? Hmmmm, no really where are the real appetizers?! They do have a mean cheese dip (you can keep the green snot....guoc!) but really that's pitiful! I am still looking for that great entree...had a filet here once and it was decent but not worth $30. The smashed reds were terrible. Zero flavor! Like, add some milk and butter possibly some salt and pepper....anything??? Incredible ambience (view) but could not be louder- bad acoustics... I can't hang my hat on mean cheese dip...please get better 131 Main Lastly....they have a roast beef sandwich some people rave about....I would rave about it as well if it included CHEESE! Seriously, what roast beef sandwich that you dip in \"Ju\" has no cheese??? It's not American and quite frankly embarrassing...."}
{"text":"I really want to like this 131, yet at the same time why should I care? The last couple of times I've been my experience has been subpar. Plus, the interior just has an odd feel...maybe it's me. The location is great, but the setup seems odd and the place has never been busy when I've gone. Anyway...  When this place is on, it's pretty damn solid. I recommend sitting outside or at the cocktail tables in the bar. I'm no southern boy and, therefore, not a cornbread fan, but this place does something unreal with it. I order it every time. Drizzle the honey on it and....mmmmm. Try the awesome roast beef sandwich (I never recommend roti de beouf, but here I make an exception). The steak salad and the ahi tuna salad are both on-point; I'm a sucker for noodles, mango, avocado...etc. These are entree size portions, not your run-of-the-mill wimpy salad with a slab o' meat on it.  As I mentioned earlier, however, I just haven't been impressed the last couple visits. A subpar veggie burger and a stale roll on my roast beef sandwich...seriously hard as a rock. Service was slow and didn't seem genuine, which doesn't make sense when the place is nearly empty. I don't know why this location struggles so. Will someone enlighten me? It never looks busy when I walk by either.  All that said, I recommend the Cornelius or Ballantyne locations over this one, which is too bad considering this one definitely has the best location."}
{"text":"131 is always a solid choice. Almost everything on the menu is very good.  For a starter, I highly recommend the grilled artichoke. It is light, smokey and tender.  The black skillet cornbread is another great choice. It is served warm with butter and a honey bear.   The only thing I can't recommend is the ribeye. I have tried it several times and I am always disappointed.  It is a thin cut and not great quality. 131 is a great restaurant, but it is no steakhouse. If you are craving beef, go with the prime rib. You will not be disappointed.   All the seafood dishes are outstanding. The grilled fish is always fresh and cooked to perfection. My all time favorite is the shrimp and grits.  There is no better shrimp and grits on the planet!!!!  For dessert, the banana pie is the bomb. No matter how full you are....make room for this pie."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for a business meeting. Started off with the Tuna and Salmon apps. both highly recommended. Dinner was not accompanied by salad (disappointment..)  had the t-bone non-marinated. Super Fatty!  Flavor was ok but not worth the price. Had much better. Service so so. Nothing to rave about overall.   Would I come back ..... Nope. Not worth the $$."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, the raw fish incident had to of been a fluke because it never happened again. Their food is very consistent and everything on the menu that I have tried taste amazing. Definitely one of my favorite spots! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The smoked salmon was very good.  I ordered the scallops and my son had the filet.  The scallops had average flavor but it was not warm in the center.  Not sure if there seafood is fresh or frozen??? Slightly under cooked.  Service was good but for the price I expected better food.  My son's steak was just ok and also under cooked for med rare.  For $36 I expect the filet to be excellent.  I like it more rare then medium but this was even rare for me."}
{"text":"Went there on a very busy Saturday night.  Nicely decorated - kind of a modern arts and crafts style. Lots of space for waiting, especially cool was the outdoor fireplace on the patio where you could bring a drink and wait for your table. Long wait (over an hour) on a Saturday night.  This is definitely a date restaurant at night - dark, romantic, cozy booths and strong drinks. Menu is New American, lots of proteins with veggie sides. We started with a queso/guac combo dip - it was unusual in that the queso was more of a pimento dip with shredded cheese but very tasty. Our entree's were both very good, double-stuffed porkchop and the crab cake salad. Generous portions, perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients.  Service was very good, helpful and playful waiter who paced the meal well and understood we didn't want to be rushed.   A good place that deserves repeat business, especially in this age of chains!"}
{"text":"Tara is the best server I have ever had. She was accommodating, engaging and knowledgeable. She offered great wine and food reccomendations and was the perfect mix of charming and professional.  Food was great, but the service was EXCELLENT.  Thanks, Tara!"}
{"text":"I have mostly been to 131 Main for lunch or during off hours while shopping on a Saturday afternoon.  While pricey the food has always been very good.  My experience this past Friday night has led me to write a review.  I recognize the faster tables are turned over the more money the establishment makes but I should not be rushed when me and my guest are spending about  $150 for a meal and drinks.   In no way did we feel welcome to linger over the meal.  We didn't have our entree for 5 minutes before being asked whether we wanted dessert.  The checking in by the wait staff made it very clear they wanted us too wrap up our meal including no offers for a new drink.  Again the food is great but the rush job was incredibly frustrating. Unless I go off hours where I can comfortably sit in the bar area I will go elsewhere for a nice meal."}
{"text":"131 Main is one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants! The service and food are impeccable. I have never had a bad experience at the restaurant and feel like the staff truly make the evening enjoyable."}
{"text":"I tried 131 Main a few weeks ago and had mixed emotions about it. For starters we tried the corn bread. It was good....I am scared to imagine the fat and calorie content of this dessert-like appetizer, but nevertheless it was good.  Very rich, but good. For dinner I ordered chicken with a rice dish instead of the potatoes. The chicken was good but I found it to be incredibly salty. I like well seasoned food, but this was extraordinarily salty to me. The rice was delicious. I believe it had cilantro in it.  It was very tasty.  The chicken portion was too much for me to finish. I'd rather have been offered a smaller piece of chicken and a salad or green vegetable to complete my meal instead of a huge piece of chicken with just one side. I took the rest of the chicken home but decided it was too salty to eat again and so I threw it away. I MIGHT try this place again in the future...but only if I am in the mood for just a good meal at a steep price."}
{"text":"I went about a week ago for dinner with out-of-town family. We ordered the Artichoke with dip, Scallops as appetizer and entree, and I have the fried Flounder with mashed potatoes. Everything was GOOD. A solid good.  Mind you the flavors aren't gonna blow you out the water, but the simple fact that you can taste the freshness and maybe even the great training of the chefs in it is well worth it. The best dish of the evening had to be the Scallops with a firm, smooth polenta. Keep in mind that the scallops go quickly, so don't be surprised if you need to order additional."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant will catch you off guard, I was not expecting such a great layout when I walked in.  The bar was hopping and business was very steady even on a weeknight.  The food was fabulous!  I had the meatloaf and it was definitely something to die for.  If you have never had cucumber salad, you have to try it at 131 Main!  Service was excellent, the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and the daily specials.  The only thing I don't like about the place is that it is really hard to have a conversation.  The layout seems to have a hole in the air sucking out your voice, I felt as though I had to repeat myself over and over just to make a conversation.  Overall my satisfaction with 131 Main is over-the-top.  131 Main would get a 5-star rating if I would have been able to carry on a conversation without being drowned out by the noise.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at 131 Main last night and I found it, on the whole, and considering the price, no more than fair.   The service was quick and efficient. And this, actually, was a problem. It was *too* quick and efficient.   I know what you're thinking but bear with me - we placed a drink order. A beer and cocktail and they were both at our table so quickly we wondered if the cocktail was pre-made. Sounds good, right? But everything arrived so quickly after we ordered it. we still had a table full of appetizers and salads when our main courses came out. The pace was way off, and the whole dinner felt rushed. Not, mind you, that any member of the wait  staff made us feel that they were rushing us. I'm not sure if it was because we arrived at 9pm or what but we had stuff piling up in front of us faster than we could eat it.   Now. \"the stuff\".   Not a broad beer selection here on tap. Old Meck Copper was the only micro-brewery beer on tap. The Cocktail, one Pama'Tini was sweet, but mediocre. It tasted pretty much like any drink at a daiquiri bar like a Fat Tuesdays or a Wet Willie's - but without the ice or freeze factor.   For starters we got Roasted Artichokes, and on a whim, deviled eggs.   The roasted artichokes were fantastic. Served 3 to an order, slightly blackened and covered in oil and served with a remoulade.  They were just fantastic once I was given a quick lesson in how to eat them by my wife and another by our server- Don't bother chewing the leaves. Bite them and pull them from your mouth, scraping out the meaty insides. Of course the artichoke heart was perfect and needed no such oral gymnastics to enjoy.   The deviled eggs were just deviled eggs. Acceptable, but the homemade ones someone always makes brings to any corporate pot-luck or family get-together are better.   After discussing the meal options with our waiter I ordered the Marinated Ribeye, which came up because I mentioned I loved the artichoke's grilled flavor. And my wife ordered the Roasted Chicken. Both served with smashed red potatoes but I opted instead for a side of hand-cut shoestring fries and at the last second added a Cucumber Salad because the waiter's description sounded so good.   The Cumber Salad. Cucumbers, onion, and 1 tiny bite-sized tomato (halved) with a vinegar dressing. I thought it was very tasty indeed.   The steak was pretty much a failure. Marinated in a sweet soy sauce as the waiter and menu said- but I detected none of the grilled flavor of the artichokes that I had craved. I guess next time I'll get something like their grilled trout or salmon. This would have been ok, really, had the steak actually been good.   It was cooked medium-rare as I had ordered, but the marinade was so salty & sweet that to be honest it almost tasted like glazed ham and not beef. Go to any chain steakhouse and have the \"Hawaiian Ribeye\" or whatever their similar offering is and it will be better than this steak was.   So, I didn't like it, that's fine, I ordered it. That's ok. Thank goodness I still had a table full of deviled eggs, cucumber salad, and grilled artichokes to eat. Not to mention the side of fries I got and sampling my wife's choices.   Oh yeah. The fries...   They were great. No joke, some of the best fries I've ever had- maybe a  touch over-salted but awfully yummy.   The Roasted Chicken was very tasty and went well with the smashed red potatoes. All dark meat, great demi-glace, yummy also.   We really wanted to try the Banana Creme Pie for dessert.  But unfortunately - it has peanuts in the crust and I am allergic. Good thing we asked, as this was a surprise.   They had 5 desserts available and 3 contained peanuts. My only options were the Key Lime Pie which we were told had almonds in the crust. I'm not allergic to almonds but I didn't want Key Lime. I also didn't want strawberry shortcake. So I was out of luck as far as dessert went. Not really their fault on this one.   So. To recap:  Great artichokes Great fries Good chicken Good cucumber salad Average deviled eggs Bad Steak  For the price I thought it wasn't quite good enough. But I could certainly see myself coming back and trying something else or just hanging out around the huge fire-pit on the patio and having a few drinks. They did have an awesome patio."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. I recently went for lunch with my mom, and she ordered a salad and me the roast beef sandwich.  Her salad had a chicken tendon or ligament in it. It was disgusting. When we told the waitress, she was adamant that it was normal. The manager then came out and apologized, but they didn't take it off of the bill. Seriously? That's not how you get me to come back.  My roast beef sandwich was very average--not hot, bread not crispy, just average. I could make a similar sandwich at my house for half the price.   This place has really gone down in my books. I probably won't be back. Oh well."}
{"text":"I am very impressed! After our last visit, I received an email from the owner and a phone call from the General Manager about our visit due to my recent review here on Yelp.  They have invited us back in for another chance, at their cost, and are very interested in keeping their restaurant above reproach.  I have never had a restaurant contact me about a review before and this shows me that they are on the ball and want their customers to have an impeccable experience.  I look forward to returning and sharing good news.  I highly recommend checking out this restaurant. They obviously care a great deal about their customers and it shows. :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed 131 Main during Charlotte Restaurant Week!!! The food was delicious & accompanied by excellent customer service. I will definitely return soon!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. It was a great choice. The look and feel of the place is really nice, and the food was amazing. We had the cornbread appetizer, which is a completely different take on a southern classic. Very tasty. For the main course, we had the pork chop and smashed red potatoes. I didn't realize that pork chops came in that size (they were the largest I'd ever seen). They were well spiced, juicy, and delicious."}
{"text":"It was our wedding anniversary and we had a couple of coupon deals. The first was a for a free appetizer, no purchase necessary, at 131 Main. We'd never been before and everyone raved about their crab cakes. Rightfully so! $50 later we walked out thrilled with our first stop of the evening. The service couldn't have been any more perfect. By the end of the evening we were asking for the dates & times our waiter (Brandon) would be working so we could specifically ask for him. The appetizers, the drinks and the conversations with our waiter, and the manager, were delightful. We were sad we had to leave, but it made for a great start to celebrate our 26th anniversary!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak in town is the Big Island Ribeye.  Smoked Salmon app is a great value. Family favorite in Blakeney area"}
{"text":"We've been going to this 131 main for about 5+ years now for all life events for my family. I haven't been in a while and we had family visiting from out of town and wanted to take them to our favorite place. I called to make a reservation, the hostess was short and uncompromising. They will take reservations for up to four people but six is out of the question. This is a completely backwards policy. It makes more sense to take larger reservations and not small ones so you can anticipate the crowd. She told me I could just show up maybe at 8 (we wanted a 7pm reservation) and see what happens. Really great experience guys...one star for customer service and another one for the good food (albeit the pricing on the 'awesome roast beef sandwich' increased by 5 dollars when they changed the name to 'prime rib sandwich' without doing anything to the recipe)"}
{"text":"Parking is a chore. We arrived before the valet came out so we had to park in a neighborhood a few blocks away (should have read a recent Yelp-er who suggested just parking in the Starbucks lot).  Service was attentive, almost overly so. This place employs the tag team waitstaff approach where you get a revolving door of servers, waiters, busboys, etc. You didn't know who was coming next. Personally, I like the one water to a table system. Anyway, Brittany, who was \"taking care of us tonight\" (God, I hate that expression) must've gotten fired from her last job as a used car salesman, because she tried to sell and upsell on every visit to our table. Enough! If I want another beer, I'll ask. If I want the special, I'll tell you. Dessert?  My choice. Entirely too pushy.   The food itself was just OK. I wish I knew I was paying an extra $9 for a single, so-so crabcake. When Brittany described it originally it sounded like it came with the special of one of my fellow patrons. I had the rib eye which was really fatty and not cooked enough (Tip: choose the cheaper by $2 non-marinated version. The soy and something marinade made it too sweet). Another friend's pork chop looked good. On all three plates came a passable mashed potato something, but no other vegetable.   At $60 (with tip) per head for salad, entree and two drinks each, 131 Main was certainly not worth the trip."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely lovely dining experience here during restaurant week. First off, the outside of this restaurant is gorgeous, and the patio/fire pit looks amazing! Our reservation was for 7:30 and it was already packed. The bar area was insane. We were quickly seated and greeted by a great, animated waiter who gave us a great run down of the menu and drinks. I ordered a cocktail with deep Eddy's and firefly and hubby got a beer. My cocktail was excellent. For appetizers we ordered deviled eggs and guac. The portion sizes for this whole restaurant week meal were HUGE. Both appetizers were delicious, and I did a terrible job pacing myself. For entrees I ordered the salmon and husband got the ribs. The ribs were amazing! The salmon I ordered was also delectable, with a great mustard sauce and rice salad on the side. I was not able to finish much of it but hubby killed the ribs. For dessert we ordered the brownie with ice cream and the peanut butter pie. Both were amazing! We ate the ice cream brownie at the restaurant and took the peanut butter pie to go, it was great the next day! I love the ambiance in there and the waiter and waitress team were perfect. The manager even came by and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit, we will definitely be back soon! After this amazing meal, we passed out on the floor at 9:30. A Friday night to remember!"}
{"text":"Great homemade soup  Great sandwich Daniel the bartender is also very good And even the water in the men's room is warm with  one of the self starting units usually the water is cold Only note the men's room could be a little brighter All in all worth going to!!!"}
{"text":"Well I ate here twice and enjoyed both times I came here. I love there double dip and corn bread.  Also always get the cajan pasta which is a joy.  I wish they have more entrees to offer but its just a limited selection.  The crab cakes are the worst though had to send them back.  As a true Marylander I know what crab cakes should taste like and they were off by far."}
{"text":"Have visited both the Blakeney and Huntersville locations, and they are comparable. The biggest difference in the sound level, which is more muted in Huntersville. The restaurant designer subscribes to the theory that more ambient noise creates a sense of excitement, but I think they confuse \"excitement\" with \"anxiety\" and \"exhaustion\", as a simple conversation can become a struggle.  As for the food, yeah, it's pretty good. The roast beef sandwich has been enjoyed on more than one occasion. The service has been all over the map, but never so bad that we vowed never to return.  Wine list is pretty good, and the bars in both locations are hopping. Count on spending some time there, even if you have a reservation, and don't even bother trying to go on a peak time without a reservation.   [Tip: Smartphone users, download Open Table and use it in a situation like this. You can browse local restaurants to find one with capacity for you without calling each of them and being placed on hold until the hostess can find the time to take the call.]"}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch, and thought the venue is well suited for business functions/meals.  I ordered the cut of salmon with seasonal vegetables. Both had just the right amount of salt and pepper an the salmon was cooked perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  Everyone else loved their dishes as well, especially the awesome roast beef sandwich.   The menu had so many great options that it was hard to choose, but I do have to say it isn't a good place to go for picky eaters."}
{"text":"My first question...What happened to the standards of 131 Main?  This was our first visit back since the reopening.  Stopped in January 26, 2013 and the place was packed.  Great sign that everyone is happy the restaurant is back!  My wife and I grabbed a seat at the bar because we did not have a reservation this night.  Bartender was amazing, quickly noticed us and came by to take our drink order. She then gave us menus and told us we could eat at the bar.  Alright, time to order...Deviled Eggs to start, the Roast Beef sandwich(which had always been amazing), a Veggie burger, and two iced teas.  Deviled eggs came first and the filling was a bit sweet for my wife but I quickly finished them off.  Then the entrees...Veggie burger looked like a raw meat patty due to the beets.  With the low lighting in the restaurant, I have to say...even I was a bit disgusted by the look of this thing.  Maybe just a preference but worth mentioning.  Bartender quickly told us that Vegetarians like to feel like they are eating real meat.  I was a bit puzzled by this response but neither one of us being a Vegetarian, just nodded our heads.  The bun of this beet patty was as hard as a rock to the point of being able to pick up the entire burger simply by inserting a fork in the lower bun and lifting up.  Side of broccoli flavors were ok but cold and only 4 florets.  Now on to the Roast Beef sandwich I had been waiting for...I believe its the \"Awesome\" Roast Beef sandwich.  It used to be.  One bite and the entire sandwich was cold.  Bread was cold and soggy enough to hold my fingerprint and just fell apart.  Portion of Roast Beef has definitely been decreased.  I received the same cold 4 broccoli florets.  When I asked the server if the entire sandwich was supposed to be cold, I was told yes.  \"It is rare roast beef.\"  Again, puzzled by the response so I just left the sandwich and cut my losses.  My wife did let the bartender know about the quality of the vegetarian burger and she promptly removed it from the bill.  I was just looking to get out of there as fast as possible and pick up something else on the way home.  It's a shame because I used to love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding fire pit grilled tenderloin steak. Everything is brought in fresh daily and made daily including the fresh juices for their margaritas. Also one of the best wine lists for the value. Finish your dinner with their in-house made-from-scratch key lime pie. Make it easy on yourself and use their valet service on corner of East Blvd and Scott Blvd."}
{"text":"The food here was great! The ambiance also was phenomenal. A restaurant like this would easily command super high prices in a New York or a LA. The prices here were quite reasonable I found.  I had the prime rib and it was perfect. My dinner companion had the cra cake and it was not to their liking. My advice to anyone would be to NEVER have crab cakes outside of Maryland. Seriously, NEVER.  One note is beware of any thing not on the menu, the cost can be a bit more than the range on the menu. For example, the hostess told us the specials and one was a good $20 higher than what was on the menu! Having said that, being from NY, I know for a fact our bill would have been twice as high even with what we had.  Take the ride and stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely serves some of the best food I've ever had!  Everything we ate was amazing... the corn bread is delicious and the pork chop my boyfriend got was HUGE!  I got shrimp and grits.  I don't always like grits, but these were so tasty!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there to have dinner and there was a long wait so we sat at the bar for dinner. It was packed, but we got a seat pretty quickly as a couple was finishing up their dinner. The drink selection was good, we both enjoyed the martinis. I ordered the filet special which I enjoyed. However, my husband tried the fish special  which came out partially raw. He sent it back and it was still raw. At that point he ate what he could but otherwise was disappointed with his selection. We'd try it again since we know people who enjoy going on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Just moved down to NC. This was a stop for lunch. Wonderful service and friendly staff. The food was delicious. I had the ahi tuna salad. Very tasty delicately flavored. My son had the Cobb salad which was equally delicious but too much to finish for a lunch time. Would highly recommend this restaurant I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times before and always pleased. Today I had Mother's Day lunch with another couple. Staff were very attentive and friendly. We had reserved a table so we did not have to wait. The restaurant was packed and somewhat noisy.  The menu, special for Mother's Day, featured their most popular and requested cuisine choices. Everything fresh and nothing frozen.  Some fish we were told flown in over night.  Our orders consisted of rainbow trout with kale salad, I substituted a Caesar  salad instead with a extra surcharge. House salad or Caesar salad $6 extra as a side salad with an entree. Also ordered were rib eye steak with homemade mashed  red potatoes, seared scallops with cheesy grits, wild mushroom artichoke soup, desserts of strawberry short cake and  a signature dessert of banana cream pie.  Everything was delicious, plated attractively, good portions, came out hot and moderately priced. Soup was creamy and tasty, steak cooked to order,  trout tender, scallops just slightly peppery for one of the diners, grits and potatoes yummy. The salads great with plenty of  delicious dressing. The desserts large enough for two people to share. Ice cream over cake over strawberries and a pile of whipped cream with chocolate and caramel drizzles,  over the pie, oh yum! Coffee and sweet tea very good.  Our waitress was very attentive which made for a pleasant dining experience. All in all, a great meal. We will be back again"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing veggie burger and a local beer selection. Clean atmosphere and extensive wine selection"}
{"text":"Went last night. Friendly servers, food is fair. For the price  there are better restaurants. Everything over seasoned and  not even a piece of bread while waiting."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Great food, great service, great atmosphere!!!  You have to order the cornbread - melts in your mouth.   Prices are a little high but quality is also high."}
{"text":"This is the second 131 main in the area - the original being in Cornelius.  I love this restaurant.  It is modern, upscale and has rgeat food and drinks.  Every time I have gone the service has been right on.  I have a friend that lives next door so we have met here for drinks/dinner several times and loved every moment of it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy 131 Main.  We don't go there often but it is always a good option.  Been mostly going for lunch and have one option that we always get.  The Prime Rib sandwich is that one \"go to\" option.     I will warn you that it is expensive but again it is heavenly.   The meat always has great flavor the au jus that it comes with puts it over the top.  I just ate this a few hours ago and my mouth is watering while writing the review.     If you have the option don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Beautiful menu, had a hard time deciding! Went with the grilled salmon, did not dissapoint. Also recommend the Ahi Tuna appetizer. Great place to take parents visiting from out of town. We were there for about 3 hours and didn't feel rushed or hurried by staff."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly unimpressed with my dining experience here on a recent Saturday night. Luckily (or unluckily), getting a reservation for two on short notice was easy peasy, but then mediocrity ensued.   Our waitress was very busy not attending to us. We saw her maybe every 20 minutes, and we were in and out in about 45 minutes - you do the math. I could see the place was pretty packed with some tables of larger parties, but considering the price tag of our meal, I was expecting a bit more in terms of service and experience.  Next, the food. I respect that 131 Main seems to focus their menu on seasonal produce, and makes an effort to come up with creative spins on traditional American dishes. But what was actually served was not very exciting. My date got meatloaf and I had the crab cake salad. His meatloaf tasted like it came from a cafeteria. My salad was fresh, and the lump crab was generous, but the mustard sauce on the side was overpowering and heavily mayonaissed. Didn't quite go with the rest of my light and delicate plate.  I liked the dim, romantic atmosphere here, but probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Can always count on 131 Main to provide an outstanding dining experience.  They are consistent.   At times, it's a bit noisy and tough to converse, but today that was not the case.  I had the chopped salad that had everything in it but the kitchen sink. The greens were very finely chopped and mixed in with quinoa.   Exquisite.  Tasty food and great ambiance.  Charlotteans are very lucky to have this restaurant as a dining option."}
{"text":"This was our third visit and every time we go, we have a better experience.  From the bartender to wait staff - everyone is considerate, kind, and it seems their goal is to make your evening a positive experience.  The management must be very good because the employees seem to be happy and they work towards the same goal.  And I haven't even mentioned the food - it is very, very good.  The menu has an excellent range of options.  The quality and care in preparation never disappoints - no matter what I order off the menu.  I'm looking forward to bringing my son here for the Big Island Ribeye!  My husband always gets the Ahi Tuna Salad and he loves it.  I've had the Thai Steak Salad, the Crab Cakes, and this time the Big Island Ribeye.  All of them are great and I'm looking forward to trying the Salmon with Wild Rice Salad next time.  Try this place - you will love it."}
{"text":"An absolutely, uniformly, fantastic dinning experience. Service is always ideal. Lunch, dinner, brunch on Sunday this is always a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"I love this location. Bar tenders are friendly, attentive and make great drinks. The outside eating area and fire pit outside is a plus. The menu is minimalist but when it's well done it doesn't have to be extensive."}
{"text":"My fave...the most delicious and consistent food. Great service and staff...great bar feel with patio and a go-to for a nice dinner in the dining room."}
{"text":"I love 131 it is my go to restaurant every location is great food and service. The marinated ribeye is the best thing I've ever eaten. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"OK, I was a little reluctant as it was recommended by my hotel and they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer. That gave me pause, but I went anyways. 131 Main smelled awesome walking up with that great wood-grill aroma. I started with a cocktail and a wedge salad (top-notch).   I was a little concerned because I wanted a filet after smelling that great beef smell walking in, but there was none on the menu. Fortunately, the server gave me the good news: twin filet medallions wrapped in bacon with cabernet demi-glace and blue cheese with mashed potatoes. Do not tell my doctor, but that's what I ordered. It was very, very good.   Did not order dessert, but I imagine that they were good. I would definitely return. Hopefully the weather will be a little bit nicer because they have a great looking outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I went during the Taste of Charlotte! The staff is amazing and the food is fabulous. They were very accommodating to our needs. I had the main salad, chips and cheese dip, prime rib and banana cream pie.  Seriously and truly very very good food! I enjoyed the cheese dip, which is a clump of cheese and peppers--odd looking but super delicious. The prime rib was also very tender and flavorable. I'm in out of towner and after I finished by doggie bags and wanted more.."}
{"text":"Yikes! As i was getting a to go order at the bar I witnessed a server telling  the bartender the patron \"didn't like the wine\". Meaning to me, she tasted it. I watched the server pour the glass back onto the wine bottle to serve to other patrons. Gross and germs. I asked to talk to a manager and was refused. I don't think I'll be going there anymore. I don't drink wine, but that's a horrible practice."}
{"text":"Always a great restaurant but they out did themselves on this NYE. Great menu for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Once again, Perfect and delicious!! Stopped by after a birthday party at the Common Market.  Ordered three appetizers, Cornbread, Grilled Artichokes, and Smoked Salmon. The Service was fast and spot on - Our Waitress Angelina was outstanding. It never ceases to amaze me that what ever time you come it is perfect. Our drinks were refilled without even asking and it was candle lit and cool. I cannot say enough about this place --Quality is their name!!"}
{"text":"Having visit the other location before I stopped in here recently expecting nothing but similar goodness!  Can't say that happened, but all in all it was fine.   Not really sure how to describe the service other than to say it was just off.  Took entirely too long to get a beer and I will add that there was one beer put on the houses tab for the trouble I had.  I like it when an establishment knows how to correct issues.  Offer FREE stuff.  That's it.    The meal was great, I had the Mahi dish and it was uber buttery and oh so good.  The girlfriend had some sort of Thai salad and it was fantastic and gave me meal envy for sure.  This is a nice romantic spot to take a date and the outdoor area for dining sports a cool fireplace if that strikes your fancy as well."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went to 131 Main last night and were very disappointed in both the food and service. I ordered a caesar salad for an appetizer which was less than average. I ordered the 8 oz. prime rib for dinner, which was cooked well but not a good cut of meat. It did not have a lot of flavor and the texture was off. My side of horseradish had a hair in it when it arrived at the table. The waitress didn't come over for nearly 10 minutes after our entrees came out to check on us. When she finally did I told her about the sauce and she sent a different waiter back to give me a new one. She should have at the very least brought it out herself and apologized. She probably should have offered my glass of wine on the house.. In general the waitress was not very quick in attending to us and there were not many other diners in the restaurant yet as we had a 6pm dinner on a Monday night. Needless to say I will not be visiting 131 main any time soon."}
{"text":"Top notch service and fresh local sourced food, nice atmosphere that is well thought out. Had two business meetings here and one date with my wife, each 5 stars. Don't bring the kids and complain this is not a restaurant you order chicken strips at and certainly no chicken nuggets!"}
{"text":"We went here for Restaurant Week, family of 5. They have so many TV commercials that the restaurant name stuck in my head. This was my first time at this restaurant and actually eating around the East Blvd. locals.  They have free parking, which was nice compared to some Uptown locations only minutes away. We went immediately after church, around 1pm, and the restaurant wasn't close to being crowded, at all.   Regarding the food, they had a variety of Restaurant Week choices. Since we had 3 adults eating, we ordered a variety.  The Mushroom / Artichoke Soup was tasty with the first bite, but by the end, it tasted very bland (almost like a gravy instead of a soup). They have a dipping cheese combo which included a really yummy guacamole.  Entrees included Salmon and Ribeye.  Both were okay. Not the best I've had, but not the worst either.  Dessert included Strawberry Shortcake, Brownie A La Mode, and Key Lime Pie. Now I usually like all of these, but the best part of all three would be the ice cream and strawberries.  The Key Lime Pie was not too bad, but nothing extra. Something different was the fact that the Strawberry Shortcake was made with a biscuit instead of cake, which kind of took away from your traditional thought of what a strawberry shortcake tastes like.   Oh, and I can't forget the wine as part of the Restaurant Week menu. Probably the best for me.   Overall, location, parking, and wine were my highlights."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for years. Will not be back. Every time I eat here I get a little sick. May or may not be a coincidence."}
{"text":"We love the Cobb salad here !! They had a fish dish last week that my husband had - it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Gluten free diners beware-I had an unfortunate experience at this location recently. I've dined at this location a few times in the past and was informed by a number of servers that several of the menu options were gluten free or could be prepared gluten free. During my most recent visit, when I asked the server which gluten free options were available, she informed me (quite snidely I may add) that they \"were not doctors and couldn't say which options were gluten free because people might still have a reaction.\" Quite concerning as I'd been ensured that items such as the veggie burger were prepared gluten free in the past. Anyway, long story short, we ended up paying for our drinks and heading elsewhere. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"131 Main begins with a serene decor inside, and  there's a great outdoor patio with tables and a firepit. I have consistently had great food & top notch service. If you sit at the bar, the bartenders are well educated and make you feel at home. Tuesdays is half price bottles of wine all day, and half price starters til 7pm. Of course, it gets crowded so get there early to get a spot at the bar, or make reservations for the dining room."}
{"text":"Wow. Nice place. Great waiter. Apps - smoked salmon and corn bread were awesome. Deviled eggs ok.  Lunch - crab cakes great, filet medallions very good. Metropolis salad very good. Cocktails superb. Without hesitation would come back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! I have eaten there several times both at this location in Dilworth and the one in Asheville.  The service staff is friendly and consistent, and the ambiance is intimate.  Also, the food is incredible!  They advertise that they have no freezers for any of their food, and I can definitely taste the difference; it's really fresh!   I love this restaurant, the service, the food and the vibe.  It is also very convenient that they have complementary valet parking as well as a bar next door that allows you to bring over the menu from 131 Main."}
{"text":"This place is great for special occasions or on dates. Also, this restaurant is good for picky eater. I took my parents to eat there. We truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food there. Nothing can go wrong with its food. If you go you have to get the cast iron cornbread. Its cornbread is to die for and it comes with honey in the jar that you can put it on your cornbread. 131 makes the perfect cornbread. My dad had the fish taco ,and it comes with torilla chips and guacamole and salsa. The fish taco comes with two fish tacos and if you want the dinner portion is three fish tacos. The lunch portion is huge! Mom had the fish sandwich and it is not the ordinary fish sandwich you get at the regular chain restaurants. Its fish sandwich is grilled and the fish is thick like the steak. The only suggestion I will give is don't get the veggie burger because it wasn't that great. The veggie burger is made with red bean so it doesn't taste great. Also, 131 makes the best slaw and it is very unique than the other slaw you get from other restaurants. I also ordered two drinks for my parents. I ordered the 131 Mainiac and Mr. Tea. Both drinks were excellent. Service was great! We were too full to get dessert. Next time I will get the banana cream pie. If you go to dinner, the lightning is dark. You can call it romantic or you don't really want to see what your dates look like. I wish I can give ten stars to this restaurant. The bill wasn't bad. It came less than 100 dollars. In Vegas, this place would cost more."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I don't mind \"paying\" for a nice meal at all but I thought it was just A LITTLE over priced. The food was alright and the service was GREAT. I won't go out of my way to come back but I'm not saying I won't come back...  we DID enjoy ourselves, nice atmosphere....  Just not impressed."}
{"text":"Went for valentines day...HORRIBLE! If only I could rate my experience a 0... HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!! Seriously took 30+mins for a freaking straw, my server Nicole past by our table multiple times. No refills until after I had finished eating and one before I left. I ordered 12oz hand cut and my gf ordered the glazed chicken. Prices was alil high $27 for a steak that somehow was cooked half medium well/ half well done? Couldn't ask my waitress about it cause she was no where to be found. Not giving the benefit of the doubt because clearly we was forgotten/ignored. Lucky I didn't just walk out due to the EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE....Every customer should be valued, whether it's their first time there or 20th visit. first and last time NEVER GOING BACK! Btw I only knew my waitress name because the receipt.... great job 131 main!   FUTURE CUSTOMERS YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try 131 Main for years, and finally got the chance during Queen's Feast/Restaurant week.    My husband and I looked over the restaurant week menus and chose 131 Main for the ribs.  When I went to order the ribs, they were sold out!  I will say that I was disappointed, but didn't let it ruin my experience at the fantastic restaurant.    We had: Caesar Salad & Deviled Eggs Appetizers Ribeye and French Fries Entree  Strawberry Shortcake and Brownie Desserts  *Everything was excellent.  Pre-warning, if you like sweet desserts, the strawberry shortcake is on a biscuit which is very salty, not a typical strawberry shortcake dessert.  The Brownie was AMAZING and enough for 2 or 3 people to share.    The atmosphere inside the restaurant is so cozy, warm and inviting.  It's really a perfect spot for a date night, celebration dinner or get together with friends.  I enjoyed it immensely.  The service was fantastic, friendly and prompt.  The management team was visible, helpful and friendly.  I will definitely be back to try the ribs another time!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised at how good it was tonight. I hadn't come to 131 main in about 7 years because the last time the food was nasty, but it was someone's bday and they wanted to come here tonight so I very unwillingly obliged. The trout is the best fish in the State, grilled to perfection with the garlic aioli. The salmon was also spectacular."}
{"text":"Took a gentleman I was interviewing and his wife out to dinner here.  It's casual with decent food.  Started with the corn bread appetizer.  Not the best corn bread I have ever had. I won't get that again.    I had the salmon grilled on a cedar plank.  Was tasty, even though I don't typically enjoy salmon.  The wild rice salad was not the best."}
{"text":"Just hands down, all around excellent in all regards... Food, service, ambiance. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It reminds me of a restaurant called Houston's that I used to frequent in Boca Raton. Also, a lot like J. Alexander's but will BETTER food."}
{"text":"I have written a few reviews of 131 Main and they have stood the test of time over the years.  Restaurant is still there and usually pretty busy.  Experience is always great.  We went today after church so Sunday around 12:30 for you heathens.  Restaurant is clean, well decorated and there was a decent crowd.  Sweetie and I sat down and saw that it seems like they've raised their prices.  $22 for a Prime Rib Sandwich & Fries is a bit high imo.  I decided on the grouper sandwich ($22) with fries and Sweetie ordered the catch of the day which was Swordfish tacos ($16).  We drank water as to stop the bleeding.    Food arrived and it was AMAZING as always.  The grouper seemed fresh, and the whole dish was memorable.  Fries were hand cut and right out of the fryer served perfectly.  Sweetie enjoyed her tacos along with fresh guacamole and salsa.  The service was also amazing, they do a great job of training the waiters and waitresses to be attentive and not bothersome.  Wonderful!  All said, the meal and experience were great!  I'll keep going.  Although the prices are high all in for 2 lunch entrees and 2 waters it was like $42 which, for lunch is a bit much.  But as always, the food and service were excellent so there's that."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I went to 131 Main and it was awful. Other than the coleslaw and Caesar side salad being great, the whole experience was a nightmare and huge disappointment. But we're not reviewing that time, because as I called the next day and spoke to the manager letting him know how shocked I was that THE 131 Main fell so short on service and food.  He profusely apologized and offered a $50 credit if we'd give him another shot - classy move . 2 weeks later, we went back, and here's the story of visit #2:  Ambiance is nice, waitress was cheerful and we chose the $59 meal for two. The Double Dip app was great (their queso is like pimento cheese - cold, not hot!), and we both had the Caesar salads (yum) to start.  The issue comes with the entree. My date got the meatloaf and it was cold as a brick when it came out to us. Additionally, his mashed potatoes were cold too but the zucchini was hot and delicious. My meal, the Fish and Grits, was delicious though not spicy as advertised on the menu. We asked for the banana cream pie for dessert, only to be told that they were out of everything but the brownie al la mode (good, but not what we wanted). Seems weird for a Thursday night at 830 to be out of almost everything..... but then again, I don't own a restaurant so who knows.  Overall, I'm disappointed. I wanted to love this place, but the quality of food and experiences I've had made it impossible. The coleslaw and salad were good though..... :)"}
{"text":"Good food!  Excellent personable service. Owner and family great. They just got ability to serve beer and wine. Totally recommend it. If we lived nearby would get take out too regularly!"}
{"text":"Two friends highly recommended 131 Main and I was sold when they said that the restaurant doesn't have any freezers because their ingredients are just that fresh. I celebrated my birthday here and my stomach & I couldn't have been more satisfied! My uber-picky Charlottean boyfriend (born & bred) boldly proclaimed, \"I just found my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!\"  I liked the clean and sleek look of the restaurant, as well as the dim lighting and well-distanced booths & tables, which created a quiet and intimate vibe. And I love that the restaurant emphasizes the use of fresh ingredients and  sustainably-grown & locally-produced wines.  What we ordered: - \"Awesome\" Roast Beef Sandwich ($14) - Ahi Tuna Salad ($15) - 131 Mainiac cocktail ($9)  The 131 Mainiac is so tiny but SO fantastic, one of the best original cocktails I've ever had. I'm usually weary of trying original cocktail concoctions, because they're often overwhelmed with a mess of fruity syrups and none of the subtlety and kick.  We started out with one entree each (but shared both) because none of the appetizers really stood out to us. The \"awesome\" roast beef sandwich was tender and juicy with the au jus, but tasted even better with horseradish cream (it's not included by default, so be sure to request it!). I think it kind of lived up to its name, but I don't think it'd win against Lawry's Carvery.  The ahi tuna salad was AMAZING. The tuna was seared and seasoned to perfection, the dressing wasn't overpowering and complemented the tuna very well. Loved the bits of avocado and mango!  When we finished both entrees feeling only semi-full, the loverboy looked at me and said,  \"I kind of want another ahi tuna salad. You down?\"  \"HECK YES I'M DOWN.\"  So we shared a second ahi tuna salad in lieu of dessert, which was fine by me!  If I come back to Charlotte, 131 Main will be the first restaurant I visit!"}
{"text":"Overpriced average food.  Great space and location but it missed mark again.  I had special which was mahi mahi.  It was a 5 oz filet they probably got from teeter for $6.  It came with steamed broccoli , about 1/4 of a cup max.  No starch.  The fish had no seasoning and was pan seared.  It's what any bad home cook would have done but less food.  It was $28!   Seriously?  I want to like this place but its mediocre food with a Dilworth premium.  Wine prices are good and artichoke app is excellent but a little oily.  Would go to bar again but after 3 tries to like restaurant , I'm done."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars to 131 Main for the food and the service.  Both were very good. I just can't see spending that much money for the meal when there are so many good options in Charlotte. To give you an idea - 2 martinis, 1 soda, 1 appetizer, 1 hamburger, 1 fish tacos (3 tacos)  and 1 steak thai salad (which only had noodles, no greens) with tip $95.00.  I know everyone who goes loves the place and the food is good, but why hasn't any said that you are going to be spending some money on your meal (and you are in Blakeney)."}
{"text":"A nice upscale, though casual establishment.  Whether it is drinks or dinner, either is a good experience.  Nice staff, excellent decor and great food make it a stellar experience for me.  Throw in complimentary valet and the experience can be an excellent.  If you are heading down East Blvd, look them up."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and loved it! We were graciously greeted and seated by the attentive hostesses to start off our experience. For dinner we did their 'Main Event', a $69 dinner for two: a bottle of red or white house wine, 2 salads or soups, one appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert. You can't choose from anything on the menu (there are designated items) but its a great deal! We started with the Cast Iron Cornbread and it was delicious. My husband got a caesar salad and I got their soup of the day. For entrees we got the Shrimp and Grits (soooo yummy) and the Marinated Prime Rib with smashed potatoes. And lastly, for dessert we got a massive piece of house-made key lime pie with the whipped cream on the side. Everything was great and we'll definitely be back! Julie was our server and she was fantastic; she was very friendly, energetic, attentive and gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"I often eat here for lunch but this has become my Tuesday night spot with $5 Appetizers (Sunday -Thursday from 5-7 pm) and half priced bottles of wine (Tuesday only).  Everything is great from the scallops, double dip grilled, artichokes to anything on their great wine menu."}
{"text":"Had an amazing steak filet special, cooked to perfection. Had two vodka tonics while waiting which were somewhat strong. We had a large group and it was really disappointing to find out that some of our group could not sit at the same table we were at because the tables are bolted to the floor and cannot be placed together. It's pricey so bring your wallet. I spent just under $80 for myself with the meal and two drinks. The ambiance is fun and lively, but the acoustics do make it difficult to hear other people speaking. The bar was packed and had lots of happy hour specials, it looked like the place to network. It's dimly lit making it great for a date night."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and enjoyed the outdoor seating.  Food was very good and the staff was friendly.  The cornbread is moist and delicious and the banana cream pie is made from scratch and awesome!  Pricing was reasonable for one meal, but incredible for getting two out of it.  Really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant ! Service was good as well as the food ! I tried their shrimp and grits and was very surprised ... Seemed as if I received more shrimp than grits ! I had one drink which had the right amount of sweetness for a Martini . I valet parked and my car was delivered promptly ! Overall I had a nice dining experience and I will try this place again!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, they freeze nothing. Totally unreal, this is why I get the crab cakes every time - 100% fresh seafood. Iceberg salad is great, I find the blue cheese a little strong but still good.   You can't go wrong here, for the price you get the value."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took his parents that were visiting from out of state here for dinner and overall had a good experience. The deviled eggs and cornbread are a must try appetizer. We brought two bottles of our own wine and loved the fact that 131 Main doesn't charge a corkage fee! I ordered the ribeye however they were out of the pineapple soy sauce glaze so I'm bummed I didn't get to try it with that marinade however it was still very good without it. I will call our service decent solely because of the long periods of waiting for our server to come back to the table other then that, will try again soon!"}
{"text":"This was one of my weekly stops for lunch during the work week.  My standard order would be the wedge with the Thai steak.  The portion use to be huge, the tomatoes were blood red.  Now when I go in I get half the food the tomatoes are so poor they get shifted to the side.  Did they cut the price by half, NOPE.  Eating at 131 is a premium over other restaurants which I don't mind when I get what I pay for.  I have also been pretty disappointed in the amount of time it takes to get the food to the table.  Wonderful atmosphere, but honestly that is where it stops.  Save your money."}
{"text":"The main event is big time.  Give it a try and you won't leave disappointed nor hungry.  The specialty drinks are awesome too.  The Mr Tea and Prickly Pear are both really good.  Great place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Only been to the one in Dilworth but since that one is closed I will be trying the Ballyntine location out. Always really great food!! Marinated Ribeye is to die for and grilled artichokes are a definite must try!!!!"}
{"text":"131 Main is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in town. And judging by how many people have been there the last few times I've shown up, I'm not alone here.   131 Main is great for lunch, dinner or drinks--and is really convenient if you live anywhere near East Blvd. Seems like it'd be a great place for a Power Lunch; I've only gone for drinks and dinner. And every time has been better than the last.   It's decently pricey, but well worth it. Order the Plank Salmon--it's roasted and comes with wild rice. I always start my meals off with the blue cheese wedge, which is amazing--freezing cold, with amazing dressing and tomatoes. You should also make room for the corn bread, which comes with jalapenos cooked in it and is served with honey. Some other favorites of mine are the ribs and the trout, both of which are amazing.   As for drinks, 131 has a great selection of wine, as well as some great specialty drinks. Start your meal off with a martini or a mojito--both are great.   If you're at 131 for cocktails only, you can either enjoy a seat at the giant bar inside (good post-work scene) or the deck outside, which is open and airy but unfortunately right on East."}
{"text":"By far the best customer service I've experienced in years! Food was exceptional! As I was walking around the restaurant with my curious 2-year-old son, the owner, Billie, stopped by to introduce himself and offered to show us around the kichen. Billy generously gave us a tour of the kichen, which was remarkably clean and full of cheerful, polite, and hardworking chefs, runners, etc. I think this is the first time that I've ever taken the time to post a review on Yelp...that's how wonderful our experience was at 131 Main!"}
{"text":"This place tries to be like a fine dining establishment but falls short. The service was horrible. Our waiter had the personality of a rock. He came back only one time to top off our drinks. We ordered grilled chicken and out came grilled cheese. The bread on the roast beef sandwich tasted stale. Crab cakes tasted like they came from the frozen section of the local grocery aisle. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm from Maryland and honestly have just stopped ordering crab cakes at restaurants because they are always pale in comparison to ones back home. 131 Main for sure got the crab cakes right! I loved the flavor and sauce it came with along with the salad. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes. Also, service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Dilworth restaurant on a recommendation by family.  The service was very good, lots of attention and knowledge of the menu.  The food was very disappointing.  The best part of the meal was the smashed potatoes.  The appetiizer cornbread started off looking good but after about 3 bites my taste buds were puzzled wondering if this was cake, bread, or a sorry attempt at making a fruit cake.  We both got P:rime Rib and my jaw muscles began to cramp up and I ended up having to spit out some of the meat because I just couldn't chew it!  The meat was absolutely some of the toughest beef I have ever tried to eat including steaks purchased from Food Lion in the reduced price section.  I got the caeser salad and the dressing was bland and lacked taste.  Very disappointing meal and I wont be wasting my money on this 131 joint anymore,  If you are planning to go for Goodness sake don't get any beef unless you are a gum chewing champion.  If you want a steak go across the street East Blvd, and go to Outback.  Pretty sad food for sure."}
{"text":"My family was seated outside by the hostess. We waited 15 minutes. No server. Went inside and told the hostess no one had been to the table. Waited 5 more minutes, still no server. We got up and left. I mean, really??!!  After the above noted experience, the manager of the restaurant totally made it right and we had a virtually perfect meal there. This is what separates great restaurants from average ones! Will definitely return again now!"}
{"text":"So far amazing pineapple soy sauce ribeye... you must try... and key lime pie is just wonderful the crust is just delicous with pecans!!! I have also tried the ribs and corn bread is yummy!! Take advantage of restaurant week. Great deals."}
{"text":"I eat out frequently and was eager to try 131 Main as I'd heard so much about it.  My dining partner and I stopped by several weeks ago and  I'm still thinking about how the experience was.  The food was simply bad.  I ordered a hamburger - hard to mess up a hamburger.  It was way over-salted, although the french fries were great.  My lunch companion did not fare as well.  Her salad, which had been ordered with dressing on the side, came to her literally SOAKED in dressing.  I'm sure they would have fixed this, although too many hidden camera shows have frightened both of us into never sending food back.  On to her salmon...  it was not plated poorly (looked like a previous customer's leftovers) and had little to no flavor.    I initially thought the service was great - loved the team service, but then oddly, while we were in the middle of dinner, our primary server brought the check.  No offer of \"Would you like anything else?\" as is customary and happening at the tables of another server.   The experience was so negative I can't possibly recommend this restaurant.  Frankly, I'm surprised by all the positive reviews and friends who had suggested this establishment. Maybe there was a time when it was great, but that time has clearly passed.  This place is over-priced for the low-caliber of food, the interior decor is like an inexpensive diner, and there are too many superior restaurants to choose from that offer better food value and eating experience."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I have been here 3 times now. The first time I got the crab cakes which were excellent. The second and third times here, I got the shrimp and grits. It is a little pricey at $19 but it was excellent on our second visit. The third visit however was quite a mess. When they brought our food, mine was poorly played with very little Creole sauce and a very haphazard looking plate. When the waitress came by,I asked her if it was supposed to look like this and she took it back to the kitchen. They obviously had to cook another dish entirely as it took at least 15 minutes for the new plating. It was better when they brought out the new entree; however, my boyfriend was already finished with his fish tacos so our experience of dining together was ruined. So once again, MANAGERS, if you diner experiences a screw up, attempt to offer them something to make up for YOUR lack of oversight. The dish was replaced satisfactorily so no need to come the entree but at the very least, you could have offered us dessert on the house, with a sincere apology. I saw managers viewing the food going out of the kitchen. I suppose they missed my entree. Do not know if we will return considering the overall lack of concern with inconsistent and poor playing."}
{"text":"Recently moved to CLT from NY and this was one of the first places we tried since its close by. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. We had the roast beef sandwich and the crab cake salad  which were both really good! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very high quality food here.  I had a couple of Vodka Soda Waters here and let me tell you they aren't cheap with their drinks!    Our table ordered the Deviled Eggs (which were great but nothing terribly shockingly out of the ordinary with them), Scallops, and Smoked Salmon for appetizers.  I would highly recommend the Scallops and Smoked Salmon.    For the Entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf special which was the Filet and Scallops.  MMmmmmm they were to die for! I think the next time I go, I will definitely order the Pork Chops or the Ribs."}
{"text":"The food is consistently fresh and very good but the current dinner menu is more like a lunch menu and not nearly as expansive as the previous dinner menus.  With that said, 131 Main is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Dinner June 11   This is a very classy, upscale type place that I had very high hopes for, but unfortunately I cant give more than an average rating.    Here's what I liked:    - The ambience    - The wait staff - very attentive and friendly    - Grilled Flounder was cooked and seasoned perfectly    - The accompanying Aioli with the Trout was fantastic    - The Meatloaf was unique tasting with a nice crispy crust and tasty center    - Cornbread appetizer was very large and was pretty good    - Homemade Creamy Garlic salad dressing was outstanding!   Here's what I didn't like:    - Appetizers were few (need more variety and offerings)    - Double Dip appetizer - Pimento Cheese was not mixed thoroughly as every bite seemed different - either overly flavorful or just bland!     - Tortilla Chips just didn't seem a good pairing with the Pimento Cheese. Chips were good with Guacamole, but think a pita chip or some type cracker would of been better.     - In the side salad the red cabbage was so bitter that it over powered every bite I took and made the salad almost inedible - dressing was great     - I ordered Trout and it just came out on the plate, with no side or anything accompanying it.  When I asked, the waitress was like oh yeah, it should come with rice or broccoli.  Shouldn't someone of noticed just a piece of fish alone on the plate before it was sent out?     - The person that ordered Meatloaf asked for Fries (not mashed potatoes) and his plate arrived with the Mashed.  Informed waitress and  he eventually got a side order of fries.    ++ that's 2 orders out of 4 that came out wrong!  At a restaurant like this that shouldn't happen.      Yes I would go back at some point, but there are many places I want to try before I give them another chance."}
{"text":"OK- I am giving them 4 stars because I like the artichoke appetizer that much. It is absolutely delicious.   The menu is very boring. The rest of the food doesn't inspire me.  The artichoke appetizer is to die for. With a bottle of white wine. Heaven."}
{"text":"The proximity of this restaurant was honestly a strong selling point for my wife and I buying our home. The real estate agent even gave us a gift card there after we closed on the house. Bar and fire pit area are as cozy as a regular seat. Tuesday's are half price wine night. Usually very crowded then. My wife also craves the artichoke appetizer and a Metropolis salad. The banana cream pie dessert is AMAZING, and we would never order that anywhere else. Don't waste time on a burger here. The buns overwhelm the meat and it's bland. I usually switch up my order, but love the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Wow, called to make a reservation for a business dinner and was told they don't take reservations for large parties. So you want me to show up with a 15 executives with barely enough time to eat and no reservation or guaranteed table upon their arrival. Makes it even worse is that the manager was curt with me. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"This place has a left such an impression on my memory and has been deemed one of my favorite restaurants.  I love the food here.  I had the cedar plank salmon...hmm hmm good is all I can say.  Try the cornbread...nice compliments of sweet, spice, and flavor!    Great place for a date or eating alone....fantastic service!  If you are in Charlotte, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Our party got ribs, chicken, trout and a double cut pork chop.  Everything tasted great.  We had the cast iron corn bread as an app and peanut butter  pie for dessert.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars because I like this place alot, just dont think its that inventive.  Excellent well made food.  Loved the ahi tuna and if you are a grilled artichoke person you will love this yummy garlicky version.  Good solid dishes- to the restaurant though- have a few really inventive dishes to surprise people with and you could go straight to 5 star!  Cozy elegant atmoshere that is not too formal and not so nice as you feel bad bringing kids.  I gotta go, writing this has made me want to go back and get the grilled artichoke..."}
{"text":"Get the smoked salmon and the cornbread!!! Those are two of my absolute favorite things on the menu.  I don't think I've ever been here and not ordered the smoked salmon! It's served with toast points and an herb aioli that they make in house.  The cornbread is made and served in a cast iron skillet with honey ok the side.  The salads are all great. And huge! My favorite thing about the salads is the croutons. They make them from the corn bread!!  This is a good date night spot. Or a nice place to bring friends and family. We've celebrated a few occasions here.  The servers are always knowledgeable and friendly. I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"On my first visit I had a Thai salad.  The best I've had outside Thailand itself.  Fresh and whole ingredients - prepared with a modern flair and pizazz!  I eat healthy and menu provided plenty of interesting entrees with varied flavor pallette.  The mood and ambience is top notch without distracting music.  The service was professionally trained to culinary standards - not something you get very often anymore.  And the service is what topped this review off at 5 stars vs a place that just has great food."}
{"text":"Sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere. The lights are very dim inside and it gives off a suave, intimate dining experience, especially on a date. The menu is quite unique...anything from a good cut of beef to an interesting clever seared salmon dish to traditional Carolina shrimp & grits. Good wine selection, and ample bar space. Make a reservation for sure if it is a weekend! Staff is pleasant and accommodating. Good Blakeney/Ballantyne experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 2 locations and I have to say both were awesome. Scared that all I'm going to find in NC is fried foods, and unhealthy options  --no way! This place prides itself on providing the freshest ingredients and I have to say it Delivers!   Service: Our servers name was Steven. He was awesome, very attentive, gave suggestions on the menu and what wines would pair well with the specials.   Food: Apps: Grilled Artichokes: an interesting take, very good sauce, but prepped w/a little too much oil, still very tasty        Wedge Salad: Extremely fresh tomatoes, perfectly cooked bacon, awesome blue cheese, nice dressing on the side  Main Course: We both had the Cod special, it was to die for!! The cod was cooked perfectly, large portion, it came with some type of cous cous salad that was incredible--it had cranberries, some type of legumes and 15 other ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it.    Salmon: I had the salmon at the first restaurant. It was cooked on a cedar board, cooked to perfection, huge piece of fish, side complimented it nicely   Drinks: I had two types of wine: one was organic (never heard of organic wine) so I tried it. Very good Chardonnay, second I had a delicious Malbec, my friend had margaritas which he said were awesome! Strong and nice size glass."}
{"text":"Two words....CRAB CAKES....hell yeah!  They are the real deal as you would expect (99% lump crab meat).  The place is always classy and the bar area is usually very busy on the weekends.  The outside seating is very nice as well and the service has never been anything but top notch.  I've also had the burger with fries, very good as well!"}
{"text":"For a consistently good meal with great atmosphere and service in the Dilworth area, look no further than 131 Main. The food is fresh (no freezer on site) and has a different spin then most other American fare restaurants.   The double dip appetizer (guacamole and pimento cheese with tortilla chips) is absolutely amazing. And the fresh fish is prepared differently every day and is always a good choice. Others I've dined with have commented on how good the steaks are, and the homemade salad dressings are my favorite of any restaurant in the area. And please do not leave without getting the cornbread; it's served warm in a cast iron skillet with honey for slathering on top. And then there's dessert - you MUST have the banana cream pie. Delish.   The atmosphere is casual and the patio (with fireplace) is a great area in which to sit with good food/drinks and to socialize with friends. The bar area is quite large and a great place to grab a drink with friends or order up a quick meal. The martini list is different from other locales and the full bar and beer/wine won't disappoint. Overall great dining experience."}
{"text":"My sissy loves this place and I must say their food isn't bad. However, on my latest visit my food wasn't how I remembered. However just like people restaurant have off days too, so I will give it another try soon. Their desert was awesome I love their brownie a' la mode. Oh how I wish I had one now. For lunch I love their chicken fingers when I'm going lighter."}
{"text":"This is a must. This place has exceptional food. The menus isn't huge but it's a good size. They have a great wine / drink menu. The service is always top notch and they staff is awesome! My two favorite meals are the Filet and the Slow Roasted chicken. This place is very popular and can get very busy so know you may wait to be seated. They have a few locations."}
{"text":"The grilled artichokes, Guac and  crab cakes are a must. Decent sized glasses of wine and good service."}
{"text":"Good drinks but services spoke to everyone but us not sure why??? Need to be careful  who you choose to wine and dine  Charlotte hornets won't be there anytime soon . Have a nice night and try not to be rude next time ! Never know who it might be!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambience, excellent food, and great service.  My husband and I typically dine at 131 Main for lunch and we share a Roast Beef (French Dip) sandwich and a Wedge Salad.  We have been there for lunch and dinner and have tried many of their sandwiches, salads, and the burger and all are very good, but we actually crave the French Dip and Wedge Salad and find ourselves going there specifically for that."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. The food and service is always on point. I enjoy the ambiance, but I'm certain days I wish it were a little brighter."}
{"text":"Had a beautiful date here. The service was absolutely great, both friendly and informative. They had several specials running, including half priced wine on Sundays. I had the crab-cakes and my date had the special which was a steak and crab-cake pairing, we both loved our dishes. I was able to try the steak which was particularly tasty - and had a nice grilled flavor.  I will say they are not skimpy on portion sizes- so come hungry.  I will definitely come back to 131 Main !"}
{"text":"My family (a party of 9) had a late lunch. This is my second time here (we're from NYC), and the first time for the other family members (they're from Phoenix and Raleigh). Everyone was extremely happy with the food and service. Valerie took care of us and was nice enough to bring us a Strawberry shortcake dessert. We will definitely be back the next time we visit Charlotte! Thank you for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Just an update to give them an extra star based on their customer service.  I was reached out to by the manager who wanted to get more information about my experience so he could talk to his team.  He was very apologetic and I was impressed that they followed through!  I'll make another trip back and hopefully have a much better experience!  :)"}
{"text":"Fine dinning prices, for kitchen manger food. The food is sub par, and more inline with what you get at Chilis. So if you want over pay for your  dinner, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I'd been craving crab. This crab cake salad was all that!! Talk about a palate pleaser! So very delicious. I devoured the entire salad.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I hope to update this review soon, but it wasn't a good experience on my first review.  I'm a huge fan of the 131 Main chain, but this was not good.  While we were in Huntersville, we were regulars at the restaurant.  We made reservations via OpenTable for 7:45 on a cold Saturday night.  We arrived five minutes early and were informed that their reservations are running around a 40 minute wait.  What is the point of having reservations if you can't run your service to accommodate them?  There are plenty of restaurants in Charlotte that don't offer reservations because of this very point.  As a result of this, we were in fact late for the event we were to attend following.  After we were finally seated an hour later, we were the very first table by the door and it was extremely cold.  That's hard for a restaurant to overcome but it just wasnt' fun being cold the entire evening after having to wait so long to be seated.  We initally ordered wine and water.  The Pinot Noir arrived extremely cold, as a white wine would.  To those wondering, I'm fully aware that red is to have a slight chill to it but this was very cold.  We also had to remind the server for the water as the food arrived.  As always with the other locations, the food was fantastic.  My wife had the trout which was grilled perfectly and so fresh.  I had the Thai Steak salad which was also wonderful.  We ended up just corking the wine and drinking it later that night after it warmed up.    Being Dilworth residents, we'll definitely be back and in hopes of a better experience!"}
{"text":"Some freinds an I visited during restraunt week, very excited the menu looked great.  first on the menu online it was pick 1 for an app, when we got there the menu read pick 1 per couple or per table.  there were 6 of us, they gave us a crabcake, brushetta 4, pimento dip w/ chips.  We received our salads the ceasar dressing had a mustard base, not good than on the menu it stated it came with cornbread croutons.  I had one crouton on my salad.  They brought our main entree however we had finished our salads and were waiting for them to clear our table.  our bowls were at the end of our table while we first began our main entree.  I ordered the Trout w/ crabmeat the most wonderful fish i have ever put in my mouth.  We also had the Chicken Pallard very good, the Prime Rib which was wonderful however the mashed potatoes no taste.  Desert was the same the apps so of course we shared , the brownie was not tasteful, not creamy, smooth chocolate. The key lime pie was okay the pie didnt have that really tart flavor.  Apps were good and entrees ."}
{"text":"Great food, always consistent. Nice atmosphere, love the outdoor patio. Wish they had more sides to choose from on menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I started going here when we first moved to the area from NYC.  We really like the food and have gone at least once a month, taking many visitors here over the past year and a half.  It's funny, because I used Yelp to look up the phone number and thought \"Why only 4 stars?\".  I thought it was a fluke when we tried to make reservations on Saturday and got turned away.  So I called today to make reservations for my birthday two weeks out, and they told me that they do not take reservations for parties of more than 4! \"Okay, so what is the process?\" I asked, after hearing they no longer have a call ahead list either.  Basically they told me I would have to come 1.5hrs prior to when I HOPE to be seated. So get a group of my friends to sit and wait around, hoping we will be seated in 1.5hrs (or more?!?!) and then risk our plans afterward?  No, thank you! Even Michelin Star restaurants are more accommodating.  I have no idea what they think they're running there, though I'm astounded by the nerve!  I guess we will have to take this restaurant off of our list due to the lack of respect for their patrons."}
{"text":"We've lived in the Blakeney area for years now and finally had the chance to get over to 131 for lunch. My husband and I both wanted the same dish (Ahi Tuna salad) but I ended up ordering it and he got the Mahi.  The Ahi Tuna was perfect and so fresh. It paired nicely with the ginger sauce.  My husband said his dish was good but wish the fish wasn't so soaked in butter (may not be a bad thing). Service was excellent, my half/half ice-tea filled glass was never empty. I hope to get back over there for dinner the next time we have a  date night without the baby."}
{"text":"Great food and Always consistent!! One of my favorite and go to's! Would recommend the Thai steak salad.. DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Not only is this our \"go-to\" spot for date nights but tonight our service was TOP NOTCH! My husband and I went out for a few apps and brought our own bottle of wine for an early and inexpensive date night. We felt like they rolled out the red carpet for us. Our server, Danielle, was AMAZING! She was perfectly attentive and anticipated our every need. Brought us extra tortilla chips for our double dips, kept refilling our wine glasses, more water, etc. When we finished up we couldn't help but share our love for Danielle with the manager, Mark. Even he was extremely gracious. Just a top notch night for a very grateful and loyal couple. Thanks, 131, and Danielle for reminding why this our favorite place to eat out. You rock!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite casual restaurants in the Dilworth area. The food is fresh & delicious and the atmosphere is inviting & friendly. The pear mojito is incredible and they have a nice selection of moderately priced wines by the glass. The scallops, crab cake salad, ribs and banana cream pie are standouts."}
{"text":"Best service ever food delicious this is by far my favorite restaurant so far since I moved to Charlotte. I will be back often and be sure to bring my family and friends."}
{"text":"131 Main is a great spot for a business lunch or a dinner date. Starting with the cornbread is a must. It comes in a skillet with a bottle of honey. It is pretty sweet and probably would make a great dessert too. With clients recently half the table of 8 got the fish tacos and all were very happy. At lunch I have a hard time ordering anything but the Ahi Tuna Salad or Thai Steak Salad. Both are great lunch portions and very fresh. As the menu says they don't even own a freezer here, everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Wow what has happened to this place? They were great the last 3 times I was there. Tonight we had a mannequin for a waiter. They should have placed a device inside the poor guy and saved some money on a real waiter. Did I say it was a birthday?? Hello what about a cheap Happy Birthday or a lousy piece of cake for my girl?? The place was empty and I guess I know why now. The fish tasted like the grill had not been cleaned since before Christmas. Too Bad"}
{"text":"I'm not a fish eater but the fish tacos were greay. Bombay Chai hot tea excellent.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I just read the stupidest review from someone who was whining about 131 Main not having a kids' menu.  This person even admitted that they knew it wasn't a kid-friendly restaurant.  More whining ensued regarding the pricing of the kids' entrees.  Really?! Next time, go to Applebee's.    131 Main has always delivered great food, and the atmosphere is always pleasant.  Why?  No obnoxious children.  I will frequent 131 Main more often for this reason."}
{"text":"Heard about the \"Main Event\". $59 per couple (includes a bottle of wine)! That's crazy! Was extremely surprised as to how good the food and service was. Our server (Natalie) gave us some suggestions and had a great personality. We shared the corn bread app, each had a salad. Then I had grilled trout and my guest had the ribeye! Too full... Had to take the banana pie home.  We will go back... Soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with some great benefits for the locals.  If you are in walking distance you can bring your dog and lunch on the patio, a nice Saturday afternoon.  Mel the manager there is attentive fun and open to feedback on the menu.  He is trying to new recipes and even brought some to our table free.  The staff is friendly and attentive a great \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"The cornbread in the skillet is my favorite! We have to get it every time we come here, and the outdoor seating is great in the summer. Love the ribs and their salmon, everything is on point here!"}
{"text":"I must admit 131 is one of my go to spots when I don't feel like cooking.  Veggie Burger is Great! Fresh Veggies. Cornbread Is Great! Fish Tacos are Good also. Grilled Fresh Fish Also Good! Although Im not much of a drinker, the 131 Maniac is a great night cap! Good place and pretty consistent food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The staff..very friendly and very attentive. I had the pork chop with the red smashed potatoes...the pork chop was hugh..very tender and juicy! I loved it..seasoned to perfection. The skillet cornbread was good but 9$ is way too much. The curry corn was different..loved the freshness of the corn and Curry was on point! This is now my go to spot for a nice dinner!!"}
{"text":"Food and service always great when able to get in. Tried to get reservations last night for party of 6. Was told they don't take reservations for parties of more than 4. Frustrated with reservation protocol. Went there anyway and was told the wait was 2 hrs. How ridiculous is that? As a result we went to Bonefish. Called ahead and got seated upon arrival. Food and service also great."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service .  Mediocre food (except the smoker salmon--delicious...but definitely not worth putting up with the awful service."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here-casual atmosphere with plenty of booth seating and outdoor fire pit area.   Mid-range prices, parking lot, efficient staff."}
{"text":"Normally when I eat at 131 Main Restaurants (because there are more than one in the area) I am pleased.  However, twice in the past two months I have run into an issue.  This most recent issue caused me to document my experience in Yelp.  On Mother's Day in May 2018 (exact date unknown), I ordered the Danish Half Back Ribs with mashed potatoes, and the Kale Salad.  And though I only tasted a very small amount I ordered the banana pudding for desert. Also, I order a water with lemon and a Pearfection Martini to drink.  Later that night I found myself in the Emergency Room with extreme nausea and regurgitation.  Now I am not sure if it was the food, but I wanted to give the history as to why I decided to write here this evening.  Afterwards I had planned not to ever again revisit the restaurant. On June 26, I met a contractor at the one located in Southpark.  We ordered the cornbread as a starter.  However, it was not thoroughly cooked so we sent it back.  We requested not to have another one.  The contractor was so disappointed that she did not order any additional food to eat.  However, I order their grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  Again we both ordered their great Pearfection (this is the BEST Martini).  The chicken was not cooked through either because we could still see the rawness inside of it.  We communicated the issue to the manager, but she tried to say it was the lighting.  I told her it was not the lighting, and that the chicken was undercooked.  I even spat out the one bite I took from it because it was so disgusting, and I did not want to again become ill.  After I left I contacted the general manager and made him aware of the issue.  He apologized.  As in my previous review on Yelp I am quite concerned about whether the restaurants care about the Black experience in their restaurants here in Charlotte.  Although Therapy is no longer downtown I recall in 2008 when I first moved to Charlotte and went there for drinks.  My friend immediately complained about the price of the Martinis.  I thought nothing of it until they were shut down for over-charging Blacks for the drinks in that restaurant.  I have decided to proceed with eating at home as much as possible because based on my experience I do believe some of the restaurants have a Black issue.  And by the way does 131 Main have Black waittresses that are brown or noticeably Black?"}
{"text":"131 offers a great atmosphere with terrific food. The wedge salad is amazing when tomatoes are in season and if you have never tried a thia noodle salad with beef try one here! One more aspect of 131's allure is their 1/2 priced wine night on Wednesdays. I can't say enough about 131 great lunch, great dinner, great brunch, and great service."}
{"text":"Is this a Houston's/ Hillstone copycat or what?  I lived right next to a Houston's in Southern California for several years, and was there 3 nights a week.  Almost identical menu, decor, and service pattern.  Eating at 131 Main was like a trip back home.    Being a recent Charlotte transplant I have been looking for that consistent contemporary American restaurant that the wife and I can always fall back on for those on the whim date nights.  Houston's and Hillstone was that for us back home, so let's see if 131 Main can fill that void we having been looking for in Charlotte.    For this first visit we went in for an early dinner, 5:30 or so.   Service started off slow, I could see the servers in pre-shift with only the bartender as our server.  But once there was help, we were able to get our drinks refilled and apps ordered.  +2.    From there on it seemed like a typical Houston's experience.  Apps, salads, and entrees tasted great, but not quite as much attention to detail as Houston's.  +1  But it was well spaced and paced; not as rushed as Houston's, where your entrees can come out half way into your salad.  +2  All said, 3 cocktails, two apps, two salads, ribs, filet, and dessert to take home all for around $125.  A lot cheaper than Houston's in Calufornia. +3  I think we might have found our next regular spot.  Will update again in a couple months."}
{"text":"Decided to come and try again better but still not as good as everyone raves. We had a group and service overall was good. Didn't have to wait and server was on us. Deviled eggs were pretty good as well as pimento cheese. Corn bread I thought was ok nothing special. For my meal I got the prime rib sandwich since they don't serve regular prime rib during the week. Another disappointment if that's your special item. Got to be honest the sandwich was terrible, so much bread and the prime rib didn't have much flavor which the cheese really have it all the taste. Super underwhelmed by it. Horsy sauce was also bland, wish it had a little spice to you. After two tries I don't see myself coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic! We arrived early for our reservation and sat at the bar. The bar is reasonably priced but I felt like they've neglected their tap selection. The room is dark, intimate, and elegant.  The dinner was well timed, staff was attentive. My wife loved her crab cakes, great lumps of crab meet and the mustard was good. Only topped by her raving adoration for the corn bread and honey appetizer. My shrimp and grits were so-so. It came with eight shrimp bit the grits were no match in Charlotte for many other establishments.   Overall, very pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at 131 Main. The customer service was unbelievable...I can't understand why others have dinged them on that measure.  We dined during Queen's Feast and felt like royalty.  The menu was explained well, we received a complimentary cornbread (OMG that was good!) as we were first time diners, and the wait staff was patient and flexible.  I have to say it is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  And oh yeah, the food was great.  I had the ribs with loaded mashed potatoes and my partner had a steak and fries.  We each had soup as an appetizer and finished with their amazing strawberry shortcake.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good, slightly overpriced but excellent staff and service. We enjoyed. Cornbread app was amazing."}
{"text":"Update, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner several weeks ago. He ordered the meatloaf and I got the shrimp and grits. The food took a little while, but they were pretty business as this was a weekend night. Out server was friendly and on point. And both of our meals were fantastic. I haven't been back for lunch, but I will definitely come back for dinner (and order the meatloaf this time)."}
{"text":"131 Main is outstanding!  The food is always fantastic, the wait staff is wonderful and they have a great selection of wine!  Tuesday night they have 1/2 price for a bottle of wine and Sun-Thu $5 appetizers.  I LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the third time with my co-workers. The food was fantastic as usual. I had the mahi sandwich. The fish was perfectly cooked. I would recommend the corn bread appetizer. Great place and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on the suggestion of someone in a local accessories store who gave me a \"free appetizer\" card. She suggested the smoked salmon app and it was delicious!!! It was moist and tender and smoky and glistening with that salmony richness. It came with toast points and a really nice aioli. Yummo!! Big piece, too!  I actually could've had that for lunch with a couple glasses of wine and would've been perfect. But I just didn't want to order that since it was free.  I didnt wanna look like a cheap ass. So I would've the crabcakes that came on top of greens with a creamy mustard sauce and that was delicious too!! The crabcake was big and full of lumps of delicious white crabmeat in the mix green salad was a nice size and had a delicious vinaigrette on it. I got roped into desert by the waitress and I was a little disappointed with that. It was a banana cream pie but it didn't taste like it was real banana cream it tasted like that custard sweet stuff and the whip cream was definitely not real whip cream. It might've been a mixture of whip cream and something else just to hold it so it doesn't dissolve and fall and lose all the air. There was however a very loud customer that was sitting with other people and she was never told to shut her giant hyena laughing ass up. It was very distracting and annoying and I can't even believe that the restaurant tolerated that without going over to her and telling her to tone that shit down. If it had been dinner and this was not addressed I would've gone over to the manager and told him how disappointed I was. Overall however I definitely would go back again and try what's on the dinner menu. Next time I'll be hoping the hyena doesn't show up again"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to 131 and I was blown away. The food was phenomenal. I had the salmon on a cedar plank and I couldn't stop raving about it. It was cooked to perfection and the seasonings they used on it were just amazing. My boyfriend got the NC rainbow trout and it was equally amazing. I have been craving the food ever since I left. Soo good. And the service was great as well. Our waitress was very sweet and personable and just genuinely kind. It was a little pricy but so worth the money. I would defiantly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed here! It's great for a work celebration and a date night as well. The shrimp and grits are well prepared and so is the salmon. Salads at lunch are pretty spot on too."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place, service and atmosphere are always is pleasant and the food has never let us down. The dishes are creative but familiar and they're always willing to accommodate whatever requests we make. Some restaurants give you the feeling they're just going through the motions and cranking it out night after night, but not this one. I always feel they're making an extra effort."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have no complaints. I typically get a salad (Thai steak salad, I think????) and love it! My boyfriend loves the prime rib. Entrees can be pricy but are always delicious.   Recently we went for happy hour and enjoyed a half priced bottle of wine and the cornbread for $7. It was a great deal! I think it's only from 5-7 pm on certain days and you must sit at the bar.   People around us had the double dip but I was somewhat turned off by the fact that all of the dips were cold (can a girl get some hot spinach artichoke dip?!). That being said, maybe I will give it a whirl one day."}
{"text":"Banana Cream Pie - That is the most important item you need to know about this place! I am completely obsessed with it now and will judge every other banana cream pie in my life to the one served here at 131 main. The graham crust has a cinnamon  and the bananas a pie are topped with a wonderful caramel sauce. Tons of whip cream to balance the sweetness. What can I just survive eating this the rest of my life?   My night did not start off with dessert as it may appear, I did come into this restaurant with the intention to be healthy and ordered the cob salad. The salad was so delicious. They topped it with grilled chicken, onion, tomato, avocado and the blue cheese vinaigrette. I also ordered a side of their garlic cream sauce to pair with my healthy side order of string cut french fries. As you can tell the diet isn't work out well.   Everything I had here was delicious and the service was spectacular. Our waiter was very attentive and had a great humor. Can't wait to come back when i'm not on a diet ;)  Order the jalapeno cornbread appetizer and drizzle with honey...YUMMM... Gosh I am out of control!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with 131 main. Very romantic but acceptable for a business meeting as well. I personally love the ribeye marinated in soy and pineapple. Def to die for."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an outstanding anniversary dinner at 131 main last night.  I had the ribs and she had the salmon.  Both were exceptional.  I highly recommend the outside porch."}
{"text":"Always good, always dependable.  The veggie burger is the best ever.  Frys are thin, crisp, and delicious.  Really good kale salad."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with family ...this is one of our regular lunch spots, but I am finally getting around to writing the review (YAY! Wifi!!). I have never been disappointed with any of the food. However on occasion I am disappointed with their choices, such as taking my favorite menu item, the tuna burger, off the menu quite some time ago, and not having the prime rib sandwich special on the menu as a regular item ( I will touch on this gem in a moment)...but this is beside the point... On this trip we had the large double dip (chips with guac and pimento cheese..eat them both on the same chip for double deliciousness), the grilled artichokes, the soup of the day which was mushroom and artichoke and the lunch special which was a prime rib sandwich. Then we went splitsies. The double dip is always scrumptious and the grilled artichokes are so good that it makes all the little charred bits that get stuck in your teeth afterwards worth while. The soup was very flavorful (is that sage I taste?) but a little on the thick side which only hampers its visual appeal. Now this sandwich.....a 6 oz blackened and grilled prime rib (\" sold!\") topped with havarti (\"no way!\") and grilled mushrooms (\"MMMM!\") a smear of mayo and served with an au jus to dip it in (\"lady, you had me at blackened.\"). Feeling a little decadent and inspired we asked if they could throw some grilled mushrooms on that badboy. Affirmative. The table agreed it was one of the best sandwiches we have ever had. But this enjoyment was bittersweet....will I ever be able to have one again?! ONLY a special?! *sniff *sniff Ok so why only 4 stars after such a rave review? I think the prices are a bit steep for lunch. 18 bucks for the sandwich, and our other go to...the crab cake...$17 gets you a single crab cake and 1 side. It is one of the best crab cakes I've had so we tolerate the high price for culinary pleasure. Also the waitress (as others have mentioned) seemed a bit much on this trip.  I hate it when servers put on a voice for you, as if them talking all phony is going to make your experience better...it doesn't. But, she was attentive and nice and I've had normal speaking servers most of the other times I have been here so I will let it slide. Tip: Ask if they have grilled zucchini, its not on the menu, sometimes pops up as the vegetable of the day but they can usually make it anyways. So do yourself a favor. YUM."}
{"text":"Look, I don't take 5 star's lightly, but the meal, atmosphere, Server, Manager were all contributing factors. Our server last night was Steven who went over and beyond to make sure we had an incredible experience. The Manager, Kurt, was equally friendly checking on us. With 3 kids, its hard for the wife and I to get out, so when we do, we want something special. We have found our new spot. The quality of the food for the price was excellent. My wife had the Trout and I had a the special Wahoo with a butter Crab sauce. Unbelievable. Please also check out the cornbread side and the Key Lime Pie-Wow. Great job 131! We will see you again soon!  Jeff L"}
{"text":"131 Main - East Blvd, Charlotte NC -  I am sorry, but I just have to give 131 Main a 5 star in Dilworth. Honestly,  I have been in the F&B industry for 2 decades. These guys understand personal attention. From their Manager, Billy, to our Server, Nick, they all made our visit special. I brought my wife on our 11th Anniversary this past week and was greeted with a complimentary bottle of Champagne. My wife had the fish special, and I had the Prime Rib. Perfectly cooked, perfect marbling. Her fish was also cooked to perfection. Don't forget to order their cornbread, you will understand when you do. Our server Nick was very attentive as well as the rest of the staff with clearing any dirty dishes at once/full glasses, etc. We were also surprised that we were presented with an array of complimentary desserts to finish up our evening. Thank you 131 Main and the staff for making our evening special. Both my wife and I have had trouble determining which of your Charlotte locations are better, and we both feel we will have to visit them again soon to decide!! They will remain our \"go to location\" for evenings out. Their menu has so much to offer, you wont be disappointed! (For you professionals, I was very impressed with a side meeting room and private bar this location had to offer. Please consider 131 Main when you make your next business meeting.)  Jeff LeVine - Thank you again guys and see you soon!  Reasons for 5 star? Great service, Personal attention, Management Visit, Good Pricing for the excellent quality of food, Quick service, Greeted properly upon arrival for reservation, and I could go on!"}
{"text":"I believe my lunch at 131 Main can be summed up with one dish...the \"Awesome Roast Beef\" sandwich.   Atmosphere - Upscale, modern, brown, business meeting appropriate vibe, noisy, dimly lit, watch out for that first step into the dining area (accident waiting to happen)   Service - Attentive, informative, black linens for black pants...I like!     Food - After some prompting, I opted for the menu titled \"Awesome Roast Beef\" sandwich, which comes with a side of shoestring fries.  Forgoing the fries as my side (see my JJ's Red Hots review) I opted for an order of the grilled asparagus instead.    My entrée, the Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich, arrived with a minimal wait.  It was presented with an au jus and my substitution of grill asparagus.    Um, this sandwich was truly awesome.  The fancy cut, baguette style, bread was decent and held the sandwich together during repeated dunks into the salty au jus.  To be honest, I thought sandwich tasted fine without the au jus.  Maybe this was due to the smear of mayonnaise, which I normally avoid but did not mind in this instance.  In the sandwich was red, lean, juicy, and very tender roast beef.  While at $16 this was a pricy lunch, it was the best French Dip style sandwich that I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The side of grilled asparagus was good and contained a nice smoky flavor validating the authenticity of its grilled marks.  Overall - While I cannot see (i.e. afford) going here every week, 131 Main is a nice place to take coworkers or that special someone for your scheduled fancy meal.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Drink - Pearfection, Appetizer - Double Dip, Entree - The Ribeye, Dessert - Brownie Sundae...you need nothing else...side of Asparagus IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!!! Always great atmosphere..."}
{"text":"When we arrived at the restaurant there was no one, we waited for the waitress who was busy on her cell phone. My wife and I ordered salmon, my salmon smelled of burnt beef, sage very rare and was very over cooked. Our glasses of tea were never refilled, the attention of the waitress very bad. Everything has changed after remodeling or has a new owner. I do not recommend for a good dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and none of the snooty hoity-toity class.  This restaurant in so inviting and simply does things right.  I would have loved to give it 5 stars but I jsut wasn't wow'd by my Prime Rib and that made me a little bit bitter... I will explain and please read the whole review.  I really want you to give this place the old college try:  Drinks:   Mojito - 5 stars  Absolutely worth it and you should get it.    Service: Knowledgeable.. Kind.. Patient.. An all-around very pleasant process.    Food:   Deviled Eggs - 4 Stars.  I had to order this simply because it isn't something that you see on a menu everyday.  The only reason that I didnt like it was because it was a little heavy on the mayo.. I like more mustard based.   Cold Quinoa Salad - 5 stars.  Now this was gooooood. They diced up some cucumbers and peppers and lightly tossed it nicely with a cilantro lemon based dressing.  Not too strong and very refreshing. Prime Rib Special - 3 Stars.  I've heard so much about so many different things on this menu and I decided to be risky and go off the reservation.  I wasn't very impressed.  Too fatty for my liking and really other people's fish dishes (trout - salmon) more than my steak.  Shot and I missed.   Veggie Burger - 5 Stars.  Ummmmm yeah.  My wife pulls out an order like \"veggie burger\" at a steak joint... What beautiful fool I thought she was.  Turns out that she thought it was the best non \"moo'ing\" burger that she has ever had.  Who would have thunk??    Must try next time:  Cornbread (I heard it was delicious)  Enjoy!!!    -Ian M."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner one random Monday and I was neither over nor under wowed. Before going I called to make reservations, and first was told they didn't have anything available until and hour and 30 minutes after the time I requested. When I told them I didn't want to wait that late, I would find something else they made reservations for the time I requested. Once we arrived we were seated immediately, I noticed the restaurant was kind of empty so I was confused by the person taking reservations. After we were seated and placed our drink order, we were asked to move to another table because they reserved that table for a bigger party. It was 5 of us, we moved across the restaurant which was not only an inconvenience it was uncomfortable, with the other patrons watching. As for the food, we started with appetizers the queso cheese and guacamole was good, everyone enjoyed. My cocktail was good not too weak, and had a smooth taste. I took the waiters recommendation and ordered the catch of the day \"wild fish\" and 2 sides. Based on the price $36 the portions size for the  fish was ridiculous, there was only one filet. Being I didn't like the sides I ordered, I finished my fish really quick and was still hungry. My son ordered a kids meal cheeseburger, the burger was huge. It was fit for an adult he barely touched it. Now my companion order slow roasted chicken and enjoyed it along with the fries. I won't say this experience made it a definite no go, but 131 Main wouldn't be my 1st, 2nd nor 3rd choice. I'm not hard to please, however Based on the reviews, I expected a better experience."}
{"text":"I reserve 5 stars for an \"Extraordinary to Perfection\" type of experience.  131 Main came right in at my \"Very Good to Excellent\" level of service and quality and just short of a 5 due to parking and a less than attentive wait staff.  I put service first because service sets the tone for my meal and is really the kick off to a good rating on Yelp for me.  (the other levels being 3=Good to Very Good; 2 = Fair to Good; and 1= Poor to Fair).  I had the Fish Tacos and they were excellent.  I judge a restaurant by either this dish or Shrimp and Grits!  They advertise that the fish is a \"fresh catch of the day\" and since I can't tell by tasting I have to trust, it tasted fresh to me.  The fish was  grilled not breaded with a slight smoky flavor to it.  It was topped with pico de gallo and avocado (I ordered mine on the side for control) and served with a delicious guacamole and homemade tortilla chips.  My husband had the Metropolis salad which had shredded chicken, mixed greens, feta, avocado, corn, tomatoes, croutons, almonds and dates.  It was served with a Dijon dressing that had a bit of a tart kick to it which complimented the mixed greens and feta.  The salad was excellent, the chicken favorable and moist and everything very fresh.  We will go back.  May be wise to ask to not be seated in the bar area as we felt like we were bothering the waiter to ask for water, when we could find a waiter."}
{"text":"Stopped here while killing time, waiting to leave town.  I got the Metropolis salad and subbed hickory grilled salmon for the pulled chicken. It was completely exceptional. Healthy portion, generous helpings of corn, avocado, feta, and dates.  Dining partner got a prime rib sandwich with aus jus and fries. The fries were extra skinny, hand cuts, fried until crisp and delicious. He also ordered a 131 maniac cocktail that he felt was cloyingly sweet, and just okay.  The service and salad was a definite 5, the sandwich was a 4, and the cocktail was a 3.  The service was excellent, even at 3:30 pm.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing staff! Dawn was so attentive! Nick new the wines and George had absolutely trained his staff well! Amazing night and amazing food can't say enough! Best steak I've had in Charlotte! Make a reservation quick! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We are fans of the Blakney location but found this one to be on par or even better. We were looking for a place to eat with two kids and ended up trying this because of the menu selection. We love the artichoke appetizer. The atmosphere is very nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"It's fresh, service is excellent, not too many varieties which could be a bad thing for some but indicates quality. We go there almost weekly. It's that good."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the portions are huge, the wine is reasonably priced, what more can you ask for? It is sometimes a wait for a table, but my wife and I usually sit at the bar and dine with no wait and it is perfect. Get the chips and dip to start, the meatloaf never dissappoints, and the seafood is always a winner!"}
{"text":"I came, I saw, I conquered.  I left, I shrugged, I moved on.  In other words...I ate, it was okay, nothing memorable, not desperate to return.  We came during restaurant week.  No offense to 131 but this isn't the kind of place that should offer restaurant week.  I mean their average meal is under $20 so you really aren't getting a great deal by adding a small portioned appetizer or salad to the meal.  I know you get desert too but I probably wouldn't have ordered dessert ordinarily from here so bottom line...you may save $3 or $4 but not worth it in my opinion.    2 people from our party did order from the queens feast and so I was able to try to dip trio and it really was quite good.  The pimento cheese was good, guacamole was pretty good and the salsa was good.  Nice appetizer.  I ordered the veggie burger and I wasn't super impressed.  It was blood red/purple due to the beets which was just kind gross in and of itself.  It was falling apart and soggy.  The cheese melted on top was good but it just wasn't much of a burger.  It was like this mushy beet mush on a bun.  My side items were the quinoa and the ginger/Asian slaw.  Slaw was good, not great but the quinoa was dry and flavorless.  Another one of my dining partners ordered fries with their meal and they were shoestring fries, greasy and eh.  Thanks to queens feast we had two huge peanut butter pies at our table.  Again, I wasn't super impressed.  Very rich and not really peanut butter flavor...just like a cocoa peanut flavor.  Hard to explain but the abundance of whipped cream took over the whole thing anyway.   The service was decent for RW and even though she didn't know squat about the menu she was nice.    I don't know.  I didn't leave feel inspired.  It felt very \"chainy\" to me and I knew there was another location in Ballantyne but I didn't realize this was a full blown chain.  The menu options didn't blow me away neither did the prices.  I just find them to be OK.  Somewhere between a Harper's and a Long Horn."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant and even though it can be more expensive, it is well worth it. I've had their rainbow trout and their fish tacos multiple times. Their fish tacos are my favorite. It comes with amazing guacamole and salsa and the tacos themselves are amazing. Great service and though it can be busy at times, if you go before dinner on a non-holiday it's not busy at all."}
{"text":"We went this past Wednesday for our company's annual Christmas Dinner - Third year in a row we had chosen 131 Main but probably the last.  Partly due to location, partly due to wanting to do something different and partly due to service and quality of food for price offered.  Our waitress was exceptionally pleasant with a terrific personality.  But, she was also quite forgetful.  We had a party of 7 and my wife and I arrived about 20 minutes after the rest of the group due to traffic issues. Water had already been served to the other 5 folks.  When we ordered our drinks, we also requested water.  The water never came.  When I ordered a 2nd beer, the waitress forgot and I had to remind her.  When the entrees arrived, my order omitted the mashed potatoes so I had to ask her to bring.  Another member of our party requested bread for the table when the entrees were served.  The bread never came.  After we were done with dessert, I requested a box from another employee for the balance of our key lime pie.  (Very big piece by the way).  When our waitress came back, I told her I was waiting for a box.  She said \"I'm sure its on the way.\"  About 5-10 minutes later, she came back and I asked again for the box. This time, it came.  As to the food, most of our party was satisfied with their entrees.  One person ordered the ribeye and they commented - nothing special.  They actually said \"Outback has a better ribeye.\"  My wife had the shrimp and grits and loved it.  The apps ordered were cornbread and deviled eggs.  Both excellent.  Key Lime pie we shared was also very good and more than enough for two.  Our 16 year old got to enjoy the rest when we got home.  No manager stopped by the table to ask us about dinner/service.  In a restaurant like this, I am accustomed to a manager doing that.  If 131 reads this, I suggest you make that standard practice - especially for groups of our size.  As we left, the hosts at the front said nothing to us - no \"thanks for coming in\", no \"have a happy holiday\"..."}
{"text":"This was excellent - the ribs are amazing and so is the banana cream pie - but you must start with the double dip - just an awesome way to start the meal off!!!"}
{"text":"131 Main, a nice treat for my birthday dinner. After passing this location multiple times, and seeing the crowd, we had to check it out. We arrived on a Wednesday night at 6:55, without reservations, but luckily got one of the last tables in the dining room. Needless to say by 7:30 the entire restaurant was full and remained that way until we left, and I know why...the food is delicious!  I was told to try the grilled artichoke appetizer, OMG, amazing. The grilled flavor was too die for and the mayo dipping sauce is an added bonus. After the appetizer, we decided to share two entrees so we ordered the filet and crab cake special and the cedar planked salmon. The filet, cooked medium, was amazing! One of the best filets I have had in a long time. The crab cake was good, but I have another restaurant favorite so it didn't meet that one, but still good. The salmon was cooked to perfection, however, I did find one bone... I know it happens so I didn't worry and enjoyed it! The sides, mashed potatoes & broccoli all cooked perfectly. As for the dessert, we were full but the waitress expressed the fact it was my birthday and we had to enjoy something so we went with the warm brownie with ice cream. What can I say, another to die for item on the menu, a warm brownie, topped with peanuts, caramel, hot fudge and ice cream....a true dessert treat!  I cannot wait to get back, because the baby back ribs looked and smelled delicious, my next visit I will order!"}
{"text":"I, like so many others, were sad to see 131 Main close in Dilworth a few years ago. Since then I have missed them because I don't live near their other two locations. So, needless to say when I heard they were opening in Southpark I was thrilled!  After watching their progress, I was able to visit opening week and this new location does not disappoint. From the decor to service, everything was spectacular. The menu remains consistent with their other locations, with some amazing specials each day. Welcome to Southpark, I look forward to many more nights of amazing meals with you!"}
{"text":"I have been going to 131 for years and hate that I have not yet provided a review.  131 Main offers a great variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Being that I have been going for some time I have enjoyed a variety of items, but would love  to highlight just a few: Appetizers:  Skillet Cornbread, Grilled Artichokes served with a mayo aioli and the deviled eggs. Entrees: The seafood is great, trout and salmon.  I have also enjoyed a filet and crabcake spcecial one night.  The mashed potatoes aren't my favotie, love mine a little creamier, but they are good.   Desserts, the peanut butter cake, OMG!  Tonight I decided to try something new, the Tuna Salad.  Wow, was it delicious! Served with an amazing dressing and perfectly seared tuna.  They also serve a side of soy sauce for dipping which is an extra bonus. I live in the area and will definitely continue to visit 131 Main.  On a nice night the patio seating is also a nice option."}
{"text":"Amazing filet mignon!!!cuts Like butter. Had the mashed potatoes...yum! And had the brownie for desert: good, not great."}
{"text":"I am from Cornelius and have been dining at this restaurant ever since it opened. It seriously is the best restaurant in the Charlotte area for a good take on American Cuisine. The Ahi Tuna salad is to die for, great presentation and great dressing. The cedar plank salmon is out of this world and if you have enough room try the banana pie. Wow. The prices are similiar or a little more than a typical chain like Chilis, but ew who wants to eat at Chilis. This food is worth the money, the taste and the atmosphere. Their servers are trained very well and very professional. And their food is always fresh, no freezer! AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Went with wife for date night. Staff was very nice, super accommodating and happy to help. We had the Double Dip app - which is just suped-up pimento cheese and Guacamole with chips - but PERFECT.  I got the Meatloaf with summer squash and a side of Black Eyed-Peas, my wife got the Crab Cake Salad. The food couldn't have been better.   This isn't a 5 star type restaurant but we got great treatment and ate excellent food. Period."}
{"text":"This was our first time being here and lets just say we are impressed! Service was exceptional and the Manager even came by to check on how our experience was at 131. Nice atmosphere! MUST TRY in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here with my family in Charlotte several times for both lunch and dinner. Each time the service has been great and the food is consistently really good. If you're looking for an ice place for a meal with family, friends or date night, I would highly recommend 131 Main. I had the Cedar Plank Salmon with Rice Pilaf and it was phenomenal. The fish was cooked perfectly with a perfect seasoning. The pilaf was the perfect side dish. My wife had the veggie burger and it is amazing! We highly recommend both of these dishes but everything we've had here is really good!"}
{"text":"Twenty minute wait on a Monday night, seated in a very noisy area, wait staff simply handed us a menu without any conversation, moved to a quieter location, 3 different waiters, 2 out of 3 had the personality of a brick wall, acted as if we were inconveniencing them.  Food was good.  Fire the waiters with the attitude."}
{"text":"Only came for apps and beer / wine.  Loved the ambiance.  Great service.  Get the grilled artichokes!  They were great!  My Aunt (who has a great pallet and is  world traveler) is a local and loves this place."}
{"text":"Can't imagine why this place gets good reviews!   Food is ordinary at best, selection of food is very limited and prices are high!!!!  We asked for bread while we waited for the food, and they brought out rolls that they cut in half and threw under broiler for one sec.....it was awful.....I really want to like this place.....we keep going back every now and then, but tonight will definitely be our last time...."}
{"text":"The restaurant has been completely redone after a major fire last year.  The environment is warmed by the wood surrounding accents.  I really liked the ambiance even the darkness because the table lighting was adequate to read the menu.  We visited during restaurant week and both selected items from the special menu.  It included a glass of wine, appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Adding a bottle of wine (half off) and extra items, believe me, the $30 per person restaurant meal was long gone.  I enjoyed the salmon and the kale was seasoned to perfection!  I never knew kale could be so tasty.  I am going to try seasoning it a great deal at home (see photos).  Overall, it was a pleasant dinner and service by Zack was excellent.  I look forward to another visit to this 131 Main location (there is another location in Cornelius)."}
{"text":"I find 131 Main to offer something for everyone, the menu is unique and the appetizers are great, specifically the scallops and the smoked salmon. I recommend their salads and the \"Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich\" is aptly named. The only criticism I have is their beer selection since the took Grolsh off the menu."}
{"text":"very very good. All I want to say is I have this 20 min or so conversation with one of their waitress and she explained something to me that I would like to mention here. The reason that they sometimes run out of your favorite dishes is because the owner insisted on ordering just sufficient amount for the estimated client flow and do not wish to have any left over. That way, they can ensure that the quality of their dishes are almost made with the best and the freshest ingredients. I really appreciate this gesture and I can feel the freshness and the juiciness of my steak. The side veggie which most people don't care for, taste organic. The tea I had was Earl Grey, my favorite choice. Their brand is acceptable and smooth although not my favorite brand. The waiters/waitresses are also very knowledgeable and if they cannot help you with your questions (which happened to me in my last visit), the waiter directed another more senior waitress to assist me and I thought that was both necessary and very sincere in terms of providing the best response to my inquiry. The parking is plentiful - at least I have never had issues with finding a suitable parking space nearby. The desserts are good. I prefer sober and generally speaking, not the best sober but good enough to wrap up a nice meal. I usually sit in the side tall tables - not much of a view to the outside but you can catch people walking their dogs, strolling past and busy traffic. Generally I recommend 131 Main because their indigents are organic and quite fresh, their customer service is attentive and very professional, the outside scenery is acceptable, the lighting inside is soothing and well decorated. The dish presentation is clean and sleek. Their staff's uniform is well maintained. I look at the waiters and waitress' hands and they are also acceptable. Overall, I am satisfied and I will return to explore further at a later time."}
{"text":"I had a Christmas company lunch here today and had the best experience! The server and manager were very attentive and nice, it helps that there were only a handful of patrons sharing the staff. I noticed seating near the entrance was very well lit up but the seating in the back was a little dark, just FYI.   We were seated right away and our waters were always topped off. We ordered the heavenly jalapeno cornbread skillet, which we also determined was effectively crack. The honey that comes with the skillet is a delightful sweet twist. I ordered the ahi tuna salad while most of the others at my table got the cheeseburger. It took a little for the food to come out but it was definitely worth the wait. The ahi tuna salad was out of this world! The tuna was seasoned perfectly and had a great sear. The ginger dressing was soooo good. I did get a crazy amount of pickled ginger, there is no way someone could eat that much ginger in one sitting. The best part is I left satisfied and full after eating a salad, rare in my case, I'm very critical of rabbit food. I actually could even finish it, I was too stuffed.   I will be coming back for the ahi tuna salad and the cornbread skillet, possibly during Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"131 Main never disappoints.  Excellent service, and every meal was delicious.  This is even more impressive since it was during Queen's Feast.  Let's face it, the chaos of Queen's Feast usually results in poorer service and rushed meal prep.  If the experience is good during this week, then normal weeks will be phenomenal.   Cedar plank salmon was some of the best I've had anywhere.   Crab cake salad was awesome as well.  QF selection desserts were excellent - and ginormous!   Overall great dinner at a great value."}
{"text":"Really good food options with pretty straight forward menu.  First the wine by the glass was FABULOUS and only $8.   They keep it simple with one Cab option.   Had shrimp and grits.   A little heavy for a full meal but tasty.   Ribs for my niece which she loved and she's a very thin 11 year old.  My friend had filet special.  Two medallions. One over cooked and the other perfect.  Prize was banana cream pie.  Not even a dessert fan and this is a signature dish you must try!   I'm now stuffed and dying."}
{"text":"So back on black Friday I went to 131 Main and had a bad experience. Mr. D, the owner, reached out immediately to rectify my dining experience. I responded to Mr D and gave him all my contact information and the best ways to reach me.   Well, the GM Mr. Mel Funk was to reach out to me... I got a text \"131 main visit\"  on 11/29 -- what? Okay no introduction, just 131 main... Mr. Funk must be a very busy man.   I text back \"I am available all day tomorrow. Thank you.\"  Mr. Funk \"is this the Dr.\"  What? Are you kidding me? You have more than one complaint and you can't keep your text's straight.   Me: \"No this is Claudine from Yelp-I visited your restaurant on blk friday\"  Mr Funk: \"I will be here after 10\"  Now what the hell does that mean? That I should call him, go see him, text him... what does that mean exactly? Well that was 12/9 -- it's now 12/25 and I have never heard back from him or the owner. I feel as though since I was the one that had the bad experience, I should have to be the one that chases a GM. The owner tried to do good, but the GM failed miserably... guess he has way to many complaints to deal with than mine.   Horrible follow through and shows me a lack of concern about people and their time.   What a joke."}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time during restaurant week with a couple of girlfriends. We chose this place because their restaurant week menu had great options besides just steak or fish. For our first course I chose deviled eggs and my girlfriend chose the cornbread. Both were VERY good. The cornbread even came with honey to drizzle on top. It also came to the table in a mini cast iron skillet which kept it warm. For the main course I chose the steak that came with fries. It was a good size and cooked to my liking. Last but not least for dessert, I had key lime pie. It was just right. Not too sweet and not to tart. Overall, I love this place and will be back soon.  The staff was amazing and patient with all my questions."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner twice.  It has a nice atmosphere and overall we had a great food, drink, and service experience.  This will be a new staple for me.  Food: Please do yourself a favor and order the Cast Iron Cornbread...just do it.  No butter/honey needed.  It is more like a dessert, but if you just order this and a couple of drinks, you would be satisfied with your experience.  For dinner we had the Filet Medallions (good as expected) and the Slow Roasted Chicken.  The Slow Roasted Chicken was great.  The glaze on it was delicious and was my favorite entree.  Dessert was not a disappointment either.  The PB Pie was massive and just had tons of good stuff going on in it.  PB, whipped cream, chocolate, etc.  Drinks: All the drinks were good, but the mojito was memorable for me.  Tastes great and is stronger than expected.  Service: We have had great servers/service both time.  Completely satsfied."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Love the Ahi Tuna Salad.   Deviled Eggs.  Skillet Cornbread.  Shrimp and Grits. Monday through Thursday special happy hour pricing.    This restaurant is always busy which gives you the thumbs up for happy customers.   A frequent happy customer."}
{"text":"The food was great, the people very nice, accommodating, and make you feel right at home. We usually go to a new restaurant when we read the reviews and I agree with all the other reviewers that this was nothing less than 4 stars. They have what I would have to call a 'romance package' with two entrees, bottle of wine and dessert. This is a place we've been before and we will surely go again."}
{"text":"Food: we had the cornbread for an appetizer. They serve it with honey that you can drizzle over the bread and it is delicious. Prepared in a cast iron which puts a good crust on it. Fish tacos were the entree served with guacamole and chips. The tacos were delicious. Slightly spicy.   Service: very polite, but they forgot our cornbread. We had t remind them and it didn't make it out until after our entrees were served.  Atmosphere: very comfortable. Casual yet professional. Ideal for business lunch or a dinner out.  Miscellaneous: This place only uses its freezers for their ice cream so you're eating fresh and it's priced right. I'd definitely go back. I just hope the servers bring their A game next time."}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Don't believe the hype!   A five star wanna be.  A two star reality."}
{"text":"Tonight was our 3rd experience here at 131 Main Blakeney and I must say that each experience gets better and better.   Upon arriving tonight the bartender, Andrea, remembered our drink order and promptly made it. Granted it's only been 2 days, but still remembering our drinks with the volume they do is pretty remarkable. So, as we enjoyed our cocktails, Andrea and Jordan scoped us out a seat at the bar so we could join them for dinner.  We returned tonight because of our amazing experience Wednesday evening. On that trip we sat in the main dining room after having drinks at the bar. In the dining room, Ben was our server. He was top notch. He had great recommendations and delivered the menu beautifully. I could see why he was training a young lady that evening. On that evening, we enjoyed a fresh fish feature in which Ben described phenomenally. The chef really outdid himself with this feature. It was very tasty.   Also throughout our experience Wednesday and this evening we witnessed \"team service\" at its best. Between the two of us we have close to 40 years of experience in the industry, so I believe we have the expertise to acknowledge when a place/staff is doing it right and when it's off... I do have to say that this place is spot on.   So, back to this evening. We decided to go into 131 Main because we were in the area running errands and wanted a drink/quick bite. We decided to eat at the bar because we felt a bit underdressed for their dining room on a Friday night. Upon walking in, again, we were instantly welcomed by Andrea, who also remembered our drinks. Upon sitting at the end of the bar, we had a wonderful seared artichoke app. I highly recommend. For entrees my wife had the smoke salmon app and I had a red snapper (blackened upon Andreas recommendation) and grits which was out of this world. This was another chef feature. (I recommend asking the features upon any visit.) After enjoying our dinners, we were interested in after dinner/dessert drinks. This is where Jordan came in and stole the show. Now we aren't too big on sweet/dessert drinks, but on an a rare occasion they can be nice. Tonight my wife wanted a dessert martini and man did Jordan deliver. He made a signature cookies and cream martini which blew her socks off. It was tasty. Hell she had 2. That's the biggest complement.   Again this evening we experienced the \"team service\" atmosphere. That makes any establishment run smoother and makes any guest have a better experience. This place does it well. The service manager, Nick, has this staff working well.   With a great front of the house staff paired with a well executed menu this place is the tops. They've got lifelong regulars with us now. We'll see you there..."}
{"text":"I ended up at 131 Main for a Company paid dinner with my coworkers. I'll be honest, previous to this I hadn't been too excited to try them because their menu didn't look that appealing to me. I'd saw a lot of reviews about the cornbread so I brought that up when we discussed appetizers. The cornbread was pretty good. It was definitely not your mommas! Very different, but still decent. They have honey on the table to eat with it which enhanced the flavor in my opinion. I doubt i'd order it again. I ordered the potato soup & the Big Island Ribeye and both MORE THAN made up for what was lacking in the cornbread. That was probably the best Potato Soup and Ribeye that i'd ever tasted. The potato soup was enhanced from your typical potato soup. I wanted more! And with the ribeye the marinade was not too think. And you could taste the marinade through the steak. It was tender and just excited my palate. I literally can not wait to return and order it again. Service was also awesome. Our server was friendly, quick and attentive. The ambience was nice and relaxed. Walking in was a bit weird. I didn't know which was the main door but I figured it out. This definitely wasn't the type of place that i'd be comfortable walking in with Jeans and a T-Shirt on. It was a bit stiff. But all that really matter is the food and that will be the reason why I return."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed dinner here with a date for a romantic evening. I hoped it would be a little more cozy and intimate and a little more formal, but I like the reasonable prices.  A better steak then the Capital Grill and half the price.  My date has severe medical dietary restrictions, so I called ahead to ask about their menu and the receptionist said the server would have information available when we arrived.  I made an appointment the evening before for 6:45 and then I changed it to 8 with no problem. (The Masserati parked out front with a dealer decal on the door is tacky, but the rest isn't snooty or haughty at all.)  We arrived at 8:05 and were seated immediately.  There were only two people waiting in the lobby and the dining room was not full, and this was Saturday night. We were seated at a table for two across from each other and it would have been nice to be side by side.  Also, the noise level is a bit much; it wouldn't hurt if they put up some drapes to reduce the din.  The server delivered menus quickly and returned to take our order quite soon.  I had the steak with pinapple glaze which was epic, and I've lived in Kansas so I know a good steak and I've lived in Hawaii so I know pineapples too.  I like my steak done, not mooing, and ordered it medium-well and that is just what I got not some burnt outside raw inside piece of charcoal from a cook too full of himself.  But enough about me.  My date explained her restrictions to our server and he explained what the kitchen could do to accommodate her and even checked with the kitchen and returned quickly with an answer.  My date completely enjoyed her meal as well by the look of her plate when done.  If you are looking for a nice restaurant in Ballantyne, look no further.  I originally looked up 131 Main based on a recommendation from a hotel clerk, and she deserves my thanks for the suggestion.  (If you're wondering, celiac and lactose intolerant. No digestion distress following dinner.)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for dinner and drinks after getting engaged.  The staff didn't even know it was a special night for us and we were still treated like VIPs.  They offer a gluten-free menu, and everything we ordered was cooked to perfection.  We liked this place so much that when we wanted to take friends out this week we chose the Dilworth location because we had such a good experience here.  Additionally, I would highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks with friends on a Monday night.  The food was good the and the valet was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"All in all a great place to have dinner and drinks. The inside is very intimate and cozy. My husband took me here for Mother's Day dinner. The Hostess staff was unfriendly and it took 10 min of my husband standing there before anyone acknowledged him. He made a reservation for 7:30pm and we arrived a little early so we expected to wait but not to be ignored before being greeted. The job of a hostess is to set the stage and be inviting; which they were not. The young lady who sat us seemed unhappy and should not have been working due to her poor attitude. Our waitress was Kristen and she was very nice. Our drinks from the bar were excellent. You could taste the alcohol and it was not watered down. We had the blueberry mule and peachy daly. Food was great. You could tell everything was fresh. Got the soup of the day and crab cakes. I ordered the scallops originally but they ran out so crab cakes were the second choice and it did not disappoint. Desert was good as well we had the brownie and it was good. It did come with nuts which I liked and it was like warm which didn't melt the ice cream too much which I loved. This is a nice place and I will be back especially for the drinks and food.  I am giving them a 4 bc of the horrible hostess service."}
{"text":"Overall a good place for a reasonably priced (overall) meal.  The decor is great, lots of wood, booths, glass to separate sections of the restaurant, big booths in the front, nice foyer entrance, etc.  It has a nice buzz and appeal.  The bar is big and looked like a fun place to hang out, but we were there for dinner.  The food was good - I got the plank salmon and a house salad - really like the salad, it was crisp and fresh and loved the cornbread croutons.  The salmon was good although slightly undercooked.  The rice mix that came with it was okay; a little too funky for me (I like rice, but some stuff they added was not to my liking)  Others I dined with got steaks (very good) and ribs (excellent).  The ribs really looked awesome, served with thin french fries and filled up the plate.  The servings were good but not huge.  The waiter was okay, he was a little slow to refill water and bring our check.  It did not seem that busy so I am not sure what was going on.  It did not take away from the meal. Good selection of beer and wine as well  Overall, an enjoyable place to go!"}
