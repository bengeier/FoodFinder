{"text":"From the moment our party stepped into the restaurant we were greeted with kindness and concern. The hostess asked if we required any special menus due to dietary restrictions. Unbeknownst, we were a group of allergy parents and providers. We were provided with a gluten sensitive menu and our waitress explained the paleo, vegetarian and allergy menu selections. As well, when we mentioned allergies, a manager came over to explain their policies on allergy accommodations . All of us were pleasantly surprised to learn Burton's has dedicated fryers, no peanuts in the restaurant, all allergy friendly meals are plated on square plates and delivered to the table by the manager, colored plates based on type of food ordered and the list goes on. It was a relaxing and accommodating environment. Highly recommend Burton's for those with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"OMG......this was a awesome treat...thanks to my wife Georgia for bringing me after the concert.  Lunch was simple yet prepared great.  The manager (Mark) was extremely pleasant and carried on a small conversation during lunch.  The  Buffalo Chicken dip is very very good and the sandwiches we had were extremely tasty.

Next time we are in Charlotte this is the clear dinner choice!

Thanks for a Great lunch Burtons grill......our compliments to the chefs in the kitchen, they did an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this restaurant. The owner has created a great and safe place to eat if you have allergies. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I'd recommend this restaurant for a date night, anniversary dinner, or just simply a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Still a stellar bar and grill with great staff who clearly are focused on you. Very good food, modified if desired to respond to your allergies."}
{"text":"I've gone 4/5 times in the last month. I love that they have a reward system. Now on the downside I was just there on 1/30/17 and enjoyed my salmon burger and shrimp, returning on 2/4/17 with my family of 10 telling everybody to order the shrimp and salmon burger only to find out that it has been discontinue. We were very disappointed but enjoyed everything. They serve the BEST Sanmohoto ever. (its a sangria) I suggest reservation on weekends especially if you have a large party. I love how MadPark area are getting nicer restaurant and affordable."}
{"text":"After dining at Burton's, I had no choice but to question the longevity of such an establishment. To start, the prices are ridiculous for the fare served. I paid upwards of $17 for a short rib grilled cheese with fries, which, while tasty, was not particularly deserving of its price tag. 
The service was poor, after waiting for 15 minutes in a visibly empty restaurant, someone finally noticed us. Although our server was friendly, my order was messed up, which was frustrating, especially with the price I paid. $17 will take you a lot farther at nearby Rocksalt or Viva Chicken, I have my doubts that Burtons can survive another year with its current quality in such a competitive market and expensive location."}
{"text":"I'll go ahead and start out with this, \"the absolute best restaurant on the face of the planet.\" It's that kind of place where you're comfortable dressed to the t's or just casual... our server was James, he made sure we were well taken care of and answered promptly and very descriptively on any questions we had about the menu, as well as conversing with us about our upcoming wedding, he just made us feel at home... and his suggestions were on point! Honestly the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ... and that's having been in the restaurant industry for 10+ years. On top of that we went there on Valentine's Day, which between that and Mother's Day is the busiest night of the year, and you usually expect the quality of service and food to drop a little due to the crowd... not in this case, we both had the catch of the day (mahi mahi) over a bed of mushroom risotto, the best piece of fish(and/or meal, the risotto  complimented the fish very well) I've ever had, and I lived on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico for 2 years... this topped them all... between the service, food, and atmosphere on a five star rating.... this place gets fifteen stars!!!!  PS..I had the minestrone as an app, it was also ridiculous... this place is killing it on all levels!!! Would strongly recommend to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful comfortable restaurant with outdoor seating.

Service, however needs some additional training.  Staff was not friendly on a Saturday afternoon and perhaps because I was dining alone sat me in the back without asking my seating preference as the place was very open because I didn't arrive until after 1:30."}
{"text":"They were so incredibly accommodating about my crazy food restrictions. Our entire group loved their meals and I left feeling great and well fed.  It's sort of a miracle for me to have found a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty nice, a little on the dark cozy side. The prices are high. Lots of local beers to choose from. Unfortunately, our waiter didn't know much about the wines :( But I would go back."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant and were disappointed, the food taste and quality was that of average cafeteria food. Dinner took 3 hours from the time we arrived, with a reservation, to the time we left. Which was OK, we were enjoying the nice atmosphere. We ordered appetizers, shrimp, calamari, and buffalo chicken dip. The shrimp was good but the others, not so much. Three people in our party had the short rib, which tasted like average pot roast and the brussel sprouts were bland and undercooked. One had the ruben which was cold, soggy bread, no sauerkraut, and not very tasty. Our food came out at different times. With all the places to eat in Charlotte you must have good food to keep people coming back."}
{"text":"We had a lot of new guests at our table and they all enjoyed it.  Food was really well prepared and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  I like the wide variety of options for food choices and all of them have been great so far!

I always recommend this place for people to visit - its will be a staple in our places to go out to eat!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! They have a great variety to choose from, but not so big that you are overwhelmed. The servers were great, they were helping each other and working together to get food out very quickly. The bar was moving a little slow, probably due to volume, or not enough bar tenders, but the drinks were done well. Love the atmosphere, very cozy. The products are a bit pricey, but for the quality of service, cleanliness, and food you recieve, its worth it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambiance was there, but I'm sad to say it was very disappointing. We love the area and had high hopes for the \"new place\". The she-crab soup had a nice flavor but it was very runny (the consistency of a broth). And there was no crabmeat in the soup at all, just pure liquid. My husband got a NY strip which was over-cooked to medium + (he ordered medium rare). The steak also lacked seasoning, he actually had to salt and pepper it himself at the table. My burger was also over-cooked and lacked flavor. This is probably a positive for the food-sensitive crowd, but I didn't sense any salt/pepper in general as even the onion rings lacked the most basic seasoning. Our server Hannah was extremely attentive and friendly but could not make up for the over-priced experience. It has a cool bar and good drink menu."}
{"text":"Was an awesome dinning pleasure. From the greeting at check-in till we exited.  Amanda our waitress was so perfect. Meals and kitchen staff excellent care in preparation and presentation.  Family loved it and planning to be back soon."}
{"text":"Great time with friends. Our dinner was delicious, and our service was super. Thanks to Drew for taking good care of us! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  I got the crab cakes with cole slaw and broccoli.  Our server Tonika was wonderful.  Everyone else at the table really like what they ordered.  Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"We were really excited for a new restaurant in a neighborhood that desperately needs more quality places to eat. Our hopes were high. The space is cool, menu looks great on paper and service was good; however, the food was extremely disappointing in every way. It's confusing how you can botch such a simple menu and offer tasteless, bland food. Tuna was off, fillet had no flavor and looked boiled, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were really bad. The food at comparable places like 131 Main or Bricktops blow theirs away. Wish I could report differently but nothing redeeming about the food here. Assume the positive reviews were paid for or from patrons with low expectations. Hope they fix ASAP or their future is bleak."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most rude staff at the front check in station I have ever encountered. Quotes 20 min wait and after we inquired after 30 minutes we were told we told you 45. They had multiple open tables that they were \"holding\" for reservations. The only bright spot was our server once seated and the food. I will not be back as the food does not outweigh the horrible treatment by staff. RUN AWAY!!!!  These people think the customer is here to serve them!  SAD."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first and probably last time. We had the General Tso's cauliflower which was really good but extremely overpriced. We ordered the veggie burger and plain fries. The burger was lifeless and lacked character. There was nothing to distinguish it at all. The fries had no luster and we left them on the plate. The wine list was average at best. Good service from the bartender."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that they cater the entire menu to dietary allergies and restrictions...#AbFab!! The environment was classy-casual and would be a cute spot for date night. The food was AHHHHMAZING! We had the General Two Cauliflower (I'm stealing the recipe to take back to every Asian Cuisine feign) and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. The latter was also quite delicious...I would steal that recipe but it would probably take too long to make that unctuous short rib!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Let's start with our waiter Joshua. Loved his personality. Impeccable service. He told us about the Whim appetizers featured. We had the sweet potato gnocchi. It had a sauce we couldn't let go to waste so we got some bread to sop it up. Grilled bread, wow. Next to the salads, delicious, we tried the roasted beet salad and the Cobb minus the egg. Both very good and bigger than expected. Entrees were filet mignon with crab cake, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was lightly seasoned with lemon butter. The other entree was a bronzed salmon paleo which melted in your mouth. We had to get dessert to go since we couldn't eat another bite, served in the cutest little mason jars. We also ordered a bottle of wine which is half off on Wednesdays and you can take the unfinished bottle home with you. A very good lunch of leftovers will be had the next day. Definitely a keeper of a place."}
{"text":"It is always daunting to eat out as a family with food allergies. Burtons Grill and Bar can certainly be classified as allergy aware and allergy friendly. Burtons has a dedicated fryer and their regular fries are cut in house. The management was very helpful and allergy aware. The manger brings out any allergy order on a designated square plate. Any order with seafood will be brought out on a blue plate. There are no peanuts in the building at all. All of this certainly adds up to a great allergy friendly experience. It is so nice to have in the area which is so very accommodating. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon.  Generous portion. Wonderful sauce. Perfectly cooked.  Atmosphere is delightful.  What a nice addition to Park Road."}
{"text":"Had lunch early on a Saturday. Good service and the food was also good. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for Valentine's Day dinner.  The NY Strip was really good but the califlower appetizer was even better.  Danielle waited on us and was one of the friendliest servers we've ever had.  I think I've found my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been checking out this area of town a lot lately since it seems to be full of new restaurants and hangouts. Burtons is huge and has a great atmosphere to hang out and have drinks! The food was very good as well and we will definitely be back again. If your looking for something cheap this isn't the place for you, but you get what you pay for and it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. They have a gluten free menu & they offer a burger with a lettuce bun option & broccoli instead of fries!!! I got the house salad with steak and it was phenomenal. For less healthy option, they have the best Rueben in Charlotte!!!! Cool beers on tap."}
{"text":"We ordered the crab crusted haddock, salmon and the burger, all were excellent - everyone was very pleased.  I'm a very picky restaurant goer, and typically underwhelmed - but Burton's is a great atmosphere, really good food and attentive staff.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This was our first trip and we weren't disappointed. Our waitstaff person Michelle was knowledgeable about the wine with a good recommendation and the various meals. We had the appetizer special grilled avocado stuffed with crab meat, quinoa and some sour cream it was great. We had 2 different salmon dishes one was salad with grilled salmon mine was bronzed salmon which is a lighter version of blacken with veggies. Both were cooked to order and delicious. 
Nice outdoor covered patio add good food, good wine and great service made for an enjoyable time. We will be going back again. 
Charles"}
{"text":"Burtons never disappoints!  We made a reservation and were seated a bit early, which is always nice.  The food was amazing...highly recommend the short ribs and the street tacos (bronzed fish).  Great atmosphere and great wait staff!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"I shouldn't give Burton's such a high rating, because that will make it busier and I'll have a hard time getting a table.  But Burton's is absolutely wonderful!

The setting is not all that special -- though the patio is among the nicest in Charlotte -- but the food, oh the food, is wonderful.  Of all the choices among eight people on two nights, only one things (brussels sprouts!) was less than wonderfully superb.

I especially recommend the Gen. Tso's cauliflower appetizer, if they have it that night, plus the crab cakes (best I ever have had) and the ribs.  Get mashed potatoes as one of your sides.  The onion rings are very, very thin and a relatively small order, but they are great too.

And the key lime pie meets all the standards for that dessert, short of getting it in the Keys.

(Oh, and if you are lucky, get Bobby as your waiter.)"}
{"text":"Met a friend for drinks and light snacks on Saturday night, it was my first visit. I sat down at the bar and joined my friend who already arrived, there was a bartender putting an order into a computer he looked at me and went back to putting his order in no \"hello\" or \"I'll be right with you\". He looked at me again then walked away without saying anything. Another bartender walked by and again said nothing, kind of odd as I had nothing in front of me,not even a menu and was looking him in the eye. After about 5 minutes the original bartender came over and asked me if I wanted anything, I asked for a menu as it was my first visit and had no idea what cocktails were available he gave me the menu and walked away, still no real greeting. 

We ended up splitting a couple of appetizers, we tried the calamari, philly rolls and the dry rubbed wings, all were great, especially the wings. I tried a few signature cocktails and enjoyed them as well, but the lack of welcoming service at a basically empty bar was disappointing.

It's so easy to make people feel welcome and it goes along way to making people want to come back in the future"}
{"text":"Our family had dinner there on Friday, March 17 at 6:45.  There were several families around us with very young children, yelling and running around. The restaurant was very loud and we couldn't have a conversation amongst.  My daughter ordered calimari as her entree and they brought it before everyone else's entrees, thinking it was her appetizer.  Once the other entrees were delivered, they didn't bring my husband's for another 10 min.  My daughter and I enjoyed our black bean burgers but my husband's burger was just o.k. ($15 burger!) and my daughter's calamari was not good at all.  Service was just o.k. too.  All around, a real disappointment."}
{"text":"Just kinda showed up here based on Yelp reviews and wasnt dissapointed. Nice vibe and look to the place when you get in. Didnt have a reservation on a friday night so got lucky as the place got busy after we were seated no wait at all!! Server was very knowledgeable of the menu even though its not a huge menu. Food was great overall! Philly cheesesteak egg rolls a must try! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, it has a great atmosphere and a well kept staff. The salmon was delicious. We had an angel by the name of Hannah as our waitress, she was incredible. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was good and came out fast. Not much could go wrong with the chicken Caesar salad that I ordered anyways but I still need to say that I have no complains there. My manager got the California chicken sandwich which she was very happy with. The waitress was fast and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burtons is firing on all cylinders despite only being open less than a month. Staff training and customer care show from the moment of arrival thorough-out our entire experience - well done. Aps of Firecracker shrimp and Fish tacos highlight super fresh seafood and expert preparation. Crab cakes as entre were top notch - My wife said her \"super-food\" salad was the best she's had in town. Fun to people watch, busy, buzzy, cool vibe and just the right level of attentiveness from JJ. Thanks for a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"We have been numerous times and I believe that makes us \"regulars\"!  I love the detail and variety of gluten free options - appetizers (fried cauliflower), entrees (GF fried fish sandwich) and dessert (cheesecake). !  I'd give it 5 stars, but it's a tick overpriced."}
{"text":"Had the best filet I ever had.  Loved the blue cheese sauce on it.  The entire meal was outstanding, and the server, Jacob, was excellent."}
{"text":"I am keeping my rate a 3 stars for my 2nd visit. My bf and decided to come here for our anniversary dinner. 

We were sat at a 4 top table on the back side of the restaurant. We could see the Winter Olympics on the tvs above the bar area. Casey came over and introuduced herself as being our server for the evening. She showed us the Whim menu. I assume these items are special non menu items that frequently change. She gave us time to explore the menus before we ordered.

My bf decided on the porkchop and I chose the half portion of the lobster shrimp pasta.

He enjoyed his food. He recieved his knife late so he ate his sides 1st. My food was ok. I had to flag Casey down to ask for a spoon to assist in twirling my pasta. Yes im old school; my jr high teacher taught me that. My food didn't really have any seasoning. The portion was a nice size, but I had an overwhelming feeling of that I wanted to vomit afterwards. I don't know if I was full or I just felt ill from a wierd aftertaste.

Casey came by one time to check on us. She offered dessert and we declined. She spent more time telling us about the rewards card than anything else. You get $25 off after you spend $300. I'm not sure if I would come back for full dinner. This may be a good spot for drinks and apps at the bar."}
{"text":"Review is for house salad,  best I have ever had, they are still new and working out some kinks, but they have a chance to be good, need to find a killer bar staff, that bar is good enough to have one"}
{"text":"Unbelievable menu choices.   I ordered the BBQUE sliders.   Fabulous!   Customers service over the top great!  Desserts were #1 as we indulged in bread pudding made with croissants:) 
Big big big salads with awesome outdoor patio!  Again can I say great customer service! 
Going back for lunch today as dinner was soooo good!
Cheeseburger toasted bun and all the condiments just perfect!  Also flat breads amazing good and party in ur mouth flavors!

Special brewed tea with cinnamon and honey!

Local SWEET POTATO CRANBERRY AN PECAN CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING!"}
{"text":"We were unable to be seated after waiting for 30 minutes. The girl at the front desk was rude, she has pink or red hair. We asked for a booth, and she was unable to give a time frame on the wait. I'm not sure how that's possible when you have a computer in front of you with information. Even an estimated time would've been great. But we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very trendy bar/restaurant. 

Upon arrival the GM (Vincent) amazing and quickly escorted us to our table. We did make reservations and  glad we did as the restaurant was packed. Not so packed you were miserable or people were waiting allover the restaurant but full. 

Our server was JJ who catered to every detail and really knew the menu and gave great suggestions. I hope when I go back we have her again as she really made the experience grand. 

Let's get down to the yummy food we had.
(We were a table of 4)

Appetizers: 

Philly Spring Rolls-

Definitely is full of meat and cheese in a spring roll. The rolls are served with a spicy ketchup which is perfect for a philly roll. Out of 4 of us only 1 didn't care for it... definitely try! 

Firecracker Shrimp :
Definitely Asian fusion added to this dish. Shrimps were huge and cooked to perfection. You get 5 but again they are HUGE. 

Main course:

Special- White fish (totally forgot the name) and a mushroom risotto - Absolutely amazing. The mushroom risotto was a major hit and all of our forks were diving in for a bite. Risotto cooked so perfect it melts in your mouth. 

Paleo Burger with Brussels sprouts-  Large portion and equally satisfying if your watching that waist line. The only complaint was with the brussel sprouts. She assumed they would have been cut smaller but this is a preference thing versus an issue. 

Short Ribs with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts: This dish came as one of the recommended and patron favorite. Definitely tender meat and would order again. Not as good as that mushroom and fish dish though. 

Crab Cake with french fires: Definitely full of actual lump cake versus fillers. The fries were garlic parmesan fries. My only complaint is the parmesan was at the bottom of the plate and not on the actual fries. Maybe I missed something there but none the less very good. 

I added a side of she crab soup with my entree and again mind blown. 

Rating:
Best: White Fish and risotto
2nd: Crab Cakes
3rd: Short Ribs
4th Paleo Burger 

Dessert:

We shared the cake/cheesecake samplers. They come in little mason jars packed with cake and icing. OMG..... heaven! Red Velvet ...enough said.

I have reservations coming up for restaurant week and can't wait to bring along several friends to try. 

Way to go Burton's!"}
{"text":"This was the best dinner I have had in a very long time. I have Celiac Disease and I was so excited when I got to sample some food from Burton's at the Gluten And Allergen Free Expo this year. They have a very extensive Gluten Sensitive Menu and EVERYTHING was delicious!! My husband and I felt so confident eating here because the entire staff was knowledgeable about cross contamination and gluten allergens. We met Jenn who is a fabulous bartender and very knowledgeable and she recommended some of her favorites to us. We will be making this a regular date night spot! It was OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I favorite date night restaurant food is fantastic pleasant romantic environment prices are responsible never a long wait"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. I would have liked their bar to one side or another. It's right in the middle of the place with TV's everywhere around it. Seams to be distracting and take away from what could be charming. 

Lunch:
·Salad: Romaine, beets, cucumber, cheddar cheese, and crease dressing.  Ranch dressing-  disappointing and watery

·Mashed potatoes- not the best, the taste was ok, also didn't care for the skin.

·Tuna poke & Super Food Salad - My friend Loved it, very good! Will definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Nice place with lots of options and a friendly staff. My issue is the price. I find it very overpriced for the quality. I wouldn't willingly opt to go back, but if someone I was joining chose to go there wouldn't be terribly upset- I'd just know it's over priced."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Burton's Grill and we had another great experience. The service has been very good each time. Our waiter was really charming and attentive. He suggested a few dishes from the menu, which we subsequently tried. His recommendations were great. The quinoa salad, paella, and short rib grilled cheese were so yummy. The wine, a Bordeaux, was really great and my husband's manhattans were strong and delicious. I would highly recommend Burton's for a fun, relaxed night out."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyable dinner of crab-stuffed haddock, rainbow carrots, jasmine rice with delightful sauce. This American style restaurant has delicious food from the seafood. You can choose your portion small or large and the haddock was incredible! I had the small but it's generous. I enjoyed looking at the other offerings & I cannot wait to try on my next trip. You know it's great food when you're already scoping out the next meal. Next time I will try the short ribs.

We walked in without reservations and they ended up being able to seat us quickly. They were very busy but cheerful. I tried the cocktail the classic mojito. It had lovely mint flavor and a bit light on the alcohol. Their beer and wine list was ample and they had NC local beers too (though they ran out of one of my faves). The service was helpful and polite and they made good suggestions. The atmospheric decorations and the bar with tvs had a comfortable vibe and laid back feel. You can dress casually and dine well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite a gem. There were six of us in the party, one of whom has multiple allergies. As noted in other reviews, the restaurant caters to people with specific dietary needs whether vegan, gluten intolerant or peanut allergies. Very interesting how it is all spelled out in the menu.  That said, they deliver on multiple points. The wine list, the appetizers as well as sandwiches and main dishes were all prepared very well to specific requests. As in the burger was medium to well done, the steak was medium rare and gluten free food was prepared as promised. The General Tso cauliflower was perfectly prepared and I had the chicken risotto which was outstanding. The restaurant was very clean as was the restroom. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Not anything that screams come back, except outside dining area.  Service mediocre.   Food over priced, fish sandwich was a nice flakey white battered piece and served with horrific greasy limp fries...... nasty is being nice.   Crab cakes, shame on me for being excited about them for brunch, looked tasty and are not. The grits are creamy, so good job on a item that usually is not always spot on, these are.  Refills are scarce and the water tasted odd.   38 bucks and still hungry."}
{"text":"Great food and impeccable service. I got the short rib entree and it was very good, only 4 star worthy though because I have had better but the service and ambience were wonderful and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. I love the decor, the materials the view of the kitchen, everything. It is sleek, modern and trendy. Yet, warm and inviting. The menu is awesome. I particularly like that they have plenty of GF and paleo friendly options. 

Food: We had the wing appetizer and it was good. It didn't blow my mind, but it was good. Crab cakes and Pork chop for entrees. Pork chop is ok. It didn't have too much flavor but the Brussel Sprouts and mashed potatoes were amazing. The crab cakes were very good. Bricktop's are better in my opinion but these were definitely holding their own. Little to no filler, all fresh crab. Sides were great. 

Service: The style of service is great but my server was off her game. She talked too much about things that I didn't need to hear, and her menu knowledge was non existent. Watching other servers though, I could see that was not the norm. Management was attentive and made up for an awkward server. We will definitely be back, but we are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"First time at Burton's. Have heard amazing things about it. We had burgers that were so good!! Delicious chocolate cake. Excellent waitress very comfortable vibe. Overall great experience would highly recommend and will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food! Fried cauliflower is scrumptious (appetizer). Great fresh variety of food including Chicken Risotto, Burgers, Salads and Sandwiches."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite for lunch and dinner! Excellent service, fun, artsy atmosphere, and the food is to die for! The most extensive gluten-free menu in Charlotte and very attentive to other food allergies, as well.Not noisy, so conversation is easy. I've never had a bad experience there after maybe 20 visits."}
{"text":"Love this place. Refreshing to see all the accommodations for dietary needs and the variety of choices for kids. Definitely our new favorite \"Go-To\" from now on."}
{"text":"Had dinner here awhile back and the food was great! they have a nice beer & wine list as well as some wonderful cocktails! Definitely will be back again & again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Burton's 2 time now. The first time was fantastic, great weather so we ate outside. Our waitress Bia was like a best friend as we bonded so well with her. The service, food, everything was great and we felt so lucky to find this place. The reason for 3 stars is our second visit was anything but great. The service was really slow. The waiter was barely attentive as he had a big party to attend to. The food did not seem as good though I ordered the same thing as the last visit. I will blame this on the long waits. The topper was when we ordered dessert. We order this trio of 3 desserts each in a glass that you sorta dig out of. We order and then wait, and wait, and wait when finally he shows up. My coffee which I got quickly was cold just to let you know how long we waited. As we are looking at the 3 desserts we realize 2 of them are the same. We flag down the waiter and tell him there are 2 that are the same and he then explains that they ran out of one of the desserts. I said \"and so your solution was to give us 2 of the same and hope we didn't notice?\" He apologized and comped the dessert but that was really bad manners. One of the desserts was sorta like a pound cake that was to be soaked in milks...was supposed to be moist but we could not dig into it because it was so dry....we gave up on that. We were there just under 2 hours. The best part of the visit was seeing Bia again. We will request her next time....if theres a next time."}
{"text":"I have had the best experience here! The service, the food, the atmosphere, all of it. Bree was our server and was spectacular. She knew the cocktails and menu so very well. Made wonderful suggestions. If you want someone to cater to you, she's your gal. Let's start off with the Philly spring rolls. They had a ton of flavor and couldn't be more perfect for a small bite before your food arrives. I ordered from the whim menu. The \"General Tso's Fried Cauliflower\" and honestly, I could eat it like popcorn. My friends loved everything and to be quite honest, our server really knew the menu and couldn't be more chipper. Thanks Burtons! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The service was excellent and accommodating to our requests. They offer a gluten free menu and it also had paleo diet choices. These options is one main reasons I decided to try it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here recently and the food was average to slightly above average. We had a tasty but overpriced short rib and a so so lobster pasta. Cauliflower app was great but also overpriced. We did get good service and for bringing out little one with us they were very kind."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Glad we made reservations. We were asked about gluten needs by hostess as we were greeted. Seated promptly and wait staff was right with us with menus and taking drink orders. Our party of 4 included a vegan and she was pleased with her choices. We were also impressed by half order options which many other restaurants don't offer. Wine, beer and cocktail selections were varied and numerous. I enjoyed a recommended red wine blend. Another in my party enjoyed a refreshing gimlet. All 4 of us had fish/seafood entrees but were very disappointed that at 6:30 the calamari was gone. My companions were very complimentary of their mahi mahi and haddock entrees. I had a shrimp and lobster pasta dish. It was okay but nowhere near the flavorful meal I had anticipated. We declined dessert but left sated and comfortably full. I thought the prices were a little high compared to other restaurants with similar menus. Salads, breads and other sides were a la carte. I may try the.lunch menu on a second visit."}
{"text":"Food was great - a little overpriced but really good quality. The restaurant has a sleek, upscale feel so it's a nice place for special occasions or for whenever you just want to feel fancy. I had the salmon piccata and the salmon was perfectly cooked; a half portion is very filling, although I wish there'd been less pasta and more salmon. Our table also got the kung pao cauliflower, which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, from the decor, to the sensitivity to food allergens, to the drink menu, and finally the outstanding food.  Hope this place is around for a LONG TIME"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this restaurant to open for a while now, however, we wanted to wait a week, let the kinks get worked out, check reviews, and friends thoughts. 

Not sure what \"Greg S.\" is smoking... Burton's Grille & Bar is awesome. Maybe he works for the competition?

The servers and management are on point and the  awesome bartenders remembered our names and favorite cocktails, a fresh squeezed grapefruit martini and Orchard Sangria... keep em coming!

There are many different menu options and a \"Whim Menu\" that changes almost daily. The seafood is delicious, especially the crab crusted haddock. 

A brunch menu on Sunday's would be amazing but either way, you have made regulars out of my Girlfriend and I.

Welcome to the neighborhood Burtons!"}
{"text":"Love Burton's. My husband and I have been there three times in the last few weeks. The stuffed grilled eggplant, Mediterranean risotto, and short ribs were yummy. The wait staff are so friendly and love sitting at the bar for a great meal with good prices."}
{"text":"The service was great and food was great!  The cauliflower appetizer is amazing -my husband even tried it and liked it!  It's a must! We also had the tuna nacho appetizer special, they were fantastic! I love that they offer half portions for your meal!"}
{"text":"An AMAZING experience.   If you have Celiac Disease, or if you just like a super cool atmosphere with amazing service and food, this is the place for you. Our server, Corey, was second to none!  He was so attentive, kind, funny, and really helpful with regards to my dietary limitations. Thank you Corey!!!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Vanessa. She's knowledgeable and friendly and makes for a great evening out with friends. Shrimp and grits on the specials menu was delish!"}
{"text":"our friends took us by here for appetizers and drinks. We will for sure be back for dinner. The menu was incredible, and the drinks were great...that is sometimes hard to find. The atmosphere was on point. Hoping to revisit here soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am celiac and they literally have over 4 pages of meals to pick from. I was in heaven!!! Danielle was amazing she described everything and handled us with 5 star service which is saying a lot for me. It's so hard to find restaurants that both my boyfriend and I like due to my allergy and him loving fried chicken and burgers and fries. He got his burger and lived it! My plate came separate and was prepared on special grills with care!!!! The manager and Danielle also recommended the dessert Trio. I was nervous because it was chocolate cake and cheese cake etc. ALL GLUTEN FREE and amazing. I can't express enough how great this place was. Even Management made sure that everything was taken care of!!! Def coming back asap."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to dine and drink at Burton's a few times at this point, and I have to say - I like everything about Burton's, and would recommend this spot if you're looking for spectacular service and excellent food with a twist of couth.  Here's everything you need to know about Burton's from the Grill to the Bar...

Parking:  Parking shouldn't be much of an issue as Burton's is located in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center.  That's not to say you're guaranteed to find a spot in the front row - but still no worries with parking.

Ambiance:  The first adjective that comes to mind is \"class\", but not in an overdone, pretentious sort of way.  The nice square bar situated right in the middle, affords plenty of seating and perfect views of the HDTV screens.  Burton's is one of those multi-purpose spots that works well for any occasion - as you can definitely feel comfortable bringing family from out-of-town, a romantic date, or even professional associates for a post-work cocktail.

Service:  The service couldn't be better.  They get the little things right  - for example -  plates were cleared immediately after I finished, I received constant refills on water and drinks and servers are super friendly and personable.  I can't imagine anyone having anything less than stellar service from the second you walk in.

Food/Drink:  So far I've had the wings - half memphis dry rub and half maple sriracha sauce.  Both sauces were unique and I loved them equally. I've eaten both the Maple Chicken and Cali Chicken sandwiches.  On account of the fact that it comes with bacon AND cranberry (when's the last time you had cranberries on a sandwich?), I prefer the Maple Chicken.  The Cali Chicken sandwich, being slightly healthier, is almost a superb option.  Oh and can't forget the fries - of course the regular fries are great, but if you wanna go all avant-garde, you can run parmesan french fries or sweet potato frites!  Burton's has one of those menu's that has a dozen different items that all look and sound good. 
 
What more can I say?? I've no complaints, I can't wait to go back and would def recommend (especially if you've never been before).  Burton's is an official member of my All-Goldilocks Team - a spot that seems to get everything Juuuuuuust-Right!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went for lunch and it was horrible. We ordered the Philly Spring Roll App which consisted of 3 rolls of something that tasted like it was a frozen dinner and it cost 12.95...wow! It was a very small menu where nothing cost less than $15 (for lunch) except for salads. I ordered a half of a Cobb salad and added chicken which made the cost $12.95 and received a side salad. I couldn't believe how outrageous the prices were for the amount of food we received. The menus were dirty and our servers shirt was also filthy. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ok a bit pricey 
Food was just ok
Nothing special won't be going back as better restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"First time trying Burton's. Tearing down the old building that housed so many resteraunt failures at this location was well needed. It was packed when we arrived but we had reservations. You have to somewhat akwardly walk by the massive bar area to get to the tables. First thing we noticed was how loud it was. They could use some noise dividers, but that may take something away from the open concept. I had the short rib grilled cheese at the recommendation of the server. It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely have it again. Prices are fair, maybe slightly overpriced but within reason. Service was prompt, no problems there.

The noise and the very large bar is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a fancier steakhouse type place or it's it's trying to be a bar with a kitchen. But overall I'd recommend giving it a try, it's one of the better resteraunts in Montford."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a weeknight to grab a drink and a snack.  The bartender recommended the General Tso's Cauliflower and we loved it!  I had the Cherry Bomb Old Fashioned which was sweet and spicy nectar of the gods!  Cool place with a huge wrap around bar-we'll def be back!  Outside patio looked nice, also."}
{"text":"Great overall experience for both quality food & service. Surprisingly family friendly for such a nice restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and the food was amazing. Hannah is the best server ever. Hannah and Mark were extremely customer service driven and made our large party feel at home. It was refreshing to have such good service and good food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We made our reservation via Yelp.  Super easy, and they were expecting us.   Off to a great start.   Cool place and a perfect fit to the neighborhood.  Lots of menu choices especially for specialized diners:  gluten free, locally sourced, and paleo entrees abound.

We all ordered a version of their haddock entrees (lunch sized).  The portions were more than ample and a good bargain IMO.  Moreover, they were prepared properly and tasted well.  All are do-overs.  The star of the day,  surprisingly, was the General Tsao Fried Cauliflower appetizer.  If my Mom cooked veggies like this when I was a kid, I would've gobbled our garden to the ground.  So. Very. Good.

Servers were excellent.  Thank you Hannah and your trainee Michelle.  Good job!  A couple issues beyond their control kept the score at 3.5 - 4 stars.  My very dry martini came out verrry dirty and had to be remade.  Lori's entrée was put in wrong and she received a crab cake and not the crab crusted haddock dinner.  They corrected the error and lowered the tab somewhat.

Overall, a good start to a place I can walk easily to from my home."}
{"text":"Average. That's the best I can offer as far a defining our experience. At the price point and the quality the food is at, our party all had slightly higher expectations. Burtons fell flat for us. 

Started with research on yelp, picking a new place to try for a family celebration. Went through yelp to make a reservation a week out, fast, easy, efficient. In the notes section of the reservation remarked that it was a family celebration. 

Get to the restaurant, friendly greeting and seated immediately...however we were seated in a high traffic area that would've seemed more appropriate for a walk in rather than a reservation that noted it was a celebration. 

Ok... quickly attended to by a friendly server. Next drink order. Husband ordered a beer, served the wrong one. And had to request a glass when he got the right one... looking around no one else was drinking from a bottle. 

Family ordered, food was... well average. Served fairly quickly for a busy night but nothing exceptional to note. I ordered the mussels and had to request a bowl for the shells. Burger that was ordered was cooked to ordered doneness. Pasta and chicken orders both were - well fine, perfectly average. 

Between the four of us, we ordered all over the menu. No one disliked, but no one raved. With so many other restaurants - several in walking distance - it's not that we won't be back, but I would be hard pressed to recommend, chose over one of the proven favorites or to give a another new place a first try - rather than go back. 

Really had hoped to at least feel like \"great time\" when we left, but did not hit that mark for us."}
{"text":"Nice looking modern restaurant in a nice shopping center. Location is great and Park Road Shopping Center gets another cosmetic upgrade. Pretty typical situation here. There isn't anything really awful about it, but there's certainly nothing that sets it apart from the competition. Prices are a little crazy on some things (namely appetizers) for the quality of the food and drinks, but again, none of it is awful. Service has always been good, no complaints there. 3.5 stars to be exact."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 3 stars since the entrees were good with three other friends in my table. However,  don't order the vegetarian dishes. I  had the Thai bowl, it was extremely salty. It tasted like they dumped half a bag of sodium into the dish.  I mentioned the problem with the waitress.  Nothing was done. We were disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"You can't beat the location. I love how they transformed what once was Monkey Joe's into a clean, well-decorated, and open restaurant in the Park Road Shopping Center.

I've been here a couple times for dinner and lunch. Each time the food was good. Once, we ordered a shrimp appetizer and it came out raw. They quickly fixed it without any hassle. I also tried the Reuben sandwich for lunch. It was very comfort-food for me. They offer a nice alternative menu for those of you on the Paleo plan. 

For what you get, it comes at a steep price in my opinion. I can't regularly plop down $50+ on lunch for a standard sandwich. 

The servers and management are nice and welcoming. They have a great patio and will be ideal for perfect weather days before going to see a movie."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is unique and sets the mood for how the restaurant experience will be. Upon entry we were greeted and asked if anyone was gluten free. That was a good sign that they cater to that. We ordered both breads with extra butter ($1.25 each) and well worth it. I had the mule that came in the cutest mule cup ever!! I need to find one for the house! The mule was made very well and tasty! For my meal I ordered the short rib grilled cheese with a side of broccoli (needed some veggies). It was very good and I added the fresh pesto that came with the bread which added even more flavor. The menu has paleo and vegetarian sections which is awesome for when people want to try a diet and still want to eat out."}
{"text":"Food is great but SERVICE is even better! We sent the fries back, not because they weren't good but we prefer very crispy french fries. The waitress brought them back piping hot and  sincerely wanted to make sure we were satisfied!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night, server was lackluster and steak was over cooked. Ordered med rare, received med well. Taste was good but disappointed in the temp. Creative cocktails were good."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great menu selection. The roasted beet salad and black bean burger were delicious. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a special treat. We were invited to the soft opening on a Friday afternoon and were warmly welcomed by the manager and waitstaff.

The waitstaff made helpful suggestions and placed our order using an electronic tablet.  

Their natural in house soda was food-coloring free and refreshing, a great mid-afternoon pick-me-up.

The entree portions were extremely generous.  We ordered beef short ribs and a fried fish sandwich, both full of flavor and had great texture.

We happily departed Burton's with leftovers in their chic take-away bags.

A must try restaurant.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Burtons."}
{"text":"Loved it, sat at the bar and only had appetizers but we will be back! A must try... Philly cheesesteak egg rolls !"}
{"text":"My Dad, sister and I do a \"Daddy & Daughters\" dinner date every few weeks. Burton's was recommended by my mother-n-law (a true foodie, like myself lol). Man, Burton's was wonderful from beginning to end. Customer service was great and on point!! The food was AHH-MAZING! We have a couple of spots that stay in our rotation and now Burton's is one of them. The drinks are well worth what you pay for, not weak or watered down by any means and delicious! Drinks for The table, margarita w/OJ, the sangria drink and a sauvignon blanc. I'm totally getting that sangria next time. The food was hot, prompt and absolutely delicious. The Philly roll appetizer recipe has been perfected! I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster and shrimp pasta. It may not look like a lot in the bowl but I barely put a dent in it #delicious. My sis had the porkchop and she raved about it from first bite. Our dad had the 14oz Rib eye and his plate was completely CLEAN (how sway?). Great portion sizes, great food and great service! Burton's is officially in our rotation."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. I love the menu and all of the gluten free options they provide. They also take your order and run your credit card right at the table. I really love the atmosphere here as well!"}
{"text":"Burton's Grill is wonderful for gluten free options. They take tremendous care in there preparation of the gluten free meals. I'm always impressed! The food is great, consistent and a good value. 
Our server Matt, exceeded our expectations with his attentiveness. 
Overall our experience was excellent!"}
{"text":"I brought some friends this evening to enjoy cocktails. Burtons did not disappoint. We tried almost every cocktail on the menu. Vanessa was awesome and recommended some excellent cocktails and appetizers. She kept our basket of chips full and was such a gracious hostess for us. She even took a picture of us that was awesome and did not make us  look fat. Vanessa was great and I will ask to sit at her tables next time. The appetizers were awesome. This is a great place to bring friends to have a great time!  Vanessa we love you!!"}
{"text":"Third time was a charm. After two previous not so great experiences Marc the GM got in touch with me right away and kept in constan contact with me until I was able to return to Burtons.  Cory our waiter was great and super polite.  The Manager on Duty made sure me and my boyfriend were treated like royalty.  My boyfriend was pretty impressed and I was blown away.  Food was great and hospitality was even better.  Thanks Marc for truly caring about your customers satisfaction with so much competition out there the way Charlotte is growing word of mouth and reviews mean a whole lot.. I give Burtons five stars and yes I will return and yes I will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"just revisited Burtons at the insistence of management and i am happy to report, it was one of the most enjoyable meals in memory.

service was top notch (thanks corey) and the food was prepared and presented with equal care and craft.  

marc and team are doing great things.  get to Burtons stat-"}
{"text":"This place was Amazing!! The whole experience was on point, the apps, drinks,entrees and the service. It's a chain but brand new to the Charlotte area and I highly recommend this place. It was a birthday dinner and I had the filet and Philly cheese steak spring rolls! Seriously great food!"}
{"text":"Adding a star since my first visit. Service has gotten better and I really enjoyed the salmon burger and sweet potato fries. Best sweet potato fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"Never been impressed but tonight has done it in. Went with a group, ordered a burger medium rare, it came out hard grey and dry ($16). Eventually the server came by and took it back to fix it. 15 mins later he comes by and says they are about to cook a replacement. At this point everyone else is done and looking for the check. I'm not going to make them all wait on me/the restaurant so I can eat. 

Manager (I guess? Looked to be about 14 years old) comes by as checks are being dropped and says \"Heard we messed up your burger, can we make you one to go?\" Seriously?  That's what how the corporate manual instructs you to deal with the situation?

Place is so basic. Poor man's corporate Firebirds with a better location, worse food, higher prices and awful management."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg food! My favorite place in Charlotte! There's something on the menu for everyone: folks with gluten sensitivity, folks that love a good steak, folks that love a good salad and those of us doing the paleo diet.  There's a section on the menu for Paleo and GF diets! You MUST try Burton's if you haven't!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I came with my brother early evening on a Sunday and it was more crowded than I thought. I saw groups, couples, families, all sorts of people together. 

Our waiter was very attentive and let us know about specials and how the kitchen is a made from scratch/custom kitchen so they can accommodate food allergies easily.  Everything is made to order. 

I had the California club with sweet potato fries that were delicious. Since I had a gluten-free bun, the manager plated and delivered my meal, which I appreciated. 

Yummy food, great service and a great ambience. Overall, really enjoyed my time at Burtons and hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and each time was wonderful. There are so many positives: the expensive menu and proactive approach to food allergies and sensitivities, delicious house cocktails, and the advanced POS system allowing the servers to place your order from the table. Don't forget to ask about their loyalty program!"}
{"text":"Both the hostess and server professed this to be a scratch made kitchen.  My interpretation of scratch made means, we do way more in house than your average bar and grill.  So it's a completely realistic expectation that you bake your own breads and deconstruct the meat from whole pieces. Otherwise you're really like most other bar and grills.  So being seated next to the kitchen, I wasn't happy seeing bread come from a bag and just the breast of the chicken for a roasted chicken plate.  Where's the rest of the chicken??

The decor and ambiance suggested this was certainly a bar and grill.  While it is nice on the inside, there are elements that don't fit the upscale theme.  Track lighting is low cost and effective for fast casual, but shouldn't be used for a full service that wants to price themselves on the upper end.  The menu layout felt like a cross between a steakhouse and a typical bar and grill.  The price point on the menu is what diners typically associate with  Finer Dining.  Each item is about 30% more than say a Hickory Tavern or comparable upscale Bar and Grill.  My expectation of the food was high once I was told this was a scratch kitchen and once I saw the pricing.

The food, while not bad at all, was really a let down from from expectations.  Service was very friendly, but just not formal enough to justify pricing.  Food was pretty good.
-Crab Cakes were jumbo lump, but not big pieces like you would see in MD
-Roasted Chicken was just a breast on a bed quinoa.  While the poultry was tender, it was just one average size breast. 
-Pork Chop is sourced from a good NC farm.  I've eaten this exact chop at another Charlotte restaurant.  My previous experience gave me a point of comparison, and Burton's was not as good.  Cooking chops is an art, they're often tough and easy to dry out.  Burton's came topped with mounds of red peppers and Parmesan in an attempt to mask the very average cook job of the pork chop 
-Wings were tasty and well cooked, but we expected more than 8 wings for $14

Final take.  Nice place with good food, but charging 30% more than equivalent food at other places.  The kitchen looked to be staffed with cooks, not chefs.  I love the idea of a place that offers really high quality food in an upscale casual environment.  The problem is that Burton's  food does not live up to the billing"}
{"text":"Burton's has an impressive roundup of menu items ideal for those with dietary restrictions/substitution preferences. Want to switch out a carb side for double vegetable? Easy. Need sauce on the side? No problem. I come from a family of picky eaters, so this flexibility is truly appreciated. We hate being difficult! 

My boyfriend and I split the stuffed zucchini appetizer. Italian food lovers will adore this dish! It reminded me of the lasagna/manicotti from Living Kitchen (the same pillowy texture inside with an al dente vegetable \"noodle\"), only this version is made with dairy cheese. 

For our main dinner, we ordered the knife & fork burger (him) and the shrimp romesco (subbed in for salmon as the paleo option). Both were delicious! Generous portions, warm and welcoming service, and a chic atmosphere? We found our new standby. Hopefully you will too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very allergy friendly! The dairy fee and gluten free calamri is amazing!! Great wait staff with lots of personality. The pomegranate martini is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Steve the Bartender is a wonderful person great to talk to. We are new in the area and he gave us the rundown. The atmosphere is awesome nice mature upscale crowd.  I highly recommend this place the food was great"}
{"text":"Awesome place food is fresh and has flair  I had lobster pasta and roasted brussel sprouts with bacon yummy  I will be back"}
{"text":"This is totally an after work bar. It actually screams it. But that's cool right?!?! Seeing everyone with drinks and apps in their Sunday's Best, that's when you realize life is sometimes stressful and we all need an escape from time to time...and Burton's is it!!! I only had apps that were ok but I will be back to try an actual meal. The drinks were good and strong just like I love it!!!! Also while you're there sample their homemade chips...oh so scrumptious. You won't be able to eat just one. I promise"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service. Honestly- the service is surprisingly a standout. They had one mistake in our salad and went out of the way to correct and make up for it. 
Get the sangria, and the cauliflower!!!"}
{"text":"I had a very delicious Cobb salad. My daughter had the Super Food Salad and said it was the best salad she had ever eaten. My wife had the grilled salmon, which was also very good. Reisling did not have the expected flavor. Seemed to be Oaked and heavier than other Reislings."}
{"text":"My Wife and I came here on a double date last night. Made reservations through yelp and got our table quickly. Our Server was very knowledgeable about the menu as my wife is Gluten Free and the options are the best we have found in Charlotte, catering specifically to her. A few food items came out wrong but very quickly corrected. People are very quick to base an opinion on something so petty, shit happens. Food was excellent, drinks were great, you should definitely become a frequent diner member, we got $25 off of our bill and was completely unexpected."}
{"text":"Lovely evening---great ambience! Bartenders could use a little more knowledge on fru fru--basic drinks?--no one knew how to make a French 75?! No biggie--wine list was appreciated. 

Must try the cauliflower Thai chili scrumptious and gluten and dairy free!! Calimari sensational!!

My haddock was buttery and seasoned perfectly. 

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  What a great addition to the Park road shopping center.  My friends and I came during restaurant week with no reservation on a Saturday evening during dinner time.... why not live in the edge?!  We were told there was about a 45 minute wait.  It was cold outside, so we waited.  Our wait was more like 15 minutes which was awesome and maybe because we hung out right by the host station and they were tired of looking at us .  
The stuffed grilled zucchini was a tasty app we shared... they were made to order and a huge sharing portion for the three of us.  My friends had the risotto and the short ribs and were equally impressed!  I had the crab cakes with a superfood salad.  The salad was super tasty but served on a long rectangular plate that is a clumsy girl's like me worst nightmare but delicious all the same.  The crab cakes were tasty but I probably would not have chosen the mustard sauce it came with.
The service was super attentive and very kind.  I love the huge bar in the middle of the restaurant and look forward to checking this place out when it gets warmer with the patio.  I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"I had dined here before for lunch, so I was excited to schedule date night here with my fiancée. The only issue I had was that we were asked right off if we have dietary restrictions/allergies and I let the server know I was vegan. She nodded her understanding and got our drink orders. From my previous visit I knew which vegetarian items could be made vegan and had my order ready to go. I got the vegetarian risotto and asked for her to have it made \"vegan style\" (no cheese, no butter sauce). My food then came out with cheese and butter. Luckily I saw the cheese prior to taking a bite as I do have a dairy allergy. The waitress seemed completely surprised that I didn't want dairy. For a place that asks about diet up front I expected better. It should be noted that my lunch experience was with a very educated waiter who knew exactly how to prepare (or ring in) my food - hence the 4 stars. The manager brought my new dish - no apology, no discount."}
{"text":"Very good service, good food and very nice atmosphere.  Overall experience was positive.  

Maybe a better assortment of appetizers would be nice.  Something to share as a group. 

The variety for entrees and desserts was much better.  

Espresso would have been nice to finish off the meal."}
{"text":"Walking in we were immediately greeted warmly and genuinely by the hostess and manager. We first went to the bar while our table was gotten ready with a high chair for the joining members of our party. We had a drink with the bartender, Richard, who was fast and friendly.

Our server Angela was excellent and took her time to make sure everything was perfect. She never made us feel rushed even though we could tell the restaurant was filling up quickly. 

Our food was egg rolls, Caesar salads, risotto provencal with bronzed shrimp added, a burger and a children's meal was all perfectly prepared by the kitchen. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold and exactly as we ordered. 

The manager, Marc, visited with us from the time we entered until we left. He was assertive and engaging without being overbearing or a nuisance. Observing him throughout the restaurant was impressive. He managed to be everywhere at once and never appeared to be in a rush. 

Burton's decor and ambience is refreshing in the Charlotte food scene. TV's, art and classy design usually don't all come together so well. 

This is an excellent addition to the Charlotte market and perfectly positioned in the Park Road area."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for drinks and an early dinner
At 4:15 PM. The restaurant was not busy and about half the seats at the bar were empty so we sat there.  We waited 5 minutes and finally 1 of the 2 bartenders (older gentleman) called over \"be right with you!\"  from the other side of the bar. 

Waited another 3-4 minutes as he actually exited the bar area several times and returned to help other patrons.  As we were sitting at the entry gap on the bar, he should not have forgotten us - he walked past us at least 3 times.  Finally, the patrons to our right, noticing we were still sitting with no menu, offered us theirs.  We looked at the menus for about 5 minutes and the bartenders still didn't come come by to check on us.  At about the 15 minute mark, a couple of ladies came in and sat at the corner of the bar and the bartender went right over and offered them menus and asked what they'd like.  He seemed to know them.  At this point, we decided to cut our losses and leave.  As we were putting our coats on, the bartender came rushing over and said 'what / just drop in and leave?'.  I simply replied - 'the bad service so far doesn't not bode well for a meal.  We'll take our business elsewhere.'.  We left."}
{"text":"Is it a neighborhood place or a small chain trying to be neighborhood?  I still can't quite decide. Some of the food items are spot on while others seem commercial and overly salty. Great cocktails, warm and inviting atmosphere. 

If they can lower the sodium level of some selections and be more consistent I will upgrade to a four star. 

Huge bar in the middle of the place is busy and has TVs, but it doesn't stay open late. By 10pm they wind down.  Outdoor patio is huge."}
{"text":"This review is an update from my previous review, however before I write my updated review I want to give major kudos to the General Manager Marc Habbouche. Upon seeing that my first dining experience at the restaurant was not pleasant he reached out to me right away to resolve the matter. That says a lot about this establishment and shows me that not only does Burtons Grill & Bar value feedback from their customers but they take their reputation as a fine dining establishment seriously.. So now I'm going into my updated review. Upon me and my guest arriving to the restaurant the hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us at a booth. Not long after our server Josh came out and went over the menu with us. The one thing that rocks about Burtons is that they have something on the menu to appease everyone and if you have a food allergy they will accommodate your specific dietary needs. As an appetizer I settled on the Fried Green Tomatoes that came with a side of homemade pimento cheese. The appetizer was freshly made and simply amazing not to mention that the pimento cheese is made fresh in the kitchen and has the right out of spicy kick to it that was perfect. I also ordered a drink called the Spicy Paloma and my guest had a Spiked Summer Slush both of our cocktails were awesome. As for my main entree I ordered the Thai Bowl and it rocked it was the perfect combination and sweet and spicy I eat vegetarian so I really love how their has a dedicated vegetarian section on the menu. Lastly to top it I had a dessert that knocked my socks of it was a combination of three delicious cakes/ pudding dessert, one was chocolate with by the way is Gluten Free another was a creamy cheese cake desert with blueberries and another was a caramel flavored dessert. Overall my dining experience was a complete 180 compared to the last time I dined with Burtons , not only was the ambiance and food top notch but the staff is very friendly and accommodating also the General Manager Marc Habbouche come out to greet me at my table personally he made me feel right at home, I was also greeted by the Assistant Manager Taylor and when you go to this place make sure to request Josh as your server he's awesome! Josh had a pleasant demeanor and really personalized my dining experience and checked back on me and my guest frequently and made sure that we were very well taken care of! If you are looking for great food with a beautiful ambiance with a personalized dining experience please be sure to check out Burtons! I'll surely be back! Thank you for making my dining experience a memorable one!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with attentive servers. Menu is diverse but not much for people who like simple but good food. Lots of ingredients which I like but others in our party needed to ask for changes in basic items like chicken sandwich and flatbread.  The fish sandwich was very good. Perfectly cooked, bun was awesome, fried pickles are a great touch. Our server was great. We thought it was taking a bit too long to get our food but before we could say anything the manager came over to apologize and offered an appropriate concession.  There are many things to try on future visits so I'll be back and would recommend to others to give it a try."}
{"text":"Love the Moscow miles!

The are a little pricey, but I always feel
Like I get my money's worth.

The wild mushroom tortellini is next level!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. I enjoyed the crab encrusted haddock and my husband enjoyed the black bean soup and huge house salad. Together we enjoyed their fried green tomatoes. A very warm inviting place accompanied by excellent service by Kara.
Thank you!! We will be returning with friends so they can check it out too. A bit of a drive but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Our experience was pretty good.  Not sure I'd be climbing over myself to get back any time soon, not that I wouldn't go back.  The atmosphere is great.  Beer selection good.  My husband and I had the special- risotto catch.  The server described it as flaky white fish.  We both found the fish to be tough, almost needing a knife to cut.  It had a good flavor though.

Our server was nice enough.  He described the entrees with very generic terms.  \"Our risotto is good, served with a flaky white fish and spices.\"

May give this place another try, but not anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good considering how many people they we're helping. I didn't particularly like my Argentinian steak, the steak really lacked flavor and was fatty. My dad got another New York strip steak and the flavor was great. We had the fried calamari and I would recommend it but the best appetizer is the fried califlour !"}
{"text":"Two stars only for prices
5 Stars for food and service
Had a Stella Draft and a cheeseburger with fries fries needed to be seasoned and I think they were baked but were stuck together tasted alright 
Stella always good however $7.00 for a draft pricy
Cheeseburgers Both  good but $14.95 for a cheeseburger too high 
I've had other cheeseburger that were just as good in the $10-12 range and I never paid more that 
$6.00 for a Stella draft most places it's $5.50
Bartender was very personal and good
Not sure if I want to spend close to $30.00 for lunch which includes tip
Place open 4 months hope they make it
Think they should recalculate food and beverage cost not sure if going back"}
{"text":"First time visiting. I asked the hostess for a table for one and she asked if I would like to sit at the bar. 
Grr. If I had wanted to sit at the bar I would have sat at the bar. 
A little loud with a few holiday parties going on and football on television.
Lots of conversation among the staff about who is working when, that party that came in earlier, was last weekend better than this weekend... Not awful but annoying.
14oz strip came out quickly with the waitress saying \"here you go and leaving\"...
But it was at the correct doneness and temperature. Steak was good, brussels sprouts could have used more fat but the char was good, mashed potatoes were non-descript.
Good liquor selection and friendly folks. I don't think the steak was worth $30 but it was good. Drinks could be cheaper, server said they had $5 drafts like it was a deal.
I'd try it again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"So many gluten free options. The crab cakes were amazing, which is something I never come by being allergic to gluten. My boyfriend got the Maxx burger. It was HUGE and delicious. Service was incredible and love the fact that yes could make reservations, considering so many restaurants in Charlotte don't let you"}
{"text":"Wow! In every aspect, this restaurant met and exceeded the mark! We started with the General Tso's cauliflower and it was unbelievably delicious. This could be one of the many reason for wanting to return! Then, I had a salad with arugula, quinoa, and bronzed salmon. I ordered the smaller lunch portion and it was plenty filling and a great size. I would recommend this size, instead of the bigger portion. The service was impeccable and they made it clear that they could accommodate based on any allergies or special dietary needs. My only recommendation to this restaurant would be to add sweet and low to the selection of sweetners. It is my sweetener of choice and they only had Truvia, Splenda and regular sugar. I need my PINK PACKETS! Overall, this is a first class restaurant. Already I can't wait to return. The food, service, and atmosphere are all things to write home about!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice. Lighting was just right for a night out with your friends or your significant other. I especially liked the light fixture. Anyways, the cauliflower was sooo good. I had a salad that was on the weekly special menu and it was awesome. I think it was called the Harvest Salad which had lots of dried fruits. I loved it. I didn't get a chance to try any dessert. I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Not coming back even though you comped 2 of 4 meals. Over cooked fillet, two chances both wrong. Cold dry braised short ribs and mashed potatoes returned, second chance warm with cold edges still dry; not appetizing at all.   Braised short ribs and mashed potatoes impossible to eat in the bowl in which it was served. Put it on the plate please. Previous visit salmon was dry and only warm.  Very disappointing for a well-designed restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, but decent food at high prices. I was torn between the fish sandwich and fish tacos - both somehow the cheapest things on the menu at $15. Was told the fish tacos were haddock, as the fish sandwich was. I've never had 'fishy' haddock, but it was quite fishy, and the tacos were average...and you only get 2...for $15. So for 2 tacos, a fish sammy (friend's - and she loved it), and 2 beers, the bill was $55 with a decent tip, for lunch."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Make reservations!Service very good. The Haddock was a bit fishy and not a lot of flavor otherwise. Maybe just an off night. We will try again."}
{"text":"Burton's is amazing! The gluten free and allergy free offerings are exceptional & I felt completely safe eating at Burton's because Corey was so knowledgeable on ingredients & took the time to talk us through the options with our allergies. The service was impeccable and The food was delicious - apps, entrees & desserts! Everyone in our party enjoyed our meal - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went the first time today. The food was amazing and you could it was fresh using top quality products. The ambiance was great and the place was huge with a great bar. Just went for lunch but would love to hang out and try the entire menu lol ... they cater to everyone vegan, gluten free, paleo... just good stuff...."}
{"text":"1st timer! Right off the bat it was crowded but had reservations and zoomed right in, service was good from our server! Appetizers were very good and for the most part entrees were good! However one order from the table was put in wrong, and the manager came over but she wasn't a ball of fire in the pleasing the customer category. I had the pork chop and it was amazing but my broccoli was very bitter for some reason. Then we noticed that other tables orders were wrong as well. Must of been a bad night in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I have A LOT food allergies. It's hard to find good restaurants who actually care. This restaurant is wonderful! They really cater to people with food allergies. The food is delicious, they have FANTASTIC customer service and the atmosphere is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"First time at Burtons and we loved it! It is a beautiful space with a cool atmosphere. Started with the General Tso's Cauliflower appeitizer going on a tip- yum!! The steak and risotto was incredible.  We left planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"I learned about Burtons on the local \"Celiac\" Facebook group.  As you can tell from my reviews, I love going out to eat.  I like to get out of the house but mainly love eating and trying new things.
My Daughter has Celiac Disease and it's hard to go out because most restaurants and servers don't understand about cross contamination so we wind up eating at home lately because we can control what we do in our own kitchen.
Burtons was an absolute delight!  We were immediately welcomed with a gluten free menu and an explanation about how they are very sensitive to a gluten free diet.  Separate fryers, safe handling procedures and pretty much everything on their menu can be prepared gluten free.  We started with the General Tso's cauliflower...simply put, AMAZING!  Not too spicy and the cauliflower had a nice texture and was very flavorful.  My daughter had the lobster & shrimp pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed since she rarely gets to eat pasta.  Sweetie had the salmon romesco which she also liked.  Me?  I'm not celiac and ordered the Beef Short Ribs.  Very tender and flavorful.  Simple and delicious.  It had a MESS of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  
We finished off with the \"trio\" dessert which had a cheesecake, brownie and butterscotch in mason jars.  Excellent!
I must mention the service also.  I was impressed with Red, our server.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and how Burton's takes care of those with food allergies.  You can tell he was trained well and represented the place well.
Burton's is a welcome addition to our dining rotation.  We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I've visited Burton's once before and was impressed with their unique but crowd pleasing menu, so it was my recommendation for our monthly team lunch at work.
It was a hit - I have one co-worker who just went gluten-free and they are so sensitive to anyone with dietary needs or allergies.
Don't think this results in a boring menu, however, the cauliflower appetizer has this crazy good Asian sauce and the calamari is different because they also fry up fresh peppers. The short rib sandwich (rib mean plus mac and cheese made into a heavenly grilled cheese) is my favorite but the bourbon shrimp and grits I had today were amazing.
Nice patio which we didn't get to enjoy today since it was too hot, but great place to go after work when it cools down. Go to the gelato place that is in the Park Road Center parking lot for dessert and then go bowling at park lanes = perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Hi key obsessed with this place.  The food and staff are always on point.  I love the short rib dinner w the julienned veggies.  It's to die for.  Also the bartender, I can say this bc I am one, slays the cocktails!  Love spending my hard earned dollars here."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Everything I have had here is amazing! The food selection is great. Even the kids menu is spectacular. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was really excited about trying the place. Food was good but timing and service was a train wreck tonight. Management responded very well and we will try it again. Thing happen and they are nice people having an off day."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was slow! They have the waitresses use an electronic device instead of pen and paper to take orders and that slowed the process at least 30 minutes! They seemed confused and the process of ordering was painfully slow! Other than that we loved it"}
{"text":"Since my husband is a fan of this restaurant due to dietary restrictions that they can accommodate, we have been back a few times since the first review that I wrote and I can say that they have redeemed themselves.  In general, we are fans of the General Tso fried cauliflower appetizer, the burgers, salmon, Mediterranean salad and  the Key Lime Pie."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Burtons Grill & Bar of Charlotte. It's located at the opposite end the Harris Teeter at Park Road Shopping Center. The ambiance is dim and warm, which I like. But it also has a few tvs around the bar area in case you'd like to quietly check out the game. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was very good. I had pork chop, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The pork chop was cooked perfectly. Nice medium warmth and quite juicy! We certainly will be back. I think I'm gonna try a burger next time. Saw the waiter walking by with it and it looked so good, I almost changed my mind about the Pork Chop!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip and we weren't disappointed. Our waitstaff person Michelle was knowledgeable about the wine with a good recommendation and the various meals. We had the appetizer special grilled avocado stuffed with crab meat, quinoa and some sour cream it was great. We had 2 different salmon dishes one was salad with grilled salmon mine was bronzed salmon which is a lighter version of blacken with veggies. Both were cooked to order and delicious. 
Nice outdoor covered patio add good food, good wine and great service made for an enjoyable time. We will be going back again.

{"text":"Meh with a side of bad service. The menu isn't creative or special and it's overpriced for what it is. Expect to pay about $50 per person for dinner. At that price, you should get good service but you won't. We had reservations but had to wait 20 minutes for a table with no communication as to what was happening. We waited another 20 for drinks. Another 20 for salad. At the hour mark, about 35 seconds after getting our salad, the entrees came. They were not worth the wait. None of us were impressed and the server took forever to check in with us. Managers? Non-existent.

It's a real pity because my wife is gluten-free with lots of options but she wasn't impressed. I understand Charlotte doesn't have lots of options so I guess this is a place to go. But I doubt it's in your regular rotation given the other issues.

If the food were awesome, I could look past poor service but it's a menu you can find at so many other places that do it better or charge you less. It's just a meh place that really thinks it's cooler than it is. You can and should do better than eating at this souless corporate restaurant with a big interior design budget."}
{"text":"Oh what a delightful time I had! They have a beautiful completely coveted area for outside seating, rain shouldn't be a problem here. Although my waiter was new he made some recommendations that were all hits, starting with the General Tso's Cauliflower. Veggies can't really taste that good, peso I thought before this dish. Absolutely AMAZING! I had several hours to kill so I enjoyed a few cocktails, each better than the one before, the sangria mimosa being my favorite. I had the crab cake for entree. Several gluten free options noted on the menu and daily specials. You definitely want to check this place out."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants I've been to lately. Great ambiance and decor, and the food was excellent (our table tried a few appetizers and sampled a few main dishes--the verdict was items exceeded expectations!). But most of all I have to compliment wait staff and management! Service was EXCELLENT! We were there for a large company Christmas party and despite our numbers (not to mention it was already a busy Friday night for them) they worked very hard to make sure we didn't wait for things, everyone had what they needed, dishes in the way were picked up quickly, and they were very professional and friendly about everything (although I'm sure they must have felt overwhelmed by us all!). We had a lot of different people on their staff helping our tables and every one of them was great! I will definitely be back (mainly because I need to try the rest of their excellent-looking martini menu and main dishes I had a hard time not choosing!) and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have a gluten-free menu and handle requests with all food allergies with a dedicated area in the kitchen.  

I'm very happy that this bar/restaurant is in the Park Road Shopping Center area.  I think a bar with great TV's for sports but with excellent food has been needed in this area for quite some time.  

The food is excellent.  We've tried several things on the menu and have never been disappointed in the flavors or presentation or consistency.  Compliments to the Chef and his kitchen staff.

The decor features interesting bits of framed art.  No particular style, but eye-catching fun.  Large windows at the entrance/bar really open the place up.  The patio is separate from the bar area and is covered so that is a plus.

My only slight is from the perspective of bar service.  The bartenders are very friendly and nice when you talk to them, but it can be a chore to get their attention.  No-one seems to make eye-contact or stay engaged with customers wanting refresh's on their drinks.  I'm not sure if this is from a bar design perspective or uncaring floor managers, but it can be a bit frustrating watching them chatting with each other while you're trying to get their attention.

That being said...  it's a great place for catching up with friends, watching sports and getting great food."}
{"text":"I had zero expectations coming here, not having heard any reviews but I was absolutely blown away by the food. The zucchini wraps or roll ups....so incredibly delicious with the goat cheese filling and Parmesan topping. I could've eaten my weight in them. And then, i thought things couldn't get better - I get my chicken wings. The rub on them was THE BEST I've ever had. I'm from Memphis and this run had a very strong resemblance to our world famous Rendezvous dry rub. The wings were SO perfectly crispy on the outside and so perfectly cooked, I had almost wished I didn't eat the zucchini rolls so I could eat more wings. Hands down one of the best quick meals I've ever had. And this is my second restaurant review EVER. Seriously delicious food and the atmosphere is a great blend of being  upscale yet laid back. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here to try the reuben, but after that experience I'm eager to get back and try some of the more serious food on the menu.

As I continued journeying around Charlotte to try all of the reubens, I stopped by a place I had been looking forward to trying as Burton's is the most upscale restaurant with a reuben on the menu. The sandwich was described as a delicious reuben, and it did not disappoint. From a flavor standpoint, Burton's reuben was one of the best of the approximately 30 I've tried around the Queen City. The corned beef was very unique - full of flavor and almost melted in your mouth. Very different than the corned beef I had become accustomed to in a very positive way. It set the sandwich apart as the rest of the sandwich was pretty average (but corned beef is the most important part to a reuben so that's OK!). The bread was well crisped but just standard rye, the cheese was good but not very plentiful, and the proportions (aside from the cheese) were spot on. The one miss was the kraut - it was clearly added to the griddle along with the corned beef. This dries the kraut and leads to an unpleasant stringy texture, and if this hadn't been the case the reuben would have been one of the best 3 in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!! Also have sweet potato fries which you can't always get. Highly recommend. I can't wait to try other items on their menu"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on Yelp for a Saturday date night at Burtons.  I joined their rewards program earlier in July and received a $10 coupon, so that was another good reason to go to Burtons!

Our reservation was for 6:30, but we got there around 6:15 and we're seated immediately.  

The ambiance is trendy and modern.  It's a really open environment and there is a nice patio if you want to sit outside.

Our waitress came over and we ordered two American mules.  They are made justttt the way I like them, not super sweet.  

For an app we got the general tsos cauliflower appetizer and it was delicious.  It had the right amount of crisp and the sauce was delicious.  The app was brought out quickly and our waters never were empty.

We split the 14oz New York strip for dinner.  I ordered it medium rare and subbed out garlic truffle fries and mushroom risotto for the sides.  Our meal was split evenly for us, which was a nice touch.  The steak was seasoned perfectly but was over cooked, I didn't want to send it back because we were hungry .  It was more medium with barely any pink, but still tasted delicious.  The fries were amazing!  

At the end of the meal there was an issue with my coupon and I had to give the waitress my phone, which was a little strange, but overall had a great experience.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the steak being medium and the coupon issue.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly!!

I am not vegan but my Sister is and we often have to decide where we can go to enjoy a meal together.
The hostess was kind and very welcoming. She greeted us with a smile even though they were closing in an hour.
The restaurant is beautiful and \"grown folk sexy.\" Wonderful place for a romantic date or a BFF outing.
We had calamari, a vegetable soup, sandwiches and dessert. We ate as much as we could  everything was so delicious but the serving sizes are so large we all had to take some of pur entrees home.
We had cocktails that were yummy and gluten free.
Enjoy their great service; yummy, well presented food and comfortable seating. It was such a pleasure to relax and eat while being pampered by our waitress!!"}
{"text":"Great food choices, quality & portion sizes, along with a great atmosphere. Service could be improved. On our first visit, we had a great server. This past visit, the server could have been more helpful with plate descriptions and attentive.  Will definitely continue to visit this establishment, and please don't forget to ask for the incredible General Tso's Cauliflower Appetizer. Not always on the menu, but they will make it upon request."}
{"text":"It was wonderful to walk in a restaurant and be asked if I would like a gluten free menu. So many choices for someone with celiac disease!  Food was really delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great new find! The atmosphere is was comfortable but still upscale. The crowd was definitely older but that that may be due to location. I had the braised short rib which was very tender. My date had the lobster and shrimp pasta dish that contained tons of meat! Both were very good choices. I will definitely return to this modern spot. Ask for Cory :) great service!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I desperately needed to get out of the house and grab a drink and Burton's was an excellent choice. It was equal distance between us and open on Easter Sunday evening. 

When we arrived there were a few people eating outside and a few more inside. The atmosphere was very nice. 

Our waiter Jacob was very nice and knowledgeable. I wasn't really hungry so I ordered the appetizer special Risotto Fritters and my friend got the California Chicken sandwich with a side of rice. My Risotto Fritters were delicious. The sauce was amazing. It was just enough. We both also ordered drinks. I got the Basil Lime Gimlet and she got the Allen Wrench.  Both drinks were good but we both preferred the Gimlet more. 

I will def have to come back and try some of their other drink and menu options. I see a Cherry Cola Old Fashioned and the Maple Sriracha wings in my future!! It was very exciting to see they have paleo/ low carb options and even gluten free. When we arrived the hostess even offered us a gluten free menu. Jacob also let us know that if we had any food allergies they could basically cater to them because they make most of everything from scratch.

{"text":"Had a spur of the moment dinner with friends last week. Hot evening with no reservations of course meant we were seated outside. Other than the sun glare, the meal was outstanding. I've been fortunate to have traveled quite a bit, including throughout Latin America. Burton's served up the best corvina I've had, ever.  Fresh, succulent, and spiced just right. Service was gracious and professional. Don't let the franchise tag mislead. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for lunch a few weeks ago and sat on the patio with another couple. Hannah was our server and she went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful (grabbed trash such as straw wrappers off of our table, traded in our app silverware for new silverware for our meal, made sure our drinks were always full, checked on us as soon as our food was delivered, and had our checks ready and split when we were ready to roll). She was very knowledgeable on the menu and the specials, offering several recommendations. We decided to go with Hannah's suggestions for apps: General Tso's Cauliflower and the  signature wings. I didn't dive into the cauliflower but it looked incredible. The wings were delicious - both the dry rub and maple sriracha sauce were packed with flavor without too much heat. For our main course My husband had the short rib grilled cheese (he said his was amazing), and I had the black bean burger (mine was okay). The 5 stars is mainly for receiving such great service here. There are a lot of great places to eat in Charlotte, but sometimes top notch service is hard to come by. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was am amazing treat. I had an extended layovernin Charlotte,  and an old friend from high school picked me up to spend the day together. She is both Celiac-intolerant and diabetic, so I was nervous about where we could go to share a meal. The interwebs recommended Burton's, and we were not disappointed. The MLT burger was filled with flavor, and the subtlety of the mushroom risotto was greatly appreciated. What really made the experience exceptional, however, was our server, Jacob. He was attentive to exactly the right degree, neither ignoring nor endlessly harrassing us. He allowed us to sit at the table all afternoon, continually bringing me hot water and lemon to nurse an oncoming cold. I do not know when I will be in Charlotte again, but if time allows I will most certainly be back. BTW--the cheesecake was amazing, too!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I have Celiac disease, and they go the extra mile to make sure my food is prepared and served separately (the manager brings my food on a separate plate to the table). Food is also delicious, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Reasonably priced and great atmosphere. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I've gone multiple times and I always enjoy my meal.   Love the atmosphere despite location."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance with a perfect outdoor dining space. Staff members are attentive, friendly, and professional. I loved our grilled avocado appetizer drizzled with an expert mojo and the sweet/salty cocktails we sampled, but my entree fell short. While I was impressed with the freshness of ingredients and the generous chunks of lobster and large shrimp the dish (lobster and shrimp pasta) was far too bland for me. I had to keep salting it throughout the meal and felt that it was missing something essential (spice, cheese...something?). I sampled my friend's hot wings and they were just so-so. Burtons is on the cusp of becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Charlotte restaurant scene but they need a little nudge in the right direction. I'd love to see the executive chef take an Eat, Pray, Love type tour and spend some serious time in Italy, India, and Bali to soak up those food cultures and become more comfortable with spices and oils. Less emphasis on fad diets (gluten-free, paleo, blah blah snore) and more emphasis on creating excellent flavor combinations please!"}
{"text":"There wasn't anything wrong with my experience at Burton's; however, it was underwhelming in every aspect. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything you couldn't find better somewhere else. The drinks were pretty much the same. The service was good, the server was on top of everything for our party of six, but who cares if the food doesn't stand out in any way? If you're in search of an average contemporary dining experience with solid service then perhaps this is what you are looking for but I was just consistently let down by the mediocrity of everything I tried. I don't think anyone at our table finished anything completely except the buffalo dip appetizer. With Dilworth and South End right around the corner, you can find much better in the area."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! We had a terrific server. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. I was delighted and I will definitely return. Make sure to keep an eye out for their \"whim menu\"."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each was a positive experience. We love the gluten free menu option. We will be back."}
{"text":"Rating at a 3 because my experience was \"A-Ok\". The moral of the story is to listen to your waitress when she makes recommendations. I took a friend out to eat for her birthday and we enjoyed ourself. After being seated, a lady told us that she was just taking our drink order, but ended up serving the entire time without clarification. No big deal. She recommended the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer. It was great, but not a hefty portion, as the dish in which it was served was shallow. I make the same at home, just as good. 

She also recommended the pork chop. My friend let me taste, and it was great. Funny how other people's food always taste better than your own. That's just life. Rather than going with her recommendation, I looked at pictures on Yelp and did my own thing, having the crab crusted haddock. I was unimpressed. My first bite was dry and bland. The internal portion wasn't dry however. I asked for some lemon butter to add a little pizzazz, which made it edible. Nevertheless, if you are on the fence, choose something else, as it lacked flavor. The crab wasn't crabby. The rice and vegetables were fine. And it's not that the haddock was bad, it just wasn't good - flavorless. Salt/ pepper/ lemon juice/ Old Bay....something would've worked wonders.I managed to eat it all. 

Lastly, the large portion was very large. If Really hungry, get it. Otherwise, get the smaller portion."}
{"text":"The clean lines and cool ambiance will make you feel as though you're in LA and not just the parking lot of a once-dated-but-now-ultra-hip shopping plaza. The Cherry Lime Rickey is my go-to drink. FINALLY, a cocktail with Reyka Vokda (if you've ever had it, try it ASAP!). The zucchini appetizer with the cheese and tomato sauce, the buffalo dip, the pastas, the burgers- all of it. It's one of our new favorite hang out/ date spots for sure! I'm obsessed with the decor inside. Always something to look at- and perfect place to bring anyone with a food allergy of any kind. If you have friends that struggle with gluten or dairy intolerance, sigh no more. You've found your place!"}

{"text":"Pros:
Good menu
Good food
Good service

Cons:
Too pricy for what it is - fancy bar food

I'd go back if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to go."}

{"text":"Excellent gluten free selections! Delicious food with awesome flavors and great service! My new go to restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been fortunate enough to attend a quite a few events here and always have a great time. The wrap around bar is HUGE, so no matter where you sit...you can see everything!!!  I wanted to grab something to eat here but the new Shake Shack was calling my name so we just did happy hour.  Great space for happy hours, work events or meetings.  Wine list is stellar! I'll definitely keep this place in mind when I'm planning events."}
{"text":"I love Burtons Grill! I think this is the perfect place to relax with family and friends and enjoy a yummy dinner. My fiancé and I dine here often, and we've brought numerous people with us and they've all loved Burton's as well!

Make a reservation if you plan to dine in on the weekends. They have a large bar area and nice indoor and outdoor seating options. 

The waitstaff is friendly and attentive. I have no food allergies myself, but this restaurant really really caters to those who do. I always order a Moscow mule, the fried cauliflower appetizer (this is a must try), and a 1/2 salad with a protein (my favorite is the house salad)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed Burton's for dinner last night. Our server, Danielle, was the best server either of us have ever had. She did an awesome job explaining the menu and how the restaurant started, and also was ready to share her recommendations from the menu. The food and cocktails were excellent! I was bummed when I couldn't finish my meal (too much food!) but Danielle offered to box it up and keep it in the fridge until we could come back for it after seeing a movie. I was very impressed with her customer service and we can't wait to go back there and ask for her again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The drinks are amazing and so is the food. Gets crowded on the weekends which makes it more fun in my opinion. My husband and I will continue to tell all our friends about this gem."}
{"text":"We went last week for dinner on a Friday night around 6:30.  There was definitely confusion with the host stand on who to seat next and the host sat a couple who just walked up before us.  The host then tried to recheck us back in and finally realized the mistake... several awkward moments later, we were finally sat.

  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and well laid out. Our server was prompt and friendly.  She explained the restaurant, the menu, and offered us several menus if we had dietary restrictions.

I ordered the beef short ribs with bacon Brussels sprouts and a side of mushrooms & onions. It would've been nice if the correct order had come out the first time, but short ribs with risotto came out.  The staff promptly fixed the order as I munched on the fantastic, well seasoned bacon brussel sprouts.  The correct order finally came out and unfortunately it was terrible.  The short rib was overcooked, bland, and missing the red wine reduction.  It tasted like Sunday pot roast, yuck.  The server ended up grabbing the manager who was happy to listen to the feedback, offered me another dish, which I declined (wasn't hungry), and then brought over a huge piece of excellent key lime pie, which my son rejoiced over. The manager ended up comping the dish, which wasn't necessary, but I did appreciate it.  

My husband's and son's dishes were excellent.  All in all, I'm adding this up to a new restaurant that just opened and they're still working out the kinks.  We will definitely go back and I hope to improve my rating of Burton's."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great for any occasion.  Been there with family several times and work a few times.  Great service every time.  Food is always amazing.  Comes out fast!  My personal favorite thing about Burton's is how they cater to people with food allergies. Anybody can find something to eat on this menu.  General Tso's Cauliflower is amazing!  I love their Super Food salad with their shrimp or salmon.  The kid's meal portions are crazy big!  My only complaint is the Shake Shack is killing the parking scene :-)"}
{"text":"With beautiful weather some friends and I decided to check out Burtons! I love the decor and interior and most of all the spacious outdoor patio. We were lucky to get one of the last tables outside. Having never been we decided to order a variety of small plates to share, great idea.

The General Tso's Cauliflower was amazing! It is crispy yet soft with an amazing Glaze. The grilled Cheese did not disappoint either. Filled, and I mean filled with pork and melted cheese. It was cooked to perfection and the fries that accompanied the sandwich were great! Finally spring rolls, again filled with meat. They definitely do not skimp on the portions so I definitely recommend ordering a few things to share.
We topped the night off with the dessert trio. 

Overall, Burton's is a great addition to Park Road Shopping Center. I definitely cannot wait to get back."}
{"text":"As I have written a review for Burtons in Boca Raton, I thought it fitting to also write one for the Burtons in Charlotte, NC.  I had to introduce my friends in Charlotte of the exceptional find I discovered in Boca and happy to know there was a local in Charlotte.  Same upscale decor and server was super.
We had Cauliflower appetizer and as awesome as the one in Boca.  My friends were impressed.  This time I had the Maple Chicken Sandwich and can highly recommend.  Not your typical chicken sandwich.  Only ate half and enjoyed the second half next day.  It actually tasted better!
Cool atmosphere and will return."}
{"text":"My wife and have eaten here 3-4 times, the first being the best and the last being the worst.
We met with her parents Friday night and requested the tuna appetizer to start with, it had been removed from the menu. It was their best app.
We ordered dinner, my mother in law and I chose the NY strip both medium rare.
I had the large and she had the small, the steaks came out 5-7 minutes later,
Mine was rare to rare and very grisly at best.
For the price they charge and what you get we will not return"}
{"text":"WINGS!!!! 

Oh my I would never have thought to come here for wings, but these were the best wings (MEMPHIS DRY RUB) ever!! Super crisp on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside. They're a bit spendy, especially for take-out, but oh delicious!!

Great place for a classy date :)"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here is good. Fried foods take up a big portion of the menu. We sat at the patio at a beautiful afternoon, so I'm sure that contributed to good review too. Maybe we ordered too much, in the end, it felt heavy. The fried calamari is pretty good. Tuna mango taco is also good. Everything also was decent but not impressive enough that I remember what I ordered, lol!"}
{"text":"Burton's is doing exactly what they set out to do (mission statement on menu) and that is to provide a chef-driven menu alongside a superior customer experience. The design is modern industrial with lots of high end finishes around. The hostess who greeted us was warm and welcoming and went and cleared us a nice booth so we didn't have to wait. The server was friendly, informative, and quick. He never seemed to be far when we needed another drink or napkin. The food itself (we got the zucchini app, crab cakes, and pork chop) was easily earning all five stars. Their version of an old fashion was good (I definitely ordered two) and a little gimmicky with the cocoa powder floating on top creating an undesirable film coating on the drink. Otherwise the whole experience was perfect. This was a great birthday dinner and we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled that such a delicious restaurant is minutes away from my front door. My date and I were headed to another restaurant on Park Road, the old faithful Italian spot- until I remembered I wanted to try Burton's. It was late Sunday evening, and there was a healthy amount of patrons having dinner and drinks. The exposed kitchen area was a nice decor choice, as was everything else.

Our server, Josie, was phenomenal and friendly. She answered any questions we had about the menu and helped me pick my appetizer selection for the evening.

We had the she crab soup, firecracker shrimp, crab stuffed haddock and the lobster shrimp pasta. I enjoyed every plate and my favorite was the pasta with a large amount of lobster pieces. I also ordered a Tangerine martini that was poured table side for me. Delicious!

It took a short while to decide what entrees to enjoy this time and which to save for the future. I can see why a few other people have eaten here repeatedly even though they've only been open for a few weeks- it's very, very good."}
{"text":"A unique take on average dishes, incredibly delicious and amazing service to top it off. Ask for Bobby, he made the meal even more enjoyable! We had the buffalo chicken dip to start - yum! Chicken risotto was good, brisket grilled cheese was AMAZING. So many great drinks to go with your meal as well! A great addition to the park road area!"}
