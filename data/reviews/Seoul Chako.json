{"text":"This place is quite fun actually! You cook your own food which is different and quite pleasant! Their deserts are good too the mango pudding was awesome! Their chicken and meat was really good too and the dragon eye sushi was really tasty! 

Down points: they brought the bills and the interac machine before we had finished eating our desserts in a way of saying get out already! And we also had to order a second time for food we never received the first time..."}
{"text":"Aww barbecue. The thing that brings family together. If you're considering having one try out the one in this restaurant. Seoul shako. Is an all you can eat place where you can order Korean style barbecue. You have the opportunity the try out the array of meats, veggies and cuisine that is being offered in the establishment. It has a party style atmosphere with dim lighting..."}
{"text":"The food is too salty and the service is terrible! Especially they directly add 15% tips without any explanation( as what I know we don't have to pay 15% if we are not over or equal 6 ) we were preparing to give tips but the waiter was rude. He dropped the plates so heavy. When we were eating they always come and ask do u finish. I guess because there were a line in front of the door.  Worst service and worst buffet! Never back!"}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is a place that you should definitely try. All you can eat BBQ and sushi! Because it's an AYCE place, the service is average because the poor waiters are always so busy. I wouldn't wear anything expensive or precious to the restaurant, as the smell of BBQ will intensely get through your clothes. 
As for the food, only some of the meats, like the beef and short ribs, are really worth your time and money as they taste the best. But, try a bit of all of them for fun, we've done that before and we liked it. The sushi is mediocre at best, but we like to get some to eat with our savoury beef to balance out the flavours. Sushi has a lot of rice in it, so don't order too much at once or you won't be able to finish them all!"}
{"text":"It's great don't get me wrong. It's just abut pricy. Expect to spend Atleast 30$ go for lunch on a week day for the best value. Go early for dinner on weekends  it gets really crowded. And don't forget to clarify if there are still things coming not not before sending out an order so you don't get any bad surprises. (:"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant on a Tuesday night!

Service: Ok, had to ask a few times to make sure we had our order. Waitress was really nice. 

Food: good, comparing to amazing in San Francisco. We were six guests... we had about everything on the menu. I recommended the Kimchi & the Edamame. All the meats were well marinated.

I would recommend this place only if you are a fan of Korean BBQ"}
{"text":"An all you can eat Korean BBQ which you grill yourself. A great experience sharing food among friends. Their system of ordering food using a tablet was very efficient. However, service is somewhat slow sometimes. Price is also a bit high. Their food really shines through and everything tasted fresh. I would come back again."}
{"text":"The food was decent.

Our service was terrible. I say 'our' service because it's only fair to note that it really was one jackass, rude waiter who spoiled the meal for the entire group of us (20!).  The manager was nice and apologetic when I told her my opinion, and she said it was her fault - which is true, in a way - they should have had more staff available.  But she was nice enough.

Our waiter, hope you don't get him! Rude, short, threw food down, argued with us, cut us off, made the dinner and paying the check as difficult as possible. 

My review would have been one star if the manager hadn't been so apologetic and made me believe a lot of our experience was because of the server, not the establishment."}
{"text":"Beware! Horrible service. We went to all you can eat lunch and if you leave meat on the plate the waiter will charge you extra at the end of lunch. The meat looked like dog food with no flavor. I left the place wanting to throw up. Never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought there was a good range of choice on the menu. The beef and chicken were good and the prawns too. The lamb didn't look that great and he calamari looked really weird and I didn't want to eat it. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was quick. Overall I thought it was pretty good and a fun way to spend an evening with friends. 

The only downside was the queue in the doorway. They need a sign saying you can go in if you have a reservation. And they will only sit you when half your group has arrived which is annoying if you've booked."}
{"text":"The best place for all you can eat Korean BBQ in Montreal. The only items that are worth raving about is the Salmon Sashimi and the BBQ Short Ribs! Everything else is a waste of space in my stomach. The service is slow, but that's normal in all-you-can eat places. value/quality versus price is off the charts if you have a large appetite like myself.

{"text":"The service was good, you just filled out what you wanted on paper and it was brought to your table within a few minutes. No hot sauce though. The food was good but there's no exhausts in the restaurant so it gets really foggy and the smell is everywere."}
{"text":"the idea of korean BBQ is good but I think it's overpriced, the menu is not diverse enough, (not for the price we are paying 40$ for a friday night), the two time I went there my stomach felt weird afterward, i wasnt sure if it was me who didnt cook the food well or because something is weird with their food or the cooking surface which seems not so clean. We asked the waitress to change it and she had such a bad attitude...anyways not really recommending this place"}
{"text":"Great food , all you can est korean style but long line ups sometimes to have a table. Better to call to reserve a table"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! The waitor lost our second round of orders, he wouldnt bring us water or even napkins. The beef is really good though..."}
{"text":"Since this is Montreal, I didn't have high expectations for Korean bbq, but I wanted to give this place a try cus my friends here were so curious about it. The marinade was definitely not Korean....more like Chinese diluted to adhere to the typical sweetness of western food. It tasted cheap. I advise people to get drunk so you can forget about the bland taste and just keep eating. As I looked around, I felt bad for the people who are eating this, thinking this is actually Korean. I gave it one more star only because the price is relatively cheap: but remember that you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"First, Seoul Chako is pricey. It costs more for dinner than for lunch but you get a much bigger selection as well as a friendlier staff if you're willing to wait and pay more. 

It is mainly a place to socialize with a group of friends. It gets noisy at times but it's about what you would expect at a BBQ. Also, the restaurant is usually rather full and the waiters might take a while to notice you. The food itself is nothing to rave about, but they offer a nice selection of a bit of everything. For meat lovers, the short ribs and white fish are particularly delicious. The food can burn quickly so it is especially important to change the grill every so often when it starts to stick. 

Overall, it's a good place to fill your stomach with meat and chat with friends."}
{"text":"After reading some bad critics, I wasn't expecting much. But I was still very disappointed.

Cons:
- Service is bad. They are not polite, just throw the food on your table, not a single nice word.
- Atmosphere is bad. Only kids and young adults around 20 there. It feels like a high school canteen. 
- Food is terrible. Everything has a taste of burnt plastic. Probably the oil they use on the grill? Rests of soap? I can't even tell. The food itself is almost not seasoned so this plastic taste isn't even hidden by anything. 
- Price. 36$ for 1 coke and all-I-could-eat. Super expensive for the overall quality of the restaurant.

Pros: 
- It's fun to cook your meat yourself. For 5 minutes. Then it's just getting annoying.

tldr; never going back there. Even if it was free."}
{"text":"I've been to authentic Korean BBQ restaurants in Vancouver and this one was nothing like it. The meat is nothing special and service was okay. I liked the food but for the price I did not have what I expected to have. They also have no Korean drinks and the offer ending at 10:30pm and the other one starting at 11pm is not clear and not client friendly. You will enjoy the sushi and having to cook your meat but not worth your money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Selection of food was tasty. Do keep a special lookout for the lamb and selected beef (to die for). For dessert you HAVE to try the litchi jello! I had about 5 of them lol :) My only caviar is that the service could be improved slightly."}
{"text":"I've been to better Korean bbq but you get what you pay for. The food is still good so it's my go to place to eat. The service is ok."}
{"text":"The food is nice, there's no doubt I will always be a fan of their meat, but it is unfortunate to say that the service there is mediocre. 1) None of the staff speak french. 2) sometimes you have to wait firever after your first order and at the end there's missing pieces. The waiters just want you to leave, they have the worst service ever. I'm giving a 3/5 star for the food, but If I could rate the service, it will be a big zero out if 5."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, again lol

They opened recently, it's an all you can eat korean bbq place. The service is a bit dodgy so expect to wait a bit so don't go if you're in a rush.

When we were there they had some problems with the ventilation, so expect to smell when you leave.

The place looks nice, the tables all have a gas fire pit in the middle, so you can cook your food right at the table, it's closer to the way we see it in other major cities.

Montreal is a bit behind the trend concerning korean food, compared to TO, Vancouver and NYC...  but this place will bring us closer.

Like all Korean bbq places in mtl you get a few side dishes, always kim chi, bean sprouts, stewed potatoes and some sea weed, daicon pickles, fried tofu... that's about 6 sides which is more than usual, i think the average is about 3 usually in mtl, so on that point, that's good.

of the sides, the potatoes are quite good, the rest are just average. There are over 20 sides that I've come to know, so we are far behind. I once was served 14 sides in NYC, just the sides alone filled me up that time...

On to the food, you basically order by the type of meat you want. On this point there is quite a bit to choose from, you have chicken, lamb, beef, beef short rib, pork, shrimp (with head and peel), fish, squid, sausage, veggies. nb: bbq shrimp should be had with head and peel, the flavor is deeper and the shrimp stays moist once cooked. You should at least suck on the head if you don't want to eat it. I eat the whole thing from head to tail, and I like it, it's a bit of an acquired taste, but if you peel the shrimp it will taste quite unsatisfying since it will taste bland like boiled shrimp...

The meat comes in small portions, usually 2-3 pieces. Which is good since you can order a wide variety and reorder what you like after... We tried the beef, beef short rib, squid, shrimp, fish, sausage and some veggies. I strongly recommend the short rib!!! I was quite impressed with it, it was fresh and the cut is quite thick, I'd say about half an inch thick cooked. it was tender and juicy. very nice, i've never had it quite so thick but I like it. (update feb 2012, the thickness is less but still thicker than other places)

We didn't try any chicken or pork because my friend wasn't so keen on it, but i wish we had, I want to try it!!! you can also order rice with your order if you want.

The menu also offers, some starters like miso soup and salads and edamame, and a variety of sushi rolls.

The starters are nice, nothing impressive but they do enhance the experience. The sushi is standard also, however the fish is quite fresh. I'm really impressed with the freshness of the meats and fish in this place, considering it's 21.99 $ per person all you can eat!!! (23.99 friday to sunday)

My one problem is they don't bring out the dipping sauce with the meat, we had to ask them for it. When we got the sauce, it turned out to be gochuchang, which is Korean hot paste. Traditionally, they eat korean bbq with bean paste, this I find strange that they offer gochuchang, but in any case I always eat my bbq with gochuchang so I'm not complaining :)

Also usually proper Korean bbq is accompanied with raw garlic and sliced jalapenos and scallions for you to grill, all 3 are absent here, sadly I didn't bother to ask so no idea if they even have it on demand... Another standard item missing here is lettuce, peculiarly enough, lettuce is available to order for an additional 1.50$ what the? really, you are gonna milk me for lettuce?

The traditional way to eat korean bbq is to wrap it in the lettuce, inside you put the meat, garlic, scallions and whatever other sides you wish to put in like pickled radish and kim chi. So on this point, no this is not a comprehensive Korean bbq service, but then again, none of the places in mtl are... but taste wise it is good, and I like it. 

as a side note, I really wish we get a real Korean bbq joint where they use wood charcoal in the pit instead of gas. You get much better heat distribution and a nicer char on the meat, plus the bbq flavor really comes out. so if you happen to find a place like that anywhere you should try it :)

we ended with some ice cream, nothing special but nice to have something to cleanse your palate with, it's not persimmon tea but hey let's not ask for too much at once...
So on the strength of the meat quality, the price/quality ratio, side dish variety and advancing the Korean bbq scene in mtl, I give it 4 stars (compared to other mtl bbq places) even though my korean friends would curse me lol. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service is indeed slow and they often forget to bring you certain things you have ordered. Outside of that, I like the restaurant. You pay 30 bucks (with taxes) and can eat a lot of good food that you cook yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and they have consistently forgotten our orders. We even waited for 30 minutes last time when they asked us to leave without serving us. 

In addition, the waitress will make a scene about being badly tipped so I kindly explained that it's the second time we waited over 30 mins for our orders because the waitress for our orders again...it may be cheap but you can't expect good service. 
Lower your expectations and you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"NOT Korean BBQ. Real Korean BBQ has free side dishes and don't charge extra for kimchi and wraps. This place will never change the grill unless you ask them to, and they'll forget. A real kbbq joint will always know when change your grill. Great if you just wanna eat an enormous amount of eat, but don't call it kbbq. Also, it is run by Chinese people that own the Tokyo sushi across the street.

- A Korean"}
{"text":"The raw food were prepared great but with poor explanation and very poor service. 
We arrived at 10:30and been told we only can do last shot so why not we were fine and glad to obey the rule.
However they gave us the bill which we paid immediately before all food delivered except the deserts and ask for tips twice! How horrible someone kept asking for your money! I said I will leave it on the table.. And they just kept ask for that!!!! How creepy! 
I will not recommend to anyone who want to enjoy his/her dinner or lunch . 

FYI they served DIY BBQ so you have to cook it yourself I am fine with that cause I am from canton. But I felt confused the time I walked in . No one tell me what s going on there! I thought it s a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for a birthday dinner or a romantic date. If you have kids I wouldn't go there as it's more an adult place. 

The fish is very fresh and all the sides are great. Although it's not a japanese place, their sushi are pretty good.

The staff is a bit rude but I didn't really pay attention to it as you just tell them what you want and they go away and come back with it without really saying anything. Took them a while to fill up our water glasses.

Would go again anytime."}
{"text":"Very overrated and overpriced

This is not korean food guys. A lot of thing are missing for it to be a korean retaurent. It is basically a grill your meat and veggies. And it is overpriced for the meal you eat. They dont even use the same type of meat korean bbq use.(where is the samgyupsal abd the chadolbaeki?_aka the basics).... but at least they use fresh ingredients (sometimes). The owner is chinese so theres a lot of chinese influences that i spotted.. like the dressings and sauces and marinades do not taste korean (salty and spicy) but sweet and sour like chinese food. Or maybe americanized korean food? Idk ... i hope this is not what non korean people think this is korean food."}
{"text":"Great food good service, super nice waitress (Ariel). Must eat here great experience."}
{"text":"I went 3 times, 1st time was good, the grill n everything awsm. 2nd n 3rd times weren't. ...friendly. waiters were unpleasant. They don't smile, not attentive. Don't like to have any conversation. Orders took long to serve. I don't enjoy food if it's not served with care n love. I complined, it seems to be a normal thing for them. 

Wat I didn't like about the place : not spacious, not well ventilated , not many tables with windos.suffocating, narrow between tables, so noisy. Expensive. Not Cleane. 

I love the grill do it ur selves. Many items to choose from . 
I will not go back ,didn't feel welcomed,wish the staffs were more friendly, little bit more spacious ,if were not too noisy,well ventilated,"}

{"text":"Mmmmm Korean BBQ:) I first discovered it while living in  LA and I took to it instantly!

Ahh the aroma of chargrilled meat, tender, marinated, smoky perfection dipped in spicy, tasty sauces, definitely one of my favorites:)

I fiound Seoul Chako by chance and what a discovery it was!

I was on my way to Grummun 78 to pick up a few tacos and was lucky enough to find parking a block away. As I got out of my car, the heavenly smell of charcoaled meat grabbed my attention, I looked around to see where it was coming from and right infront of my car was Seoul Chako.

They had a little terasse outside which was packed with people grilling their meat so I decided to check out the menu at the front door which mentioned an all you can eat lunch time buffet.

I'm not really a buffet girl, although I love food, I don't eat a ton but the smell and my memories of korean BBQ made me go in.

The host told me that the lunch time buffet ended at 3pm, it was now 2:30, so he said that I would only be able to order once.

I sat down at a table, my centre piece grill was lit and he gave me my little form to fill out my choices

For 13.99$ you get your pick of a variety of cuts of beef, chicken and shrimp is also on the menu.

A few salads, sushi and green tea of mango ice cream for desert.

I have always had eyes bigger then my mouth and suddenly I felt starved. I asked my waiter how much meat was on a plate and he said 4 pieces, which didn;t sound like much. 

I ordered 2 plates of meat, a plate of chicken, 2 bowls of rice, a California roll, a salad and a vegetable plate. 

I paid my bill in advance, I am not  really a patient type of girl, once I'm done eating, I like to run.

I then started reading through the menu again and saw a note at the bottom saying, do not waste food, you will be charged a 1$ for each wasted piece,

hmmmmmm....maybe I was a little greedy and piggish and ordered a little too much? 

Within a few minutes my waiter is back with a scary amount of food!


4 plates of meat, yes 4, not the 2 I ordered, a plate of chicken, 2 rice bowls, sushi and salad and me in a booth....

I started slinking down in my seat, feeling very piggish, how the hell am I going to eat all this??

That thought was quickly cast aside and I started digging

 into my meal....

I arranged some meat, onions and mushrooms on my grill and started on my little salad..

A pretty simple one but fresh, crisp chunks of lettuce with a tasty dressing, nothing special but still good.

The sushi was your typical California roll, I had one piece then pushed it aside,

Back to my meat....In a nuthshell, melt in your mouth goodness, rich, well marinated with just the right amount of marbling to make it delicious!

After finishing one plate of meat and rice, I started feeling nervous, I cannot eat all this and I cannot just leave it all on the table!

There was a group of guys behind me eating, who just asked the waiter for more meat but it was past 3, so no meat for you:)

I popped my head over and asked them, do you guys want my meat? They gave me a weird look but said yes.

My table was still overloaded and I was stuffed, so I cooked the rest and decided to bring it home to my shih tzu.


My stomach was full but I was in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered the mango ice cream, to finish things off:)

It came within a few minutes,  a perfect little portion in a cute little square bowl,

Sweet, fruity, creamy goodness, great finish to all the meat.

All in all, a delicious treat, I will be back, this time with company:)"}

You pay for the food and the service just remember that.
I never complain about anything in life, but I must admit I was really upset about this because the manager was trying to blame me for I don't know what reason.. I guess for making a reservation at their restaurant. 
Never again"}

{"text":"I thought I was going to a club when I first saw the line-up, it was pretty big for a restaurant. Which is a good sign in my opinion. For the food I honestly would not recommend fish or chicken,they tend to get stuck on the pan and it's annoying. The best choice would be meat and sushi. The seasoning in their meat is great. The tip is already included in the bill which is weird and you have to pay for anything you couldn't eat so watch out for that. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place and I go occasionally."}

I don't understand all this negative reviews about this place. They might not be the friendliest people on earth, but you definitely will leave this place satisfied! Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"First off, i want to start by mentionning that i went here for lunch around 2pm ! Apparently its very different from dinner. Nonetheless i somewhat like it, here`s the gist : Fun & classy deco with comfortable dinner type/lounge benches - big wide tables & cool blueish/eclectic lighting .
 
How it works : you sit down, look at the menu & write down on a little note pad available to you on the table with pencils, the number of the item of foods you want & their quantity. Example : Lets say grilled beef is numer 15 on the menu, you write down 15 & next to it 1 or 2 depending on the portion you want !
You can choose a variety of meats, vegetables & entrees such as samosas , spring rolls & sushis . There is also desserts , i had some mango ice cream , it was great ! However i felt like their wasnt enough variety, your typical beef, pork or chicken , some vegetables & a select few entrees...but i was told it was for the lunch menu & that for dinner, it was much more complete with things like sea food & many other vegetables addded. 
All in all the food had great taste & it was fun to grill it yourself while chatting up with a friend, the meats cooked pretty quickly , and i like mine very well cooked not bloody at all.

So i'm defnitely curious to go back for Dinner. Oh also, i went there with a friend but i think it would be much more fun as a group ! 

Only down side was that i felt a little rushed by the waiters & they seemed pretty hyper & in a hurry. But i later found out that it was because the restaurant closes from 3 to 5 i think, to switch from lunch to dinner time. Still it made the experience less enjoyable"}
{"text":"Service: Great, efficient, water is refilled frequently, and they change your grilling plate upon request; however it'll be great if the waitress was a tad friendlier.

Food: amazing, the lamb slices (Fri-Sun only) and ox tongue are must-try. The miso soup is not very salty, so one can enjoy the actual taste of miso paste. The cold dishes are delicious, I recommend the kimchi and the bean sprout.

The pork bone soup I had was somehow sour (probably spoiled), and the seaweed salad did not taste good at all.

The ice cream were wonderful. However their lychee jelly tasted like lemonade with gelatin...

I would recommend this place only if you are a fan of Korean BBQ, since the price is a little bit high."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time a couple of days ago with my husband. We arrived around 6h00 and we had to wait for a table. Luckily it was quite fast. 

We ordered a good portion and started to eat. They served us two cups of water but the water was almost luke warm so I asked for some ice.  It never came. Asked 3 times and eventually my husband had to go directly at the bar and asked for it. The overall service  is fast. Once you give them the paper for your order your things arrives quite fast since they probably already portioned most of their food in advance. But dont expect a good service, you give them the paper they bring you the food and it stops there. There is no interaction as in askimg us if everything  is okay. As simple as the ice incident when we told our waitress she simply said ok and forgot about it. 

What saved them is the fact that the food is not bad. Their meat is marinated and is decent, they also have a few selection of sushi  which is great also if ever you crave sushi with your meat. I personally wouldn't  call it authentic. But for the variety of the menu, im not complaining. 

Would probably go back

Tips : if possibly put your coat or any outwear you may have (cardigan, hoodie) in your bag. Or else you will smell like smoke, their ventilation system is not so great."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Took long for servers to take orders. Waiters were not attentive. Glasses were empty. No one even paid attention. And difficult to flag anyone down to get a refill. Waiter used his hands to fill glass with ice and when an ice cube fell on the counter he picked it right back up and placed it in a cup. Many items that were ordered weren't brought to the table. They even ran out of food. How do you even run out of chicken?? You're a restaurant that is all you can eat. Beware they tacked on a 15% service charge for their LACK of service. And we were not a group."}
{"text":"I think Korean bbq just hasn't caught on here yet. For an all you can eat restaurant the quality of the meat was fantastic. Sapporo pitchers are reasonably priced and the service was excellent, our multi lingual waiter Sam was a breath of fresh air and super attentive.  I am a fan of this place. My only suggestion, get garlic!!! Lol If there was garlic I would have given an extra star."}
{"text":"I went to Seoul Chako yesterday with my girlfriend during lunch hour. Normally 13.99, we had student discounts that reduced the price to 10 dollars. 

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were there, I'd say 3-4 other patrons at the most (keep in mind this is a hot Thursday noon).  

AMBIANCE:
Top-notch. This is a very new restaurant, and the interior design and amnesties show that. Each table has their own grill, and it's a very high-tech one at that. They have their own inbuilt ventilation system that takes away the messiness and teary eyes usually associated with grilling your own food. 

SERVICE:
Quick and professional, though i wasn't particularly used to the way we ordered the food. Unlike similar asian buffet restaurants such as Tokyo/Kanda/Crescent sushi,  you don't write your order down on a piece of paper; instead the waiter comes around every so often to take your order. As a result we had to order food 3 times, a needless stress really. 

FOOD:
Here is where Seoul Chako falls a bit short. In one word, food is SALTY. Everything from the meat, to the soups, to the sushi. I had to down 2 glasses of water during the meal. Beef is definitely the highlight on the menu, it is tender and tasty. Short ribs were hard to cook, and overly fatty. The chicken and octopus were way too salty for my liking. 

Sushi is also served here, though they aren't as good as Tokyo Sushi across the street. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this to any students who can get their hands on coupons (and man are they plentiful). Worth it for 10 bucks, not sure whether or not the normal priced lunch/dinner would be as good as a deal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean grill in Montreal. Mmmmm.. We come here at least twice a month if not more. 

So, let's break it down.

It's an all-you-can-eat BBQ

You cook your own food

You can pick between a bunch of different meats and seafood

But, it doesn't stop there!

There's sushi....there are salads....there's edemame....there are raw veggies.....there are fries....and there's ice cream! How can you go wrong?!

The waiters are always happy

The food is super duper fresh

And did I mention that it's an all-you-can-eat BBQ????

In all seriousness though, the food really is quite good here.. Well marinated and well cut. The only thing I'm really not a fan of here is the chicken.. But that's just because of the marinade. Other than that, my mouth is totally watering and I wish it wasn't close to midnight so I could run over there and devour everything on that menu right now!

Go check it out, and please don't go if you have to be somewhere important after. Why?? Because you will stink like BBQ.......for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the service. Why would you when you have a ton of delicious food to grill?? The servers are basically only there to bring you the food you order. Sometimes you may have to ask them for an order they forgot or may not have but let's focus on the experience.
We went for dinner on a weekday and it came up to about $33 all in. For that price you're able to order an array of meat, fish and veggies to grill (all seem to be great small portion cuts). Included as well are an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi, appetizers and desserts!
You won't feel rushed while enjoying grilling your slightly marinated meats (use the soy sauce for  more flavour) and you will definitely get your fill.
Great idea for date nights or with friends!"}
{"text":"Great service, the all you can eat specials are amazing for lunch and dinner.  The lunch special lets you have sushi and all you can eat korean bbq for something like 12-15 dollars - and the beef short ribs are AMAZING."}
{"text":"Humm c'est un endroit assez populaire, le concept est cool MAIS ! le service est boff, les serveurs sont souvent très fatigués, stressés et nerveux (sans emotions). Même si le service a été mauvais et lent, ils incluent d'avance le pourboire de 15% sur votre facture (vol). La nourriture est souvent sèche et mal assaisonné. Pour environ 30$, vous en avez assez pour votre argent. Les plaques de BBQ sont souvent sales avec de la nourriture brûlé par dessus."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant mais pas excellent, prix un peu élevé (30$ pour un all you can eat en fin de semaine, en  semaine et pour le lunch c'est moins cher). 

Bon service, bonne nourriture, à essayer au moins une fois.

Il faut manger tout ce qu'on commande sinon il vont vous charger 1$ par morceau non mangé !


English : Good restaurant, a bit expensive (30$ on weekend, i think it's cheaper weekday and lunch time).

Good service, good food try it at least once.

You have to eat it all or they'll charge 1$ for every piece left !"}
{"text":"Worst organization ever
After waiting 1.5 hours , they stopped taking walkins and only reservations only so we waited an extra 45m (106 people ahead of us). They don't accept reservations under 6

After all this the food was okay at best.
Pass"}
{"text":"I've tried many different Korean BBQS. This one is probably in the less good range. Its not bad exactly but its abit bland. The marinade for the meats was all pretty similar. The quality of the meat was good though. The sushi was pretty good. The one thing that stood out form the other Korean BBQS are the takoyakis. I've never seen them in another AYCE place. That was a nice surprise although they but ketchup on them which was really weird. Appart from that the service was acceptable and relatively quick.
Honestly Sota right across the street is much better."}
{"text":"I really have to be on my best behavior when I enter the maws of a Korean restaurant. That means no Kim Jong Un jokes, no saying \"Seouru Chak?-o\" with an affected accent. No jokes about eating dogs, cats or other assorted household pets.

The fact is Seoul Chako has consistently provided very decent quality in the most convenient of locations at a decent price.

You could ask for more, I'm not sure you'll get it though.

Their sauces are tasty, their beef is tasty, that's the key. This is a Korean BBQ place. If you're ordering sushi here, you're doing it wrong.

The service is totally hit or miss. Either complete rubbish or awesome depending who you get. Seems to be the case for places run by Hong Kong expats."}
{"text":"Absolutely luv this place it's like a second home to me and my girl. 
If we can't decide we default to this place. Sake is cheep and good too!"}
{"text":"Went here with family and the food tasted good but it wasn't anything special. First experience at a Korean BBQ restaurant and honestly, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. Not because it was all bad, just because I wasn't impressed. 

The staff was polite and nice, but water never got refilled (they only refilled out water after at least an hour of us being there). MANY of our orders were neglected and never came, so we had to reorder a second time only because we were missing most of our items. Price seemed fair considering it's an all-you-can-eat. 

My biggest issue was cleanliness. The table was not cleaned, or not very well at least. As we walked to our table we passed by the bar and lounge area that was a complete mess, with boxes and glass racks stacked against the wall everywhere, which is unexpected from this type of space and restaurant. Many of the food pieces would stay stuck on the grill as it was not non-stick. 

Overall I made the best of the experience, but unless your tastes aren't particularly perfect, I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"The worst service ever, the grill and table were completely unclean. I was hesitant to try the sushi due to how unsanitary the place looked."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about! Seoul Chako way surpassed my expectations.

The meat was absolutely delicious, so juicy and tender and the selection is amazing! The ox tongue is my favourite for anyone daring enough to try (one thing however is that I kept ordering the octopus and it never showed up both times I've been there, perhaps they should take this off the menu)

On top of the meats they offer to BBQ yourself, there is also a good selection of delicious sushi, grill-able vegetables and Korean appetizers to choose from. 

For dessert definitely try a round of strawberry forzen yogurt with vanilla icecream. And then get their mango pudding."}
{"text":"For the price, what you're getting is really great. All you can eat decent sushi and meats. The cooking plates are pretty good, and I really like their beef. The sweet potato roll is also very good.

Come on friday thru Sunday for the desert bar. However ice cream is always served through the week.

My one problem here is that the servers are very slow to respond sometimes. You write your orders down on a piece of paper, very standard, but they hardly come around to pick it up. I always have to waive a guy down."}
{"text":"Ok food, terrible service. They got the order wrong and gave us way more than we ordered, in the end when we found out and checked our order sheet, the waitress pretty much said \"yeah but you should told me at the beginning, so now you need to pay for my mistake\""}
{"text":"Suuuuuuuuuper  meat meat everywhere meeenn Séoul chako is the best la viande est tendre fond dans la bouche les legumes son frais cocktail martini litchi on fleeeek lol"}
{"text":"The selection isn't the best I've had in terms of Korean BBQ, however, what you do get tastes quite good! I ordered plenty of shrimp, fish, beef and chicken. The vegetables I ordered weren't the freshest so they came out quite dry, apart from that, the menu doesn't deliver numerous options like other (better) Korean BBQ places do (especially my favorite one on Monkland). Nonetheless, if you're in the downtown area and in the mood for a 30$ all you can eat Korean BBQ, give it a taste! Maybe you'll like it, maybe it'll be average."}
{"text":"I went to this place several times and was never disappointed. The marinate on the meat is good and there is a decent variety of items to choose from. I would recommend the beef and pork as they are the one that cook the fastest. Overall I think the ratings are too harsh on the all you can eat korean barbecue as I felt like the food and the service were decent. Fair prices, a good choice if you want a huge amount of meat."}
{"text":"This place do have great food! The short ribs are great. I would admit that when you do order they all come out in really small portions. So if you do go then double the order, because their costumer service sucks! After our first order they never came back to check on us. It wasn't even busy! I understand if it was, but they didn't have much customers and none of them smile! We had to flag them down every time we wanted something. Also, when we wanted to order more stuff they didn't come out with all our orders. We were missing a few! Other than that the food IS good and the ice cream as well. If you do go to this place, make sure to double the order!"}
{"text":"Great Korean barbecue and good sushi. Come early it fills up quickly.
This is an all you can eat. You order dishes and cook them on the grill in the middle of the table. They also serve sushi though this is not the principle attraction. If you want just sushi you will be better served elsewhere. Ambiance is good, though loud.
Enjoy, I have several times."}
{"text":"Very uneven. Concept is interesting and BBQ is good. Sushi are tasteless at best as they have been made several hours before. Service is horrendous as most waiters seem not to care about customers."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this restaurant for years and finely gave in and went with my
Friend.

At first we were seated on the side leading to the kitchen it looked dirty so we asked to be moved to better seat.

24.99 unlimited food sounds like the real deal and it is just depending on what you like. Personally the cooking part is cool but it does take work. The best meat was beef rib most flavour and best quality. Shrimp I found bland and no flavour, same
For the chicken and beef slices. I asked for some sort of sauce all they had was spicy stuff untill one of my orders came the fried dumplings. The plum sauce is what I was dipping most my food in because lack of taste.

It was a great experience but I don't think the food was that great. But a pitcher of Sapporo 16 bucks can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Un des plus réputé bbq coréen de Montréal. Toujours beaucoup de monde et beaucoup de bruit (il faut s'y attendre).
Je trouve les prix un peu chers, je sais bien que c'est un all you can eat mais souvent dans les groupes, il y a des filles ou des gens végé qui mangent moins, ça finit par leur revenir cher. Prix un peu élevés aussi pour les enfants, 9$ pour les moins de 4 ans et 20$ pour les 5 à 12 ans... je trouve ça beaucoup...
Service de base, pas spécialement aimable
Bouffe bonne et fraiche
Attention de ne pas gaspiller sinon on vous chargera 1$ par pièce gaspillée!"}
{"text":"Ahhh the disappointment! Anyone who knows Korean BBQ knows that the meat must be served with lettuce in order to make your wrap that consists of meat and rice. It's part of the dish. Seoul Chako likes to charge extra for lettuce! I can't believe it! That's like going to an Italian restaurant and ordering a plate of pasta but getting charged extra for the tomato sauce. I don't understand how they can serve a dish but charge you extra to enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The quality of the meat isn't the greatest either. The waiters are arrogant and the place in itself is pretty disorganized. I don't think I saw my waiter smile once the entire evening. 

If you want really good Korean BBQ, the way it's supposed to be served and enjoyed, hit up Shabu Shabu on St. Jacques in N.D.G. It's 10x better."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're a group. There's a communal aspect to the eating experience as you share a grill with your friends. We went for a friend's birthday party: the staff was very pleasant and offered to cut and plate the cake. 
I'm not a big meat eater, but their beef cuts were to die for. If you're not a big fan of beef, you have a variety of other choices: white fish, shrimp, chicken, lamb (on Friday and weekends), squid, and so on. Vegetables and tofu are available for vegetarians, but this is definitely not a place where meat-abstinence is celebrated. Everything comes compartmentalized in cute black stackable bowls that are easy to pass around for everyone to dig in. 
Other choices include fried scallops, which looked somewhat cheap with a dot of plain mayo on each piece. Fried calamari reminds you that this is an all-you-can eat.
The mango ice cream tasted gritty, the flavour somewhat reminded me of penicillin. Green tea ice cream was okay."}
{"text":"Seoul Chako is one of these places I've been to many times, and liked less and less.
When I came to Montreal, I thought it was great, mainly because I never had Korean BBQ. 
It was a great place to grab dinner with friends, especially if they never really had Korean BBQ either. The food was on average acceptable, but not very authentic (the owners are Chinese). After a visit or two, I already knew to avoid certain meat cuts, and to stick to a few crowd favorites (and also that my clothes would smell of BBQ for days). 

One downside is the lack of vegetables. There's not much except mushrooms, bell pepper and zucchini. Another weakness is the service. They are usually understaffed, and it's difficult to get serviced sometimes. They also tend to bring incomplete orders or, at worst, to forget them altogether. As with other all you can eat places such as Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, it's safer to order everything you want to eat on the first order. Otherwise, I haven't had many bad experiences at Seoul Chako over the years, although I did find a dead ant in my mango jelly once (the staff promptly apologized and brought me a new one).

There are certainly more authentic and better quality Korean BBQ in town (e.g. Chez Hwang). But if you're looking for a loud, cheap-ish, straightforward place to eat a lot of meat, then I guess Seoul Chako is okay."}
{"text":"I liked the food a lot but the service needs to improve a bit more to get that fifth star."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Name of restaurant does not live up to what they serve.I don't think it's even Korean bbq .They marinate the meat in some simple way, a bit tasteless actually,  that is not typically Korean I find. Korean bbq marinated meat.... It's usually a bit sweet and packs a lot more flavor. The fried dumplings were actually quite terrible, the filling was mushy inside and had a bad texture. And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant. Atmosphere was close to high-end, the walls changed colors....reminded me a bit of a club, Anyway I would not pay 21.99$ for this kind of food. I'd prefer to pay the lunch price which is 13.99$."}
{"text":"Really had been looking forward to this place opening. All you can eat Korean BBQ at a great price with excellent service. I suggest evening as lunch menu is limited. definitely very fun meal if you go with a group!!!!"}
{"text":"Service moyennement amical mais rapide. Tu t'en sors avec environs 35$ sans pourboire ni consommations mais c'est à volonté donc bon..."}
{"text":"Good service, waiter is very polite. Food came in very quickly after you order. Bbqing is great!! It's great to go there with friends, cooking and chit chatting at the same time. If there's a line up, it can be very long. Make sure to trek your name and #of people you're with to the waitress inside (she holds a list with her at all times)"}
{"text":"The staff was a little rude. But I guess they were trying to go home. The staff is friendly and the food is awesome great sized portions loved it!!!!! It was my first time to Canada so this place was the bomb. I loved it I ate so much!! I would definitely come back, & highly recommend trying this place out. :) they also have a bar and the drinks looked really good! I showed up kinda of late so the bar closed at 1030 so I didn't get to try any but most def next time! I'm coming back by the end of January, maybe I'll come here with my Canada bf"}
{"text":"It was absolutely amazing. Such a large variety of options. The all you can eat was pretty cheap as well. The all you can eat included sushi and Korean bbq as well as desserts. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Les restaurants de BBQ Coréen à volonté ne sont pas légions à Montréal et nous avons essayé celui-ci à l'insistance d'amis qui avaient bien apprécier leur visite antérieure.

Seoul Chako n'a rien pour épater les connaisseurs de cuisines coréenne. Le choix d'entrées et de viandes est relativement limité. En plus, il n'ont pas de Soju ce qui, pour moi, est inacceptable dans un restaurant coréen!

Le service \"à volonté\" du midi est offert à un prix fort raisonnable de $13.99 (moins 10% de rabais en début de semaine) mais n'inclus pas la laitue... Qu'à cela ne tienne, je préfère de beaucoup manger le BBQ coréen à la coréenne en enveloppant la viande dans la feuille de laitue et en ajoutant les condiments. Déception cependant puisque pour un supplément de 1.50$ on nous a servi de la laitue \"iceberg\" qui n'est pas très approprié pour envelopper la viande.

Contrairement aux restaurants coréens traditionnels, ici on ne vous sert pas la série de \"banchan\" (petits plats d'accompagnement), vous devez les commander individuellement et la sélection est limitée à 4 choix (heureusement, cela inclus le Kimchi!).

Les plats sont généralement petits, ce qui exige d'en commander plus (pas un grand problème, puisque c'est à volonté!).

Autrement, le service étais courtois et l'atmosphère agréable et porteuse à la discussion."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav Korean bbq place..Mmm all you can eat :) I'm happy.  Weekend tends to be really busy now and long wait.  You can call for reservations now I believe.  They finally have soju after asking 50mil times.  Customer service is great.  They change the grill when i ask them.  One time they accidentally spilled on me but they made it up with a bottle of soju..I'm happy to drink..sure! Thanks will come again :) Yes, you have to cook/grill your own food otherwise learn or don't come. It's a good experience."}
{"text":"Great selection, great concept! For a fixed price you can order as much and as frequently as you want. Portions are small, which is ok since you can re-order as often as desired. This minimizes waste when serving those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs! Meat is brought raw for you to cook at your table.  Ingredients are fresh. Service was good and servers were attentive. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"A good Koran BBQ restaurant and conveniently located in the downtown core. The service is fast but they are always line ups at the restaurant during the week ends after 6pm and fridays too."}
{"text":"I could've given a 5 starts but the customer service was horrible. I was trying to be nice and even tried to make jokes to lighten up the mood, but he didn't want nothing from that. I understand that we need to pay 15% but the way our waiter spoke to us was disrespectful. Our waiter yesterday night was not listening to us and took really long to bring our ice cream at the end of the night. 
There are ways to explain the rules of the restaurant to customers in a respectful way. I really didn't want to give the tip but we had no choice apparently."}
{"text":"Restaurant à sushi et barbecue coréen très bon des portions correct et très bonne ! Par contre si vous voulez manger tranquillement n'allait pas la bas ... du bruit, du bruit, du bruit, les serveurs ramassent les plats et les déposent dans sur un chariot, bref je vous passe les détails . Après comme je vous dis nourriture très bonne, personnellement je n'y retournerai pas"}
{"text":"One of the worst Korean foods I've ever had in my life. It's likely owned by non-Korean.  The meats were very low quality and you have to ask to have the grill switched.  The fire is too strong that the meat gets burned too quickly before getting cooked.  You also receive food you didn't order - especially deep fried and sushi that seemed like it was on the fridge and they just re-heated.  The service was also horrible as they never came by and I had to bring water on the counter myself for my friend.  STAY AWAY!!!

Food: 1/5 (watery meat in small portions so if you decide to go, order more - the spareribs and beef were very fatty and too much cartilage) 

Service: 1/5 (you have to ask them to switch the grill which is horrible for a Korean BBQ as they should do it often so you don't get char on all your meats - if your meat is not marinated well, the sauce will burn on the grill and create more char) 

Ambience: 2/5 (it's loud and not well ventilated at all so very smokey)

Price: 1/5 (way too expensive almost $30 per person for very poor food and service)"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews, but I thought I should give it a chance. I went here with my family, and we should have listened to the reviews. First, it's expensive. Second, they don't serve authentic korean food. To top it all of, the service is horrible. Orders were missing, and we asked some waiter for help and he said I'm not your waiter look for your waiter. The meat selection was horrible, and the meat didn't even taste good. I expected better quality or at least better service for the price they charge. Do yourself a favor and look for any other restaurant

TL;DR

Cons:
-meat selection
-service
-food quality
-taste

Pros:
-TBD"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of Korean bbq option in the area. Don't expect too much from here. Just a typical place. Decent food decent service and honesty they do need to work on the cleaning the table properly."}
{"text":"Seoul Chako claims to serve korean BBQ but everything is extremely westernized and generic. They are the perfect example of a place that boosts quantity/variety over quality and even though nothing tastes bad, do you really want to spend money on something that's just meh? Prices are not cheap either (expect around $30 night time and even more on weekends). 

The restaurant is quite large and can accommodate large group of people."}
{"text":"Not sure why the lack of love for this place but I'm glad I followed my friend's recommendation for this place. A HUGE hit with the whole family for a very reasonable price.

Yes, its an AYCE Korean BBQ, but with lots to choose from. We really enjoyed the salmon, the beef, and definitely the pork belly.  Even the picky eaters in the group ate everything. Add to that the dumplings and the sides you can get, and this place was a big winner.  

Loved cooking it ourselves and we walked right in on a Wednesday evening without a reservation. Service was prompt and efficient.

The right food for the right price! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Premièrement je dois vous dire que j'y ai été de reculons. Les photos ne sont pas fameuses ni inspirantes et les commentaires n'étaient pas très constant, donc un peu inquiète. Mais celà dit, j'ai pas eu de choix car c'était pour l'anniversaire de ma nièce. Agréablement surprise !!! C'était vraiment bon! Le concept est plaisant,le service rapide et croyez moi c'était plein à craquer. Sushis bien présenté  et bons, semblaient très frais et propre et c'est ce que craignait le plus, la fraîcheur et surtout poisson cru dans les sushis... et bien j'ai été très satisfaite de ce côté. Ne vous faites pas prendre au piège de vouloir trop commander et laisser des restes car c'est 1$ du mcx gaspillé!
Bonne ambiance, le boeuf était d'une tendreté rarement mangé, sushis super bon. Pétoncles frits, dumpling, patate douce frite, délicieux!!!
J'y retourne bientôt c'est certain!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start! This is definitely a restaurant I have been to several times over the course of 2-3 years. And I can tell you that not once have I walked away from this restaurant feeling down or unsatisfied. 

The customer service is simple. Because it's the customers who are cooking the food (besides sushi and anything fried), it's not a surprise that the customer service isn't as individualized. The staff is expected to just bring the ingredients, fill your water glasses, and take away the empty plates. And what's great is that if you order too many plates, they will warn you of the consequences and see to it that you take only a third or half of those plates. Besides, it's not over if you finish everything and still want more. You're always welcome to send in a new order slip to them. Just leave it on the table and they'll come pick it up. If the metal grill, on which you cook the meat, seafood, and veggies, gets soiled, a waiter will come around to change it. And you don't even have to ask them to sometimes. Same with the refilling of water. I am aware that some reviewers have had problems with reservations, but when it comes to the actual service of food, there are few to no complaints. 

Now onto the exciting part: the meat. For carnivores like me, this is perhaps a restaurant that will have your heart's desires in mind. They serve very juicy and tender meat, that is, if you cook it well enough. They serve a large variety of meat, and you may be able to try all that they offer if you go at dinner time. My favourites are the spare ribs and ox tongue. The chewiness of the latter appeals to me. And spare ribs are very commonly used in Korean BBQ. The only meat I would refrain from is the chicken. It tends to come out very dry and nearly flavourless. Shame, for chicken is one type of food I crave most days. 

All the vegetables come out fresh and can be eaten uncooked, but I would highly recommend cooking the mushrooms at least. In fact, I love the mushrooms so much I order at least 3 plates of them. Anyway, at any restaurant offering Korean BBQ, mushrooms are a popular accompaniment. And of course, if you're not too keen on the veggies, there are soups and salads along with non-BBQ dishes, like dumplings and sushi, to choose from. Heck, they even have french fries and popcorn chicken. Yes, you heard me right. French fries. 

After all's been said and eaten, you can never go wrong with unlimited ice cream. As I always tell my friends when I go to an all-you-can-eat place, I have a second stomach for ice cream. In my most recent visit, I had 4 bowls of ice cream. Each bowl equals one scoop by the way, so I fortunately did not get brain freeze. 

Just be careful of what time you go at and how much they charge you. If you come near the end of the lunch period, you will have to pay the dinner fee, which is higher of course. But at least you'll be offered a larger variety of food. 
And sometimes if you come in large groups, your receipt may indicate a slightly different total price from the other receipts, even in the case when everyone has ordered the same things and nothing requiring extra charges."}
{"text":"The price is not bad, but I would have expected better for it. The meat was bland, with only the short ribs and pork being decent. The side dishes didn't make sense, they were very \"Americanized\", and I don't understand why you have to pay extra money for lettuce. The price isn't that much extra, but it's the concept. Isn't meat more expensive than lettuce? Why is that unlimited..."}
{"text":"They pick up your food and not far from where is my table, just next to the entrance, there's a bin where the empty dishes go. The waiter throw the dishes instead of putting the dishes in the bin and that is so noisy for the ears. The noise seemed to be forever. The design of the table were nice and our waiter also."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving Seoul Chako 3 stars is because their late-night AYCE deal gets you a lot of food for what you pay. The quality of the meat (especially the chicken) is subpar, but it will definitely leave you full if you come on an empty stomach. There is also quite a variety of fried small plates (we got the fried scallops, potstickers, potato croquettes, and spring rolls), which is really odd for a KBBQ place, but you can't really expect much from restaurant that doesn't have Korean ownership (hint, it's Chinese-owned). Normally, I wouldn't go here or even eat Korean barbecue in Montréal since it's pretty abysmal, but it's good if you're in a group, have the late-night munchies, and want unlimited ice cream to go along with it, I guess."}
{"text":"I decided to come by here at random, the restaurant is eye catching so I walked in. I did have quite the appetite and it was filling as it is all you can eat. 

However, the service is very slow, be prepared to wave your hand to catch the waiters attention. The food was average, the meats were barely marinated, sushi was decent. The fried tempuras were good, can't really mess that up. The service is what is hurting the restaurant. If you're reading this, please step it up to increase and keep your business.

This place is quantity over quality, which I do prefer at times but this place isn't worth trying."}
{"text":"Shit restaurant. Disgusting food. Bad waiters. 
This restaurant for pig not for human
I never had eat like bad food in Montreal. 
And also Very expensive (25 dollars for this...) 

If you want to have the worst moment in Montreal, go here !

From a French chef."}
{"text":"The food was mostly good, portions are good most of the time but since is a buffet doesn't really matter for the most part. That being I don't think that it's worth it for the price, it's not the only Korean BBQ in town and the quality could be better. The service was not good. The waiter didn't come every time we ask something, and he seem like he didn't understand when we spoke. I think is important for waiters for speak French as well since I had to translate for my friends."}
{"text":"It was recommended by friend, I tried it last night. Their oil pan disgusting and greezy, I asked the manager or the part-timer to change the pan, he insisted that this pan is completely washed by machine and second washed by oil(?!?!). AND he gave me this 'what do u know about it! Shut up and eat' face. Umm I do know because I've been to many 'real' korean bbq places where they wash their pan with sponges and scrub every greese out until it is clean and shiny. I really dont want this restaurants to be named \"Korean Chaco\". This is not a korean style, everything is fusion , Japanese and the manager is Chinese. This is a shame restaurant to be called a Korean restaurant. Most disgusting place I ever been. Dont try to guard yourself when somebody asks you to change. Totally not worth my money. I would rather go to Pizza Pizza"}
{"text":"This is a great Korean BBQ place, provided you are willing to put through bad service, long waiting time and crowded space. 
I went here with family and we had to wait for about an hour, the lady at the restaurant was oblivious to the empty tables or the long queue extending outside in the cold. People in the queue were getting quite restless looking at the empty tables from outside. 
The food was like any Korean BBQ, nothing special. The pork and beef options were good, chicken not so much. 
They had a nice selection of desserts, however the staff was least interested in replenishing the ones that were over. 

I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend this to others."}
{"text":"average quality and taste, not wow but one of thoses places we kept going
back when we were shorts of idea where to eat and feel like having buffet style."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm!

Service has noticeably improved on busy nights.

Lettuce vanished from the menu... Sad day for ssambap.

Ordering is now efficiently done thru a paper form system so no more plates left behind (or language barrier with some of the staff)

Thanks for dropping by my previous reviews."}
{"text":"Went for one of those after midnight special with a few friends and we had terrible service. Waiters were rude and obviously didn't care about customer service. Would never come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was pretty shocked to learn that Mtl now had a legit Korean BBQ place, so naturally my expectations were raised. In comparison to Korean you can get in Toronto, this place is generic.

The marinades on the meats leave much to be desired. While the freshness is evident, the \"Korean\" flavor is diluted."}
{"text":"It's a cool concept. I do have to admit that I love coming here, I just wish the food quality was just a lil bit higher."}
{"text":"All you can eat? Korean BBQ? I'm sold.

This place is almost too good to be true. The wait staff was amazingly friendly and quick. 
We had several orders of the beef and beef ribs. Both were absolutely delicious...and we loved cooking it ourselves. We prefer the beef ribs slightly charred like my boyfriends mom makes at home. 
We also had the pickled veggies and dumpling. I absolutely loved the pickled daikon, cucumbers and carrots. The dumplings were deep fried, and while they were quite good, I think I prefer pan fried dumplings (potstickers or gyoza). 
Also, the lychee martini was amazing, and if it hadn't been so hot out, I'd probably have had a few more. They were some of the cheapest cocktails around. (I think 5.75 cad or something).
The only hiccup was the internet was down so they couldn't take cards or print a bill, but they did have an ATM so we were able to grab cash out right on the spot.

This place made our trip from BTV to Montreal worth it. I would drive back just to have dinner here."}
{"text":"I went back yesterday to eat again with a big group and the food is still great but the service was incredibly bad.. After we wrote the order the waiter came and sarcastically said do not worry we are open until 10 pm, meaning we order too much. Then again while a small kid was eating her fries he took her plate away and she cried because still was fries in here palate. That was very impolite and out right rude, the irony was that we mandatory had to pay the tips I do not think that was faire."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated group room but the service was mediocre and when I paid my tab I kinda felt ripped off.

{"text":"The food was great and the environment was nice and spacious. They were quick when you place your order. The food came out in minutes for us to cook. Great spot for lunch or dinner!"}

{"text":"J'ai dû dire que il n'est pas bon comme avant. Je suis y allée pour bcp de fois, mais cette fois, je me sens pas bon...."}
{"text":"YOu need a reservation or else you'll be waiting a long time outside. The decor is a bit tacky and it's dirty. The tables, chairs and menus were dirty and sticky. I did like the concept of this restaurant.
So much things to choose from and it doesn't come in big quantity so you can taste a lot of things without being to full.

Personally I didn't like the food, everything tastes the same, some kind of spice or something. Not a great choice of alcohol, shots were super expensive. The wine was good :)

If you wanna try something new, this is a place for you!"}
{"text":"Although I love the concept, I was not thrilled with the food here. The best thing I would say is the chicken. It has a nice flavour to it. Other than that, I feel the food is quite bland. With no sauce or spice on the other meat, seafood and veggies, grilling just doesn't do enough. The pieces of salmon seemed fresh but when cooked just felt boring due to the fact they they were just simple raw pieces of salmon with no taste. I feel this place should offer sides of spices and special sauces to help compliment their meat. For me anyways, this would give a huge boost."}
{"text":"Service is a hit or miss at Seoul Chako. They close their restaurant one hour before the closing time. One of the times that I've been there at 10:30 pm and they told me it was closed when clearly there was still people eating inside and the sign says it closes at 11:30 pm. Sometimes their sushi has too much rice. I also think it is a little over priced.

By the way on the weekend they charge you automatic 15% \"gratuity\" without telling you even if your only a table of two!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and like the atmosphere.
It has a nice decor and creative concept.
All-You-Can-Eat Buffet, Reasonably priced.
Great if you have a big appetite
They also have a late night buffet that starts at 11pm (15$) but keep in mind, there are less choices on the menu. Definitely try the mango ice cream ! Good choice for a first date. Social environment, perfect for get togethers with friends & families as well as groups."}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE Korean BBQ place at a decent price. Also have japanese sushi rolls. Long lines though so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"It's always a busy place so don't expect a nice service. 
But the food is delicous and worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing experience! Definitely worth a try and worth the money. I especially felt I needed to write this because other reviewers are complaining that they had to 'cook your own food'.. that's like going to play golf and complaining about having to swing your own club.."}
{"text":"I've been going there for such a looong time now so when they first started, they were the first one to really make korean BBQ famous here in montreal. It's always a nice place to go with a huge group and to just introduce korean BBQ to newbies. When you become more familiar with the place, you become less amazed and start to pick up on the bad aspect of the resto. The customer service is reallyyy poor: waiters ignoring you or your order, they are even rude at times, the long wait time for your order, even worse, sometimes they forget some of the dishes you ordered and its only after you've eaten everything else that you realise that they forgot 2-3 plates. Once, my group of friends and I felt discriminated (we were a group of black people) because all of a sudden when we asked for the bill, instead of our waiter it was the manager who came himself, took a good look at each of us, then gave us our bill. We felt that the service was sooo bad that we decided to not give much tip, but then the manager argued that for a big group like us we should give more tip... We were FLA-BBER--GAST! It was the last time I went there.."}
{"text":"J'adore les BBQ coréens et depuis quelques temps, j'aperçois pleins de petits bouis-bouis qui fleurissent au centre-ville. Tant mieux, voilà une belle addition culinaire dans le circuit gourmand montréalais.

J'ai essayé ce buffet un mercredi midi, avec des amis. Le resto est assez récent. L'ambiance était calme, peu de clients (il faut dire qu'il a fait 26 degrés à l'extérieur...), donc on pouvait bavarder en paix. La décoration est sobre. 

Le buffet est un prix fixe (la semaine le midi, c'était 13,99 $ moins 10% de rabais du lundi au jeudi). Il y a un menu et on commande ce que l'on veut manger à la serveuse. 

Le service était un peu mal organisé au début, ce n'était pas clair à qui il fallait commander, car plusieurs employés arrivaient avec les différents plats. Bon, pour nous, ce n'était pas très grave, car on avait le temps. Mais je conseille de vous armer d'un peu de patience et de temps disponible si vous mangez là!


Petit bémol: primo, la laitue iceberg est 1,50$ en extra (pourquoi???) et les boissons (y compris le thé vert) ne sont pas incluses dans le prix du buffet. Secondo, il n'y a pas de shoju, un alcool pourtant typiquement coréen (????)

Petit plus: le prix qui est doux pour le porte-feuille et le fait que c'est un buffet à volonté. Parfait pour vos carnivores affamés préférés!

Est-ce que j'y retournerai? Probablement pas, car il y a tellement de restos dans ce coin-là et que j'aimerais essayer. J'ai mangé dans de meilleurs restos coréens ailleurs."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, but I suggest not to get the calamari, it tasted none just hard. Don't forget to get the ice cream!!!! I recommend"}
{"text":"Can I get service?!? No really, I don't know what the hell happened but I was curious to try it out for lunch so I lined up 10 minutes prior to opening.  Finally getting seated, I immediately wrote down what I wanted...and waited...and waited...everyone else was getting served. I didn't even receive my water while the table next by was already grilling their stuff. What terrible service!  I left after waiting a solid 15 minutes.  Went else where. Awful service. They didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"I thought I'd feel really cheated in grilling my own meat, I was wrong it's super fun! The only previous Korean BBQ experience I've had, the waiter grilled everything in front of us, it was delicious..and awkward.
Turns out Seoul Chako has grills embedded in tables so you are the grill master! 

Sadly that was where the fun ended for us. The vibe is odd: they obviously want to be this cool lounge, but it's essentially a buffet, so expect a loud, continuous flow of employees bussing dirty plates everywhere. The selection is good, but you'll be lucky if you end up with what you ordered! Our pork became pork belly, we got less veggies than advertised on the menu, if we got them at all, and the pineapple order will get you one (1) slice. That's it! Our waitress was super efficient otherwise, so efficient that around 10:00pm she ducked down below our table to turn off our grill.. 15 minutes later she explained the kitchen would be closing. The food is good, but the portions are somewhat small, which is to be expected, so get the most of your $27!"}
{"text":"If you shove a bunch of starved people in a restaurant in the apocalyptic world, it would look like this place. 

Don't come here for the quality of food. Come here if you are close to dying of hunger and want to stuff your mouth with somewhat digestible food. 

Our orders were lost and we didn't get some of what we ordered. People who arrived after me got their orders first. The food items that we ordered the first around came an hour later. We didn't have meat until 30 minutes of waiting. This place is just chaos."}
{"text":"Love this place. For $14.99, all you can eat Korean BbQ is a huge deal. I love the short ribs the most, so tender and tasty. I don't know if it's true but on the menu it stated that you would be charged $1 for each piece left-over. The all you can eat menu includes sushi and ice cream as well. Definitely will come back when i visit Montreal again"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Korean barbecue, and I must say that I had a good experience.  I was expecting service to be mediocre and the place to smell of barbecue, but it wasn't.  It was surprisingly better than I had anticipated.  

The way it works is that you just look at the menu, choose what you wanted, and check it off on a list.  You then give your list to your server and s/he will bring you the raw ingredients.  You have to cook it yourself, but that's part of what makes the experience interesting. 

My favorites were the sliced ribs and the calamari.  The calamari was surprisingly very tender, and the beef was well marinated.  Definitely a must try! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Si j'avais à résumer le Seoul Chako en un seul mot, je choisirais celui-là : Gargantuesque. 
 
L'endroit est un BBQ coréen avec service à volonté. Ce qui veut dire qu'on fait cuire les aliments soi-même sur un gril installé au centre de la table. Le tout est alimenté par un flot pratiquement ininterrompu de buf, de saumon, de calmar, de porc mariné et/ou de crevette servis (déversé?) à votre table selon la quantité demandée. Voici donc l'endroit de prédilection dans le centre-ville pour les gros appétits.

Dans l'ensemble, les aliments sont offerts dans une assez grande diversité et dans une fraicheur très correcte. Certaines aliments sont marinées, d'autres, tel que le saumon ou le calmar, sont servis tel quel. Pour ma part, j'aimerais voir au menu beaucoup plus de type de marinade. Après tout, il s'agit de l'une des forces de la cuisine Coréenne, non ? 

Points forts : La quantité, la quantité, la quantité. La côte de buf marinée est excellente. Le concept est relativement unique que l'on ne voit jamais ailleurs dans les restos canadiens. 

Les points négatifs : Le service est parfois désorganisé. Les soirs de fin de semaine, attendez à faire la file. La prise de réservation semble relativement chaotique car j'ai souvent vu des clients argumenté avec le placier les soirs de grande affluence. Le choix de viande marinée est assez limité. Pas de Soju disponible (c'est un resto Coréen, non???). L'ambiance rappel un peu les restos fast-food. Surtout, on évite la pour un rendez-vous romantique. 

Somme-toute, c'est une assez bonne expérience culinaire axé sur la quantité, voir sur les excès de table. On vient surtout ici avec son groupe d'ami affamé par une froide soirée d'hiver pour se goinfrer, s'empiffrer et prendre quelques livres."}
{"text":"TL:DR - Basically 30 bucks for good Korean BBQ and Sushi Buffet

I've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ place.  I've been to an AYCE sushi place.  But I've never been to an AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi place.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't prepared to come otherwise I would've worn some looser fitting clothes.   We wanted to go to a place down the street but our group was too big for them to accommodate.  So we naturally followed the crowd and saw the line at Seoul Chako and decided to eat here instead.  Luckily for us, the place is big and was able to take our group after a short wait.

This place is perfect for a bunch of meat hungry guys.  Hmm, that did't sound right.  Nevertheless, you pick from menu with well over a dozen different kinds of meat and seafood.
Each order comes in a small bowl with a small portion for you to cook yourself on a grill that's built into your table.  There's no limit on the amount that you can order so as long you eat it all other wise you'll be charged extra.  All the meats I tried were good, tender, and well marinated.  Everything on the sushi menu, although limited, was good and above average for a buffet.  

My only gripe was our server.  He was slow with our drinks and food and some of requests were met with a eye roll.  Not sure if he hates his job or was just repulsed by the amount of food that us Americans were throwing down but he did not look like he wanted to be there.  

Regardless, this is one of MANY restaurants along St. Catherine but should be up among the places you should try especially if you're trying to accommodate a big group."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat with a group of friends if you're hungry! All you can eat Korean BBQ and sushi! The meats are very delicious and juicy, and the sushi is average, but all you can eat? Who's to complain. I would not recommend if you're craving good sushi. Lastly, the mango and strawberry ice are the BOMB. For the price of about 26$ it's a very fair deal.

One thing that threw me off is the service and cleanliness. Firstly, they are very slow at bringing things like extra mayonnaise, or refills on water. Secondly, the waiter straight up told that he had a very high fever for the past few days, after he was handling all the food and drinks that we ate (luckily we didn't get sick..). Lastly, the counters and grills were all dirty..

Overall, the idea and restaurant itself is amazing. However management needs to clean up and get their S*** together."}
{"text":"I heard the hype about these Korean BBQ joints, so o checked one out tonight, and I wasn't impressed at all. All of there meats were barely seasoned, there vegetables have nothing on them at all, no salt or pepper. The chicken and salmon kept getting stuck to the grill, like wouldn't u think it would be a non stick grill, that fire is way to hot...and the service, wow.. Yeah they were fast but they kept forgetting things. 

I enjoyed there short ribs cause they seem to be the only thing that were seasoned. I can't get over the veggies, no seasoning or anything. I asked for a dipping sauce for the chicken and the waiter came with salt.  I guess there was a lack of communication on my part... Right.

The only thing really good about this spot is its open really late on Friday and Saturdays. I really wanted to enjoy my first Korean BBQ experience but left there wondering why we paid over 30$ for tasteless food."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  We went in for the Korean BBQ, and were very impressed by the size of the plates that were offered. Two big hungry guys were stuffed after two rounds and barely had room for dessert. I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I only liked 2 things from the menu ALOT when I first came, which was the rib steaks and chicke filet. They were incredibly flavorful and fully loaded with an awesome and tasty marination and sooo juicy  . Everything else was very bland. I didn't like any of the sushi specialties,  just the regular cucumber and avocado makis which were nice and refreshing. 

The second time i went, we felt everything was tasteless, and the avocado was a bit browned :(
My friend didn't like the saki, it was very vinagery. I haven't tried a saki I liked yet, so I wouldn't know.  And the side order of spicy mayo wasn't spicy at all, tasted like mayo with food coloring    :(

And the service was very poor in the begining at our 2nd time. I wasn't too happy about just arriving like 20 min before the lunch time they stated, and yet still get charged for dinner, which is the same thing but for 2x$. They should have written it at the right time. Also a waiter told us to pay right after we ordered our first round because he was ending his shift, so we had to split his tip with the next waiter, instead of paying a full tip each, which would have been double for us, my friend was upset about that. Near the end a really good worker began his shift, and he was taking our plates very fast, so my friend decided to give the tip to him.

She doesn't want to go back there. I was disapointed at what was awesome last time, tasted completely different this time."}
{"text":"J'y suis allez pour ma fête l'an passer et pour celle de ma soeur cette année et c'etait vraiment nice quoi qu l'attente est très longue!! Les viandes gouttent toutes la même chose, ils devraient diversifier les marinades! Mais sinon cest delicieux!"}
{"text":"There are some great things about this place, and some terrible things.

GOOD:
the menu selection is so big!
I love the cook-your-own-meat. 
the sushi isn't bad for an all-you-can-eat
the sushi pizza is goooooooood

BAD:
the service - they sometimes forget things you ordered, and sometimes ignore your table
the price - $25 AND a charge if you don't finish things 
the portions are pretty small, but I guess you can order more
there's no special treatment, the service will put down your dishes anywhere on the table (so you have to put them in front of whoever ordered them) and walk away immediately

Overall, it's a fine experience if you are willing to pay a fair bit to eat for a while, or if you eat a lot."}
{"text":"Exellent service avec Ong. Le steak selection est un must. Suberbe ambiance et service ultra rapide!"}
{"text":"Un peu avant Noel, mon ami et moi avons un souper longuement et de multiples fois reporté: du BBQ Coréen. Maintenant, je commence en disant que ce n'est pas du BBQ Coréen authentique selon les fanatiques exagérés mais on s'en fou.... non non, vraiment on s'en fou! C'est bon? Oui, C'est cher? Non, C'est frais? Oui. Belle carte pas complique, 20-30 choix d'accompagnement pour l'aspect BBQ, des sushis (Je n'en ait pas manger, mais ils ont l'air ok, rien de wow, mais très honête.) Du Poulet Pop Corn, et quelques autres trucs. Je parle du poulet pop corn parce que c'était délicieux. Le prix ? 21.99$ pour un repas a volonté et 14.99$ a volonté le vendredi soir. VEN-DRE-DI! hey c'est pas l'arnaque du moins cher le mercredi entre 15h et 18h ou une merde du genre. Nah nah nah, toute la soirée. Je vais y retourné c'est 100% certain. 

Ah mais comment ça marche? Tu prends ta carte, tu mets des numéros et une quantité dessus, le/la serveur/se l'amène en moins de 5 minutes, t'as une plaque bbq au centre de la table et tu fais cuir ton lunch.  Très bon service, rapide et courtois, je le recommande."}
{"text":"Very good! A lot of choice ! Worth if you eat a lot! Do not go if you are vegetarian though!!!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you go to with people who you're comfortable enough to stuff your face with. Because I don't care how much willpower you think you have, once that menu is set on the table, Pandora's box is opening, and it's full of Korean BBQ. 

Now it's not the best Korean BBQ spot ever, but it's certainly not the worst. You get what you pay for, and you'll leave satisfied. That's really all there is to it. That said, I could eat their deep fried scallops by the cupful (not recommended)."}
{"text":"As my first time trying Korean BBQ, I wasn't sure what to expect and I have nothing else to compare it to. I'm generally not too adventurous when it comes to trying Asian or exotic cuisine but I greatly enjoyed Seoul Chako.

First off, it's a beautiful place. I eat with the eyes and my mouth and it's always nice being surrounded by good company and a nice environment. Their decor is really modern, it has that \"loungy\" look with the changing ambiance lights from their entrance, to the bar and booths. Even their bathroom, especially the sink,  is gorgeous!

I went on a Friday, around 6 pm. It was just the perfect time to go as it wasn't crowded and we obtained really fast service. As the evening goes on, it does tend to fill up quick. We got everything we wanted, whenever we wanted.
It helps if you are sitting somewhere near the bar, where everyone is working, or if you make eye contact occasionally with the server, otherwise they might not check up on you as often.
The food isn't complicated,  I didn't get a chance to sample much but it was tasty.
I got the beef slices, spare ribs and chicken. Slight inconvenience with the chicken is that it's cut thicker than the other meats and takes a little bit more time to cook.
There's a few selection of side dishes like appetizers and meats to choose from.
I found the vegetables a little odd, as the onions, green peppers, or sweet potato for example are raw and flavorless. Putting them on the grill dried them out and I wish I knew what kind of sauces or marinades would help.

An important thing worth mentioning, is that in order to discourage waste, they charge 1$ for every piece of leftover meat. I suggest ordering things you know you will like first. Ask your waiter if you aren't sure of something or look at the tables around you.
Every order of meat comes in a portion of about 4 pieces.

There is also a few dessert choices included in the meal, the mango ice cream and pudding are delicious. I had quite a few order of those and couldn't get over the freshness and taste. The actual chunks of mango in the pudding give it a great texture.

The only drawbacks were price. I found 23$ a person on weekends a little bit much. It's a couple dollars cheaper during the week or for lunch and the menu barely varies. I also wish there was a drink included in the meal, a simple soda or tea would do.

Overall, the food is good, perhaps not mind blowing as you're cooking it yourself...but it's a great experience, definitely fun and engaging. The grill is well designed, self ventilated and clean for each customer.
I recommend this place for a date, when you aren't rushed to eat and enjoy talking or as a group outing."}
{"text":"The worst Korean cuisine I've ever had. The waitress is not willing to change the baking tray even it's get severely charred."}
{"text":"Good KBBQ for groups.

Good environment 

Lot of choice 

Various price with different time 

Close late night for night out"}
{"text":"We just went there on a Saturday afternoon without any expectations but just to try something new. We were not disappointed actually. We enjoyed the experience more than the food. Each table is equipped with a BBQ grill where you grill your food yourself. The service is pretty slow hence you it's better to order in advance. Out of all chicken theriyala was my favorite."}
{"text":"I think that for what we pay, Seoul Chako is quite good. The meats are well marinated and seasoned, and there is a good selection. The reason why I only give 3 stars is for 2 main reasons, the first being the service. Last time, we had to ask 4 times for our gril to be changed before it was changed (we waited more than 20 minutes). The restaurants wasn't event that busy when it happened. Also, it happened quite a few times that not all the items we ordered came out. The second reason is the most important I believe. Me and my friends asked for chocolate ice cream. When it came out, I took a spoonfull, and spit it right away; the ice cream tasted like shit. I belive it was expired. 
Would coma again, but will never order chocolate ice cream ever again."}
{"text":"MAKE SURE U CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE U PAY. The only reason I left this review is because it cheated us. Last nite 12 of us went there for dinner, service was ok, but at the end they over charged us for holiday price. After I went back to hotel and checked online, n asked my friends in Canada, there's no such holiday in Canada. We will never come here again."}
{"text":"My first Korean bbq restaurant I've ever been to! They had something for each of my picky friends - which is always a bonus! The menu is huge and has many great options to choose from. Everything we ordered tasted delicious. However the service was awful. We had to flag down our waiter each time we wanted to place a new ticket, and even had to remind her for a water refill. The food came out all in various waves. Sometimes items we ordered would never reach our table and items we definitely didn't order would come out. This place deserves 5/5 stars, but I sadly, can't give it close because of the service. Still a definite must try while in Montreal! $27 dollars for all you can eat ...so go hungry!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go on a friday or saturday after a few (many) drinks. Who can say no to 14.99$ all you can eat korean bbq. At this time choices are limited, but the beef is delicious and so are the fries. What more can I ask for!?

I have been there for a regular lunch hour. The advantage of that is that on top of the delicious meet selection I can also get some sushi. The service is fast and they are really friendly. Only thing is... sometimes the grill doesnt get hot enough and you cant cook quite as fast as youd like. 

I will keep comming here when I get that late night craving... better than poutine hands down"}
{"text":"Première expérience de nourriture coréenne réussie! Ça n'a pas pris 5 minutes après avoir été assise pour qu'un Yelpeur m'envoie un commentaire de check-in qui disait \"Le meilleur est à NDG mais tu as bien choisi.\" Le concept ici est bien simple. C'est un menu à volonté donc on vous recommande d'y aller avec moins et de commander plusieurs fois pour ne pas rien gaspiller. Les viandes, fruits de mer et légumes sont cuit sur la plaque chauffante du milieu de votre table. Mes coups de coeur: le boeuf, le poulet et les pétoncles frites. À ne pas prendre la prochaine fois: les sushis. Le service est excellent et vous n'aurez presque pas besoin d'attendre donc si vous voulez une pose entre deux commandes, vous êtes presque mieux de simplement attendre avant de passer votre deuxième. Aussi, ils ont plusieurs spéciaux sur les boissons comme les Bleues à 2 pour 4.75$"}
{"text":"They just opened a new location on St Catherine across Odaki. I recommend not getting shrimp or chicken wings as the shrimp was very messy to grill then peel off the skin. The chicken had no seasoning so it was dry. The beef ribs and the beef flank were very tasty. The beef brochettes are also a good choice. The calamari is hard to cook because you may overcook it. The price and the amounted food you could order was worth it. I would come again"}
{"text":"i must say, the price is high. but worth it if you're starving! service is sometimes slow, and orders are sometimes ignored without any notice. you know what?!?! just don't eat all day, come here at night, order everything, eat everything (but don't waste, do not waste, they'll charge you on that). do like my girlfriend did, order every type of ice cream and enjoy while you're about to explode!!! that is how you have to eat here!!! i hope you'll enjoy, spend your money wisely people!"}
{"text":"I was actually expecting the worst from my first impressions but by the end it wasn't that bad. I would have given it a 3.5 star. Girl at the front needs to learn how to smile. Zero character!!! Tables were dirty and had to ask them to clean it. But the food was half decent. Nothing to what I am used to when I am in Hong Kong where I normally have my Korean BBQ fix. Would I go back?? Maybe but I always do in HK!!"}
{"text":"Un excellent barbecue Coréen all you can eat. La carte propose un bon nombre d'ingrédients à faire griller sur le barbecue au milieu de la table. Les sushis sont très bons sans être le principale atout de l'établissement. Le service est irréprochable et très rapide. Le prix n'excède pas les 35$ par personne et les vaut largement."}
{"text":"Okay food. The selected meats are the best. Every time I come here I order one plate of fish and end up throwing it away with fear of getting food poisoning. The service is a hit or miss. I've come here several times and the staff is either very friendly or couldn't care less about you. Try the strawberry yoghurt ice cream and mango pudding as dessert!"}
{"text":"Here is the story: my girlfriend is a sushi lover and I don't even like seafood. And this caused an unhealed wound in our relationship till she introduced me to Seoul Chako. She is enjoying their, supposedly, delicious sushi \"stuff\" while I am loving the whole grilling experience and eating lamb slices, steak, beef, and chicken. Finally, problem solved."}
{"text":"Great place in a neighborhood full of good ethnic food.  I got a table right next to St. Catherine so I could watch the parade of oddballs ambling about, and got the BBQ setup on my table.  Took a while to figure out how to avoid cooking too fast or slow, but eventually I became a BBQ master - the key is to keep the flame just going so you can cook at the same pace you eat.  Awesome.  Service was quick as well."}
