{"text":"The presentation of this place is very nice.  I was instantly drawn to it as I walked by.  Inside it's more like seat yourself, which is fine.  High tables, lot of people don't like that but I was fine with it.  Decor and ambiance is fitting to the theme of the place.  Drink menu was very extensive, I'm a scotch guy, mixed drinks are not really my thing but when in Rome, why not.  I had the flaming Manhattan immediately and the presentation was just right, because I like smokey scotch I figured I would like a smokey bourbon - was a treat to watch the prep.  After a while I was notified by my server, who was always available, that my food would be a bit late.  Without drawing this review out, I just want to say, it was no one's fault specifically to the delay and I didn't take any offence.  The manager came and apologized, I said it was ok.  Not only did the food come out shortly after and it was delicious, the staff there felt very bad about the delay and they made sure I left happy by taking care of me however they could.  Truth be told even if the food was terrible, I'd still give this place a 5 just because of how they treated me.  I appreciated it greatly. Thank you Thiago, you are an utmost professional and you will go a long way with you're demeanor.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I loved their food and drinks.  We ordered some pork ribs and beef brisket and they were smoky delicious. I also ordered a Ceasar and  it even came with a sausage on top! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Door Fifty Five.  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the chicken was delicious.  The only issue was that there was too much batter and not enough of the chicken.  Their house hot sauce was amazing.   The waiter will come around and ask you if you want to try it which I would highly recommend.  The hot sauce with the chicken was delicious.  They provided great service and I would definitely go back to try out more items on their menu."}
{"text":"We found this new place recently and absolutely love it! The waitress was awesome and very helpful, the rest of the personnel and the drinks were original named and excellent. We had the Moscow Mule, Ahumado, Sazerac and the Nero Margaritas, last one I highly recommend to try! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and no more is because of the prices, all drinks are expensive. Beers prices are ok."}
{"text":"Cant really say anything bad about this place besides you get some drunk fools at times latenight... But other than that the drink menu is impressive, Moscow mules are delicious and all the food ive had is good+"}
{"text":"Drinks were great - had multiple draft beers and a cocktail (French 75 - gin and lemon). Server was super helpful in both drink and food choices. Food was amazing. We had the Boss platter (multiple meats, fries, chili, several sauces including awesome peppercorn chicken gravy), turkey salad, mac and cheese, cornbread muffins, chicken and waffle. All the food had a bit of a spicy kick to it (in a good way) and was really good with descent portion sizes. We live in Toronto but will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Called for reservations, was told just to come in,  had a big party,  when we got there saw reserved signs on all tables.  Was told they took no reservations and manager was unhelpful and unwilling to accommodate our party."}
{"text":"Honestly from all the good reviews I thought it would be better. Their drinks are what they are known for I went with a big group so I got to taste a lot of them the pink panther is probably the best one it has a grapefruit base and it was half decent. a lot of their other drinks we disgusting specifically the floral one which tasted like perfume. lastly I ordered mac and cheese omg worst mac and cheese of my life...dry, not cheesy, and extremely small portion. this place is over priced and the food is not up to par with their prices. people go for the patio and location as it kinda turns into a club later in the evening."}
{"text":"I was here with my fiance last night and had an amazing time here. My fiance is a wiskey drinker and they had a wide variety of selection to choose from. I had to cocktails clover and the pink panther which i really enjoyed. The food a small selection but definitely a must with the brisket and chicken and waffle. It was soo good. Lastly best service ever. My server was so friendly and put a smile on my face as if we were friends.  I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Top Spot in 'Sauga......Wilcox is number 2!  Fried chicken on waffles was amazing!  High quality chicken, did not cut corners.   A bit pricey but they back it up with quality, taste, and portion size #worth it!!  The Shrimp and grits also outstanding!   Best blackened shrimp I have ever had - smoky and amazing.  The cocktail also delivered, but not as much bang for your buck as the food.  A really awesome place and we need more like it around here!"}
{"text":"That one time you forget to tip, they will threaten you, publicly shame you, and then proceed to ban you."}
{"text":"We took my father to Door FiftyFive last night and it was excellent. There was 8 of us and every one had a great time. The food and drinks where really good and the atmosphere was perfect. The service was to shelf. Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"Who dropped the hipster bar in Port Credit? Drinks were amazing but expensive.  Disappointed with the tiny portions of food.  I had to get a slice of pizza after.  I see from other review that the portion sizes were decent so many I just got unlucky as I think I was there on opening night."}
{"text":"cool barrel, rustic wood decor...server was so knowledgeable of food and drink....had a great time and sat at the best seat in the house (booth at front)  not so much in winter when door opens....i was pleasantly surprised to hear the music get louder, and crowds coming in for a cool bar atmosphere a night....thought it was a restaurant...but really a bar with great southern food , drinks and great times."}
{"text":"Great southern BBQ comfort food. Service was attentive and fast. Overall good experience!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday at around 9pm. We were seated fairly quickly and we were served fast aswell. If you are hungry i recommend the FarmZilla. Awesome resturant, with a love band. i would definitly come back."}
{"text":"Mac & cheese was a bit under seasoned and the boar? Kind of just cubes of chewy dryness.  The bf had the chicken and waffles....first time, hard to find in Mississauga. He wolfed it down. The cornbread muffins with the honey butter were delicious but would've been spectacular if still hot."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Had chicken & waffle, wings & big burger. Every dish exceeds my expectation."}
{"text":"Ok! A review! Finally!  Since Kris U and I decided to grab an old fashioned here in August, not long after Door55 opened, I have been back a number of times, bringing different friends each time and even hitting up a yelp event!  As you might be able to tell by my photo gallery and by my rating here, I think that this is exactly the kind of place I have been waiting for in Port Credit, a proper craft cocktail bar with a concise and very cool menu. Any place that throws \"the Wu\" W onto the menu for chicken and waffles is already going to get some points from me.  In this review I will cover cocktails:  1 - the old fashioned - perfect balance, and a nice collection of bourbons to customize should you desire. ( check out the whiskey tunnel at the back).  2 - the negroni - second only to Audrey at the Chase.  3 - the smoked Manhattan - at 25 bucks a pop I splurged with friends for the show. The Manhattan is mixed and put into a glass.  The glass then sits on top of a bed of freshly lit wood and is covered with a glass dome for smoke infusion.  Very smoky and great if you are into that which I am. Make sure the bartender wipes the glass before you drink from it coming out of the smoke.....otherwise you get smoke stained hands!  4 - the garden of Eden....yes....it is floral, and yes, it is very good!   Next review....the food!"}
{"text":"Oh my god... SO GOOD! We had the chicken and waffles, the wild boar mac n' cheese, the ribs, a pitcher of Amsterdam 416, and a Sazerac. Everything was AMAZING! So delicious, so tasty, so satisfying. On top of great food and drinks, this place has great atmosphere and super wonderful staff and owners! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I lived in Missisauga for almost 10 years and we never had cool cocktail bars like this until I moved away. Still, I go back to visit friends and family from time to time and will try to sneak a pit stop at this hip whiskey bar whenever I can. The cocktails are great and the whiskey list is extensive. I've never eaten here personally but have heard good reviews from friends. Definitely a gem in Port Credit."}
{"text":"Saw the bouncers (or owners)  nearly beat up a poor homeless guy looking for a handout when I was walking past there looks like a place for rich assholes"}
{"text":"Got lucky and found this gem! I travel a lot and am a self proclaimed foodie and frequent yelper (because I realize how important reviews are for restaurants). Ordered the corn muffins with honey butter crack to start, best corn muffins ever! Then the smoked brisket sandwich, that was equally amazing! The owner actually brought out the sandwich and described the ingredients and sourcing. The bar is solid too, a good beer and alcohol selection. This guy is passionate about his food! Warning: If you're looking for a vegan dish or vegetables, there are none, this is a southern restaurant."}
{"text":"This place feels a bit like a \"dive\" bar, but with higher end drinks & food. I had their signature 'smoked manhattan', & it was a really delicious version of the classic with unique presentation!  For dinner I had their NY strip 'steak & frites'. The steak was cooked perfectly & the fries were definitely cut on site & really good! They also have a really good selection of bourbon & whiskey at pretty reasonable prices. Overall, I would certainly come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Just a great place to have an excellent dinner with drinks.  Tiago, owner, sources, his meat from Angus, superb butcher."}
{"text":"One of the places to go to when in Port Credit area.  Awesome bar, unique drinks ... and they're strong too ... good selection on tap, good service by fun people ... great place to chill with friends and just have a good night.   They have some good finger bar food like a cheese dips, chicken waffles, ribs, mac aand cheese etc.   There are street parking like the meter parking in front of the supermarket for $2 per hour or I'd you park across the street at the library it's free!!   If you're going to come, make sure you're not driving!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants and bars around. It has a great queen street vibe and the best drinks around."}
{"text":"You know what they say about when one door closes and another one opening? Well Port Credit, imagine that the closing of the old door of the Harp is the opening of FIFTYFIVE reclaimed wood new doors with the long awaited launch of Door FiftyFive.   For months, we all craned our neck as we drove past the old Harp at the cheeky window signage telling us that good things come to those who wait? And look at that, Door FiftyFive wasn't just blowing smoke up our corn-holes. Our patience rewarded and our prayers answered, as this new 1920's speakeasy inspired cocktail and southern food bar has taken the shores of Port Credit like storm like the Allied Forces did in Normandy.  Similar to the uphill battle faced by our boys back in 1944, Door FiftyFive has their work cut our for them in trying to introduce a hot new concept Craft Cocktails and big calorie laden flavoured meals), popular in major cities across North America into a neighbourhood transitioning slowly into one of the coolest destinations spots in the 905.  The owners, designers and management have left no stone unturned here when it comes to the  design of this place. Reclaimed wood, exposed fixtures, vintage barrels, and more, all seem to frame modern amenities (such as in table beer drafts). This seems to be a representation of what their going for here, maintaining classic presentations, flavours, and looks and then offering a modern spin on them.  This is most noticeable on their cocktail menu, which is extensive to say the least. A lengthy list of classics (avg price $12) including a negroni, a manhattan, an old fashioned, a martini and more, surpassed only by their 'modernist' cocktails (avg price $12-15) which introduces new spins on old favourites. Two must haves, for the show alone, are the Bourbon Rose (which uses dry ice in an incredible way) and the smoked Manhattan ($25) which comes with a wood chip torching fire show that will have you scrambling for your camera or smartphone.   This place isn't just cocktails, but they are boozy. 75% if the real estate on the menu is alcohol, a true speakeasy save for the password at the door. They also offer an extensive list of wine (red, white, and bubbles), bourbon scotch, whiskey and craft beer (as well as a few traditional beers for more simple tastes.   But what of that other small corner of the menu? To hold it's own against that river of booze, the food must be extra-ordinary, shouldn't it? Well it is! While the food options might now be extensive, the restaurant has decided to follow the old adage to, do one (or a few) thing(s) very well. In just two visits I've been able to try more than half the menu (not because it's that small, but because I'm a glutton).   Each dish comes out fast and perfect every time. Blackened Shrimp and Grits in a gumbo sauce, Beef Ribs, Return of The Mac (n' cheese) with Boar, cornbread muffins served with a smokey honey butter, and more, all served up quick and delicious. Note worth mentioning, some of the courses are a tad smaller and better for sharing, so ensure you express to your server your hunger level and ask how big the portions are. This is a menu that's the perfect size and price point that will allow you to order multiple items without breaking the bank.  You'd think I'd have nothing left to say, but I'd be remiss to not mention the staff here. Even after only working for less than a week, these people are on their game, bringing it every night. Offering the perfect level of service for a new restaurant, answering questions honestly, making sound recommendations based on fact finding questions, and a willingness to find out more information should they not know the answer to your question right away.  A revolution has begun in Port Credit, so the question is, what side of it are you on?  Signing off with some GTA pride  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going to Door Fiftyfive and I enjoyed it!   Our waiter and bartender were very helpful and the waiter told us that the bartender created the drinks on the menu and would be more than happy to alter them around as we chose. He also told us that the bartender was within the top 10 mixologists in Ontario. A lot of the drinks had bourbon or gin in them. While I'm not a hug fan of either, both the bartender and waiter recommended the \"garden of eden\" as the sweetness and floral tastes mask the gin. It had a lot of alcohol in it but all the taste was masked with the different notes which I really enjoyed. I recommend this drink and would get it again and again.   If you're up for the challenge of 5 oz and want to spend $25 on a drink, I'd recommend the \"smoked Manhattan\". They light the drink as the name implies and cover the fire with the drink to allow it to smoke. Watching the drink get made is quite an experience.   Next came the food experience: I ordered the Caesar salad with shrimp and watermelon. This dish was quite the experience. The shrimp was spicy which made the watermelon an excellent pairing. Overall, I recommend this dish. My friend got the macaroni salad which was quite the small portion and I felt rather tasteless so I'd recommend going with another dish if you are debating this one.   As for dessert, we got the pumpkin donuts with dulce de leche. I'm not sure if we got a bad batch or if it was over cooked, but we didn't taste the pumpkin and it had a strange after taste. I had high expectations for this dish but was rather disappointed.   Overall, I recommend this place and would gladly go again. We also enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"Always a great time, tasty food and amazing drink selection. It gets very busy on Friday and Saturday, best to get in early to avoid a lineup!"}
{"text":"The decor of this establishment is sort of like a hipster saloon. The dim lighting complimented with the antique wood decor made it feel very dark and grungy.   The atmosphere and ambience was OK , they had a live performance in the back of the restaurant so you couldn't really see much from where I was sitting in the front.   Service was mediocre at best, it took over 20 minutes before the waitress took our orders. Followed by an additional 30 minutes for our food to arrive.   Food:   notorious BIG burger ; beef patty was dry and salty  Boss platter ; figured we would order this since it came with  a wide variety of the menu items . (Ribs, brisket, sausage, fried chicken,corn bread, macaroni salad and chili) Unfortunately they ran out of the chili .  Ribs were cooked and flavored perfectly , I believe they were cooked in the smoker since I could taste the smokiness.  Macaroni salad was flavorless, I wouldn't recommend ordering this menu item.  Fried chicken was tender and crispy cooked to perfection but found it too salty.   Corn bread was moist but to sweet.   All in my experience here was nothing exceptional, I doubt I'll visit again for dinner ."}
{"text":"Found this place with an insauga article via my Facebook feed. Decided to check it out with some friends. Monday the wings are half priced: They are dry rub only two side sauce options, but they are awesome. Next time I am doing a double order of same. Today I also ordered the half ribs as my main course: what annoyed me was that no side course was included except for corn bred. However as this is a bar and not a restaurant,  meh it's ok i guess. The ribs were excellent. The chef with his houses sauces make the dishes. the prices are reasonable too, even for the drinks. I will be coming back again on Mondays for the half priced wings."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a place to bring my friend to from out of town to catch up. A friend of mine suggested Door FiftyFive, so I did my research and really liked the pictures that I saw - especially the Chicken and waffles!  The table seats were all full when we arrived, so we sat at the bar. The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable. He reached to us every now and then and also gave us some recommendations on the menu. We ordered a Garden of Eden, Chicken and Waffles, and the Wild Boar Sausage. Everything was stellar!!   Ambience: This place was dimly lit, with a cozy feel. There were light bulbs hanging on the ceiling above the bar which provided a nice design.  Food: The Chicken and waffle was a good portion to be shared. The waffle was soft and fluffy, and the fried chicken was battered to a nice crisp. The syrup on the side, when drizzled on top complemented the waffle very well. The thick gravy was also very delicious!   The Wild Boar Sausage was lean, which I really liked. It also came with imported mustard for you to dip, as well as some bread and pickled cabbage.   Drinks: The Garden of Eden was topped with a flower. It tasted slightly bitter at first, but as you keep drinking it, you can taste a bit of sweetness. It was very cute looking too!  We were very impressed with this bar as it seemed like something you'd find in Toronto. I will definitely come again! I also noticed the long line up as we left around 10:20 PM! The service was amazing, the food was delicious, and the ambience and drinks were top notch. I was very impressed. If you're looking for some classics and bourbon, and a nice place to relax, this Speakeasy style bar is the answer!"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing! Very polite and sociable. Took very good care of us! The staff is the only reason my friends and I are giving the establishment 5 stars. The crowd is questionable, a lot of fights between men & women broke out. The music is okay. Mixes were a little hard to keep up w and dance to."}
{"text":"Finally went here!!!! Not at all what I expected. This place is happening, it was busy, loud, all sorts of action going on!  We went around 9pm and there were no seats. After nine and find your own seats which I think is chaotic. We managed to find two spots at the bar. Because it was so crowded, I felt closed in a bit.  We ordered some of the funky cocktails, both were delicious. I had the garden of Eden.  Food was really appealing and how they presented it was creative. We only had the thyme fries and this turkey salad, both delicious !!! Once we left I noticed an extremely long line outside. People were waiting to get in like for a club or lounge. I def need to return, get a table and enjoy this place again!!! I found the service good as well. Connor the bartender was quick, friendly and attentive !"}
{"text":"I will have to agree with my fellow yelpers...this place is a good little hot spot  to go to in the Port Credit area!  We tried a variety of food... **Mac n cheese!  Everyone MUST get this!!!! Beef brisket Chicken and waffles Sausage  Shrimp and grits **Thyme fries!  Another must! Cornbread The only dessert they had was pumpkin fritters which were on point as well!  Our server was great!  The employees here are very friendly from the servers to the security at the door.  Drinks were great as well...great cocktails!  If you're not into liquors like whisky, gin, etc...I would probably stick to basic drinks that you're familiar with.  The cocktails are so intricate that you can taste the different ingredients in the drinks.  Even if you're not into liquors, I would still recommend trying their crafty cocktails.  The DJ was amazing tonight!!  We didn't want to leave as he was playing some really good music!  The atmosphere in here is great, everyone is there to drink, eat good food and just have a good time!  I will definitely recommend this place and it will be one of my go to spots!   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of 10.  We ordered a bottle of crown for the table. It was 120.00. The girl serving us was awesome. Very attentive and polite. Two of our friends meals were accidentally too salty. The manager came over and apologized and comped them the meals and made new ones. It's nice to be treated like a valuable customer at a bar/ lounge. A lot of places downtown have forgot how to do that which is why I love door fifty five. Everything else ordered was delicious. Wings were amazing. Their dry rub and sauces were so good and there's so much chicken on the bone. Prices were all fair. All in all great night. Great dj, will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I guess when one enters a place whose tag line is \"Whiskey, Beer, Bourbon & Kitchen\" one shouldn't be surprised to find one of the best stocked bars in the business!!! Not only did they have two of my favourite, hard to find spirits (Clase Azul tequila and Barterhouse Bourbon) but the in-house made bitter selection was pretty impressive as well! The lunch menu, while simple, offered some very different choices, most notably the Deep-fried Alligator & Shrimp Po' Boy and the Wild Boar Jerk sandwich. Unfortunately, the latter wasn't available but the waiter-recommended substitute, Smoked Brisket sandwich did not disappoint. Oh yeah, the Po' Boy was tasty as well. Really nice chunks of alligator alongside some tender shrimp, all drizzled in a spicy sauce made for fantastic sandwich! I'd go back, for the spirits or the food, in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a great location. Large drink selection but wasnt really impressed with the drinks. Tried the paper planes, smoked manhattan, and old fashioned and they were all meh. I also ordered a beer and it was very warm ( bar back said they were having issues with their taps). Will be back in the near future to see how this place has progressed, and to try the food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it but the service was a bit slow. I ordered the seafood dish with grits, it was really really good but very very expensive and a pretty tiny portion! I would be a happy customer if they either lowered their prices or increased their portions. Overall good atmosphere and the drinks were strong!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. The bar serves great cocktails and a good range of draught beers.  The decor is clean and stylish, in the speakeasy theme. The bar is now an established part of the Port Credit scene. Bands play some nights and a small patio is open in the summer. The staff are young and energetic as well as professional and courteous. This is a great night spot, and also good for weekend relaxing."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere, friendly service good food.  We tried the wings, brisket and fries.  Wings were plump and well smoked you could clearly see the smoke ring.  Brisket was fall apart tender and again nicely smoked.  The meats were so well seasoned that we didn't need to use the accompanying BBQ sauces.  One suggestion I would offer is that if you are ordering wings ask for your fries to be non seasoned.  We found that the thyme fries were heavily seasoned and when eaten with the wings which were also dusted with seasoning was overpowering.  Drink selection is impressive and the bartenders know what they are doing my Proseco cocktail was expertly made.  Decor is rustic on the verge of dive bar-ish. Sweet smoke permeates the air.  Service was very good, our server checked on us often and made sure we were well looked after."}
{"text":"checked this place out a few Thursdays ago very hip and cool vibe we got there in time for a live band to perform - they rocked! drink prices at first blow you away! but we tried some pretty neat experiences at $25 a piece (forget the names) its sort of like bar chef style but local - so I don't know if it works for sure, but good start! just a note - that one drink, I think the smoked manhattan - your hands smell like wood and other stuff, for the next few hours! the chicken and waffles were delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome place...great food & whiskey!  Menu creator told us he grew up in Spain and the food was evidence of that...lots of spices and flavor.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice.  A little noisy.  The drinks are good.  Must try the smoked Manhattan.  The food is good especially the ribs.   They are worth the trip alone.    Over all a fun bar."}
{"text":"This is a dingy pub. Worst meal of my life. There was lint all over the ribs. The fried chicken was salty. Awful atmosphere. Diners looked like they belong in a half way house or a high school in a run down neighbourhood. Bartender made me a special drink he concocted and it tasted awful. I didn't even dare go to the bathroom there."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, was packed and for good reason. Place has a great vibe, our waitress was amazing. Drinks are a must, the Pink Panther is an instant favourite. We got the Platter, mac and cheese and the cornbread cupcakes shared among 3 people and everything was excellent. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"A nice spot to have a few drinks, good food and take in some live music. Also perfect in the summer to do all of the above while out on the patio.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is really good. I got the mac n' cheese with maple boar bacon and was pretty impressed. The quality was great and maybe it was just me, but it went surprisingy well with a beer.  Prices are standard - not too expensive but not that cheap either. The atmosphere is typical of any bar - laid back and perfect for catching up with friends or even a night out."}
{"text":"Love the aesthetic, great place to have dinner with friends or for date night. My friends and I went to this location--we had the sampler, nachos and for the love of all that is good and pure treat yoself and get their cornbread: the whipped butter(?) + cornbread = life. It was highly recommended by our waitress and I'm so glad she blessed us with this advice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and cocktails, food not so much.  Door FiftyFive is another small trendy hipster joint in Port Credit. They offer great cocktails, especially my favourite, Moscow Mule (with ginger beer made in house, you can taste the difference). The beer is very cheep in comparison to similar places and that is the reason for many praising reviews. FiftyFive's food is bland even to regular bar standards and it will only taste great after a few pints.  Do go for a night out but have dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"So it all started one Friday evening when we decided to meet a few friends in Port Credit for dinner.  It was a hot summer night and we didn't have reservation to any restaurant.  For those of you who have been to Port Credit on a hot summer night especially the weekend, im sure you know its hard to get into any restaurant without either a long wait or a reservation.  After trying at a few different restaurants we finally had some luck at Door FiftyFive.  Being my first time I didn't know what to expect so I was expecting typical bar food.  Oh man was I wrong.  Yes as it had a bar atmosphere the drink menu was very extensive and had many choices from your simple drink to drinks that are as fancy as it gets.  We ordered a few different items to share among the 4 of us.  The Mac and Cheese was the best I've had.  This was my first time having chicken and waffles so I don't really have much to compare it to but their chicken and waffles were as good as it gets.  Now on to the important part.  The BBQ.  We ordered a platter with a few different meats.  I was in meat heaven.  It was all cooked to perfection.  RIbs were awesome,  Everything was very tasty and on point.  I will be back very soon and this time im eating the platter all to myself LOL"}
{"text":"Located at the heart of trendy Port Credit, this place is surrounded by other bars and restaurants that make for a lively outing.  This is a happening place which I would attribute to their awesome food, great ambiance, eclectic decor and large patio.    Whether you visit during the daytime or at night, you will not be disappointed.  During the daytime, enjoy the outdoor patio, weather permitting, or should the weather be uncooperative, you will definitely enjoy the inside decor and warm, cozy ambiance of the interior.  They have hanging light bulbs which are interesting, but one quirk I have about the lights is that they flicker, which can be distracting.  I visited this place both during the day and at night.  At night, the place is bustling, lively and a good night outing.  I definitely recommend the bbq platter for two.  The quanity and quality is to die for!! Everything in that platter was awesome.  The mac and cheese, the sauces, the distinct flavours of the different bbq's, everything!!! But if you have to try just one thing, then I would recommend you try the fried chicken.  Yum!!!!!  The service was not too great, the last time I went.  Even though we advised that everything should be brought out at the same time, they brought out the chicken wings as appetizer first.  Considering that I was and my companions were starving, this was not great at all.  The staff didn't come around, we had to flag them down with great effort.  The manager advised that it was his fault as he told the staff to bring the chicken wings first, however, we advised him that we told our server to ensure that all food come out at the same time.  Because of this debacle, we were eyeing each others food hungrily.    Anyway, there was some leftover from the platter for two and the food was awesome so I still give this place a four star.  Service definitely needs to be amped up and our server should have come around and spoke up about our request to have all food served at the same time."}
{"text":"This place has all the ingredients for a solid 4.5/5 stars rating!!There is no way you can go here and leave unhappy, at least I want to believe so!  So I went here after reading Kris/Stephanie's reviews and was absolutely satisfied with what I was offered!  Let's begin with the ambience, this place has such a welcoming and cozy feeler to it.The lighting of the bar gives it such a cool effect to the place.And the late night band gives the place more life!I walked in on a weekday and believe me this place was packed!This for me is the biggest indicator of a successful joint!  The service by our bartender was absolutely amazing..he made sure he reached to us every now and then.He also gave us some recommendations on the menu.He was energetic and quick and gave us outstanding service.  The food that we ordered came out quick and was absolutely delicious.We came here after dinner so we weren't too hungry but after coming here I had to try their cornbread cupcakes and chicken waffle.Both the items were cooked to perfection.  The cornbread cupcakes were bite size topped with jalapeños bits.They were crisp from outside and moist from inside and were served were smoked honey butter.  And the chicken with waffle was a generous size entree which me and my husband shared.The chicken was battered in pimento/hot sauce and was beautifully fried.The waffle was perfectly made and the maple syrup complemented the combination well.The best part was the thick gravy!I shall be coming back here to have more of this!  I guess I covered the service, ambience and taste!All three met my expectations.This is definitely a place where you will want to return after the first visit.Kudos team Fifty Five for putting such  an amazing show!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get some dinner and a few drinks to wind down the week. So I decided on Door 55 in port credit. This place is my happy spot, crafted cocktails and great food. I started off with a Sazerac made with lot 40 and Dhillons absinthe. Made to perfection. Ordered the Boss platter. It has a bit of everything. Ribs , fried chicken, briskets and sausage. Fries and chili. It's was good for 2 but we had left overs.I then ordered a vieux carre.for dessert.  Over a satisfying meal. Would recommend. Yum!    Note- This review is solely the opinion of the reviewer and NOT the opinion of Yelp or any of its staff."}
{"text":"Pretty busy for opening weekend!!! The tables are full and the paper menus are being studied for the best craft cocktail and gastro pub choices available.  I settled on an Old Fashioned and the Return of the Mack Maple Board Bacon & Cheese and pickled veggies. My dining companion chose the beef ribs and cornbread cupcakes.  The fact that their menu is paper and says August menu on it makes me very excited for next month's new food and cocktails menu.   The service was friendly and genuine. My server's red lip smile made me excited to try this new place! Also I was really gunning for a place that holds its own in this category in sauga. Others have come in with a bang but then faltered after a few visits.   The inside is low ceiling and high chairs with gorgeous wood tables and wrought iron detailed walls. One wall was covered with books ;) inner nerd goes yay!  Mac n cheese got creamier and creamier as it went. The corn bread came with a nice sweet butter, pickled veggies were delicious in a mini mason jar. I was meh about the brisket, the flavor was there but half fat half meat is a little bit much for me.   The condensation in the restaurant made little droplets form on the ceiling and drop down once in awhile, but they were aware of it so I'm sure it'll be resolved soon.  There were dry ice drinks and beef ribs on the menu to try for next time!!! Overall pretty solid place with lots of drink choices ;) food prices are fair and have a lot of creativity to it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and lively spot.   Owner is super cool, and his staff are lovely.   Great food!   We had the ribs (fall off the bone) and wings (lots of meat) Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails loved the smoked Manhattan the food was good.  The grits was great  Oddly enough the hot dog was outstanding!  The chicken and waffles was meh but portion was good.  Serve was ok lagged on the last round. Dripping water off the ceilings is a bit of downside.   Given the dripping ceiling and service can't go higher.  Recommended to sit at the bar"}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE bar!!!! I love the prohibition theme with the decor, the live music and cocktails/craft beer selection! They are doing so well that they are opening a second location in streetsville! I'm super excited about that. My favourite drink is there smoked manhattan. It's a pricey drink but definitely worth the try, especially for the presentation!!!  The food is also on point! Have a southern style menu with great eats! Lots of shareable foods that compliment there amazing cocktails.  My girlfriend always gets the pink panther cocktail because apparently it's \"super good and gets me drunk off of one drink!\" I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Not prepared for reservations, unstaffed and unorganized (we were in a group of 16).  I ordered their beef brisket, so $14 it was a huge portion and delicious!!!!!! Buddy of mine next to me had the mac and cheese, we passed it around - it wasn't loved as my beef brisket.    Another pal ordered the chicken and waffles, that for some reason took 45 minutes to get to us. Some exotic rare bird they had to catch must it been haha.   I would return but not with such a big group.  Parking is along the street. Staffs were friendly with good attitude. Kudos to the bartender who was very generous with the alcohol to drink ratio the birthday boy got wasted!!"}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing especial about this place. Prices don't match the quality and presentation. The burger was nothing especial. Ribs were ok too. I wouldn't comeback  I will stick to The Keg or Joey Sherway  And save my money."}
{"text":"So initially when we got here I thought I would have to deduct a star for service because it was seat yourself and then no waitress came by for a solid 20 minutes. However, when she did come and the food and drinks came there was just no way I could take the star away! The waitress was very nice and attentive after the initial wait.  Let's start with the decor, they have a good patio, you walk in and there is quite a bit of seating. It is done in the style of the Prohibition Era and it looks awesome! Exposed bricks, extremely cool lighting everywhere, the bar staff have bow ties and suspenders on. They are just spot on with the look of this place. You will be amazed with the amount of bottles behind the bar too, I don't recall ever seeing that many before! The drinks - the menu for drinks is huge and sure to please everyone. They are however pricey. The smoked Manhattan is a whopping 25.00, which is too bad because when I looked at it online I really wanted to try it until I saw the price. We ended up getting The Garden of Eden and The Pink Panther. The Garden of Eden has edible flowers, beautiful presentation (takes a while to make), it has such an interesting flavour because of the pink pepper but I loved it. The Pink Panther is the perfect summer drink, but warning it's about the size of your face! They are both quite strong so you are getting a decent bang for your buck. The food - oh gosh the food. I got the Mac n Cheese sans the boar meat. It comes in a cast iron skillet and it was SO good. It was super crispy on top and creamy inside. It is very filling as well, I had to give away a few bites. We got the corn bread to share with jalapeño and cheese in it with a honey smoked butter to put on. Why isn't all butter honey smoked butter!? Because it's freaking amazing! My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and with my coaching managed to finish it but he was struggling at the end! He said that it was great, the chicken is coated in a pimento and hot sauce mix first (gives it a red layer when you cut in so don't worry it's not under cooked) then it is breaded. They give you real maple syrup not table syrup and gravy on top. The food is quite reasonably priced it's just the drinks that are super expensive. This place is great though, I would definitely come back and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere, could be a little bigger...food is really good and the cocktails are very well done."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat on lakeshore close to hurontario. They have street parking but also free parking at the end of hurontario, and it's a short walk to the restaurant (10 mins). The place is quirky and unique, the environment great. Servers were nice and food came out fairly quickly. Drinks look very good but are on the expensive side, we ordered one of the cheaper canned beers for $5 called fifty five monkeys or something and it was delicious. We ordered the cornbread cupcakes and the nachos as apps which were also super delicioussss. Unfortunately I had a few mishaps with the rest of the food. First off I ordered the vegetarian version of the grilled cheese mac and cheese which is a grilled cheese sandwich with mac and cheese in the middle (amazing), but when the meal came out it was the standard mac and cheese in a bowl. The server offered to swap it out but it looked delicious and I was fairly hungry so I decided to keep it. My first bite tasted like bacon which grossed me out since I was vegetarian, and upon inspecting the bowl more I picked out even more bacon pieces inside. I told the server and asked if I could just get my original order for the grilled cheese, which she did. It came out a little while after but the fries that were with it came to the table when I was done eating at the end, so I just ended up taking them home. They didn't do anything on the bill to make up for the meat in my food or getting the wrong dish in the first place, which was pretty disappointing. Probably would be back to give it one more shot eventually, based on this experience I wanted to give three stars but the environment and food was so good I bumped it up to four. Without all the issues I had I would've given them five stars easily."}
{"text":"Perfect speakeasy bar in port credit; especially if you're sick of the clubs and pubs. Heavy hipster vibe; Thursday's live band caters to a young crowd which is nice considering the other restos target Cougars and sugar daddies. Food is decent; good for absorbing those manhattan and shots of jacks."}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner and was expecting a proper smoked meat joint. My fiancé cooks alot of smoked meat so we know what legitimate smoked meat should taste like.  Interior decor is great. But once the food came out it was disappointing. Wings had no Smokey flavour and were reheated. Ribs had barely any bark, gave us the bearst bone and caused difficulty cutting. In addition, there was no Smokey flavour. Bbq sauce was subpar as well. I had the smoked turkey and brie salad and I struggled to finish the plate. The smoked turkey and brie just had an odd combination to go with a green salad. As a result, mixed greens were soggy and smoked turkey (which had no smokiness and tasted rubbery) made it a struggle with every bite. Overall just a bland salad. Same goes for the watermelon ceasar...again, a soggy salad.  I am usually not a very pick eater and try to enjoy all food and but these plates were hard to finish with pleasure. The only best part was the ceasar drink.  Reviewers on yelp had me hyped up for a proper smoke house bbq joint but I guess we'll just stick to our own smoker at home.  However, staff and service were attentive and polite.  Sorry, but I won't be returning back here."}
{"text":"While I give these guys a tip of the hat for opening something reputable in Mississauga. I do dock them for originality. The original smoked manhattan did not originate here. Rather it originated in Toronto's Barchef, and it would be different if they at least named it something different or did a different presentation but, they didn't even try to do that! They literally copied the drinks essence and presentation to a tee. That I find lack lustre in originality and innovation from their bar team. No need to copy others be your own brand and your own bar. Frankie Solarik is a Genius and while they may say his drink inspired there's anyone who had had Frankie's will know this much more than an inspiration."}
{"text":"To get a good drink with a good atmosphere usually you would need to drive down to Toronto. But not anymore! Door Fiftyfive is the new cocktail bar in Port Credit and its incredible.   This place is a very relaxed area, with great cocktails ranging from your classic Old Fashioned to a smoked Manhattan. They also have flights of whiskey/bourbon for all whiskey lovers. I've also had difficult in finding places that can make a good cocktail and now there is finally a place nearby. They also have beer tabs on the tables! so you can self serve beer, this isn't something you see very often.  The food menu unfortunately is not that extensive, its a small list of items that is overshadowed by their great drink selections. The menu is between $5 - $10 for starters and $15 - 20 for the main. My favorite is the beef brisket, its been smoked for hours and each bite has a fantastic smoke flavor with some hints cedar.   They also have a great chicken and waffles that everyone needs to try! It was deliciously deep fried and served with a spicy gravy and a soft crispy waffle. If you've never had chicken and waffles before, this is going to set your standards high!  With the opening of Door Fiftyfive a bit of the Toronto restaurant culture has finally reached the GTA! The new hot spot in Port Credit."}
{"text":"I don't drink, so if you find me at a bar, it's because of the food or the 1/2 off appetizers during happy hour.  What drew me to this place was the Blackened Shrimp and Gumbo Cheddar Grits. Now let me start off by saying that I hate grits; but I was always curious about the combination of shrimp and grits, especially since they're popular in the South. I LOVE Southern cooking, so I was willing to put aside my previous experience with grits to try something new.   Very laid back atmosphere; come in and seat yourself then the waiters in baseball shirts and caps will come along and take your order. Interesting mix of people: business people in suits, Goth girls, and regulars in plaid shirts and jeans. The live music was LOUD so we opted to sit farthest away from the stage. The guitarist was pretty good playing a variety of music from county,  rock and I even heard one of the songs from the movie Breakfast Club.  HUBBY AND I SHARED: - Blackened Shrimp and Gumbo (tomato broth) Cheddar Grits which also came with mussels. The mussels were briny (bleh) but tender, the shrimp were meaty but not as fresh as I would like (Hey I'm from Socal) but the grits turned my world upside down! It was love at first bite OH MY MY MY! I would have never imagined that I would be a fan of savoury grits. - The Capone Brisket Sandwich came with a mix of sweet potato and regular potato fries with a side of delicious Smoked Horseradish Alabama Sauce. The brisket was piled high but the meat was on the dry side. It was missing the Jack Daniel's bbq sauce, so I used the sauce that came with the fries. The sandwich combined with sauce had good flavor.    Lots of delicious sounding items on the menu, great atmosphere and a cool mix of people. Whether you come to drink or not, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Super hip atmosphere, entirely hipster staff (meh, I don't mind), and good food. Really diggin the portion sizes and choices of whiskey... like hundreds!"}
{"text":"Went to try out the chicken and waffles, with a side of cornbread muffins. Overall the place was a little to 'casual' for my liking. Beer bottle label backdrop and tables made from reclaimed 'tooled' tables, complete with crevasses to catch any food scraps that don't make it to one's mouth.  The chicken was crispy (double breaded /fried southern style ) and the waffle was nothing to complain about either. No issues but it didn't leave me wanting more.  The cornbread muffins (4) were larger then the photos depicted here on another review. Soft warm and served with honey butter.   Overall not bad. But also not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Sometimes in the 'small town' of Port Credit, locals get used to things being the same and meet change with mixed response. But, I think, even the naysayers will be converted after they step foot in this new Whiskey, Beer, Bourbon Kitchen. It's prohibition era style is strangely fresh! They've perfected the lighting, music and decor.  The drink menu is extensive and impressive. Ranging from a Coors Light on draught to a Smoked Manhattan (you'll want to watch this one being made), anyone can find a drink to suit them.  And then the food! We were lucky enough to try a few dishes and I still can't pick a fave. Seriously, hats off to the chefs.  The servers are super friendly and educated on all aspects of the bar and menu.  If they are able to maintain this level of quality and service, they will do well in this little village for years to come!"}
{"text":"I guess I missed the memo or didn't do my research, because I was under the impression this was a regular bar/restaurant type deal when in fact it was a God awful nightclub.  Complete with BRO's with face tatoo's fist pumping eachother, all the way through a cramped lineup to a shitty old washroom that doesn't even have a lock on the stall and has barf & urine all over the place.  Wife asked the muppet behind the bar (guy with slicked back hair and a tiny t-shirt, Jax Teller wannabe guy) what $17 cocktails he recommends and he replies with \"Well it's whatever you like really\"..  Ya don't say?  What insight, they don't hire just any old chimpanzees to work here eh?  Beers were awful, people everywhere drinking these weird unbranded Flying Monkey's tallboys which tasted like tin can mixed with metal filings.  Food was barely OK, the cheese sticks were ice cold when they arrived, cornbread muffins really good, ribs were decent if lukewarm.  All in all, I am puzzled and quite disappointed by the recommendations here on Yelp, these 5 star reviews are baffling to me..  Was this some kind of YELP function here or something?    This place is not five stars.  Not even close"}
{"text":"I have been such a fan of Port Credit in the last little while - every time I think about coming to Door FiftyFive I've gotten side tracked but I finally made it in!  It was a sweltering hot day and the doors were open so it wasn't really so cool inside the restaurant. We choose to sit inside because it was just too hot to sit still outside - but as I said, being inside didn't really help.  This place has nice decor, it is a little dark inside and the lights flash (maybe that tells the waiter that food is ready?), but overall it's a cool looking place with some high wood table and a cute patio area. I do remember the washrooms being a little weird and dark - but hey I didn't spend a lot of time in there so whatever!  There were a lot of items on the menu that we wanted to try. We decided to each grab a beer and decide on the food. Honestly we waited quite a long time in between ordering drinks and good. It was not busy at all - but there was only one waiter on staff. He did let us know that he was short that day, but since it wasn't so busy it didn't really seem like an issue to us.   The food has a Southern flair feel to it - one of the first places I have visited in a while that has this feel so I was pretty excited! We weren't starving so we ordered chilli, cornbread cupcakes, and chicken wings to share. The wings were quite large and the sauce was really tasty. The cornbread cupcakes were so good and not too dense. The chilli (came with nacho chips) was my least favourite, but it wasn't terrible. I don't particularly think that the food was out of this world, but I definitely want to go back and try a few more items.  I'd like to see if I could give a few more stars next time around - I just didn't see all the hype unfortunately with this visit!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Great atmosphere and amazing cocktail selection. I highly recommend the smoked Manhattan. It is very tasty and well work the price. Got a little crowed later in the night. If your young and into not being able to move or here the person next to you then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant yesterday after the yelp recommendations. I was not disappointed! We ordered \"The Boss\" platter which consisted of various BBQ'ed meats and in house picked vegetables and coleslaw. The meat was cooked well, with a rich smoky flavour and delicious BBQ sauce. We also ordered their chicken and waffles, definitely a must try! The chicken was seasoned to perfection on top of a warm and fluffy waffle. We also ordered the corn bread muffins to share. Now, I am a fan of corn bread however when I usually order it in restaurants, it is very dry. At this restaurant, they come out hot and fresh with a honey butter which completes each bite. Our server Sam was warm and welcoming and very attentive to our needs. They also have a great selection of whiskey's, bourbons and beers. The atmosphere is very Queen West with good music and a laid back environment. This place has something for everyone!  I look forward to coming back to try their shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on drinks and atmosphere - I did not eat at Door Fifty-five. This is my new favourite place for a drink. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. It was quiet but music was going. The bar staff are fabulous. Funny, easy going, engaging. Andrew let us pick the music (of course we made amazing picks...I'm sure he would have taken over if we hadn't). There were other people but not many when we first arrived. Over the hour people started coming in so I assumed it gets busy for dinner. Funky decor, nice and bright in the front during the day. Great spot for a date, for a work gathering, a birthday, whatever."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on the weekend for a friend birthday and absolutely loved it.  It is a speakeasy-style bar and the washroom definitely shows that (very unique).    Our server was the best I've ever had!  Very courteous, welcoming, attentive and humourous.  My girlfriend and I ordered the cornbread cupcakes, mac n cheese, and the must have Chicken n Waffle.  The cornbread was soft and fresh out of the oven, complimented with their creamy butter.  Absolutely loved it, and wish I could get these in larger batches to take home to eat as snacks.  The mac n cheese was what you'd expect creamy cheese sauce on tender macaroni topped with more cheese on the top and baked to perfection making a crunchy and gooey surface.  Lastly,  the holy grail of this meal, the Chicken n Waffle.  You get a generous portion of fried chicken which was very crispy on the surface and the meat was moist as expected.  The sauce has a rich gravy flavor and it also had a little kick of heat to it as well.  The waffle had a crunchy surface, while still having a soft center.  When eating this you would have to eat a bit quicker and not let it sit too long as the sauce and syrup would make both the chicken and waffle soft (this is unavoidable, but I would have enjoyed it more if I could enjoy it slowly).  Overall a solid 4 stars because I found the dishes a bit small, but would come back for more in the future."}
{"text":"I went on a recommendation of a friend.  This is one of the restaurants that you have to try.  The food is divine and you don't leave wanting more.  Had a steak there and it was much better than most steak houses I have ate at.  They don't try and fancy the food up or over season the meat. It was just cooked perfectly so you get a bit of a seasoning on the outside but can actually enjoy the taste of the beef inside.  We also had this starter that was sort of like natchos with a creamy cheese like dip.  Our friends ordered it so I am not sure what it was.. but it was an explosion of taste in your mouth.    Just blown away"}
{"text":"Must. Try. The Pink Panther! So yummy, but not if you're driving... Everything on the menu is delicious. The decor is neat, lots of eye candy to enjoy. The staff is really knowledgable and friendly. The patio in the summer is the perfect spot to people watch and enjoy drinks with friends. Fairly close to a parking lot, nicely convenient. The live entertainment that night was a ska band, can't remember their name but they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Overall loved the bar and gets a huge thumbs up!   The drinks were very creative (though I didn't order the fancy ones and got a rum and coke instead) and my friends all seemed to enjoy theirs.  The service is fantastic. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. What makes it even better was the decor and ambiance which had a rustic feel to it.  The food was a hit and miss for me unfortunately. My friends got the chicken&waffles, and brisket which were both delicious. I got the thyme fries which was more than disappointing, as more than half of it was burnt and had absolutely no seasoning.   Lastly. I would comment on the price (not that it affected how I loved the place), just a heads up that it is not a cheap bar!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Door Fifty Five for a while now, so I decided that I would stop in and check it out. They are known for their cocktails, but their food isn't bad at all. I had their Chicken and waffles which were really good. The mix of the fried chicken and the sweetness from the waffles made a great combination.   Now to the cocktails, they have a great range of different types of cocktails from the classics like old fashioned  and Negroni to more modern like the crowd favorite paper plane and the experimental Smoked Manhattan which they smoke in house.  Overall if you are looking for a interesting cocktail bar in Mississauga this should be on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.   We ordered the yam fries, which were not much to be desired.   Mac n cheese is good, but not memorable.  My favourite dish is the chorizo chilli with their chips. I dream about this dish every night. This is MUST ORDER. It's good for sharing, but I refuse to do so.   I had the pink panther which tasted amazing, but I got sloshed.   They also had apple cider, didn't try the one on draft."}
{"text":"Wow. The atmosphere here is perfect. Each piece of decor, each song, each dish, each bottle, each light, has been so carefully selected and placed to make such a warm, dark, and wonderful speakeasy kind of feeling. The food was impeccable. I could have had 20 of those cornbread cupcakes. The thyme fries with the mix of sweet potato and yukon were excellently seasoned. The brisket was so well seasoned, although it got cold quickly and we had to ask to reheat it. A side of a bright acidic note would work great with it. The waffles in the chicken and waffles (with the Wu Tang W on the menu, I highly appreciated that) were fluffly like pancakes. Perfect Quebecois syrup. I'd ask for the gravy on the side just because it sogs up the chicken batter. The chicken was incredibly flavourful. I can't forget the service though... very welcoming and easy-going. The chef added so much more detail to the menu. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I's go to place when having a night out in Port Credit! The food and drinks are great, service is good, great bar atmosphere later at night - all in a great location! I love their prosecco cocktail! My only complaint is that you have to wait a while to be seated sometimes because it's always so busy but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Good place in Port Credit to meet up with your buddy to grab some pints, chat and catch up, while listening to some live music(if that's the night) and eating some good eats.   Lively crowd. Good vibe."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for work in the airport area. Needless to say there is nothing to do or cool places. This place had amazing food, a great selection of craft beers, and wonderful service. Also, it had ambience !!! Only 20 min from the airport area."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much about this place so I thought I'd organize a dinner here with some friends.   The atmosphere is that of a typical bar/ lounge. The service is great, staff were all very approachable.   I had seen pictures and reviews about their chicken and waffles. I ordered that and found it okay. The breading on the chicken was very salty and slightly unappetizing the more you ate. The waffle I got was slightly burnt underneath. I wouldn't say I was impressed by my meal.  My husband ordered the Notorious B.I.G and I had a  few bites of that. That was delicious. The patties were juicy and all the flavours just married so well together.   If you're thinking about going, I would recommend the Notorious B.I.G."}
{"text":"What a shithole. From beginning to end this place was a nightmare. They let 15 people out and 1 person in. Waited in the line from 1030 and got in at midnight. The bartenders were rude. My girlfriend got kicked out. But literally. Was shoved to the curv by someone 3x her size and shes not a threat.. tried to have a reasonable convo with the owner and that too the owners friends were rude af. Will never return. This place has so much potential but is a literal shithole."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in the world! (Ok in Ontario.... Next to my home) to eat, drink, and have fun!    The ambiance is truly unique (1920s speakeasy) and they have amazing entertainment all week long! Live music and DJs to serve a variety of tastes and interests... Which is amazing but what really sets these guys apart is their food and their drinks!!  This IS NOT the place to go for a brew and to watch the game... This is the place to go if you want to tease your palate..... Impress a date..... Hang with coworkers after a long day.... Or celebrate one of your amazing life moments!!  Food: I hope I remember this right but their beef and pork are smoked for 7+ hours (all natural ingredients) before being served in wonderful ways from ribs, to brisket ... Sausages made in house too!! My favorite? Farmaggedeon!!! It's a combination of all their meats and sausage layered onto homemade bread, smothered in cheese and the most incredible bourbon infused gravy on the planet, topped with an egg... My description can't do it justice. Trust me you need to eat this!! Chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits ... The list of food options is short but mighty!  Drinks: they have an entire cage full of bourbon- need I say more? Yes? The also have dozens of vodkas, tequilas, and everything in between. The Master Bartender Mix is truly a mixologist and has won numerous bartender awards. Try out the Smoked Manhatten (smoked table side for your pleasure) or his take on a mint julep, Negroni (another personal fave) and more!   I could keep writing about how great this place is... But honestly, what would you rather do... Read about it or try it? Off you go now...."}
{"text":"poor customer service.  the manager cant even answer emails, both the manager and general manager. they say one thing and do the opposite which is AVOIDANCE of their customers."}
{"text":"I am so happy to welcome Door Fifty Five as one of my new Port Credit favourites. The drinks are imaginative and delicious and while the food menu is limited every item on there is thought out and executed to perfection!"}
{"text":"One of my first 5 star reviews in a while. This place exceeded ALL expectations. The restaurant/bar and patio were nice. The drink \"Pink Panther\" was delicious. The Chicken n Waffles, and the Shrimp Po'Boy were to DIE for! Absolutely incredible. Will definitely be back here. Might be my new second favourite place on Lakeshore (And that's saying a lot if you know all the hidden gems on Lakeshore)."}
{"text":"I have tried this place on a weekday evening with a girlfriend. The atmosphere was ok . The food was very average. Not what we expected. The dinning room and seating area is not very big and it's too dark. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"I'm really not a bar person.  Dunno why, but I just never went through that phase where I'd meet up with friends, a date...at a bar.  Maybe it's a suburban/went to a commuter school thing?  Anyway, despite being slightly intimidated by bars, I just *knew* I had to check out Port Credit/Mississauga's newest hot spot!  My visit was on a Tuesday night with a coupla old friends for a catch up.  I honestly thought this place would be dead, but the extended Summer weather definitely helped.  Patio was at least 3/4 full and with the exception of 2-3 tables in the front + the entire back - where the music seemed waaay louder - was pretty much empty.  I think Dufton was our server as per the name on the receipt.  He was very friendly and helpful in narrowing down our decision from the extensive drink menu.  Like the other reviews, there are only a handful of food items on the menu.  I had the Pink Panther ($15) and honestly, that was probably all I was able to tolerate as it's a HUGE drink.  The top note tasted like an alcoholic orange juice, then with a bit of raspberry, so it's a fruitier drink.  Perfect for Summer!    As we had a few sips of our cocktails, I wanted to order something to share so server suggested the fries over the mac 'n cheese which was a good call.  Fries were SOOO good, well seasoned/fried, perfect for sharing.  Being slightly intoxicated while at this place definitely helped amplify my impression.  Good service also goes a long way!  Note:  Yes, the condensation at the back was apparently my issue.  And the washrooms, towards the back, had some issue as well as the carpet was completely soaked AND it was absolutely freezing back there.  I hope they address this sitch before it begins to freeze over!"}
{"text":"The roast tomato poblano cheese dip tastes like cheese wiz. Might as well just buy nacho cheese dip and make this at home and add tomatoes in it."}
{"text":"We have tried enough dishes here to know that Door 55 is not our thing. Our  Poblano cheese dip was maybe 1/3 finished when we handed it back to our server to clear room on our small table for a shared pork rib dish that was certainly tastier than aforementioned appetizer. Our server was truly friendly enough but she was one of those \"fast talkers\" who curiously also left out every 4th or 5th word from would make sense as a complete sentence as a response to all our questions. I can see Jerry, George and Elaine reeking havoc with her;)"}
{"text":"First off I want to say that the review I'm posting is based on one time and one server, and not the other 2 times I have visited before tonight.  I will start by saying I love the atmosphere, drinks, and music, and will keep coming back here.  But if what I experienced tonight was after my first time visiting, or a regular occurrence, I would not/will not be back.    My friend and I were met with a server tonight that forgot our order twice and was more interested in settling bills with his tables than getting drinks out for the tables that were still there.  We came in around 11 to meet friends and were told who our server was, we waited a good while before he came to our table.  He took our order and proceeded to the bar, after about 5 minutes he came back to our table and asked us what we ordered again.  Honest mistake forgetting drink orders, no biggy... he returned with our drinks but screwed up the order, so my friend had to wait until he surfaced again to tell him her order was wrong.  He apologized and brought her right drink order, brownie points!  Everything went ok until we needed another drink, he didn't surface AGAIN for about 30 minutes (was busy at the bar settling up bills) and when he came over he took our orders, but this time forgot about them.    By this time our other friends had to leave so approached the bar to settle up, my friend and I waited for our drinks but never got them, but I was able to get my drink after he came up to us expressing concern about two other people that were at the table with us (but we didn't know) because they didn't pay their bill, I slipped in my drink order in and a few minutes later and got half of it (the shot without the chaser) and stood around with the shot for about 20 minutes trying to find him to get the chaser and my friends drink order before shooting it and walking up to the bar to get our bill.  I gave a tip (that was enough for my friend and I) and my friend didn't.    Honestly after the lack of service we received tonight I didn't blame her.  As we were getting ready to leave the server happened to reappear and walked up to her and told her \"In Canada, we tip.\", then when he passed by us he muttered something else to us that I am not going to write here based on assumptions, but lets just say it wasn't a nice word.  Listen, get off your high horse.  You forgot our order and disappeared for a good chunk of the night, unlike our server last time who came to check up on our table numerous times and was very attentive.  She received a good tip because she deserved it.  You received nothing because of your lack of service.  To your response to my friend, \"in Canada, we serve\"."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for a girls night out. We came here to check it out because of all the reviews. It was our first time here and we didn't really like the food. We felt like the food was overpriced and didn't taste good. We ordered chicken and waffles. There was so little chicken. There was bone and very heavily battered. The fries were burnt. The rice dish we ordered, the rice was very hard and was supposed to come with sausages but there was none.   The food was not great but the atmosphere was live.   This place is probably better for drinks than food. They have a huge variety of alcohol."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner based on the strength of other reviews, and I was not disappointed. The service was AAA, the food was phenomenal and then drinks were original and delicious.   The chicken and waffles is literally the best fried chicken I've ever had. The chili was smoky, spicy and served with fresh nachos. Our server was charming and seemed to be very invested in us having a great time.   Combine all the above with a top notch drink menu, and a stunning, chic decor and this place is a winner. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bad service, overcrowded and bad attitudes. Bouncers will split up groups of friends and let the females (and only the ones they deem attractive) in while making other people  wait. They'll TELL YOU they are at capacity but then let in 20 more of their friends before your whole group (I'm talking a group of 6) makes it in. I was let in while my fiancé had to wait 45 minutes in a line WHEN HE WAS NEXT TO GET IN!!!This location has the WORST bouncers and people managing the after 9pm block."}
{"text":"Great service, with some exceptional food. I had the smoked wings (very nice sized wings) loved the smokiness of them. The flavor was all the way into the meat, not just flavored skin. Then followed that up with the brisket, very tender and tasty, This was my first visit there, but surely will not be my last!!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq southern places in the gta.  And I have had chicken in Atlanta and tried the dirty bird in downtown.  The vibe is hipster and you sit on wooden stools.  The service is good and I would come back and try everything as everything from the chicken to the brisket was amazing."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and good service. We sat at the bar - had a couple of drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"3rd time here.  Great live music. Lovely atmosphere with great food and a great drink selection.  Ordered the Mahi Mahi with the rice and shrimp - the fish was tasty but a bit on the spicy side (for some, I thought it was great).   Corn bread very tasty and sweet but came out a bit cold. Minor issue.  All in all - a great place."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Came here for some late night eats and drinks to ring in a Bday at midnight and it was wonderful. Live DJ, great atmosphere, unique style and a mix between contemporary and rugged decor. The beef brisket sandwich is by far the most amazing sandwich I have had here. 24 hour slow cooked meat with delicious sauce, side of in his fries are a fade between yam fries and regular fries, crisped to perfection, and comes with a spicy mayo dip, that is delicious...ask for an extra you will need it. They have great selection of Local beers. A bit expensive on the dinning side but the quality speaks for itself. Staff are friendly and courteous. Went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't packed, so great for dates or light friendly gatherings during that day, otherwise weekends is jammed packed. Def would come back here. 5/5 enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to Door Fifty Five to have dinner with the ladies. We tried to RSVP a few days prior but they didn't take them on Fridays so I was a little annoyed when we got there and were asked if we had a reservations. We waited at the bar for about 15 minutes before being seated. Our server was nice kinda slow even with the understanding it was a Friday.. We ordered drinks & food which came out in fairly standard time. I ordered the chicken & waffles nothing crazy about it. For me it was way too much batter and not enough chicken I spend majority of the time removing the skin. the waffle was standard but the honey butter was a nice touch. Towards the end if our meal It started getting busy as it was Friday and took our waiter extra long to get back to us & clear our bills another thing that annoyed me. it's usually packed on Friday so if your looking something more quiet & laid back not the place for that. It's was a cool spot though would I come back? For food probably not but drink & convos Maybe!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with one of my girlfriends to catch up for dinner and some drinks. I've heard about this place before, and have been meaning to check it out for some time now. Must I say, this place is AMAZINGGG. I loved every aspect of my experience here.   I came to Door FiftyFive on a snowy-blizzardy night, and the only thing I found difficult was the parking.   Food- I ordered the platter (as it states it easily feeds two). This \"Boss\" Platter (~$55) included Buttermilk Chicken (2pc.) with amazing gravy, Nachos & Chili, Sausage, Beef, Ribs (8 rack)... if I'm forgetting something... it's probably because I was distracted by the abundance of flavours going on in my mouth (haha!)... no really, it was that good. Everything on that platter was excellent. I was trying to find something to criticize, but for the most part it was amazing. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. Also bought a bottle of Malbec on the side ~$29.   Service- Excellent. Was very attentive to our table. No complaints. Polite, friendly, and funny! Live music playing in the background. Acoustics! (Such a great atmosphere!!!)  Parking- Hard to find. Usually parallel to the side of the street.   MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is that was some good ass chicken and waffles. Top notch. I'm still thinking about it.  Port Credit - this is the best restaurant on the street."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for our girls night out. I love the decor. It had a cool, sexy, hipster vibe. That probably isn't the best description but it's all I've got. Our waitress was amazing and engaging. We basically wanted her to sit down and eat with us. We ordered the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, cheese dip, pink panther, smokey Manhattan and another drink but I forgot the name. I enjoyed everything but the cheese dip wasn't that great. The chicken and waffles had a nice kick to it. My friend couldnt handle the spice level but I would order it again. I loved the flavours in my shrimp and grits but wished it was served hot instead of room temperature. Regardless, I would come back I regret not trying the mac and cheese. I reccomended this place to my other friend and she LOVED it. p.s. the drinks are STRONG so there is no going wrong there."}
{"text":"Ready prices for beers. Food is so so. The braised pork I believe. Just came in a metal tin. Felt like they forgot to plate it. Could use a little more sides. Or any side for that matter. Literally meat on a tin plate. Get the chicken waffles or Mac and cheese instead. However customer service is a A+ shout ont to the skinny man with glasses! So kind and so courteous. Beer is well priced and there are many options to choose from. They often offer samples of beer f you don't know what beer you are looking for. I recommend and brig my friends here"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the chicken and waffles with smoked boar sausage. Chicken was cooked perfectly with a crisp exterior. Gravy was great and so were the waffles. Sausage was perfectly moist. Cocktail was strong but tasted really good. The decor was amazing too. Friendly bartender who kept us entertained throughout the night. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and the atmosphere is super trendy. Great for parties and groups, can get a bit loud on the weekends, with music pumping and fancy drinks it's really fun! Did my friends birthday here and she loved it and so did all the guests! Definitely be going back!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food and beverages. Make sure to try the Smoked Manhattan but as a shot.   Amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Experience! Gotta try the Smoking Manhattan. What an experience.   I also ordered a Margarita and it was Amazing, no artificial crap, served in an aluminium steel cup. Will definitely be returning soon and spreading the word."}
{"text":"Wow.. first off I had to stand outside in line for about 10-15min. The place was Packed! The door guy was waiting for a number of people to leave and the same to go in. The wait was worth it! The crowd was great, everyone having a good time. A lot of people were drunk and trying to hide it, haha! Lots of ladies dancing,  the crowd is mix of young and old, I like that! It was after 12am and thank God my friend is very good friends with the owner of this place. Not did he only with the best mac and cheese I've ever had but also a drink called enchanted bliss and some margarita, I forgot the name of it but I didn't end up finishing it.. I swear to you I felt sooo tipsy/drunk as if I had been drinking all night and I only needed one and half drink and I already was feeling the vibe!  Come here, enjoy the delicious drinks, they are definitely not cheap with the alcohol,  the drinks are so great, I swear to you! And please try the Mac and Cheese and thank me later! Next visit, I'm going to try the waffles and fried chicken! I highly recommend! The end!"}
{"text":"The ribs are very juicy, tender and flavorful. The wings are delightful as well. The watermelon salad is not had. The service is great. The only thing that could be improved from my visit is the men's washroom: the layout is strange, and also it was freezing and dark in there. Overall I had a great time and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I came here at around 1 in the morning so I didn't get anything to eat, but I will say their jagerbombs got me all sorts of messed up, and they were super good! The vibe here is super different from the Streetsville one - every time I've gone to the other location, they always have a singer playing some kind of country/rock setlist - this place had a DJ and were playing more popular dance tracks. I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great Ambiance if you're looking for a night out for a couple of drinks with some friends.  Lively crowds and tasty and refreshing drinks.  Some real talent behind the bar.  For the ladies try the Pink Panther (my GF loved it!) for the fellas, I really enjoyed their Old Fashion a classic.  The smoked Manhattan looks amazing!  Going to try that next time I go!    The food is tasty!  I had the Return of the Mac (Mac and Cheese with boar sausage), a very rich and creamy Mac and Cheese.  With subtle hints of salty and sweet with the maple bacon accompanied by boar sausage.    The crowd is amazing there on Friday night, people just looking to have a good time and converse, not your typical pretentious crowd of hipsters and socialite snobs.  Just good people :D"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and definitely try the Big Boss Platter! Great staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday this past weekend and didn't have such a good experience. I understand it gets crazy busy in there but when we asked where our chips and dip order was (since everyone else at our table who ordered after us got their food) she said \"it's right there\" pointing at the table next to us; expecting us to eat it after it sat there for almost 20 minutes under the breath of a stranger. I said well why is it there when we ordered it? and she responded very rudely \"it's not my fault you keep moving\" - mind you we never moved a single time the entire time we were there. I don't like being accused when the mistake wasn't on our end. The server took the chips and dip and said she'd bring out another one. But with the fear of the same order being re-heated we opted to pass on it, ate elsewhere and came back to enjoy our company instead. I think it's a good spot to grab drinks and jam to music but if you're going with a large party maybe eat before.  Might have been a one off that night but I was so upset about being yelled at!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with my fiance and although it was busy, we were seated immediately (always appreciated). The ambiance of the place is downtown-like, they had a live DJ, a couple of TVs, and interesting decor. We ordered up the Half Chicken as well as the Up In Smoke Wings, and both dishes were to die for -- especially the saffron rice! The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because of how long we had to wait for the food, approximately 30-40 minutes, but we'll definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"A friend's 30th birthday brought me here on a busy Friday night. Arrived just after 8 and sat at the largest table just past the main bar. Towards the back of the restaurant they have a DJ set up mixing an impressive amount of new and old music. My wife and I shared the chicken and waffles ($19), and the return of the Mac with boar meat ($9). The chicken and waffles came out first and was a rather generous portion. Two thick coated thighs atop a Belgian waffle with maple syrup and gravy on the side. Unfortunately our waffle was over done and was much crunchier than fluffy. The chicken had a thick coating on it which, while delicious was a bit too much for my liking. The mac and cheese arrived about 10 minutes after (mix up in the kitchen), it was good, though lacking enough boar meat. When I did get a chunk of meat, it was delicious.  I would conclude that door fifty five is better for a few drinks than a full meal, but be aware cocktails run from 12-16 dollars and beer 7- 13 dollars."}
{"text":"Lots of suburban hipsters hanging out drinking Coors Banquet. Menu is a bit too simple and is all meat all the time. No lite bites no salad here. (probably why it was 80% dudes). Bartenders are super mixologists. Go for a Moscow Mule or a specialty cocktail but eat before you go."}
{"text":"The key to door fiftyfive is its urban chic factor, located within a quaint and intimate surroundings. It has a sense of style and purpose that oozes self-confidence. It's an oasis for suburban-hipsters both young and old, who don't want to deal with the headache of a trip into the big city. But sometimes that confidence can be misplaced, glossing over  a lot of details, that if done right could make this place really great.  The best parts about this bar/restaurant is it's vibe and the great cocktails that flow from the bar. I have never had a bad cocktail here and I have had all of them (which is not a great idea if you and your friends try to do this all in one sitting, as we tried to do). The music is excellent, the dj and bands are top notch and the crowd seems always ready to have a good time.   But then the cracks start to open and you start to notice those details I mentioned. The food is erratic. The chicken is outstanding but the barbecue is average at best. You can tell that the ribs and brisket have been  mass produced and then have sat frozen for awhile. The brisket is as dry and flavourless as shoe leather. But the boss platter is well presented and the sauces are very good. The sandwiches were ok, the farmageddon was a big mess. I'd stick to the big plates. The lighting at the back of the bar is atrocious, I had to use my phone to read the menu. And the men's bathroom may have been designed to be quaint but felt more like a barnyard stall.  So as a bar and for a fun night out, I'd give this place a 5. As a restaurant it's a 3. But it's definitely worth hitting up at least once to see if it your cup of tea."}
{"text":"Came back after 4pm and the door was open, so glad we came back.  The interior is just dark enough to be romantic and the wood is warm and inviting. Our bartender recommended an old fashioned for me and the French 75 for my wife, both executed perfectly. Great place for drinks and/or dinner.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago solo. Wanted a quick bite before catching the GoTrain. Mac and cheese + cornbread cupcakes are fantastic. Excited to come back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"A bit late on my review as we went here back in early August.  Early Friday evening so the place was not crowded but I'd guess they get a good crowd judging by the bar and menu.  Great vibe and excellent selection of whiskeys.  We opted for a couple of beers and I ordered the brisket sandwich.  It was truly one of the best brisket sandwiches I've ever had with the meat smoked perfectly and so tender it just melts in your mouth.  Recommend this place and will be coming back to try a few more items and sample some of the wide variety of whiskeys."}
