{"text":"Oh, Carrie Cerinos is definitely worthy of a very good rating. The food is beyond words. My wife and I like the fact that they participate in the restaurant.com website certificate program which helps our budget go further. We have never been disappointed by Cerinos as they are true professionals and have a knack for hiring outstanding staff. In short, my family is unquestionably fans of the place and hope you will agree with me."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. Very bad planning. Hope the food is better."}
{"text":"An old fashion Italian restaurant. The food is typical and expected. The best thing this place offers is the Mamas white sauce which has a take on Alfredo sauce which is absolutely delicious and probably not very healthy, but that's usually how things work out! Definitely one of the staple and better restaurants in North Royalton."}
{"text":"Beautiful looking restaurant! However i was not at all impressed with my meal. I had the veal and I did not care for the way they prepared it. Was overall unhappy with the way most of my food tasted."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time tonight for our 7th wedding anniversary. We had both wanted to try it for quite some time and we were not disappointed. When I made the reservation I was asked if this was for an occasion and I told them. When we arrived they had a Happy Anniversary card waiting for us.  The service was outstanding and the food was fantastic.  The portions were large and they'll make a good lunch for tomorrow. When it came time for dessert, a Happy Anniversary cake with a candle was brought to our table which we did not expect. The decor was certainly \"old school\", but so was the service, and that is definitely a good thing.  Attention to detail is a lost quality in today's modern dining where they try to rush you through your meal. That was not the case here. It was a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this gem / landmark is still alive and well !! All these knit pickers need to relax this is an old establishment and isn't catering to your snobby tastes or attitudes. You really ought to ask your server what the place serves as a specialty and order that, I see allot of reviewers that think they are the next Yelp review God and are ordering \"basic b**ch\" things. Order what the place is known for, or I'd say move along to fine dining with that attitude and bring 200$ to the table to eat like a princess ! This is moderate Italian dining and is a family restaurant based on tradition."}
{"text":"As far as I am concerned, Carrie Cerino's has the best lasagna around. I have been going to Carrie Cerino's for about 15-20 years and have NEVER been disappointed with any meal I have ordered. Carrie Cerino's is a traditional Italian Restaurant, so they have all the staple dishes :   all types of pasta noodle  all types of pasta sauce  lasagna  spaghetti and meatballs  manicotti alfredo  eggplant parm  chicken parm  seafood dishes  the list goes on and on.......   They have wonderful appetizers and salad as well. They have great fresh bread and their cake is fantastic service is always very good. I have been here mostly for larger family events and the staff is very accommodating.   This is a reasonably priced restaurant with a large bar area on the fist level along with party rooms for larger gatherings. I would recommend making reservation for dinner, especially if you have a larger party."}
{"text":"Went recently for a small family event. The food was simply horrible. Chicken dish tasted foul and vegetables were over cooked and flavorless. Salad was a few leaves of iceberg lettuce with some cheese sprinkled on top. Overall a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I'm a new yelp-er and am currently reviewing all my top restaurants in Cleveland. Carrie Cerino's is the best Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. Not just because my parents wedding reception was held here, or the homemade pasta.   Chicken parm, we have had it everywhere, probably make it at home as well. Hands down, the best chicken parm these lips have ever tasted. I'm not going to go in detail about the ham, cheese, tomato, breading etc. Just strongly urge you to try this dish, everyone who has tried it has agreed with me 100%.  French onion soup, no big deal right? Wrong! It's so cheesy and delicious and I crave this all the time. I don't know what they do to make everything so delish, but over the years it has been consistent and I want some tonight for dinner.   Normally, I'm into trendy, modern, fusion restaurants. This place is straight forward, classic Italian and its all about the food, not the scenery (tends to be an older crowd). I definitely wouldn't come here for apps and cocktails. Although, it is very nice with their crystal chandeliers and banquet style decor. Go now, because they close kinda early. Viva Italia!"}
{"text":"We just had a great meal at Carrie cerino's. Homemade pasta, homemade bread. Fresh salad. Garlic bread to die for. Haven't been here in years and now sorry that we haven't been. This may become a regular."}
{"text":"An \"old school\" Italian restaurant on the South side of Cleveland.  Wife and I went there on a recent weekend, was like going back in time a bit (decor is a bit dated, but supposedly getting a re-make sometime soon).  We actually liked the old feel.  Service was attentive and friendly, staff seemed to know everybody in the place.  Meals came with bread, a salad, entree (including your choice of pasta).  My wife had a fish dish that she enjoyed, and I went with my old stand-by...Chicken Parmesan.  Although the food was tasty, it was certainly not out-of-this-world.  Prices were reasonable, and as a decent family place I'd say it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"upon entering, the hallway leading to the restaurant smelled like old folks nursing home.  Sorta like someone peed in the hallway.  Once into the restaurant, it was ok.  Service was great and food was good.   They really need to do something about that god awful smell when you first enter the restaurant/catering area."}
{"text":"It's a nice go to place for my husband and I on a date night. It's cozy & comfortable and the food is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"i was debating whether to give 4 or 5 stars only because i've been there just the one time last night. we went for my girlfriend's grandparent's 60th anniversary dinner.  there must have been near 40 of us there and the staff was gracious and remained calm even with small children running around and playing with one another. i ordered veal scallopine marsala w/ a side of spaghetting and marinara sauce. it was delicious. my girlfriend had the shrimp alla vodka. i tried it and i tell you it was really very good also.  we had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 off but the \"mother-in-law\" paid for us so we still have it to use another time. and we gladly will."}
{"text":"We had great experience and delicious dinner at Carrie Cerinos. I came to celebrate my friend's birthday. Darlene, our server, was very polite and attentive, we didn't wait long for our drinks, or appetizers, or main dish. Everything was just right. My friend said that his steak was amazing! I ate so much, I needed to do extra walk that evening. So, be prepared to have a lot of food, when you order appetizers, salad or soup, and then your main dinner. In addition to that, we got a birthday cake! It was a very nice gesture from the owners of Carrie Cerinos. The owners also checked on our table twice to see if we enjoyed the meal. Great attention to make sure the guests are happy. Thank you for a good hospitality and delicious food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Years ago Cerino's was great, now it is below average. This is our third visit. Veal piccata - very watery sauce, overcooked. Pasta side - pasta was lumped together. Will not return."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Carrie Cerino's yet?!?  Tasty Italian food that never disappoints.  I always get the Chicken Sinatra.  If you're familiar with Outback, it's like the Alice Springs chicken.  You get a side salad, a side of pasta or risotto (I always do pasta with meat sauce), and the chicken dish -- yum!  Their dessert selection is amazing and always delicious.  Service has been prompt and I've gone with large groups multiple times and they're very accommodating and willing to do separate checks.  As one of the only non-fast food restaurants in North Royalton, I'm thrilled to have it here!"}
{"text":"Went for Thanksgiving 2015. Food is very good. Checked in at 2 PM for a 2:30 rez. Told them we'd be at the bar. We were told the Lounge is closed on holidays (??!!) Called to our table at 3 PM. Service V-E-R-Y slow. About 15 minutes before we saw our server, another 20 after our drink orders for our drinks, another 1/2 hour for our meal service to start (familly-style for the holiday). Difficult to get 'refills' on the food, none on the water.  By the time they mentioned desert, we were anxious to get out!   The food was very good, the service mediocre (don't believe it was the servers fault).  Would not do this venue again."}
{"text":"They catered my wedding reception. The food is really good and they gave me a personalized menu to keep as a souvenir. It's a good place for large parties and very nice. There's a bar lounge in the downstairs area and restaurant upstairs. The people are usually friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his father a few days ago. I was so excited to go, considering I had heard such good things about it from customers at my work. I am so sorry to say that I was not impressed, nor satisfied with my meal at all. The service was exceptional, as we asked for a to-go box to take back a few items that were left on our plates back home to my boyfriend's mom, and our server gladly gave us one considering the \"no to go boxes\" signs posted on the entrance doors.   The meal started with rolls (not freshly made in house, nor where warm or hot, but no biggie here because I generally don't like rolls with my dinner) a creamy-chicken soup with rice in it which tasted similar to chicken gravy, very rich. and a side salad with iceberg lettuce, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese, two cherry tomatoes, and a slice of salami.   Nothing extravagant, yet nothing completely unappetizing.   Next, the meal came out with various thanksgiving sides and main courses typical of an all-American style Thanksgiving Dinner. I will describe each as follows:  Cranberry sauce: A cold, sloppy, bitter, too-sweet, mess. Stem-filled. No spices. No creativity. The most unappetizing of all side dishes. In-edible.   Yams (my favorite part of thanksgiving food!) : Sweet potatoes (I could tell were not canned, due in part that some of the larger pieces were not cooked all the way throughout the center) had an ever-so-slight coating of what tasted like watered down syrup. No cinnamon or spices, no walnuts, no brown sugar, no buttery coating, no toasted marshmallows on top...(give me SOME creativity!) There is so many yummy ways to serve up this dish. I was SO disappointed in this dish the most.   Stuffing: A pile of bready mush. Stove-top I ate for dinner a few nights prior was better. My boyfriend's father liked this dish.   Mashed potatoes and gravy: No complaints here. I can't say definitively that these weren't cooked from fresh potatoes, but it tasted fine. Extremely hard to mess up mashed potatoes. Gravy was fine. Appropriately salted and savory.   Green beans: Boiled to oblivion. Was not served hot. Completely unseasoned. mixed in were CANNED mushrooms. Was a watery, sloppy mess.   Turkey: Brined turkey meat. Was tender, but not a typical dryer roasted style turkey that I'm used to. Brined turkey meat is a personal preference. One that I personally am not fond of. Dark meat of the turkey: in-edible.   Ham: The only thing that I really kept eating in order to fill myself up. Honey glazed. My saving grace in all of this.  Roast beef: Didn't try. Boyfriend's dad said it was \"gristle-y\"  Pumpkin Pie for dessert: Wonderful. Tasted home-made. Flakey crust.   We reached the end of our dinner, and I didn't want to disappoint or make a big deal out of everything, so I said nothing, and I regret it. My boyfriend's check came to the table. For three of us, the bill totaled at $97 dollars. Extremely disappointing.  Will not be coming back here next year for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Had the eggplant parm (which is served in an unusual stacked form, and seemed like it had chicken as a layer; it's lucky I'm not truly vegetarian) with a side of risotto.  I'd seen the risotto as an option on the menu as a side, but it hadn't been mentioned by our server and I'd asked about it (probably a sign.) It was a little too al-dente.  The wedding soup was not exciting, and the desserts were clearly all about huge servings without much excitement; my memory could have been mistaken, but I thought I'd recognized the whipped-cream pumpkin roll at my in-laws from the local Giant Eagle grocers as looking surprisingly similar to one of the options on the dessert tray (yes, they still carry a dessert tray around.)"}
{"text":"The calamari is my favorite. It is thick and the crust is very flavorful. I suggest saving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I've lived minutes away from Carrie Cerino's for my entire life and I haven't frequented the place for whatever reason. My family decided to go tonight and I am so glad we did... The food is DELICIOUS.  Each dish comes with a soup or salad so I ordered the Italian wedding soup which was very flavorful and an interesting twist to a traditional recipe.  There was one big meatball in the middle and little bits of chicken throughout the broth. The warm bread that was brought to the table was soft and there were 2 tasty varieties (one with and one without garlic).  I ordered the gnocchi and white sauce which was absolutely a wonderful dish.  I could not have imagined something more comforting, filling, and delicious than that.  I want more already even though I'm full to the brim! It came with either meatballs or sausage, and I opted for the meatballs which were exquisite... That old school homemade flavor.  My family all really enjoyed their dishes as well, especially when our waitress told us that it's never-ending refills for sides of pasta (my dad is never one to pass up \"free\" anything... Must be the Polish blood!).  I only took a star away because of the interior design of the restaurant. I felt like I stepped back in time when walking in; it was like being in my grandmother's basement or a medieval dungeon.  It was clean and really well kept up, but it was just super old fashioned (which I guess could be part of the charm).   When we left, we bought a box of kolaczki which are, I'm ashamed to say, even better than the old recipe I make every year from scratch... Soft, flaky dough filled with the exact right amount of fruit. Delicious!"}
{"text":"As usual the food was great, celebrating my grandson's First Communion he picked this restaurant. Everyone loves the veal parm and shrimp saute is my favirite. The cake that was ordered (larger version of their give away cakes was yummy Keep up Carrie's tradition !!!!"}
{"text":"Location is a bit far from the main city, but worth every bit of the drive. Interior is very spacious with lots of party rooms.  As for the food, we had Berkshire Chop that was marvelously tender and juicy. Service was attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"Disappointed...my family used to go here every year when I was a kid. My husband & I went here for my birthday dinner at the end of February. The decor is so dark & old looking & was musty...we ate in the main room & the waitress was nice, but menu was limited, our food was not good. My asparagus was smooshy & limp like the kind that comes from a can, not crisp. My husband ordered the veal parmesean & it tasted like fish oil & was very oily but dry, if that makes sense....he had to return it because he could not eat it:( The manager's reply was to just make sure to not order anything with coating on it next time....seriously? Thankfully they took it off of our bill! The french onion soup as appetizer was good & the red wine we had was good, but again, the waitress couldn't open the bottle, that was an ordeal. We were seated at a small 2 person table that felt like we were riding in an old dark train & whenever the waitress or a customer would walk by, the table & my seat rattled, no joke. I really feel like this place needs a major restoration & if they say they are serving authentic italian food, they need to MAKE authentic italian food. I will avoid this place unless they get a makeover!"}
{"text":"The History, since I've been born, my parents have made this place a special location for special occasions. When you grow up you tend not to want to visit the places your parents took you to for whatever reasons. So I have not been here since I was a kid!  My mom insisted that we go here for her 79th birthday and we all agreed. So a party of 18 ppl it was on a Saturday night. The place was jammed packed!  The memories flooded pack into my mind of all the good times we had as a tight knit family, I loved it! Being a foodie now that I'm all grown up! The menu was one of the best I've seen in all my travels and the food quality was spot on!  Be careful in the parking lot, lots of blue hairs driving and could be a bit of an ordeal to get to and from he car! LOL!"}
{"text":"While I didn't grow up in Cleveland, from what I've heard this used to be \"the place\" for good Italian food.  But I think this place has fallen too far behind the times and can't compete with Cleveland's new foodie status.  The food was average, definitely not the best but not the worst Italian food I've ever had.  The menu is pretty typical, nothing too interesting or fresh with most meal options being on the heavier side.  But the décor has to be the worst thing of all, outdated and dingy.  I couldn't wait to leave and see some sunshine.  Overall, it was an average dining experience with nothing exceptional to bring me back ever again.  I'd much rather dine at Carabba's or Brio for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Went to Carrie Cerino's for Sunday lunch today.  They no longer have the Sunday lunch specials so you have to order off of the regular dinner menu.  My wife had the Chicken Marsala which was excellent, I had the small strip steak which I was disappointed in since it was not seasoned like it was the last time that I had it.  Service was OK, not great.  We had a Restaurants.com certificate for $25 off otherwise this would have been a one star review.  $57 with no beverages, appetizers, or dessert.  Soup, salad, and entrée portions were small even though this was supposed to be the full dinner price menu."}
{"text":"Growing up in the area, Carrie Cerino's was the place to go for a celebration.  Everything was always wonderful!  When I heard that my HS reunion would be held there, I was over the moon to have Carrie's delicious food again.  And boy, was I ever disappointed.  The meal started with salad and rolls, which were fine.  There was no bar set up in our room, and only two servers trying to juggle drink orders and serving food, so most of us wound up just going downstairs to the lounge to get our drinks.  The buffet was awful - overcooked roast beef in gelatinous gravy, sliced so thinly that you could barely get it on your fork (and you regretted doing so once it was in your mouth).  Roast chicken and green beans almondine were OK.  Potatoes au gratin were bright orange - I think they used the cheeze packet from a box of Kraft macaroni.   The pasta with white sauce was OK, but not worth an upcharge. The pastries on the dessert tray were OK.  The servers were trying hard, but they were overwhelmed.    I no longer have any desire to ever go back."}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding reception. Food was served buffet style, which is perfectly acceptable in settings like Carrie Cerinos is set up. The food was above average. They had chicken marsla, rigatoni (which wasn't typical wedding rigatoni), mixed veggies and potatoes. Salad and bread before dinner. Setting was wonderful, the staff was prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Went there for Thanksgiving buffet and it smelled awful.  The service was horrible.  Our waitress spent more time running her mouth with patrons then serving food.  The ham and beef were okay but the turkey was bad.  They said they had three desert choices.  We all ordered the cheesecake then the waitress came back to tell us they didn't have cheesecake which left two choices.  We all ordered the pumpkin pie.  Huge mistake.  It was like baby crap none of us could eat it.  Each piece had a dab of whip cream the size of a milk dud on it.  My wife called to complain about how bad it was so they sent us a gift certificate for $25.  My wife and I just went tonight and again the service was terrible.  I ordered the Veal Parmigiana and it was nasty.  The breading was saturated in oil.  Never ever ever again."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but the current owners really should have sold it years ago. In case you haven't heard, they are totally DESTROYING the restaurant and bar in a very clueless \"update.\" It ruined our dinner last month when we heard the news. We talked to the owner and you could tell he had no clue at all about what he had -- one of the most atmospheric and historic restaurants in Cuyahoga County. If Cleveland still had a major newspaper, you would have food critics all over this -- basically, some of the dining rooms here and the bar have incredible historic atmosphere, we're talking 30 or 40 years old and unchanged, the kind of places that are landmarks in real cities like Chicago, LA, New York, Miami etc. But here in Cleveland too many owners don't get it -- the owner told us that he kept hearing how \"dated\" the place was. I said sorry, it's not \"dated,\" it's \"historic\" -- but as the OWNER, you should know this! You shouldn't have outside consultants to come in and tear apart your cool medieval dining room (with actual lit dioramas in the corners with armor!), and pull out the wrought iron and make it a \"winery\" room. What?! That's like taking a classic tiki bar and pulling out the vintage (and expensive) decor to give it a \"Jimmy Buffett\" update. How extraordinarily clueless. They're ruining the bar, too -- what was until recently a total throwback to the disco era (something just waiting to be capitalized on and made a trendy must-see CLE hangout) is about to be \"updated\" into something stupid as well. How sad."}
{"text":"Attended the New Year's Eve party @ $195.00 per couple. Understaffed, tables too close together u could not move, and food was not good.  Chicken Marsala very average and scrod not good. I don't eat red meat so not sure about prime rib. Vegs were mushy and desserts very average. DJ was good dance floor very crowded. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. It is a bit dated inside, very Italian, but the food has always been good for us. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. The Mama's pasta is my favorite! We do always get the same things however, I get the veal parmesan and my boyfriend gets the chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Crab stuffed mushrooms and chicken piccata wer really flavorful"}
{"text":"So disappointed. My husband ate here 20yrs ago and loved it. We've been talking and talking about going back and now we are sorry we did.   Food was mediocre at best. My husband couldn't wait to get the sauerkraut balls because he remembered them being so good, they weren't. His gnocchi was awful. The water tasted like it came out of a hose. The cheesecake was rubbery. On a bright note, the beer was good and so was the coffee.   Our water had very little personality. He acted like we were a bother. I'm sure he would rather have been laying home on the couch.   The decor is very old and so were most of the diners. I don't think they have tried some of the new good Italian places, they are just stuck in their old rut of eating here.   This is one and done for us. (Have gone once and won't return). My favorite part of this meal was leaving   Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"I am waffling between 2 and 3 stars because we were part of a large group and many people liked their meal.   First off, service was very good.  We had approximately 35 people and there were 2 servers who worked very hard.  All meals were served within 5 minutes of each other which is pretty special.  Drink orders were kept up with and servers were attentive to our needs.  My husband and I started off with the wedding soup which we both thought was very good.   Because we had a large group they gave us a limited menu.   I had the veal parmigiana and he had the chicken dish which was similar to chicken Romano.   One of our friends recommended the white spaghetti so we both got that as our side.   The chicken dish was very dry and had little flavor.   The veal was very tender, but I wasn't thrilled with the ham, tomato and little cheese on top.  There was barely any sauce, which is not veal parmigiana as I know it.   Neither of us was crazy about the white spaghetti.     The atmosphere is fine, with many rooms broken up, but we were on what would be the front porch of the building and found it comfortable.  I would likely not ever go back as there are too many other good restaurants to enjoy and this one wasn't worth it.   Maybe it's what I ordered, maybe it was our large group, I will never know."}
{"text":"This was easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  It was like this restaurant was stuck in the 1980's in terms of dining and decor.  I'm surprised to see that they actually have a website, I don't think they had those in the 80s.  But anyways, moving on to the food, huge portions of poorly thought out and poorly executed dishes.  I had the 'French Onion Soup' or more accurately, the overwhelming about of baked mozzarella that had some onion soup hiding under it.  The table then got a side of 'Sauerkraut Balls', these were conceptualized as a way to make something that's not so unhealthy (sauerkraut), unhealthy (fried sauerkraut).  The balls then came out with cocktail sauce....sauerkraut and cocktail sauce...  Moving on, I ordered an entree of the 'Grilled Filet of Salmon'.  An overcooked flavorless version of otherwise a relatively simple dish.  The rest of my family that unfortunately also had to suffer through the dining experience felt similarly about their dishes.  And then to top it off, the waitress gave attitude when no one wanted to-go boxes of the sad attempts of sustenance that was laying on our plates."}
{"text":"This place is good if you live nearby and don't want to cook at home.  Decent, homestyle meals.  Recentley noticed the portion control is in full gear with the salads which are not very large or appetizing and not even sure if they come with anymore.  The italian wedding and french onion soups are same old same old.  If you are really into mussels or veal parmesan then this is the place to go.  I got my pasta wi/olive oil and it was decent.  The menu choices are really not all that great, the best thing i like is their take home fresh baked cookies and pastries they sell in the hallway.  Pet peeve of mine:  not everyone can use their weird stairwell to get to the basement bar restrooms (i.e. older patrons, heart patients, handicapped, etc.) yet on the main floor dining hall all they have is literally one old school john.  We waited a huge amount of time to use it and who came out when the door opened?  An employee.  Really? They cannot build a separate restroom area for paying customers or put in a mini elevator if you want everyone to go down to the basement bar to use those restrooms.  The parking lot needs a little more lite as well.  As for the remake or remodel, personally I don't care one way or the other about that.  It is older, dated, dark mediteranean type place with a huge bright foyer-hallway which is a lot of dead-empty space that they could probably revamp into seating.  As long as it is clean and they do something about the awkward restroom situation, they can stay old school or new school.  The menu needs to be improved a little, can't rest on the past and home made pasta forever."}
{"text":"Carrir Cerino's was always a treat when I was young.  I still compare all other spaghetti and meatballs to Carrie's.  It was not until I was older and a little more adventurous that I tried the carbonera with the blue egg, just about did me in for any other pasta dishes.  I was spoiled enough to always ask for a Carrie Cerino's cake for every birthday . . . I wish I could get one sent to me in CA."}
{"text":"A good place to avoid, unless you are a fan of overpriced Chef Boyardee quality food.  Overly pretentious atmosphere and the owner is a total jerk."}
{"text":"Had my wedding here last night and the experience exceeded my expectations. The food was unbelievable, the pastries and cake were delicious. The venue was decorated so beautifully. The servers and bartenders took exceptional care of us. They accommodate for vegans and other food allergies. Couldn't of asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is like a time machine. Old world Italian cooking, Service that is efficient yet makes you feel like you are one of the family. Lots of \"regulars\" in the dining room. It's a casual, comfortable Italian Feast.  I had the eggplant, hearty and seasoned just right. My husband; good old spaghetti and meatballs. We started with a nice green salad and wedding soup. Both of us enjoyed our meals thoroughly, stuffed ourselves and still had some to take home. Desserts were out of this world. Cheesecake, chocolate cake. Serving sizes compared to the dinner entrees. You are NOT going to go home hungry from this place The hidden gem is the cocktail lounge area downstairs from the restaurant. The \"Under C's Lounge\". This place is like a time capsule. There was a full band playing Motown and dance tunes. Though it clearly caters to an older crowd, we had a blast. Average age of patrons was around 70 but don't let that fool you. This was like the place the cool kids go when they get older. Everyone was dressed up, wearing their Bling and dancing, drinking the night away. The band was amazing and the cocktails flowed smoothly our way. It was nice to have a restaurant cocktail lounge where there weren't kids sitting at the bar eating dinner!  Go check it out if only for the sake of nostalgia to the classy cocktail age.  Sorry, no pix,  I was too busy having a fabulous, good time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Carrie Cerino's.  The pasta is homemade and is always fresh and delicious.  The decor is not delightful, but we just laugh and proceed to eat the great food."}
{"text":"Very old school beautiful atmosphere!  Get the lobster ravioli or any of the signature dishes as you'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"High hopes were dashed. My wife and I joined a group of 30 friends who select an area restaurant every month for dinner. The restaurant is old and has the feel of a banquet style restaurant. There is a downstairs area that hosts entertainment, which looks interesting.  We were greeted by one of our two servers, who was very nice. Although we ordered from a limited menu, the variety was decent (pastas, steaks, fish, and traditional veal and chicken entries). The service was very good and the meals presented warm to hot.   I ordered the chicken Toscan and my wife ordered the veal parm. We both ordered Italian wedding soup as a starter and the white pasta as a side. The soup was excellent! However, both our entries and the side were average, at best. My chicken dish was a little dry and somewhat bland. My wife's veal parm was nothing special, but better than my dish. One of our friends ordered the scrod, which she said was over cooked.  With two glasses of wine each, our total bill was around $75, which was reasonable because the wine was only $7 per glass.  Although not a horrible experience, I would have to imagine that there are better options available in the area for Italian food."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  The ambiance of the place is perfect for a first date or a family night out. The service was fast and friendly.  Most importantly, the food was delicious!! I had the Parmesan encrusted talapia and it was phenomenal.  My father and I went there for to celebrate my exams being over and he loved it too. When the waitress found out she was sooo sweet and even gave us a celebration cake. It was such a sweet gesture!!  Then, after dinner we hung out at the lounge downstairs and just chilled. It was a perfect end to a perfect dinner."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had is incredible. My parents have been returning since my grandmother worked here in the 60's. Veal parmigiana tonight was at its best. Collectively we had the veal a la Costa, lasagna (simple but especially good), filet with mushroom sauce, and the bread. Lots of bread! Do NOT miss the pastries and cookies on the way out."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place and worth every penny. It is great for large groups or a quiet dinner. The food quality is great and consistent. The service is wonderful and always helpful with checking back on what we needed."}
{"text":"Old School is certainly the way to describe this place. We attended an afternoon wedding here and it was definitely an experience. First, the bar had been pulled from the wedding package. Bummer, but totally fine. We ordered drinks for our tables waitress, and the service could have been a bit quicker. We weren't going anywhere, but we waited long enough after the first round of drinks to know to order two drinks each the next time she came back.   The facility is separated into a few different rooms with moveable walls, depending on the size of each booked party. You walk in and down the hall to find your designated party room - there's no way you can get lost. They have bathroom facilities downstairs in what looks like a pretty dated staircase, but it really does just add to the uniqueness of the facility. Lots of funny photo opps with the way the walls are painted - definitely worth the trip downstairs!  The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. I'd say that they could have set up the banquet a lot differently so that people would be able to access it more easily, especially the cheese and crudités. Overall a strange experience, but we had fun nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Checked out Carrie Cerino's for the second time due to receiving a restaurant gift certificate. Got the meal to go and was very impressed.  To start they gave us 4 small loaves of bread of two different flavors - white and sundries tomato. Both were good, but we both definitely liked the white better so it was good we had our own mini loaves. Served with butter packets.  Salads were a great portion size with salami, chick peas, cheese, tomatoes on top.  I had the chicken piccata with risotto and thought it was excellent. The regular entree included 2 chicken breasts so I definitely have enough for another meal.  My hubby got the fish dinner with white pasta and both were very tasty as well.   Impressed with the food. Pretty standard Italian."}
{"text":"We stopped in recently for a reunion and had a quick bite to eat.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  I didn't have a full meal because we had to attend another gathering, but I did have time to taste some sauerkraut balls and pasta.  An order of sauerkraut balls, which is an appetizer, is big enough to be your dinner!  I think there were like 8 of them!  They were pretty tasty, but they did not knock my socks off.  I really didn't taste much sauerkraut in them, which is what I was hoping for.    I also tasted their scratch made pasta in white sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  It tasted like fluffy pillows of heaven!  Can't wait to go back and have a full meal!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Carrie Cerino's!! I have been to many different events here that are always fabulous, as well as stopping in for dinner every once in a while.  It's a great place whether you're going with a huge group of people, or by yourself...the food is phenomenal, the service is excellent, truly no complaints!  My favorite dish is the eggplant Parmesan!  It's enough for at least 2 meals!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner mid- January, with a party of 7. Despite being nice as can be, our waitress seemed somewhat scatterbrained... Having to be reminded about things when she would return to our table.  My hubby ordered the veal parm and thought the sauce that accompanied it was some of the best he tasted in a long time.  I ordered the chicken piccata which is usually one of my fav dishes when I go out.  This particular dish was a little disappointing.  They arranged 3 small pieces of chicken on a huge plate, covered it with a sauce that sorely lacked the classic lemon flavor, and threw on a couple capers.  My risotto, served on a different dish, tasted a little off... Can't place the reason.  Anyways, the chicken, although bland to look at, was tender although it wasn't what I considered piccata.  At least two others in our party were disappointed... (They suggested we come here because they recently attended a wedding reception and simply loved the food!  This dinner, for them, was a different story!). Gotta says, though, the dessert tray was a delight!"}
{"text":"Carrie Cerino's is a  real classic that never changes- which is a good thing!  They have stayed true to authentic, family recipes and while many other family restaurants are cutting corners, Carrie Cerino's never has. We've enjoyed the same quality and friendly service for years.  We dined recently for Grandma's 80th birthday. It was easy making the reservation for our party of 13 and they made us feel like we were really celebrating something special.  The table was set with delicious bread and I very much enjoyed my salad. I love the zesty Italian dressing and the little bites of salami. I ordered chicken piccata for dinner and received a generous portion of perfectly cooked chicken cutlet in a buttery, lemony, rich sauce. Love those salty capers! I ordered broccoli with mine (damn you, low carb) and it was cooked well. Everyone was very happy with their meal and our server was excellent. Drinks refilled, dirty dishes removed quickly and of course he obliged when we asked him to take a photo. I'm sure that is super annoying to a server, but he even took a second picture from the other end of the table.  Carrie Cerino's could use a bit of a facelift. You can tell that there hasn't been updates in some time. Make no mistake- there is nothing worn out or worn down about this establishment!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to be disappointed and waste your money STAY AWAY. Heavy salty tasting Italian food. Like the old grey mare, it ain't what she used to be. Suggest you go to Olive Garden if you have a taste for Italian, at least you know the food would be good and worth the money.   The place was pretty empty, should have been a sign.  Good bye forever Carrie Cerino's."}
{"text":"We didn't have high expectations with some of the Yelp reviews. Wow I was pleasantly surprised with every part of the visit. I started with the house salad it wasn't your normal lettuce with a tomato and croutons. It did have that but also, cheese, salami, chick peas, and cucumber. The ranch dressing I had was good. For an entree I had a special chicken diabolo. Chicken breast over marinara red sauce with capicol, mozzarella, tomato and hot peppers. The white spaghetti was fantastic both cheesey and buttery! Last but not least we came early and the food couldn't come out quicker, Good job."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner last evening and the service was outstanding.  Food is always good and have never left hungry."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in a long time! My family and I have been coming here for years! The staff is a little older and they have been working here forever. They always joke around with us and show that they love working there.the crowd here is usually an older bunch, but every once in a while there are younger people. The environment is much better than what it used to be. The whole restaurant was redone last year and it looks sooooo much better! Now onto the food. The wait staff brings baskets of bread throughout the whole meal and I have to say that the bread is addicting and you can really fill up on it! Sometimes my family orders garlic bread with cheese and it is always delicious. For my entree, I always, always, always get chicken Parmesan. The entree comes with a choice of soup or salad and pasta with your choice of sauce. I always get Italian wedding soup and spaghetti with red sauce. The Italian wedding soup is my favorite wedding soup out there. The chicken and the pasta are simply amazing. The portions are huge so you get to take it home for lunch the next day. I have never had a bad meal here and would recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant! I get the same time Everytime (chicken parmesan, duh) and it's amazing! The chicken is always tender. I always have leftovers after my boyfriend and I eat here because they give us bread, salad, and pasta with our meals. The interior is beautiful, the purplish decor in the dining room is gorgeous, and I love the chandelier! The staff is polite and very helpful."}
