{"text":"A small brunch spot.  Ordered the Smoked Trout Plate and Eggs Federal. The trout plate had a lot of trout and overall the meal was filling.   The poached eggs in the Eggs Federal were overdone but the rest of the dish was good.   Also got a house made root beer which was similar to a typical/common root beer but tastes more earthy.  We came at around 10am on a Tuesday (during the holidays) and we didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Damn. This might b my new favorite brunch joint on the west end. I stopped by last weekend and the place was buzzing at 11am. The tangerine juice was next level tasty. I didn't even know you could make tangerine juice.  The menu is small and focused with 3-4 sandwiches, sides, and 3-4 egg dishes. Also: waffles.  I had the cuban and it was very well made with fresh avocado and tender pulled pork. It comes with a spinach side salad and ROSTI. Damn, I love rosti. I also enjoyed the zucchini coconut curry soup...awesome flavor combo."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot! They have a nice selection of dishes and everything is good. The cubano sandwich is a fav. Also have to try their eggs federal. Nice friendly service too. Their homemade ginger pop is delicious! So is their watermelonade  I recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner due to it's proximity to The Lockhart (the Harry Potter inspired bar) and were not disappointed. We waited for a table for about 20-25 minutes at the bar, where I enjoyed a cocktail (can't locate a drink menu online but it was the last one on the list, I think it was peach something?). The bartender was super friendly and chatted with us while we waited. Didn't realize the rave reviews over the burgers at the time so I ordered chicken and waffles which was very tasty. Service was a little slow, but to our waitress' credit I'm pretty sure she was the only waitress for the whole place. While it does seem like more of a brunch place based on reviews, definitely don't count it out for dinner!"}
{"text":"OK, I'm, as of 3 reviews, a reserved and cautious (well, really quite critical) diner, but, man, I just love this place.  (No, I do not work there or have a stake in profits, in fact, I'm sometimes a bit bemused by the homogeny of the clientele, the way ppl drop by, everyone knows everyone, it's hang out central for harmless hipsters, the ones with not so many tattoos and don't look like they've been crashing on someone's couch the last 3 weeks.)  FOOD  Man, order whatever you want.  Get the homemade juice.  It's fine, simple, healthy fare.  Organic, restrained, quality.    SERVICE  These guys, always guys, never a gal (umm hiring practices??) are smart fellas, they lookatchya, figure you out, cautious, polite, trying to not f up, ya know, like they care, which they do maybe because they feel ownership or they're close friends with owners and they don't want to seem like douches in front of a clientele of a very tight-knit circle.  So no one wants to be pegged as the lone a-hole working at this place where lovely, nice hipsters congregate.  Peer pressure, see, it works.  Oh, um, the pear was a bit dry on the ploughman's platter.  (Ya see, a balanced review.)"}
{"text":"I love this place.   It's around the corner from my me.  I avoid the weekend rush and might show up every week day if I could.    I haven't tried a lot on the menu because I'm so madly in love with the cubano sandwich.  I has lots of pork, avocado and a pickle with a side of rosti and arugula salad.  With a beer, this is the perfect meal."}
{"text":"The Federal is an impressive place on dundas for brunch. The poached eggs were yummy and the portions were hearty. The service is really friendly and I would not mind trying it for dinner. The best part is that it feels very homely and warm - the decor, the food, the street, and the people."}
{"text":"Delicious food and attentive and efficient service. I had the smoked trout and scone, and it well-priced and portioned. As I visited on a Wednesday, the atmosphere was calm and comforting."}
{"text":"I have to agree with people on the bad service there! I have had brunch there once and the sandwich I had was good, but options are small and portions, too. Especially for a brunch place.   Today I went there, to inquire something about the menue and the waiter was so unfriendly! Unbelievable. Why do those people work in service? I dont understand.  Going to a restaurant should be a pleasent experience, but not with bad service like in the federal.  If you like tiny overpriced portions, unfriendly waiters and unnecessary waiting hours - thats the place for you!"}
{"text":"Busy location with great customer service. We arrived early and still had a short wait for a table. Coffee was good and the Eggs Federal were excellent. I'm an eggs benny fan and the mushroom tarragon cream was an excellent savoury option.   Tip: The seating is fairly tight due to being a small location, so would not be easy to accommodate a wheelchair. Just like may other Toronto brunch locations the washrooms are located in the basement."}
{"text":"They're usually super busy on the weekend for brunch, and for good reason. We waited for about 40 minutes because we were a big table of 6 people.   Amongst our group, we ordered the eggs federal, cubano, four guys burger, and smoked trout plate. The mushroom tarragon cream on the eggs federal is a welcome and refreshing substitute for the conventional hollandaise sauce on eggs benedict. The sandwiches were also well received by the table, overflowing with a very large variety of fresh ingredients.  Service is a bit slow at times, but overall acceptable. Be prepared for long wait times for everything, but it's well worth it (and the coffee is bottomless)!"}
{"text":"Was taken here a few months back by a friend and I have been converted to a believer !  I have since returned for brunch several times and dinner twice, and all times have been remarkable. Brunch is always great and everything I've tried has been amazing from the eggs, to the sandwiches (Cubano & curried chicken), the ploughman's lunch. The only bad thing is that it can be busy at brunch on the weekend. I try to go on week days to avoid the crowds. One time we arrived just as the kitchen was closing and they happily took our orders. Staff has always been super mellow and very friendly. Attentive but not annoying and no too cool hipster attitude. Kudos! Definitely will be back regularly for the food & yummy Caesars ."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was so terrible that it hardly made the delicious food and interesting decor worth it. Friendliness is free and would have made all the difference."}
{"text":"The curry chicken sandwich is to die for! I still talk about it and I went to The Federal about 6 months ago!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a terrific place to eat!  Their satisfying menu and friendly staff keep me coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Brunch review, I haven't been in the evening (dinner looks good though).  They have brunch every day! Delectable food and a solid variety of it - pretty sure anybody can find something they'll like. They have your standard egg breakfast, salads, sandwiches, waffles, french toast...seriously just about everything. Tiny place, so you're likely to wait during busy hours, but get there by 11a and you're likely good if it's a couple of people. Definitely a hipster joint, but not obnoxious, it's cozy and friendly, good service. Older folks may feel out of place. There are a couple of nooks by the entrance windows that are fun for street watching.  I usually get the cheesy eggs with sausage, which is not the typical link but a thick disk - and I'm obsessed with it, always save it til last. Think they have maple syrup in it, so good! Eggs and rosti are properly cooked, but could use more seasoning. That's filling enough, but I often go for the homemade scone with lemon cream and jam, because it comes warm and it's awesome. My GF is gluten and dairy intolerant, but loves this place for the trout plate and the same standard breakfast I get, but they will (sometimes) let her change the toast for avocado.  Good for: 2 people, tourists GF and dairy intolerant people can make it work, but it might not be your first choice."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.   Their vegan French onion soup is surprisingly very good for being vegan (as it's missing the authentic beef base).  The Cubano is unbelievably delicious. It is a little greasy though, but so full of flavours.  The Ploughman's lunch has a nice array of cheeses and meats (with some fruits to cleanse your pallet). I really though it would be more full though? It seemed kind of sparse.  Their mimosas are excellent.  However, their side salad (that comes with most meals) is very salty? I wish they had a different dressing. It gets quite busy in here so try to get their earlier.  The service is hit and miss, depending on who you have serving you. I guess they pool tips here though as they all check up on everyone else's table- which is nice.   Just FYI, they close their kitchen at 3 and open it back up at around 5... So no late day brunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come I try something new and it never disappoints. I love the homemade sausage patties, so delicious. The Cubano sand which is one of the best I've ever had. And the Cobb salad makes you forget you are eating a salad. So good. Worth the wait on the weekends. Read a previous review about the coffee being good and it's true, even the coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"Really good brunch place, the hash brown is soo good, highly recommended. Good service, nice decor and great food."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a birthday with a party of 8. We arrived at 8 pm and I was relatively empty - about two tables. I can't say enough good things about the food. It was really tasty, original and I liked everything a lot ! I had the gnudi pasta and the steak flank. My partner had the pork with this incredible Mac and cheese. Others at the table got the meat board which was delicious and had great variety. Veggie chili -also great !   With that said I have to say the service is just awful. We didn't get out until 11pm. This was mostly because  the servers were really inattentive and didn't even take our food orders until 845 -9 when it was starting to pick up again. We sat with empty drinks for over 20 minutes, and then the drink order itself took about 20 minutes. Once the dude took our drink order and then walked over to the table behind us and sat down for a chat !  Food took over an hour to arrive. But that was okay given we were all expecting a bit more time due to the size of the party. They were both nice and friendly but so often we would be looking over trying to catch their attention and they were talking to one another or lost in conversation with two chicks at the bar.   So a higher rating but the service was just so slow - but not unkind.   Also the bathrooms feel dungeony."}
{"text":"I visited today for eggs and coffee, and both were deliciously satisfactory. The watermelon lemonade on special was super tasty and I enjoyed my very cheesy scrambled eggs and cheddar. The sausage patty was a little gamey and over-sweet and the rosti was loose and more like grated hashbrowns, but otherwise my meal was yummy. My date had the veggie omelette special with spinach, squash and chevre which was very nicely put together. The hot sauce they provide is A-1! Gotta respect a place that has good hot sauce."}
{"text":"The Federal just opened on Thursday this week and when I went -- on Saturday for lunch -- they were already packed! Glad to see it's becoming a fast favourite in the neighbourhood.   They make their own homemade soda: cola and ginger-lemon flavoured. The latter is the one I had and I'm happy to report that it's both refreshing and delicious. I also had their Cubano sandwich which was stuffed with roast pork, ham, avocado, cheese, etc, and came with greens instead of fries -- a good complement. And it comes with a potato rosti. So tasty.  I've also had the cobb salad, which is both big and flavorful.   Plus, they take reservations! And once the liquor license comes through, they'll be doing excellent Caesars. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Dropped into this place since it was near to my new home and my initial impression was that it was a little bit dark, but cosy (great for winter and autumn evenings). I sat near the front and greeted by the SHYEST waitress I have ever met. Great expressos, cool and quirky thick wooden tables, and some level of quirkiness about the place. Ordered simple scrambled eggs with rosti and I thought \"Where's the rest of it\"? at first looking at the small plate. But this was more than compensated by the delicious freshness of the ingredients. No doubt made on the spot with love. Will I be back? Absolutely! Its like a hip home from home."}
{"text":"Great place for weekend brunch but busy. The space is small and stuffed with tables so in winter when everyone has a winter jacket it feels a little claustrophobic.  The food was delicious. We got the eggs federal and the four guys burger. Both items were very flavorful. The menu itself was well organized. I liked that the additional sides were available. And the sides that came with the meal were pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"Recently had my birthday dinner here. Eight of us had the shared family style dinner with Caesar salad and mushroom toast followed by the cabbage rolls and steak with mushrooms and kale. The food was amazing and they happily accommodated the vegan in the group! The wine was delicious, we had the SP68 (my new favourite wine) and the service was prompt and friendly. Definitely one of my favourite spots in the city!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were great. I ordered the day's special for brunch which was omlette with squash, sage and chevré, toast, gratin potatoes and some greens. I really liked the omlette, it was cooked just right but could use a little more flavour; perhaps it's own sauce? The other thing I didn't particularly enjoy was that they don't butter their toasts or give butter with the meal. Overall for the price ($12), it was a nice meal with a good portion size!"}
{"text":"Ideal brunch.  Had the Eggs Federal, a great eggs benny twist.  Add in a watermelon lemonade and a tea, and I didn't want the meal to end.  Great atmosphere, great bar, it will contiinue to be successful.  Drawback is the lineup."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can't say anything great about the federal. We were asked to sit at the window bench while we waited for a table. However, they never moved us over, leaving the four of us in the cramped corner.The food was bland, uninspired, over-priced and cheaply made. The cappachino and lattes were so bitter we had to send them back. And despite our positive and polite attitude toward the whole situation, the servers were unfriendly, at times rude and incredibly slow. No clue who would hype this place up. Bad through and through."}
{"text":"The Cubano is soooo good! I get it almost every time I'm in the area. The portions are quite large, well worth the money. It tends to be busy on the weekends so we try to go during the week. Must try!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood brunch spot! I was in Toronto for the weekend and decided to Yelp a brunch place within walking distance of our apartment and this happened to be the perfect place! We were a party of 6 and they were able to accommodate within a couple of minutes after we got there.   The service was really good and the food was delicious. I personally ordered the French toast foie gras and it just melted in my mouth. We had also ordered some other items on the menu and everyone left satisfied. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went for a few glasses of wine and shared edibles with a friend. Had the mushroom toast, ceviche, and beets.  The food was okay. I liked the company, the staff and the atmosphere better.  Next time I go, I must try the brunch and the watermelon G&T, but not at the same time."}
{"text":"Small and cozy vibes are strong at The Federal! If you don't mind listening to conversations left and right and cramped spaces, this place is worth a try.  I had The Federal bookmarked on Yelp forever, and the food was underwhelming. The Golden Standard tasted like a normal breakfast sandwich I could get anywhere and the potatoes on the side were cold and tasteless.   The Cubano was something we ordered afterwards and that is what I call a delicious sandwich! If I were to come again, I would definitely order it!   Also, I wish our server was a bit more friendly. She barely cracked a smile.. this place can do better."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here while in Toronto for a few days. She saw that this place and a few others had high stars so we chose this spot because they had the shortest wait time (15 minutes). The place is pretty small and compact meaning you will be in the face of strangers at the next table. On the flip side, if you're sitting next to cool people you can hold a conversation. The music was quite loud but not overbearing or hard on the ears. I ordered the vegetable omelet and a side of French toast. The omelet was nice and filled with sauteed onions,  tomatoes and a few other things. Potatoes (hash browns) and a green bed of salad accompanied the omelet. My omelet was tasty but not the best I've had. The French toast was pitiful to look at let alone taste. It was extremely thin and taste like an egg. I'm aware French toast is dipped in egg batter to coat it prior to cooking it,  but it should not taste like an egg. I was disappointed because I really had taste for French toast, just not their French toast. Overall, the ambiance of the place was nice and my server was friendly and on top of her job. I would recommend this place but you may want to stay away from the French toast."}
{"text":"I really thoroughly loved their Caesar. It came with each flavoured Doritos and little gherkins on a toothpick/mini skewer. The rim did not make me want to ditch the straw but the contents were delish. I chugged each one up to prevent melting ice to ruin the flavour. This drink will be all I return for though. My daughter was disappointed with their Federal Eggs (their interpretation of eggs Benny) and I was disappointed by their cobb salad and side of Rosti potatoes. The salad was bland and undressed or the dressing was super bland. The portion of greens to everything else left u with too much greens to enjoy it as a cobb salad should be enjoyed. The Rosti potatoes were saved by the delicious ketchup (made in house it seems) and awesome hit sauce. Will be back for drinks but bit worth the wait for brunch."}
{"text":"The waitress said people usually come back for the burger and she was right. In my view, it's perfect! She wasn't super knowledgeable about the wine and gave us the wrong bottle but what we got was delicious anyway.   All of us enjoyed our food and it's cozy."}
{"text":"Nice little spot on Dundas for drinks or food. Would definitely recommend the burger. Great value and one of the better burgers I have had in the city. Also had the corn on the cob which was good. Would recommend this place for a night quiet night for some good drinks and interesting food."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city. Food is outstanding, it's very small and loud but it's worth it.   Great vibe, awesome playlist, had an amazing Caesar. I also want to order everything off their menu. Literally every single dish. Will be back. Counting the days.   The foie piece on the french toast was the size of a cellphone and they do not skimp on portions. TThe standard sandwich is so flavourful my eyes rolled back and everything I tasted made me swoon. We shared three dishes and each one was just excellent.  Run don't walk."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast Friday morning back on Oct 7 2016 as my friend and I didn't wanna deal with the weekend lines to get in this place. Good place for a decent breakfast. I had the veg omelette and loved that I was able to sub the toast for cheddar scones - boy was I glad I did!! My friend went sweet and had the French toast with bacon. A pretty standard French toast is you ask me. Tasty but needed to come with more syrup."}
{"text":"Twas Thursday and we were in the mood for brunch.  Wife stumbled upon this not-so-secret gem. Food definitely hit the spot. The rosti (as opposed to home fries) takes this brunch game to the next level.  The smoked trout was really tasty and was complemented by a light lemon cream.  Definitely one of the highlights of the meal.  Along with some freshly brewed java, this has become one of our brunch faves."}
{"text":"I love the Federal. Their burgers are some of the best in town and are dressed like Big Macs with curly fries. Their brunch is also fantastic if you can get a table"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The food was bland at best, and the bottomless coffee was never replenished after one cup. Perhaps we made poor choices in ordering. We did only go this one time, so perhaps it is usually as good as the other reviews suggest. For us, though, there are many other places that we will try first, or which we already know are better, before returning to The Federal"}
{"text":"This food was excellent. I had the Eggs Federal and it was the so good. Everyone else loved their food. I also liked the vibe and decor of the place. If there is one issue, the space is a bit small. If you have a larger party, you might wait a bit to get seated."}
{"text":"Went to the Federal for brunch and had the waffles. They were incredible. Light with strawberries and blackberries and a really delicious lemon cream. Bottomless coffee and good atmosphere. Tables are fairly close together. Went around 1:30-2pm and didn't have to wait at all. Would absolutely recommend and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Today we came to Federal after many people telling us to try it out and that it's good. It was about a thirty min wait on Saturday and we got there about 1:30.     Federal seats about 30 people, it's cozy and warm. The decor is simple and with a small open kitchen and friendly staff.   So... the food. Well, I was really looking forward to a big and delicious breakfast today and Federal was pretty disappointing. I started with French Onion soup that was not the traditional. It was full of onions and flavor, a little on the sweet side and did not have any cheese on it. Instead they serve it with a side of tasty and flakey biscuit that I soaked in my soup. Only thing missing here is cheese for me. I think it's essential, however Federal has a super small kitchen with no oven or broiler.. so I can see why they can't melt cheese on the soup. But in my opinion if you can't make it right and complete, leave it off the menu.   Then we both had the Federal breakfast which is Federals take on eggs benny. It comes with a mushroom cream sauce and your choice of bacon or spinach. I got spinach and my bf got bacon. He like his enough to eat it. I wish I could say the same for myself. First off, the mushroom sauce tasted like gym socks. It had no base of flavor or consistency. It was just way too runny, it was more like soup. The sauce/soup soaked the english muffins so they were gross and soggy. I couldn't eat anything that the sauce/soup touched on my plate. And I like mushrooms and I like cream sauce so it's not that. I didn't send it back because I was so hungry I tried to eat around it and push the sauce off my eggs. And I maybe being too picky here now but I also didn't like the eggs. They were perfectly poached but it was the actual egg taste I didn't like. Like the eggs from whichever chicken on whatever farm it came from was shoddy. So, the English muffins were unsalvageable, the potatoes were okay and the salad was some leaves with a piece of pickled onion on it. My boyfriend said that the bacon version added a crispiness and saltiness to the dish which pulled it together for him.  Speaking of BACON! The place is small and the kitchen is right there (with the smallest hood vent I've ever seen) so if your in there while they are frying bacon you will also be swimming in a sea of bacon. At first I was okay in there, but once he started frying bacon it got hot and greasy in there so fast I almost needed to go out for fresh air. I like bacon but not that much. And if I was a vegetarian I'm sure I would have left or asked for my food to go at that point. And yes, we smelt like bacon when we left and our car and our jackets smells like bacon now. I would hate to walk through a dog park right now, I'm sure I would have all the dogs jumping on me.  I would give Ferderal one more chance and order a sandwich or something else. I heard the juices are great.  I would go there for lunch when it's not busy and they don't have twenty orders for bacon. Then maybe I would like it. As for eggs and Brunch.. I have a handful of other reliable spots."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! It gets really busy for brunch during weekends and rightly so. The wait may be discouraging, but honestly, it's worth it for the food. Once you get seated, the service is good despite the hustle and bustle which I always appreciate. The food is so dreamy; I really don't think it's just the hunger from the wait, but it's really good food.   With any popular brunch places, I would send 1 person a little bit earlier to put their name on the list (especially if you're a group of more than 2 people) and have the rest of the gang arrive half an hour later."}
{"text":"Brunch sounds good!  Dinner was good too. Very tasty, and that made up for a server who knew nothing about the menu and who added something to my meal without asking me first. I suspect that she can work her way through most things, but I think she needs to make a little more effort.  That said, we may have been in the right place at the wrong time. Clearly there's a popular brunch and I can imagine they would have the A crew on for that shift. It also seemed that as the night gets longer the crowd gets younger and hipper, so if we were 10-20 years younger and more focused on the vibe than the service, then it could have all been fine.   So maybe I'll give it another try for brunch, or when I hit my 20somethings in my next lifetime. Until then, I definitely recommend whoever is working in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This great little local restaurant has now graduated to a liquor licence and dinner service (they're still open for their now famous brunch). I have to disclose right off the bat that the guys that own/run this place went to my high school. I haven't been in touch since except through a mutual high school friend and we decided to try out their new dinner service.   The menu is some what limited, probably partially due to the size of the kitchen but also I'm guessing because they're new to dinner and trying to grow the menu slowly which is smart. The serving sizes are small and without sides so it's kind of like tapas which is good because you can try all the different yummy things on the menu. With our large group we basically got to try everything. The hits were the Mac & Cheese with Bacon was great - the pasta was very soft and cheesy and the bacon was super crisp and flavourful. The devils on horseback (date stuffed with almond wrapped in bacon over an almond paste) was amazing. The steamed boa was spot on and very flavourful and hit the spot perfectly. The things that could use some work is the new burger that they've just added. The burger was great but the cheese left something to be desired. It was just the usual processed cheddar slice, it would have be really elevated if it were served with a better more interesting and flavourful type of cheese (blue cheese, aged cheddar, brie anything). The only dessert option is a homemade chocolate bar. It was super yummy but very, very sweet so sharing one is all I think I could have handled. I think using dark bitter chocolate might have cut some the sweetness from the nugget. They could definitely work on adding more to the dessert menu, but the only option is a good one and thumbs up for being homemade in house and not just bringing in something from another bakery. Our groups main complaint with the menu is the limited vegetarian options (and no vegan options) or the need to modify (like Mac & Cheese with no bacon).   Overall this restaurant is doing a great job with their decor, style, food, service and menu. They're working through their growing pains (they now accept credit and debit cards) and now have a great wine and cocktails list thanks to the new liquor licence. You certainly won't be disappointed if you join them for dinner and drinks, but there is still room for this place to be perfection!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It kinda felt like walking into an old western movie going in, it's very old fashioned which is what I loved most about it. Old wood tables, and bar counter. Very friendly staff who were instantly welcoming and offering coffee refills on the reg. I loved how everyone there were helping each other it was really cool, the chef poured us coffee at times. The menu is limited but what they do they do very well. I have to give a shout out to their soup and sausage both were out of this world amazing. Both our breakys, coffee and my bfs soup came to about just north of 30 w tax incl. overall, it was  a great experience and we will return w/o a doubt."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????15?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The food was awful and the service left much to be desired. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Went there for brunch with a small group and everyone enjoyed their meals. I tried the Steak and Eggs. Get the Steak and Eggs. Retro-feel and classic dishes with a  modern, gastronomical twist. Perfect for breakfast, brunch and lunch...not sure about dinner. If going on a Sunday, get there early to write your name down...they do not take reservations over the phone. The brunch cocktails are also very good. I tried a Caesar and enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"This is a brunch spot I would gladly come back to, despite the slow service, noisy patrons and carrying around a je ne sais quoi smoked meat-type of scent with me the rest of the day.  Have I mentioned french toast & fois gras yet? I guess I could technically just end the review just here--but I won't.   I was bummed they had run out of the sweet scones so I got myself the side of potato rosti and the french toast as well, which was obviously a brilliant idea. The french toast & fois gras came topped with bacon, dates on a bed of decadent almond butter. The coffee refills were great. They also have an interesting selection of craft beers and ciders--why shouldn't every morning start with a ginger beer?"}
{"text":"I was initially nervous about checking out The Federal, after seeing reviews and pictures online - I was sure I would hate the hipster atmosphere. However, I was pleasantly surprised when we received amazing service, ample alcohol selections and incredibly delicious food.   We were a group of four and amongst us enjoyed the mushroom toast appetizer. We also had the oyster appetizer - however, it wasn't as well received as it had been sold to us - personally, I didn't mind it, but probably wouldn't order it again. I had the chicken and waffles and was in heaven! My boyfriend had the rainbow trout special and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our friends each had the flat-iron steak -their go-to meal at The Federal- and loved it."}
{"text":"I live a few houses away from the Federal, and have tried to give it my best shot, but after many visits here, I just cannot give it a good review. Coming for coffees or drinks should be no problem when it's not too busy, but sitting down for food can be a nightmare. They simply don't have the capacity to serve a proper meal - not enough staff, not enough people in the kitchen.   Most recently came for dessert and coffee with my boyfriend. We ordered cappuccino as well as the cheesecake and the ice cream sandwich. The cappuccino was cold when it arrived, and more than 30 minutes later, after having already finished our coffees, dessert hadn't arrived. We figured it could not take so long to slice a piece of cheesecake and serve up an ice cream sandwich, so we assumed that they had just forgotten about our order. Tried to flag down the waiter but he was not paying attention at all. So we went up to pay for the coffees and the waiter and the guy preparing the food actually started to complain to us that the dessert was almost ready and that we need to understand that a few orders had gone in before ours.   A simple apology would have been nice. I don't expect my dessert and coffee to come 30 minutes apart, and I don't expect to be the one receiving the complaint when I decide to leave.   If you're looking for food in the area, I would definitely recommend This End Up, just a couple doors west."}
{"text":"Great little spot, serving great breakfast and sandwiches. A beautiful spot to catch up with an old friend! Will definitely come back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend of a friend's birthday. I was really worried, since all the reviews talk about this as a brunch place, but it's also a pretty great bar.  It's a small, intimate place which means you're going to get pretty friendly with those around you. The drink prices are a bit on the higher end ($5 for a Molson Stock Ale, $7 for a tall boy of Magners cider) and their variety is limited, but good. After remembering that I hate Magners, I got a bottle of Beau's Lug and Tread and enjoyed that for the rest of the night ($9 for a very big bottle of beer. The kind you need to drink with a glass, lest people think you're drinking from a small bottle of wine.) Service at the bar is quick and friendly.  Since it was a birthday thing, the birthday boy's brother was DJing. Not sure if that was the usual for the place, but he was playing some really great old school R&B and pop (early 90s) which I enjoyed greatly.   Near the end of the night, about 10 of us made an impromptu dance floor out of the area in front of the bar. It was a great night and the clientele were also friendly and fun-loving. We'll likely be back."}
{"text":"It was ok ... Ambiance and energy was great... Food took way to long for a weekday...I thought my plate was suppose to have a mushroom cream sauce and instead had 2 pounds of mushrooms...and for poached eggs it was really 2 hard boiled eggs under 2 pounds of mushrooms... The best thing there was the Italian mimosa's !"}
{"text":"It was just okay. Music was prohibitively loud. I mean, I love the smashing pumpkins also but full blast at 11AM on a hangover Sunday is a bit much.   They also do that hideous hipster Toronto restaurant thing where they make you feel like crap if you arrive before your dining mate(s.) This has got to stop. I get that places are small, but I avoid so many trendy/rustic/hot spots because they refuse to be gracious and professional in the way they deal with seating people. And I know I'm not alone. I feel like any money they make turning tables quickly is lost when people feel slighted or simply don't go because of rigid seating situations.  Food was just okay, nothing to justify the extraordinary line-up outside. Just super, super average version of an eggs benny.  Sorry guys! The music totally ruins it."}
{"text":"The Federal feels like a neighborhood staple, like stopping by a friends place for dinner! Attentive and welcoming wait staff. The menu is comprised of comfy fan favorites with a fantastic flavorful twist! The brussel sprouts stole the show - a must try!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. We went here on a Saturday for brunch in the early afternoon. It's a small place and it was pretty packed when we got there, but we still got a table pretty quickly. Definitely a hipster vibe, but not pretentious. Don't recommend this place if you're in a rush, it took a little longer than most places to have our order taken, get our food, and then get the check. For us it was no big deal because we're here on a leisurely weekend trip, so I definitely didn't mind. And the food was well worth the wait.   I had a grapefruit mimosa which was good, but the star of the show was the vegetarian omelette. I thought I was just going to get a standard veggie omelette with green onions, tomatoes, etc. and some toast. Boy was I surprised! The omelette was full of delicious carmelized veggies. Mostly onions and zucchini, probably something else, but those were the most noticeable ingredients. Then there was a good helping of Feta in there too. The arugula salad with pickled red onions and hashbrowns were a pleasant surprise. I'm assuming the ketchup was house-made, it could have used a little more vinegar, but other than that, everything was fantastic.   Only docking a star because of the wait and the weird credit card machine we had to use. Maybe it's because I'm from Michigan or I'm just not that bright but it was something I've never seen before and I wasn't really sure what I was doing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Cubano Sandwich.  The smooth and ripe avocado really tied in all the flavours of the roast pork, ham, and cheddar all together.  It was a very flavourful and scrumptious sandwich that you eat with two hands (otherwise it was very easy to have the ingredients fall out).  It was incredibly tasty!  The greens were fresh and the potato rösti went well with the sandwich."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. I ordered gazpacho to start and it came completely blended (weird) with an unnecessary blob of goat cheese floating in it. Why? I ate 3 bites of it and the server didn't ask me if I was 'enjoying it' which to me comes off as poor form.   Followed up with the Federal Eggs BECAUSE of the Yelp reviews (I had them with kale instead of bacon) and I don't know why this dish comes so recommended. I guess if you had it with bacon, the sweetness of the dish matches, but with kale, there's no reason for them to put honey (or syrup of some sort) on the English muffins. It was totally off.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly. The arugula on the dish was coated in olive oil and completely decorative and flavorless. This dish was like 80% canned mushrooms and completely visually unappealing. Only have this if you LOVE sweet mushrooms? This should've tasted much more savory. The kale option really missed the mark, but I had a couple bites of my friend's dish who ordered the eggs with peppers and goat cheese, found it bland.   Best Caesar of my life, which is why this place gets 2 stars from me...also cos my friend footed the $60+ bill.   Toronto, you don't 'get' brunch. Go down to NY and take some lessons."}
{"text":"Labour Day is a difficult day to go out for brunch. A lot of places don't open. Or they don't serve their brunch menus, despite it being a long weekend. Thankfully, the Federal was both open and serving brunch!  Came for a birthday brunch with friends and we were not disappointed. We couldn't be seated until all of our party had arrived, which was slightly inconvenient for us, but makes perfect sense considering how tight it is inside and how busy this place gets! Once everyone arrived, we were basically seated right away (lucky us!) and we started to peruse the brunch menu.  To be honest, there isn't a lot of choices. It's a pretty concise menu. However, the dishes do inspire gastronomical desires. Between my friends and myself, we ordered the French toast and Foie Gras, Steak and Eggs, and the Eggs Federal. We all really enjoyed our meals and will be returning again. The dishes did not disappoint. I mean, I even eat my greens! And I really dislike when there's a bunch of green leaves taking up half my brunch plate!  The service was friendly, consistent and quick. The bathroom situation was interesting; it's down some fairly steep stairs and there are a couple singly stall washrooms at the end of the hall. It seems that they are too busy while open to check on the state the washrooms are in, because they weren't in the nicest conditions that day. Other than that, this place definitely deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on an early Sunday morning. This was a few weeks ago, and all I can remember is that it was good, but nothing extremely memorable. This teaches me to really keep up with my reviews.   I got the Eggs Federal with bacon and I liked it. But definitely hard to choose between that, and all the sandwiches, the Gold Standard and French Toast.   This is a great place for all day breakfast or lunch, if I have the choice, I usually go eggs anyway.   Service was friendly and no complaints. Would come again. Free parking on the street Sunday morning. It was a short wait for a table, as they will not seat until the entire party has arrived. At 10:30am, there was a few spots."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food is always excellent. Unfortunately, the Service is has always been terrible."}
{"text":"fantastic, the cubano was out of this world and the staff were super!"}
{"text":"Completely worth the wait. The food is very good, we ordered pancake and cubano sandwich ... amazing combination of ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is a very popular spot, so anticipate a wait to be seated. It's a cozy place with great service and great decor. We were seated at the bar by the window, which I loved because people watching while you wait for your food to come is always fun! Especially when cute doggies walk by!  I ordered the Eggs Federal and - as you've probably read from other reviews - they were on point! A take on eggs benedict, I opted to have mine traditionally rather than with kale and I ate every. single. bite. Even the greens! The dressing on the greens is light and when paired with the pickled onions, you can't help but to gobble them up.   We landed a table just in time to order drinks (you can't order before 11am) and I got the Italian Mimosa with tangerine juice. Wow!! I usually don't care for mimosas but was just wanting a \"hair of the dog\". I'm a fan! Everything was so tasty - I hope we are able to come back again someday."}
{"text":"Now I could throw a bunch of food verbage at you or tell you how I recently went on a culinary journey thorough time and space thanks to the Federal, but I will spare all that. Go eat here. Their brunch is on point. Cubano is a personal favorite and I know my Cuban! I have seen the Motorcycle Diaries twice, and own a Buena Vista social club record. ON CASSETTE! Fire down a couple dorito garnished caesers or house made Sasparilla and you're on your way to a tidy little Sunday.   Most recently popped in on a weeknight, not a Tuesday I think they're closed, and had the Roasted Cauliflower salad & the Burger. Both highly highly recommended. They have a small but well chosen beer selection and their Old-Fashioned rivals any on the street. Service is super friendly and attentive. Liked my experience so much I bought the tee shirt!   5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I was enticed by the steady 4-star yelp rating for the federal so I decided to check it out. They are very close and my true rating would be a 3.5 but there were a few setbacks. The menu is intriguing and they serve cocktails at brunch (finally, Toronto is catching on to the fact that people love a boozy brunch!) but the presentation was off: potato rosti is just a fancy word for what we already know as shredded hashed browns and the side salad had little flavor (probably no dressing). The omelet was tasty but it had tomatoes which were not listed as one of the ingredients (I don't like tomatoes in my omelet). My drink order was forgotten until the meal came but then it was on the house. Finally, the bathrooms. The toilet was clogged and the bathroom was not the most fresh or clean (maybe light a candle? get some air freshener?)  Bonus points for tasteful decor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Here in New York, there isn't a single breakfast sandwich that compares to \"The Gold Standard.\" And there's A LOT of breakfast sandwiches in NYC."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on Friday. We were greeted kindly. I ordered the Grilled cheese with bacon and my boyfriend ordered steak and eggs with a side of 3 egg whites. My Grilled cheese with bacon was a good size. The Bread was nice and crispy, the cheese was melted perfectly and the bacon was nicely portioned and was crisp perfectly. I also loved the pickled red onions in my sandwich, it gave it a really nice flavour. My boyfriend's Steak and eggs was equally delicious. His steak was cooked medium rare which was excellent, very tender and tasty and his sunnyside eggs and side of scrambled egg whites were really good. The place is kind of small but the atmosphere was pretty cool, very relaxing."}
{"text":"TLDR; Great neighbourhood spot for a tasty, reasonable dinner. Cosy restaurant, music is a little loud.   FOOD  We both had the burger & fries and a beer. So I can't comment in great detail about the menu. Burger was super tasty, ordered the fries animal style and they tasted identical to the ones from in-n-out burger. Good beer list.   AMBIENCE  Waiter was fine, nothing special about the service. Food came quickly. The kitchen is open so you can watch them make your food."}
{"text":"I'm still standing by the burger being one of the best in the city.  However I'm updating this review as I finally came for brunch to see what the hype is about. I'll admit that it's a louder, busier, and slower dining experience than stopping in for dinner, but that Curry Chicken sandwich is absolutely fantastic. Very unique but satisfying flavours, a definite wildcard as a breakfast item, but freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Service and wait time: 1/5  The wait time was standard for a brunch place on a Sunday; however, the staff wasn't accommodating nor had common sense on how to seat people. We'd have to explain to them if they sat x, y, and z that they'd have room for us. The speed of the service was mediocre, but having to repeat ourselves multiple times to multiple people was the annoying aspect.  Food: 2/5 We ordered the omelette, which was just ok. They actually ran out of the ingredients to fully make the dish. They let us know and gave us the option to order something else; however, we were already waiting for a long time so we stuck with our choice. They did knock off $2 from our bill to make up for the fact our meal was missing substance.   Overall thought: honestly everything was just meh. I don't understand the hype or long queue times based on our experience today. I won't be coming back since the wait and service doesn't warrant to a good deal either way."}
{"text":"Had the catch of the day (rainbow trout) with kale and a potato salad and my partner had the Four Guys Burger. Both were delicious. Service was attentive and friendly. Would highly recommend, esp. a great place to have a casual dinner date."}
{"text":"The wife and I had a late breakfast here - the reviews were raving about the Cubano and she's a big sandwich fan and avocado fan. The place was small, inviting in a pub/diner way. We were there before any crowd could form, so it was relatively quiet at the time.  Wife ordered the Cubano and found it delicious. I had the burger, and while it was not a hockey puck by any means, it was still closer to well done than medium. It was also soaked in sauce, mustardy stuff that was tasty but there was just too much of it.  Service was nice and the salad on the side was a nice palette pleaser next to the very well-prepared potato cake, which was crispy and tasty, if a little on the greasy side.  Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast, but Canada and burgers don't seem to agree with my American idea of a burger thus far. That's on me, of course. Will stick to sandwiches in the future. The Cubano looked good. Wish I'd had that!"}
{"text":"Pleasant spot. Comfort food. Came for Lunch (don't be in a hurry for your food though, cos it\s a chill, no rush place, fine with me..)  Relaxing, and looks like regulars here.    Enjoyed their cubano style sandwich on essentially plain white bread, nicely presented and tasty with the hash potatoes.  Will be back!   PS Enjoyed a glass of the Apricot beer ale. A nice finish to the lunch Sandwich"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch recently.  The daily vegetarian omelet was good; the house-made root beer was excellent; the french toast with foie gras, dates, almond butter, and maple syrup was awesome--both conceptually and in execution!"}
{"text":"You see people waiting out front but you gotta check if there is space. And luckily people are on their way out and the waitress is very kind and will let you know when the table is ready.  They have a great brunch menu and I usually go for breakfast foods for brunch but today, but this time I felt more like eating lunch foods.  We shared a curry chicken sandwich and a smoked trout salad. Both are fantastic and the fit the bill!  The service was attentive and nice, always refilling water at an appropriate pace. I think it'd be a good place to head back to.  The smoke trout salad had some great ingredients in it, worth eating multiple times."}
{"text":"The food is alright and service could be better, staff seems to have attitude. Had the Cubano and egg federal. Both looked delicious but I ended up getting a stomach ache after the meal. It was pretty bad, I'm definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a Saturday morning. There was a line up outside the door, but luckily we were the only table-for-2 in line, so we were seated immediately.  We ordered the Eggs Federal and the Cubano sandwich. The flavours were amazing. When we bit into the dishes, we were totally blown away and thy  definitely exceeded our expectations. The portions were generous and the definitely filling.  Plus the service was great. The waitresses were consistently coming by to refill coffee. We highly recommend the Federal. We will definitely be back to try the other dishes.  Though, I would recommend waking up early and arriving before 10:30 on the weekends if you do not want to line up."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food was just okay but I had to wait an hour to get in. It's pretty popular with a lot of people but I just didn't get it. The food was average at best and it's pricy for what you get.  It is packed a lot of the time though so it can't be all bad. It would be better if the server was friendly. I don't think I'll be back but I didn't hate it by any means."}
{"text":"Brunch of my dreams. The  special omelet was creative and came with a great salad and hash browns. Also tasted the sausage which was some of the best I've had. Flavored mimosas were really yummy. Not a ton of food but really tasty. Service was attentive but not super friendly. We were a group of 6 and took up almost half the seats but it didn't feel crowded."}
{"text":"Giving this a 4/5 and all I had here was a simple vodka soda.   So why all the stars? Because this place was the perfect setting for my beau and I to grab a drink on the tail end of our date. It has the coolest vibe, just super chill, but the interior is so interesting and ambient and kind of dark, thus romantic. I went here a little late when the bar was closing around 1 (due to some stipulation in place by the landlord) and the bartender was super nice, told us right away that they had to close early, but still brought our drinks over, served me my vodka with an extra lime (just the way I like it) and maintained the most chipper attitude even when late stragglers came in and missed the cut off.   They also have quite the selection of craft beer on tap, for those who are interested.  I didn't eat a single thing and don't even know what the menu is like, but I'll definitely be returning here for drinks. It's quite a wonderful little place hidden near dundas and gladstone. Take your girl here for some wine."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place on the weekend, the atmosphere is very nice and we had surprisingly quick and friendly service despite the place being packed. The food was very good, borderline extraordinary as well as tasting fresh and well presented."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to eat here for years and finally got a chance on a sunny Monday morning in June 2018. We got a cute table by the window.  My meal was good - had the Eggs Federal (their spin on a Benedict) without the English muffin. The mushroom tarragon sauce was good.  Service wasn't amazing, our waitress didn't seem happy or thrilled to be at work. I get it but kind of puts a damper on things. We asked hot sauce:sriracha and never got it. Oh well."}
{"text":"I'm writing a premature review here (for drinks only)...so it will be re-visited when I finally eat here.  I was quite taken by the COCKTAILS at The Federal.  Let's talk on-menu first...they're really doing a great job with both classic cocktails and more adventurous ones.  They make one of the best Old Fashioned's I've ever had and an absolutely delicious absinthe Sazerac, without pricing it in crazy-town because of the absinthe.   I was super impressed though by their willingness to work off-menu.  I asked about ingredients and discovered they were one of the very few Toronto bars capable of making a Vieux Carre, my favorite cocktail.  It's a bit tricky because it requires rye, cognac (or brandy), Benedictine (I'm too lazy for French accents right now), and a nice vermouth.  Well, they have the nicest of all vermouths...Carpano Antica, and a very delicious drink was born.  I was quite impressed that the bartender did a very nice job on his first time ever making this drink--his only error was serving in on rather small ice cubes....this drink should be served either neat or on very large rock, but I'll forgive him.  The SERVICE was super friendly.  We really liked our waitress who had just the right mix of attention and leaving us to be.    The VIBE was pretty cool.  I would describe this place as cozy.  it's dimly lit with clusters of Edison bulbs in a smaller intimate environment.  The trip to the washroom feels like a quest as it's a ways down a hallways downstairs.  I'm giving this place a very high 4 stars...I don't give 5 stars out often, so I don't think it's fair to do that without a repeat visit to try the food.  Their cocktails though are well worth a stop!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place for brunch, but the wait is long! Service was a bit slow, but the staff are really friendly, and the food was good. The eggs benedict were not runny at all, which was disappointing, but the it tasted good and made up for it."}
{"text":"Regular spot for breakfast. We always order the breakfast sandwich or the eggs Benedict. Simply amaZing, and they open everyday for 9 am"}
{"text":"We came here for Saturday morning brunch, and really enjoyed it! Granted, the place doesn't have much seating (it seats around 25 people, ish). And by the time we arrived at 9:30 AM, there was only one table for two left. So if you're coming here for breakfast/brunch and you don't want to wait, come earlier than later.   First, parking. There's paid street parking right in front of the restaurant along Dundas (I can't recall how much it was per hour - it may have been $1.50, but not too sure).  Second, the atmosphere. Think rustic, British pub meets homey, relaxing environment. We loved it. Simple, clean, and charming. It's a great setting for a relaxing morning, or even for an intimate evening. We enjoyed the ambiance.  Third, the food. We ordered the Eggs Federal (poached eggs with mushroom terragon cream) and the Gold Standard Sandwich. The Eggs Federal was delicious, a great texture, and a unique take to a basic brunch item. The Gold Standard Sandwich looks like a pretty basic breakfast sandwich, but it didn't taste that way - very flavourful and satisfying. We also had their coffee, which is sourced from Reunion Island Coffee down the street - strong, bold, and delicious. Overall, a great meal. Service for us was also super quick and friendly.   For everything, with tax and tip, we paid $40.00. We enjoyed our experience here, would definitely come back, and it was a great way to start off our Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I've been to The Federal a few times now, but the other night was the first time I ate an entire meal there.  We decided to share three items: the Moroccan Pancake, the Hot Fried Chicken, and a vegetarian dish with eggplant.  (As a side note, the menu on the website is hopelessly out of date so I'm attempting to go by memory. Is it that hard to update your site, guys?)  The Moroccan Pancake is essentially a pancake that's been piled with some kind of beef stew type dish. The meat is extremely tender and tasty, and the sauce is rich and delicious. This is seriously one of my favorite things to eat in the city.  I'm not generally a fan of fried chicken but I really enjoyed the Hot Fried Chicken. The breading is surprisingly spicy and the accompanying sauce provides a little tang. It's a tasty dish.  And that vegetarian thing was also quite delicious, though I can't for the life of me remember what was in it. I will say, however, that there were a few hard, inedible pieces of eggplant in there, which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Foie gras was uninspiring and served with a few slices of brioche, apples and mango chutney.  Very disappointing.  My daughter's Mac & Cheese was delicious and both our cocktails were good - the Blackcurrant Pisco Sour was delish.  The Eaton Mess dessert was tasty but hard to eat in a glass and there was very little meringue."}
{"text":"Went in for coffee, stayed for a meal! What A phenomenal experience! The food was delicious! The service was right on top too, but not too much either... It was perfect! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The ambience is great, and the best part is that I didnt have to wait 2 hours to get a table as you would with any decent place these days.  The food was amazing. I had mussels and curly fries while my friend tried out the pork special. The sauce for the mussels had the perfect balance between creaminess and freshness. The bowl was huge for $12. I also loved their house-made drinks - but sometimes I just want a regular coke (they dont carry any other soft drinks).  The service was the best part. Although the food took longer than it should to arrive (they have a very small kitchen), the waitress was a delight. She was funny, cute, and always checking on us.  A little portugal gem!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time I was impressed. I went yesterday and had the Cubano sandwich. The pork was very nicely done, and the flavours went together very well. Whatever pickle they put on the sandwich was surprisingly good, and really made the taste of the sandwich stand out. The sandwich was a good size, and I was pretty full at the end of it. The potato hash that they served with it was pretty good, although it was a little salty. I still ate all of it though!  The coffee was great as well which caused me to have 3 cups of it (my apartment got cleaned pretty quick after that lunch: thank you caffeine kick!)  I also have to commend the service. The woman serving us was friendly, smiley and attentive.   Nothing but good things to say about this place.  Oh, and if you are ever there for brunch, try The Eggs Federal: you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great and cozy breakfast place. Eggs Federal are spot on, different take on benny, but done well and tasty.  Love the decor and attention to details. Friendly service, was served by person that prepared my food.  Coffee is mighty, will wake you up for sure."}
{"text":"Oh, I love brunch.  There is just something wonderful about the coming together of coffee and breakfast with friends, a reasonable social hour and various cocktail-ey concoctions (sidenote: if you have not seen \"My Drunk Kitchen\"'s Brunch episode, I suggest watching it immediately.  I'll wait).   I've been to The Federal for brunch a few times now.  It's cozy and always warm, evoking for me that best-friend's-kitchen vibe.  I adore the granola and scones, not to mention their coffee.  Their service is somewhat non-consistent, which is seemingly the only drawback: at times a little distant (not rude, just...not interested), and at others friendly and joking, making me wonder if I should invite them to join us."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. 30 minute wait for a table and another 40 for the food to arrive. Food was good and the servers were nice, but not worth the long wait. music is fairly loud."}
{"text":"Super tasty but there's a male server there who's pretty rude and just sucks. Any other time I've gone and it was just the hardworking ladies, it was amazing! They're so attentive, but there's one tall dude that just ruins it every time I go (throwing menus on the table, ignoring you, brushes you off rudely, takes his sweet time clearing tables when there's huge lineups at the door)."}
{"text":"Way too much hype for this place. I love brunch and love supporting Toronto based restaurants but this was just bad.  And my clothes reeked of the food after... sad"}
{"text":"I love a good brunch and a good brunch spot near my house - even better! A daunting line met us at the door but magically the nice man taking names first said 40 mins but came back 2 mins later to say he had a table in 5 mins!  A welcoming warm wood and exposed brick decor makes you feel at home at once. The menu isn't huge but a good menu shouldn't be in my opinion! I dined with 3 of my best girlfriends and we had an eclectic sampling of the menu - all to rave reviews. I uploaded pics from all of our selections.   K went for the Cubano - shaved roasted pork sandwich and she loved it.  CF went for the smoked trout sandwich which she thought was delicious.  CB went for the traditional scrambled eggs and raved about the potato rosti - which we all gushed about as well as the salad which was simple with pickled onions pairing nicely with the vinagrette.  I went for \"The Federal\" two poached eggs with mushroom tarragon cream sauce over arugula - delicious!!!! I prefer that mushroom sauce to a rich Hollandiase sauce any day! There's a meat version of that dish too.  Other notables, the coffee was good. The servers very nice, attentive and easy on the eyes. They have a cheese/charcuterie plate that can come with a veggie friendly option and the waffle/french toast looked amazing on our neighbour's table.   I look forward to so many more experiences here. Awaiting their liquor license as anxiously as they are, I can't wait to see what they will offer for dinner fare. Sitting next to the new Midfield bar...I may have a new favourite corner on Dundas!  Tip - they aren't set up for plastic yet (debit or credit) but there's a bank machine right across the street until they get their machines."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. The flavors were fused together perfectly. I had the curry chicken sandwich, probably one of the most unique and appetizing sandwiches I've had to date."}
{"text":"Dinner Review: I came here for dinner with a friend (recommend making reservations if you're during peak times). The restaurant is a bit more cozy and the vibe is more chill at night escpecially with dim lights.  Food: I ordered a Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich and a side of French Onion Soup. Both were delicious. I do recommend ordering a starter if you're pairing it with a sandwich as I found the sandwich was not overly big (only $12 w/ salad).   Overall, a great place to hang out and grab a bite on the west side!"}
{"text":"First time Canada... first time Toronto. My bestie walked me through the city and made me mouthwater by the thought of this amazing Cubano sandwich on Dundas......  Closed!!! On a Thursday? !?!?! So we decided to walk three shops further and stumbled upon The Federal!! Amazing inside interior... eclectic describes best what was inside. The menu simple but with a Cubano!!   The experience was amazing!!! The food was more balanced than where we were supposed to go. Perfect symphony of avocado for the creamy texture, the pulled pork, the cheese melting away like a candle in a vulcano, the pickles just right for a touch of sour.  We matched it with an amazing White Pop. Ginger, lime and soda water!!! The staff was very accommodating and the price was perfect.......   If this is the bar set for the rest of my Toronto experience?!?!?!?! Hell yeah, I move here!!!!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at The Federal.  Gord had Mac & Cheese with bacon.  He liked it and said he'd get it again.  I tried a couple forkfuls and it was good.  I had a burger (minus cheese, lettuce and onions) and fries.  The patty is made in-house and was tender and tasty.  The bun was soft, which I like.  The fries were fun.  I'd get it again.  Our servers were quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. It's a small and charming restaurant on Dundas west. The bottomless coffee is amazing. I usually have the burger here. It's terrific. The other options are great too. The French bread and the poached eggs are nice. Overall a great place and excellent value for money. Great service complements all of the rest."}
{"text":"I came I'm for quick bite but found it pretty disappointing. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and I felt it was really slopped together. The slow roasted pork was almost none existent, and the avocado was a oversized chunk in the middle of the sandwich. The salad dressing had no taste. The cook had a shirt on that looked like it came out of the hamper and no apron on. That's too unsanitary for me to handle. On a positive note the produce, the bread, and the meat were good quality. This would be closer to a 2.5 star"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and ordered the eggs federal. My bf and I ordered the same thing simply because it seemed very good. Unfortunately the server heard only one order so my order came a little later. But handled it very well and complimented my brunch! Although she did not need to do that - you can already sense they really care about their customers dining experience.  The eggs federal was amazingly good - not too much sauce which is another plus and also had plenty of mushrooms it also had bacon, poached eggs and English muffin as the bedding which was soft and toasted lightly. The side potato rosti was also fried perfectly that it was crispy but soft in the middle.   We visited on a very busy day (Saturday) and waited a little longer since the restaurant is tight and small. But overall this place was great!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York and visited Toronto for a weekend. So glad I stumbled across The Federal. All of my friends who went with me agree that this is one of the best brunch places we've ever had. I'm so sad that I can't come here everyday :(   I had the scrambled cheesy eggs with both the avocado and sausage (only $1 extra!). The sausage tasted different, yet nonetheless good. It was more on the sweet side. My friends had the four guys burger and the eggs federal. Both of them really liked their food as well. Each dish came with a side of home fries and a salad. The home fries is hands down the best. Oh and definitely ask for the ketchup. Pretty sure it's homemade and it's delicious. I swear I could just eat that by itself!"}
{"text":"The Federal, I have given you two chances and, sadly, I will not be back.   I have only been here for brunch and there was about a 15 minute wait each time, but we were happy to wait outside or walk around for a little bit because it's in a cool area. The food was great the first time - we ordered the Steak & Eggs and the Eggs Federal and both dishes were fantastic. My boyfriend and I both ordered Caesars, but were hard pressed to find any alcohol in them.   On our most recent trip, I ordered the Smoked Trout Plate and my boyfriend got the Eggs Federal. Eggs Federal, consistently good, no complaints. Now let's get to the Smoked Trout Plate. Look, I'm not a stickler for presentation, but my order looked like the chef had thrown the food on my plate from the roof. Everything was all over the place and the poached egg that came with it was so sad looking that I had to eat it first just to put it out of its misery. My boyfriend ordered a Hibiscus Shandy which he liked and I gave the Caesar another try and still could not locate any of the vodka I know I had ordered.   And now let's get to the reason I will never come back here. The service.  The service is just so, so, so bad. The first time we came here we had a male waiter who never checked in with us and then disappeared for 12 minutes (yes, I was so annoyed that I actually started timing him). We wanted to order another round of drinks, but everything took so long that we didn't want to even bother. On our second trip it was the same story. Everyone/everything took so long. I had my iPhone timer at the ready (you guys, I know I seem like some deranged gym teacher, but I just don't think keeping someone waiting like this is acceptable) and it took, get this, 16 minutes before someone came to take our order. The women sitting next to us ordered well before us and their food came out almost 10 minutes after ours. The other couple situated to our left had been waiting so long for their food to arrive that they just asked the waitress for everything to go because I guess they had other things to do that day and couldn't sit at The Federal for nearly two hours like we did (I'm just not sure if the concept of \"turnover\" has reached the nice folks at The Federal).   I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a jerk from New York and I'm used to restaurants wanting to get me in and out, but I just find this service and the waiting to be completely unacceptable. The staff is either completely oblivious or they just must not care. Look, I gave it two shots (the two shots that I wished they had put in my Caesar), but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"2.8 Stars (it's my Yelp and I'll 2.8 if I want to).  If you want inspiration on good lighting, this is your place. We hip hip hippity hopped to this hipster haven (how's that for alliteration?).   VIBE Simple but effective decor. You've got the mason jar lighting and the starred lighting in the front window. I love the stars along the wall. I also love the little alcove near the front window and the bar. Who ever gets to sit at the bar at a brekkie joint? The guys here are really nice and service effective and on its game. It does feel like you're going to a friend's place for a good breakfast and a hang out. Oh, and there's a cool little poker room in the back that has a round table that seats about 8 people. The flower paintings look like they were hand picked from the Salvation Army but that's the appeal.   WE ATE  Firstly, big up props on the tangerine juice. Mmmm. Better than Kool Aid. OH YEAH.   We had the Ploughman's lunch, rosti and Federal Benny (their version of egg's benny). I felt the food missed the mark. On the ploughman's was the rabbit terrine (not something you have everyday) and though it was nice, it's not something I used to and wasn't hearty enough. I didn't eat the pickled jelly or the cauliflower pickled stuff. Oh, and there's more pickles --dill and I asked for extra dill, which they very nicely gave. There was supposed to be blue cheese and there wasn't (I didn't need to know!) but then they found some and gave me white cheddar on top of it. The bread they get locally sourced across the street (and from Joe's for their sandwiches) was delicious. And yes, the rosti is yum. I would suggest sour cream to go with it (that's my Movenpick tendencies kicking in).   I had a taste of the Federal Benny and dining companion wasn't impressed. It's not that it lacked flavour --it was just off in terms of taste. I'm a hollandaise gal and to not have hollandaise on a classic is a no no for me. I can't describe this. (Which is how much I love hollandaise).   This was my first time here but I'd come back and see if the sandwiches would change my mind because they looked pretty tasty. The Cobb salad also looked tasty (albeit deconstructed).    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I like that this place is motivating people to get down to the Dufferin/Dundas area and love the gentrification happening here but the food has to be good and it was meh. I think this would be a cool place to have a dance party though (with tangerine juice)."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in Toronto. Super cozy, simple GREAT food, delicious cocktails, wonderful service."}
{"text":"Ordered a half order of waffles which were too small. Definitely could have gone for a full portion possibly and additional food. The Lemon sauce was a delicious addition to the syrup."}
{"text":"This is probably our favourite brunch spot in the city, and for good reason. Every single visit has been delightful, and between the food and the fast and friendly service I don't see that changing.   My boyfriend introduced me to this place. He usually gets the Cubano sandwich, which is always done to perfection with a nice side of greens and melt-in-your-mouth potato rosti. I have a food sensitivity to avocado and when I requested it to be swapped out they were more than accommodating and even gave my portion to my boyfriend on a side plate so he could have extra.   Their burger is also fantastic, always cooked to perfection and never skimping on toppings. I recommend asking them to add a fried runny egg to it, it really makes a nice change.    Every time we've visited there's been a line, but the servers have it down to a science and rarely is the wait more than we can or want to handle. Even on New Year's Day they arranged a fixed menu brunch so that you still felt satisfied but weren't waiting long.   Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Great service, food and prices! My boyfriend had the fried chicken (delicious) and I had the four cheese mac and cheese. So good! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great brunch place with awesome coffee!   I don't always find the coffee at brunch to be of any quality or worth mentioning however, the coffee served at The Federal deserves two thumbs up.  I got the scoop for all you coffee lovers, it's Reunion Island coffee!  I did a quick search and you can get their beans from their shop in Roncesville or online.   Now the food, we ordered the Golden star sandwich and the federal egg Benny. It was delicious!  I particularly like that all meals are served with a side of fresh arugula salad and rosti. You also have a choice of substituting bacon for kale if you are health conscious.    The service was great, my coffee was refilled promptly and trust me, you can't just have one cup.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I made the decision to check out The Federal because I like mushrooms. Simple as that. Also, I am a big fan of Eggs Benedicts. When I read in a review that The Federal offers an Eggs Benedict with a mushroom sauce on their menu, I had to try it. Regina and I arranged to meet here for brunch on a weekday, and I almost walked past the restaurant. It is a tiny but cozy space. Regina was already here when I arrived, and we were the only 2 people in the place. As soon as I sat down, I began to look around and took some pictures. The guy at the counter did not seem happy with this. First thought, the attitude better not continue during our brunch. If it does, the food better be pretty damn spectacular to overshadow this bratty attitude.  Started out with coffee. Free refills, so that was a good start. I loved the seating. Seemed like a great place to hang out with a coffee and book. I would not however, because even though the seating was great, the vibe was not. I did not feel relaxed or welcomed here.  Regina ordered the Smoked Trout which came with a lemon cream, capers, cucumber with a savory scone, greens and potato rosti, $12. Regina really enjoyed this. This is where Regina's taste and mine differ. I found the potato rosti bland, I am not a fan of onions and I felt that almost every component on this dish had an element of onion in it (onion dressing on the salad, onion relish, green onions in the scone, chives on the trout), and I did not expect the trout to be cold. Even the cream was lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle salt on it to get flavor out of it. Separately there were some good parts to this dish, but together all I could taste was onion.  I ordered the Eggs Federal, which consisted of poached eggs on English muffins with mushroom tarragon cream and bacon (or spinach) with greens and potato rosti, $11. I wish I had loved this. I really wanted to love this. But the sauce did not have the necessary kick to survive the overzealous hand that sprinkled the chives. You could not taste the tarragon, or the mushrooms for that matter. Maybe if the mushroom pieces had been larger, and the chives were omitted and tarragon was sprinkled over the sauce instead. There was definitely potential since the bacon was nice and crispy, and the eggs were perfectly poached. Close, but not quite there.  The whole experience felt like we were in fact in a new restaurant trying to find itself. So many things were working for it (i.e., the seating, location, menu), yet the execution was still a work in progress. When you eat a dish and you think to yourself, \"this part tastes good, this part is not necessary, this alone would make a good dish....\" Really, all elements on a dish should compliment each other rather than detract from one another. But then that is my opinion. I was disappointed, and Regina seemed quite pleased with her meal. Opposites attract I guess.  I would not return.  Oh yeah, CASH ONLY! How annoying."}
{"text":"The Federal is such a nice little getaway from my same old homemade omelet daily routine on quiet weekdays. Their food tastes like home cooking, but never without an inspired twist. Their service is quick and friendly. The decor is simple, but not boring.  Some of my favourite menu items are their very flavourful Cobb salad, not-too salty smoked trout, delicately made to order waffles with lemon cream, and pulpy watermelon lemonade. Their gazpacho reminds me that I still make some things better (and really shouldn't be spending money eating out as often as I do), but their low prices make it easy on the wallet and their high quality even easier on the pallet."}
{"text":"I walked into The Federal this morning with no expectations. The menu was short and sweet and the place was warm and cozy. I started with a half serving of waffles (perfect when craving salty, but still can't resist a bit of sweet): it was the absolute best waffle dish I've had in Toronto. The waffle is served with lemon cream (sent from heaven) and just the perfect combination of moist and fluffy. I then ordered the eggs federal: the eggs were perfectly runny and the mushroom cream complimented the dish well. My boyfriend ordered the gold standard sandwich which was also delicious. The greens and potato rosti that came with both dishes blended and enhanced the flavoring so nicely. Most importantly, the coffee was spot on. Overall, definitely one of the best spots for brunch in the city!"}
{"text":"The Federal locked up my hunger and threw away the keys, had a great brunch here with my friends. I ordered the 4 guys burger and it was very good, the meat was cooked to perfection and the bun was soft as the clouds they fell from. Had a caesar that tasted very good, when a good caesar crosses your path you stop that caesar and you drink it down. Cause not too many places make them as good as these, very surprised. The side salad was fresh and the home fries were cook through perfect. Aside from our mom jean wearing waitress getting my order wrong and bringing me someones salmon (it happens no worries), everything was amazing and I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Frederal review:   The Frederal always manages to sneak its way onto a number of different lists and articles so I had to give it a try. This place is always bustling during brunch hours, so try to go a little bit later (or earlier) to reduce your wait times. The menu is very simple, and the service is quick and friendly.   We went for brunch and ordered the homemade root beer and white pop for drinks, and the cubano sandwich and scrambled eggs for food. There is a bit of a wait for food so make yourself comfortable.   Root beer is great, but a little too root-y for myself. White pop lemonade is tasty and full of citrus zest.   The cubano sandwich is surprisingly filling and there's a lot going on in the sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the avocado mixed in. It comes with some greens and potato pancakes on the side.   Great food, atmosphere was nice, and not overly expensive. Will be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The Federal is a super popular brunch spot on Dundas West and I can see why.  Hipster cool and unpretentious place serving solid dishes at reasonable prices.  We arrived at 9:20 am and snagged the last open 2 top and saw many people waiting for the next hour.    Though the place is on the right side of the street to get the sun into the windows, it's a bit dark & rustic and the vibe is chill, hipster-lite, and welcoming.  Service here is really nice and sweet.  Attentive to the point you dont have to ask for a coffee refill.  The restaurant isnt super big so coming here with a group bigger than 4 might be a challenge especially if you come later in the morning.  Omelette of the day ... squash, kale & chevre - Solid dish that is quite tasty.  It is perfectly cooked so its not rubbery or overdone.  Soft egg covering a healthy amount of sweet soft squash with bits of nice green kale and a tangy molten chevre.  The crispy rosti is also well done.  I want to give this a 4 star rating but nothing jumped out to me as being 'oh wow, gonna order this again' 4 star rating.  I'll still say it is definitely above average than other restaurants.  3.5/5  French Toast with fois gras - To me, I know this dish as the Commander Hadfield brunch.  Supposedly he ordered this over the top decadence ... a hearty amount of french toast with a buttery fois gras on top.  Similar to the omelette, it is well done... the french toast wasn't dry and it was good.  The fois gras didn't make or break the dish either.  I can't fault the dish for anything except nothing said 'oh wow, this is really really good'  for a 4 star.  3.5/5  Overall, great brunch spot on Dundas West.  I can see why its popular.. friendly and warm service that serves good solid dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot, like, every month for a year a lot. The food is delicious, coffee is ok, but the service had gotten worse & worse so sadly I've stopped going. They won't seat you until your whole party has arrived now, and ask you to wait outside (in -11°) until the remainder of your party gets there. We also tipped 15% for mediocre service and we're curtly asked \"is that all you're tipping?\". Um yes, and now if I can have it back please because I fancy tipping 0% right now. Sad, as I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Food might be good but we were completely ignored by the staff. If you can't bother to acknowledge my presence after standing around for 10 minutes I'll find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Brunch is a disgusting cultural fetish and I hate people who go to brunch, and I also love brunch. So I usually hate the people in the restaurant, resent the decor, nitpick about the food, and go home in a epidermal stew of self-loathing.  However.  The Federal brunch is so good I didn't hate myself or anyone/thing even a little. Smoked trout and eggs benedict shared - hooray! I love my friends I love hollandaise sauce let's just *drink caesars and gab*."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Best veggie omelette I've ever had. Hands down!! The way the goat cheese just explodes in your mouth every time you take a bite was by far the best part of the whole meal. The toast and hash browns were also quite yummy, but I'm all about my protein intake! Side note, I'm in Toronto quite often and every time I stay in the area, the restaurants never fail to disappoint me. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Federal is a classy bar/breakfast spot east of Dundas and Dufferin. The vibe is super cool, hipster but chill, not pretentious at all, a relaxed atmosphere. The drinks were spot on and service was prompt. It's great for groups of 2-4, maybe 6 if you get the big table. The kitchen is open concept.   Although we didn't eat here, the food smelled deliciously good. It's mainly 20's and 30's that come here. They have a lengthy selection of handcrafted cocktails, usually running about $12-15 each. Will be back to try the food.  Pro tip: Excellent for a date night."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood spot. I've had their grilled cheese, their fish specials, salads -- everything I've had has been solid. Even their wine and beer list is quality at the right price point. I haven't been to their very popular brunch yet, but dinner is always good."}
{"text":"First brunch place I tried out in Toronto! This place is small but the food and drinks are great. Definitely will recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"The Federal is my go-to local brunch spot, and I feel lucky to be able to roll out of bed on a Saturday and walk a mere 5 mins to this destination of deliciousness. Weather I opt for the gold star breakfast sandwich or the omelette of the day, the food is consistently delicious. Plus bottomless coffee and caesars made with Walter's clamato and topped with cool ranch Doritos? Yes please. They are also always playing 90s hip hop, which my old hungover bones find very soothing.   Tip: if you're a group over two, expect a bit of a wait for a table during peak hours. This place is popular but they don't rush people out the door."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the restaurant is super dirty. Came for brunch and once I sat down, I was stuck to the seat. I ended up with oil stains on my pants from the seat. The table was also sticky, along with all the utensils. It was one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences based on cleanliness. I would not come back."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is quite cozy with the warm sun shining through the front glass, experimental electronic music and rustic decor; these features right here already make for a great place to lounge for a drink or sip on a cappuccino, but don't stop by if you have an inversion to hipsters as you're sure to see plenty of beards flannel and skinny jeans.  My two favorite entrées here are the Cubano and the Gold standard. But everything is great and made from fresh ingredients. Quarters are tight so you may have to settle with eating at the bar or waiting for a spot to free up but it's well worth it. I visit this establishment about once every two months."}
{"text":"I had a burger and it was very tasty but small.  Nice little quiet spot.  It did not have a great selection of alcohol - my first complaint.  My second complaint is that the portions are all so small - my friend had clam pasta dish and it was the size of a soup.  This places lack identity I felt - if not a meal place, need something else like a great selection of liquor for example or a live band or something."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I've had. I've been meaning to come here for sometime just never have. Last night I felt in the brunch mood, so I made plans to meet a friend early on a Saturday to enjoy some breakie. We agreed to meet at 9:30am to beat the brunch rush. And we did exactly that. We spent an hour here with food and copious amounts of coffee. By the time we left at 10:30am the place was filling up.   Service was friendly and prompt. Very chill and relax atmosphere plus some great tunes. I love the decor and ambience. The food though. The food was brunch perfection. I had the cubano which was everything that a sandwich should be. Roasted pork, bacon, aioli, avocado and pickles packed between toasted sourdough. The best! Also the side arugula salad and hash browns were delicious. Quality ingredients and fresh. Also the bottomless drip is delicious. The cocktail, beer and wine lists are well curated featuring a lot of local and Ontario offerings.   I can't wait to come back. I'll be dreaming of this sandwich though."}
{"text":"If it's not on the list now, expect to see The Federal on a \"best brunch in Toronto\" list soon. My friends and I went here on a Tuesday around 10:30am for brunch and left satisfied.  The Federal is a small restaurant in West Dundas, a neighborhood with plenty of quality restaurants and cafes. When you walk in, you're flanked by two glass windows that look once part of a pharmacy. Walking in, you'll see the bar in the back, brick walls, and several tables in a small room. Despite the size, they make good use of space and fit our group of five, including a high chair for our 16-month baby.   The service was decent (it's a hipster place so expect a little attitude from the staff) and the food good. I ordered Eggs Federal, an English muffin stuffed with bacon, poached eggs, and the most creamy mushroom tarragon sauce. For drinks, they have brunch cocktails AND hard cider ON TAP!  My entire Toronto trip, I craved another Eggs Federal breakfast sandwich. Go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a really cute place on Dundas west and their brunch is what they are mostly known for. But that doesn't mean that this place doesn't make a great dinner spot as well.   I have been here for brunch many times. The dishes that I've had here for brunch are the Eggs Federal, the Cubano Sandwich and the Smoked Trout Plate. The Eggs Federal is their version of an Eggs Benedict and it is delicious! One of the best breakfast dishes in town. I highly recommend it. The Cubano is a really solid sandwich. I think I prefer this sandwich over the ones I've had at La Cubana that specializes in these sandwiches, so that just goes to show how good I think this sandwich is. My least favourite, but still a great plate is the Smoked Trout Plate. The cheddar scones make this dish.  Last night we came here for dinner and I ordered the Four Guys Burger with Animal Style Curly Fries. This is definitely one of the best burgers in the city. It's incredibly juicy and messy, finger licking messy though. The curly fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and stay that way even when you animal style it and does not get soggy with the melted cheese and sautéed onions on top. Definitely come here for brunch or dinner when you get a chance. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Wow blew my mind. Nice location and beautiful décor. Awesome staff and the food made my day. The Cubano sandwich is the beat sandwich I've had I quite a while. Homemade root beer?! What!!!  I'll be back for more."}
