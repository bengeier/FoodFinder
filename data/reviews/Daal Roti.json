{"text":"We were here yesterday evening and had a good time.

We've also been to the old location too a couple of years ago. In comparison, their newer location has more space, more lighting and better seating arrangements.

Our visit last night was a good one. We had ordered:

Mix Veg platter (comes with 3 pieces each of corn tikki, hara bhara kebab, paneer tikka and spring rolls). 

Paneer kalameeri, kofta masala, daal tadka, jeera rice, masala naan, chili cheese naan and onion kulcha. The daal tadka wasn't as good as the other two curries. The curries were very well seasoned and tasted great. The masala naan was definitely way more spicy than expected (and I love spicy food!)...wish the server had warned us. But all in all, we loved the food, the curries were seasoned very well and I love that the dishes had distinct flavours. 

Paan kulfi for dessert...nearly broke the spoon trying to bite into this. Tasted good, not bad. Incredibly small quantity though for the price. 

In fact, as others have pointed out, for most of the items the quantity is a bit on the low end for the price charged.

Here's a breakdown of our experience:

Ambience: 4/5 music was a bit too loud 

Service: 3/5 some of the staff do need proper training on serving the food, plates and checking for water.

Food: 5/5 can't complain! 

Price: $$ 

Overall: 4/5 and I would recommend for a family visit, they have lots of options on their menu and food doesn't taste like every other restaurant's.

Tip: We had an 8 pm reservation for a Friday night and were surprised to see no crowds at all. Although, it might've been an exception because I am aware of their long wait times, so always better to call in advance to book a table."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I generally don't go out to eat punjabi food anymore. I find that all thr restaurants use the same form of gravy for all their curries, with maybe a few variations to the colours. So I wasnt initially expecting much from this place. But I was pleasantly surprised with the food. 

We placed a catering order for the hara-bhara kebabs, paneer tikka, veg reshmi, naan, daal fry, salad and fruit custard. Although we were given a different nanna from the kne we tasted at the restaurant  the curries were just as delicious as the ones in the restaurant. Overall the food was very close to what I believe authentic Indian food should taste like.

For around 40 people there was quite a bit of food leftover, but everyone loved it so much that they decided to parcel it home."}
{"text":"Great Food!!! 
Very impress with Jain & SwamiNarayan options.
Customer Service is great and staff is friendly.
I recommand this place."}
{"text":"Variety of their open buffet is limited. Chicken doesn't taste great. Limited dessert selection - no fruits apart from orange quarters."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever found at the new location. I went there with my family on my sister's birthday it took them 1 hour to get us seated and as soon as they made us seated they were there to take an order. Washrooms didn't had any tissues and  they are so unhygienic. It all started with the server being pushy in taking our order. I asked them to give us a moment and to this the server said we have people waiting. Who the hell talks to their customers like that. Also when we ordered Naan before rice.  we  were served rice before the naan, and upon arrival of rice we requested to cancel the order for naan as it didn't make sense to have just naan after rice. So the waitress got mad at us and said you cannot cancel the order you guys should  know that we are busy. Then the store owner came in the picture and started making gender discriminating comments such as, \" is this the way you talk with your wife? \" 
On top of that when they billed us they charged us for the naan which we never got and which we requested to cancel. when we  asked to remove it from the bill the lady owner acted super smart and said just pay $2 less but actually they had billed us $2 plus tax so she wanted the tax portion of an item which we never got. It seems that those people are hungry for your pennies. My advice is please check your receipts before you leave from there. not a good experience will never go to this restaurant till death."}
{"text":"This place sucks, terrible service. Made a reservation for 8:30, didnt get seated until 9:30 after i told them that i could no longer wait and was going to leave.. If i could give a 0 star rating i would"}
{"text":"Fantastic and best in Mississauga based on price and quality of their dishes. Me and wife have tried almost everything on their menu. It's rare to find a Indian place where everything is so yummy.  Favourites - cashew masala, paneer kalameeri, chicken lababdar, tikka masala, vada pav, etc"}
{"text":"Restaurant is small cozy. Although we had two hours waiting period at the restaurant it was worth waiting. Food just tastes good brings memory back from India. Loved their cheese butter masala and paneer tikka masala. And service was friendly."}
{"text":"Food - 7.5/10
Prices - 9/10
Service - 3/10

Went with my dad on Friday night, they seated us immediately albeit at a crappy table with crappy chairs.  We ordered:

- Hariyali Chicken Tikka for appetizer
- Daal Tarka
- Madras Chicken Curry
- Some plaine rice
- 3 rotis

The hariyali chicken came out after about 20 minutes, the rest of the food came out another 40 minutes after the hariyali chicken.  3 tables of 4 people or more came in after us and got their food a good 15 minutes before us.  I asked the waiter if I had ordered something that takes a really long time and why was it that the rest of the tables were getting their food left and right and we weren't.  He came up with a feeble excuse, he said that the hariyali chicken tikka takes a long time but the rest of the food we ordered is very quick.  So I didn't push it any further because clearly he was making an excuse for a screw up in the kitchen.  If it was the hariyali chicken that takes so long, why did it take 40 minutes for the food which in his words is quick?  Hey waiter, learn to take responsibility for your kitchen's cockups, and send the manager over when a customer has been screwed.

So, in summary, if you want above average food and good prices, with lots of choices, but with poor service in that \"here eat this and shutup\" line of typical desi restaurants, with noisy screaming children, no sense of order, no ambiance, then this place is for you and there is legitimately a market for this type of experience, it's just not for me.  When I go to eat dinner, I expect to be treated with respect and dignity and I expect my food to come out in a timely fashion, otherwise I'd rather cook at home.

Would not recommend this for dine in.  Take out, probably."}

They are amazing. The menu is very extensive, prices are very reasonable, service is friendly and efficient considering how busy they are and the taste of food is very good and very authentic. My only gripe is the long wait time to get a table. We have waited for 30-40 mins even after reservation. We'll never go there without a reservation as it's very busy and they are swamped by the takeout orders too.

Make a reservation. Plan some extra time for wait and go enjoy the delicious food. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I actually find the customer service very good and the prices are fantastic for the portions. For under $10, I can get a full meal with huge naan bread and it's all that I can do to finish it (and as you can see from my past reviews, I normally find portions too small.) It's my favorite place to go for lunch and I think people are being too harsh or maybe need to try it again to see if they've worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"I went to the new location. While the place may be bigger, the attitude of the owner has not changed much. I don't know what it would take for this lady to smile. 

When I am out at a restaurant to eat, I am there not just for the food but also for the ambiance and customer service. I think it is too much to as for from these people. 

Restaurant business is customer facing and the owner does not have a customer centric attitude or personality. She is very cold and seems like has a chip on her shoulder. 

We have catered from this place in the past and we tip really well. A smile is the least you can ask for. 

As one of the yelpers mentioned, it may be a family business but it is still a business. 

As far as the food is concerned, I have noticed that most of the curries taste the same! And I am not exaggerating. We had one veg and non veg curry. Both tasted the same! 

They have a ton of dishes but if everything tastes the same, there is no point in having so many. 

I may go here for take out once in a while. But I will not dine in. 

I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my second visit at Daal Roti, first time dining in. I remember meeting the owner Payal who is very pro active and attentive to the demands of most customers. We ordered butter chicken, chicken lababdar, baingan(eggplant) patiala, chicken biryani and lachcha parathas. I remember relishing the Tadka Daal(tempered lentils) last time and that is also highly recommended. Food and service were both very good and reasonably priced. Please do not go there without a reservation as it's really busy. Thanks to Payal and her team for looking after us and giving us an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Go there for lunch a lot. I fancy myself an indian food connoisseur (as in I eat a lot of it, have been to India a few times and generally know when I like something or not). What this place lacks in decor it more than makes up for in quality of food. The Roti or Naan is always fresh and the buffet food at lunch is fresh and doesn't weigh you with down with Ghee paralysis for the rest of the day. I have been there for dinner a la carte as well and it was equally good. Recommend this place if you are looking for no nonsense quality northern style indian Food."}
{"text":"Decided to have a get-together catered from here because this place is new and had heard decent reviews about it.
The décor inside is very warm and nice for the most part, with well designed booths. It seems that they haven't finalized their seating, because the tables had sofas on one side and plastic chairs on the other. 
Food we got was: two veg. curries, shahi paneer and malai mattar (paneer had too much ketchup flavor), tadka daal (good), rice (well-cooked), roti/naan (good), etc. 
service was quick. 
Can't give it five stars because the paneer could have been better."}
{"text":"Soulfully satisfied every time I go there! It doesn't get old! When the food touches your inner soul then you know you had the best meal!"}
{"text":"Oh relax you guys on the bad service. 

It's a family that runs the show -- two of them.  

Great food.  Great lunch buffet.

{"text":"I got food poisoning after eating here on September 8th. Never again. I've been ill ever since I ate there. My friend got sick as well."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. i have placed an order on phone at 7:17 pm. i was told that waiting time will be 1 hour???? seriously??? came to pick up the food after an hour. no one on service desc for 10 minutes. finally got some one at service desk n they didnt have any record of my order. after a while i was told it will be 20 minutes agian.. really?? after waiting for almost 2 hours again have to wait for 20 minutes? worst service ever.. so disorganised management."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing food. My all time favorite. I have been going to this place for years and it's been pretty consistent. 

I love Kaju masala and Daal Tadka."}
{"text":"Great food. We use to visit the old location and just tried the new one.  We have only tested a lunch buffet and have always been pleased.  The restaurant satisfies the vegitarians and meat eaters in our group.  Come early as the new location is busy.  We will come again."}
{"text":"The place is super crowded and the waiting time were super long... 
We decided to wait since we heard amazing reviews about this place and we were super disappointed. 
We waited for an hour or so to get the table... The food was not that extraordinary... 
Giving it 3 stars because the dessert was good.
While we were waiting we decided to have some drinks till then and we ordered Mango Lassi which tasted nothing like Lassi and it tasted more like melted Shrikhand or diluted shrikhand to be precise... and in that wait period we saw bunch of customers getting mad because of the wait time and mainly because they had to wait for a very long time even after placing order for simple things like a daal... 
We tried cheese butter masala, kaju masala and veg makhanwala... Kaju Masala was good... Cheese butter masala barely had any cheese and was just gravy... veg makhanvala was made with the frozen vegetable mix of carrots, green peas and beans... nothing extraordinary or special... 
We also tried paan kulfi and raajbhog and they were amazing..."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch take out. Great price for the food you get - $7 for naan, a meat curry, a veggie curry, and naan. And it comes in a nice takeout box (I never thought that would really matter, but it does). 

Secondly, the food. The naan was soft and warm, perfect texture and level of moisture. The rice was aromatic, the daal was great too. The butter chicken had great flavours and the meat was juicy, albeit I would have preferred to see a little more meat to sauce ratio. I'd come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"We went here on a friend's recommendation for the amazing \"Daal\" and it lived up to every single word of praise. 

We started off with the appetizer of \"Sev Puri\" which was totally amazing. The spice, the lime and the crunchiness of the sev and the puri were great. For the main, we went for their signature Daal Tadka and Achaari Baigan along with some Rotis. Daal Tadka truly lived up to the reputation. The smokey flavor provided that extra bit of heat to the Daal along with all the spices. Absolutely loved it. Achaari Baigan was also amazing. The similar smokey flavor was found in Achaari Baigan too but due to different ingredients and a few different mixes of spices, it didn't really become a repetition. 

The ambiance of the place is good. Very family friendly and have a decent seating capacity. The staff was nice in general although we had a bit of incident at the beginning as we entered the restaurant and for a couple of minutes none of the staff members came to attend us and get us seated - contrary to common practice. Later on, we were told that it would have been fine for us to come and just grab the seat - something not expected in this type of restaurant. 

Overall, it's a great place to have a meal with family. Definitely, the place to go if you are a Daal-lover!!"}
{"text":"Daal Roti is definitely a different sort of Indian restaurant compared to any other Indian restaurant in Toronto (in my opinion). As advertised, their food does have a very Mumbai taste to it. If you have been living in Toronto for a while, you'll agree with me when I say that no matter which Indian restaurant you go to in Toronto, the Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, Paneer Tikka and Palak Paneer are basically identical at all the major Indian restaurants. Not at this place though. The chef is the owner and he's created his own recipes for the different dishes they offer. My family goes there once every two weeks and have been a regular there ever since they discovered the restaurant. The cleanliness at the new spot is great. The staff is reasonably courteous. The food is delicous.

For the Gujarati people looking for the \"Indian\" taste of the curries, this is the place to go.

{"text":"I don't know where to begin for this review since the amount of flaws we encountered on our night was ridiculous. 
Daal roti is a north indian restaurant, however it is known to have some gujurati flavours because of the owner or chef. This restaurant is extremely small, with like perhaps 6-7 tables meant for 4 people. I went there having made a reservation for 7.15pm but despite this I ended up waiting for a table for around half an hour. When finally given a table, menus were abruptly thrown on our table. When ready to order we had to call out for a server. We had a question about a menu item before placing the order, whereby the server did not know the answer to and said that she will go inside and ask. We waited 10 minutes and this server did not come back. We again had to call out for a server and finally placed the order. While waiting for the food we heard like 2 tables complaining that the food is taking too long to arrive. Then at one point a server went to serve a table and ended up dropping his tray that contained water and a few plates. Everything looked so disorganized to me. The servers were also all over the place looking as if they had no idea what they were doing.
I was starving and it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order. When the food was served I was pretty disappointed because my chicken vindaloo literally looked like oil cooked with chicken rather than chicken cooked in oil since the curry was floating with oil. However, the flavor of the curry was really good and spicy, the way I like it. I asked for tandoori roti with my curry. Tandoori curry isn't usually served with butter on it, but they did put butter on mine. I had to ask them change mine, which took 5 minutes and me waiting there staring at my curry getting cold.
     The only positive thing I can say about this is place is that they offer paan ice cream, which was pretty amazing and a must try.
     Finally we went up to the front to pay the bill. We wanted to split the bill, which resulted in such confusion for them. It took forever for the lady to understand how we wanted to split the bill, which wasn't very complicated.
Therefore, I will only be going to Daal Roti if I am craving for paan ice cream but other than that I will not step in here again since there are better indian restaurants out there that won't make you feel like you've drunk a bowl of oil and will serve you efficiently."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall restaurant that we stumbled on.
Very spartan decor.

However we came for the food.
There was a lunch buffet spread with the usual Indian food like butter chicken, goat curry and other dishes.
The food itself was decently tasty so was good value.

I didn't use the washrooms on this visit however my lunch mate mentioned that it needs sprucing up..."}
{"text":"Went with my son today for lunch Daal Roti. As they advertising on their window is almost $12 for lunch.  Total bill for one adult and kid it should be $27.12 including tax because they doesn't have kid price. But the total bill from what they charge is $31.62 it seem not $12 /person or they automatic charge for tips?  Is tips mandatory?"}
