{"text":"C'est simple, je cherchais une place où parker mon corps en attendant mon lift, après une séance infructueuse de magasinage à l'armée du salut sur Notre-Dame. Une chance que j'ai marché au hasard plutôt que d'en chercher un sur Yelp, parce qu'il est pas apparu sur la carte quand j'ai voulu faire un check-in!! Le bonheur ici c'est dans le décor et le service - je dirais que le café est \"correct\" tirant sur le \"bon\". C'est pas le Station W, mais c'est quand même très acceptable!! 
La dame qui m'a servie était tellement fine, je pense qu'elle aurait pu me jaser toute la journée. Je dirais que ça vaut la peine de s'arrêter! 
Important: y'a de la bouffe mais juste froide (viennoiseries, sandwichs). À essayer next time!"}
{"text":"I think this is a cute, chic, and aesthetically appealing coffee shop. Made a quick stop here with some friends while trying to kill some time before heading down to Birdbar which is down the street. The owner, I assume, was very pleasant and really seemed to take pride in her shop. I would definitely revisit if I was in Canada simply to look at the art alone."}
{"text":"Not bad Americano. The dark roast is far worse than the light. Though they may change their beans so that's not a gurmarantee. When it's good it is great, when it's not, it's pretty bad. Consistency is the problem."}
{"text":"The MOST ARTSY café in town! In fact it is a two-in-one: Café and gallery. Pieces of artwork of different artists are showcased here and this lovely café really let your imagination go wild! I love how quiet and bright it is, perfect to study and read a good book. They also offer a variety of art books (JPGauthier, Dali, Impressionists) to consult for free! Their coffee is also very good, I tried the filter coffee, even though I would have liked it a bit richer, the balance of the berries and jasmin taste of the coffee was great! The owner is super nice and respectful, I simply love this café!"}
{"text":"I passed by and found this unbelievable place. It's like studying in gorgeous art gallery.

I immediately fell in love with the place after one visit. The service was absolutely great and coffee was fresh. I'd keep on coming here and recommend it to all."}
