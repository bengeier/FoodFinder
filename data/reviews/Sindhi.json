{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place. I always take someone new with me to try out this place. The prices are great and so is the service. You HAVE to try the choor bazaar ka tikka it is finger lickin good 10/10."}
{"text":"I just loved the food here...tried the Mamajis sandwich..keema pav...sai bhaji and rara ghost...and each and every dish was yummy...this is definitely going to be my must visit food place every time I can"}
{"text":"I have been living in this area for the last 9 years and I pretty much try out every new thing that opens up. I have read all the negative reviews and I decided to give it the benefit of doubt anyways . I went in with the understanding that things will come late and the service will be bad.  Well, I was wrong . we ordered both the veg and non veg thali , pau bhaji and the oh so good eggplant fries , those were awesome for $5! The afternoon ended with malai and mango kulfi , which were apparently made specifically for this joint and totally lived up to the standard   The servers were awesome , food came in 10 minutes ! The decor is very modern and I loved the steel open shelves giving a peek at the kitchen . The whole restaurant has a nice unique vibe with funny quotes all over the place   I am going back , and taking my family of 20 for a stress test . I'm certain the owners read the bad firsr day reviews online and promptly acted to fix it"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and very clean ambience. The meat was very fresh and tender , we ate here twice and the quality was very good."}
{"text":"Based on the food alone I am giving this place 5 stars! On my way home from work I finally stopped by, after eyeing it week after week, I ordered a chaat dish and thali fish. The chaat was incredible! I can't even describe the array of flavours, to do it justice. It was a mix of salty, sweet and sour, and deliciousness. There were these lil crispy discs topped with a mix of chutneys, yogurt, garbanzo beans and spices. I kept telling myself \"ok, one more bite.....\" And all of a sudden. It was all gone! Haha! The thali dish had 3 different dishes in one, there was the fish curry with a coconut milk based curry, a savoury lentil curry and then a creamy paneer curry, served with a fragrant basmati rice and side of cucumbers and red onion. Naan and a small papadum was also given. Wow! Just wow! This is one of those places that I would gladly drive out of my way to go get. I will definitely be back! I hope this place stays in business a very long time. I highly recommend that you try them out! I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Originally came for the shop next door to get kulfi but their selection sucked, so walked into Sindhi asking if they had dessert. The waitress there literally said: \"just get the falooda, trust me on this!\"  So we did and it was amazing! Usually, I prefer kulfi over falooda any day, but this was just amazing and it had kulfi in it.  Definitely want to come back to try the other foood."}
{"text":"Great service, very good food..went several times. Love their breakfast items! Overall something really different other than chicken tikka masala or butter chicken!!"}
{"text":"One of the finest food in town. All made from scratch and tasty. Good customer service and we have been greeted in less than a min.   Will definitely go again and will recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"Being from India and craving some good Indian street food, decided to visit this place. Very disappointed with the food, definitely not authentic Indian street food as they claim. Ordered Sindhi biryani and it was 12pm but was told for that we need to come in after 1pm for that. So ordered a thali, pau bhaji (one of my favourite street dishes) and Bhendi Bazaar Seekh Kabab. The thali was ok, quantity was not bad for the price.  Pau Bhaji as explained on the menu is mashed vegetables, what we got was large pieces of carrots, peas and other vegs, the spices used were definitely not the traditional pau bhaji spices, can't go wrong with buttered / toasted bread! So disappointed, as it was not even in the least bit spicy or tangy which is what this dish should be. The kababs, (not sure how to attach a photo to this), $11 for 2 small pieces of kabab? What a joke. Hopefully the service and food will get better, understandably this is a new restaurant but absolutely not worth the price.  After eating the food. the reason for the Sindhi Rule# 2 posted in the restaurant was clear, t reads some along these line: Food after being eaten cannot be returned !!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant four times in the one month that it has been open. The food is delicious, prices are extremely reasonable and  the portions are pretty good. The owners have stopped to chat with us each time we have been there, the decor is unique and has a humor to it. Some of my favourite items are Gosht doubleroti (the winner each time), Koki, keema pau, Sharmaji Ka Chaat and Amrtitsari Kulcha  are some of the things that I have tried and loved. Hemant, the owner, is still in the process of finalizing the menu and hence the menu might change slightly each time you go there. Also, given that it is a new place, there are some hiccupss in the service but nothing that isn't expected from a new venture. I am very glad that we finally have a restaurant in the city that offers great sindhi food. I am definitely a frequent customer."}
{"text":"We waited for half an hour for a table but the staff didn't even make eye contact with us nor had the common courtesy to acknowledge us. People kept coming in and waiting same as us but no one was being helped. The place was busy but tables were getting vacant periodically however the staff were not quick enough to clear them and seat the next customers. We just walked out and will never return."}
{"text":"Been there first last Friday and was so impressed with the food, our group of 5, returned again on Sunday. This is as close you get to sindhi food and Indian street food done like in Bombay. We had sharmaji ka chaat, gosht dabalroti (lamb and bread in sindhi), saibhaji (authentically and as close as my grandmom would have made it), keema pau(as made by Iranian restaurants in Bombay). I think the authenticity maybe lost by people from other parts of India or who are not familiar with sindhi food, but this one gets a 5 star from me. They are still trying to iron out some teething issues it seems, like long waits etc but the food triumphed all that for us!"}
{"text":"Sindhi was a good different experience. I would definitely recommend Sharmaji Ki Chat. We also tried Chicken Thali which was nice. Nice arrangement."}
{"text":"This place is refreshingly different and has good tasting food, but the last time I went here with my family, we all got an upset stomach, so probably won't be coming back for a while.  P.S. The cauliflower dish is amazing."}
{"text":"One star for cleanliness and one for location   No one welcomes you in...you kind of figure it out yourself...food is a hit or a miss...some days its just very poor ..mostly weekdays...staff doesn't care for your complaints or feel like they need to fix anything...got bad food and I mentioned that 2 out of three things had too much salt and I didn't eat it...still got charged full price..and no ownership ...blame passed on but I had to pay for their lack of customer service skills.  Its not street food at all..its kind of missing its identity...its all over the place...like a overrated Indian dhaba...  Concept is new but food lacks love and nothing that would make me return ."}
{"text":"Why 2 stars? Well the first time I came here I tried the chaat and it was nice. $6 no complaints. But when my friends and I came here to try out the main dishes we we really disappointed with the serving sizes. The kabob dish on had 2 pieces for $12 bucks. And also their chicken tikka dish came with 4 small pieces one person could devour in 2 minutes. Another $13. Also service was not good. They left us for a good 40 min just to check on us. Not a fan. Masala bites for me."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here.  One word. AMAZING.  The food selection is great.  The quality is really good. Loved the chaat, pani puri, and Pau bhaji.  Polite service and the food came in 5 minutes even though the restaurant was packed!  Can't wait to come back with my whole family!  The cutting tea is on point!"}
{"text":"I love their Thali, halwa poori, pithiwali poori. The place is clean especially rest rooms. The paneer kabobs were overly spiced up, and I could taste the raw spice. The flaky parottas seemed like kaavan frozen parotta."}
{"text":"Everything besides the food at Sindhi is kind of fantastic. The decor is amazing and so is the ambiance. When you go in there, it's truly something new, old and different all at once. Loved the Bhagat Singh mural too.   But, the food was exceedingly mediocre if not bad. It lacked spices and any tang. The service was inconsistent too. After the raised expectations from the appearance of the store, the food was a big let down. The veggies in the thali lacked masala. The pani puri was low  on the tang. And I dont know why the falooda was served in an open faced style with a spoon with barely any ice cream.   I hope to see them grow because GTA needs a place like this. It's got great potential in terms of both locale and clientele. Hope for it to grow and change. Would love to revisit"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and quick one. Had a chicken and a lamb thali naan(hot and tasty)food was delicious and tasty and the amount of food was perfect would definitely go again for breakfast. The food came out very fast we didn't wait to long. I think it's the best thali I had so far"}
{"text":"This is another gem of a restaurant by Hemant Bhagwani. We are a big fan of his Indian Street Food co.(fine dine) and Amaya chain. We stopped by at Baklava King and Sindhi was a couple of doors down. We were craving for chaat(Indian evening snacks) so we thought of giving it a try. As soon as we walked in, we kinda knew it's one of Hemant Bhagwani's as the decor was very familiar and the menu was innovative.  We just had chaat there and that's why I'm rating it as 4-star. Will visit them soon again for lunch/dinner and update my review.  Mississauga folks, this is one restaurant to watch out for in your neighborhood. Do expect great things from them, and they shall deliver."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Their chaat is absolutely delish ($6.99)...must try! I love the thick yogurt, mint and tamarind on top of the chaat and potatoes. Also they add a few pomegranates which I've never seen before. Overall yummy! Also their chicken kebab with soft buttery roti is delicious...small portion sizes though for the price ($11.99). Their kadhai chicken special was a miss..it was just ok...service is slow"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The price was reasonable and they give huge portions. I was having trouble finishing my thali. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Need better service and more clarity on Menu items. Adding pictures or IPad Menu can be big help."}
{"text":"3 words: Indian Street Food. The inside of this restaurant really epitomizes the street food theme. Beautifully painted place with super cute and witty Sindhi jokes on banners; 5/5 for ambiance. The serving dishes are also very traditional and eye-appealing. I'd highly recommend their pani puri, sharmaji ki chaat, haryali chicken tikka, masala cola, and sindhi biryani! Seekh kabob are very average. Moreover, serving sizes are quite small. The chai is astounding in taste but never served as hot as you want it."}
{"text":"Bunch of empty tables, but couldn't seat us. Waiting there for a good 10 minutes before they finally told us they weren't able to accommodate us (with a solid 12 seats free). Learn to manage your front of house better."}
{"text":"Ordered BHENDI BAZAAR SEEKH KEBAB, CHOR BAZAAR KA CHICKEN TIKKA and BUTTER CHICKEN FRIES.  Total coat of the meal 38$ CAD.  Food was below average for my taste flavour notes were mild to bland. by any standard was not even close to street food that belongs to any place in Sindh.  The sheikh kabob was similar to one sold in the frozen version avaliable in local stores.   My impressions are clean place but food is below average and won't go here again."}
{"text":"We were nearby then we decided to try it out. Restaurant wasn't full since its there First Working Monday. Service was fast, nice and very welcoming. Price compare to portions was not expensive comparing to other Indian fancy restaurant. Taste was very very delicious. Butter chicken and lamp bryani with garlic Naan was really amazing.The only thing I asked for baby highchair wasn't clean as expected, the same with menus. For sure you have to try it."}
{"text":"First time coming to Sindhi and the food was excellent. All of the food including the garnishes and chutneys were fresh and tasted as if they were made in house. The service was great. Good personality and fast service. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a well-decorated, clean Indian restaurant. It's not cluttered, but seems like it's still trying to figure itself out. Overall, I like the ambiance.   Food was good - but I didn't get to try a lot. I had the Sindhi Chicken Biryani, which I personally liked. It's very concentrated... as in there is no white Biryani rice - all covered in the sauce. I like spicy biryani, so this was right up my alley. However not everyone likes it this way. I didn't get to try anything else this time, but I do hope to come back.   I like street food, and I was kind of hoping they would have some things ready \"to-go\". Or have a \"street cart\" style set up so they will make things right away, in front of you. That's my favourite part of street food at least."}
{"text":"Simply said this place is great! Fresh, hot , cool, plate after plate the food was perfect. The four of us really enjoyed the menu choice,the decor and the somewhat approximate but smiling service. Prices are very reasonable and we will surely make this place a must stop lunch destination when in missisauga."}
{"text":"Funny cute place. Read each and every wall. Food is good, a typical Indian street food. Pretty reasonable. It is not a fine dining place so don't go with that expectations. Just chill and enjoy local street food from India."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely tasty. We ordered the achari paneer, mutton biryani, paratha and hariyali chicken. All we're really flavourful and fresh! The only thing is that the minimum wait time is half an hour but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ambience & Decor: Ethnic, contemporary, very high ceilings & open concept seating plan. (4 stars) Service: Service is good, the staff are welcoming. 3.5 stars. Food: Is good a few dishes like halwa/puri/chole, veg thali are outstanding. (4stars)  The vada pav & pav bhaji were okay, the amritsari kulcha was good. (3 stars) The Sindhi ka Rabdi Falooda which is a signature dessert was very disappointing. Had to ask if rabdi was added, the falooda was water logged & over cooked, the whole dish was not sweet enough.  The place is interesting enough to revisit."}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience.. pooris were oily and when I returned my meal, got yelled back at for returning it. Don't think I would recommend anyone... Either for food or for store etiquette"}
{"text":"Update: they now have nestle water and they said specially for me cuz i always ask for bottled water!!! Lol this is great thanks for listening  Their goat curry is drop dead amazingg!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent desi food with authentic flavors. Ambience and service is very good too. Definitely try the pav bhaji and mutton rogan josh."}
{"text":"Love this place! My friends and I come here often and the food is flavourful and different from any other desi food I've tried in Mississauga. Everything is also affordable and the service is usually very nice :) the only issue is that it can take a while to get your food. Also the decor is so nice and retro. It's definitely one of my fave hangout spots!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was so-so as it took awhile for us to get a menu.  When we were ready to pay we asked for the bill and the waiter said we had to pay at the cash like we were supposed to know that. Overall great tastes of sindhi Indian flavours."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant suggests it's a street food place, so my expectation was to have some hearty, authentic Indian food that are reasonably priced. Well, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Here's my story. I went there for a quick lunch food grab. I noticed the ambience is nice and unique. I skimmed through the menu and ordered a shrimp curry priced at 12.99 pre tax if I'm not wrong. I coupled this dish with a garlic naan. So when the dish came up, I was shocked to find out this dish only contains THREE shrimps. Wow, and they are not even big by any standards. So three shrimps and some curry is apparently worth more than 16 bucks if you round up the tax and tips. Then I quickly finished the small piece of naan along with the curry, still felt merely half fed. So I had to order another garlic naan bread, which is priced at 2.99 I think. So I ended up paying 20+ in the end, for a lunch oh yes. To be fair, the food didn't taste bad at all,but that's almost irrelevant. Instead it's just hard to manage the gap between expectation and final cost. Come on, it's a self styled street food place in suburb Mississauga, not a medium or high end Indian restaurant in the centre of Toronto. For this price I wouldn't revisit."}
{"text":"Had this spot on my to do list and honestly was a bit turned down. From being very empty, to slow service I just didn't click with the place. We tried a few items, chaat, pani puri which were ok not the best, also the cup of chai was watered down. Btw, tried ordering chicken Tandoori and it was not available, the waiter recommended the Tikka which I passed on as they had a few ready made hanging over the tandoor which probably had our name on it....maybe not freshly made like it's supposed to be. Not again for us"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. It was made with a modern twist. However the customer service was extremely poor. Would go back but for takeout. But dining in experience was not that great at all. Even though the modern interior was awesome."}
{"text":"The flavours were there...however, the butter chicken we ordered was more soup than chicken.  6 very small pieces of chicken in sauce, 2 naan and order of rice = $22 = low value in my books."}
{"text":"I read some rather unflattering reviews both here and on google and was a bit dubious when I went here. Four of us, classmates from Mumbai, meeting after 30 plus years.  And you know what - the food was very good. The place has a cool vibe with lots of Sindhi jokes that would be funny to those with context. Menu is extensive with large choice for vegetarians. One can go tapas style by sharing a large number of appetizers or order mains. I ordered the Bombay Vada pav, a Sindhi dish with daal and some fried roti like bread and some lassi. All were great and quite attractively priced. Around 6-7 for appetizers and 10-12 for mains. Service is friendly but a bit slow. I'm sure I'll go there again as there's a lot to explore on this menu."}
{"text":"The place, its ambiance, cleanliness in dining area, washrooms and open kitchen is amazing and refreshing.   Service : Not so good. The staff does not know anything about the menu, I asked how many puri in one order ? Reply : \"I don't know\" Didn't even offer to ask the kitchen. HAVE to force him to go check.Every thing on the menu we asked about he had no clue what so ever.  Also they always come back to collect the menu printed on the paper while we are still reading it.   It was stated that puri are thin fluffy traditional puri. But it turned out to be the hard one that other restaurants call pathora. Channa with this item is black small , hard affair with no gravay at all. Puri was still ok, but chana were hard to eat they are very small in size, shows lowest quality and not cooked right. I did google for this item and it turn out not to be the authentic sindhi item as it is liested in the menu with pathura and black chana.  Here is the thing with every desi brand place, when you ask the manager to improve the items, first thing they respond with \"No this is how it is made\"  Like the customer is wrong and customer never ever had this food before in the life.  We also ordered sharma ji ki chaat, wich is a good item but very expensive, for $6 the portion is shamelessly small.  We asked, if their meat is halal ? they said yes, when asked where you get it from, he said it is confidential,. Like seriously? again asking again the manager came and said it is from Kabul farms. Haven't got a chance to confirm from Kabul if they are really a supplier.  Same is the case with pani puri, 5 for $5   Food is average, hit and miss on difference items as stated by others  Service is lame and lazy, took them 15 minutes to serve chat and panu puri. 10 minutes to server halwa puri in two batches of two items each time  On top of all this the management is adamant that there is nothing wrong or need for improvement in their food. If I were owner, I would at least listen attentively to my customers, agree to them and assure them that their concerns will be addressed. customer service 101. Duh."}
{"text":"Great Service, Good Food, Clean Environment....  Since they have opened, we went there several times. Always had great service and fresh foods. The environment is different than most of other Indian restaurants. A good place to take family and friends for a nice casual meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced in my whole entire life (and I'm not exaggerating)! It all started when I walked in and asked the irrational owner if serves Bhel Puri as I saw it last time on the menu when I went for Masala Chai. He tells me no we took it off as no one orders it; albeit a little weird. Anyways, he suggested something else on the menu which I forgot (doesn't matter as I wouldn't even feed it to my worst enemy). Surprisingly I was still hungry and decided to have a \"main dish\" as I thought it would be a little better. I ordered the Chicken Tikka with Naan and when I ordered I was under the impression that it would take a while as it would be made fresh (this whole \"fresh\" thing it reiterated all over the walls). To my surprise (this place is full of surprises) it came out very fast; unusual for a Chicken Dish. Regardless of how fast it came out, any one who has had Chicken Tikka at a \"Regular Indian Restaurant\" would know that it doesn't come out dressed like a Taco! I even asked the waiter how I'm supposed to eat it; he then proceeded to tell a story about friends and drinks but that story is for another review. The food itself was sooo bad that I had a real issue finishing it (If you're wondering why I didn't complain; complaining at an Indian restaurant almost always doesn't work in your favour as I have experienced this before) the Chicken was chalky and definitely not \"fresh\".  I'll touch a very little bit on the service: As soon as you enter expect to be bombarded by who I assume to be the owner, he is almost always at the front waiting for any customers to walk in and BOOM! Once you order expect the paper take-out menu, which I thought I could keep to be snatched right from your hands. Truly an odd experience as you can see the owner put it on top of a pile of at least a thousand other paper menus. If the magical and very rare occasion occurs when you can actually KEEP a menu and you even glance at it, expect the owner (once again) to come running up asking if you want to order something more.  I have never experienced such bad food and never have I written such a negative review on Yelp. Do yourself a favour and STAY AWAY from this place!"}
{"text":"The decor was a refreshing change to the regular Indian restaurant. The food prices were ok but given the large portions it was a great value. I really enjoyed the overall experience and can't wait to go back. Would recommend this to anyone. Love the concept?"}
{"text":"Service - very attentive, quick and helpful.   Location - as others have mentioned, only way to get into plaza is Northbound on Confederation or Eastbound on Eglinton. Inside was clean, and open, lots of seating.   Food - got the Sharmaji Ki Chaat and the Masala cola. Cola was very tasty with the right amount of spice. Chaat was delicious and served as soon as it's completed as the puris were still very crisp. Portion sizes were good in relation to price.   Excited to return to explore the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is extremely average and reasonable. The problem with this place is it's extremely disorganized. We had to wait 20 minutes to place our order in off-peak hours. To be clear there were only two customers in their restaurant.  Next time, I will probably place an order to go. Their customer service is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Pros  - Liked the Sharma chaat, mutton rara ghost and mutton seekh kebabs - Courteous and attentive staff - big portions of the thalis - loved the 'bhuga' rice (or pulau as they advertise)  - conveniently located in the central part of city with ample parking.   Cons - The core Sindhi dishes were a bit disappointing. The dal pakwaan which is a signature Sindhi breakfast was a let down. The dal is supposed to be a mix of many daals and not just one.  - the pakwaan didn't taste great either. Thought it was not as crunchy plus I could see some oil on them. I know it's deep fried but I would have expected it to be well dried. - some tables have wooden chairs, they were a bit uncomfortable.    The ambience is alright. The lighting can be brighter."}
{"text":"Located on the SE corner of Eglinton/Confederation, this plaza is a bit difficult to access...unless you're travelling North on Confed or headed East on Eglinton.  Otherwise, be prepared to do a U-y or other illegal maneuver to pull into this new plaza.  Not only is the plaza new, but so is Sindhi and it's still working out the kinks.  This is a bit of confusion when you first step inside:  It's a seat yourself, order/pay at the counter, and food will be brought to your table.  Same as Paramount, but there is no greeter at the door.  There really should be a \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign, if no greeter.  Some menu items are also vague/unclear as to what \"Sindhi Special\" is, even for my Indian friend who came with.  Girl at the counter, non-Indian, hadn't tasted many items so do not depend on her recommendations.  Photos of menu items would be helpful, especially when description is not in terms that non-Indian folk would understand.  We ordered: -  Mango Lassi - $3 (quite thick and sweet, glass was filled to an awkward 3/4 level whereas I witness other glasses 90% full, inconsistent portions) -  Sharmaji Ki Chaat - $5 (quite good 'snack') -  Gosht Dabalroti - $7 (no crunchy sev on top - my Indian friend pointed this out to me, I wouldn't have known, lamb was well marinated and tender, but curry was served on 2 LARGE slices of bread which I was trying to avoid) -  Sindhi Ke Tikke Parantha - $9.90 (more on chunks of beef kabob, slices of red onion, pickled baby onions, on top of a naan than parantha, good flavour, but I found beef on the dry side)  Food was very decent, but again still some things to work out like customer confusion, long wait times at the cash, and also long wait for food to arrive IF a whole bunch of customers had ordered before you.  I found staff to be pleasant, but at times didn't pick up the empty dishes right away and informed customers about the procedure AFTER they've been sitting down for a while.  Definitely worth trying, but also bring your patience KNOWING that you're going into a new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Outstanding and amazing food! First time visit and completely amazed at the unique menu and variety of items they have. Kabab and goat curry were awesome. Would definitely add it to my frequent places to eat list"}
{"text":"Sinful Indian street food (chaat). Is that what you're craving for? Fret not, you know now where to find twisted, tangy, slurrrrrrpy goodies.  Everyone loves Sharmaji ki chaat. Must have. Aloo Tikki is served without chickpeas, deep fried in butter which reminded me of old school joints in mid tier Indian city markets. Paani Puri has distinct flavor which I haven't come across before. Think tangy and multiply that with a factor of 10. We always end up stuffing ourselves with these so next time we will be avoiding the temptation to sample other items. One can hope!  Unfortunately I am yet to reach the main course menu but my dearest loves their Sindhi Kadhi. She  wasn't too impressed with Chicken kebabs although I loved the Lachha Paratha accompanying the same.  Met a charming young fella, Huzefa, during our recent visit. Great customer service and wasn't shy of telling us that we were gonna kill ourselves with gluttony!  Update: Keema bun. Make it spicy n enjoy. Vada Paav. Crispy fresh n tasssty!"}
{"text":"First time.. Kind of like it... Good food and presentation.... Will surely come again..,"}
{"text":"This review was pretty difficult to make because (a) I went at the exact moment it opened it's doors to the public for the first time (b) the way the owner (I think) handled our situation at the end. I feel like my review may be unfair since I am reviewing it from their first day of opening. This is why I will visit again and based on that experience I will re-review it. However, this current review is solely based on my one time visit. Upon entering i really liked the modern decor they had, however I could instantly tell that they were a bit disorganized as all the servers were frantically pacing back and forth confused. I was immediately given a table and told that I should go up to the counter to order. This was a problem because a lot of the menu items I did not understand as they did not provide any descriptions and so I had to try several times to get a servers attention for some clarifications. When placing my order the lady writing my order down agreed to make some alterations I wanted t make to my order ( I ordered the Lamb paratha and my brother chose the pau bhaji and mango lassi).  10 minutes in and the restaurant was full. I then began to notice that people that came in after us got their food before us. The mango lassi still hadn't arrived 20 minutes later and while waiting the servers must have come to our table about 5 times with someone else's food, and about 7 times (not kidding!) to ask to repeat our orders. I think the main cause for this order confusion was that they did not have a table number system and therefore failed to remember which table ordered what. 45 minutes later the owner came up to us with a complimentary thali to apologize for the wait, which we really appreciated but since it was not what I ordered and wanted I was still inpatient and frustrated. 1 hour later my brothers pau bhaji was served so I basically had to sit there and watch him eat. By the time he was done mine finally arrived but they failed to carry out the alteration that I specifically asked for. After sending it back I waited another 15 minutes and mine arrived again, but yet it was not exactly what I asked for. Despite me starving to death I sent it back again and by this time I was furious. Finally mine arrived 10-12 minutes later. The lassi was a no show. Now to the taste: The thali was ok. I have definitely had better and is not something I would order during my re-visit. My brother seemed impartial to the pau bhaji and my lamb paratha wasn't bad, although I literally scarfed it down and barely tasted it since I was starving. The owner was really apologetic and insisted to give our whole meal on the house. That was a nice gesture, which definitely made me consider re-visiting sometime later when they have more time to get a hang of everything.      I can definitely see this restaurant doing well once they are all organized as they do have potential due to their unique menu items and experienced chefs."}
{"text":"Sindhi might not be the most authentic Indian food experience but I really enjoy the more modern vibe with minimalistic deco.  A twist of Indian's street food which is quite unique compares to other Indian restaurants in the area.  We arrived for late lunch (after 3 pm) and since the restaurant was not busy, we had full attention and service from the staff.  Prawn Koliwada ($9) - Huge prawns cooked perfectly! Sharmaji Ki Chaat ($6) - Really interesting contrast of taste and texture  Sekanjebin ($3) Dried Plums & Mint Cooler Masala Cola ($3.50) Sindhi Rabdi Falooda ($6)   We really enjoyed the food and the dining experience. Definitely coming back to try out other items on the menu next time when I am in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Today was the second time we attempted to try out this new restaurant. The menu looks great, decor is also really nice. Service was probably the worst I've ever experienced. The servers were very polite, but after waiting over 40 mins for nimbu pani and then plainly saying \"we misplaced your order\", polite is just not enough. Almost all the guests at the restaurant were staring anxiously at the food station hoping for their meal. A few started to get really upset with the staff as they were frantically trying to fix misplaced orders, etc. Being as hungry as we were, we just left without getting to try the food at all.  The nimbu pani was pretty decent though. But I don't think waiting over an hour is reasonable for any type of food."}
{"text":"Being a real Sindhi, I can honestly give this place a fair shake. The atmosphere that has been setup does remind one of the old days in the province of Sindh, with plenty of street carts and mobile food vendors. The menu are all authentic. They were well prepared just like one expected and served int he same fashion too! Very rich and filling, not to mention quite tasty too. As far as I know the only Sindhi food available in North America, so if in the area do visit. I also recommend the weekend specials."}
