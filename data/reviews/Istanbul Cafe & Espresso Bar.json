{"text":"The Istanbul cafe serves absolutely delicious lattes and cappuccinos.  It always has a friendly environment, I've come here to meet a friend many times.  It's also a great spot to read a book, and enjoy the nice weather over an excellent cup a joe."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant ambience. And to top it off the coffee just syncs in perfectly. Americanos in the morning are, almost, a daily adventure for me"}
{"text":"Good turkish coffee, and decent turkish delights and baklava. Cool interior. Makes for nice instagrams.
If you're looking for a pricey cafe that serves all your North American needs with a little twist, then this is your place. 
If you're looking for an authentic Turkish cafe, then I would probably not get your hopes up; this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Great Turkish coffee but the best is the rose lattee. Soooooo delicious that we drive from aurora for it!!!! Only complaint: it's sooooo hot in there. We went in a warmer day and couldn't sit inside for too long."}
{"text":"I have never been inside, but I certainly will be visiting after this morning. I was standing at the bus stop across the street, absolutely freezing, when a very lovely lady came by with steaming cups of Istanbul coffee and cookie samples and handed them out to everyone waiting in the cold. The coffee was delicious, and warm, and very welcome. What a kind, and genius, thing to do."}
{"text":"A cute cafe in midtown toronto! 
Though known for their turkish coffee, and london fog tea, I stuck with my traditional almond milk cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was!  the coffee had a nice aroma- not too bitter or sour and was a good ratio of coffee to almond milk (which i find alot of cafes have difficulty getting right!) 

The only negative I have is that this place is too popular! I came on an early tuesday afternoon and the place was packed by 4pm!. Students were huddling by the fireplace and sharing every corner of the couch since there were simply no more seats left.  Unfortunately because of the crowd, I had to leave earlier than anticipated since I had initially wanted to get some work done but couldn't with all the noise.  

I will try to come back to see if it is better atmosphere for working in the mornings- otherwise still a good cafe if you just want to stop by for a drink or to catch up with friends in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I am giving Istanbul Cafe 5 stars because it is by far my favourite cafe within a five minute walk of Yonge/Eglinton, so I want people to find out about it and support it, instead of people going to one of the absurd number of mediocre Starbucks that are in the area (only one out of six Starbucks I've been to in the area is an above average location in my experience).

If you are looking for somewhere other than a bar to go on a date in the area, this is a good place. If you order the tea or the Turkish coffee it can be a fun thing to do if you're interested in something different. It's also a good place to sit and do work during the day, but when it's nice out they open the front windows, so it can be a little noisy with all the traffic from Eglinton.

Most important for me is the interior: exposed brick on one side, nice wood flooring, wood tables and comfy leather chairs, a raised counter with stools if you prefer to work while standing, nice bathrooms (although small), cool/funky light fixtures, etc.

The staff are nice, and the woman I assume is the owner or manager is a common presence, which I see as a good thing (it shows she cares and is not focused on other things).

The wi-fi works really well. None of the Starbucks in the area have reliable wi-fi. I haven't been to Aroma enough to comment on that (I prefer the older Aroma location before the renovations in the Riocan building started).

I haven't had any food here because I generally don't eat sweets other than fresh fruit. I like how they serve the tea in a nice tea pot (although it's pricier than other places), and if you get the Turkish coffee they also present it beautifully (just don't be surprised that it comes in a shot glass sized cup).

I don't have a sophisticated palate, so I can't comment on the quality of the coffee."}
{"text":"Very ambient and cozy place to socialize with friends. I love how they use authentic turkish cups and servers when you order their tea and turkish coffee. I recommend the sweet pistachio baklava to be eaten with the bitter tea/coffee. Great experience, atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"A great new independent cafe in the Yonge and Eglinton area, where the neighborhood is over saturated with chain coffee shops. This place is celebrating its first anniversary and so far they have been able to succeed in their business . The staff and owner from Turkey are very friendly , it has a very nice cozy decoration and the ambiance is very relaxing . The prices compared to drink sizes are very reasonable. They sell a selection of beautiful Turkish handicraft , The place makes a variety of Espresso based drinks and they are pretty good at crafting it too. Do try their Flat white , Cortado , Cappuccino etc    Istanbul also carries various other tea drinks, a great selection of Turkish sweets and Turkish delight, and if you fancy Alcohol , that's on their menu too. Do try the Turkish Efes beer. If you are hungry , you can satisfy your hunger with different Turkish appetizers such as Borek, Turkish soup, stuffed grape leaves etc. overall , a great addition to the independent cafe scene in Toronto and especially the Eglinton area."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this cafe. Service is excellent and the seats are comfy. The pastries impressed me and since I had never had a Turkish coffee before, I was educated. I have to say it was quite different but I would definitely drink it again."}
{"text":"Love the interior design! Their turkish coffee is decent and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"Well what an experience this has been.  Quite a fine coffee indeed. A cozy crackling HD fire warms the back of the room. Try the Turkish coffee for an organic, rich and earthy experience presented on a regal tray with complimentary delights of Turkey presented on the side. A worthwhile experience. Perhaps you are so impressed with your coffee you decide to order another! You may find yourself looking for the washrooms. Not to worry the washrooms are fully stocked! and the women's washroom even includes a comfy chair to allow for a moment of rest. Your way will be lit by beautiful gourds hanging for the ceiling. So don't be shy, come on by for a wonderful cafe experience!"}
{"text":"This is like a second office to me... It has helped ease a lot of my forced \"wfh\" days. It has helped mend my relationship with my roommates because now I can safely spend time outside my apartment without having to run into them. Oh and the tea here is fantastic. I have yet to try their coffee but a big thumbs up for the tea. The decor reminds you of a lil tea shop in Istanbul.. I kid you not!!"}
{"text":"It's your local cozy cafe to catch up with old friends or a corner for yourself to hide from daily life! Their mango ice creams pretty delicious, my friend lived their Turk coffee. Feels like home :) it's not as small as it looks from outside, I was pretty surprised when I walked in"}
{"text":"Love the lattes here. The flavour of the coffee is comforting and delightful, unlike most other cafes where they end up overheating the milk or the espresso or both! Being a hard to please coffee enthusiast, i've tried coffee in many places around town and this surely tops the charts for me. So glad to be in the neighbourhood! I've only dropped a star for the price as even a small latte here can cost close to $5."}
{"text":"If you ever wonna try a very good and authentic Turkish coffee you got the right spot! The decor is fabulous, staff are nice. The only thing is that it is a bit expensive and you need to be prepared to be packed cause when you seat there, you don't wonna leave!"}
{"text":"So happy thia place opened up.  The area was in need of an independent coffee house.   Beautiful decor, incredibly nice staff, authentic menu, clean bathrooms... what more could you want?  They even have almond milk!  I'm happy to be a regular here."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere is lovely, there are tons of outlets and work space, the baristas are friendly, and the lattes are delish.  There isn't a lot of food choices available, but I do recommend the quinoa cranberry muffin.  The presentation with the traditional Turkish coffee is beautiful."}
{"text":"Good coffee and sweet. The only problem is the super high price on everything. Other than that it's nice place to chill with friends and have some Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Istanbul Café is located 3 min walk from Yonge and Eglinton Subway. The entrance is small, but inside is not so small. There are comfortable seats and tables. It is cozy and relaxing. It is a cool place.  The latte is very tasty. There are many kinds of people. Business people are discussing businesses, young professionals are working on their business, women are chatting with their friends, and high school students are eating their lunch their mom makes. I am so happy to find a café I can relax and read a book."}
{"text":"Love their coffee 
The place is very cozy and comfortable, but time to time they dint have any available space, because people come to work there instead enjoy atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place!  Friendly staff and super clean and lots of character!  Stop in to meet with a client or grab a quick drink.  Only suggestion would be that they need to get a signature drink.  It is also not wheelchair accessible.  I ordered a hazelnut latte, and it was amazing! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best service, fresh coffee which is to die for, and excellent Vegan and Gluten Free energy bars which are truly divine. Quiet spot to do work on a computer if you'd like, read a book, have a coffee date at the front on a couch!!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for the past three years as I work near Davisville. During my midday quests for comfy cafés this has become an ultimate fave. It has awesome variwty if you're looking for a spin on your average cup of joe. Obviously you have to get that Turkiah coffee experience because you really capture the entire atmosphere this cafe provides. Warmth, comfort and a hint of sweetness with that bit of Turkish delight they give you. Also their cortados are made beautifully and taste so good no sugar is ever required. Love coming here to read because the music is never too loud."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I'm in love. The coffee is really good. The ambience is also just perfect. It's rare to find a cafe open late around Yonge/Eglinton so that is a plus. If I could make a request, can you sell rice pudding?"}
{"text":"I was \"kid free\" this morning and decided to try something different so I came to Istanbul Cafe & Espresso Bar.  The place is very trendy with lots of energy.  Although I'm getting to an age when ANY group of people under 30 years old are \"hip\" in my book. 

I decided to try the Turkish Coffee from the menu (you know, when in Rome....) and the hazelnut pastry.  Now, in my experience, bad Turkish coffee can taste like tar but good ones are fabulous.  I'm glad to say it's the latter in this case.  The presentation is excellent and to my delight the coffee was served with a Turkish Delight - pun intended. The coffee felt velvety and rich and the crema had a rich gold colour to it.  At the end of the last sip you saw the coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup - where is a fortune teller when you need one?

The hazelnut pastry was amazing.  Very fresh, moist and tasty.  

The servers were helpful and friendly, although I got the impression the average tenure isn't very long.  

The coffee and pastry came to about $10 which is on par with most other places. And frankly given the higher level of labour effort required for the Turkish coffee one would expect it to cost more than an Americano. 

Even though I'm not a big tea drinker, I can't wait to come back here again and try their tea.  The presentation looks great!

All and all, I highly recommend this place next time you want something different than the usual caffeine drink. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Istanbul is a pretty new cafe in the Yonge and Eglinton area. The atmosphere is very cozy - it kind of feels like you're at someone's house. I had the pistachio baklava, Turkish tea (which is kind of like an Early Grey) and my friend had the cappacino. She didn't like it but I actually did because it wasn't sweet (though I'll admit, it didn't taste like they used regular espresso - make Turkish espresso?) and the cream was shaped in a cute heart. Most people in the cafe ordered the Turkish tea, it comes in a traditional tea pot with a cute little cup. They also have some Turkish food, one of them is a flakey pastry with cheese and it smells soooo good. I think I found my new weekend hub :)"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I felt a bit wrong going to a Turkish place and not trying the Turkish coffee... But I loved the Turkish desserts I tried. Both the walnut baklava as well as the hazelnut sekerpare were really tasty! Sweet but not too sweet. They probably go better with a Turkish coffee than with the Chai latte that I ordered. The tea was OK. For a chai tea I felt it lacked some spiciness. 
The ambience/decoration of the cafe was really nice. A bit dark, but it gives the place a slightly mysterious ambience. There was a real fireplace as well as the fireplace channel playing on the one tv at the back of the cafe which also gave it a nice vibe on a cold-ish November evening. 
Honestly, this would be a 5-star in my books except that both the tea and snacks were a bit on the expensive side, in my opinion. I guess ~$5 for a large tea isn't that crazy compared to something like Starbucks, but in my head that just seems like way too much. The desserts were also quite small for their price. Anyhow, a nice cafe that I would return to in the future."}
{"text":"I loved the coffee service that the Turkish coffee comes in. Beautiful. Such a unique experience. I decided to go crazy and buy a Turkish coffee pot to take with me. $30 for the pot. Last week I visited Marche Istanbul on Dufferin near the Yorkdale Mall and saw the same pot, same size pot for $10."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Great ambience! Rustic, yet cozy, decor with various types of seating. Lots of people socializing and lots of people working. A comfortable place to go with friends as well as solo.

They offer a interesting variety of housemade Turkish pastries and drinks. The coffee is fantastic. I didn't try any of the pastries, but I wish I had! They also serve local beer! Pricing is good, staff are also good. 

Just a cool place to hang. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I regularly make Turkish coffee at home, so I was very excited to try theirs. The interior is kind of dark and dim with some beautiful hand-painted souvenirs (for sale) juxtaposed with modern seating and even a fireplace. There is even a little patio out front which is cute. They also have some traditional turkish desserts like sekerpare and baklava as well as regular coffee beverages.

I would say the presentation of the Turkish coffee was the best part of my experience and what brought me there in the first place; it came in a beautiful shiny silver tray with a side of mini Turkish delights (llokum). Traditional Turkish coffee is thick with sediment at the bottom but this one had too much sediment throughout and to me it felt like a waste of $4. The turkish delights were good. I would come back and try one of their regular lattes next time."}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe by Yonge/Eglinton. The Turkish coffee is their headliner. For about $4 you get a little cup of aromatic Turkish caffeine goodness, and some tasty turkish delights! 

However, their chocolate chip cookie and turkish cake were a bit disappointing. 

The space has a few tables and several comfortable couches. The owner is nice and attentive. However, you might need to park a few blocks down as there are not a lot of parking spaces nearby!"}
{"text":"Amazing tea and matcha latte.

Atmosphere is great.

Friendly staff.

Nice long tables, perfect to work on your laptop and lots of plugs.

I wish they closed later than 9 - 10.

Food is overpriced."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely new spot for me. Didn't know they exist until a friend invited me for a cup of coffee to this cafe. 
The decoration of the place, the set up, the decorated serving cups/trays - makes you feel as though you are in Turkey.
I loved the vibe.

Easily very busy and hard to get these comfy couches next to the window. 

Loved my turkish coffee experience. The turkish delights that come with it are delicious (probably best I tired so far). And it all comes for just $4

I am definitely coming back with more friends. I hope they have a small patio kicking in the summer months."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times over the past year. The atmosphere is unlike any other cafe I've visited in the city, warm and inviting with an eclectic array of decor. It does get busy on weekends but there's always plenty of seating to choose from. Although I usually like to go with a cappuccino or latte, there are a lot of other options on the menu like Turkish coffees, teas and even light snacks and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy coffee spot with turkish accent. Tried latte and turkish coffee - both very good!"}
{"text":"Ambience is nice and cozy, the Turkish coffee and tea also nice. The great thing about it is that it's open late hours, something you can't find easily in Toronto. The location is small, however; if not lucky enough to get a seat it might take very long before somebody leaves. If you drive you will find it difficult to find a parking spot close. Overall I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Istanbul Cafe is probably the best cafe I've been to in Toronto. It has a great, relaxing atmosphere and some very skilled baristas."}
{"text":"I came here at night once. It was not a good idea, but for good reasons.
The reason being, I ordered Turkish Coffee, which is strong like no tomorrow. I drank it at 9 PM, and didn't sleep until 5 AM the following morning. Had I known it would be so strong, I'd have had it at 9 AM instead. Very bitter, but very strong. Obviously not meant to chug down like a regular drink.

The desserts were great! Small treats for everyone to try which were great because it really introduced me to Turkish cuisine and gave me something to look forward to again!

The ambiance was great, the place is comfortable and has an inviting atmosphere. It makes you want to be there and stay there, as if you're at a relative's house. I loved that part - it was comfortable and really nice to be there. Definitely a good outing or date spot."}
{"text":"What a great cafe and amazing coffee. Haven't had coffee like this since the last time I was in Turkey. 

The staff is friendly and clean"}
{"text":"It's a cozy place to hang out and have Turkish coffee. The decor reminded me of my trip to Turkey. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a girl friend of mine on Jan. 15 and it's a cute little coffee shop. Great place if you want to have a nice chat with a friend and enjoy Turkish Coffee. Not much seating though.. ackward set up for seats.  They should have more 2 seater tables instead of 4 or groups- makes it ackward to sit down literally right beside 2 strangers and try to have a conversation at the same time.  Cost is a bit pricier."}
{"text":"A really awesome place to get work done. Extremely spacious with lots of seating. Quiet atmosphere. They have a real fire place and they also play the fireplace channel on TV. They have couches, long work benches and chairs w/ tables.

 I ordered an almond (milk) latte and it was average. However, I do come in for ice lattes and they are always great. 

Service is average.

This is definitely not a place to go to if you want cheap coffee. But I think their price is still average when compared to other cafes.

Gonna come again to try their Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"I found this cafe while exploring the city not too long ago and was please try surprised! The customer service was great! I ordered Rose Latté and I have to term you all that if you visit it, definitely give it a shot, you  will pleasantly surprised how well the rose and espresso flavors compliment one another!  They also offer skim milk. There's free wifi, plenty of seating and outlets along the wall for everyone to keep charging their devices! All in all very pleased and will go back again to try other beverages and get some work done in the future. 

I took one star away because it does tend to get crowded in late afternoon and although the lamps over the tables are very pretty, I think they hang a bit too low..it was a struggle to brush past the two ladies sitting at a neighboring table and also not hit my head against the lamp at the same time."}
{"text":"One of the best cafes to get work done in my opinion. There are plenty of outlets and couches! I also love the fact that Istanbul Cafe is a hidden gem - the less people, the more space to get work done and more outlets available! 

I had the signature traditional Turkish coffee (that came along in this beautiful silver ornate set complete with tray and Turkish delights), the cheese lasagna (I forgot the proper name for the dish), the walnut baklava and the pistachio baklava. The coffee was thick in texture, was very strong and definitely helped to give me that much needed boost of energy. The Turkish delights were delicious and balanced out the richness of the coffee. There was about a two centimetre layer of sediment leftover from the coffee though but then again, I guess that is to be expected from drinking from a tiny coffee mug. The cheese lasagna was really good as well although it could have been much better had it been warmed up longer. The baklavas were really good! I especially enjoyed the pistachio baklava. Overall, a really good late lunch. 

The interior of Istanbul Cafe is very cozy - lots of couches and chairs and pillows. There's lots of beautiful gourd lamps hanging above the tables, colourful Turkish ceramics, and gorgeous photos (presumably photos taken from Turkey) mounted on the walls. Not only is it very distinct in their decor and menu but they also have stuffed toys, dolls, books, dictionaries and board games - very accommodating towards the various types of customers that walk into the cafe. The staff were really nice and friendly. Bathrooms were very clean and even had cushioned chairs in them! 

Overall rating? 4.5 stars out of 5 (but I'll just give them a 5 for the time being!). I definitely want to come back to Istanbul Cafe again. I'm really down for trying out their lattes (baristas got some really good skills with the latte art at Istanbul) and more of their homemade pastries."}
{"text":"I can see why this place is packed: delicious drinks, delectable food surrounded by beautiful, exotic decor.

Staff are pleasant and helpful, willing to explain their offerings and offer recommendations according to your tastes.

Chose a pulled pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, London Fog tea and a slice of Revani cake (classic Turkish sponge cake steeped in syrup, flavored with orange zest and topped with coconut flakes).

OH WOW! Everything was flavorful and oh-so- satisfying. The sandwiches had tender meat with savoury sauces that were contained nicely by thick, fluffy slices of bread. Good thing the cashier warned me that the cake was sweet, I ate a little bit of it at a time and washed it down with my delicious tea; the cake  would go perfect with their Turkish coffee. 

Met the lovely owner and inquired about the gorgeous hanging gourd lights; she said that they came all the way from Turkey. The artist must have had lots of patience and time to carve out the intricate designs; you have to see them in person to truly appreciate the artistry in each piece.

I would suggest to come at non-peak times so you have a better chance of snagging a table. This is the kind of place you need to sit down, relax and take your time in soaking in the ambiance."}
{"text":"Very cozy place.  Good service, excellent Turkish tea and really good atmosphere.  I didn't like the Turkish coffee, but somebody in my table said that was good.  They have a lot of table games, music and some tipycall desserts."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come here and spill all your juicy dirty secrets with your friends as the dark ambiance of the place just lends itself perfectly for that!  An excellent first date place as the soft lighting provides the perfect airbrushed look and just soften your features and gives you that amazing glow - b/c seriously who doesn't want to look all gorgeous in front of a date?!

This place really reminds me of my time in Istanbul - the decor, some of the food items (although kinda expensive...but it's yonge/eg area - what do you expect?) the turkish coffees/teas.  They also have whiskeys and wines if that's more your style.

It's a small place with maybe seating for about 15-20 people...mostly tables..but a small couch and some comfy chairs as well.  There is one long communal table that provides for great conversations with strangers.

Went here on a Saturday night and in the later part of the evening they have live music - last night a guitarist and a flutist who were playing/singing.  

I would definitely go back..in fact i might start calling this my place!"}
{"text":"A lovely cafe that is well thought out and cozy, a perfect respite from whatever blistering cold weather Toronto is enduring for the day. There are three sofa/armchair areas, a handful of small two-person tables in the back, and a long communal table off to one side. If you are lucky, you can snag the coveted leather armchairs right in front of the fireplace. Also, there are conveniently placed outlets to plug in your electrical device of choice.... always very important.

The drinks are prepared with attention and care from the staff, and everyone seems to enjoy the Turkish coffee which comes on a fancy silver platter set. The only drawback was that their wifi was sporadic. It would be fine on my phone but dead on my laptop."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you are in the area you can stop by for coffee or dessert.  We tried different things and everything was just awesome. Above all the ambiance of the place is beautiful. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"It's a nice, quaint cafe that does remind me a little of Istanbul with portraits of every day life in Turkey on the walls, the warm lighting, and tea cups. I love coming here to work. And the service is always great. A very relaxed environment and they gave a shelf if books on the back wall too. It's a nice place to be by yourself or with some company and lounge in the middle on the arm chairs or sofa."}
{"text":"Awesome people awesome coffee. Great customer service. Beautiful ambiance and love the presentation."}
{"text":"I often come here in the mornings to grab coffee and a croissant/muffin before work. The staff is always friendly and efficient. The latte art is usually simple, but always makes for a great photo. 

I absolutely love the vibe -- it's eclectic and kind of hipster with a fake fireplace, book shelves and big comfy chairs. 

There are lots of two-person tables and one long table for a group or a bunch of people working on laptops. 

The coffee shop also offers alcoholic drink options, if you're looking to have a casual drink in the evening."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Starbucks, but sometimes you want variety when going out for coffee/tea. My friend and I decided to go to Istanbul Cafe & Espresso Bar for a gab session over caffeine (thanks to Yelp). I was a few minutes late to meet my friend, but she texted me to let me know that there was nowhere to sit. Thankfully by the time arrived, a group cleared out and we were able to snag the seats by the fireplace. This is a great place to sit and relax; it feels so cozy with dark lighting a comfortable chairs all around. Espresso drinks come with latte art and teas come in a cute pot - I really dig the presentation of the drink items here. I already had lunch, but the food looked quite good as well. I can't wait to come back.

Some additional pros: open late, free WiFi, alcohol

Good for: coffee, tea, drinks, getting work done"}
{"text":"Great turkish coffee, and decent turkish delight. Cool interior. However it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy coming here. Twice I've been here and ordered the Turkish Coffee. It comes in a silver coffee tray set. It's the size of an espresso cup but its flavour is not as strong. It's somewhere between a coffee and an espresso, if that makes sense. It often takes 10-15 mins for them to make this due to the brewing process. The coffee comes with two pieces of (pistachio?) Turkish delights which is a nice treat. There are regulars that come here who are really friendly and welcoming. I discovered this because I decided to sip my coffee while putting away my earphones & phone. I guess that made me a more approachable stranger. It was a good morning!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good chai latte all over town. For non-coffee drinkers it's very hard to find anything else than regular tea in the coffee shops. I've had Starbucks chai latte on several occasions but find it very sweet. My friend recommended Istanbul cafe and specifically their chai latte and once I tried it I was hooked! This is by far the best chai latte I've ever had. It's packed with sweet spices like cardamom and cinnamon, and is lightly sweetened to enhance the flavour of the spices. This has now become my number one favourite coffee shop! Since I discovered this place about a month ago I've been here several times. It's definitely worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Interesting cafe I thought to try. It was a fun adventure in food and definitely worth checking out. The espresso was super strong, and quite unique in flavour! The baklava is very well done too. Good seating and decor. No qualms about coming back, except that this isn't usually my palate."}
{"text":"So cute! They have nice lamps and the coffee tasted so nice--they give you two pieces of Turkish delight with your coffee so although I ordered another dessert it wasn't really necessary as the Turkish delights were already sweet. The atmosphere is so cozy at night and there's a fake fireplace at the back with some neat chairs and tables."}
{"text":"Around my area, the extent of coffee shops are limited to Starbucks and Tim Hortons, and to get something as unique and delicious as Istanbul Café & Espresso Bar is a real treat! I've made this my staple coffee place and have tried to pry the starbucks from my friends hands and walk them a couple of blocks up to this gem. And its open super late!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy place. I liked the warm fireplace and it was interesting to try Turkish coffee. Much preferred the delicious tea though. Great for a first date."}
{"text":"I will likely go back to Istanbul cafe although I was slightly disappointed by my first experience. While the atmosphere of the place rocked my socks off, the Turkish coffee was watered down and not as flavorful as the ones I've had back home, the cake was really good but a very small portion, and the chicken sandwich my friend had did not meet expectations given the $11 pricetag. I will try a latte next time with hopes that it's something to come back for. Until then, I'm giving this cozy cafe a solid 3/5."}
{"text":"Good coffee.  Avoid the pastries.  I found mould on there coconut chocolate bar.  At first the server/barista told me it was coconut but sorry coconut flakes are not shaped round and sitting on the side of a cake."}
{"text":"When people in the order line behind you are saying oooooo ahhhhh, while you are making your food selection, you know that you are not in a Price is Right episode.. You are at Istanbul Cafe!!!

All I have to say is get, try, savour the Pistachio Sekarpare....it's the softest cookie with all the right Turkish yuminess and it's only $2.99. We ordered a Turkish coffee and an Almond milk latte as well and the Hot drinks were also delicious! With the grand total of $12.99 with tax, this place is as close as one will get to experiencing authentic ambiance and flavours of the Türk kahvesi in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Under staff. Noe ones here to serve you. They dont have breakfast or brunch on a sunday 1pm. The lady in the kitchen is asian and not familiar with Turkish dishes or even the food they serve. The Turkish coffee tastes good but the tea set is not much appropriate for a hot beverage like this one. Over priced and under service. I also ordered a spinach borek which she put it in the microwave and killed all the crunchiness. The place look nice but not worth driving here or even bringing anyone special."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chai tea and apple cider are delicious. It is quiet enough to work, but loud enough to allow you some privacy if you need to make a phone call. The food is great. I would only love to see my favorite desserts every time I visit."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a place like this opened in the area! Despite all the condos and \"young & eligible\" moniker, this stretch of eglinton east has a serious shortage of cozy independent cafes open late. Istanbul Cafe is a perfect edition to the neighbourhood! 

In my experience, the drinks have always been well-made and delicious (and are around the same prices as you'd find in starbucks/ second cup). The baristas are always friendly. They also have a good selection of reasonably priced snacks and sandwiches. It's not a huge place but I really like the large communal table in the back. Its great for working and there are plenty of outlets located along the wall behind it. The ambiance is very cozy (soft dim lighting...its a bit dark in the back) and casual with turkish inspired decor. Overall, I really like this place and I plan on being a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times it's been great- both atmosphere and coffee! Ordered a cappuccino the first time and it even came with a beautiful latte art, and the second time got a macchiatto/cortado and the espresso was delicious. Staff are friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Loves it! I highly recommend this place for some real Turkish coffee. A lot better than big corporation coffee places. The de'cor is amazing and they even sell handmade mugs, saucers, and other Turkish stuffs. They're also licensed to sell alcohol."}
{"text":"I came here to study, cause I'm tired of the busy Starbucks and the library was too cold. Annnnnd to enjoy a Turkish coffee. I can't lie, I'm mesmerized by lights and anything decorative in a cafe, and it's part of the reason I also came. I tried Spinach Borek with a Turkish coffee. I think the Borek was very so so and so was the Turkish coffee. But the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is the environment. They turned down the lights after 8 pm and put candles on each table and created a more romantic atmosphere. My friend came and didn't want to order anything and just accompanied me there and we were never kicked out based on the number of hours spent there. Very nice staff :) I would come back and try what others were having (big mugs of regular coffee perhaps)"}
{"text":"delicious place and unique. had a few of their pastries and their turkish coffee ."}
{"text":"I do like their coffee.  It's smell so good when u walk inside the shop. Latte looks like regular coffee but it's tasted very good. Turkish coffee, fresh make.  I love the coffee are fresh made"}
{"text":"I love this place so very much! So sad to be discovering it when I'll be leaving the area. 

Amazing coffee (lattes and Americanos in my experience)

Really like their chocolate chip cookie. Some of the Turkish treats are extremely sweet but if you are looking for that, quite a few authentic choices are available to you. 

Lots of seating, from a small patio, to leather lounging and communal work tables in the back. 

Even the bathroom is cute and clean. 
And the service is wonderful to boot.

Can't say enough about this cafe. Neighborhood gem! 

All that's missing is some hookah and a larger patio to make this my second home... That and the fact that they don't have their music game together. Baristas/Owners should really look into that and either expose clientele to Turkish music or play safe/soothing coffee shop jams. 

I Recommend- The lattes. Smooth and silky with lovely art 

Extra Tip- if you live nearby, grab a loyalty card. Every tenth coffee is free!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty cool, as it was my first time going to a Turkish cafe. There is some really unique/ethnic decor here which I loved... colourful stained glass lamps and some painted ceramic plates hanging on the wall. I didn't order anything special, just a chai latte which I thought was oddly sweet... do they use a different type of cinnamon here? It lacked that slight bitter/spice taste and was just... sweet and overly milky. I still thought it was enjoyable enough, but just threw me off guard. My friend ordered the Turkish coffee and it came on this beautiful little silver tray with a tiny platter of turkish delights on them. I've never had Turkish coffee before so I tried some... super dark and rich and bitter, and also with a bit of a gritty texture due to the grinds floating in it. Not really my thing, but the presentation was lovely. I noticed some other patrons had ordered tea and it came in these beautiful little clay teapots. Overall I enjoyed my time here and loved the overall look of this place - I love that it's different from your usual basic Starbucks, and it felt super cozy. If I was in this area more often then I would come here to study or just chill."}
{"text":"This place is really well designed, laid out and aesthetically pleasing. 
Really nice ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I want to keep all to myself but you just need to hear about it! Everything about this place shows thoughtfulness and care from the decor to the treats and not to forget the phenomenal cappuccino!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a long time with my girlfriend and finally we made it. The inside is spacious and there's lots of  tables, chairs and even a few couches. There was also a chess board at one of the couches. Now to the food/drinks. I wasn't really impressed. Prices are a bit high and the baklava was just decent and pretty typical. The Turkish coffee was a first for me so I don't really have anything to compare it to but it was not my thing. Very dark and bitter and you get few sweet cubes and water to chase it with. I enjoyed trying it once but probably wouldn't again."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The ambiance is lovely, the coffee quite good, perfect when paired with the revani cake!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this place and I loved it . I'm not a coffee person but I've been going there for Turkish coffee and their amazing baklava many times since then . 
It just has a nice vibe to it . The only downside is the ever lasting construction going on outside right in front of it . Well it's Eglinton , what else can we expect ?"}
{"text":"Really really overpriced. I wouldn't recommend getting any of the food items.. 10$ for a sandwich they heat up in their microwave and have paper sticking to. Their drinks (Americano, cold brew, Turkish..) are delicious, but do yourself and your wallet a favour and don't buy the food"}
{"text":"Excellent cafe. Staff are friendly, coffee is great, decor is nice. Just had a cappuccino and a piece of baklava which were good."}
{"text":"I walked pass this cafe multiple times and had been meaning to go in. I went once...never again. Yes, the atmosphere is very middle eastern and very cool looking but my drink was atrocious. I was feeling a beverage with matcha, so the barista suggested their version of a \"frappuccino\"  and I said sure why not! As I ordered the matcha beverage I asked for it to either be made with skim, or non-fat milk and no extra added syrup for sweetening. She said sure, and I got pretty excited! I got my drink, thanked the barista and left. Upon stepping out of the store I took a sip and wanted to spit it out. Not only did she not use skim or non-fat milk, she used CREAM, in addition to what I can  assumed was a full cup of  sweetening syrup into it as well. Not only could I not drink what I bought.. but honestly it was a complete waste of matcha."}
