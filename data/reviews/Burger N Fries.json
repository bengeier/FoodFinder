{"text":"This place is bad. Doors open in June. 90 degrees inside. 20 minutes to get mini burger that wasn't good.  Batter on onion rings is terrible."}
{"text":"I love their menu. Staff are always friendly and inviting. Great food! Very cool stop to come by and relax and have a great burger. The shakes are awesome too! Been there multiple times in the last few months, and as person in the health industry it's the perfect cheat meal! :-)
Valerie is awesome by the way!
If you haven't been you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Food is pricy and not so good. Place is clean but lacks personality. We were the only people in the place and it felt like we were putting them out. One and done. 2 stars for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Pros: The people were very nice and the place looked clean. And it's a great location. My order was ready quickly and the flavor of the burger was good.
Cons: I was surprised at how small the burger was, and they should have been more generous with the toppings. There also weren't many fries and they were greasy and the smaller ones were burnt. I got the All American with added grilled onions, fries and a drink and the total was around $13. I appreciate that the meat is healthier, but it's just too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Really good burger and fries. I thought the burger was a little small, but very good. I got a sample of the seasonal beer before committing. I really liked it as well. Service was excellent. The young woman at the checkout checked on us later to make sure everything was good.  I will probably be back."}
{"text":"I recently went to burger n fries again and tried their veggie burger. It was phenomenal. It was made fresh and from their home made recipe, it's like nothing I've ever had. I defiantly suggest trying it!"}
{"text":"First time in and I will say the staff was friendly and the 'shroom burger was really tasty.  However, that is probably the smallest burger I have had at any casual dining restaurant.  Also, I added avocado and there were 2 little slivers added to the burger.  Not enough, in my opinion for the added charge.  Again, very tasty, but for the price, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Better than HopDoddy, better than Five Guys... this is a fantastic burger! The taste of the meat is so delicious. Very cool decor and \"green\" company philosophy. Fabulous frozen custard milkshakes and excellent fries that appear to be hand-cut. 

Run to this place... they are also open late, which I love!"}
{"text":"The burgers are made with grass fed beef and are really tasty.  The shakes and other ice cream drinks are made fresh and you have numerous choices for add ins.  The burgers are delivered to your table hot and fresh and the employees (especially Carla) are very friendly and considerate. 

There is also a \"big a**\" fan in the dining room which creates a nice breeze especially during Arizona summers."}
{"text":"WOW! This was the first time my husband and I have been here! All I can say is we WILL DEFINITELY be back! The service was absolutely amazing!! The young lady greeted us right as we walked in and offered to answer any questions we may have! She was super friendly and nice. After we placed our order I remembered I should of asked for cheese, my husband went up and asked if we could add that on or if it was too late! They were MORE than happy to do so!! The food was very good and tasted delicious! While we were eating she came over and checked to see if we needed anything, and asked how the food was! It was a great experience and because of the service alone we will be back she did an awesome job!! The food being so good is just a bonus, it's hard to find both!"}
{"text":"I had the \"All American\" burger and onion rings and it was all delicious. The onion rings had a nice batter to them. The wait time was short, staff friendly, and bathrooms where clean."}
{"text":"We had a most enjoyable meal!  The staff was pleasant and the service was prompt. The burgers, fries, and onion rings were hands down the best we have had in the area and in quite some time, and the portions were over the top in generosity. I will definitely be back! Kudos to the management and staff!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice environment and good service. I like that they use chairs made from all recycled material. The cheeseburger is very tasty. The buns that they use are soft and delicious. They have about every option for beverage you can imagine. The only draw back is that the burgers are very small (about four big bites)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

This is a cool new place with a fast casual vibe. Restaurant has a modern relaxed feel. Good weekend lunch spot. 

They get their beef from creekstone farms so its halal! YES!!!

Its all natural and the burger dosen't give you that greasy feeling you get after eating other burgers.

It tastes like a high quality burger. The meat has a really high quality taste. Theres a bunch of topping options so you can personalize it. 

It had the shroom burger with jalape√±os and their special cheese sauce. It was great! The only thing was that it was a little on the small side.

You can get the fries with different types of seasonings. I had regular and cajun. They were OK not super amazing.

Overall I really liked this place and plan on returning!

----------------------

Went back and this time got the double and added BBQ sauce - Amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Scottsdale by a big margin.  Great location and super friendly staff.  Crushes cheeseburgers and cold beer and smashburger."}
{"text":"Should be called \"Mini Burger n'Fries\". Food was good but the burger was like mini sized. A little bigger than some sliders. Price is standard for a quality burger. I was surprised the burger was so small."}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Big Burger and Onion Rings. The burger was 8oz of black angus beef really well seasoned and the cheese melted right into it. Had a couple of strips of bacon, some lettuce and tomato. It also had their BURGERnFRIES sauce which it was really good. The onion rings were out of this world. They batter them fresh to order. Actually the cashier told me that everything is fresh and nothing is frozen, that their meat is never frozen and that their fries are fresh cut there.

They have a good selection of beers and craft beers. Their wines look good and really good prices. I had a Scottsdale Blonde, awesome beer!

They also hhave custards with a lot of toppings to choose from.. but I was full, maybe for next time."}
{"text":"Good food, fair price, excellent service, nice place to sit outside for a peaceful lunch."}
{"text":"This burger place hits the spot so bad! I live in Orange County, CA and travel a lot due to the nature of my work. I was in Scottsdale last week for a few days and stayed at a hotel across the area. I drove by it a few times before my appetite kicked in.

\"Wooooow\" is all that I kept saying the whole time I was there. The automatic sliding doors are so unique!! That and the string of lights from the roof definitely gives it a more upscale \"hip\" vibe. When I walked in I was charmed at the menu and how it was printed on a mirror. I read reviews below me and seriously can't believe that people could not read it. I had NO problem reading the menu. The decor in general is VERY appealing and unique. Oh, and I LOVE the recycled cocacola chairs. For the record I am an artist, so I notice really really small details and it's those details that puts this burger joint in another league. Very impressed.

Moving on to the reason I am writing this review, their all natural grass-fed burgers. As my first time, the young lady at the register guided me through the menu and recommended the All American. With a fried egg. And bacon. And fries please. FOUR MINUTES LATER (it was really that fast) my burger came out on a silver platter that it so righteously deserved to be on.

I was so impressed by the presentation of the burger. I will post pictures so you can see for yourself! I had fries first and MY GOODNESS how delicious were they. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Genius!! 

The burger was next and WOW it was increeeddibleeee!! The toasty bun, the smokey rich patty, maple bacon, fried egg, etc etc it was nothing short from perfection!! 
It tastes very upscale for the price. You get way more than you pay for. 

This place has such a great atmosphere and quality product. That burger really did leave a big impression on me and for that reason they deserve an honest review. Thank you and I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Burgers we're super! Onion rings were really delicous. We were really hungry after a long day of driving to the Canyon.

This place did not disappoint !! The staff was friendly and very efficient, service was fast.
The place was roomy and very clean."}
{"text":"I love the layout of this restaurant. The doors can fully open to allow fresh air in during the cool months or stay closed while still allowing sun through the windows during warm months. As you walk in, the menu presents itself high enough so everyone in line can see. Mirrors reflect the walls in front making the room look even bigger. 
The burgers are absolutely fabulous!! They were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of juice left in them. 
You can easily take your burger to go and eat in the car. My to go order was completed promptly. 
Employees are very friendly and always have a smile on their face. They work hard to make sure you get exactly what you want. 
I would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out since it is close to where I work.  The first thing I noticed is it was pretty empty which I thought it was odd since it was lunch now I know why.  After walking up to the counter I waited for 5 minutes and no one bothered to greet me there was an employee standing there not 5 feet from me and never said a thing.  So I left and I won't bother ever trying that place again.  If you can't provide basic service then I can't provide my hard earned money."}
{"text":"The burgers were great, as were the fries.
I liked the atmosphere, very open and airy. The staff were all nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Wow, fantastic meal. The burger was super good. You could tell the meat was very good quality. It's good to see a burger place value the quality of their product so much. This was my first time here so ordered the all American. Looking forward to trying their other option on the menu. Plus the staff was very polite. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!

Stopped by this past weekend, and received the most incredible customer service from the girl that was working there. Found that the menu had everything we wanted and the employee that helped us brought our food out and even engaged in conversation about her favorite sauces and menu favorites.

The food was incredible. Tasted fresh and delicious! I love my burgers and this business is top notch! Highly recommend this restaurant for food or just to hang out in the cool, open and breezy atmosphere they provide!"}
{"text":"This was a real mixed bag.  The young lady behind the register was extremely friendly and helpful.  I ordered an All American (double), small onion rings, and a fountain drink.  The bill was almost $15.00!
I took my cup to the pop machine, out of Diet Coke.  Luckily there's two machines so I just moved to the other one.  Woops, also no Diet Coke.  I asked at the register if they had another machine behind the counter and someone came right out to fix it.
When the food arrived my first thought was, I'm sure glad I ordered a double.  The second was, those onion rings sure look well done.
The burger was on a bun that looked like the discount brand you see at the grocery.  The burgers were very thin, kind of crispy around the edges and had a very good flavor.  The meat was the highlight and I'd come back for it except for the rest of the experience.
After the food was in front of me for a few seconds, I realized the problem with the onion rings wasn't that they were well done when I got a whiff of old fryer grease.  For some stupid reason, I tried one and it tasted of rancid grease.  I think these would be above average onion rings otherwise.
The young lady from the register came thru the dining room when I was about done asking how things were.  I told her about the onion rings and she offered to bring me something else or take them off my bill.  I went with the refund.
Bottom line: great customer service, great beef patties, my stomach is gurgling from the onion rings.  There's much better options for less money in my opinion."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the \"Big Big Burger\" and a create your own chocolate custard with brownies, marshmallow, whipped cream and oreo cookies. 

The burger was cooked and in my hands within 10 minutes of ordering it.The difference in the burger between any other place and this place is that Burger N Fries makes theirs from all natural grass fed beef. In case your wondering, you can taste a difference. Instead of having no taste and being overcooked, the burgers served here are full of juice and are perfectly cooked. 

The custard ice cream was quite the shake! 

I was happy to see that the restaurant including the bathrooms were VERY clean. This is something this restaurant does extremely well. 

The service was pretty good. I think they could improve a little on more interactions with the customers. For example, it would be good to greet the customer when he/she enters the restaurant and leaves. The water cups were pretty small. I would like to see them make the change to a larger cup so that the customer doesn't have to get up and refill their drink after every 3-4 sips. 

Other than that, they have made some improvements since the last time I visited. Keep up the hard work."}
{"text":"No nonsense burger & fry counter service joint.  Awesome burgers, tasty fries, and even tastier shakes.  Reasonable pricing, and quick, friendly service.   They have lots of \"green\" initiatives in place and that makes me happy!"}
{"text":"For a burger on a grill, this is as good as it gets.  They adorn the burger with an excellent bacon with a rich smokey flavor that pushes this burger over the top.  The fries are blanch fried first and then finished.  These guys do everything right.  Hey, I can also get my favorite:  Lime Diet Coke!  LOL!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday at 5:30 PM and was the only customer there. Food was clean but overall very disappointing. I think they are trying to model themselves after Smashburger. I ordered the \"Big Big Burger\" and a medium onion rings. The burger was just okay, but nothing special. The onion rings looked terrific, but were flavorless and had an odd mushy texture. I spent most of the meal trying to figure out what they used for breading that came out so weird. Maybe pancake batter? 

I could tell the staff was trying hard to please, but the food was very disappointing. The owners need to go back and rethink the menu and recipes completely. I'm not planning to return."}
{"text":"I normally visit fast food places for burgers just because of its easy however every once and a while I splurge for a nice one. I tried this place tonight with a roommate and the burgers were really good. Not the absolute best I have ever had but probably on par with the juiciest. The mAnager greeted us and service was pretty fast. The coolest thing I think was the open atmosphere though. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm all for the atmosphere and choice of serving food with natural ingredients and grass fed meat, however for the price this restaurant goes from \"not worth the money\" to \"a waste of money.\"  The veggies and bacon on my Big Big Burger were great, however the meat itself was very well done and pretty much burnt.  It's hard to even taste the other items on the burger. In addition, considering the burger is almost $10 there's not a whole lot of burger there, but the price does come with grass fed meat so I understand.  With the fries it truly does come down to personal preference, I stuck with the basic fry choice and opted not to get any of the seasoned fries.  The regular order of fries is sufficient for two people, however they were soggy and not appetizing at all.  I personally prefer crisp to my fries.  Lastly, we did try a concrete, vanilla with Oreos, and to be honest it was ok.  There wasn't really anything spectacular about it.  Also, it may seem like a little thing but it kind of just bugged me that there weren't lids for the 2 dollar baby cups that they give you to drink out of - but don't worry there's plenty of straws. It's a minor thing like I said, but don't expect to be taking a to-go cup to show off where you went to lunch. Total my wife and I spent over $30 on lunch and were frankly left wondering why. Overall, I feel like this simple burger joint has potential, but they simply fall short when it comes to the quality in which they prepare the food."}
{"text":"With the severe glut of slightly-above-mediocre burger places popping up in the last five years, it's really hard to think of a reason why this place should exist. I was no fan of Indulge Burger, but it's surprising that they didn't make it, yet Burgers N Fries is still going in the same location.

The burgers? Well, they're not that great. They're a little better than a normal fast food burger, but not anywhere near what I would expect for the $8-9 I paid. The bacon was indistinguishable from what you might find on a Wendy's double stack (thin and floppy). By the way, that bacon, and pretty much any other topping you might want to add outside of the standard lettuce and tomatoes, will cost you a couple bucks. That adds up *really* quickly.

The fries are... well, kinda decent. But kinda decent fries is not enough to establish a raison d'etre.

Honestly, I'd rather go to Five Guys. Sadly, Five Guys makes a better burger, and I never leave hungry. I did like that they had custard, if this place were called \"Frozen Custard\" instead of \"Burgers N Fries,\" it might be more worthwhile. Unfortunately, I was already at about $11 for just a burger and fries, and didn't want to drop another $6 on custard."}
{"text":"Burger was cooked way on the far side of well done.
Bun and toppings were fresh and tasty, but didn't overcome the burnt meat taste.
Cajun fries were way too salty - tasty for the first 6 or 8 fries, then overpowering.
The chair I sat in was made from '111 recycled Coke bottles' - that's great - don't burn the meat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! It's why my husband and I have been here 3-4 times in the last several months since discovering it. I love the veggie burger! A non-bean based burger made with rice, potatoes, carrots and spinach. It's light and delicious! My husband loves the Chicago dog and onion rings. The ice cream is great too! These are the reasons we kept going back. The thing is, EVERY TIME we have been there, something was wrong! The food never comes out all at once - one time we sat for 15 minutes after finishing our burgers before the onion rings arrived and having had to ask for them on more than one occasion. Extras I ordered on my veggie burger were missing. The soap in the restroom is empty (I hate the wash/dry sink combo but I get they're trying to be environmentally friendly). The ketchup is always empty. Today, however, was the last straw and we will never go back. One of the employees - a girl with long, dark hair - was brushing her hair at the counter where the ice cream is made/served. Ummm .. seriously GROSS! Later, this same girl was behind the window where the food was being made and I saw her run her fingers through her hair. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I told my husband he needs to contact the owner because even though we will never return, that's just disgusting and completely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Save your money and go elsewhere. I live in the neighborhood and thought I would stop by and have a nice lunch with my husband on our way to run errands. Big mistake it was like stopping by to donate $20 in a bucket without knowing the cause of the donation.  We ordered two mushroom burgers for $6.95 each and some onion rings. I'm not a big eater but the burgers were even to tiny for me to enjoy and get full.  The burgers were the size of two silver dollars, I kidd you not, and the onion rings had a thick batter on them and were hard on the outside and smushy in the inside.  WARNING GO ELSEWHERE IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD BURGER OR JUST A DECENT BURGER. This place offers neither."}
{"text":"The food was just really bad. The onion rings might have been good if the breading weren't cold and mushy. The \"Grilled\" hot dog had the taste and texture of boiled wiener. It was actually cold in the center. The buns were room temperature. This place makes me miss Indulge Burger even more. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is a joke they think their burgers are made of gold...  I wanted to like this place but the truth is no matter how good your burger is paying 17 dollars for a half pound burger fries and a small drink is ridiculous.   It is just like the overpriced indulge burger that used to be in this location that closed down.  I will not be coming back here as I don't like paying ridiculous prices for things that are not that great to begin with.  The bun is super small,  the burger is greasy,  non seasoned and tasteless for only 10 bucks.  I guess the fries are okay for only 4 bucks more.  Then you pay 3 bucks for a cup that holds about 5 cents of soda.   I don't see this place being here long."}
{"text":"Nice location... food disappointing. Nice sunny corner location with sliding doors for an open air feel on a nice day. Very friendly staff though I noticed they had trouble keeping track of customer orders (need a numbering system). Everything was served quickly and hot.
I had a double mushroom burger with fries and a drink. Not much taste to the undersized burger and the fries were just OK. I wanted to like this place... but taste comes first and it just wasn't up to par with the cost... guess I'll stick to less \"natural\" offerings for now."}
{"text":"It was ok.... the ordering system was a little confusing, but I am a smart girl and I figured it out. I was looking for a good burger and I found one just the way I wanted it, and the onion rings were good. Its just missing a little personality....?"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the food is to die for. I had the mushroom burger and added avocado and egg. It was so good. It's not a huge burger but I felt satisfied (not I'll) after I had eaten it. 

The staff were extremely friendly and made the experience enjoyable. 

I did go at an off time (almost 3pm) so there was no wait which was nice. 

Extremely impressed for my first visit! Will def come back. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on a quiet Sunday around 6pm. It was really empty- maybe 3 or 4 other small groups in there at the same time. The menu is small-ish but simple. I got the mushroom and Swiss burger and my hubs just tried the classic with avocado added. 

It's counter service and they bring your item to you when you grab a seat. I liked that it was quiet, we watched a bit of the NBA finals on the tv there while we waited about 10 minutes for our burgers and fries. 

I'm going to agree what many other reviewers have said- the food portions are a little on the small side. I don't eat a ton at once- so the burger was adequate for me. I had to have a little faith that it would fill me up though; based on looks alone, I would say it was a much smaller burger than most \"gourmet\" burger places. At around 8.50/burger, you might expect a little more. 

The burgers were tasty- both of us agreed that the food was pretty good. They tout organic grass fed meat, which is always nice to know- although sometimes can be overused buzzwords. 

The fries were so/so- just average. They were better than typical fast food joints but nothing differentiated them to make them stand out. 

2 burgers, 1 regular fry, and 1 soft drink ran us just under 20 bucks. 19 something... 

Although I don't like writing reviews after just one visit, I doubt I would return here in the near future. The value just isn't there- and there are other burger joints I would rather frequent for a similar price."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Burger n Fries yesterday. Since the products are all fresh and natural, I loved eating all that I ordered. It's hard to find onion rings like these and I enjoyed eating every single one."}
{"text":"Style over substance. This restaurant has a lot of polish to it but it's missing a lot of details that would make it more enjoyable for the diner.

The menu is printed on a 6' tall mirror as you walk in. It's not easy to read the menu especially when the mirror is reflecting a dark background, like dark clothes that you're wearing. I went safe and just ordered the All American Burger and shared a large fries with Parmesan and herbs. Also ordered an iced tea.

I was bummed that there weren't burger patty options on the menu, like bison, buffalo, turkey, etc. (If they were there I couldn't see them - see paragraph #2)

When you get to the register to order, you do get a nice warm greeting and friendly service. However, you can't see the menu anymore and it's a bit frustrating. They have two monitors on the back wall showing random product images but those images don't seem relevant or captivating, and even seem washed out from either poor monitors or poor photography. I think they'd be better served by having menu panels where customers are used to seeing them vs. a picture of ripe tomatoes.

I went to get my iced tea and found that they use Coke's bag-in-box Gold Leaf tea. So, it's \"natural\" burgers and \"formerly natural\" iced tea. I don't drink soda and I like good iced tea so I am dismayed when restaurants choose bag-in-box tea products vs one of the many quality fresh brewed products that are out there.

The burgers and fries came out in a timely manner with friendly service. The food was delivered on half sheet pans - one for my friend's hot dog (which was in a small paper tray), one for the fries, one for my burger. 

The burger is tiny, like McD's Quarter Pounder sized. I'm not looking for a huge burger but this little 4\" bun looked even worse sitting on the acreage of an otherwise empty half sheet pan. The presentation was awful. The burger did taste good but for the size it was more like a $4 burger especially since it doesn't include a side of fries. The fries were good and worth ordering again.

I want to like the place. It's nice with the open garage doors, the Big Ass Fan on the ceiling, the friendly service. But it seems that they put their money on the glitz of the project vs. on things that make dining better, and easier."}
{"text":"We decided to place an order and then go pick it up. The service was SLOW and DISORGANIZED. We paid for one hot dog (the smallest hot dog I have ever seen) and 4 burger (again they were very tiny and they only gave us 3). When we got home, lo and behold, they forgot the rest of the order. We also ordered a large fries and a large Onion Ring When we placed the order the sales person told us that the larges would feed 2 very hungry people and 3 so- so hungry people. So the large order of onion rings turned out to be 5 rings. Taste was so-so. Nothing to write home about. When I called and told them they did pack our 4th burger, the response on the other end was \"so do want to come back and get it\"? No actually we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Food!! This place is beautifully designed. My wife and I are on vacation and found this Gem! My burger and fries were made with love because they were fantastic! The burger was smaller than I thought it would be but I am trying to learn portion control any ways lol. I was filling and very tasty well balanced flavor!  When we come back on vacation here again one day we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh burgers.  Friendly fast service.  Been back 4 times in the last month or so.  Sides are monstrous so bring some friends"}
{"text":"Great environment and staff, even better food. Their burgers are all natural beef with no hormones or preservatives. Seriously if you go any burger or hot dog you'll be full and happy!"}
{"text":"Decided to take the family here after receiving a coupon and was intrigued by the all natural concept. We loved the decor and the place seemed clean. We were immediately disappointed when we discovered the lack of a kids menu. We were informed by the staff that we could order anything plain. So we get to pay $6 for a burger for our 6 year old. Same with the hot dogs. You pay for a Chicago dog and then tell them to hold all the good stuff.  Fries are separate although the large seemed to feed us all. We ordered waters and were presented with 5 shot glass sized plastic cups. I realize they make money on drinks but this is Arizona!  We need water. 

The only saving grace is that the food was pretty good. The burgers were small but had good flavor.  Just wondering how American cheese made into an all natural place.

We may come back, but I doubt we will make a special trip."}
{"text":"We've been there 3 times and each time the food was good (served piping hot, which is important for fries, right?) and the service was fast and friendly.

They have one of those whiz-bang self serve soda machines that let you choose your beverage with the option of adding different flavors.

.... and the price, more than fair.

I gave them five stars because they exceeded my expectations for a burger stand (it's not the Phoenician, so don't expect it to be)"}
{"text":"Great burgers and friendly service! The burger ingredients were very fresh and their shakes are delicious. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Yummy! Had the larger cheese burger and it was delish. Hot, juicy and fresh. Staff is passionate about their product and so friendly and happy. Ordering is super easy and we were served quickly. Cute patio area to enjoy a nice glass of vino. I am only able to eat grass fed beef and this is my new favorite spot. Will definitely be coming back. And....the frozen custard was fabulous!"}
{"text":"No wonder this place closed. I ate here once and the patties were unbelievably small and lacked any substantial flavors. The fries were meh. The are so many burger places saturating the marketplace so in order to succeed you're gonna have to do something to keep the customers coming back. i.e. the patties were smaller than in n out patties and the prices were twice as much so you may have had a nice place but if you don't follow up with good food you're not gonna be successful."}
{"text":"BurgerFi knockoff with TERRIBLE burgers.
Waited a few minutes to order as the cashier was too busy texting to take our order. I had the \"Brunch Burger\" and my wife had the \"Mushroom Burger.\" Although we were the only people there [Red flag at lunchtime], it took the kitchen over 20 minutes to make our food. Good food is not fast, correct? Well in this case bad food isn't fast either. My wife's burger was actually so thin there were holes in it. Adding insult to injury, it was bland and had a total of three mushroom slices - quite the \"Shroom Burger!\" My \"Brunch Burger\" was stacked so high as to be impossible to eat. Typically more is better, but this was definitely the exception. It was a messy, poorly planned, poorly executed, bland mess. Never again.
I personally enjoy burgers ranging from $30 Kobe to $5 Five Guys. Unfortunately, this had to be the WORST burger I've had in recent memory. 
You're better off going across the street to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Spendy but really tasty for a burger!! I had \"The Big Burger, Fries & a small drink & it was $17.50 !!! They also offer Gluten Free Options!! Super clean!! Great service!!"}
{"text":"IT's 6pm amd the place is empty. Save yourself some time and money and visit the few other burger joints in the area . The burgers here are super small and the fries a little over done and dont have any flavor. Just not worth the money at all...Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"I ate here with the family. Wife and I and 2 kids.

Hot dog kids meal
2 all American with bacon
Veggie burger

Ref onion ring & large onion ring

$44

To start off, burgers are super tiny. 

The veggie burger was like a mashed potato consistency plopped on a bun.

Onion rings were greasy and mostly breading. Large size was hardly distinguishable from regular size.

Young son didn't even like the hot dog, but main complaint was it was cut in half.

Overall not worth the price and we left hungry still."}
{"text":"This place ruined my order after I specifically told them what i wanted. Never going here again"}
{"text":"This place is really the best. Valerie (the owner) actually works with an organic farm to get the best blend of ground beef. Hands down, the BEST burger I've ever had in my life is the Brunch Burger!  Everything is awesome, not pricey at all, good beers on tap, and great servers. I also recommend the Shroom Burger and the Chicago Dog...or the Texas Dog. If you are on a low carb diet they make a great bunless burger too! Did I mention they have Hop Knot on tap?"}
{"text":"Very impressed! Pictures to come next time I'm here. They DO have kids meals! $5 for a burger and fries. Both kids and adult are 4oz burgers but u can add more patties if you want. Got the all American with bacon and Swiss. It was really good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"First visit here and we were super impressed! The burgers were flavorful and high quality, and we LOVE the fact that everything is all natural! We try to avoid artificial nonsense and knowing I'm feeding my family naturally made our experience even better!

Second, I'm not even a fan of fries but I couldn't stop eating them. They were so delicious! My kids devoured their dogs and shakes (custard! Yum!!!), and my husband and I were kicking our fingers post-burgers. Omg. The brunch burger was insane!

Third, the customer service is unbelievable. If every restaurant had service like Carla provides, I would honestly never cook again. She is a service all star!

We ended up chatting with the owner, Valerie, after we ate because we were so impressed with the whole dining experience. She's a sharp cookie with an awesome commitment to quality food and personnel. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out despite the reviews, and everyone is 100% spot on. The decor is cool looking. The bathroom was odd. The hand dryer is located on the one faucet. So if there are multiple people, they have to wait to wash their hands while you fight with the awkward dryer. For the ladies...they actually don't have sanitary depositories in the stalls. You have to walk out of the stall to the main trash to throw things away (unless I missed it somewhere). 

I had the veggie burger. It was tasty, but is definitely on the small side. I would agree that it is more like a slider. The fries are good as well. I'd say they are pretty much a normal portion size, but if I'm paying extra, it would be nice to have a larger portion.  The water cups are tiny. You have to sip it like a fine wine. I was not stuffed after the meal. I was able to go to the movies after and down a medium size popcorn without any issues. 

I hate to say, but I don't think this place is going to make it. I think for the cost, it's not worth it. They need to make things cheaper or provide larger portions. I don't think there was an option to double up the veggie patty?"}
{"text":"Normally the burgers are good but greasy.  Perhaps attributed to being \"fresh\". I ordered a chicken sandwich with no BnF sauce (yuck!) but add cheese. What I received was a nightmare. The smallest piece of lettuce and smallest tomato slices harvested by man. Spoke with manager who told me, when I brought the item back, the residue on the buns was cheese, not sauce, and they did not make a mistake. I find it hard to believe their cheese completely disintegrates into a sauce like substance after only 10 mins. She never acknowledged how terrible the sandwich looked. But did offer to cook another one. Why would I get a replacement if you can't see my perspective. She was rude, confrontational and started a conversation with someone else while allegedly helping me. After hearing I would not get a refund, I wrapped the sandwich mess up and threw it out in the store. She is the WORST manager! No customer service skills and a really crappy attitude. Do not eat here!  This is advice I'm telling everyone."}
{"text":"Not sure how a new restaurant expects to make it with this kind of customer service. Open till 10 on a Saturday supposedly, yet walk in at 9:38 for a to go order and told that they're closed. With 5 upscale burger places within 1/2 mile, we won't be trying this one again."}
{"text":"Like other reviewer we miss Indulge. When we arrive everyone was very nice and helpful and kept checking in on us. The music wss family oriented and pleasant in the background. 

The menu with glass background was hard to read and took some time. th mirror background and bright lights.

We ordered American Burger and mushroom burger. I was amazed within 4 minutes from ordering it was at our table. See pictures. They were smaller than I expected and tasted a little charcoal around the edges but overall for $5 Angus burger, good deal.  I will pass on the onion rings, probably just me but they did not have a lot of flavor.

Now the Keylime Custard was so yummy and would give 5 stars and will be back for desert for sure."}
{"text":"The menu is unreadable on the mirror-we immediately grabbed a paper one. I'm not sure why they added the grocery store style automated doors either. 

I got the all american burger, which was just okay. It was a burger with lettuce and condiments. No tomatoes or pickles-it just felt very plain. I didn't feel they offered much variety-the other burgers just added mushrooms or bacon. Boring. 

My husband got the texas style hot dog-and that chili was delish. We got a regular fry which was a monstrous portion-probably would feed 3-4 people. I can't imagine what the large is.

We came and used a coupon, but even with what we got plus two drinks it was 15 bucks. We might go back for the hot dogs, but overall the place is underwhelming."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  I'm not a huge burger fan.  I leave that to my family, but when I have a burger I want high quality, great tasting beef.  Burger N Fries doesn't disappoint in that department.  They start with yummy beef and have lots of great toppings, or you can just have a simple burger with lettuce and tomato.  Either way, you'll be satisfied.

They've got great beers too and the best tasting fries I've had in a long time.

Plus, the restaurant itself is pretty cool.  Great seating indoors and out and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Burgers n fries has amazing service and food! They let us in after they had already started to close and made us amazing meals perfectly."}
{"text":"Despite some spotty reviews, we decided to give Burger N Fries a try one recent Friday evening.  We always liked Indulge Burger (formerly at this location) but their prices didn't allow us to visit often.  

This place is casual.  You order/pay at the counter and food is brought to your table.  Note:  They also have a nice patio seating area, something to remember when the weather is more inviting.  Self-service sodas.  The service was very good, from the ordering to the delivery and checking on us after food came.  We ordered All American burger and the rest of us had Mushroom Burgers.  Also had a basket of half & half fries/onion rings to share.  We all enjoyed our burgers.  I'm not a burger snob and could care less about grass fed but I thought the meat was especially good and prepared as requested.  The buns were outstanding - substantial but nicely soft.   I didn't find the fries/onion rings to be all that exciting and would probably skip next time.  The onion rings were a little bready for my taste.  We didn't try dessert but the ice cream concoctions looked tempting for a future visit.  

To all those who complained about small burgers and high prices, maybe you need to get a reality check on size.  I thought the size was adequate, actually \"just right\".  And for the area, I think the prices are in line.  Yes, you can find bigger burgers and you can find smaller prices.  If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty of other burger options and fast food places just down the road.  I think Burger N Fries is making a fine effort with quality food and service.  I intend to support this new local business."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after seeing a new burger with natural beef open up.  There is some decent options to customize a burger, but with dietary restrictions it seems more like a burden asking questions about what's in certain sauces.  Also the burger is very small.  Literally like a large slider.  I don't know if it even qualified as a quarter pound burger. If the meat didn't have a great taste it would have resulted in a 1 star.  I hope they can turn things around, staff be happy to serve, and the burger size increase dramatically."}
{"text":"First timer, Never Again!!!
Tonight was my first time eating here. It is conveniently located by my house, so I decided to pick something up on my way home. My first sign should have been a totally empty restaurant at 6:30pm. Cashier was friendly. I ordered a cheeseburger and the fries/onion rings side to go. 
I got home and pulled everything out of the bag (that now seemed to be saturated with grease). The fries looked so limp and drenched with grease. The onion rings were also limp and not crispy at all. Like the exact opposite of crispy - mushy and the batter was falling off. At this point I was totally unimpressed. Then I bit into my burger, and the entire inside of my burger was RAW MEAT! I started pulling it apart to make sure it wasn't just one section, but the entire thing was RAW! And the patty was so thin, it's like the cook had no idea how long it should have been on the grill?!?  I fed the burger patty to my dog and threw the rest in the trash. I seriously could have had a better burger (and fries) at McDonalds, for half the price. 
I called the to store, spoke to the manager and let her know. She was apologetic and offered to remake my food and deliver it, but I declined. I'm sick to my stomach (literally). Maybe this was a fluke, but I will not be spending my money here ever again. I mean, how do you mess up French fries?!?"}
{"text":"I've never felt like such a bother being a customer in a business before. We walked in 1 hour before close (which we felt bad about but there were still people coming in after us). The second we parked all the employees were glaring at us and watching our every move. We didn't feel welcome. There was one other table there. We weren't even greeted. We live close by and were excited that we could've found our regular burger place! It took us a few minutes to look over the menu, but we ordered something quickly because everyone was staring at us. Our order was wrong but we didn't even want to tell them because we didn't want confrontation, just ate it to deal. We felt like we were being timed. Felt like we were being stared down because they had to do their job because they were still open. We felt so unwelcome that my boyfriend said to the cashier \"hope we aren't being a bother for coming in 1 hour before close\" and he apologized. The cashier just looks at him! Glaring us down some more. Luckily there was ONE nice employee which made us stay. While we were eating they all were glaring at us waiting for us to get out. We didn't even finish, we felt so unwelcome we left quickly after scarfing down most of the food. We gave the female worker a tip because she deserved it and we felt bad for her! I've never felt so unwelcome as a customer in my entire life. We will never return. Never have been treated so rudely and glared at just for being customers! How horrible is that for business? So disappointed. People go out to eat for good food but honestly, being treated good matters just as much. 

Anyways, the food is just ok. Maybe it would be better if the employees actually didn't hate you. Kudos to the chick that works hard and has a smile on her face! She deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon that the owner was very confused about.  Which I was surprised that he had never heard of having a relationship with the company. But the two workers there were awesome,  exceptional customer service.  We ended up enjoying the meal, great burgers, fantastic onion rings, so good to go, just don't use a coupon. Oh, and they had a nice selection of craft beer too!"}
{"text":"This is where Indulge Burgers used to be.  My wife and I were so sad when that place closed, but this is a worthy sucessor.  We eat burgers far more often than we should and this is in solid rotation.

It is more expensive than other burger places, but when you consider that the beef is grass fed and the sides are huge then it is quite reasonably priced.  The beef has a great flavor and you can top it with pretty much anything you like.  I love their fries, skinny and well seasoned (if you like the thick cut steak fries then they will not be your thing) and the onion rings are good, too.

It is an order at the counter and seat yourself place.   No fanfare, order, sit, eat!  

A very solid spot."}
{"text":"By far one of the best burgers in the area! I love that fact that Burger N Fries is all about natural food!!!

The prices are insanely low for the quality. The Mushroom Swiss is my absolute favorite burger and I can never decide between the Onion Rings and the French Friends because they are both divine!

The burgers aren't ginormous but are extremely filling. The side portions are very large and can easily be split between 2 people. 

Seating is abundant and the outside patio is perfect in the cooler months. Burger N Fries is 5 stars all around in my book!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The burgers were great and the service was exceptional. We arrived just as they were closing and they reopened the kitchen just for us."}
{"text":"As you may be able to tell from my other reviews, Indulge closing sent me into a deep, that-was-my-favorite-place-ever depression. I just wanted to know WHY and was left without any answers, like my boyfriend had just broken up with me and not given me any closure. I had never had a burger so delicious. Every place I go is measured against Indulge, and no one ever stacks up. When I saw this place opening, the font felt familiar and my conspiracy theories kicked in. Maybe my beloved Indulge was opening up under a new name. I have since been assured that is not at all the case (more tears). We finally got over there to try Burgers N Fries tonight.

I love the doors (saw that someone didn't like those) and the open feeling. The menu on the mirror is a bit hard to read, but I know what I want so no biggie. We ordered and everyone was very nice. The food came really fast and the girls came by our table a bunch and were SUPER nice. Now....to the big moment...the burger was GREAT. I hate overly complicated burgers or burgers that taste like they were cooked at home. This was neither - it was just good, basic and delish. If I were to say Indulge burgers were 9.5, this burger was an 8.75 or 9. The closest I have been able to find since Indulge closed. I will say maybe the cheese slices could be a bit thicker, maybe a tiny bit more cheese. Anyhow, I actually LOVED that it wasn't this massive thick burger. I can't eat all that anyhow (and really, shouldn't we all stick to smaller portions my fellow Americans?). The men can get the double if they need it. 

The fries were good and the shake was great (maybe a tiny bit too thick which sometimes can make it not as cold as I'd like). I love custard, mmm! 

Our meal for two people came to about $30, which did kind of feel over-priced. But, knowing this is the closest I have been able to get to my fave burger, I am willing to pay it! 

One thing I will add specific to other reviews about natural beef. It is a HUGE deal, and I will ONLY eat at places with natural/grass fed beef. If you don't care, you should. 

I hope they make it, don't be the second to break my heart (stomach)! 

PS I am still wondering why my boyfriend Indulge broke up with me. WTF happened to them? I thought things were going so great with us. ;)"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try because I received a flyer with coupons in the mail. The flyer advertised that they deliver and that was the selling point.

The girl who answered the phone wasn't friendly. She sounded bored and aggravated.

I missed some calls n texts while I was busy because the delivery girl couldn't find my apartment. I didn't even know until after the delivery. I'm not sure how long she spent looking, but she didn't say a word and seemed pissed. Also, my food was cold and the fries weren't even edible. I feel bad about the inconvenience of not being able to find my place, but seems odd since it has never been an issue before.

The burger was okay. Kinda plain and pretty small. The fries might have been better hot, but just seemed okay as well. The custard was alright, but just not blended that well. I'd rather just make the drive to Smashburger if I'm craving a burger n fries."}
{"text":"I would totally love to support Burger N Fries, as I can see that the staff and management are very motivated and want to provide great service.  I also live across the street.

Unfortunately, the puny 4 ounce patty simply didn't cut it, and it felt like it was 2 ounces after cooking.  The excellent bun totally dominated the patty, and this is the kiss of death for a burger business. 

Admittedly, I don't care about grass fed vs. grain fed beef, but I couldn't taste anything special about it, and the patty size was insulting.  A Smashburger kids meal provided more satiety for me than the All American Burger, fries and drink for half the price.  Not a good start to what I hoped would be a long term relationship.  

The fries were excellent.  Unfortunately, all the customer service and health benefits in the world won't compensate for a puny burger, and I know this from growing up in the business.  My father was once the Vice President of Burger Chef, and original creator of the first kids meal with toys in 1972.  Burger Chef is now known as Hardees on the East Coast and Carl's Jr. on the West Coast.  My uncle also owned the first Wendy's territory in Massachusetts.

While none of this makes me an expert on the Burger business, I am quite certain that \"perceived value\", along with overall consistency, are imperative to long term success in this business.

The perceived value in my first experience was average to low, and I hate to say this.  Conversely, my perceived value in a Smashburger or Carl's Jr. is normally quite high, irrespective of the service.  The food is the prevailing element to repeat business.   

Since I would like to see Burger N Fries succeed, I think this portion problem could be easily remedied by switching to 1/3rd pound patties, and offering the option of ordering up to 3 patties on a burger.  If it costs more, then so be it, but with a substantial increase in sales volume, the price increase shouldn't be dramatic.  An empty restaurant costs infinitely more than higher food costs, and this is what I see happening here on a daily basis.

I also question the premise of a \"healthy\" burger joint.  Why isn't \"grass fed beef\" an optional item like a turkey or veggie burger?  There are far more heathens out there like me who would prefer a larger, grain fed burger, so why isn't that an option?  Is there anything healthy about eating fried foods at all, when you are combining high amounts of fats and starches?  I don't think so.

If I had to grade Burger N Fries on attitude and service, it would easily be a 5 Star.  You've done an exemplary job in this regard, but the burgers need fixing.  You don't need to compete with McDonald's, or offer a dollar menu.  You simply need to make Burger N Fries more of a \"burger joint\" rather than a health food restaurant.  That concept has been attempted many times, and failed \"EVERY\" time.

Burgers, buns, fries, and sodas are never going to be \"HEALTHY,\" and the sooner you realize this, the faster you will be able to improve your business model.  

I'm not the first person to state that the small, grass fed patties don't have the \"WOW FACTOR,\" and I hope you are paying attention to this.  I would like to support your business, which is why I put so much time and thought into writing this review."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger place in the Phoenix area. The burgers are grass-fed beef and delicious! I'm not all hipster and stuff, but grass-fed truly is so much better than any of those chain places. It's good and bad that they are never busy. They even made me a special treat for my birthday!! I worry that it will close before it's appreciated for what it offers. Come and enjoy this place as I do!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not even a decent fast-food burger joint. The burgers are flavorless and overly greasy, there isn't much variety on the menu, and the service is awful. It's kind of cool that the garage doors open up to create a fresh-air atmosphere, but that means lots of flies buzzing around your food. The fries here were good, but there isn't any sauce to dip them in other than ketchup and bottled ranch."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered delivery and although the burgers were cold they were good. This time I did a to go order and I don't even know what to say. I am not sure if I am eating a burger or left over grease... It is the most burnt piece of black stuff I ate and no they didn't ask me how I like my burgers which now I learned I should've asked for medium rare. If only Hop Doddy did to go orders but I really should've just driven through in and out. They need to learn how to cook their burgers or clean their grill not sure. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday Evening and there was no one here. Almost thought they were closed.

Ordered the Mushroom Burger and Regular French Fries which was pretty good but not very big.

Don't think this place will be around much longer with no business on a Saturday"}
