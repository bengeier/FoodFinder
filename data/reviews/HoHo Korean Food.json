{"text":"Very nice new Korean place at the food court! Generous portion with appetitzers. Ordered the seafood tofu soup and it was really good!"}
{"text":"As a fast food shop in a food court, I think HoHo is pretty good. I ordered a Bimbim Bap, haven't had this dish for a long time. I was given a beeper after I have placed my order, so I could do some window shopping in the plaza while I am waiting for my order. After all, I don't have to wait very long. All the ingredients that a Bimbim Bak should have are there and it also comes with three side dishes even I requested for a take out. Each side dish is put in individual containers, so that they are kept in their unique taste. It also comes with a type of Asian teas, seems like a rice tea to me but I am not sure. Overall, it is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Korean food court places. The food quality is comparable, if not better than many Korean restaurants, the portions are very generous, and the price is very reasonable.  The leek seafood pancake ($13.99) is loaded with seafood and is a very sizable portion. It's crispy, light, and not greasy. Comes with kimchi, japchae, and bean sprouts.   The Bulgogi bento box ($10.99) has a heaping portion of good-quality lean sliced beef and comes with three dumplings, kimchi, and japchae. Also comes with a mountain of purple rice, which is much nicer than the standard steam rice served elsewhere.  Overall, I think this place is fantastic and will keep coming back whenever I'm in the mood for some quick Korean food."}
{"text":"4 stars for the fact that they have 5 lamb skewers for $4.99. Minus points for the fact that they're more spiedini than traditional skewers. They're very uniform in size and shape. Rather angular, like frozen spiedini, and also like spiedini in size. They're definitely lamb and rather tasty, but I was expecting more cumin and chili powder, which is visibly there, and less rosemary flavor, which is also definitely there. I would get this again though."}
{"text":"HoHo Korean food is the newest Korean food stall to open up in the First Markham Place food court. They sell many of the typical Korean restaurant offerings, such as pork bone soup, spicy rice cakes, bulgogi, bibimbap, and so forth. After placing your order, they give you a paging device to notify you when your order is ready. They offer free tea for customers.    We ordered bibimbap and a bulgogi box. The bulgogi bento box came with fried dumplings, japchae, purple rice, and a bit of kimchi (could be more in my opinion). Hubby wasn't even able to finish his whole meal as the portions were sizeable. The bulgogi wasn't very big but came with 3 types of banchan (kimchi, japchae, and saut√©ed eggplant slices) as well as a clear cup of soup broth. The sauce came on the side. Despite the small serving size, I was reasonably full after eating my meal. The prices are reasonable.   I noticed they serve the pork bone soup boiling hot! I definitely want to return to try it. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is located within the first markham place food court. I came here on a Sunday evening and the food court wasnt busy. This restuarant had a few people ordering. I got the pork bone soup which was $8.99 plus tax with a total ofn$10.16. The pork bone soup came with 4 huge pieces of pork bone. The soup had this korean seasme leaf on it. Not alot of people can handle this taste but I enjoyed it. Its kinda a mixture between mint leaf, celery, and cilranto. So if you dont like any of those I would remove it before eating. They put the fresh seasme leaf and black pepper right on top of the soup. I took a scoop of black pepper out of my soup cuz I know it will make my soup too spicy and salty. The soup was had lots of huge chunk of kimchi. The soup itself was very flavourful. The kind of flavour you know isnt coming from msg. I wasnt thirsty at all after this soup. It wasnt too spicy either. It came with three different side dishes, kimchi, glass noodle, and broccoli. It also came with a huge bowl of purple rice. I was so so so so full after this, and I still had half a bowl of rice and soup left. I will definitely come back and try their dumpling soup next time."}
{"text":"Agree with all the other review. Food is quality made and you can tell they put heir heart into making good food. Paging system is good, as you can browse around and relax. Side dishes are separated into 3 separate containers, which lets their distinct flavours to stay separate. The side dishes are yummy and taste of higher quality than others in the food court. Other Korean stalls in the same food court, put the side dishes all together and flavours mix."}
{"text":"i am work near the building....1st time i go to shop around their deep fried pork chop on rice,the pork chop taste was very good,very juices...."}
{"text":"Good food, good portion, good price.   Hope they have more selections on rice cake. Will try the tofu soup next time."}
{"text":"Ho Ho!  Am I jolly because its almost Christmas time and I'm in the holiday mood?  No, I'm jolly because I got to have some great pork bone soup at Hoho Korean Food in First Markham Place!  There is some serious value with the Pork Bone Soup combo.  For $10.16 taxes in, you get 3 sides, a bowl of purple rice, tea and a big ass serving of pork bone soup with the pork bone taking up most of the bowl!  Can you say great deal??    The soup itself was excellent, flavourful and not too spicy.  The sides were tasty and purple rice done very well.  Service was friendly and they even gave a pager to let you know when your food is ready as you walk around the mall!  Would definitely be back to try their other items.  Solid 4/5!"}
{"text":"This place opened up recently inside First Markham Place Food Court.  We tried the pork bone soup take out and when we brought it home, we were pleasantly surprised they give such big portions!  There were a least 6 pieces of pork bones along with potato and some veg, purple rice and 3 side dishes of kimchi, potato salad and cold noodles.  Not bad for $8.99!  I find the taste just right because I don't like it when the soup is too spicy.  They have hand held buzzers that notify you when your order is ready, that's a bonus so I can walk around the mall and not worry about when my order is ready.  We will definitely be ordering from this place more often!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked their food here. Not only are they super friendly but the portion sizes of their food menu is actually really big compared to other food court restaurants.   I had their pork tonkatsu and it came with we dumpling pieces and unlimited Katsu sauce that you can get at their station.   What I really liked was the size of the pork. Usually you get one big slice and it usually is very thin but this one is big bite size pieces and they give you two big slices! What a deal! It does cost $9.99 compared to your other food court deals of $7.99 but it's so worth it for more meat."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup is good! Great value and quality. The food came fast. Banchan was good - love the kimchi."}
{"text":"I was undecided for food and saw this new restaurant open in the forever busy food court of FMP.  I took the plunge and ordered the Pork Bone Soup  - PBS.  Many of the other items as I was waiting looked very yummy too... or was I just starving and any/ everything just looked super yummy?  Within 3 minutes of my order, this bubbling concoction was brought out with a healthy serving of purple rice and assortment of banchan to dig into.  The soup came with 4 large and meaty pieces of bone to indulge in, along with a potato. The soup was very rich and had very nice flavor (as compared to the 2 other neighbors where I find their soups are not as rich and flavorful) - check!  The bone/ meaty portions were still very moist and had good flavor, I did see a few people staring at me attacking my meal... maybe they were wondering if this guy was deprived of food for the last little while, but I was truly in my own little world enjoying this treat.  The rice and banchan accompanied the meal very well.  If I had to complain, it would be... the cup of water was only 3/4 full?  Is that even valid?  All in all, I will definitely return to try out their other dishes and see how I make a fool of myself in-front of the crowds."}
{"text":"This place is in the First Markham Place food court and I ordered the kimchi fried rice. I've been here once before and I previously got the kimchi pancake but it looks like they removed it from the menu already. I wanted to give this place another try, since the pancake I got before was pretty good. Like a lot of Korean restaurants, they give you a buzzer to know when your food's ready instead of calling out numbers/orders like neighbouring stalls. The order actually comes in a take out container so when you're not done your food you just have to go up and ask for the lid which I think is handy. The kimchi fried rice was good and the portion is huge!  They gave a lot of rice so I was not able to finish it all in one sitting. It would be better if there was less rice and a bit more pork in the mix. I enjoyed eating at this place and the workers were all really nice as well. Would come back to try other items on the menu such as the pork bone soup or tofu soup!"}
