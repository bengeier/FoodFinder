{"text":"We just recently got a delivery order from here and we were very pleased with the food.  We got a lot for what we paid for and it was very tasty.  This is the first time I've eaten Chinese food in Quebec that tastes like it does in the rest of Canada.  China town is a great place and we also love lots of places there too,  but this one is close to home and we can get it delivered. They actually have chicken balls and proper sweet and sour (red) sauce,  even though they call it pineapple sauce.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good tasty Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is bad, avoid at all cost.  Their main ingredient is soy sauce, and nothing else. They add so much that the fried rice I got is completely black.  Wonder why it's always empty? Because their food taste awful... Everything is filled with soy sauce to the point that you can't even taste anything.  Also, their menu is not very informative with names like \"Beef and mushroom\", \"Beef and brocoli\", \"Beef and xxx\"... At least tell us with what and how you're cooking it... Oh never mind, just soy sauce I guess.  And when you list several dishes under \"Chow Mein\", I do expect fried noodles, not CHOP SUEY. Learn the difference please.  You want Chinese food? Go to Chinatown, you won't get that here."}
{"text":"Combo Dinner for 1: they charge you more to substitute vegetables over brown gravy spare ribs and to have the chow mein and fried rice sans chicken? Give me a break, that makes no sense whatsoever and punishes people for being vegetarian. You're sooo off my list FamiLi."}
