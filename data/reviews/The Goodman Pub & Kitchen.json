{"text":"Went with friends for an awesome waterfront toronto experience and chose This pub to eat.  Ordered the Brine Turkey Sandwich with salad. Total write off. One piece of bread toasted heavy or flat grilled on one side and the other Slice of bread not toasted at all. It was a bit of an odd technique -  if it was intended. Hardly any turkey on it at all - maybe 40 - 45 grams tops. It had a small single piece of tomatoe that was mushy and had chopped wilted lettuce. Salad was a side portion that cost an extra 2$ but was an extra small side salad with a few very small bits of the highlight ingredients in the salad - so sparse - I had to examine it to ensure proper identity of the ingredients that it matched the description. The bread was multigrain which is a bit dry most places you get it but my bread was sufficiently dry that it caused the top slice corners of the bread to curl up. I think it was a $20 sandwich plate with the salad and taxes. 

The wait service was very good. The kitchen staff needs some coaching with an emphasis on quality and value oversight for anything that comes out of that kitchen. Tell them to take ownership of their product!"}
{"text":"Not sure how new they are but maybe give these guys a few months to find their footing. Walked by twice this weekend during the Canada Day duck business and they had people lined up with plenty of open tables. They were \"staggering\" seating to deal with a backup in the kitchen (for two hours at least) and decided that it was a good idea to also not seat people that only wanted drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible. 

Came here for a quick dinner with a friend. The service was slow, burger hard and dry, and the bartender put soda water in my gimlet. Wait staff are sweet, dazed teenagers who are impossible to flag down. This is just a terrible experience: do yourself a favour and skip it."}
{"text":"Ambience: 4/5. Nice waterfront patio
Service : 3/5. Friendly staff but not too attentive and slow 
Food: 2/5. Got the turkey burger - under seasoned and over cooked. The tiki tacos were good but nothing to write home about. 

Cool for patio drinks but wouldn't recommend as a dinner spot."}
{"text":"Was here the other day and it was awesome. The view of the lake is to die for. My server Brad killed it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Fish and chips cold and soggy.  Other than that it was a nice setting on the water.  Others seemed to have enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Service was great .... Kay was our server and she was helpful, courtious and actually joined in a very friendly conversation.    Food was also good.  Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would, waited an hour and 15 minutes for the food, had to hunt down staff to ask about where our food was , was told it was next to come out, when it arrived it was all cold except for one of the lbs of wings. Horrible food and service. Will not be going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food and drink were great. . Caesar walked us through the menu and his selections were on point. If you go to The Goldman make sure you ask for Caesar. Thanks."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited The Goodman on Sunday morning for brunch on the patio. The patio was lovely and I was seated immediately which I appreciated considering you cannot make a reservation. The menu offers great selection of brunch/lunch/dinner and they have a deal on champagne and orange juice for $29 that is hard to beat. With that said, I was incredibly disappointed with the service at The Goodman. I had to ask for my coffee and water to be refilled multiple times, and our brunch/lunch took over 40 minutes to come. We ordered a salad, and two breakfast egg dishes, which do not take much time at all and there were plenty of open tables at the time, so the staff were not swamped. The couple next to us, who sat down 20 minutes after we did, received their food well before we did and they ordered burgers. I live across the street and I was excited for a new fun place to open along the waterfront, however now I will consider it simply an option to go to if I want to stay in the area - rather than what I was hoping would be a new staple restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff but the nacho's......truly disappointing. I ordered the nachos and I was not impressed. $18 for chips with hardly any cheese, a drizzle sour cream, no salsa and a blop of guac on the top. I was looking forward to filling my stomach with goodness next to the beautiful view, but I was dissatisfied. And they call these loaded nacho's."}
{"text":"I am visiting this place first time since renovation. I am disappointed I will never be back to this place again. my fish tacos were over cooked ... crunchy and over the over cooked wraps. I have to wait for my food for over 45 mins and thats what they come up is a piece of cardboard over a cardboard.  The server wasn't great either. To add i wrote this review while i was waiting for my food. this place lacks energy and good vibe. Disappointment.."}
{"text":"Slow service (15 minutes from the time we sat down for a waitress/waiter to take our drink order).

When we got our drinks 20 minutes later, they were in dirty drink glasses (everyone's still had lip balm / lip stick dirt on the rims).

Subbpar food. Ordered chicken pot pie which was apparently made in house every day, and the only saving grace was the pie crust. The filing was so watered down like a broth, not gooey as pie filling ought to be.

2 chicken pot pies and 2 beers + tax came up to $60 before tip. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful location. Must try the cauliflower wings. They are amazing
 Good options for vegetarians and vegans as well. I ordered the poke and it was delicious but very small.and very overpriced. My only complaint is the way overpriced menu."}
{"text":"Okay I've now been here three times. Hey, it's convenient! So they REALLY need to work on the service and operations. Last weekend we waited 30 minutes to sit outside. Fine right? Except their system made NO SENSE. They just have everyone line up. Meanwhile, a table for two is open, but the people in the front of the line need a table of 4 while further down the line is a table of two. We also watched some tables sit open for 15 minutes. Once we were seated the service was quick until we ordered. It probably took 45 minutes for our to come out. I had the chicken sandwich, which was very good, 8/10. We also had the poutine, which was good, 7/10. Buffalo cauliflower need work, 5/10.

Then I went again tonight. Seated on the side patio, which is a lot less busy. The restaurant was still very busy for a Tuesday night. We were just having a drink and an app. It took more than 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. We ordered right away and the app came out quickly, but no beer. I had to ask for the beer twice. Kind of weird to be halfway through your food and not even have a beer. Then it took a good while to get the check. So yeah, Tuesday night, one beer, one app and we were there an hour! Hope they can work out the service issues!"}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times for working lunches. I've had the chicken sandwich and all of the salads. I also tried the burger and the tuna poke. The food is fine at best. Generic and edible. The service is typically good and the ambiance is nice. I would not come here on my own time."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem on my way the from the Jays game and have to say...what a find! If you haven't already, check it out! The menu was is very good, even includes some Gluten conscious items (although only a few). Food was fresh and very good. 

Only spent time in the dining area, so not sure about the bar or patio areas. But the staff was super friendly, and I have to say the service was top notch! Too many places in Toronto have great food but don't provide good service. This place is the exemption to that. Never had an empty glass on the table, dirty dishes were quickly removed and every server made themselves available to help! 

Will definitely be making a second trip here!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately each experience I've had here is incredibly slow. My colleagues and I waited an hour for our food. They brought half the table's food 1 hour in and the other colleagues had to wait another 40 minutes for their food while watching us eat. I give it two stars for the decent wings and food but the service was way too slow. 

Please work on how fast you bring out the food."}
{"text":"The food was super yum. The service was off the charts.

First, the food: shared avocado toast / tomato soup / ZEN bowl with Thai chili chicken. All delicious and flavorful. Beer selection was great.

Next, the service: Jon, our server, was absolutely amazing. It was his second shift (ever) at Goodman, which he shared with us as soon as he sat us. He was ready with beer recommendations, thoughtfully considered and genuine. He also encouraged us to put a food order in because the kitchen was running behind. He did the best he could, given the heavy volume, and he handled the pressure with grace and integrity. He made time to ask questions and get to know us while not compromising on his service. All-in-all, some of the best service I've ever received. Before leaving, Jon wrote down some recommendations he thought we'd enjoy around town during our stay. Really can't speak highly enough about him.

So ... why not five stars?? There was some oddness around the wait. There were plenty of tables open, but the hostesses were only seating parties every five minutes (so they'd seat someone, wait five minutes, seat another group, etc). This meant a long wait out on the steps and sidewalk, which would have been more pleasant (and more profitable for them!) sitting at a table with a cold adult beverage in hand. They said it was to alleviate the pressure on the kitchen, but it really wasn't much help. It would have been better to be honest about the kitchen delays and let folks decide if they wanted to sit, serve them drinks and take their money!"}
{"text":"My Complaints:
1 No one at the front to seat me at a table, so I had to seat myself.
2 Sat on an old wobbly chair, and had to change it for a less wobbly chair.
3 Ordered fish and chips, fish was burnt/over-cooked, and fries were cold. Had it sent back and replaced. 
4 Waitress passed me by, over and over again, inattentive to me - felt ignored.
5 The music was annoyingly distasteful hip hop etc
* The only thing good was the TV and the view outside"}
{"text":"I went as part of a small group to this place back in June or July but I remember it well. We were seated inside and I had a froze, a burger (can't recall the name of it...it had elk meat in it) and fries. The fries were good, the froze was like a delicious slushy that I enjoyed drinking, and the burger was rather dry. I remember commenting on this because we had just been to another restaurant (our group) the previous week and the burgers were better there). Nice spacious seating area and great drinks but the burger was dry. Sorry  to be the bearer of bad burger news."}
{"text":"Been here twice and have received nothing but delicious food and a beautiful view (luckily enough both days was clear). The service is spotty at times but the waitress was pleasant and did her best. She had a lot of tables so I don't blame her. I think Goodman should hire additional staff. 

The table mimosa was definitely worth it. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  Premium prices for shitty, shitty food.  I had a burger and it was one of the worst burgers I ever had in my life.  It was grey, hard, dry and had an unpleasant taste about it.  It came served on one of driest, most dense buns I've ever been served.  I skipped the bun and choked down the burger.  For this, with a dull Ceasar salad made from shredded lettuce, I paid $23.

At the same table, a companion bought a turkey burger and ended up not eating the patty because it was very dry and hard.  This place sucks!"}
{"text":"I am sure you know the drill from the terrible reviews...arrive...restaurant is about 50% full so we are, inexplicably, seated next to a giant office party that are all standing around their tables chatting...ten minutes without service we go to the hostess and ask to be moved to another table...ten minutes without service at the new table and we got up and walked out...on my way out, I told the hostess we were leaving and her response was basically \"meh\"...just atrocious."}
{"text":"A bunch of us at work decided to go our for lunch and a couple of them suggested this place and as most of us had not tried this, we decided to go for it. It was the end of the after labour day and so the tourist and local traffic was significantly less and the day being slightly cooler than normal made it more so.

WE were seated quickly and even though close to downtown and quite a few offices nearby, it seemed not too busy for lunch. Quickly ordered and got that out of the way. Tons of TVs around so would be a great place to catch up a game and the bar seemed good as well.

The orders did come a bit slow to our liking and not all the orders came at the same time or one after the other which causes some odd moments and it was my lucky day - my order came out the last and it was quite some time between the first and mine.

The non Burger, Burger was black bean patty which didn't taste as such and was quite better than I expected. Had a good meaty texture and topped up nicely. Had requested with no cheese and mayo and instead with mushrooms which I think they forgot. Also ordered with fries and came with sweet potato fries which I let it slip, thinking it was mixed up with someone else and would not be charged. Not quite so which was OK, however I did not ask for it.. The fries were presented nicely and fried perfectly. But no ketchup on the side or on the table, when requested, took too long to come by."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection, great view...nuff said. Server was super helpful as well as attentive."}
{"text":"Worst. Experience. Ever. Amateurs and dilettantes scrambling to keep up in a moderately busy happy hour. Clueless management is full of excuses for inexcusable lack of service (\"everyone arrived at once and everyone wants separate checks\"), embarrassingly poor table maintenance, mediocre food and terribly loud music. The staff here look and act like they're miserable and hate their jobs. There's no pride in the work, the restaurant looks like a bomb hit and no one survived to clean up the mess. This place sets a very low bar and doesn't manage to reach it anyway. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"Took way too long to get the food.  Horrible service and not friendly staff. There was n"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? 

I made a reservation at The Goodman Pub & Kitchen on Saturday night for a group of 18 for my girlfriend's birthday. Admittedly, I did not expect the service to be quick given our large group.  We placed our order at approximately 8-8:15 but the food did not arrive until 9:30. The restaurant was clearly understaffed as our requests for drinks were slow, repeatedly missed and required us to follow up. We were given a few dirty wine glasses which we asked the waiter to replace, but the replacement glasses were dirty as well. 

We had an order of the Crispy (Crunchy?) Chicken Sandwich that was undercooked and required us to send it back. There was no way we were going to wait for them to replace the meal again (which to be fair, they comped).

I brought in a birthday cake at the beginning of the night for them to bring out near the end of our meals. The cake was brought out with one lit sparkler and 3 UNLIT candles. No cutlery/plates/knife were brought out until I got up to ask the waiter to bring it out for us. I asked why the candles were not lit and the response I got, believe it or not, was that it was lit but the wind blew it out on the way to the table. Hard to believe all three candles were blown at the same time but not a big deal, however, no one at the restaurant bothered to relight the candles before leaving us alone with the cake. 

When I called in to make the reservation, I was given the options of having everything on one bill or separate bills. I chose the latter and was told it wouldn't be a problem. Sorting out the orders at the end of the meal was a whole other s*** show, which we expected when they brought out our meals and had no idea who ordered what. Many of the items were incorrectly placed on a different bill. We had to sort out the bills personally after we left the restaurant. 

In no way is this a hyperbole - this was easily the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had. I am usually not one to write restaurant reviews but the poor quality of service we received was extreme. I have never left a restaurant paying absolutely no tips but I guess there is a first time for everything. I genuinely felt bad that I made my friends sit through this disaster of a night that was The Goodmans Pub & Kitchen with me and ruined a night of celebration for my girlfriend. 

To put this into context, a family of four right behind us also had similar complaints as they waited an hour for their meal to arrive so I'm not sure this disaster was due to our large group."}
{"text":"This place has been steadily going downhill over the years, and no amount of rebranding will make their food better.

But - given the location, even if it was a hotdog stand, it'd still have giant lineups, so no amount of bad reviews will stop people from going there - just don't expect anything out of this world.

The heaters on the patio are a nice touch - they are only in the semi enclosed section though."}
{"text":"Really cool pub right by the lake. They have a heated patio surrounded by glass so no ratchets can reach in and steal your food, or ya girl I guess. 
The inside is also very aesthetic, definitely something you'd find on a Toronto instagram. 

Service was great and they accommodated us very well! Our food, bill and everything else we needed came at a great time & it was a good experience overall. Waitresses were all very friendly. 
They have very unique items on the menu and it is pricier than most places, so definitely a good spot for a date night or something. Portions are huge though, lots of plates that you can share. 

The masala calamari is very plain and definitely a let down as it was just crunchy pieces of batter mostly. Meh. Maybe a solid 2/5. 
The avocado toast was yum- I sound like a basic b saying that but it's true, millennial luuuuuv their avocados. It was super good & filling. My coworker and I split this and it was two half slices each. Kind of basic for $14-15 but meh, you live once. Enjoy those avocados while you can. 
My other colleague had the thai noodle, which is vegan friendly and it was delicious! Asian and white fusion made for a great combo. 

Lots of unique drink options as well. I saw tons of delicious drinks ranging from a mango lemonade to a spicy sangria topped with a chilli pepper. Definitely something you don't see a lot. Drinks are quite large as well!

All in all, really cute and hip place to grab a drink or a bite after work but stay here a bit long and your wallet may hate you (because you'll want to eat everything)"}
{"text":"Great location by the lake. We were seated fairly quickly and the waitress was attentive. Food took a very long time to come out of the kitchen. I had the classic burger and fries. Burger itself was good, the meat was of a decent quality although the patty was a bit small. The fries were also to my liking. Overall I would give it another shot, but its not a must-try."}
{"text":"Great location, horrible service, and bad management. 
Line to get on the patio was long while there was numerous empty unbussed tables. 
It took 15 minutes for our server to come over, and when she did she was not friendly. She didn't even introduce herself or apologize for the wait. We anticipated a long wait and ordered food and drinks all at once. 20 minutes later she brought us our drinks, and still no waters. We waited 1 hour for our food, without our server coming over once, and again no apology or explanation for slow service. Food was good and reasonably priced, atmosphere was good, but didn't make up for the bad experience. 
It is my third time here with bad service, and my last."}
{"text":"A perfect example of below average. The only good thing was the proximity to the water. Food was over cooked and underwhelming yet expensive. Service was meh.
Won't return unless for drinks only."}
{"text":"A nice sunny day and you sit by the harbour front and drink some beer and eat some chicken wings. You catch up with friends and let time pass by. Now, that's the kind of place this restaurant is. The food here (wings, burgers, nachos) is nothing extraordinary and the service is okay. You are here because of the ambience. This is easily the best joint next to the harbour front and sometimes there is some wait time to get in there if you specifically want to sit in the patio."}
{"text":"I have to say I loved this place after seeing a video on BlogTO along with everyone else in the city, I decided to be a lemur and follow the trend to the water. 

The outdoor patio is unbelievably relaxing and beautiful, I love being able to sit by the lake and enjoy some drinks and good food. 

The interior was also very modern and was an amazing trip to the loo, maybe next time we will stay inside by one of the roll up doors, on a less sunny day. 

Now I hate 2 person tables, I like to order a lot of food and stretch out when it's just me and my Peanut, we enjoy being able to sit beside or across without the restrictions put on us by society and their mini tables. My only complaint was that the hostess didn't want to give me the table even though it was basically empty at the time, but a quick hello to her manager solved that issue effectively. 

Now their drink menu has some great options for cocktails and sangria which is perfect for by the water, now the real reason you are reading this though is for the food. 

I love burgers and anyone that knows me knows I love burgers so I tried the Elk burger, and don't get all animal activist on me but I need to hunt me some Elk. That was an amazing burger cooked perfectly with a side of Poutine, I liked the beef gravy and they used fresh curds which any good Canadian will tell you is the only way to make it. 

Now my girl she had the Lobster roll with the edamame salad, I think I need to catch me lobster too or is that too much ??? I guess the real question is why don't I move to New Brunswick..... I think I'm getting off topic, it was good, actually it was one of best Lobster rolls I have ever had, and this is a Pub remember... meh! 

You do not need to order a starter we did and we were basically full halfway through, we had the cauliflower bites and yes they are a vegetable in a wing sauce and they were amazing..... I am getting hungry as I write this out..... I think I shall go back...... maybe tonight to enjoy a warm summer evening by the water. 

Go now if you haven't already!!!!"}
{"text":"We were hoping for a fun and leisurely brunch with our kid before the Jays game and were very disappointed. Thank goodness the view was lovely because it took almost an hour for our food to arrive. People seated after us were served well enough before us to finish eating by the time our food arrived. When it did, we were equally disappointed. Our daughter's eggs were well done instead over medium. This wasn't a big deal, however they came with a piece of fuzz and a couple pieces of brown egg shell on top. My pancakes arrived with a big piece of meat sludge between two of them (i.e. fat and grease from some other patron's dish). In addition, our coffee refill never came, our water refill had a mysterious brown speck floating in it, and the waitress mistakenly told my husband they didn't carry the beer he asked for (that was on the menu). The manager came and said simply 'sorry' about the eggs (only) and comped them. This just wasn't enough to convince us to ever eat there again. They don't seem to take much care in the food or the customers."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. it is in a prime location and had a promising appeal to it. I went on Mother's Day so unfortunately we found out after we ordered drinks that on holidays there's a smaller menu. 
Can't go wrong with a burger and fries right?  Wrong. A few bites in and the bun was breaking. The beef patty was dry and tasteless. I only ended up eating the beef patty but with ketchup for flavour. I also had the hand cut fries, which I had asked to be extra crispy. They came out soft. 
Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and a wicked beer selection! The view of the water is awesome and the staff are really friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"This is a five star place for location alone:  waterfront on nearly all sides, inside and out AND a fabulous bar!  (Every beer you could want, 20+ on tap, three different types of sangria, three different bloody Mary's, frozen rose wine drinks for hot patio days, specialty cocktails, etc)
I wouldn't make this one of my dining destinations but the bar food is good.

I had the summer sangria which had a perfect balance of wine and rum, pineapple and lime/mint.. not too sweet.. and it was goblet-sized for $12 and quite strong.  (I couldn't finish it and function a swell as I needed to today!). My friend had one of the mojitos.  We ordered the large soft pretzel spinach/ artichoke dip.  I won't judge them on those appetizers because they're fairly basic and hard to mess up, but I would say that their apps could be much more creative.
They have some interesting things on their menu, like a kale/quinoa superfood salad, a Thai green curry and a zen bowl... and then they have a chicken pot pie.. on the same menu.  Not sure if it's a healthy on trend place or a comfort food joint.  Same with the apps:  loaded nachos, giant pretzel and spinach dip.... but also a California roll, which I actually wanted but was afraid to order here because it didn't seem like a place that could produce sushi.
I would come back just for the atmosphere. And we had great service. And prolly try one of the salads."}
{"text":"Just don't waste your time. Came here with a group of 9 people on a weekday for lunch. The restaurant was barely a quarter full. The service was awful. It took 30 min for the 2 apps we ordered to come (just 2)and almost 1.5 hours for the first entree to arrive. And they brought 2 entrees.... 10 min pass.... Another 2 entrees... Another 15 min pass... One entree... Etc 
It was just a terrible experience. And the food we waited so long for? Not even good. The fries taste like fries made yesterday and reheated (no crisp, not soft in the middle just bad), the crispy chicken sandwich - the chicken like fell out of the breading after the first bite and was pretty bland. Bland was the general consensus  from my table. Someone had the burger and said it was dry, someone else got the surf and turf burger and the \"lobster claw\" looking like cat food. The salad was under dressed... I could go on...  There are better restos in the area."}
{"text":"This location was formerly (not 'fomally' - not.everyone.should.write.especially.if.you.no.no.English') Watermark irish Pub. With that business gone the beautiful location by the water, the standard-issue menu and the dumpster blocking the view remain. Gone is the attitude and care-free service.
We were at The Goodman today, which is owned by the FAB folk who also own the Brunswick and have renamed this property, and enjoyed the view for half our stay. The Toronto Harbour boats anchor in front and that is all you see while they are there, but once they depart one can see the water and Toronto Island, which is a treat. The Porter Airlines planes also take flight and land. Speaking of which, the place can get loud. Between the patrons sound bouncing off the glass walls, the boats ringing bells and blowing horns and the passers-by this is a db nightmare. On the down side, the dumpster that calls the pavement home is still there.
The food is what it is. Of course, it is overpriced, but that goes literally with the territory. Hamburgers, salad, poutine all-day breakfast, etc. are norms of the day. The hamburger was meh, the poutine was above average, especially for a establishment like this, and the Eggs Benedict on croissant was also OK. In a nod to Canadiana - did I already mention poutine? - they have an Elk Burger. 
There is a varied drinks' menu as well.
The service is where they shine. The waiters and waitresses are friendly, smile and make canned small talk. They are happy to accommodate you and are not averse to listen to you or accommodate personalizations. Our waiter was a bubbly young man with a personality and long on recommendations. Kudos to him for his friendliness, but never choking us with attention. They even had a bowl for dogs at the door for our canine friends to quench their thirst. Well done. The waitstaff seemed uniformly nice, but they all were doing their own thing (i.e. jeans, pants, shorts, skirts at will). As well, look no other way to say it but no one wants to see cellulite while eating and nothing says 'trashy' like tattoos. Cover those up please. If you are unhappy with yourself and have body issues just cover them up when working so I don't have to be exposed to them.

The restaurant has a great location, within easy walking distance of my hotel ( Westin) Had the poutine and the Elk burger both of which were amazing.

{"text":"I came here with my family before heading to a Jays game and were seated at a table on the patio with water views on two sides looking out to the Island. It was beautiful! We had brunch and the pancakes with white chocolate and strawberries were pretty epic! Our server, Hayley, made the experience even better. She treated us so well and was perfectly attentive. Starting the day with such fantastic service, delicious food and amazing views made it a little easier to handle when the Jays had a painful loss."}

patiently explained the menu items and checked with the chef to get a couple of additional questions asked.

The super food salad was tasty and filling. The wings were a spicy surprise."}
{"text":"Very low quality food. This might be an ok place for drinks but definitely not for food. We had the fried chicken sandwich which was below average and we got the Zen bowl that was extremely salty. When we told our server, she said that the dish is supposed to be very salty!!!!
We all came home feeling unsatisfied, heavy, and we all agreed that we would never go back again!"}
