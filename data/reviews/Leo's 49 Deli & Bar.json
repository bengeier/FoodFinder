{"text":"Only open for three months, it was empty and we were skeptical.  Sat down, ate, drank, talked and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Shouldn't be empty.  Food is amazing, clean and inviting environment and super friendly staff.  If we were locals, we'd be here all the time.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Darryl best manager ever- such a great time in an awesome environment, the bartender nick and waitress Megan were great, but the bartender Nathan truly was the Leo experience!"}
{"text":"Good location close to the university area with very reasonably priced food and good portions. I've waited for something to open hear since my freshman year and this has been exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"So good I forgot to take a picture!! The chicken tenders with sweet chili sauce are amazing! Great drink specials and friendly staff. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great \"new\" addition to this area! Wings were great and fries were twice fried- so delicious. Menu was big so we'll definitely be back to try other options. Finally may have found a new local after 5 years!"}
{"text":"Gouda mac'n cheese bites were amazing! Juiciest burger that I've had in a long time add a side of tator tots with beer cheese...heaven! They've only been open for three weeks and already I'm hooked on this place. Definitely don't miss out on this spot!"}
{"text":"There was nobody inside so it was super quiet and I wasn't expecting much, but the food was SO GOOD. The inside is also newly renovated and looks awesome. This place is huge and has a bunch of seating. I ordered with a friend and we split our entrees so I tried the boneless wings and the chicken philly. Wings are the best I've had in the area. Philly good too but nothing special, just normal! Sweet potato fries also super yummy. Will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Fantastic service!  Clean! Menu has great variety as well!!!!    Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome new bar and restaurant. It's been a long time coming - they've been renovating this space for a long time - and the wait was worth it!  The building looks brand new, inside and out. The menu focuses on your standard bar fare - appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and wings. I had the hot corned beef sandwich with hot mustard served on rye bread. The sandwich was huge - the corned beef was piled high - and did not disappoint. My friend had the \"Leo's Special\" sandwich which had salami, bologna, corned beef, pastrami and swiss cheese. Let me just tell you, Wow! I think I've found my new neighborhood hang-out. Oh, and the vintage looking painting of a Chef that faces you when you walk in the front door? Apparently, that's Leo."}
