{"text":"Disappointed. Beer choices unusual and not very good. In addition at 3 PM on a weekday they were out of 2 brews. Same with lunch menu. Out of fish and chips and sausage sampler. Bangers and mash good but nothing to rave about. Beef brisket had no flavor and was fatty. Beef tasted like it was boiled with no seasoning. Service slow and inattentive. No plans to go back."}
{"text":"The experience was awful as soon as the snooty disrespectful hostesses met us at the door.  We walked in at 3:45 and they weren't sure they could seat us because we didn't have reservations.  There were more empty tables than there was patrons.  They finally seated us upstairs witch was also as vacant as the downstairs.  After waiting several minutes for a server the table next to us was seated and promptly severed and drink orders were taken. We waited a bit longer and decided to leave when nobody came to are table.  I would suggest some smiling wait staff and pleasant hosts.  Very rude place."}
{"text":"Really cool place.  Wish they had a few more guest beer selections but had a nice IPA while we were there.  Food was good, prices are very fair, service was average."}
{"text":"Awesome place,  great food,  great atmosphere. Our waiter was so professional.  Tyne party we had was aMAZING"}
{"text":"This place is GORGEOUS! great drinks, perfect service. Thank you, Mariah, for being so sweet to us! Thanks to Zach (\"Barry\") for adding comedy to our Sunday Funday ;) We will definitely be back!

{"text":"Very kid friendly!! They have cute high chairs and a big kids menu and even make their own baby food! Kids menu had local food and even several organic meals. They made me feel comfortable being in such a nice restaurant with a messy pig haha."}
{"text":"Fried chicken sandwich beats SOHO's in Ohio City. Cuban was so-so. Kid friendly. Love the patio. New go-to in DTW."}
{"text":"Good Food....Awful Service/Management. Went for Sunday Brunch- and the disappointment started immediately at the hostess stand. We were greated with what seemed like annoyance instead of a welcoming smile. When seated, we were approached by who we assumed was the server with a pitcher of water but never asked if we would like a drink or told her name (still couldn't tell you the servers name). Good Bloody Mary and Decent beer even though it wasnt the one we asked for. Ordered food and there was cereal on the menu which my daughter oddly requested and everyone likes a happy kid at brunch...asked for it as an appetizer to keep her smiling until food came. 15 minutes after the order was in-we were told they were out of milk and they had to go get some. That is ok, and understandable (even though its silly it took 15 minutes to realize they were out). Then our food came out one entree at a time-making the first plate cold by the time the last plate was delivered. Apparently the server sensed the frustration and got the manager who awkwardly approached the table never saying his name or who he was...just apologized and assured the cereal would be \"on him\". Food was still delicious nonetheless. The kitchen knows what they are doing. As we were finishing our food (forgot to mention 3 seperate times we had empty water glasses for over 5 minutes)...the cereal finally came out and we were told \"dont worry we wont charge you for it\" and didnt see the server or manager again-Until the nameless server quickly dropped the check and ran away. I understand things get overlooked, and restaurants run out of things....and we wouldn't have been so disappointed with the experience if we were \"wow-ed\" by a friendly staff to compliment the great food. I think the only way I would return is for carryout. A smile/friendly attutude goes a long way...especially when you are enjoying a good meal!"}
{"text":"It's a new, shiny restaurant in Willoughby. I'm still trying to decide if the management is justifying the cost of the food to pay off the interior decorator, or keep out the riff-raff. Then again, maybe I was peeved the only table they had available was right next to the bathrooms...

Let me start with the $14 dollar pretzel \"appetizer\", and \"brisket sandwich\" that while tastey, came smothered in a cheese sauce that reminded me of something from Arby's that you had to chew your way through. The craft beer they made there was passable, but suffering from the same problem of having an overwhelming abundance of India Piss Ales. If you make your own IPA on site, why sell 4 more IPA'S from different breweries?

The menu was equally confusing combining a weird combination of popular pub grub with equally overpriced entrees.

Staff was friendly, attentive, so kudos to them. 

This place has some kinks to work out, but has potential. End of the day, worth checking out, if overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Very great staff, good food and menu! Beautiful new and comfortable building! Been there four times since they opened just a few weeks ago. Definitely will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"There is an incredible amount of potential here but the menu needs a lot of work.  

Stopped in earlier in the week for lunch.  The service was fantastic considering they just opened and the few of their beers we had were good but not great.  

Before I get to the food itself, the number of menus we were given was unecessary at best and confusing at worst. Food menu with front and back, specials menu, beer list, and a cocktail list with a seperate  (outdated) beer list on the back covered in fine print options.  Four menus with a contradictory beer list is a little overwhelming.  I understand that printing new beer lists is expensive every time the drafts change but it's better than presenting guests with a seperate updated list.

The food itself was a little disappointing considering the chefs previous work with Pub Frato.  The brisket in the Fork and Knife Brisket sandwich was so finely chopped it was mush, and the cheese fondue it was topped with didn't help.  The whole sandwich had the same texture as mashed potatoes on a bun.  It tasted okay (just okay) but I didn't expect a brisket sandwich to look like it had been served with a ladel.  

My wife ordered the braised portobello sandwich.  While it's a very vegetarian friendly menu, the sandwich itself was just.... food.  It was good but not great.  If you go to Ocharleys and order a Philly cheese steak without the meat, you get the exact same sandwich. 

I read in an article that the owners wanted to make sure their place didn't come off too pretentious in the blue collar Willoughby.  While it's a smart thing to be aware of, serving the fries in an overturned paper cup on Brim monogrammed plates is a silly misstep.  It doesn't make the plate more approachable, it just looks out of place.

Overall it's a lovely building and a great addition to downtown Willoughby.  With a little tweaking to the food and presentation, it will be a place my wife and I will be excited to frequent."}
{"text":"What a forgettable night. If only I could. Don't bother coming here, the beer is marginal and the service is awful. The manager promised us a gift card but that never materialized. If you make the mistake of coming here get the pretzel, but be prepared to wait an hour for it with nothing to drink."}
{"text":"I've have been here a couple of times this far and have been quiet impressed with the their offerings. 

They have a great beer selection including guest taps and their own brews. The fuzzy peach ale is AWESOME. A very refreshing beer full of flavor. 

I have had their mushroom cheese steak sandwich as well as the grilled cheese BLT. Both were good but did not blow my mind by any means. 

The atmosphere is really great. The building is beautiful, and the service is great. 

I'm happy to have another brewery local to willougjby!"}
{"text":"Wow the waitress was terrible took forever to get my food and of course it was cold and gross.. wine was disgusting.."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my family to Brim for Mother's Day dinner.  We arrived around 5pm.  You know the saying about first impressions?  The hostesses were not outgoing - especially the one with the short hair, she oozed attitude.  After some deliberation, we were seated and then shortly after greeted by our server Alisha.  

Neither me or my dad cared for her attitude and tone.  She advised they were out of the pretzel appetizer.  Tip one - it's not like Mother's Day was a surprise.  You knew it was coming and it would be busy, so order more.  They were also out of a beer my husband wanted to try.  See tip one.  Most restaurants bring some bread or chips, but not this place.  Might be something to consider.  

Each item on the menu has something in it that none of knew what it was.  Alisha didn't know what it was either.  She asked if I wanted her to find out.  Seriously...??? Tip two - you are working there so how about you know what is on the menu. 

Dinner arrived not too terribly long after ordering and this takes us to tip three.  Tip three - the food should be hot.  At best, the bangers and mash was luke warm and ditto for the French onion soup.  The Caesar salad was basically a head of anemic romaine lettuce cut in half with some dressing drizzled over it.  Hardly worth $9.

Disappointing from start to finish.  So our first visit to Brim will be our last."}
{"text":"Overall, I was not impressed with the food or drinks. If you are into Brussel sprouts and beet purée then give this place a shot. 
Highlights 
-promptly seated 
-great beer selection (they brew their own too)
-chips and dips was really good (minus beet purée)

Contours
-cocktails were terrible! Thought I would try out the watermelon one and asked the waitress to exchange it for something else. Brought me an equally, If not worse cocktail. I lied and said I liked it, because I don't want to be \"that\" person. She charged me for both drinks even though she took the first one away. If I had to pay for it, at least let another member of my party drink it. I'm sure someone would have choked it down.
- pot roast melt was bland, fatty, and dry. It needed more juice and better cuts of meat!"}
{"text":"The drinks here are amazing...love the Bloody Mary and the Dirty Martini...and every time I have asked for extra olives, I get lots!!!

The food here is delicious...love the ...need to be more generous with the tomatoes...but yum! My husband had the lentil soup and my son had the burger - clean"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Great to get more upscale new-American style restaurants on the East Side.  Beer was very good for the styles that they made (stout, Belgian ale, pale ale), but I'm more of a craft pilsner guy, so none of them were my type.  Service was average to below average, but they've been open for less than a week, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

The quality of the food is the only reason I didn't rate it one star higher (I only give out 5 stars for truly exceptional places).  I ordered the knife & fork brisket sandwich with a truffle fries upgrade.  The brisket did not pass my bite test because it was not tender enough (gristly and tough) to easily bite through without all of the meat coming out of the bun.  If theyre gonna do a brisket sandwich it MUST pass the bite test, but maybe that's why they call it the \"knife & fork\" sandwich.  The flavor of the sandwich was very good despite the chewy meat. The truffle fries were good, if a little cold, but they tasted very similar to Pub Frato's truffle fries (also good) all the way down to the aioli.  My wife got the Vietnamese Rice Noodles with tofu and loved it.

I think we'll return in the future to check out the cool rooftop patio during warmer weather and see if they ironed out the the issues outlined above."}
{"text":"We stopped at BRIM for lunch on the way back from Cleveland. We are not from the area and thought it looked interesting. 

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and a bevy of servers just standing behind the hostess station.  The hostess asked us if there was something she could help us with. Not your normal greeting to diners. Talk about making us feel awkward and out of place.  We were seated at a small two seater table in the front of the restaurant.  The tables are much to small.  There was barely room for our drinks and silverware. Definitely felt cramped. 

My hubby had the Patty Melt which was a good size and he said was very good. I had the mac n cheese with steak. The mac n cheese was dry and the steak had been hard seared so the outside had a burnt crust. Not to my liking.  Overall I was disappointed with my meal. 
We both had the French Onion soup and it was pretty good. 

Our lunch was $60 for tip. The pricing isn't for the weak of heart. The food was decent but definitely not worth the $60 we paid."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Willoughby brewery scene. My personal favorite is their unique take on beers. The \"red-x IPA\" is a unique combination of hops and malt, and my personal favorite beer. The burger is a solid choice and the atmosphere is second to none in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Sterile atmosphere. WAY TOO LOUD making it impossible to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I had the vegan burger with a side of veggies. No, I'm not a vegan but just need something on the healthier, less heavy side since I was traveling for work. I love my meat but this burger was pretty good. Didn't really care for the side of veggies though. It was a bit on the tough side, felt under-cooked. However, all my co-workers ordered their fried chicken burger and loved it. It visually looked pretty tasty. They had a decent variety of beers too. Even more than the food it, I liked the atmosphere and ambiance. It had a contemporary feel, and it wasn't too loud so good for chatting with friends. This place was also located in a cute, downtown area with antique shops and such. Also, the price point was great! Cool spot to hang out. Overall, I'd come again."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. They have awesome brews and the food was super dank. Staff was competent and attractive."}
{"text":"Nice vibe; decent place to meet for a casual bite and to hang out with friends.  Acoustics can be challenging, so fair warning to anyone with hearing issues.  Quality of food varies, but overall, I've had good experiences dining at BRIM."}
{"text":"I always want to like a new place but that's not always the case. This place was packed on a Tuesday night which was awesome to see! I got here around 5pm and was able to get a seat at the bar. This new brewery only has 4 of their own beers on tap and they were just okay. With so many new breweries opening up, I think the beer needs to be stellar to compete with every other place. 

The food was just so-so as well. I ordered the Frito Pie and it was out within (literally) two minutes. It was a slight disappointment because it seemed like it was already prepared waiting for someone to order it. Also, I was thinking that while i was reading the description of Frito Pie that it would come out in such a way that it would be layered with fritos...there were about 6 fritos on top of what was a bowl of chili. We had to actually order more fritos! I also ordered the French Onion Soup was actually the best thing of the night that I tried. 

I will try Brim again but I will wait until this brewery has been open for awhile to see if the menu/experience is any better."}
{"text":"We had a private wedding reception at Brim last night.  Not only was the food excellent.....but the service was amazing .....i cannot say enough about the whole experience.  Than you to the amazing service staff and the chef....."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always had a good experience. Atmosphere is one of the best in town. And the food is tasty and reasonably priced. Confused as to why it has lower reviews on yelp as, to me, it one of the best new restaurants on the east side. I'm a resident of Eastlake and we are extremely lucky to have Brim in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have visited BRIM two times both on Friday and have not been disappointed yet. Modern building, a wide variety of food offerings and some great beers brewed in-house.

The location is probably the newest building in downtown willoughby, featuring  an upstairs and downstairs bar and an upstairs patio. The brewery is visible from the downstairs bar. They offer mainly their own brews and have 10 on tap at any given time plus two rotating taps. Their febluearry is one of the best fruit ales around and very strong, but you can't go wrong with a Mr. Kringle or Birthday Brew either. 

Friday is a BBQ night that features brisket, ribs and Cajun fries, which everyone around me kept ordering and loving. We opted for the Brussel sprouts, fried chicken sandwich and a side of mac n cheese, which put me in delicious food coma hours later. They give you a ton of crispy sprouts and the goat cheese with balsamic always pairs well with bacon. The fries chicken sandwich was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, but the pickles really made it for me. The side of mac n cheese was a meal itself but was too tasty to take home in a doggy bag.

We need to come back on Tuesday for the teriyaki chicken and shrimp dumpling night! They have something for everyone and are always well staffed. Stop by for a micro brew and filling food to pregame before a night out."}
{"text":"The food that we ate was fantastic.  The fish and chips were quite tasty and I had the BRIM burger with a side a Beet and Blue salad- all I can say is WOW. The burger was one of the best burgers I've had along with the salad. Service was good and everyone was friendly and attentive. A definite going back."}
{"text":"My mother has been telling me to visit this restaurant ever since it opened, but I never did because... well, because it's my mom. After visiting last Saturday, I actually had to apologize to her for not following this recommendation from the very beginning! It was an amazing experience, from the beer and the food to the service. 

I made a reservation the day before, since I knew it would probably get busy on a Saturday night. I was glad that I did, since it was pretty busy and the couple in front of us was still waiting. I ordered the Febluelarry beer, and it was surprisingly better than Fathead's Bumbleberry. It's a lot less carbonated than Bumbleberry and less tart than many blueberry ciders. The beer prices are also great! 

The appetizers looked really good, but we just went ahead and ordered entrees. I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and substituted the sauerkraut for vegetables, as I am allergic to cabbage. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries. When the food came out (it was a bit of a wait, but not nearly as long as many other restaurants), my plate had sauerkraut and my boyfriend was given the veggies instead of fries. We immediately alerted the server, who had the entire thing corrected in about 5 minutes. He was really great, and I have not seen such service in a really long time. 

The schnitzel was fantastic - the breadcrumbs were well seasoned and it was fried to the perfect brown! It's so hard to get the right texture on cutlets and schnitzel, and even German restaurants struggle sometimes. This one, however, was the best. The pierogis were probably the best that I have ever eaten, and I'm a huge pierogi maniac. They were dense, but not overwhelming, and the edges were crispy and delicious. My favorite part, however, were the vegetables. I asked my boyfriend if they had crack in it - they were that good! It was the best veggie variety I had ever seen at a restaurant, and they tasted better than any veggies I had ever eaten. I'm kinda craving it right now, actually. 

When we left, I had forgotten my keys in the restaurant. As soon as I said \"wait, where are my keys?,\" we saw the waiter running into the parking lot holding them. It was raining! 

I will absolutely go back for any occasion - date night, apology dinner for my mom, party, girls night.. it was just an incredible experience."}
{"text":"Went in on opening day ! Staff was very friendly and helpful, I asked quite a few questions and got some valuable feed back so I could choose what I thought I would like best. I Was a little surprised to only see 4 draft beers from the brewery itself, but the 2 I had were delicious. No IPA, although the Primus Pallidus Pale was quite hoppy and refreshing. Will definitely be back to try more food/brews."}
{"text":"Brim is looking grim!  Came in with high hopes even with the mixed reviews and was looking to be impressed by this new place. The experience started out good, we were promptly greeted and seated when we came in on Monday for lunch. We asked to be seated on their second floor patio. We were seated and only waited maybe 2 minutes to order and get drinks, not bad. We ordered our 2 appetizers, the pretzel and dips and the buratta eggplant caponata which took about 30 min to get. The pretzel and dip was nothing to write home about, the burratta on the other hand was amazing. It was fresh and the flavor of the sweet caponata and acidity of the balsamic and pesto cut the richness of the cheese which was brightened up by the blistered cherry tomatoes.

After our appetizers, everything went down hill quickly. I ordered the short rib gnocchi and my wife ordered the brisket patty melt. My entree was supposed to have blue cheese, wild mushrooms, caponata, olives and grana padano cheese. My dish had zero blue cheese and there were no wild mushhrooms to be found. Instead I received over-cooked, dry gnocchi, some clumps of what looked like frozen spinach from a package and the dish really only tasted like salt and butter. As for my wife's \"patty melt\" (which is not a patty at all) it was sliced brisket over a piece of cheese on two decent sized pieces of toasted bread with a small smear or horseradish sauce (honestly couldnt even taste it!) and it came with fries. It looked good at first glance although there were just a few mushrooms and onions stuck on top. The side of fries when eaten without beer cheese dip or the mustard sauce (since we could not get ketchup because our waiter vanished) tasted like the freezer fries you get at a grocery store and were not fully cooked (no crisp!). The sandwich itself was not special and quite greasy, you could just get a similar sandwich at Arby's for much cheaper!!!

To conclude, the service went from ok to none as after we received our main meals, we were not checked in on at all. My wife sat with an empty glass of water and soda for the last half our meal (waiter never asked if she even wanted a refill) and I ran out of water and finished my last beer before the waiter finally came over about 20 minutes after we had finished our meal and drinks to see if we needed anything else. By which point we were so disappointed we already had our card out to pay. Not to mention while all this was going on a young female that appeared to be a manager or something sat at the bar right inside the patio door on her laptop while the wait staff appeared to try to entertain her and not once greeted customers or came to see how peoples meals were. This is tops in my worst dining experiences - I hope they can get things together while they still can but until i
I see improved, consistent reviews we will not be returning or recommending Brim!!"}
{"text":"I was actually a little apprehensive based on some other reviews on Yelp, but we had a gift card from Christmas and were very impressed all around. 

We came for happy hour on a weeknight, so parking behind BRIM was plentiful and we were seated quickly and had prompt service. 

The $8 burger and a beer happy hour special was great considering the burger was just right. The double patties were thin, so it wasn't overwhelming, and the burger was juicy and very tasty. You can add fries to the order for $2 but we split a $5 plate of parmesan fries that were very good and enough for two people to share. 

Good kids menu for the little ones, too. We got a quessadila, which was more than enough for leftovers and a side of applesauce that was generous to say the least.

The prices were kinda high for regular dining - $12 burgers is not something I do too often when I have Fresh & Tasty burgers and fries down the street in Cleveland Heights for $7 - but you get quality food and happy hour makes this somewhere I'd gladly come back!"}
{"text":"Our server, Jason, was the best server I've had in a long time. Our drinks were always full, he had the kitchen make me something that used to be on the menu but no longer is. (Ps bring back the grilled cheese) he was very attentive but not over bearing and just plain nice. We had a table of 8 with no reservations on a Saturday night and they accommodated us perfectly. Not one person in the group had a complaint. Thanks Jason for a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Went to Brim on a weeknight and it was surprisingly empty. We ordered a couple beers, which were really good. I am normally not a fan of Brussel sprouts but my boyfriend talked me into the appetizer and holy smokes it was so good! He enjoyed his fried chicken and my pasta special was amazing. Will definitely be going back. Our server was great too, didn't bother us but made sure she was around if we needed anything. Great job Brim!"}
{"text":"The building that they built is just absolutely amazing. I just kind of thought the experience would be better. Not saying that anything was bad or under par. Just wasn't wowed by anything besides the building. Food was good but not great. Was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right. Service was good and attentive but that should be expected. I will probably go back but its not on my must do list."}
{"text":"So I was concerned bc no really good reviews. Came here for birthday party. Had lots of apps. The brisket pierogies were outstanding. Pretzel was awesome. Had bangers and mash for dinner. Great. Had an IPA that was good. So maybe kinks have gotten worked out I was happy with everything.  Our server was Val and she did so good. Kept up and was so personable."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. 3-6pm M-F. For $8 you can get an amazing burger and a beer. Frites were only $5 and enough for 2 to share. Pumpkin beer is closer to a Christmas beer and is excellent. Good kid menu as well. Friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"I was filled to the \"Brim\" with joy while trying out their beer and food for the first time. Every beer was delicious including their light beer. I usually skip even trying the craft beer lights because they usually are so watered down and lack taste. But Brim's light had a very crisp light flavor that was so pleasing. Our pretzel appetizer was delectable including both the beer cheese and honey mustard dips. One of my downfalls is that I love French fries and Brim's fries are perfect. We will definitely be back to visit again and sit on their awesome patio."}
{"text":"Keyword for Brim: Trendy. Almost painfully so. The custom built space is nice, big and open. Outside patio was heated and looked swanky as well. The two floors feature bars on both levels serving all kinds of unique brews. And like the building the staff is still new, but attentive and kind. Our waitress actually compliment several patrons on the boots and blouses.

The menu will immediately remind you of Ballantine in its presentation and way it reads. And honestly, some of thr dishes could swap out at either location. Though I will say, in the end, the food at Ballentine is better. Diner #1 had Mac and Cheese with Salmon and a tap root beer. He liked his meal and said he'd come again. Salmon was cooked well and the cheese for the Mac seemed freshly made. Diner #2 had Bangers and Mash. She enjoyed it, but it wasn't necessarily anything special in terms of flavor. Mash is mash... and the Bangers were okay. She had a Fuzzy Peach Alex that was good enough to finish, but not refill. Diner #3 ordered Crispy Pork Shank. He didn't expect an \"assemble it yourself\" plate based on the description though the presentation WAS very cool. In the end, he enjoyed it very much saying the pork was tasty and crispy, but the pickled veggies were about 50/50 on edibility. Lastly, I had a Polish Boy. The kielbasa was flavored well, but the kraut had zero flavor and I suspect was from a can. And my bun DEFINITELY was not made to support all that food. VERY MESSY. I would not order again. Our appetizer was Montreal Poutine, with two thumbs down from our life-long Canadian resident. And dessert was peanut butter ice cream with grape coulis and peanut butter cookies. Cute presentation and subtle flavor... we ended up going to Malley's for a proper dessert.

So in the end, if you're looking for a trendy patio spot with lots of unique beer choices then you've found your place. If you want a unique dining experience with great food... go down the street to Ballantine. If I was hipster, I'd come again. But alas, I have no man-bun and don't own skinny jeans."}
{"text":"This is brand new Craft Brewery & Restaurant that has been open just a few weeks. I always like to visit newer establishments at off-peak times to better judge the service which is what I did stopping by at 2 PM on a Wednesday. There were five house beers on tap and several guest brew. The bartender was very knowledgeable & friendly explaining the different styles that were available. I had the sampler and enjoyed the IPA & the Red Ale. I also ordered the Vietnamese Rice Noodles, which arrived in less than ten minutes. The salad was fresh, and very nicely prepared. The menu seems somewhat upscale and pricey, I would like to see more small plates offered, particularly vegetarian, however, there is something for everyone on the menu. The building itself is a beautiful contemporary style, custom built with two floors, a full bar upstairs & down, an elevator, huge windows, tall ceilings, exposed rafters, and a lovely outdoor patio. This is definitely a destination Brewery & Restaurant that I highly recommend. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The patio was very nice, and initially the waitress was attentive to us. I was happy to go with my friend who is affiliated with harmony yoga and talked up the place. Unfortunately, once we got our drinks the waitress forgot about us. It was so obvious she wasn't coming back to check to see if we were ready with our food order so after 30 min of being ignored we decided to pay out our drink tab at the bar. A very disappointing experience for sure."}
{"text":"Our group visited Brim after our escape room team builder.

The building is simply gorgeous, inside and out. The smells make you hungry, and the open kitchen make your mouth water.

All of the orders at our table were lovely looking, and smelled wonderful. The food was all good. I really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts. 

I felt that the prices were a tad high for some items, but not too far out of line. 

I have had one of their beers at Fat Head's, and was going to try another option while I was there. So far, I've tried the Erie Street IPA, and a stout that I cannot recall the name. Neither were that memorable, frankly. 

All in all...the menu is nice, the food is tasty, but as a brewery, I'd expect better beer."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. We had our company Christmas party last night at Brim for over 40 guests and they did not disappoint. 

We wanted heavy appetizers that people could eat while standing and visiting. Chef Nick Frate saw our vision come to fruition with a variety of sliders, quesadillas, brisket topped pierogies, an awesome cheese platter and an amazing tiramisu that was made in house. 

The service by our server Bobby was impeccable and made sure our glasses were always full with the phenomenal selection of wines, liquor and amazing beer that they brew in house. 

The staff at Brim also made sure that we had a long high top table available later on in the evening for a gift exchange. Everyone from the bartender, server, hostess and bus boys made our group feel extra special. They really take their motto of \"Full Glass, Full Plate and Full Heart\" serious.

We have already booked again for next year. Awesome job all around and an amazing addition to the Willoughby area."}
{"text":"The service was awful.  Took her 10 minutes after we sat down to come over and get our drink order.  We wanted to stay and drink but decided to go somewhere else.  We rarely saw her and she wasn't friendly when she was at our table.  The food was good.  I want to go back and try again."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Everything we tried was delicious and the atmosphere and decor are beautiful"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad thing at Brim! The atmosphere is so eclectic, workers are super friendly and attentive and the food is absolutely phenomenal. Slightly pricey but worth it in my opinion. The salmon burger special I had last time I went was phenomenal and fries are amazing. Is definitely in my top 5 favorite CLE-area restaurants."}
{"text":"My motto if it has a fancy building the foods probably mediocre .I had the chicken sandwich, fried chicken on a regular bun with cabbage and cucumber, over it was spilled franks hot sauce. Kind of messy, fries soggy not really good. My gf had the avocado sandwich with tomato, egg on whole grain bread... Overall atmosphere is nice. That's about it :-/. 

I write to improve not to harm.

{"text":"Went to Brimm Sat night 6/30...we have been many times. Favorite menu item is the Truffle Fries app. First, I'm not sure what happened to the menu. It seems to be about half what it once was. The truffle fries came in a tiny cup, with some sauce drizzled in the bottom. We used to get a nice size platter. Very disappointing. I didn't even check to see how much they charged- but half the size, and unappealing display. The brussel sprouts did not disappoint- very delicious as always..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. Food and beer menus offer a huge variety. Management seems very committed to keeping customers happy. They have been packed the few times I've been there and the staff handles the crowd flawlessly. This is a great addition to the downtown Willoughby area. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really good honest food with delightful Staff. Different kind of feeling if that makes sense. First visit you feel like a regular, like your coming home.

I'll follow up with additional details on the meal however until then just know that it was really good."}
{"text":"While the space and atmosphere is totally promising, you'd better have 3 hours set aside for a meal. The customer service is absolutely atrocious, and may actually be the worst I've ever encountered. The first time we went, our waiter insisted on pointing out the clause where substituting sides was an up charge, even after we had already agreed and said we understood, AND put the card in to pay. 

Determined to give the dinner hour a try, my boyfriend and I went back around 7:45 on a weeknight. After being smushed in between two other tables with a fairly empty restaurant, we then waited over 20 minutes without water or acknowledgment from a waitress. We just got up and left, while the staff continued to chat amongst themselves near the bar. 

For a restaurant/brewery with great promise, it was utterly disappointing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit.  We reserved a table for two and ended up in a corner by the bar.  This would have been fine, if it weren't for a party of 15 that were also in the same corner.  There was barely enough room to walk between the bar and our table, so we kept getting bumped.   We asked to be moved to one of the many empty tables, and were told it was not possible.  Left without eating.  Don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 3.5 and 4 star rating.  This was my first visit to BRIM. Super cool space.  I arrived during Sunday Brunch, and opted to sit at the bar, since I was dining by myself.  I ordered the veggie quinoa ($14), add shrimp ($5).   I thought the price point was a little bit high for quinoa, seeing as though I could have gotten a burger and fries for about $12, but didn't really see anything else on the menu that I had a taste for.  My entree arrived a short time later, and just as I expected, the portion was small, but adequate, and way over-priced at $19.  I would suggest, a side of mixed greens perhaps, to accompany the entree.  After seeing the portion, I ordered a side of sourdough toast ($3), which was very good.  Now back to the entree, decent portion of warm, white quinoa, with seasonal vegetables which included, LOTS of zuchhini, a few mushrooms, some onion.  There were also cranberries mixed in, I could have done without the sweet component, just didn't need it.  I also would have loved a larger variety of veggies, maybe some carrots, sundried tomatoes, broccolli, or cauliflower.  The entree was tasty, but my final bill was close to $30 with tip and the only beverage that I had was ice water.  I would return, but would absolutely order something else, or return outside of Brunch to order other options."}
{"text":"BRIM is hands down my favorite spot in downtown Willoughby and possibly in the Northeast area. My wife and I have been here several times for lunch and dinner . We have been by ourselves and also with our daughter so it's great for kids. 
We also just had a surprise 40th Birthday for my wife in the upstairs Bar area and it was incredible. I highly recommend booking this for your next large group event. 

The food is awesome and the menu has a great selection but not overwhelming. The craft beers they brew are fantastic and I recommend tasting them all they are true masters at their craft! There is a great wine selection for the wine drinkers as well if you aren't a fan of beer. 

Parking is a breeze here because unlike most downtown Willoughby spots they have their own lot and the lot next door you can use. 

The staff is awesome from the time you walk in and they are on top of everything while dining . The kitchen chefs and staff are top notch and they put on an awesome spread of food I haven't had anything I didn't love! 

I highly recommend BRIM for just a night out for dinner or maybe even lunch but most definitely your next party !! You will not be disappointed! 

Thanks for everything BRIM Staff your guys are awesome !"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Brim. The first time we had some appetizers drinks (cucumber claw is so delicious and refreshing!) and dinner. I had the Veggie Quinoa bowl and added Salmon... super salty.  So overpowered by salt I cld not enjoy. 2nd time there, I had the Salmon dinner as did a friend. Both of our Salmon pieces were completely charred, no flavor. Our sides that came with it, no flavor. And the size if the salmon filet was 1/2 that of our other friend who order Veggie Quinoa bowl and added Salmon. My husband had the Bolognese... first bight scrumptious.... then way over powered by salt. Horrible. The ambiance is great, service was great, appetizers good but meals disappointing both times.  Will not be back to eat."}
{"text":"Brim is by far the best addition to downtown Willoughby. It's got so much more then the other local places. They really put a lot of time and hard work into this place. 
For starters the inside and decor is awesome . There are two bars, one upstairs and one downstairs . It has an outside rooftop patio which no other restaurant can compete with. (I believe unless you go downtown no other place has one in are area) This is going to be an amazing spot for the summer. When we dined her on Saturday night they did have the doors open to the patio and the fireplace on. It was perfect to sit by the fireplace and enjoy a drink. 
Next, the food was beyond amazing. This is our third time here and each time we haven't been disappointed. I do not know who the chef is but kudos to him for the delicious and tasty food. 
Being in Cleveland the list for restaurant with healthy options is scarce , now healthy and vegan that's unheard of. The one item on this menu that caught my eye is the veggie burger on the vegan bun. The best veggie burger I have ever had. It was not dry at all with lots of flavor. 
My husband had the butcher steak. It was perfectly and evenly cooked to my husbands liking. My husband travels a lot and eats at some of the top restaurants around the world and he stated his steak was amazing. This is hard to do , please my husband with a well cooked quality steak. Well done BRIM, well done ! 
We did also split a salad which was amazing but I don't think many people want to hear how delicious my salad was. 
We can't wait for our next date night to BRIM !"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. The waiters and Evan especially are on top of their game and the restaurant itself is stunning. Recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"They get a 3 only because they process their own beer supposedly. Otherwise I would have given them a two. As far as the food goes it's slightly higher than standard bar food, nothing special. The atmosphere and cleanliness was spot-on. Ordered their $21 short ribs it was nothing special and not impressed."}
{"text":"Always a solid good meal and service. 
Been here a few times and never been disappointed. 
On our regular rotation of go to restaurants in the Lake County area."}
{"text":"Heard good things so we decided to check BRIM out with another couple.  Started strong- seated quickly with our reservation, starters were tasty (we had the pretzel and pierogies)- but the experience slipped a little after that.  My husband and friend ordered prime rib, after all meals were served theirs came over cooked.  We were then told they sold out so while two of us had dinner, two sat without food. They apologized and got a round of drinks to make it up to us.  They ordered the short ribs which were fantastic, while my gnocchi wasn't traditional it was alright bit slightly disappointing.  The sundae that came as a paired dessert had cayenne pepper on it- which was alright but for those that don't like heat- a warning from the server would have been appreciated.  Service was average- we had to flag her down for drink refills and weren't checked in on much except by the manager after the meal mishap.  We'll give them another try, likely when not as busy- that seemed to impact the overall expertise."}
{"text":"In my opinion, every restaurant starts out as a five star restaurant. It's their job to make sure they stay at five-star place in this place has a really good start. We normally go to this restaurants sister restaurant called Pub Frito over in Concord. So because the owners open this place up I knew it would probably have a really good start. Although the first time we went there it wasn't to eat because it was brand new it was just to drink service was a little slow but that's kind of expected when you have a brand new place. The second time we went there we had a party of 14 which is brave to take to any restaurant but I wanted to try them out to see if they can handle it. And they did with flying colors.

Although it was dinner I did opt for more of a lunch style menu item which was a fried chicken sandwich. This is either really easy to do well or really easy to screw up and they did it exceptionally well. The bun seem like an egg style bun but was a little fluffy or too big for my taste. So the bun was nothing like a Chick-fil-A style Bond but was more Artisan than anything. The chicken breast seem to be close to six oz which is kind of big surf or sandwich but I did not complain one bit LOL. It came with a side of fries which were freshly cut from what I can tell and there was an ample generous serving of fries but nothing crowding the plate. Our server also is very attentive and was Johnny on the spot with our drinks but I could have used little more water and the bused a little faster.   So far it seems like it's a solid place and I'm looking forward to going back there"}
{"text":"BRIM is truly a feast for the senses. From the floor-to-ceiling windows to the concisely edited menu artfully executed, everything within the walls of this beautiful establishment is designed to please. Unlike a seemingly overwhelming number of other eateries, BRIM doesn't suffer from the wont to be everything to everyone. There's no bloated menu, no mishmash decor and no pseudosaccharinic servers wearing harlequin grins. BRIM is a polished gastropub with friendly, honest service, a concise, well-executed menu and - wait for it - beer brewed on premise.

The first thing that struck me about BRIM is the actual building itself. Floor-to-ceiling windows bathe the interior with an abundance of natural light. Simplicity of design is evident throughout with a black and white color scheme complimenting natural wood and soaring ceilings. It's a rather large, open space that manages to feel cozy despite it's size. THe centerpiece is the open kitchen, proudly displayed and flanked to one side by the bar and to the other by a more formal, sit-down area. There's even a staircase the leads to what I can only assume is another dining area on the second level. It's classy casual at its best.

The service we experienced during our visit was nothing short of delightful. After we were lead to our table in the bar area, our server promptly dropped off a couple of waters before leaving to allow us time to look over the menu and decide on drinks. Upon returning, she took our drink orders and then began to go over the menu with well-honed expertise. She was knowledgeable about the food and the drink and made several recommendations all of which were spot on. A review on our service alone would merit 5-stars.

Speaking of drinks, the beer is the star here. The on-premise brewery, on display behind the bar, is where the magic happens. They've got a nice selection of beer to choose from, not nearly as large as some, bigger than , with styles ranging from the light to the robust. I was smiling ear to ear with the sightings of a few Belgian-style offerings. If beer's not your thing they've also got a nice selection of cocktails and wines sure to get your buzz on just the same.

Now, the food. The menu reads like a who's who of tasty tidbits, sharable small plates and larger gnoshes. It's a manageable size and everything on it will sound like something you'll want to try. For me, that was the biggest challenge. I wanted to fill up our small two-top with everything.

We started with the chickpea fries (perfectly crisp, golden brown a touch of heat lingering on the tongue courtesy of the cajun rumoulade) and the soft pretzel (dark brown, crispy outers, doughy innards and a bit of honey whole grain mustard for dipping). Here's something you have to do if you order the soft pretzel. Ask for some of the cheese sauce they serve on their mac and cheese. Seriously. This cheese sauce should come with the hot pretzel standard. And it should be made with beer. All brewpubs should have a house-made beer cheese sauce. All of them. 

For our main dishes we went with the scallops and the brisket patty melt. The scallops were sweet, perfectly seared and ridiculously delicious. The bed of soft, cheesy polenta, shaved brussels sprouts and drizzle of maple sweet and sour sauce the perfect accompaniment. My wife's sandwich, paired with a side of coleslaw, was elevated diner fare. The brisket was smoky, fall-apart tender and the bread toasted just right.

We couldn't resist the dessert - a deconstructed \"smores\" with a bar of chocolate ganache atop a bed of graham crackers and topped with a burnt whipped marshmallow topping. As if that wasn't enough, the dollop of salted caramel ice cream put it over the top.

So why the missing star? One thing, really. Seasoning.

All of our dishes suffered from the same glaring flaw - lack of salt. I hate to call out BRIM here, as we've experienced it more and more lately, but for some reason chefs have decided to push off the seasoning aspect of their cooking onto the diner. Salt and pepper shakers are cropping up on tables at placed everywhere and I'm not sure why. C'mon, guys. Salt. That's all I'm sayin'. A few crystals can elevate even a pedestrian dish and BRIM is far from pedestrian.

So aside from the lack of salt in what would otherwise be dishes I'd be hard pressed to critique, BRIM didn't disappoint. From the classy, relaxed atmosphere to the delish upscale comfort foods and, of course, the fresh craft beer, BRIM delivers on all accounts."}
{"text":"Super excited to dine at the newest place in two a group of friends and I make a reservation for five of us one month in advance. The evening finally comes and we could not be more excited. The vibe as soon as you enter is busy! We check in at the host stand and are told there is no table currently for our reservation time but a table upstairs which does not have chairs. Looking around we see there is clearly no open tables and it would be tough to approach the bar we agree. The host promises to get us chairs shortly. 

We are shown to our table which was actually a high top upstairs near the bar area. This high top is also located next to a larger group which clearly celebrating someone's birthday had been the ones guilty of removing the chairs from our table. Trying to keep the spirits high we stand at our table excited to enjoy the night. We wait for nearly 25 minuets for our server to realize we have menus and are not just jerks who took over a table. She was friendly and took our drink order. We inquire about the chances of getting chairs to sit before ordering dinner and the server seems to know nothing about the fact that we were promised chairs and recommend we just order. We do, meanwhile the birthday party is just starting to eat entrees ensuring we will not be getting chairs from that table anytime soon. 

Drinks come and dinner comes no chairs. The host comes back to our tables not to apologize about the lack of chairs or that we made a reservation for nothing but to compliment one of the party members hair color...
Our food was ok nothing special. Our server was doing her best due to the high volume. Overall disappointing for the expectations we had set for Brim. All in all don't go here expecting service. Go get drinks and snacks with maybe one other person if you need to but there are plenty of other places which would provide a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is so nice inside, and I heard they have a rooftop bar that I cast wait to see! Their branding and style is really chic and modern.

We both ordered salads, a caesar and chicken, and a burrata salad add chicken. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer which were absolutely delicious. The caesar salad was a romaine wedge salad which was surprising but annoying, it otherwise tasted good. I wish the burrata salad had some lettuce. I was disappointed in the tomatoes which were not ripe enough and quite tough and a little bitter/sour. It overall tasted good though, that cheese is amazing, as is the pesto!

Our waitress was very nice and attentive. I look forward to giving it another try."}
{"text":"First and most important, the beer was good. Hoping for more styles once they get going. But it was good, no off flavors. 

Service was pretty good considering it was their 3rd day open.  Issues but nothing major. 

The big issue I had was with the food. Can only speak for the one sandwich. It was an $11 grilled BLT. Thick bread dry griddled. Maybe 4 slices of thin bacon ( menu says \"slab bacon\" ) a few arugula leaves, and a smear of tomato jam.  Thankfully we added an egg (+$1 extra). or else it would have been a dry inedible mess. 

I'm sure they will work things out."}
{"text":"I have visited Brim quite a few times for both brunch and dinner. I've not been too impressed with the dinner options. Most of them have been mediocre in terms of taste - the fried chicken sandwich has been my favorite so far. Brunch options are limited, however, I've enjoyed everything I've tried thus far. Service is very hit or miss... Hostesses always seem confused or annoyed. And I have to agree with other reviews about the noise - it is always SO loud, it seems like the whole place echoes. The atmosphere of the entire building is what makes up for it - the decor is beautiful, the large open windows, the roof top patio."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Sunday dinner and there was plenty of seating. The beer menu is diverse with more than just IPAs like many small breweries (which is a huge plus as a non-IPA drinker). We tasted about four beers/ciders for free, which was nice. They also have flight sizes for $2 each. The Fuzzy Peach was a perfect summer beer and don't let the name fool you, it tastes like a true Belgian and was not overly peachy in the least. I opted to order the Brisket Patty Melt. BRIM lost one star because the food was very bland. The patty melt promised tasty brisket, grilled onions and mushroom, and horseradish aioli, but it was very plain. The meat was very tender, but had hardly any flavor and I ended up asking for more of the aioli, which actually wasn't very horseradish-y. My mom ordered the burger and also said it was quite bland. I'm hoping as a new restaurant, they'll work out the kinks in the kitchen because it is a great space with good beer."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Yes I ordered a salad as did my guest.  So what?  I got the beet and blue, which was adequately portioned with red and golden beets, moody blue cheese, and spiced nuts. Greens were fresh and portion was huge.  My companion got the Caesar salad and was happy with the anchovy bread.  She added on salmon, which was cooked well and huge.  Only gripe was that my guest felt she needed a sharper knife to cut through the bread, so maybe ask for a steak knife if you order the Caesar. 
Saw other plates coming out to other dinners, portions huge.  
Food came out at the right pace. Waitstaff friendly."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on a Thursday and sat on the balcony. The ambiance and beer were both very good but that is the best thing I can say. The service was decent but nothing to write home about. I would have been fine with it if the food was good but it wasn't. The hot pretzel was ok, but more breadlike than pretzel tasting. My husband had the Brim burger and I had the Brimpossible. He loves mac n cheese so spent a little more for that as his side. Some of the macaroni was still hard and it was pretty basic and minimum as far as cheese flavor goes. Our burgers had a weird texture to them. We agreed it kind of tastes like when you make frozen patties and don't get a good sear. Toppings were pretty basic too. I had chickpea fries and those were interesting but not worth the disappointing burger."}
{"text":"Went on the recommendation of a friend. Glad I did! Very cool place if you are looking for a lively, modern place. The service was great. Food amazing. Decent beer selection. Very clean restrooms. No doubt it was loud and the wait somewhat long (about 30 mins on a Friday night) but I loved every minute of it. There is a bar upstairs and downstairs. An outdoor patio on the roof and fair prices. Can't wait to go back in summer."}
{"text":"I recently went here for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere. The food was great and came out quickly; I would recommend the Mac and cheese as a side or meal! The portions were decent for the price, too. Our waitress was very friendly, but mostly inattentive despite not being very busy on the second floor. I'd love to go back to try some of the items on the beer list and other menu selections."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The most marvelous feature of this quaint restaurant on the banks of the chagrin river is its delightful parking lot. The ease of access to the building from your car is not to be understated. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 3:53 PM on a Sunday. It wasn't busy at all. We waited 15 minutes for someone to come to our table and ask for our order. That never happened. We ended up leaving. There were two employees at the bar. One standing around just staring into space and the other counting money in the register. I would've loved to of eaten here and it's a shame that the service isn't attentive in the least."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  We have been here twice.  The first time for just drinks and last Friday we came for dinner with friends.  The restaurant is clean, new and just beautiful.  It is a bit loud in the upstairs dining room, I believe due to the open concept and high ceilings.  We LOVED the eggplant app, OMG honesty awesome!!!  Dinner I had the short rib gnocci and my husband had the duck, both excellent.  The in house made beer is great.  I honestly don't have anything but great things to say about this place.  It's a great addition to DTW.  We will be coming back a lot in the near future."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit. We both got the brim
burgers with egg and it was delicious. Nice beer selection when it's stocked. So why am I giving one star? This past visit we weren't impressed by the menu changes and the service is on a quick decline. You get seduced by the great aesthetic but really theres no substance behind it. If we return it'll be for a to go order of fries."}
{"text":"It saddens me to lower my rating on Brim. Upon my most recent visit I've noticed changes for the worse on the quality of some of the ingredients and menu offerings. The restaurant atmosphere is still excellent. The service was good and I really didn't have any complaints there. One disappointment was the valet service charging $5 to park your car when there isn't nearly enough onsite parking to begin with. Also, I was shocked last night to see they'd changed to frozen French fries. This caliber of a place should NOT be serving frozen food. I tried the burger and it was decent, not excellent and not bad. It definitely was not worth $12 though. It had double patties, but they were dry due to being so thin. The sautéed onions mayo and pickled cucumber slices saved it. The brooch bun was fresh and toasted, but slightly charred which I wasn't happy with. I won't order this again. My glass of eye chart wine was $11. My friends enjoyed the quinoa vege dish, the chicken sandwich, the veges, and the French onion soup. The vege side was an upcharge though and was only sautéed summer squash, same as was in the quinoa dish. Both of those seem over priced. Many of the menu items still seem unique, which is good to keep people coming back to try more. If they don't jack up the quality on some of the items though, they'll start loosing customers here I think."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at brim for the first time.  The food was really really good!  Justin, our waiter was very good, very attentive and had great recommendations!  We started with Ahi Tuna nachos...awesome!  I had the chicken schnitzel with Pierogis and Cleveland kraut and Ron had the brisket patty melt.  Both were outstanding!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fun trendy restaurant. The short rib gnocchi was delicious and just the right size serving. My friends ordered orecchiette and that was even tastier than my dish. Ordered the blonde ale and it wasn't bad.  Light beer. Friend ordered pumpkin spice ale and liked it but felt it was a heavy beer to have with meal. More of a sipping beer. 
Valet parking is available but we found parking easily."}
{"text":"We visited Brim last night for our first time and we really enjoyed it.  Anthony was our server and he was very personable and knowledgeable.  Our friends met us there so while we waited, my husband ordered French onion soup and he loved it.  We both ordered a different beer, again, very good.  Our friends arrived, ordered samples of the beer and enjoyed all of them.  Our food was good as well.  My husband and I ordered the sirloin steaks that were the specials, our friends got Salmon and avocado toast.  Everything came out hot and very delicious.  The place really filled up after we arrived (we got there at 6:00) which is great to see.  Some reviews on here made us skeptical to try Brim, however, I'm glad we decided to give it a try.  We are looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious!  It's modern inside and the service is great.  I recommend getting the avocado toast.  It is amazing.  The drink options are also interesting.  Try the PB & J drink.  They also offer brunch on Sundays!  Who doesn't love brunch???  Great place to meet friends and family."}
{"text":"First time here and everything was amazing! Brim has a great atmosphere with wonderful waitstaff. The desert was remarkable and I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Second visit - no better than the first - still disappointed (if not more)

On my second trip, I ordered the Caesar (romaine / garlic croutons / parmesan / roasted tomatoes / peppercorn vinaigrette / veg / $9) and French Onion Soup (gruyère / sherry / thyme / croutons / $5). The waitress asked if I wanted the \"small or large\" Cesar salad, which was a little confusing as only one size was listed on the menu. I ordered the \"large\". She asked if I wanted the soup first, or if I wanted both plates at the same time, which I appreciated. Both arrived at the table simultaneously, which I requested. 

This pains me to write this, but this was easily the worst restaurant salad I have ordered in my life (bold statement). Do not write \"GARLIC CROUTONS\" on your menu if there are NO CROUTONS on the salad! Croutons are one of the stars of a Caesar salad! When my dish was presented, my first thought was, \"huh, they forgot the croutons\". Then, I found what equated to a large, stale, chewy Stouffers French bread pizza (sans toppings), whole under my lettuce. There was no way my butter knife was cutting through the consistency of this large piece of bread. I'm not sure a steak knife would have been much easier (although I didn't ask for one). I actually lifted it up and tried to take a bite, and it was like trying to chew threw jerky or shoe leather. What. The. Heck. The romaine that was covering this bread was completely wilted. Not crisp in any capacity. AND it still had dirty, brown ends! For anyone who has bought romaine at home, I'm talking those pieces you cut off the bottom and throw out immediately... Yep, was served them, wilted, in a restaurant. The tomatoes were fresh, and the dressing was delicious. The salad size was that of a typical side salad - if this was ordered as a full dinner salad (without the soup as a side), I would have been very, very disappointed. Regardless if protein was added.  Suggestions for improvement: crisper lettuce, and pay more attention to the pieces that are served. Ditch the gigantic piece of \"bread\" for actual croutons. Determine if this is either a side or a main dish salad - and then price it and list it on the menu as such. 

The soup was the best thing I've eaten at Brim to date, but honestly, it was nothing to write home about. I'd order it again, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about it. 

My friend ordered the seasonal vegetable quinoa with shrimp. Oddly enough the shrimp was shelled and cut into little pieces in the quinoa. My friend said it was, \"okay\". I couldn't get much more out of her. 

Once again, will likely try Brim again since it's so close to my house and the space itself is so cool. It's just a fun place to hang out. Please please please improve the menu! I'm begging!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will be back!! Great beer selection and the menu offered variety for a very affordable price! The view on the top deck patio was amazing and the service the same!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! i go for the food....but the drink selection is great too. their avocado toast is the best....and i have taken many people there who also agree. so happy they are close in willoughby and i hope they stay for a long time."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews here: first and foremost, the service was excellent. Prompt, quick and attentive - especially for a party of 10. 

This place is LOUD. We were on the first floor and even though it was a packed house, there's nothing to soften the sound throughout the restaurant. Hardwood floors, brick and glass walls, rafters on ceiling ... made it hard to hear across the table. 

Food was ok. They were out of four items on the menu (two being the ahi tuna nachos and fish/chips) - which was disappointing on a Saturday night. Food came out luke warm. I had the philly mushroom and didn't care for it. Waitress was nice to point out before I ordered that it did not contain meat. Poutine was delicious. Soft pretzel was also lukewarm and very oversized (but good). Burgers seem to be the hit of the table, but those with sandwiches said it wasn't very hot upon receipt.

Thought beer was wonderful. I'd go back after the newness wears down to give a second chance."}
{"text":"Good food. I like the standard upscale bar food with a twist. I enjoy the open atmosphere and enjoy my meal every time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, my kale caesar salad was delish, and the beer was equally fantastic. Gave it four stars because it was a little loud-had to almost yell to have  conversation."}
{"text":"\"Fill it to the rim with Brim\" A really impressive decor that goes with a real nice menu. A real interesting place to see. There's even an outdoor area with torches and a fire place on the second story. Looks like a good selection of craft beers. Very accommodating staff as we came with family and birthday cake. Bangers and mash was very good and all others said there entrees were very good. A nice place for dinner and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant!  Great atmosphere and service.  The menu has a great selection old time favorites mixed with unusual choices."}
{"text":"all the hipe beers are bland food is terrible .. this place is over priced and lame beer try the place across the street yes they have micro brews you will like better and they don't serve food across the street but they do have food trucks once in a while."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was terrible. We won't be back. I got the pasta Bolognese, and it tasted as if a shaker of salt had been dumped in. We were with 6+ friends, 3 of us got it and we couldn't finish it. The burger was ok, nothing special. For the price, there are many, better tasting, options around town!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best burgers I have ever had, I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the service was great! Will be back very soon, thank you."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because of the cool building and that it was a newer restaurant. I haven't heard the best things about this place from my friends that I've gone but I still wanted to give it a try. First things first they have an appetizer if that is a soft pretzel and it is hands-down the best thing ever. However that is pretty much the only good thing I have to say about it. The waiter that we had was not helpful at all. When we asked to hear about their specialty drinks and what they serve he just handed us a menu and walked away. Also when I told him I couldn't have dairy and I asked if a positive had cheese in it he said no and then he brought it to me and I was a cream-based dish and when I said I asked if you had cheese or dairy in it and you said no he goes I thought you just meant cheese. It is an amazing location with amazing potential. However I really hope they figure out the food to make it all that it's worth."}
{"text":"Overall, a very adequate dining experience. We went on Father's Day, so I made reservations online, through the restaurant's web site. When we arrived, the \"hostess\" told us that their system had been closed to reservations, but we were still able to to get a table.  Very cool atmosphere, and we were seated on the upper level with a nice view. Unfortunately, the woman who did is a favor by seating is in a half-full restaurant seemed put off by our presence. Luckily our waiter, Bob, was very friendly and made up for the initial experience.  Five people in our party ordered a variety of entrees. The tomato salad was very good, as was the mac and cheese and fish and chips. Very underwhelmed by the BRIM burger. Two McDonalds-sized  patties, sauce, cheese, onions and pickles and a few food service fries."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing place.  Menu is limited but super high quality and filling.  Top notch ingredients and just an awesome place to dine.  Couldn't drink but beer menu looked awesome too.  I would not take kids here but I would rent out the upstairs for events and use the patio in the warmer months for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great date night experience here. We ordered the pierogi app; he ordered the pork chop and a wedge salad, and I ordered the gnocchi. The server was sweet and recommended the gnocchi! Most of the time, if a restaurant is more upscale, you get such small portions, you leave hungry... This is NOT the case at Brim. Their portion sizes are generous! Because we made reservations online (easy! I recommend it!), we didn't have to wait, and our food came out quickly and was delicious. The best part, however, was dessert. I ordered smores, and my husband got the peanut butter cheesecake. Amazing. We will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"We went for a friends going away party. Love the location, food was good (had the burger and 1/2 beet and blue salad). We tried a few beers that were good as well. 

The owner stopped to chat, service was wonderful but parking can be a pain. Either way, we will be back"}
{"text":"two giant thumbs down. 

my parents and my fiancé came here around when the restaurant opened for business. it was obvious that they were ironing out some kinks. as appetizers, my parents and fiancé ordered braised beef pierogies, soft pretzel and i ordered the rice vermicelli noodles. i can't speak on behalf of the first two appetizers, as i am allergic to milk and eggs hence the reason for ordering the rice noodles. my family seemed to enjoy them and the rice noodles were absolutely excellent. for entrees, my mom had the cuban sandwich, my dad had another sandwich which i can't remember, my fiancé had the philly cheesesteak and i had the bulgogi. when my entree came out, i had not the slightest idea what it was, seeing as it was certainly not korean bulgogi. it was pieces of flank steak on top of brown rice. i informed my waiter that this is not what i was expecting, nor is it authentic bulgogi and it shouldn't be represented that way on the menu. he didn't even know what bulgogi was... he asked me to google a photo and show him. unbelievable. i end up ordering the chorizo tacos which were extraordinarily salty but edible (mind you everyone had already finished their entrees by the time my tacos came out 25 minutes later). 

my girlfriend and i came here for lunch once and then another girlfriend and i came for lunch another time. both times i was shocked to see almost none of the menu items from my previous visit were currently on the menu anymore. i ordered the quinoa with chicken both times and it was good. like i said, i have food allergies and there is almost nothing i can eat on the menu, especially since they took the tacos and noodles off. okay. 

last night, my girlfriend and i had dinner after not seeing each other in years. i suggested brim because of the patio and she wanted to eat outside. upon our arrival, our waitress seemed to be normal enough. for drinks we both had the fuzzy peach beer which were a little above average. i asked the waitress if i could order the orecchiette without pesto cheese and bread crumbs due to my allergies and just have it with the chicken, kale, mushrooms and garlic and oil, to which she assured me they could do. my girlfriend ordered the quinoa with chicken since she wanted a salad but Brim has literally 2 salads, a wedge and a caesar. our entrees come out and mine is clearly covered in cream sauce. my girlfriend tries it and tells me it's absolutely covered in cream and butter. i flag the waitress down and inform her, which is when she began getting an attitude with me and speaking like a valley girl. she takes the dish and comes back literally 3 minutes later and hands me the same dish... i tell her that this is the exact same pasta she just handed me and anyone with half a brain can see it's covered in cream. she tells me it's not and that she told the chef no \"milk, butter or egg\". she wasn't even bright enough to know that milk already covered the topic of butter, but what can i expect. instead of sending it back to the rude and dull waitress, we switched meals. so that's 3 times i've had the exact same thing here. 

here is the best part. i went outside with my friend while she smoked, and my fiancé was pulling in to have a drink with us (which we decided against since we just wanted to leave). when we go back up to our table, everything is gone. we're floored. we weren't even finished with our drinks and we told the waitress we would be right back. as soon as the waitress sees our stunned faces, a man comes up to me and says \"unfortunately your table was accidentally cleared off so we're remaking your food\". i told them that we already finished our food and i don't want more and we just want to leave. he says well you can take it home with you. i've already eaten this dumb quinoa 3 times, which i can make at home and am sick of, but fine. we leave and fast forward to getting home, i offered my food to my fiancé who hadn't had dinner and we open the container and it's the orecchiette, wtf????? the portion was so small i thought they boxed up my friends leftovers and pretended to pass it off as a new entree, except she ate all the chicken off of hers so it wasn't that. not only was it a portion for a toddler, but there wasn't even oil on it. this was so baffling to me that i couldn't wrap my had around it. why couldn't they just give me the entree i wanted in the first place, why did they clear our table off, among a million other Why's. 

i will never be back here and if you're a willoughby local, you've probably been told by a friend or two to do the same. this place could've been great, but aside from the bad food, the crowd is full of willoughby graduates who peaked in highschool. also the acoustics are horrific, especially since you'll be forced to listen to screaming 30 year women in gabriel brothers sun dresses and michael kors bags who for some reason are on their high horse."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to do this, because this is not a reflection of the service or food, it has to be said... a two star review. This was the view from the first few seats of the bar, in case you're wondering it is the ice bin...where they got the ice for my drink, which includes the resting place for their Ethernet cables. Unsanitary, lack of management, I don't know what to put this on but just overall not the view I want when paying $20 or more a plate. Told the bar staff, they didn't seem to care. On top of that, the drain above us was leaking, which happens to be where the upstairs bathroom is so I don't even want to know what was dripping on my shoulder. :(

For a new building and being the hot new place in DTW, this type of stuff cannot go on. It's a shame because the food is good, service is usually great but this will make us not come back."}
{"text":"A really cool and modern place. Everything we ordered on the menu was absolutely delicious - romaine salad (half a wedge), chicken sandwich, and Mac and cheese with chicken! Great for date nights, girls night, or just for drinks!"}
{"text":"Hmm so this is a tough one to score. Went on a Friday night to grab dinner and drinks, and sat at the bar. The design is pretty clean black and white modern with a splash of wood. The atmosphere is pretty casual and the place was full but not crowded.

5 stars for service. Both bartenders were really quick and attentive.

4 stars for the food. My friend and I both got the brim burger. The burger was delicious and the fries were fairly thick cut and well seasoned! The only minor downside is that they were a tad dry or something, I can't place it... Easily solved with ketchup though so not a problem. As a sidenote, the 2 people next to me shared the Friday backyard BBQ special, which was brisket and ribs and looked like a gianormous serving.

3 stars for their beer execution unfortunately but easily 4 stars for creativity. Full disclaimer, I'm not huge into sweet beers but I always like to explore, so there are plenty people who probably love these beers. I got a flight of: Primus pale ale, Mr Kringle Apple/plum ale, thai'd to the tracks lemongrass ale, and can't bring me down Belgium ale. The pale was pretty standard. The apple/plum was a tad tart but I enjoyed it - slightly heavy beer but very drinkable. The lemongrass was what you'd expect though could have used something else with it to boost or compliment the flavor. The Belgium was way too sweet, like maybe the sugar wasn't given enough time to be eaten up during fermentation? It was a pretty heavy and slightly thick beer, that I didn't end up finishing.

One last thing that is trivial. I tend to like breweries that rearrange my flight order to how best they'd want me to drink it... ie usually lighter to heavier to hoppier beers but not always. This wasn't done here but not all breweries do it. In my opinion and I guess as a suggestion, it's always a nice touch to do. It that extra attention to detail which is always nice."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time going but first time eating there. Our first two trips sitting at the bar were great. This time we sat upstairs in the patio. Good drinks. Our food arrived but we had to flag down a server because no one brought out any silverware which was surprising since it was not very busy. My cheeseburger was good. My wife's quinoa with shrimp was bland and she had to look for the shrimp. Overall, still a nice addition to Willoughby. Maybe next time, the food and service will be better."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try BRIM and was beyond pleased when we finally made it!! My sister chose to host her daughters first communion brunch here and we all had a wonderful time! We were on the second floor in a private area with a bar in near proximity. It was a great setup!  There was a pre-selected menu and it has wonderful options! I had the chicken and waffles and also tasted the pancakes. The chicken and waffles was absolutely delicious! There are jalapeños in the waffle, which are subtle but give it a little more heat and flavor. I absolutely loved it!! The pancakes were yummy as well, standard buttermilk with a wonderful syrup. 

The staff that worked our brunch was very efficient and attentive!  We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend BRIM! Check out the rooftop/outdoor bar when you're there!!"}
{"text":"This is really like a 3.5 star review.  It's nice they take lunch reservations.  Parking in the back is limited, I had to park across the street.  Cool modern interior & service was good.  My sandwich was super whimpy though.  Mushroom Philly sandwich should be hot & oozing with cheese.  Seriously how much does an extra piece of cheese cost?  The bun enormous and there was not enough insides.  Kinda disappointed.  Especially after the stop sign sized pretzel.  But I will for sure give them a second chance."}
{"text":"So disappointed! We've dined at Brim approximately six times and enjoyed our meals. We went last night and boy has the food and service gone downhill! The bar tender barely acknowledged us, was very scattered and appeared to not have a clue what he was doing. Had to ask for drink menus, food menus, never asked if we'd like another drink and failed to even say goodbye. The food... not good. I ordered the special. It was snapper with some sort of cheese sauce on it. Gross. My husband ordered French onion soup which he stated was \"sweet\" and a salad with \"grilled shrimp\". The shrimp was not grilled but appeared to be small frozen shrimp from a bag. When asked for a manager we were informed that the owner fired the management staff. Big mistake! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and drink. Love the decor. A bit noisy due to the ceilings but overall great experience."}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner as usual at Brim.  Food is very good, as is the craft beers.  Service is attentive.  There is really nothing negative to say except the noise level.  The place is too loud.  The high ceilings don't damper the noise.  Somehow they need to baffle the noise level."}
{"text":"I finally tried the fried chicken everyone has been raving about.  So good!  Had a side Cesar salad with it.  Very yummy.  It is obvious that all ingredients are fresh.  The flavor combinations go so well together with any dish I've had here.  Staff is so pleasant.  I love coming to The Brim!"}
{"text":"The brunch menu was great! BRIM takes reservations and walk-ins but I'm glad I made reservations in advance because the place filled up quickly. I had the bodega sandwich which tasted amazing. The sandwich was decently sized, but sides cost extra. I added the home fries and holiday sausage to my meal and was not disappointed! I loved the atmosphere and I would definitely go back and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok.  I wanna give it five stars cause for willoughby it's epic and beautiful and different. But I feel like it deserves three but I don't wanna drop there rating!  I went in on a Saturday afternoon.  Was walked up by host and sat on patio.  Ordered two cocktails off the cocktail menu and started with a wedge salad and asked to have it split.  It not only was not brought out split but we had no silver ware or plates to eat with.  The first thing u do after entering order to kitchen is present plates and silverware. But the added touch woulda been actually having it split.  The walleye sandwich was fresh and great but the service very rough!  I especially hate chasing someone down to give them my money!!!! That's the worst!!!!"}
{"text":"Brim is a new modern brewery in Downtown Willoughby. They have good beer and food. The prices aren't to bad... This is my wife and I new favorite place to place to hang out to have a some good drink and a good time. We had the beef brisket Patty melt and beef brisket perogies which was delicious"}
{"text":"Great variety in the menu, love the beer, beautifully designed. I haven't had any issues with slow service, and the place is usually packed."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and loved it each time.  Food is great, as well as service, atmosphere, drinks.  I recently had the Avocado Toast and hope they never take this off their menu; loved it!  Can't wait to go back as the menu offers a lot of options but they also have Specials that are always changing."}
{"text":"Last minute dinner for birthday celebration and once again, Brim did not disappoint! Same day reservations are always hard to get, but Brim came thru!

Two craft brews were ordered and both were excellent. Personally, as a Tribe season ticket holder, I highly recommend their \"Lost Tribe\" brew (like the pun!) 

All dishes ordered were served HOT, which was 5worthy peer my wife! All sandwiches were excellent and cannot go wrong with any of the \"hand holds\" aka, sandwiches.

Final note, if you like your burgers medium rare, do not worry if the they say they cook their medium well. They still came out juicy and to my liking.

Brim will be a regular dining place for us for sure!! Should be yours as well!"}
{"text":"Seriously thrilled to have a big city type restaurant in this small town. Great menu and well priced wine with good beer."}
{"text":"Yaaaasss!!!! So much good and not really any bad. 

SERVICE: outstanding. Everyone was friendly, they were quick with refills, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on both food and beer. Food came out at a decent rate as well.

FOOD: So, so good. I really enjoyed my dish and my friend liked his as well, although not as much. His complaint was there was too much sauce on the buffalo chicken sandwich. Otherwise, everything was great.

BEER: I have to hand it to their brewmaster, he/she does a bang-up job. Not only is the selection a nice range for different palettes, but the flavors and balance are outstanding.

AMBIANCE: Very cool space, they took the time and did it right. It can get loud, but that's to be expected in a warehouse building.

PARKING: Not awful, but not the best. We refuse to valet, and there was no room in the lot, but luckily the federal building across the street allows you to park for free.

In short, try it out even if you're not from the East side. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Was really surprised by this place. Great atmosphere, drinks, and service. Had the Elderflower Pear Collins; recommend it if you're a fan of pear flavor and drinks that aren't super sweet. 

I also recommend the brisket pierogis, wow! The flavors work together so well, I'll be dreaming about them tonight."}
{"text":"Impressive all around, but I expected nothing less when you pull some of Cleveland's best entrepreneurs, chef, GM and brewer together.  The building is stunning, the atmosphere has a great vibe both during the day and evening, the food was on point for Chef Nick Frate, and the entire staff - from Mike the GM to the bartenders to the wait staff, bussers, hostesses and everyone in between - were hospitable and fairly efficient for being 'just open.'  I was there for lunch with two friends on opening day and had the french onion soup and Fork and Knife Brisket.  The french onion soup is some of the best I've had, and I enjoyed the brisket very much.  The brisket has diced pickled veg on it and it can be a bit spicy.  So if you are not into a little heat, ask for it on the side.  Brett was our server and he was excellent - great personality and good service.  I was there again with a group of 18 for opening weekend Saturday night and had the chip and dip. EXCELLENT and creative presentation.  Friends had everything from the Avocado Toast, Quinoa salad, Beet and Blue salad, Caesar with skirt steak, Ahi tuna nachos, the pretzel, mac and cheese and everyone loved everything.  Eve was our server and she was outstanding; she is very friendly and was patient with our large table that took awhile to actually sit and order.  Unfortunately, I am not a beer drinker but those that had the BRIM brews enjoyed them.  Thumbs up Larry!  I had the Cidergeist and loved it.  Headed back there again this week a few times for various dinners w/ friends and can't wait to help BRIM show off what a GEM it is.  Congrats to all involved!"}
{"text":"Valet parking. Fru-Fru setting. I'm stopping for lunch while working outdoors. I don't think I fit in, as in I'm grossly underdressed..................I was surprised!! Yes, it cost more than fast food, but it was SOOOOOOO good!! The desert I had was a phenomenally scrumptious twist on PB&J! If Fru Fru is what you want, this place is definitely uppity! Very nice visuals! The menu has a high end look! The staff was very nice and very inviting. This is a definite redo for me!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday to meet my friends for dinner. I was early because I'm always early. I.walked in and was greeted by the host and she was on a phone call so I was patient to wait until she was done. She hangs up and I remind her of my reservation and that I'm early. She shows me over to a corner table. Which is perfect. Nice and out of the way with a good view of the place. I wait I unwind a little from my day and my server Jason comes downstairs and walks straight up to me and asks if I've been waiting long. I assure him I just got seated and he starts showing me the menus. He tight off the bat brings me four beer tastings and an appetizer shortly after. The service was perfect, the attentiveness and attention to detail was outstanding. And I can't wait to go back to try the rest of their menu. Very well done. I'll be back with more people next time:)"}
