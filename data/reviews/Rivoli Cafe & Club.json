{"text":"its a good location with awesome food , the taste of food is great  and its connected with a dancing hall at the backside with a wide variety of programs everyday...the service was exceptionally good.."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and the food is great! Nachos, wings, tacos - totally good. Service: especially on it and good looking."}
{"text":"The Rivoli is one of those venues/restaurants that always aims to please. It is one of my favourite venues for live concerts, and the food is always well made, fresh and delicious.

Came here with a friend a few weeks ago and had the walnut pesto. I don't think this is on their daily menu, may have been a weekend special, but you should aim to bring it to your actual menu as it was DELICIOUS. I have never been more satisfied with a pasta dish!

I also love that you can have a good night out here without spending your life savings. Thanks for being consistent, Rivoli!"}
{"text":"My husband and I planned a night of pool for a few of our friends and although neither of us had been to Rivoli before, Yelpers certainly helped me find the perfect pool hall for us! We didn't eat at Rivoli so I can't comment on the food but the bartender in the pool hall is awesome and super friendly. Both as a bartender and as the person that so efficiently took my reservation a few nights prior. We felt slightly overdressed which is great for us as we know next time whether we want to come in a pair of jean shorts and a tank or jeans and sneakers to be more comfy, it would be totally acceptable! Ages looked to range from about 19-40, and every one was having a good time. Very good vibe! Music was restaurant volume playing a mix, mostly top 40. $10/hour for pool on a Saturday night is incredible! Will definitely be back for an easy and relaxing night of pool again!"}
{"text":"The only reason why it's a 1 star is because they changed their menu.
I used to love this place, OMG.  Their Rivoli burger with side fires and salad was to die for.  I never ate burgers outside except from here.
Few colleagues and I went there on Nov. 11, 2014 and I have to say, we were so disappointed.  They've changed their menu.  Two of us ordered our usual burger and the other two ordered Pad Thai, well I have to say, the burger was awful.  I took two bites and couldn't eat it any more.  They changed the receipt???????? Why would they do that, it was the best burger ever.  The side fries were good at least.  My coworkers didn't enjoy her burger either. 
On a positive note, the waiter didn't charge me for the burger. YAY!!!
WHY TRY TO FIX SOMETHING THAT WASN'T BROKEN???????????"}
{"text":"The Riv. Oh the love hate that comes with the joint.

It's been around forever, they have a great patio, the service is mediocre, it's all about the Pad Thai, and they do a great job of resting on their laurels.

The Rivoli is the joint you go to when you work in the music industry, wanna see and be seen on Queen St. or if you wanna relive \"the good old days\" when it was relevant. 

The service is really hit or miss and they are known for the Pad Thai, but I'm all about the edemame and beers in the summer on the patio.

It's a nice middle of the road joint.
You can't go wrong, but it won't blow you away either."}
{"text":"YUM! quite possibly the best veggie burger I have ever, ever had. (and I've been comparing for the better part of a decade).. it may fall second to one I had in Vancouver, but because I can't remember the name of place and consequently can't Yelp it, the Riv wins.
Service was mediocre but I'll compromise for another delicious lunch. Great location too, good to go and people watch. Lack of debit sucks, but what are you gonna do.
I'm defintely going to check this place out again at night."}
{"text":"The pad Thai.. Where do I start on their \"famous\" dish.. Just.. Awful. Got it with tofu, and I'm pretty sure the tofu was bad. The veggies were gross, and the sauce just tasted like it had too much ketchup thrown into it. 

Got a side of fries, over cooked, hard, and chewy. 
Went on a weekend and it was dead. Got ID'd for dinner, which I'm guessing it the thing now, and every single time we went back in after going out for air while we waited for our food, the security guard just couldn't seem to remember us. Good work. 


The staff were so bored they were just singing, standing around, and dancing. 
Went to check out the new photo booth but didn't bother at this point.

Good luck to the new owners!"}
{"text":"The bartender suggested the Pad Thai and it was quite good, spicy but not burn your mouth hot. It has a small patio right on the sidewalk that made my lunch here a pleasant one.

The only reason for the missing stars is the men's room was horrid with a terrible stench and the walls looked like they have never been washed with dried body fluid everywhere."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing food and a casual relaxed atmosphere.  I highly recommend the pad Thai.  It's unreal.  Can't wait for patio season already!  Best patio for drinks and ppl watching :)"}
{"text":"The comedy show they had was really great for the price $5. It lasted for around an hour and a half."}
{"text":"For the amount of food you get, I don't think there isn't a single item on the menu that doesn't border on \"rip-off\" territory.

I ordered a Quesadilla and some sweet-potato fries and ended up inadvertently having a \"light\" dinner as a result. The quesadilla was TINY and one of the quarters was empty! As in.. no cheese, no chicken... nothing... Just two pieces of pita sandwiched together. How the HELL did something like that make it out of the kitchen!? I couldn't believe it. 

My friend and I waited a little longer then usual to be served and to receive the bill. Minus points for that.

The beer was over-priced by a couple of bucks. Minus!

My first experience here was sour enough that I will never return for seconds and has earned my very first 1-star review!

Arrivederci Rivoli!"}
{"text":"The service is so fast and the food is amazing I will definitely come back here again I recommend this for everyone even for family's you really should try it."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and I was quite disappointed. 

The food wasn't anything special, and the tables were all sticky. They have $5 Caesars for Saturday brunch, but the Caesar was so unbelievably fishy even the most Canadian among us couldn't finish it. 

The service also wasn't up to par. We had to continually seek out the waitress and ask for things. 

The atmosphere was good, so not everything was bad. But not enough good stuff for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"came here for friday night dinner

ordered
-pad thai 4/5 (very generous with the chicken)
-gnocchi 2.5/5 (it had a weird taste to it)
-martini and wine

The food was somewhere between tolerable and \"if there's no place else to eat tonight\".

Service was a bit neglected

Tables were crowded and tight.

Menu had very little options. Seriously.... 3 or 4 options for apps, entree and desserts.

Overall i'd probably never come back here, in fact i'd probably just go to mcd or hero burger instead of eating here. The food is not that great (except for the pad thai), the service was below average and the overall atmosphere was not good at all."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of history and buzz surrounding this restaurant/everything-else establishment. However, being uncool and not from Toronto, I didn't know any of this when I sat down to eat here. I think it's awesome that one place can offer great comedy shows, film festivals (Asian Film Fest was going on when I was there), darts, pool, karaoke, intimate live shows and great food. Plus, I heard this is where Kids in the Hall got their start. 

However, without knowing this stuff prior to most of my experience here, I was still a fan of this restaurant. My vegetarian mushroom burger stopped my conversation in its tracks upon my first bite as I had to pause to give it a look of semi-romantic adoration and share a couple glowing remarks with my friend. However, the service wasn't attentive and our waiter meandered about with an air of being too cool for everyone there. 

Regardless, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto and looking for great food, entertainment and a bit of cultural history. The patio is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"First impressions was that it was very dark inside. The waiter was very attentive and friendly.  Was good food with large amounts. Loved the nachos with pulled pork! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"For the first time ever, I was unable to get a pool table at c'est what (it seems like they are renovating and have gotten rid of the two tables at the back - what gives??) so I decided Rivoli would be a good second choice.

I've been to Rivoli many times, to enjoy the patio as well as to see live music. I always knew there were pool tables upstairs but I didn't realize there were so many! There are probably 8 to 10 tables and they are all arranged in one area. This leads to a much more social game which was kind of nice. To be honest, the tables were in pretty poor condition and the cues weren't all that great but it wasn't like it was unplayable. 

The thing I enjoyed most was the music. They had a great mix - from mid 90's rap (warren g anyone?) to lykke li to mgmt. Some of the songs were 'mashed up' as well. Even better was the music was at exactly the right volume which made it very enjoyable. I could hear the super loud music/vibrations from below and would much rather be upstairs (you don't have to play pool, there's a bar and seats as well.)"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on Saturday, and the food was amazing!  Each dish had a flavor that made it excellent.  The Banana Bread French Toast really stood out as awesome.  We were not disappointed with anything.  Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Caesar in the city!! (in my opinion)

Really wish they wouldn't have changed their Sweet Potato Fries, I was really disappointed at how thick, hard and undercooked they were last trip :("}
{"text":"En plein hiver, c'est sympa Rivoli, mais quand il faut répéter 'Rémy Martin' trois fois à la serveuse à cause de ma prononciation française pour se faire proposer avec glaçons, ça laisse pantois. La prochaine fois, je commanderai un 'Raymee Martiiins' - Mon amie avait profité de l'occasion pour commander un petit dessert, une tartelette aux fruits qui aura pu servir comme sous-verre. 

Bah allez, c'est un bar et salle de concert sympa à deux pas du Golden Horshoe. On y passe entre deux boîtes, on y passe pour retrouver du monde et s'entendre parler."}
{"text":"I would give this no stars if I could. Put our name in for the billiards table and the waitress told us we were first in line for a table. After a 45 minute wait a table became available and she instantly gave the table to the group second in line even though she knew we were still waiting and they had written all the groups names down. They definitely play favorites here. So, unless you're one of their 'favorites', scratch this place from you're list. Toronto has much better to offer than stuck up waitresses and long waits."}
{"text":"Had the Calamari, fries and a burger. One of the worst meals I've ever had in Toronto. 

The calamari was bland, fries were room temperature when we got them and the burger was too small for the egg bun. Like ridiculously small, full bites were bread only. Plus..I was asked if I wanted lemon mayo instead of regular and was charged for it..

Best part of my meal was the beer.

Never again Rivoli

 P.S. the lemon mayo is the same dip for the calamari!"}
{"text":"Tried the pool bar the other night, sometime in the middle of the week. It was quite understaffed and the bar was very inefficient, although granted it was a very busy night. Had to wait a long time for drinks and to pay. Will try it soon again to see it in different circumstances."}
{"text":"In the front, it looks like an average upscale bar (with delicious chicken roti!).  Upstairs, you'll be surprised to find a vintage-inspired pool hall housed in an old gallery.  Think that's pretty cool?  Venture into the back room next, and be blown away by the live bands, comedy, DJs and other events that happen almost nightly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place. The ambience meets all settings - first dates, date nights, professional and personal outings. The food is incredible. My main dishes are the Malay Chicken or the Kothu Roti. Here's a secret hint - order the peanut sauce side dish with the roti. Perfect compliment. The cocktails are impressive - dark and stormy in the Winter and Jose Blue Jay in the spring/summer - naturally. There's no surprise why this place has been around for so long."}
{"text":"This review is for their fish tacos only. 
The place itself is an institution, a perennial mix of performance space, restaurant/street cafe and pool (upstairs).

Had lunch here and chose the fish tacos. Seems that trend from south of the border has finally made it to Canada, although 'how' to do them was left down south.

For $13+ i got three damp (you know when a tostido is damp or hard shell for a taco is damp, it's game over...) tacos stuff with lettuce, some carrot strips, and deep down some tepid, damp battered fish. Hello? Anyone home? What the heck for $13, what a rip off, although for $5 they're not worth it. I've had fish tacos in LA and Austin and never without fail have they been great. Real tomatillo sauce, sour cream, lime juice, fresh fish, not overwhelmed with cheap iceberg lettuce, a melody of flavours that i look forward to each trip to LA. At the Rivoli the thing fell apart in my hand. That taco shell was damp from all the wet lettuce, it was more like eating a salad with a paper bag after the salad was sitting in it for 10 minutes. They were so bad I'm at a loss to adequate describe them!

I've heard the pad thai is a reliable source there....

Please take the review for the dish only and not the whole place."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of money and time. Ordered a steak and fries and it took them 40 minutes to prepare it and I asked for medium and got medium well borderline welldone. Their drinks are overpriced. Shitty place. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Rivoli is a Toronto institution; where can you play pool, have dinner and listen to live music all under one roof!  I made reservations for my SO's birthday night-out at the pool hall on the 2nd floor there were no issues with the reservation process.  I highly recommend making a recommendation on a Saturday night especially if you have a large group.

Pool is $10/hr and they charge by the minute.  Drinks are reasonably priced. But watch out, the music becomes super loud in the pool hall after 10:30pm.  It is like this pseudo club vibe.  Our group ventured downstairs in the restaurant for a more quieter ambiance. 

I tried out the nachos - they were ok, I wished they served more chips with the amount of dip they served.

So what is the verdict - will I be back? Likely, maybe in the early evenings for pool and I would like to try out other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Food and selection and value is just OK, it's a good just sorta meeting place but kind of sterile and late-1980's Queen West 'meh.' You will find acceptable Thai food to support your conversation. Queen Mother owns this place and is better I think.

Seems like an average, adequate  and indifferentToronto money-making machine, which leaves me cold."}
{"text":"This place smells of broken dreams and bad one liners. Seriously, it smells funny inside."}
{"text":"In all the years that I've been going to the Rivoli, I've never actually eaten here. It's the place we go when we want to play pool, and have a couple of pints. One of these days I'll order something and update my review. 

When we went the last time, there were 2 names ahead of us waiting for a pool table. Just ask at the bar if there's a table available, and he'll hook you up. $10 an hour for a table in the evenings. The wait ended up being about 30 minutes (this was on a Friday night), so we grabbed a drink, sat at a table and watched the last minutes of the hockey game (two small screens set up above the bar). When there's a pool table available, they call you over the PA system so it's loud enough for you to hear over the bar noise. 

We aren't pool sharks by any stretch, so the pool tables are good enough for our casual games over pints. Music was good - they have a DJ every night (http://www.rivoli.ca/poolhall.htm lists who is on). The atmosphere is very casual - great place to just chill, hang out, and drink with friends while playing pool."}
{"text":"All right, this'll be a bit of an obvious post if you know me in real life. I've been going to see stand up on Mondays at the Rivoli in Toronto since I was 19 years old. That's a long time, so that's gotta mean SOMEthing. It's a great room and I deeply suggest you go some time if you're in the city. You can see the weekly lineup here (http://www.altdotcomedylounge.com/index.php?id=acl). I'm keeping this short 'cause you really just have to go to see how much fun it can be. I could go on to list amazing people who perform there often, but that would be excessive and the list would be too long and you'd be all, \"Ugh, this list is too long. I'm not gonna click on any of these since there's so many. I'm too busy. SO BUSY.\""}
{"text":"I don't understand why are people are complaining so much about the food here. I was there for just for laughs. Yes it is pub food but it is pretty good pub food. We had the nachos and calamari and yes, I know it is he safest choice possible. Some restaurants do screw up the most common pub food, and Rivoli did not. My friends and I finished both these apps down to the tiny crumbs. So I guess when in doubt, just order the nachos and calamari!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking by while doing some shopping and saw the server come out with a burger and fries. It looked so good, decided to remember to come back from a few blocks past. 

We were not disappointed. They have a few extra beers than on the Beer menu, so make sure to ask. We both ordered something that wasn't on the menu. 

I, of course, got the burger with bacon and cheese and salad on the side. I'm not usually a salad person, but this was really good. Lemon vinaigrette, beets, kale and mixed greens. Probably the best salad I've ever had. I enjoyed it as much as the burger. 

The burger was moist and juicy and had this awesome tomato butter.

Overally, really recommend this place. Definitely could see myself coming back here next time we are in Toronto from Ottawa"}
{"text":"Only been here twice so my review is probably lacking what one would call a sober opinion.

The first time was to watch a live act downstairs. Dark and dingy its exactly what you would expect from a queen street music bar. They did charge I think it was $5 at that time but worth it as the crowd that comes are coming for that particular act.

The second time was to play pool, it was a Friday night so very busy upstairs with all tables booked up but there was only about 20 minutes waiting before we got our table.

Only complaint at that time was the glass collector picked up my drink but oh well was just an excuse for another one."}
{"text":"Just got back from a Sunday lunch at the Rivoli and I'm very satisfied.

There were four of us, and we all had something different and all left happy. The burger and sweet potato fries are amazing if you want something big, but I was in the mood for something lighter and went for the Southwest Quinoa Salad. Truly spectacular! And for a salad, that's high praise in my books! Everything about was fresh and delicious and all of the ingredients were well-balanced.

I had been to the Rivoli once before for dinner and enjoyed it, but am now a majot fan of the lunch menu. Highy recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've frequented the Rivoli for night time drinks on numerous occasions. It's always a reliable spot on Queen West and consistently has great evening entertainment  no matter what your pleasure, be it comedy, live music or something a little strange. 

This review speaks less to the night time entertainment and more to a great lunch I had this past summer while sitting with an old work colleague on the Rivolis cozy sidewalk patio. 

On a busy lunch hour in the city, you'll be hard pressed at times to find a spot on a patio, in the summer, with a cheap menu of high quality food and friendly service. The rivoli delivers on all fronts!

While my friend had a chicken and salad combo, I took our servers recommendation and ordered the tandoori chicken breast with salad and yogurt dipping dressing on the side. Authentic tandoori flavour, perfectly cooked and juicy - it was outstanding!

While the patio might be cold at this time of year, I'm sure the food is still piping hot and delicious year round. Totally worth a quick lunch or late libations!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This is the first bar I was ever served in. Lax attitude to checking IDs aside, it was super-hip then and has remained so over 20 years.


 The location is excellent. Queen Street West has always been effortlessly trendy, and the bar is a stone's throw from Toronto's Chinatown. In recent years they have introduced an outside patio area in the summer which was needed as the restaurant/bar areas inside aren't huge and weren't coping with demand.


 The food is quirky, tasty and the menu has an Asian slant.


 In addition to the food and drinks, there is a backroom with pool tables and it is well worth a visit on a Friday or Satureday night. I've seen some excellent bands and comedy acts here and it's really cheap to get in. It's worth checking their website to see what's coming up.


 When you've had enough of the Eaton Centre shopping in the individual and funky boutiques on Queen Street West, pop into The Rivoli to re-fuel."}
{"text":"Très bon bar pour jouer au billard en sirotant sa boisson. (une bonne dizaine de tables)
Il y a un rez de chaussée avec des tables classiques, l'étage du dessus repose plus dans l'ambiance gros canapés pour les groupes.
Pour la musique vous pouvez choisir vos morceaux sur une machine en mettant un quarter (25 cts)."}
{"text":"I came here for food on the patio and the food menu options were not attractive to me i ended up with the tacos on their snack section of the menu and they were too sloppy and the taste was not memorable the calamari was yummy however battered well"}
{"text":"The Rivoli located on Queen Street West is a very cool venue for live music.  Capacity for the live music section is limited to around 204-210 people. It is a decent space with exposed brick walls, exposed ductwork, with little white hanging lights strung from the ceiling.  The simplicity of the Rivoli works beautifully.  The acoustics are very good in the live music section and they appear to have a decent selection of beer.  There is a pool hall upstairs with vintage tables and a restaurant downstairs serving up comfort food.  The Rivoli is an unpretentious joint with a super chill atmosphere. 

I highly recommend the Rivoli Café & Club!"}
{"text":"Food was meh, but service and speed was terrific. Doesn't feel like home made food. Spring rolls seemed like they came out of a box and fries are too skinny for my liking."}
{"text":"Came here for a burlesque review on Sunday night. It was 'class acts' Toronto burlesque school. (http://www.torontoschoolofburlesque.com)! It was great. All the acts were fun and very talented... Beer was good as were the snacks like 'wookie balls' and loaded nachos.

{"text":"I love the music club in here and have been attending shows since I was underage. When I attended a show for NXNE on my way in I found the bouncer who asked for my ID to be aggresive and rude. Relax buddy... you work at the Rivoli, not the Guverment. I'd expect attitude from a larger club not an indie rock club. The bouncer working on Friday night needed a reality check. He made me show my ID each time I went inside. Considering the club had maybe 100 ppl inside he should maybe have remembered what I looked like as I went out to smoke. When I went out to smoke again I avoided the bouncer by going in and out of the back door.

Great Club, Aggressive bouncer."}
{"text":"As a fan of live music and patios, I can't believe that I have not been to the Rivoli in the 15 years I've lived in Toronto.

I'm not sure what's kept me away... perhaps the fact that the patio is almost always full and you get the feeling that those who are there are guarding the seats with their life. Or maybe I have been here, and I just don't remember.

At any rate, today, a good friend of mine called me up and asked if I wanted to join her and her wonderful little daughter for lunch. It was the first patio Saturday of the year and I knew that I could get to the Rivoli early and snag a spot of this perfect-for-people-watching -patio.

The menu is a mishmash of cultures, which I'm generally not a fan of, but for some reason, it seems to work here and I was surprised to see many things that I'd like to try. I got a table right in the corner and ordered a Caesar. 

GREAT Caesars here! Our amazing server asked me 'how do you like it?', which I thought was really nice, since I do happen to have a spice tolerance equal to that of a dragon. She returned promptly with a delicious looking drink, brimming with horseradish, sambal oelek, and crowned with three green olives and a spicy yellow pepper skewered on a cocktail sword. A GREAT Caesar!

My friend had the fish tacos, which she enjoyed and which her daughter deemed 'picy', which in year and a half year old language means 'spicy'. I had the Pad Thai. Normally a no no for me to order ethnic food when not at the corresponding ethnic establishment of said food. But I was quite surprised! The noodles were well cooked and tossed in a 'picy but slightly sweet sauce that did not appear to include ketchup. It could have used a little more fish sauce and lime for me, but I've had worse Pad Thai at actual Thai restaurants. The shrimp were fresh and plump and there were nice charred pieces of green onion topped with lots of crunchy peanuts and bean sprouts.

Our server was even so nice as to offer to bring some plain rice for my friend's daughter. We asked if we could have tortilla chips instead and she was happy to oblige. Luisa loved the chips and I'm sure the dog on the other side of the patio was happy to have a kid dropping lots of food for them to mow down on later.

I would definitely come back to the Rivoli. The people watching is fantastic, and although this strip of queen street has become more touristy than trendy, that's completely ok with me. There's an open feeling here compared to west of Spadina where there is zero room on the street and at the Rivoli, it's actually really funny to watch the tourist families gape at people who have pink hair.

A solid establishment."}
{"text":"Was a little surprised at the vibe this place had, as I was expecting something more classy. Came on a Saturday night and ended up going upstairs to the lounge. 

Seemed like a bar/restaurant downstairs, but upstairs seemed like a cross between a club and pool house. An odd environment when you consider that you may want to speak with others and hear what they say while playing billiards.

If you consider the two sections separately, it worked out fine. The music selection was quite good in my opinion, playing a wide variety of music and choices that were more 'old school'. 

Definitely a cool spot to hangout, but mot somewhere you'd want to pick if you plan on having a conversation of more than a few, yelled-into-the-ear words."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I'm from NYC and a judgemental foodie and everything we ordered here for lunch was phenomenal.

We ended up splitting the Southwest Quinoa Salad and the Warm Mango Salad (it was a special). Both were absolutely amazing with lots of flavors hitting your palate in just the right way. We almost licked our plates. The portions were also very large for the price. 

The only downside was that our Cokes were flat. That's about it.

This is definitely a good spot for lunch while shopping on Queen Street. The food is healthy, yummy, and not too heavy. It's just right and hits the spot."}
{"text":"Not bad, but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here unless I was coming to see a show or to play pool.  The food was fine (though cheap) and the atmosphere was decent, but the customer service (especially on the manager's part) left something to be desired."}
{"text":"The Rivoli, in its Queen Street hipster glory is one of the strip's institutions. A jack of all trades when in comes to a night out, except for perhaps the lack on an actual dance floor but aside from that, this locale has it all. 

The cool, chilled out vibe, a stage on the back on the first floor for comedy shows and bands. Plus a drink's lounge with a few tables and a full restaurant up front. 
However, the food is in my opinion so-so and as such, I never eat here. Not that I am against it or think the food to be horrible. I just think the food is average and as the foodie snob that I am I choose to spend my money at a more varied place. Yup, that didn't come out bad at all... :-(

This is a fusion menu and I try to avoid fusion at all costs but of course this is my predilection and very subjective. You might like the food. 

On the second floor they have a laid-back lounge with some 60's looking couches against a wall plus a few tables. Also one of the coolest looking pool halls this side of Yonge street. 

Also, in fairness I have had a few instances where I have found the servers/female bartenders, one in the particular to be quite rude once or twice. I do not know why, she was just very short and well, bitchy, (yes, I said it) once when they messed up an order one of my members had ordered and another time, when we were booking a pool table. Again, strange since we were 14 people about to blow through some cash on the pool plus drinks. But I would like to think about those as isolated events. I have dealt with her after and she seemed more relaxed. Still... 

I would recommend it as a great place for a third date, maybe a game of pool or a few drinks at their lounge or better yet, during the summer for a night drink at their patio. You won't be disappointed. .  

Either way, the Rivoli does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain to me why this place is so famous?? 
I mean, I get that there's music, which I missed, so maybe that's it. There were tonnes of pool tables which is why we went but we had to wait in line for TEN groups before we could even use one. It was not even packed and getting a drink took like 20 minutes. I get it, it's a cool place with lots to offer, I suppose, I just didn't think it was worth the wait. The energy/atmosphere was mediocre, as well. I should really give it another go, and maybe it was just a bad Saturday night at the Rivoli, but there just didn't seem much to be impressed by."}
{"text":"I think most of the times I come here to play pool. but it's the place to play pool. conveniently located downtown. the price per hours is just $7 I think and there is always a table available since there are so many of them.

the food downstairs is great too. the mushroom burger and some of the desserts are delicious. 

there are also some live music here from time to time with dance floor.

there is also a tiny patio up front for the summer.

the service varies from visit to visit. we had some great waiters who would joke around and smile and some waiters who would barely look at us and wouldn't want to serve us. that really affects the whole experience of the visit."}
{"text":"Sat outside and had a glass of wine.  They have a few selections for wines by the glass and also a specialty (seasonal) menu of wines by the glass.  Nice ambiance for people watching.  Waitresses are friendly."}
{"text":"I go to this place quite often so I will keep it short.
It's ok food not great. The main thing that killed it was the servers. They have this \" I don't give a fuck\" attitude and talked really loudly about their personal stuff.

It's an okay date place, for the first date but it isn't amazing. The flowers on the tables were really cute. When it's daytime they never put lights on inside (it's super dim) nighttime they have candles.

The food I got was fries (6$) and a burger (13$). Eh."}
{"text":"One of the most affordable pool bars downtown. Beautiful restaurant for a date or with a group of friends. The place gets super busy so I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food I ordered, but 3 stars for the overall experience and ambiance. This is a well-rounded place with pool, dancing, shows, food. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Its too bad the kothu roti I ordered was not that impressive. First, it took a while for my meal to arrive, and when it did arrive, it was not hot enough (temperature-wise). The whole thing was mushy and the flavours were just ok. If you want a good kothu roti, head down the street to saffron spice kitchen. Otherwise, Rivoli is a fun place to hang out and do some dancing."}
{"text":"This can be a great place to get the night started in downtown Toronto as it's got quite a few things going for it in the plus column. 

For starters it's central so it's a key meetup place being located at Queen and Spadina close enough to queen west or the entertainment district. Once there you have a pick of spots to sit at from the front patio, indoor booths and tables and the bars at the back or upstairs. It's entertaining and lively in many ways from the concerts and comedy nights, pool league nights on Wednesdays or just a generally laid back joint to kick back and enjoy a casual dinner and drinks with friends. Finally the menu is killer, plenty of fresh, healthy and diverse items on the menu, a bit of asian, a bit of pub grub and salads all of which are enough to keep the pickiest eaters at bay."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I checked out the backroom concert venue at Rivoli for Delta Ray. It was our first time visiting and the security and ticket personnel were friendly and it went smoothly. The bar in the back is efficient and fast, the venue is small so you really get a good vibe from the place. Sound is decent! 

Look forward to going back for the next show."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the food at the Rivoli. It's not often that a bar and club can manage to serve up really delicious (and well-priced) food, but my meal there was absolutely scrumptious.

I had the tandoori chicken and it was fantastic. It was boneless chicken marinated with Indian spices and yoghurt, oven baked and served with mint, lime and yogurt dipping sauce, rice and salad. The chicken was tender and juicy and oh-so-flavourful. I had tried by sister's Teriyaki Soba Noodles and my other sister's Bah Me Gai (noodles and chicken) both of which were equally delicious. The portions were big and filling and the service was great. 

I've also been upstairs for a work function and it's quite nice, but a much classier mood then downstairs."}
{"text":"(This is a review of the occasional Alt Dot Comedy Lounge events)

Don't tell my colleagues -- with whom I'm sooooper serious -- but I'm a huge fan of alternative comedy.  Sadly, all my favourite artists, from Patton Oswalt to Paul F. Tompkins, are based in L.A., and without institutions like Largo and the Upright Citizens Brigade, it's hard for a legit scene to flourish here.  That said, there are some great local comics that aren't of the guy-in-a-blazer-standing-in-front-of-a-brick-wall-telling-jokes-about-married-life variety, and the other night I got to see some very good ones perform at the Riv's Alt Dot Comedy Lounge (hope I'm getting the name right).

Sean Cullen's deranged, rambling, and hilarious improvised stream-of-consciousness rant was some of the best live comedy I've ever experienced.  Fraser Young is a great new talent.  And MC Marc Forward *destroyed* a pair of hecklers, winning the audience over with his animated confidence.

I really hope the city develops an alt comedy scene worthy of this town's just-below-the-surface weirdness, and I pledge to do what I can to support it.  We all need more funny in our lives, if only to offset the weather."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I am there I have to order the Pad Thai, it rocks. There menu is great and the food is always top notch.

The stage in the backroom can make for great intimate live music. You usually find bands showcasing there."}
{"text":"i had lunch at the rivoli recently.  i don't know why but i didn't expect much.  the rivoli has been around for years and i've never heard anyone recommend it.  i gotta say that i was very impressed by this restaurant.

the decor is contemporary and the service was very friendly.  i had the wookie balls and the chicken and mango wrap.  both of these are excellent choices.  if you're in the queen west area and looking for a good place for lunch the rivoli is a good option."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place a full 5 stars.because I have yet to experience the.cafe aspect.  If it was based on the pool.hall upstairs, I'd be more than happy to do so.  Anyway, I like this place.  You venture upstairs to find a spacious pool hall with a bar.  The decor is nice, and makes it very inviting.  Unlike most places, the Rivoli offers comfy chairs to sit and wait your turn.  Tables in good condition, what more could you ask? I guess I would more or less describe this place as a pool lounge. Check it out."}
{"text":"I usually end up here during sunny afternoons, and have to say its one of my favourite patios in this stretch of Queen Street. Prime people watching territory, thats for sure. 

On the drink front they have Grolsch on tap which is always a win in my books. 
I've never been disappointed by their food. Its what I would define as perfectly pleasing for its price (I'm pretty sure everything on their menu is less than $20).
When I stopped in here again the other week I had the Jerk Chicken Wrap which was the special of the day and it was great. Really nice mango chutney in the mix which worked well for it. 
I'm also a big fan of their french fries, which are not just tasty on their own but also complimented beautifully with their chipotle mayo! I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.

Service is a bit hit and miss but its a pretty chill atmosphere so its best to just go with it and just make sure you order drink refills before you get empty."}
{"text":"Simple, honest, and wonderfully tasty food. Everything I've tried so far (soups, salads, sandwiches) has been amazing and cheap. If I'm in need for a reliable meal and I'm near by, Rivoli is definitely where I'm headed!

Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Came here for some pool with some good friends.
Friends had already ate earlier so we decided to eat while at the rivoli while playing pool.
I've had some pretty crappy bar food in my life but this place takes the cake when it comes to GROSS food.
I ordered a burger and fries and my husband ordered a roast beef sandwich and fries.
The fries were okay, bur were covered in cilantro? I've never seen that before, and i'm not a huge fan of cilantro. Covered in ketchup it was tolerable.
The burger had a very strange tomato/spice/cilantro paste on it which completely turned me off.
The roast beef was still pink and not thoroughly cooked, in all the roast beef sandwiches we've ever encountered I've never come across one that was still pink.
We also got nachos as an app, the first layer was good, nice and cheesy and tasted great albeit also covered in cilantro.
however once you peeled back the first layer the rest was a smooshey mushy nacho mess.

The only saving grace was the great service from our server and the excellent pool tables/rates, at only $10 an hour for a table? that's fantastic!

Overall we did have a great time with our friends but the menu definitely needs to be improved and expanded on. Barely any choices and what's with covering all the food in cilantro? yuck."}
{"text":"The legendary Rivoli is still there to please. Sat on the patio this afternoon and had some great Pad Thai and Pork Tacos.  

The service was spot on. 

The location pretty much can't be beat for people watching. 

I can't wait to go back there for a night on the town. It's been too long. :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for an early dinner on a Saturday. We didn't really expect much from food but we were just hungry and looking for some fresh, non-fast food options. 

The restaurant was not packed at all, yet it still took the servers a bit of time to get us seated. When we got seated, tables were slightly sticky. Not big deal though. 

Service wasn't amazing,but it was not bad. Very average. Same with the food. I ordered a veggie burger, and it was ok. I do like that I was open faced though, interesting. Alfalfa sprouts were fresh and the mayo was tasty.

However nothing special. Very very mediocre food and service"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere during the day & and at night. The food options are limited but nonetheless, the few options they have are great 

The Nachos are a great option! 
But if you want a full meal I suggest you eat before you get there & just go for snacks and drinks"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, I went fo a late lunch on a Thursday and it was empty. The service was great, the layout was cool, but the absolute best part was the food! I got the roti, they don't serve it the traditional way, which the waiter warned me off, but I loved it! Perfectly seasoned and was the right amount of spicy. The cocktails were delicious (and strong), as well."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed the Rivoli!

I've been coming here for years. What's great about Rivoli is it is one of the only venues I can think of that has such versatility! Large spacious pool hall in the top floor, live music and comedy in the back room, decent bar area on the main floor, small patio at the front and the food here is definitely good for pub food.

Great \"Jack of all Trades\" bar. You can't go wrong if you're wandering on Queen and need a place to go."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had while in Toronto. Went in looking for drinks and dinner and had a great time. Staff was friendly and entertaining. Drinks were good and food was amazing!
We ordered the Malay Chicken grilled boneless chicken with Southeast Asian peanut sauce, steamed jasmine rice and cabbage, carrot and radish 'slaw, Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken, shrimp, sprouts, scallions, egg, peanuts and chillies, in a sweet and sour sauce and the special which was a ribeye with potato salad. The peanut sauce on the chicken is addicting, it was so yummy! 
If you are looking for a fun bar in Queens West area of Toronto, this is the place! I will definitely return if I ever find myself in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the Rivoli in a few years. I went yesterday and had the same Siam Wookie Balls I did seemingly decades ago. Nostalgic yes, but still great!

They don't have any cider on tap, which would be nice.

The tacos were so-so. Bar-taco-like and nothing to remember.

Service was fine and laid-back."}
{"text":"Came here after yoga at Lululemon a few doors east. Didn't feel like getting something too greasy so I got the Pad Thai which was $13.  I had low expectations since I've had bad experiences getting asian food at non asian restaurants.  The Pad Thai was better than I expected.  The shrimp was cooked just how I like them but the chicken was a little dry. Noodles tasted good and the veggies tasted fresh.  Having dinner on a Queen street patio was a nice bonus as well."}
{"text":"THIS has become the new payday-afterwork-shinanigans place for me and my work crew.

There is a pool hall = at $6/hour you can't go wrong. The pinball machine allows you to bring a kid and keep him occupied for hours on end while you gobble with your chums.

$6 drinks - not  bad.

Good atmosphere , delicious food(although a bit pricy-ish)...Really, you need to go.
Downside? well, the pool hall is upstairs, so if you're plastered off your face, you may have some issues coming out for a smoke...which could also be a good thing -keeps you from being pissed drunk.
Also, there is only 2 stalls in the washroom - really - that's about it I think."}
{"text":"You can usually find two sides to any place you go into, like you may find a place that has a fantastic club sandwich and also has a brilliant darts league.  The Rivoli actually has three sides to it.  Sitting on Queen Street just east of Spadina, the Riv has been known for, among other things, their great dining area and food, their room at the back, and their pool hall upstairs.  Each one has a very distinct flavour and brings something very cool with it.

First, there's the main restaurant area with booths, a long main bar, and a great menu.  The tap list is tasty but you still get a full bar.  The menu is fairly wide offering many different options for dining.  There's also the patio option in the summer months that sits out on Queen West with full view of the pretty people and hoboes alike.

The back room hosts concerts throughout the week and weekends with Monday and Tuesdays being dedicated solely to comedy.  One of the longest running regular shows in Toronto, the AltDot Comedy Lounge hits the stage Mondays.  So successful has it been that they have added a second show that follows immediately after the first showcasing comedy newcomers (read \"really new\").  Tuesday is the SketchCom Lounge, housing Toronto's sketch and improv troupes.  Both nights are pay-what-you-can.

The pool hall is just that; a pool hall that you'd expect to find on Queen West.  It's stylish, cozy, and based on the fact that it's usually choked with guys that are assembling their own cues from their cases, there's no way that I would play there.  I'm a three-pinter at best."}
{"text":"House CabSauv is kinda woody, tannic taste but alright for a house red.. I have eaten here before, just not this time.. Pool upstairs is ok - lots of tables, and clientele is pretty normal for Queen West.. Never been for comedy in the back room but I should check it out sometime.."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai has been built up so much that I was kind of expecting more, but, although it's good, it's not the best I've ever had either. The Wookie Balls, fried sesame seed-covered rice balls, however, were an interesting surprise.

It's casual, not pricey, and what you'd expect from a Queen West local haunt. 

The breakfast isn't bad either - it's just too bad it's not served until 11:30am."}
{"text":"If you want to sum up Rivoli in one word, it's this: Versatile.

I've been to Rivoli for: 1) comedy 2) drinks 3) dance nights 4) pool (upstairs) 5) patio hangout 6) food 7) live music upstairs

At minimum, it met expectations every time.

That makes it ideal as a backup plan. If you're anywhere nearby and your plans fall through, you're pretty much guaranteed to find a spot at the Rivoli for some drinks/food.

One of the great dance nights here is Footprints, which happens monthly on Saturday Nights.

Although Rivoli doesn't amaze you in any one area, it gets bonus stars for incredible consistency. It's an extremely reliable option. In a city that's constantly changing, that can be hard to find."}
{"text":"With the lack of diversity in the menu, i held the bar pretty low. However, the Steak Frites was excellent! (As were the fries) I went here by myself while on business, had dinner with a few drinks at the bar upstairs, and then played a few games of pool. The game is very expensive ($12/hr) but I needed to play.

The bartenders were good. They were attentive and even kept some conversation. The lady gave me a birthday shot for free so that just about made my night!"}
{"text":"Decent food, although not totally thought through (an open-faced burger is a neat concept but not so great when it comes time to actually eat it). Good amount of vegetarian options that can be customized for vegans, and GF options too. Service is okay but could be better. Only reason for 3 stars is the comfortable atmosphere and average tasting food."}
{"text":"If you're looking a nice place to eat during your shopping adventure, then you found the spot. The food is quick, tasty and well priced. Also a good place to grab a couple of drinks with some friends in the summer time!"}
{"text":"Service was not so great. Staff seemed a little uninterested in serving. The caesars and calamari were yummy though!"}
{"text":"I must say i've been to this place several times and was never particularly impressed with it, until today. I went there for lunch and had the lunch special. It was a lamb burger with a roasted red pepper and feta cheese sauce. It was great. The lamb patty was extremely flavourful. Quite tasty. It came with a side of sweet potato fries. The fries could have stood to have been crispier but overall it beat my expectations.

I'll probably go back for lunch again sometime."}
{"text":"There is this band called Nirvanna that really wants to book a show at your establishment. They seem like nice gents you should give them a shot because they seem disparate and its kinda depressing."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here practically every time I'm visiting Toronto, and I have yet to be disappointed by the service (to be fair, we only go for the pool and the bar). So far, I've never had the trouble of having to wait for some pool table to open up, and would also consider the bar relatively inexpensive. All in all, a great spot to play some pool and have a drink with your friends!"}
{"text":"Neat spot downtown with a wide offering of meals. I tried their Shrimp Pad Thai (asked to have the Chicken substituted for more Shrimp) and it was delicious! Not too saucy and shrimp was cooked well - definitely worth another shot."}
{"text":"My wife & I had our 1st date at this place 21 years ago. So we decided to go back to celebrate that occasion. 

My how things have changed & for the worse. In my mind this place is a dump. It was dark & dingy with little tiny seats. I felt like I was sitting on the lap of the couple next to me. The service staff was decent & fast. For me it was just the environment. I can say that the food was decent. We had only the calamari & the Pad Thai...both pretty good. After that we left. Next time we'll celebrate looking from the outside in."}
{"text":"I've been contemplating this review for months. It's hard to review a place that you're so intimately connected to - for almost a decade it's been my \"local\", my go-to, my second home. I've lived and worked around it for so long I know most of the staff by name and they know me - it's truly the Cheers of my heart. And the staff has stayed the same for years as well, give or take some new faces now and then which I always consider a good sign for a restaurant/bar.

The Rivoli has everything. 

It's a trendy Queen west spot without the attitude. It has a coveted patio in the warmer months - TIP: they only have capacity for the number of chairs out there so don't bother asking them to bring out more. Wait patiently, seek out empty chairs and make yourself a spot!

It has a restaurant in the main section with lots of seats that is always busy. A good bar section if you want to sit and watch tv. It has a back room concert/comedy set up with good local bands and acts on many nights of the week - it's also a location for north by northeast if you're a music fan. Upstairs is a beautiful pool hall with a smattering of tables and booths to sit at, another good sized bar, some couches and about 10 tables in decent shape and some pinball action too. The menu is available upstairs as well.

The food is good. I love all the appetizers because they're veggie friendly. The sauces deserve special mention - the peanut sauce with the spring rolls is almost drinkable! As is the sweet and sour sauce for the edamame. The garlic mayo with the sweet potato fries and calamari is also a favourite among my friends. The salads are on the large size, the wings, burger - even the mushroom burger are all good. The pad thai, the roti, all good options - the modern fish sticks are my fav but they only have them in the summer. To be honest, eat mostly the same thing every time I go - spring rolls, potstickers and edamame and I'm never diasppointed! Sure, it comes with a higher than average price tag, you're paying for the location but it certainly isn't more or too much than anywhere else downtown. 

A full bar, good selection of beers on tap and the wine list is ok. Not great, but ok. They make a delicious caesar and martini, something for everyone. The Rivoli is the same owners as the Queen Mother and the food is better at Queen Mum but you can't beat the hang out options at The Riv. 

They do some theme nights upstairs in the pool hall - a local favourite is bump'n'hustle Saturday nights with a great dj and fun dancing, they do karaoke sometimes, I've been to charity events, wrap parties, Christmas parties, birthday parties, all sorts of fun upstairs. You'll find a decent smattering of tv/film people here on any given night as it's close to lots of production companies in town so be careful if you're here to gossip about work!

Whether you are shopping on Queen, looking for after work drinks, brunch, lunch, dinner, a place to drink a bit too much with all your friends, play pool, catch a concert or comedy show, have a first, second, or fortieth date, the Riv is the place. Oh, did I mention the juke box? They have that too.

I am not doing this place justice but perhaps that because I'm protective of it as my favourite place in the city. I just moved a little further away and honestly miss it sometimes. My work is still close so we still frequent but it's not quite the same. I've been to lots of cool places in my new hood but nothing that offers everything the Riv does. Long live the Riv!"}
{"text":"This review is for the backroom/pool hall.

I've been here twice so far both times on Sunday's, the place is always decently busy. It's $10 hr for pool. 

The place is nicely set up with the pool tables towards the back. And more of a lounge area and the bar near the front. The lounge area has booth seating and lots of room if you wanted to hang out with a group of people. 

There are a lot of pool tables and they're a good size, I've been to places with smaller tables. There's always lots of chairs and seating around the tables as well as a lot of cues to pick from. The worst thing is when you can't find the right cue. 

There's always good music playing the the bartender is always cleaning up any dirty glasses left behind. From what I've been the only staff there is he bartender and security but everyone seems friendly.

There's only one bartender from what I've seen but you don't have to wait to long for drinks which is great. 

Overall I recommend this place if you want to hang out and play pool."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot to go for a drink or a concert. They also have a ton of pool table upstairs. But this review is based off the lunch experience.

The menu has a lot of pub and bistro like options. Steak frites, burgers, pasta, etc. I opted to try the gnocchi and you can tell it was freshly made and not from a package which is good to see. It's just a bit bigger than most places I've had it. It also could have used a little more salt but it tasted clean and fresh.

When looking around at other dishes I thought the steak frites looked like mostly fries with a smallish piece of steak. The lunch experience was ok but when our company Christmas party was there it was awesome... so many good sandwiches and sliders. Why don't they have that kind of stuff on the menu?"}
{"text":"Awful service! The waitress only came over when we flagged her down, and she wasn't even busy. She was huffy about everything and we made no outrageous requests or demands except to get some drinks once ours were empty. At one point she walked away in the middle of someone ordering and when I tried to get her attention for a glass of water she obviously heard me (as she had the hostess bring the water) but she made no acknowledgement whatsoever. She was terrible. I certainly won't be back. The hostess was friendly, though."}
{"text":"The waitress started by saying she was off - she was off, off in timbuktu. The service was lacking. But the pad thai was great as usually. The sweet potatoe fries were so hot, the roof, the roof, the roof of my mouth was on fire. 

This is a great place to eat when you can't think of another place to eat."}
{"text":"I am confused how a Yelp elite says the food here is great. Everything I tried was barely edible frozen food. The burger seemed home made but they put some kind of sweet honey garlic to bind it. I wasn't expecting anything great from this place because I know it more as a concert venue pool hall. My review is based on the food alone."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE Rivioli. They had the best sweet potato fries, grilled cheese, and mushroom burger. 

Menu has changed and the food isn't the quality it used to be. 

Sad."}
{"text":"Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! One of my favourite Caesars in Toronto! Their food is pretty average I would recommend Pad Thai, didn't like much any other food I tried there but once again I just go there for a Caesar!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. For so many reasons. Both entertaining and tasty! Just had a return visit to our old home town of Toronto...we go back a couple times a year and never fail to hit the Riv for some old favourites. I have eaten many spring rolls in my life but theirs remain my all time fave - never greasy and the sauce is not like the others. And the pad thai (ordered spicy!) is the perfect cure for lagging jets. Our friends had a bunch of other tasty looking items, but I can't seem to stop eating my old faves. Love that they have great music and comedy and super people watching to boot. Classic Toronto hang out."}
{"text":"Didn't think the service could get ruder or worse..but it CAN and DID!

Met up with friends that were already there having a few drinks. We sit down on the patio with them to order our food/drinks and suddenly there is a guy yelling at my friends who were there first telling them that they can't bring drinks from the inside to the patio (they were on the patio the entire time!!). Weird.....
Next we have a female server that really doesn't seem like she wants to serve us. And when it comes time for some people in the group to leave, she tells them they can't leave or pay for their food/drinks unless we all do. She wouldn't split out items or let people pay separately. Ridiculous! 

ONLY GO FOR THE POOL UPSTAIRS."}
{"text":"Didn't go in the glory days but this is a Queen West institution. 

VIBE 
Great date place. Casual, unassuming, a bit dark. The size of the booths on one side of the wall are PERFECT pour deux. The music room in the back is great for small concerts and a very laid back vibe during the major festivals. And the pool hall area upstairs is great for larger gatherings. Very multipurpose. 

I EAT/DRINK
I always get the basic Heineken/Cran Vodka here. The calamari is underwhelming; you're better off with the chicken satay or the edamame. I also really like their pad thai. The food here is pretty good value for what you get. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Yes, Feist used to work here. But she doesn't anymore."}
{"text":"I've always loved this restaurant, great food. However, with my recent visit to Rivioli, their services definitely disappointed me. The waitress messed up on my order (charged me less than what was the 'supposed' to be price). It was extremely rude and unprofessional of the waitress to come back to me, while i was in the middle of eating and ask me to pay the 'remaining fee', when it was their fuck up."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to come after work or for lunch.  They have a patio that is right on Queen street, so u feel like u are part of the crowd.  I had their Rivoli burger and it was alright, a tad on the dry side, but the sweet potato fries that accompanied it were amazing.  our waiter was funny, we went there on a sunday and he informed us of how hungover he was.  It is a great casual place to eat with friends."}
{"text":"I love to come here for the dancing! They have this cute little upstairs spot that was free to enter for dancing. Amazing hip-hop, R n B and some great oldies tunes. What a little gem! When I want to get my dancing shoes on for a price that is very right, I know exactly where to go. The food is really good as well! Its set up so that its a super cute great date place with a good ambiance."}
{"text":"I went and ate at the Rivoli for the first time last night. Its very nice on the inside, until last night I'd only been up in the pool part, or in the back for a comedy show. 
I had the Mushroom Burger with sweet potato fries. I was pretty happy with my meal. It did take awhile to get to us, BUT I was expecting slow service after reading the reviews here. The mushroom burger was better than expected although a TAD dry...I'd give it a 7.5/10. The sweet potato fries were phenomenal, though...the only suggestion I have would be some kind of dip for them. 
Dips make everything better! The prices weren't too steep either, the mushroom burger + fries were $10.95, which is completely reasonable. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Was there on Fri May 8th. A small group of us were doing the Scotiabank Contact Photography festival and we were walking for a few hours. So we ended up here. One of the people in the group said that their pad thai was famous. I was starving and ordered it. I was very disappointed. It was too gloopy and too ketchupy. I was too hungry to send it back so I ate it all.

I will go back but for something else."}
{"text":"Whoa, Rivoli! Your fried calamari is SLAMMIN'!"}
{"text":"The pad tai was sub par. But they have a good selection of beer at a decent price. Lots of events and shows being held here. Pretty cool atmosphere.  Definitely a place to check out. Check their website for shows. Its usually a good time."}
{"text":"Nice little patio for watching all of the hustle and bustle of this stretch of Queen Street West. Upstairs pool hall can get packed up by the bar as well. Eclectic group of people, lots of after work people."}
{"text":"Good food. Me and my friend we both enjoyed our food. 
I had their ravioli (a daily special). 

Wished their patio tables were bigger but sitting inside by the window was nice. 
A nice place to go on a date. 
Will be going back to try other options on the menu (esp the burger)."}
{"text":"I saw a comedy show in the back room.

It is a decent size with bar-type seating running along one wall and tables scattered on the floor.

The show is called AltDot Comedy Lounge and the Alt apparently refers to alternative comedy. Maybe I don't understand what alternative comedy is but most of the show seemed like regular stand-up. 

There was no waiter service during the show so people often got up to get drinks from the back of the room.

They were giving away movie tickets and t-shirts which was cool. I don't know if they do this everytime.

They were about 3/4 full on a Monday.

Even though the show wasn't mind-blowing, it wasn't all that bad either. I might come back sometime."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend today.  The inside decor has been upgraded and looks great.  Miss the booths but the place is brighter and seems more spacious.   Staff are mostly a bunch of cute and attentive young men.  Had a minor complaint about our Pad Thai and were treated with little extras that were perfect and the owner apologised herself.   What a neat place...destination for Queen West!"}
{"text":"Let Nirvanna The Band play at the Rivoli! They have tried so hard to get on before!! Heck, they even had to sneak in there ffs"}
{"text":"I LOVE the bartender here. Really I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out. He had this line of bitters behind the bar and when I asked about them he brought them all over to me and told me they were his personal collection and he just liked playing around with flavors in drinks. He had me test them and asked if I wanted him to make me a special drink. SUPER COOL. I hope he reads this to know he made my solo trip way more enjoyable and there should be more approachable bartenders like him :) This venue has a lot of live music but its in a separate room so you dont know if the local artist is good unless you pay a cover. I skipped the live entertainment because I liked sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"OK - I've been here so many times, but never written a review.  Here's the deal:

A true Queen west spot ... 

- summertime it is one of the few/good patios in Toronto ... due to the location - one of the best for people watching
- upstairs is a great pool hall .... about 10 tables all in great shape with good cues.  They charge by the hour.
- food is pretty good
- music venue in the back ... this place and ajoining horseshoe / gm have decent acts rolling through regularly.

It is not a 'club' so much ... but a mix of pubby, live music and pool hall vibe."}
{"text":"I promise this will be the last review that
1. mentions the Kids in the Hall
2. mentions the fact that \"all I had was a drink, once, here\" (at least this time it's not organic).

So, the KITH did a *secret* TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY SHOW here a couple months ago. Due to my Film Festival job commitment, I *did not* go wait in line for tickets, which I knew I would get if I got there oh, just before dawn the day of the show. What I did not know was that I would also have gotten them if I went around a reasonable hour, like 8 or 9, according to the couple we met while drowning our sorrows at the bar. Or if I had sent a friend who loves me *that much* (I have a couple).

So, instead of thinking how cool it would have been to see them here back in the day, now when I walk by, I get a pain in my gut of anger, disbelief, and self-hate at missing them, practically on purpose. I doubt I'll be checking the Pad Thai out anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came in here to kill some time before dinner and ended up here a lot longer than anticipated. The music was great and the waiting time for a pool table wasn't too bad, about 10-15min. 

Make sure you put your name on the waiting list for a pool table AND make sure you keep checking if it's your turn, the bartender completely ignored their own waiting list and didn't check with people that were waiting around the bar. The bartender did make up for it with a round of drinks on her but still, know you.

Overall, good atmosphere, cool and relaxed, I'll come back to kill time or end an evening."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink with a friend this week. Staff was pleasant, although they were out of the ingredients to make the first item I tried to order off the cocktail menu. Also worth noting that this is peak hipster stomping grounds, which may or may not float your boat."}
{"text":"Just went for the pool tables and a beer.

Tables have ripped cloth but are playable."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place when I was going to U of T, but that was a long time ago and after more than 12 years I came back for lunch. 
I ordered the Pad Thai, which is still a popular dish on the menu. The portion was a bit on the small side, wasn't as spicy as I liked it to be, and the few pieces of shrimp I had was a tad undercooked and didn't taste that fresh. I much prefer the Pad Thai at the Queen Mother, a much more satisfying Pad Thai.
Service was very good though, fast and courteous."}
{"text":"I used to go to the RIv back in the 80's when I worked down the street. I was pretentious then and still is, not sure why. Its overpriced and the pseudo Goth/artsy crowd are obnoxious and somewhat ridiculous. Not a fan"}
{"text":"I usually head to the Rivoli for a relatively quick lunch or a loungey dinner. Their daily specials are always creative and tasty and include a soup, vegetarian option, meat option and pasta option (which can usually be vegetarianized as well). I'm particularly fond of their black bean soup and also their spicy tomato and chickpea soup.

Friendly service and wonderful food presentation. This place is owned by the same people who run Queen Mother down the street so the menu items are often similar!"}
{"text":"\"What are you going to give this place,\" asked my girlfriend as we settled up, \"a zero?\"
\"No,\" I replied, \"a zero would be a homeless man on the street who offers you a drink and a burger, but instead throws loose change at you.\"

No, Rivoli deserves 1 star, but know that it is only a step above a homeless man shouting at you as you pass by. From the chairs designed to give you a back ache and get you out the door as quickly as possible, to the clearly over-worked and inattentive staff, to the bland food and watered down drinks, Rivoli is most certainly the worst club in Toronto. So bad was Rivoli, that I created a Yelp account specifically for this review.

Our meal began promising enough, with a menu full of exciting cocktails filled with exotic ingredients. But as we would soon learn, both the food and drink at Rivoli could be summarized by the idiom \"don't spit on a cupcake and call it frosting\".

I ordered a Dark and Stormy, and was given what I can only assume was a cocktail consisting of 70% water, 20% ginger ale and 10% rum. \"One bad drink doesn't spoil the bunch\", you may say. I would be inclined to agree with you, yet the Amaretto and cranberry my girlfriend ordered turned out to be just as watered down as my drink. The same was to be said about the two gin and tonics we ordered afterwards.

In between our \"drink\" orders, we decided to grab an order of tortilla chips and guacamole. To Rivoli's credit the order arrived quickly, but to their discredit it quickly became apparently why it came TOO quick. The tortilla chips, clearly poured directly from a bag and onto the plate, were plain and boring. \"No one cares about the chips, its all about the guac!\" you may say. I would be inclined to agree with you, yet the guacamole tasted suspiciously like the pre-made guacamole I've purchased for myself from No Frills and was cheap, tasteless and altogether boring. It certainly seemed like a delicious and tempting order based on the menu description, but turned out to be over-promised and under-delivered.

With a stomach full of cheap, bland and over-hyped food and drink, we decided to forgo any more food, pay, and run for the hills. \"You can't say you gave the place a fair shake! You didn't even order an entree!\", you may say. I would be inclined to agree with you, but we could continue no longer.

Go for the live music acts certainly, but do yourself a favour and stop at a corner store and the LCBO before you do. You'll have the same food and drink, and you'll save yourself some money."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the atmosphere of the Rivoli and find it a great place for drinks but I can't get behind the food.  Most recently I had the fish tacos which were OK but not in any way remarkable.  I normally love fish tacos but could have taken or left these.  The Pad Thai and other dishes I have tried are similar - decent but nothing to make returning an experience to look forward to.

The mixture of bands, pool and comedy are great and make it good for nightlife, but the food takes it down a star for me."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here on Halloween weekend. The drinks upstairs were great and the DJ downstairs was amazing. Everyone was dancing which is exactly what we wanted"}
{"text":"Came here after a dinner party. Place was pretty bumping at around 12 on a Saturday. I didn't go into the downstairs part, only upstairs, so my review is solely based on that. 

Upstairs has about 12-15 pool tables, a dance floor and a bar. Literally one arcade game (that I could see anyways). Drinks were standard fare, music was alright. Some dude dj'ing off a laptop. 

Dance floor was a hybrid between washroom hallway, entrance, bar. No one was dancing lol. 

We tried to get on a pool table but we're 17th of the list. So we left after about 30 mins. 

Probably won't be returning. 5 mins away is Spin, must better atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Rivoli is a Queen W icon from a time way back when Spadina and Queen was the place to be on a Friday night. She's a real dame. A triple threat.

Upstairs they have pool tables, a bar and booths. Downstairs they have a lounge-style restaurant and the infamous people-watching patio. At the back of the main floor they have a live music venue and another bar. I've seen some good shows here, so keep an eye 

For dinner here I've had the Beef Stroganoff (excellent) and the mussels (decent). Their drinks are surprisingly reasonably priced. 

NOTE: If you are going to an event here you will be ID'd at the door. Even if you're *33.

PEPPER POINTS: For having bathrooms upstairs and on the main level. No rape dungeon bathrooms in this ol' girl. 

*Happened to a friend on their 33rd birthday. I am not yet 30, and I will be 28 for a while. Like 6 years-ish. Deal with it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great for dinning outdoors on the patio. However this place doesn't have the most appealing menu and service can be inconsistent."}
{"text":"went here to play billiards with a bunch of friends...very impressed by the amount of tables available as well as the price for the time we used. 
drinks were well priced as well
will defiantly go back"}
