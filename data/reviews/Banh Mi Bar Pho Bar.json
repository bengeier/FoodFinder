{"text":"Been there with a couple of friends and I must say this place the Pho is fantastic . Will for sure coming back there again."}
{"text":"BBQ duck and BBQ pork belly banhmi were delicious! Crispy bread, fresh veggies, sweet BBQ and juicy meat."}
{"text":"Newbie at Kensington market specialized in Vietnamese food.  Haven't tried their banh mi yet, and decide to try their pho on first try.  Ordered spring roll as appetizer and house special pho for lunch.  First impression is decor is comfy and modern.  They have their menu written on the board and varieties of plants hanging in from of main window.  Bottle of water was offered on the table which is good.  I guess by browsing the setting they naturally focus on non Vietnamese clientele.  First comes spring roll, surprisingly it actually tastes decently.  It's not so oily like other place and filling is quite delicious while preserving the crispness of wrap.  The dipping fish sauce is flavourful as well. On the other hand, mail dish pho special is not as good.  The broth is clean and fresh but not as flavourful as other places.  It tastes quite average, and the portion tends to be on the low end.  It's pricier than other Vietnamese spots nearby but I don't feel their pho distinguish itself from others.  Maybe I might come back and try their banh mi as snack, but probably not pho cuz there are other cheaper places nearby."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pho and the atmosphere was welcoming. What I didn't like we're the amount of flying insects. They were like fruit flies but bigger. The bathroom had them--so much so that I had to pick two of them out of my hair before returning to the table--and that was as soon as I got there. They were in the restaurant too and I had to keep swatting through dinner. If they could get the bugs under control I would have had a much better experience."}
{"text":"I order through just eat with them. I got really sick after eating their food. I had the vermicelli with pork & spring roll. I had 5 days of diarrhea and vomiting for 3 days. I was so sick, I couldn't even get out of bed and I couldn't go to work for a week. Everything I puked out was the vermicelli and it smelled like garbage. I went to the doctor and he confirmed with me that there's a virus in my stomach from something I ate. My doctor reported two restaurants to public health and this was one of them. The investigators went to both restaurants and they only got back to me on this one. I was told that they had MULTIPLE issues with handling food that can cause me sick. The one thing they emphasize on was how they handled cooked meet. They were lay on the counter overnight not in the fridge. I don't want to be mean but I have to say something just in case if someone else get sick."}
{"text":"$7 for BBQ pork belly Banh Mi. Desultory service for take out (how hard can it be?) and very little meat in a bun that wasn't even French bread, more like a hot dog bun. Better and cheaper Banh Mi on Spadina."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place with a friend today. We both had the pork belly special Banh mi. I wanted to love it, but felt it was subpar. The bread to topping ratio was horrible, I felt like there was way more bread than meat and the veggies were paltry. Flavour was lacking. My friend got his with kimchi and neither of us were impressed. Reviews here are so hit and miss - some love it, some hate it. I may go back, but not to try Banh mi.  I prefer Banh Mi Boys and Ginger, which are about $1-2 cheaper for the same thing done better, and closer to me."}
{"text":"One of the best Bahn Mi sandwiches Ive ever had. My favorite is the BBQ duck. What really sets it off is the two different types of homemade hoisin sauce they have. My brother had the pho, and said it was on point (a decent vegetarian pho broth is hard to pull off). The place is cozy and clean, a nice view of the park accross the street, and the lady that runs the place is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Pretty good!   Cash only.   My fiancé and I try a tofu banh mi and vegetarian pho wherever they will make it for us. We hoofed it out here with high expectations.  The banh mi came out first. I would def recommend adding the egg and the kimchi. It had a generous amount of pickled vegetables and cilantro so I was a happy person.  Then came a giant, steaming bowl of veggie pho (mushroom broth). The tofu floating in it were in large strips; they were unmarinated, very dry, and quite toothsome. I had trouble navigating them. I'm very used to getting bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños and cilantro on the side and felt this bowl lacked a heat and brightness I look forward to. While not a typical bowl of pho, it's still a very savory bowl that I dumped a lot of chili paste in.  Pleasantness and cleanliness were a 2 for me. I can eat at any hole-in-the-wall, but there was a deep conflict between the outdated furnishings, the service and the beautiful anatomy of a banh mi. I guess I went in expecting more of a hipster vibe instead of a run-of-the-mill banh mi joint, but I still enjoyed my food.   We also tried the Vietnamese coffee hot and it reminded me of instant hot chocolate and coffee mixed together. I'd maybe pass next time since it was 4.50.  Otherwise, I'd give it a whirl if you were in the area, but go in with the mindset that it's no frills with lots of choices."}
{"text":"Had the Banh Mi sandwich with lemongrass, pork and kimchi and it was fantastic. Friendly and attentive service as well. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great food! Lemongrass chicken and lemongrass porkbelly banh mi = Delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, would definitely come back here again! I had the rare beef pho and it was awesome! The broth is soo flavourful and the portion is HUGE!! Very reasonable prices as well for what I got"}
{"text":"Bang mi shell is legit! The filling is ok. Love the decor and the owner, super friendly"}
{"text":"First stop of our food crawl TO. Food was pretty mediocre tbh. Both the tofu and beef rolls were plain and uninspiring. We left quite a bit uneaten.    Patio was nice, but we allowed to be served alcohol outside, pretty much ruining the point of a nice patio.  Left quickly after."}
{"text":"Came in here to get a bahn mi because I saw them advertising $3.75 bahn mi. What I didn't see was that it was $3.75 for bahn mi sliders, so I was quite surprised when I was slapped with an $8 bill for a bahn mi. Whatever, that was my mistake :P  I got the duck bahn mi and it was delicious. So many flavours in one sandwich. Toppings weren't exactly generous for the $8 price tag, but they put so many sauces in there that it's a burst of flavour every bite. The bahn mi itself took forever to make. My husband was waiting outside on their patio while I waited inside for our sandwich and my husband actually text me to see if everything was ok because he was waiting for so long. I wasn't impressed at how long it took to make one sandwich, considering I was one of two people waiting for their food."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's as good as bang mi boys but without the soul crushing lines.  Also they have a lot more options plus alcohol. So far the lemongrass chicken and the BBQ pork are my favs."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favourite places to have Vietnamese food! They're speedy and they have an amazing broth. They also have a large variety of apps that I enjoy...my boyfriend always makes it a thing to have a banh mi when we go out for viet (which isn't always an option in many places so this is perfect). Why 4 stars instead of 5? I've had their deep fried tofu app multiple times and there have been a few times when there is no filling in half of the dish! But when it's all there, damn it's good."}
{"text":"There's a reason why their sign doesn't say \"Pho Bar\" on the store front. I guess people go for the banh mi and save their pho cravings for else where.   After a cool Sunday stroll around Kensington we felt like soup noodles and pho sounded like it would hit the spot. This place totally missed the target.   Their broth tasted of too much iron and just wasn't pleasant. We ordered the rare beef($9) and house special ($13). The rare beef was too lean like another yelper mentioned and as a result, was tough. The house special came with the tough rare beef, brisket that was like chewing threw leather, chicken that had no business being there (bland, mealy texture), and beef tendon balls which, I guess, were just from frozen. The noodle was actually the only thing that was well prepared. It was al dente like I like it but there wasn't much of it. Also the portion is between a small and medium from other places.  This was so disappointing and I hope they improve or get rid of it from their menu.   What saved this pho experience from getting 1 star instead of 2 was the service. The server and chef who was very nice and attentive.  CASH / DEBIT ONLY"}
{"text":"The banh mi I had here was amazing! I tried the duck and was pleasantly surprised that it was so good since it was my first time trying duck in a banh mi. The bread was crisp and airy and the duck was cooked perfectly with a hoisin/bbq sauce to compliment it. The flavors were such an amazing combo and I was in love! I don't live in Canada but when I am there I will be sure to come back. If you love/like duck, I recommend you try their duck banh mi."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Satay banh mi. Was good"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. My fav is the Chicken and Lemongrass Pho Ga. Unlike some of the reviewers on here, I think the Pho broth (regular beef) is delicious and more flavourful then any other Pho place in the neighbourhood. But then I don't like super fatty beef anyway, I think it's the right balance for me. I love the chicken wings- flavourful and tasty without being breaded and super deep fried! My other favourite is the pork and shrimp in tofu skin- it's AMAZING and kind of phyllo pastry like. I'm a celiac so it's a fun treat for me. On that note I've never been \"glutened\" here and Linda is great at making sure my dish is soya sauce and gluten-free. We can't wait to try out their new location on Dundas!"}
{"text":"Glad this place is close by.  Quick friendly service, and decent food.  I only wish they'd make it slightly less spicy for the wimpy white lady."}
{"text":"*Though they had an extensive menu with different toppings for pho and Banh Mi, what piqued my interest was their Northern style specialty dishes.   *our server for that night was terrible. She didn't bother to fill up our water and when asked, she even forgot. C asked for hot water but the server said they only serve hot tea, not hot water. How do you make HOT tea without HOT water then?!   -Vietnamese Crab & Tomatoes soup (Bun Rieu Cua) - $10.99 Traditionally this soup is made with whole blue crabs and it's not possible to find the fresh ones in Canada. This is also one of those rare Vietnamese dish that is extremely time consuming to make from scratch, so I was quite intrigued when I saw it on Banh Mi Bar's menu. Unfortunately when the hot noodle soup arrived at our table, I couldn't smell the pungent shrimp paste that is normally found in the broth. Both C and I can tell that they used canned crab meat and there was also a mixture of pork in the soup, which is completely fine. However such ingredient was not mentioned on the menu, so for people who don't eat meat this can be quite unexpected. Since there was no shrimp paste, the broth was bland and honestly it tasted like a tomato soup...   -Duck & Bamboo noodle soup (Bun Mang Vit) - $10.99 The duck & bamboo noodle soup at Banh Mi Bar reminded me of my mom's bun mang vit, and that says a lot! The broth was flavorful and fragrant with the juicy duck meat and bamboo shoots. If I remember correctly fresh bamboo is not required for this dish, and my mom usually use the dried ones as they are much easier to store. The bamboo was soft while still had some crunch when you bite into it. The duck meat was tender and not too fatty, but -1 for them to not serve a ginger fish sauce for dipping!"}
{"text":"I'm back with another Vietnamese restaurant review!!  I always end up here whenever I'm around this area, for good bánh mì and casual atmosphere.  The first impression when I came here is the the cozy, yet modern decorations. The menu is well written in black and white. You can either sit inside, or outside enjoying the summer breeze and a nice view of the park.   You may find most of their dishes taste different from some other Vietnamese restaurants, since they make their food the Northern style. However, as a Southerner with the Northern root, I found this place very authentic. I have tried there Bun Rieu Cua (Vietnamese Crab & Tomatoes Soup) and Cha Ca La Vong (Grilled White Fish with Dill and Vermicelli) and they are both amazing.   It's so hard to find a good Bun Rieu Cua anywhere here, but this place happens to make it the right way. I could smell the shrimp paste when they started making my dish in the kitchen. The broth is very flavourful and tasty. Just a head up, if you don't like the smell and taste of the shrimp paste, let them know so they won't put it in. It come with crab meat and tofu, and vegetables on the side.   Cha Ca La Vong is originally from the North of Vietnam and honestly, I haven't found a place here that offers this dish. It is fried white fish marinated in turmeric and served with vermicelli and plenty of herbs and dills. You may find it intriguing with the amount of dill in the dish, but it will make sense once you try it. The dill brings out the flavour of the whole dish, and it's served with fish sauce on the side.   Oh did I mention how much I love their BBQ Duck banh mi? It was...sensational ! I always order this when I want to have something quick and filling. The banh mi is filled with a layer of cucumber, shredded duck, a mound of carrots and daikon, coated with BBQ sauce and topped with cilantro. *drooling*   Besides those, their spring rolls and chicken wings are pretty good as well.   The price is reasonable and the size is decent (cash only). The washroom is clean. The owner is truly a sweetheart. You may bump into me here, who knows? ;)"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today for the first time. Banh Mi Bar just opened a couple weeks ago.  The place looks great and the food is fantastic. I'll definitely come back again. Happy to see another great restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for lunch and ordered the rare beef pho, and it was underwhelming to say the least. The noodles and broth were average and didn't differ much from other pho places I have been to, but the worst aspect was the rare beef. The meat didn't taste very fresh and they chose an extremely lean cut that didn't have much flavour. In addition, the portion size was tiny in comparison with other pho restaurants - after eating the bowl I felt like I barely ate a snack. After taxes and tip it added up to about $10 dollars so I expected a good amount of food.  The service was fairly lacklustre. I waited at the door for a good five minutes while the owner periodically stared at me and worked behind the counter. Although I think they generally have customers place the order at the counter, it would be nice to let new customers know their system of  ordering instead of ignoring them. After placing the order, the food arrived promptly and the service included the owners dumping the food in front of me and quickly walking away.  Overall I was quite unimpressed by the service and quality of food. From reading the other reviews, I probably should have ordered some of the other options."}
{"text":"We read reviews about this lovely little restaurant in Kensington  The food was fabulous. I had a bun sandwich and my husband had a noodle dish with spring rolls. Both were delicious  The owner is also the waitress. She is so friendly.   I highly recommend this restaurant situated on Augusta right across from the park"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, very tasty sauce, quick service, and a nice patio at Kensington Market. Was in the area to pick up some tea/coffee and needed a snac on a muggy Monday afternoon and this really hit the spot."}
