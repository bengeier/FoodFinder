{"text":"This seems to be the go to place for us. It's hard not to come back when the food is so good. 
We usually get whatever specials they have because they're always delicious. Their regular menu is also very good. Tacos are tasty and creative. Meat on the ribs always fall off the bone.
The atmosphere is fun and the service is always great. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal establishment! 

Reminds me of a little Mexican place I frequent in NYC. Keep in mind, this is not a traditional Mexican cantina and they mix a lot of Asian influence into their dishes.

The food was fantastic and the ceviche is not to be missed. Although mojito is not on their drink list, the bartender made one of the best mojitos this side of Havana. One big plus was the variety of fresh oysters for the night. The misses and I devoured the dozen kusshi, lucky lime and raspberry point oysters they brought us as an appetizer. 

Server was top-notch, not only in their speed and attention to detail, but also very helpful in assisting us to decide what to try next."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS OUT OF CONTROL AMAZING!   Visiting from NYC and couldn't stop ordering more tacos.  The vibe, service and margaritas were equal to the amazing food.   Those in this neighborhood are truly lucky to have this gem to eat at!"}
{"text":"Rate this place just short of five stars because I did find this place a bit pricey. But I did find there fish taco really delicious, fried ice cream amazing and there service was super attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is great to meet up with friends and have a relaxed lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Was here in March with some colleagues for an early dinner and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! 

The decor is very cool, Korean/Mexican/hipster which should be my nightmare but I dug it. 

We shared kalbi ribs and guacamole to start and I think they're both must-orders. The kalbi ribs were deliciously tender and had a nice Korean bbq marinade (sweet, salty, tangy). The guac didn't last long, chips were a bit overly salted but actually when paired with the guac it was balanced. 

For tacos I had 1 crispy taco with braised short rib, and 1 baja fish. I loved both of them, but would probably pick the short rib over the baja fish next time even though it was quite messy. The shell didn't crumble as much as your old el paso would and the short rib jus had some deep flavour. Two of my colleagues had a crispy chicken taco and I was admittedly jealous - it will be ordered next time, they raved about it and it seemed to be a popular pick on other tables at the restaurant.

I found the service to be lacking, our waitress was hard to get a hold of and we waited quite awhile for drink orders to be taken and delivered once we had arrived (it was a pretty mean margarita though - not lacking on the tequila). 

Worth a visit if you like playa cabana!"}
{"text":"Food here was pretty good.  I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had the shrimp tacos and kam poon gi (chicken) tacos last time I was there and they were both really good. I was worried they wouldn't get the Korean flavours right but it was pretty spot on from what I could tell. 

Service was good but I recommend getting a reservation if you're planning to go. The place is always packed at dinner and getting a table walking in off the street is tough. 

Only issue with the restaurant is that it's pretty cramped and loud. Which I understand appeals to the hipster crowd. Not really the type of place to go to though if you wanna have a great conversation while you eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is amazing. The bartender is super attentive.     The tacos were AMAZING!! The prices are decent for them too. The best one was the braised beef with the hard shell, so juicy! Only thing is that it's very crowded and when you eat you can accidently elbow the person beside you or vice versa."}
{"text":"Returned for a second time and had the same waitress \"D\" who is just amazing add the food. 
They added ceviche, which was great! The tacos are top notch and I would honestly just stick with them. The mains sound super interesting, but I really enjoy the different little tastes that tacos offer."}
{"text":"Just came back from Barrio Coreano with high hopes of a Korean fusion experience. The ambiance, food and drink seemed far from Korean. Starting with the drinks. We had a 9oz glass of wine and a Kimchi sour. The glass of wine was clearly not 9oz, and the server shrugged it off when we mentioned this. Kimchi Jack Daniels sour was not bad however really needed kimchi. Tasted like a regular jack sour without eggwhites. 

For a newly opened reataurant I was expecting lively service however ours came across as quite cold and someone who didn't want to be there. 

All of our food came very quickly. The Baja fish taco was quite good. Really liked the onions and radish that they used.
I was excited for the octopus taco however it came cold and the shell was soggy. Wasnt freshly made for our table.
Korean beef taco didnt have any Korean flavourings to it. 
Calamari was cooked perfectly and really enjoyed the spices however the kimchi and korean pear served with it was missing a mark. The server had forgot about the order and only came after we reminded her.

Overal, the food was lacking a real Koreaness to it. Seemed to trendy for the neighbourhood of family owned shops. Lastly, the meal was quite pricy for what it was. $45 a person for 1 drink and a couple light fares. Left slightly hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas. The best I've had in Toronto. Dave's margarita is perfectly sour, but then again I don't like sweet drinks.

The tacos are amazing. They have a decent oyster selection. Yes, it's pricey, but that's the price of quality. A great place if you want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Making reservations: 5/5 
Easy to do online. Got a same day reservation for table of three at 7pm on Friday. 

Service: 3/5
Front of house service is lacking. It was my first visit, so upon entering, I stood there looking like a lost fish for a bit.. randomly saying \"hi\" to any waiter who'd look my way. They either ignored me or I was trying to dodge them while they whizzed by carrying plates of food. Fortunately, I was finally greeted and seated 5 minutes later and the rest of the night was smooth sailing. Our waiter was kind, attentive, but not intrusive. Although I add- my friend wasn't pleased that the price of featured items were not made clear. She ordered a trio of the featured halibut tacos thinking they were ~$5-6 like the regular ones. It was upon seeing the bill that she found out they were $8 a pop, and there was no deal for three. 

Food: 5/5
Table consensus- the tacos were the bomb dot com!! Fried halibut, grilled baja, fried chicken- 100% would return for more. Great ingredients, fresh fish, awesome fried chicken and wonderful flavour combinations. 

Atmosphere: 4/5
Cool interior. Place is like a long packed hallway on a Friday night. Music can be a bit loud over conversation. 

Overall we had a great time and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"There seems to be a huge number of hip (and hipster) Mexican restaurants popping up all over the city! And, I'm willing to try them all. Unfortunately, Barrio Coreano did not make the cut on my list of recommendations. I'm not Mexican nor do I claim to be an expert on Mexican food. But, in an effort to forge my credibility, I lived in New York where they have some of the best twists and takes on Mexican food...plus, I love good food!

From having read a few other reviews on Barrio, it would seem that I had some very similar experiences. We tried to make reservations at Playa Cabana, but they were all booked. According to some reviews, Barrio Coreano seems to be the fall out choice venue. If all else fails, go to Barrio Coreano.  

We started with the grilled calamari. It was great! I could taste the Mexican-Korean fusion happening in this dish. Before we even made it through our first bite, our next dish came. Baja fish tacos. The flavors were ok and spices mixed well. The batter was a little heavier than other places I've tried, of the same dish. Suddenly, our Carnita tacos arrived, and we barely got through our first two dishes. Carnita tacos are basically pulled pork. I didn't love this one. It was too dry and quite bland. 

Within 30 seconds, our next order of tacos arrived. The chicken tinga. Wait. Is this the pulled pork or the chicken? I couldn't quite tell them apart. It was recommended that we have this dish served in a hard-shell. Little did we know it was deep fried and that by the time we got around to eating it, that hard-shell taco fell apart. It was soggy and the flavors were as bland as the pulled pork. Radish garnished every single taco. I get that radish, especially pickled, is a staple ingredient in Korean dishes, but I didn't get the reasoning behind placing it on every variety of taco. Is it to hide the lack of flavor in each of these tacos? 

My friend and I are also suckers for churros so we HAD to try them, despite how incredibly stuffed we were. There is always room for churros, or so we thought. Unfortunately, they didn't come close to what churros should taste like. They were a little too soft, very heavy and extremely greasy. The caramel sauce was runny and, well, so watered down that we could barely taste the salty sweet flavors of the caramel. It was not the bang or the piece de resistance that we were hoping to leave with. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong tacos. Or, maybe we just went to the wrong Playa chain. But, I left feeling overwhelmed by the prices and underwhelmed by the food.

Having said all of this, I will always leave on a positive note and say that I liked the spaghetti western decor and the vibe. The staff was also very friendly and attentive. Our server was very knowledgeable and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable in our feelings of dismay."}
{"text":"WE LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant, the staff is amazing and the food spectacular!! This place has a funky flair and we love the decor. We also went to the other locations on Dupont...all of them so far were great and the staff are so hospitable! GO GO GO NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"With Executive Chef, Josh Stanley heading this kitchen, Barrio expands on Playa Cabana's proven successful tacos and tequila menu by adding Korean flavours, preparations and ingredients to every bite or sip. Think kimchi \"juice\" in your cocktail, and spicy Bulgogi beef in your tacos.  Sure, you can still find a few of Playa Cabana's signature items, like Dave's Margarita or their made-to-order guacamole and house-fried chips, but get ready for a few unexpected spanks on the ol' taste buds. Seriously, folks. If Mexican food is hot, and Korean food is hot, then grab your tequila folks, the K-Mex fire commands serious attention. 

The blackboard menu will change frequently to reflect the change in seasons and new kitchen creations. Right now, there will be about 5 tacos starting at $6 each (and you can order as many as you'd like), and a variety of shareable bocaditos including guacamole, jalapeno spring rolls, fried shrimp, and calamari with burnt arbol kimbi. For drinks, expect about 5 signature cocktails to make an appearance on the board, with another handful of Mexican beers, and a red and white wine available by the glass.
 
When I popped by last week for one heck of an opening media party, I got to sample some of the tasty tacos on the menu and drink my way through the cocktail options. Take a little looksy at this!

Cho-Jito: Mint, Sesame Bitters, Lime, Simple Syrup ($8)

Very refreshing!

Soju Sangria: Soju + K-Town Fruit ($8)

Way too easy to drink- it's because of stuff like this that my memory of Korea Town is so foggy.

Kequila Marma: El Jimador, Yujacha, OJ, Lime ($8)

Like a margarita for those who don't like it too sour.

Kimchi Sour: Honey JD, Lime, Kimchi Liquid ($9)

A very well balanced drink with a unique lingering aftertaste of fermentation. Don't worry if that freaks you out- it's subtle enough that it's not offensive - definitely something all kimchi lovers need to try.

Dave's Margarita: Tromba, Cointreau, Lime ($9)

The classic and probably still my favourite.

Guacamole and Chips

Prepared in a massive mortar and pestle that looks like a caldron, this must-have classic is perfection.

Yuzu Tuna Taco

I liked the hit of citrusy yuzu to cut through the richness of the fatty tuna.

Korean Beef Taco

One of my two favourites of the night. The beef was deliciously tender, but beware- that sauce does pack a punch of heat!

Grilled Octopus with Wasabi Salsa

Perfectly cooked octopus (thank you for not overcooking as so many restaurants do!) and loaded up with a sinus-clearing salsa. So delicious!

Chipotle Kampungki Chicken

Probably my favourite- light and crispy batter with an addictively spicy sauce and a creamy mayo to cut the heat underneath. Gah, craving another now.

Amazing looking, right? Thankfully, you won't have to wait too long to get this #foodporn in your mouth- you can get your Barrio Correano fix as early as November 28th. Barrio will be offering dinner service only from Wednesday- Sunday, with no reservations accepted (aka. get-there-now)."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat in Toronto. Great service and excellent food. A great combo of Mexican and Korean. All the tacos are amazing especially fish and chicken. Recent addition of BBQ items esp ribs are worth trying. Also, like all outposts of the Playa group, make the best margaritas. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had been excited to try this place since I first heard about it...a fusion of 2 of my favourites, Mexican and Korean! Was not disappointed. 

Loved the decor, with the chalkboard menus, neon signs, and white iron gates at the back...felt like we had been transported to a roadside cantina in Mexico. Got a table right away (it got much busier shortly after we arrived-it was a Saturday night at around 6). The server was great, explaining the whole menu, giving recommendations, and checking back to see how everything was going.

Our drinks (one with Korean pear, the other a special with grapefruit) were both great. The food came quickly and was all delicious. Tried most of the tacos ($5 each), our favourites were the Korean beef, the Baja fish, and the octopus with wasabi. Also got the guacamole which was fresh and flavourful, and the bbq duck tosdada-would highly recommend this! The duck was very tender and flavourful. Overall a great experience...will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had been waiting a couple of months to try this place, but kept forgetting to make a reservation.
Finally went last week on a first date, and it was a really great choice. Cool ambience, nice atmosphere and not too loud. I had requested to be seated away from door, and I'm happy I did as the traffic coming in and out was quite high.

We were promptly greeted by our server who was very friendly. She took the time to explain each item on the menu, which was helpful since I had no idea what half the words were. (Also appreciated their whole paperless schtick). Her recommendations were great. Chicken taco was tastey, Margarita's were refreshing after a long week, food was hot and delivered in a timely manner. Overall, my experience here was definitely not disappointing and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Fab fusion, fun funky vibe. Hard to pick between the tacos but the Baja fish and chicken kampungki are both delish. Note the lightness of the deep-frying."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed yet. 

1.) The entire kitchen is CELIAC safe. Everything on the menu is considered gluten free unless otherwise specified. They have separate fryers and take this kind of thing seriously. I haven't had a reaction once since going there.

2.) I can walk up whenever I feel like as I live not too far from them.

3.) Their food is great. Their homemade nachos for guac are like crack. I've enjoyed almost every taco i've had. (the braised beef and the shrimp are my go to selections). They have a smoker and, so far, everything I've had that comes out of it has been great.

4.) The staff are helpful, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Barrio Correano was great. Great food, great ambiance and most of all, amazing service! Our server truly went out of his way to make sure our meal was exactly how we wanted it. We will all definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"3/5! This is probably my least favourite of the playa cabanas. I thought the appetizers were better than our tacos. For starters I recommend the guac, ribs and K-Slaw. As a main, we ordered the chicken soft tacos (which were disappointing) and the baja fish (ok- but definitely had better). Also - be careful about the sauces - most of them are extremely spicy so don't over do it."}
{"text":"I ate there last night and I have to agree with the other yelpers. THIS PLACE IS FREEZING. STAY AWAY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. 

They said the heat was not working but I looked around and that was a lie, they do not have any heat. With the huge windows we were sitting freezing in our coats. When we asked for tea or a warm drink, our waitresses answer was that they did not have a kettle.

I also agree that the chairs were too small and uncomfortable. Good thing we were wearing our jackets because there was no where to put them.

We found the service to be genuinely unhelpful. Our waitress spent 20 minutes reading us the menu word for word (which is only written on chalkboards). 

The tacos were great though. Had the korean beef and the baja. The beef was flavourful and well cooked. The fish had a light batter and great toppings.

THIS PLACE SHOULD BE TAKE OUT ONLY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GOING THERE AND PLANNING TO SIT AND EAT IN THE WINTER. Also, if you do takeout you do not need to deal with the pushy, unpleasant waitstaff."}
{"text":"i just want to start off by saying I love playa cantina. It's one of my favourite places to go. However, I don't think i would recommend or return to Barrio Coreano. 
Maybe I was expecting too much from this restaurant, but my partner and i felt like we didn't really get to experience or taste the \"Korean\" flavours. None of the food we ordered really felt like it went together, i got the pear kimchi, smoked wings, the fried cheese taco and the chicken kampungki. for example the wasabi aoili did not compliment the chicken kampungki. The only thing we really enjoyed were the smoked wings, but I wouldn't go back just for wings. 
The service was great though, our service was very attentive and helped us out with any questions we had."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once before the menu changed and then again last night.
The food both times was very good! I'm a fan of just about all the tried tacos, the ceviche, the grilled calamari, all tasted great. The cocktails were also very good.

The menu in my opinion was difficult to read and although the old menu on the wall wasn't easy to read from certain seats in the restaurant, I preferred it thanks to it's simplicity. The new menu seemed cluttered and overwhelming much like the restaurant can feel when it's busy.

The tables are very very small. Too small for two people when the food is coming out of the kitchen every 3 mins. The service was so friendly, I would suggest that the wait staff ask us if we want the food altogether (too much for the table) or to come out little by little.
I appreciated how quickly the food arrived but it was stressful to try to make space with the people at our next table just inches away staring while we struggled. 
We ordered ceviche, (two bowls, one for chips and one for the dish) calamari, two tacos each, cocktails plus the water & jug and a dish on the table for sauce etc. There was not enough room. 

So the point is, order as you eat or you'll have food on your lap with a displacement server (not the friendly wait staff but the actual food server) who doesn't seem to realize there's no room. 

Otherwise a great visit. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The place had a Mexican feel as soon as I walked in. The bar looked amazing with it's crazy collection of tequila.

The Starters (guacamole) was to die for. I could have just eaten that and gone home satisfied. I also got the Kalbi steak and it was a Korean dish with a Mexican twist.
The rest of the Mexican food had the Korean flavors to it.only problem was the portions which weren't that large. So we had to order quite a few dishes

Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Just amazing. I celebrated my birthday at Barrio Coreano last night with a large group and the restaurant did everything they could to make it perfect! It's a small space but they tucked us in a corner and we were very comfortable. We had a fixed menu with guac, slaw (out of this world), kolbi beef ribs, three types of tacos, all followed by a tres leches cake and churro poutine. Such an amazing fusion of flavours! Thanks to Court and Lisa for making the night a hit!"}
{"text":"I loved the ambience and setting. Very cozy and relaxing place. This review is solely based on the desserts only. We came here strictly for desserts. The Churro poutine was very creative idea, but our churro was over deep fried and burnt ( the server even said that the cook gave us an extra churro - no thanks). The tres leche cake tastes good, but the fresh cream on top was over whipped and started to separate when we got the order. The milk ice cream was good. 
I will be back for the food next time"}
{"text":"En feu. En fuego. En ratza. Ar dân.

These are just a few ways to describe Barrio Coreano, and particularly their pulpo taco, a culinary exploration of the combined power of octopus and salsa. All tacos come with a choice of 1 or 3, and paired with the excellent chips and guacamole, one order is perfect. Perfect, truly.

The companion restaurants have, in the foggy and addled memory of this reporter, lived up to the standard set here, but the oyster option sets Barrio apart. Who doesn't love oysters? Well, a friend of mine doesn't - he's allergic to shellfish and keeps using his friend Ana Phylaxis as an excuse to get out of eating them. But other than him, who?

So if you find yourself wandering Koreatown in need of a great Mexican bite, look no further. And if you see this Ana person, tell her to get over shellfish."}
{"text":"My favourite fish tacos! I've travelled quite a bit and try fish tacos everywhere I go and nothing compares. The fusion is awesome. Love this place."}
{"text":"If you decide to come here, make sure you have reservations.  Otherwise don't bother.  The menu is on the wall, or off of the waitress' head, the bar is in the middle of restaurant between two dining areas, and there is no place to wait for a table (besides the bar which is tight) if you don't have reservations.  Coming from an Asian background, the food is pretty much \"Asian\" in a taco.  To me, the other Playa Cabana's had better food.  But I still enjoyed myself here, except for the bar.  The bar had enough stools to seat 8 people.  If you stand, you're in the path of the waiters between the dining area and the kitchen.  Terrible setup in my opinion.  Our server was wonderful.  Tried a little too hard to be funny, but can't blame her for trying.

Service: 4
Food: 3
Atmosphere: 3.5
Overall Experience: 3.5

The negative part about this place is definitely the bar.  No room to stand if you're waiting for a table, which is why I say you better have reservations if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"One of the best ribeyes I've ever had. Price was decent, perfectly seasoned and cooked. $39 for 2 lbs. Split between a table, it was plenty. I thought the appetizers were a little small for what the price was. $9 for 2 small pieces of fried chicken isn't exactly cheap. But the tacos and shareable mains were totally ample. The charcuterie taco was dry and the sausage was impossible to bite through. The kalbi was good but a little on the dry side again. The chorizo taco was the best for sure. We all agreed. The most filling, the most interesting ingredients and the least dry. And they grill the tortilla so it's a hard taco. I could've eaten 5 of these alone. 

The best part of the place was the service. Our server (dark haired sassy female with bangs) explained the menu thoroughly and was really informative. She made us hungry just by talking about the food. She was attentive, personable but also had a sense of humour. I am really sick of smaller joints with pseudo versions of ethnic dishes but with not a lot of experience in cooking techniques. This place at least knows how to deep fry and things come out fast and piping hot. She boasted about the dishes and they lived up to the hype. I will definitely be returning. It's rare to find a place that has food with so much flavour.

And calling in was a breeze. The reservation person was friendly and accommodating. The cooks, other servers and bar staff all had smiles and made me feel welcomed. Send ALL other new casual hipster restaurants to this place to see how service should be done. Thank you for a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Overall, the meal was decent, but nothing to write home about.

First, the service was abysmal. I'm not sure if the server was having a bad day or she was just a bitch - hard to tell. When we were seated, she asked my friend and I if we had eaten there before. My friend answered that she had been there once before but that it was my first time. So our brilliant waitress says, \"OK, so you can give her the rundown of the menu then\" and proceeds to walk away. Um... ok. So we look at the menu (on a chalkboard and not easy to read) and decide to go for the calamari app and some tacos. It would have been nice to know a bit more about the ingredients in the tacos, but alas I guess that would have been a bit too much work. Once our waitress finally returned to take our orders, my friend ordered for us. After taking our food order, she asked if we wanted anything to drink. I wanted to have a beer, so I inquired about Tecate. I am not a huge beer drinker, so I asked her the following question, \"Is Tecate a light beer?\". Her response? With an annoyed tone and facial expression, mind you, \"Well, it comes in a tall boy can.\" Confused, I tried to as her again, this time saying, \"Is Tecate a light beer like the Dos XX Lager or is it a darker beer? Again, I got such attitude, telling me that it's not light in colour. Like, what the hell. If you don't know the answer, say let me find out, I don't know - don't tell me what kind of a can the beer comes in and treat a paying customer like a moron. Anyhow, suffice to say her attitude was shitty and put a damper on the evening. My friend was very confused by her as well.

As for the food, it was fine. The calamari was OK, nothing special and lacked flavour, in my opinion. It was also kind of tepid, which wasn't that appealing. The tacos were good, although I found them overpriced for the portion and honestly, with all of the amazing taco places in the city, they just didn't compare. Our favourites were the Chorizo, the Queso and the Fish, all of which were very tasty. 

What else? 10 minutes after eating our last taco, we realised we never got the Kalbi beef taco so asked our server if it was on it's way. \"Oh yeah\" and left, only to return with it 30 seconds later. Thanks! We decided to have dessert, the flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream was calling our name, so we decided to order that. But wouldn't you know, our waitress was nowhere to be found. Oh wait, there she is, cleaning cutlery and folding napkins while we sit there, empty plates around us for over 15 minutes. Honestly, I know I am complaining a lot in this review about the service, but it was truly terrible and off putting. I realise this is a new, hip resto and service isn't the main focus, but I would never return because of it. When we finally got the chance to order our dessert, and it finally arrived, it was tasty. Very light and fluffy and the green tea ice cream was a nice touch.

So, all in all, I think the food is good, the dessert was very good and the service was poor. I had previously been to Playa Cabana Hacienda, and liked the atmosphere, service and food there much more. 

Would have been a 4 star and a possible repeat visit if not for the quality of the service."}
{"text":"This place was the first stop in a series of quick hit-and-run visits across the Christie/Bathurst neighbourhood in Toronto. The atmosphere was very inviting! Neon signs and large chalkboards on the walls, classic 90s hip hop playing on the speakers. I knew that this was going to be good.

The restaurant doesn't use paper menus, but instead has their entire menu displayed on the chalkboards throughout the restaurant and behind the bar. A nice touch, I thought. (Although, this may be sightly inconvenient depending on where you choose to sit.)

We started off with two beers while we took a look at the menu for a couple of minutes before settling on the lobster tostada, Korean lamb ribs and Baja fish taco. The dishes were served Tapas-style, which was perfect for us. If you're looking for a full meal, definitely look at ordering a few portions. 

The lobster tostada had a nice balance of flavour and was topped off with a generous amount of avocado on top. I'm not an avocado-guy, but it worked nicely with this dish. The tostada was crispy and the lobster was delicious.

The lamb ribs were tender and very tasty as well. They were dressed with a barbecue sauce that was not too sweet and not too tangy either. 

The fish taco was easily my favourite of the three dishes we ordered. It was packed full of flavour even without adding any extra sauce or dressing on top. Pleasantly surprising, indeed. 

Overall, while our visit was short, it definitely left a very positive impression. The service was very friendly and welcoming, no issues or complaints there. Would certainly love to come back here for a longer stay and to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Cocktails are pretty good. 

Tacos are good, not amazing. 

Service...barely any. 

Desserts: gross. 

We sent back the tres leches cake which we all have had many times at other places because it was GROSS. I told our server and she apologized took it away (we had a couple bites) yet for some reason we were still charged for it. Hmmm. Not going back."}
{"text":"Finally a real restaurant to break the depressing monotony of cheap sushi Bloor St. Welcoming and vibrant atmosphere (loud but tolerably so). Tried seven tacos, each an explosion of fresh ingredients, especially the namesake fusion versions (barrio coreano is koreatown). Sole complaint: margarita wasn't great"}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was top notch. The ceviche was creative, the tacos were ace and the service was everything I could have ever hoped for. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We were randomly walking along Bloor St to find something to eat. My friend saw this place and there is always a line up but as we were early, there wasn't that many people so we decided to try. We started off with a cocktail - very strong AVERNA DE LA FAMILIA - Jose Cuervo Tradicionel, Averna, Lemon, Honey, Ginger Beer. I was ok but my friend was quite tipsy after the drink. Next, we got some GUACAMOLE AND CHIPS - chips was freshly fried and fresh guacamole. Also, we got K-MEX SLAW - Korean Cabbage, Avocado, Corn, Queso Fresco, Pineapple-Ginger Dressing. This is the first time I have this korean / mexican salad, but it was delicious. I love the sauce.

Finally, the main tacos arrived. Between the 3 of us, we got 3 different types of taco and it was enough for us for sure. We were very full at the end. BAJA FISH - fried, guac kimchi joven - this was our favourite. Big chucks of fish fried and pour with sauce and kimchi to add a little kick. This was spicy enough for me but my friends piled on the extra spices. BRAISED SHORT-RIB - braised Beef in Ancho-Guajillo, Mole Rojo - now I know it is hard to eat with a crispy taco, everything spilled everywhere so it was pretty messy but in a good way. CHORIZO VERDE - poblano Chile Cured Pork. I didn't like this one as much as it was not as much things in the taco.

Next time, I would for sure go back for the Baja fish and tried the other ones. They are all so good. My only complaint is that our tables were on high stools so no where to put my purse except on the floor."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! I went here for dinner with some friends and it was so super yummy - we tried a whack of dishes, drank delicious wine, enjoyed a super-friendly server and a cool atmosphere. Would definitely love to go again!"}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours, rarely checked on by the server, dessert never came, supervisor didn't know how to do a refund, no manager. Needless to say I won't be back.

Step up your game Barrio, you're overpriced with mediocre service."}
{"text":"Went here before around 8ish at night with my friend for the first time, but when we got in the lady said that they are fully booked and we have to wait til 10pm to be seated.  We were hungry so we left even though we really want to try their food.

But last night, our long wait is over. We pass by the restaurant and their interior lighting caught our attention so we had to get in and try their food. We didnt have to wait this time and we were seated immediately.  The interior has rustic feel with alot of different lighting. The restaurant has a chill vibe to it and good for hanging out with friends. But it could get loud with music and if it's packed. They dont have the typical menu that is written on a paper, their menus are written on a blackboard with their pricing on the side. The waiter explained to us everything and recommended some of his favorites which I think is really nice gesture.

We ordered different things out of their menus to have varieties. Here are the list of what we ordered:
* lobster tacoladas
*kalbi beef taco
*spicy carnita taco
*baja fish taco
*deaji bbq taco
*chorizo verde
*grilled calamari
*flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream
*fried ice cream

Their food are absolutely AMAZING!! We finished everything with nothing left on our plate :) if you love spicy food, spicy carnita is a taco to order. It has habañero sauce and diced habañero. For dessert we did not regret ordering thier fried ice cream and flourless chocolate cake!!  They are to die for!! 

Their servings are good for one person with reasonable price range.  Each taco price ranges from $5-$6. The lobster and grilled calamari are about $9-$12. Their desserts are $10. 

This place is a good find and will definitely recommend it to all my friends!! You'll surely come back for more!! But make sure to make reservations or come early as this place gets really busy."}
{"text":"Tacos in Koreatown? Yes, and boy do they do it well. It's a hole-in-the-wall place with an awesome vibe, great beer selection and terrific service. Oh and did I mention the tacos are amazing? 

There's a wall of the day's specials and I'd highly recommend the Baja Fish Tacos; crunchy, savory and flavorful. Only word of advice, get a reservation and make sure to order at least three tacos, as they're a bit on the smaller side.

If you're out with friends or looking for a good place to start your night, Barrio is always a stellar choice. Highly recommend it, tacos fan or no, it's delicious all the way 'round."}
{"text":"Came on a very busy sat night. Highly recommend making reservations. Place is very narrow and long, very dimly lit but the food is amazing. We ordered most of the items on the menu for sharing and the top favourites were: grilled spicy calamari, k-mex slaw, Baja fish taco and wings.  Don't forget the dessert - churros with warm leches..omg!!!  Service was amazing and food came out fast and hot!  Sorta pricy but totally worth it!! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place I really wanted to try it out and fall in love with it. 

The decor of the place is fun and eclectic.The room is  quite small and it does get pretty cold during those bone chilling days of winter. Dress in layers!!
We shared a couple of apps
The ceviche was sweet and was my least favourite dish. I'm from Peru and I'm used to having my ceviche savory and super sour not watermelony and soggy.
The most memorable  dish was the guacamole which was literally being made right beside us ( we had a table right by the kitchen)The portion was very generous and the tortilla chips are unlimited.
We tried 3 different types of tacos which were ok nothing to rave about.
The cocktails were weak and pricey.
Overall not impressed.
I really did like their playlist though"}
{"text":"We booked via open table but it looks like that there was some confusion with the host that I got an email that I did not show up. They were in a hurry to get us out and did not even offer us desserts. It was one of those services that made you feel regret for tipping even just 1%. Food is mediocre, over price and over hype. The kampungki chicken was basically one of those KFC fried chicken from across the street. It did not have the thick spicy red sauce that it should have. Kalbi taco and bulgogi taco are a rip off. It costs $6/taco for 3 bites of meat. If you go to any of the korean restaurant surrounding it, $6 would have gotten you a gigantic place of meat with rice and refillable side dishes."}
{"text":"Damn good tacos and damn good ribs. The cocktails are also pretty amazing! Only thing they're missing is fried chicken"}
{"text":"Great food best Korean Mexican tacos. Bright interior but it's a good change. Shrimp was good so was the chicken tacos. Be careful of the hot sauce,  excellent but unexpected."}
{"text":"There's a new hot eatery in Koreatown! Barrio Coreano, by the creators of Playa Cabana, has situated itself among Korean family restaurants in the area and taking the neighbourhood by storm.  My visit was on a Thursday night as a walk in (as online booking was full) and was lucky enough to get a seat!

The restaurant definitely stands out from the rest of the stores and eateries in the few blocks of bloor between Christie and Bathurst streets.  You won't be able to just walk past this hip & urban space, decorated with interesting details and neon, flashing lights.  The chalk board menus, rustic metal chairs, bowling alley signs and overall grungy mood of the space made me feel like I was in a back alley after party - LOVE!

Onto the food, which is Mexican like Playa Cabana's there other restaurants in the City, but with Korean influence in most of their dishes.  I couldn't wait to try.

 Chips & Guac was a nice appetizer to nibble on with our drinks while we waited for our entrees.  Freshly made guacamole is served generously. Highly recommended!
 
Grilled Calamari with burnt arbol kimchi was perfection.  We ordered this upon our server's recommendation and we love her for it.  It's no wonder why it's the most popular appetizer there!

 We ordered two tacos: first was the Chipotle Chicken Kampungki.  'Kampungki' is a popular Korean chicken dish that is battered with its sgnatured sweet & spicy sauce.  Barrio Coreano did a great job integrating that flavour into their menu.  The crispy battered chicken pieces (of which there were plenty of) with spicy, creamy mayo, green onions, onions, jalapenos and radish complemented each other tastefully.

 Second taco was the Korean Beef (Galbi) Taco with radish, lettuce, green onions and shredded carrots.  This too was deliciously addictive with perfectly marinated and tender beef pieces.  Two thumbs up!

 I can't be happier that this late-night eatery slash dinner restaurant opened up in Koreatown, so accessible on the Bloor street subway line.  With their intriguing daily specials and unique cocktails with Korean touches, I know it won't be too long until my next visit - so eager to try the 3 other Tacos that I missed out on my first visit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dived into this joint after being drawn in by the neon pink lighting. We were seated too close for comfort to another couple. The place was extremely loud which was kind of expected, but we figured the food/drinks would make up for not being able to have a conversation. The vibe was confusing...Korean? Mexican? Hiphop hot box studio? We asked the waitress for appetizer recommendations - too rushed to care she just said to try the ceviche. We ordered two drinks which took about 30 minutes to arrive
- a sangria which was blah and some martini which consisted of 80% shaved ice. Our ceviche sucked big time. Our bill came to $50. Waste, won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite out of the Playa Cabana restaurants.  Relaxed vibe, hip hop music, great food, reasonable prices!

We made reservations for Friday night a few days in advance and were able to get a table without a problem.

Food

Grilled spicy calamari - delicious! this was probably my favourite item on the menu.. definitely has a kick to it. and a HUGE portion!

Charcoal grilled chicken wings - good smokey flavour, about 8 or 9 wings in an order

Braised short rib taco - super tender with guacamole and cheese

Chicken Kampunki taco - large portion of chicken! the taco couldn't even close without taking more than half the chicken out

Shrimp taco - this wasn't great.. tasted like small frozen shrimps marinated in a spicy sauce.. I wouldn't try this again

Didn't have room for dessert - ordered way too much food! Certainly will go back for the calamari, chicken kampunki, and dessert!!

overall a great place!"}
{"text":"Didn't make it to 5/5 stars because it is a very loud restaurant, so not great to go with more than 2 people, and that because of the layout, each table and seats are very different, leaving you sometimes to seat in less comfortable seating arrangement. 
The Korean-mexican fusion is at first confusing and interesting, and the waiter was extremely friendly and patient when choosing what we would eat. We had the baja fish soft tacos, as recommended by our waiter, and were extremely pleased with the choice. The kimchi went surprisingly well with the perfectly batter-fried fish. 
We then had the BEST dessert; the churro poutine. I had tried it at Playa Cabana-Hacienda, which is another restaurant of this chain, and absolutely loved it. was at first worried it wouldn't be as good as in the other location, but it was just as divine - definitely make some space for dessert here!"}
{"text":"I come here way too often. 

Amazing food and great servers. 

Try the special pork ribs, the fish taco's, and Dave's margarita!"}
{"text":"This place kills it with tacos. I could have them all the time. Guac and chips were amazing - the chips were freshly deep fried and so crispy. I think they were even dumpling wrappers. Had the carnitaz de maciza and baja fish tacos and they were mouthwatering. I want to try the bulgogi shrimp el diablo. Must go back!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the food is pretty good. The service was attentive for a large group. The short braised rib taco was the top taco of our group. Their red snapper fish tacos were also good but expensive ($9 for one)! Guacamole was average but the chips were tasty. For an appetizer get the spicy kimchi pear calamari (perfect combination of sweet, tangy and spicy). The churros poutine is definitely worth getting as well. Overall it's a place to come with friends for good food and fun music. Not the best tacos in the city but a place worth trying."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere AND food!
Bartenders were very nice and friendly even when it got very crowded. They have their original cocktails, which are nice if you feel adventurous.

Nice variety of oysters to enjoy as well.

It gets busy very quick on Friday nights, which tells you something about the place!"}
{"text":"Big fan of tacos so decided to give this place a try. Place is kinda small so seating is close. The decor is very vintage looking. Tacos are a little expensive but the quality and taste are very good. You MUST MUST MUST get a house margarita, very balanced very tasty! Tacos are priced by 1 or 3 so you can mix and match. They also have a \"smoked\" menu which changes. The Asian pear kimchi is good but too spicy for my taste. 
What I didn't like was the tacos took a long time to come out and they came out separately (felt like forever between the two). All in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Best civiche, such a large amount! I loved it! The shrimp tacos are to die for and there are so many other options that are lovely spins on common classics!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO GOOD. Cocktails and food was all off the charts! I am not usually a dessert person but definitely try the chocolate/churro thing, can't recall what it was called however it was awesome. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I would give it a full 5 stars, but one of the times I came the service was a bit slow (it was quite busy) so the full 5 stars seemed a bit generous.

The tacos here are great! Full of flavour and interesting combinations and textures. The decor is wild - but in a really fun and casual way. The service is friendly and knowledgeable - but as I said, one time a bit slow. No fault of the server.

They also have a nice selection of cocktails and exotic juices. Oh - and the tres leches cake is to die for!

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A mad spicy pulpo taco
A soggy mess
A decent cevice
A heavenly order of chips
A proper bbq-agave sauce

Well

Let's summarize:

Pulpo Charcoal Taco: Strong character, great spicy kick, smoky-right, proper. Needs to be more juicy. They do not know the secret about the tortilla taco! It is really simple.

Sea Brim Taco: Soggy, needs double tortilla and those pickles in Julienne. 

Ceviche Yucatan: Simple and delicious, the fish tastes just right. Lacks of herbs and other proper spices that Ceviche usually has.

The chips: The only stellar item

Bbq ribs with bbq-agave sauce: This is what I am talking about!

Funny fact: Tacos el asador next door feels more honest with their offerings and portions

Sad fact: Cramped, cramped, cramped

Win fact: The servers, ay ay ay!"}
{"text":"Service was good but tacos fell apart and got soggy really quickly. Odd to say but there were too many toppings and that made it a mess to eat. The short ribs were delicious!"}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced with a gimmicky approach for fusion food that claims authenticity but doesn't quite pull it off. The decor was overwrought. The servers have their schtick down for orienting you to the gist but then forgot lots of details, abandoned us for extended periods, and weren't able to help us gauge how much food was reasonable (the sharing entrees were too small, the tacos teeny and the desserts were too big and should've been shared). The guac was made fresh right behind us so it could've been a mindblower but was just decent. The cocktails were well executed flavour wise, but again, small for the $$. I would take El Asador's right up the block any day of the week for the real deal version of what these folks are posing as."}
{"text":"Read below to hear about the food (3/5) and the atmosphere (4.5/5) which I would rate pretty differently.  

You can buy one Taco individually, or you can buy three of them for a combo price. I ordered the Bulgogi, Grilled Baja Fish and the Fried Baja Fish Taco. My friends have been really liking tacos lately, and I've found that you can almost never go wrong with the fish tacos. I found that the tacos were just 'alright', and that they really weren't amazing. Of the three, I think the Fried Fish was the best - but even then it wasn't that great (maybe I don't like Baja as much?) and didn't have that much flavour. The bulgogi was quite bare as well, I guess I was expecting something a bit richer, but it basically tasted how you'd think it would taste. And lastly the grilled fish, actually may have had more flavour than the fried one, since it seemed to be a bit spicy (no tolerance for spice)? 

On the other hand - this restaurant/ bar has great vibes. It was full when I went, so we sat at the bar. It's pretty loud, which I've seen some people rate negatively, but I actually liked it! Seemed like the place was buzzing with energy. Also the staff were awesome and friendly and they all looked like they were having a great time. 

Basically I'd come here again as somewhere to hang out, but there are better tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here with 13 guests. The staff was very helpful during the reservation process for large groups. The food was great! Vegans and carnivores were pleased. We were never waiting for food and drinks. The price was good considering that we got appetizers, tacos and (too much) dessert. The music and atmosphere was great too so we were singing and eating. All 13 guests were pleased with the food and service. Thank you for a great birthday dinner!!"}
{"text":"Barrio Correano offers a fresh take on the Korean-Mexican mash-up that has been happening south of the border for some time. A fun atmosphere, funky decor, uber-friendly staff and good cocktails help it all go down. 

Correano has no printed menus. Instead diners have to crane their necks to look at several wall-mounted chalkboards. Luckily on my visit with my partner, our bubbly waitress was there to explain every item on the menu for us.

The server took pains to explain that it was a \"sharing\" menu, which is funny given how common these places have become. I suppose some diners still expect a big plate with steak, a baked potato and salad for themselves!

The menu favours the Mexican end of the Korean-Mexican fusion spectrum, so we started with an excellent guacamole and home-made tortilla chips, that were just greasy enough. Definitely no Baked Lays going on here.

I had a Hemingway cocktail with Mount Gay rum and grapefruit, among other things. It was refreshing, not too sweet, and a nice start to the meal.

Most of our meal came from the tacos selection, including a delicious chorizo verde, and a batter-fried shrimp one, that was spicy and very filling. The more Korean-inspired chicken kampungki was similar to General Tso battered chicken on wasabi mayo in a blue corn soft taco -- good components alone, but they didn't mesh that well in this case.

We also shared the portobello fajitas which combined meaty mushrooms and fajita veggies on a hot platter with soft corn tacos, and more of the awesome guac and house-made pico de gallo salsa. The fajitas were not as special as some of the other tacos, but were a good choice to share, and also for the veg-minded.

The food is deceptively filling. After sharing the guac & chips, the three tacos and fajitas, neither of us had any room for dessert. It's too bad as I love a good tres leches cake, but that will have to wait until next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Playa Cabana before and LOVED IT. I decided to try out this place with two others since it's under the same chain of restaurants. The decor was super cool! loved all the fixtures and lighting. We ordered:

Gaucomole and chips
3 tacos of beef ribs
1 lobster 
2 chicken kumpinski? (Lol)
1 chicken tinga
2 fish tacos (one grilled and one fried)

All of the tacos were decent side but they all fell apart. Like, lower the sauces because I came here to eat tacos, not use my knife and fork. Come on. My fish taco fell apart and I had to ask for another taco. 

The best taco was definitely the chicken kumpinski and chicken tinga. So delicious! The beef rib tacos were the ones I was looking forward to the most but they were a bit disappointing.  I tasted the lobster and it was a bit chewy, not bad. 

I thought they could do better..compared to Playa Cabana. I get that it's a Korean Mexican fusion but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Good fusion between Mexican and Korean cuisine. Ordered the short rib and shrimp tacos alongside the torta (sandwich).  I was actually shocked that ingredients from both cuisines blended so well together. The shrimp taco was wonderful. Good balance of acidity, saltiness and spiciness. The short rib taco had more Korean traits than Mexican traits.  The torta was great as well. Mix between a banh mi and panini with a little Mexican flare added to it. Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was unique. Will come back."}
{"text":"Not up to the hype. Started with Guac & Chips ($9) and Charcoal Smoked Wings ($14). House-made chips were crispy lime dusted deliciousness but the guac was boring.  Wings were excellent and the highlight of the meal (smoky crisp and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbs).  

We ordered 3 soft shell Chicken Kampungki tacos ($13), 3 soft shell Pulpo Al Carbon tacos($16), and 3 crispy shell Braised Short Rib tacos ($13) to share.  The chicken pieces were awesomely crispy but needed a drizzle of kampungki sauce or something to wake it up a bit.  The octopus was a chewy stringy confusion of forgettable flavours.  Only the braised short rib taco was delicious but by the time I got to it, the shell was dripping in room temp frying oil (they really should have been plated on top of something to absorb the excess oil).  

Nothing on the menu tasted even remotely Korean.  Not even a single drizzle of korean red pepper paste anywhere.  No idea why this place is categorized as Korean Mexican fusion.  Should just be called \"Mexican fusion\""}
{"text":"Went a few nights ago and left very happy and full. Barrio coreano does not provide menus, instead the full menu is written on chalkboards on the walls. However because of how we were seated it was very difficult to read the menu and order.
We started with the homemade guac and chips, and shared the kalbi beef, baja fish, chicken kampungki, and fried queso chihuahua tacos. Kalbi beef was okay, it wasn't anything too spectacular. The other three tacos were really yummy and I highly recommend trying them. The baja fish was extremely juicy - not dry at all - with tons of flavour and a great sauce. The chicken kampungki had a great kick to it - also a great fusion of flavour. The fried queso chihuahua is actually deep fried cheese with a popular korean side dish oi muchim.
Overall a great meal, and great for sharing. The tacos can be ordered in singles or trios, which allows you to try quite a few if you have a group of 4-5 people. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good food reflecting the Korean-Mexican fusion theme, but the prices were a bit high for the quality of items and price of ingredients."}
{"text":"Definitely a great addition to the Annex eatery list. Sticks out like a sore thumb in Koreatown but in a good way. Took my cousin there for her birthday last night and we loved it. It was a Friday night so it was very busy and we were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait for a table so we decided to just sit at the bar. Ended up working out great because we got to watch the 2 handsome bartenders serve up very interesting drink. We ordered 2 tacos each: my cousin had the chorizo taco & Baja Fish and I had the general tao & the baja. They are on the smaller side but they are worth the $5 price tag. They packed just the right amount of heat and left us both wanting more. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"OK, I have a prediction.....Korean-Mexican food will be the next big thing.  It sounds crazy (Korean pickled veggies & such on tacos with some traditional Mexican ingredients) but it really works.  There are about 7 tacos to choose from and many other dishes (ribs, guac) that tend to lean more toward the Korean or Mexican side.  Really good cocktails too, but you will go broke at these prices.  Our group of 5 managed to snag reservations on a Friday night with just a few hours notice.  It is tiny and can feel packed, but it was Friday night after all."}
{"text":"I've had this place on my bookmark list quite sometime - likely ever since I absolutely fell in love with the junction location (Cantina). The rustic/industrial decor, the fast, friendly and knowledgeable staff and, most of all the amazing  food. 

The other Playa Cabana locations are definitely pure Mexican as a majority with hints of other cuisine here and there. However, If the neighborhood didn't give it away, This spot is basically the Canadian born offspring of a Mexican and Korean. The local Korean neighborhood influence on the menu, from bulgogi shrimp tacos, to kimchi to a style of Korean fried chicken (in a taco) that I can't even pronounce. 

The decor is true to the brand, as mentioned it's a rustic, vintage look, kind of a hodgepodge of antique and garbage. My friend commented that this looked like a cartel hangout in Mexico... That was owned by a Korean family. 

For food we started with a few shareable apps amongst the 5 of us. Grilled calamari (so spicy but so amazingly delicious), Korean style short ribs (so meaty, lots of fat but I was glad we we're sharing because it was too salty for my taste to eat a whole portion), and the guacamole (because it's Plays Cabanas brainchild and obvi). 

For mains I went with 3 tacos (a classic move and really the only smart choice). I had the Korean fried chicken taco who's name is longer than I could pronounce, the bulgogi shrimp taco and the cabanas signature taco the beef short rib (although it fits in here more than any of the other locations). 

Service was pretty good and food was flying quick. The single bathroom was a bit odd with its vintage pinball game over the toilet (I would play it even if it did work - you only have so many hands in a bathroom as a guy and at one point or another they're both \"occupied\"). 

Cocktails were awesome I had the Mezcal mule (a couple of times) which is basically a superior mule and makes the original taste like 'ass' (get it). Followed up by a couple rounds of corona and our night was set. 

Well done. I approve and will return for that calamari app and 3 rounds of bulgogi shrimp tacos! Yum!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance yesterday to try this place. It was pretty empty at around 530pm Thursday evening. Customer service was great.  Now the food-

1) Baja fish tacos - delicious ! Crispy fish, very flavorful.

2) Braised ribs crispy tacos - still pretty good, but too spicy for me. My cousin enjoyed this more than the fish tacos, but I prefer the fish tacos. 

3) Was going to give it a 4 until I tried their kalbi beef which I find too salty and oily. The texture was soft and juicy though :)

The drinks - \"No Love\" , watermelon gin was sweet and not too strong which is perfect for me!!

Overall ambience was chilled and very friendly staff. I would not mind coming back again and try their other food, but maybe with more people as it's pretty pricy!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to eat in Toronto. I would have never imagined I would call tacos my favourite food, but now couldn't imagine anything ever surpassing them. Be it their braised beef, chicken kampungi, or Baja fish taco, (among many other delicious options) I am completely blown away. They also offer fresh menu items smoked daily in house which make choosing a single dinner option even more difficult. This top notch cuisine, paired with excellent cerveza, or hand crafted cocktails, all served by warm, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff, makes them a stand out in the city, and a must try experience."}
{"text":"My fave is the chihuahua cheese tacos!!! Their chips & guac's a good way to start your meal. So appetizing! Must go, def!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences in the city.
The food is pretty good. Tacos are well done, but not Korean at all. The tamale is extremely overpriced. 9 dollars for a small tamale with 3 tiny pieces of pork???
This place would get 3 stars if it wasn't for how abhorrent the service was.
We were sitting in the back, which seemed to be the area where only those who knew the owner were at. We waited 40 minutes for our food while people who had sat down way later than us were getting all kinds of food.
Our server disappeared while the owner or manager was obnoxiously hugging people and yelling and being pretentious.
It's so packed and busy that at some points people were literally leaning on our table and having conversations.
We almost walked out, seeing how long we were waiting but then we got some of our order.
The chairs are so small and tables so packed together that one of the servers almost knocked me off my chair while trying to get through. Extremely uncomfortable.
Finally, we didn't get everything we ordered, as I assume our order was mixed up. Our server never addressed how long we were waiting or that he had forgotten our order.
We didn't even tell the server because we wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.
Maybe on a quieter night it would have been a better experience, but coming into a restaurant and obviously seeing the owner/server's friends getting food immediately while waiting for over half an hour is so disrespectful, I will never come again.
Tacos are good, but with places like Grand Electric, Seven Lives and La Carnita, it's not something I couldn't do without."}
{"text":"Closest thing to easting in a washroom you'll find. Came here on a Saturday night. 

Pros 
- Allow you to make reservations 

Cons
- Slowest service I've had my whole life. Our APPETIZERS took 45 minutes to arrive. 
- None of the food was brought out at the same time. Everyone ate separately while the others watched 
- Average food and we'll overpriced. 
- Ambiance was that of a prison washroom. 

Would NOT recommend nor will I step foot in this dump again."}
{"text":"I love korean mexican fusion food!
The ambiance of this resto bar is very nice too. I have recommended this place to many friends and they all like it.
It gets very busy on Friday nights though so make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp galbi taco and it was ah-maxing. You have an option of 1 or 3 so we got 3 and shared between a friend and I. I quickly regretted that decision as I would have wanted all to myself had I not have eaten just before coming here. 

We also got the guac and chips. First round of chips were perfect. Second round was a bit too salty so we left it. 

Friend and I both go the Sangrias which were good and strong-ish. 

The bar stool style chairs are a bit comfortably and on an angle for some reason so was not the best. Tripped and fell into a vent that was not covered next to my seat. The phone is on ring volume too mother freaking loud it kept disrupting our conversation and scared me the first time. No seriously guys it's too loud. 

Staff is really friendly and would def come back!!! Possible to sit on another seat. They came back often enough to see how everything was going with the food but noticed a delay in a few tables with paying the bill but they apologized and that's the important part right?"}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but I have a general issue with their customer service. When seated, my party was told there was a time limit on how long we could sit there. I understand they were up front about this policy, but that doesn't make it good customer service. After we paid our bill, we were given about 10-15 minutes before the general manager came over to ask us to leave. 

They claimed to have a party that needed our table. However, they had a large empty table beside us, and they could have repositioned tables to seat that party and let us finish our drinks at a slower pace until the larger party arrived. Again, this is their policy, but it's just a reflection of disorganization and lazy management. Not good customer service. 

The food was good but not good enough to justify this type of hoity toity attitude. We had the smoked ribs which were good but had a lot of sauce that overpowered the smoke flavour. The short rib tacos were also really greasy. These tacos are some of the best in Toronto, but I have definitely had far superior tacos in other cities."}
{"text":"Went twice. First time: five stars; second time, one star. I couldn't believe the inconsistency. I thought this was going to be my new favorite restaurant, went back two or three weeks later (couldn't wait), and I may never go back. Calamari was spectacular the first time, but the second time was so salty, I couldn't eat it. (Thankfully, they took it off the bill.) Chicken taco was perfect the first time, all skin and batter the second time. Very sad."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place for a dinner party, I'd suggest Barrio Coreano.

It's an amazing Mexican / Korean Fusion, smashing together tastes that give your mouth a good time. 

We started with cocktails, (in which I may have had a few... ) all of which were delightful. - I also sampled several... I feel like it was my duty to make sure all was well!

Then we shared Korean Short ribs and salsa with guacamole. 

For Tacos, might I suggestion, the Kalbi Beef,  Fried Queso Chihuaha and my PERSONAL FAVOURITE... CHORIZO VERDE remember that good time in your mouth... Chorizo Verde all the way.

The decor is eclectic and the staff were exceptional. 

They don't do separate bills for big parties but the prices are so right, it's worth just splitting!"}
{"text":"4 Stars - excellent service, relaxing atmosphere and great food. A perfect combo!

Service was excellent during my visit on a busy Saturday night. Our server was incredibly friendly and constantly checked in on us. All the food & drinks arrived at a perfect pace. 

They have an excellent Oyster selection with about 10-15 options. Of course, not all are available at one time. We had a dozen and they were spot on delicious. Also probably the best shucked oysters I ever had - Kudos to the staff. 

In house Guac and Salsa were yummy with fresh baked chips. 

Next up was the grilled calamari. An excellent dish, very fresh and tender. I did find it a little spicy for my taste but pushed through as the core product was cooked perfectly. 

Now for the tacos. Their menu is split between soft and hard shell options. You can't interchange the shells, certain selections must be on hard shell (probably becuase they would be too messy otherwise).

First up was the grilled Baja fish taco. Good size, soft shell, fresh fish with flavorful toppings. As a fish taco, this was about average given some of the great taco spots in the city (nothing beats 7 Lives for fish tacos).

In contrast, the braised short rib hard shell taco is simply $@?!/$ stupid good. The braised rib is so tender and packed with flavour. Excellent toppings as well. This is a top taco in the city for sure.

In summary: A great overall experience and well recommended. I don't care if you classify Barrio as Mexican, Korean or fusion... it's just good.

PS - try and avoid wall seating just in front of the bar, it gets too crowded in this area.

Let's start with the location.  This Mexican-Korean fusion bar & restaurant is located in Korean town.  It is one of Playacabana restaurants or the MAS PLAYAS Group.  However it seems to be influenced by the neighbourhood.  That is why you can see many Mexican-Korean items on the menu like Baja fish taco with kimchi, K-Mex Slaw, etc.  Barrio Coreano can be a good choice for people who wanna explore a new taste of MEXICAN-KOREAN food.   The restaurant is quite small but I think they can accommodate up to 40 - 50 guests.  If you like RUSTIC DECOR, FUN & FRIENDLY ambiance and don't mind to be very close to other tables, you will like BARRIO COREANO.

Food: 
We ordered quite a lot because we didn't plan well , also misheard when our waitress told us that they ran out of the special beef steak taco.  We though it was the White Fish Taco that was out.  So we ended up ordering two items of fish tacos, the White Fish and Grilled Baja Fish .  
 
 - Fish Taco : The white fish taco was good but I'd prefer the baja fish which came with kimchi. Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.  We got three. They were very tasty.
 - K-MEX SLAW ($12):  We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese \"Queso Fresco\", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.  It was an interesting dish.  However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.
 - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.  My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .  The Guacamole was good though. 
 - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.  He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.  The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of  spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs. 
 - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .  I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!  It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.  The red one is the spiciest!!! 

Drinks: 
It's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer \"Modelo Especial ($7)\" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.  However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.  I became a spicy-drink lover .  

Barrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.  They are $12-$14.  We didn't get any cocktails this time.  We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).  The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.  It was dry and low to medium bitter.  

Dessert:
 - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.  Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with  if you like SWEET.  

Service:
 - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.  We didn't do it though.  Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .  Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.  They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends. 

Price:  In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.  However, taco prices are average.  I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.  A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~ 

OVERALL is good"}
{"text":"Word of advice: definitely make a reservation if you want to eat here. At 7:30 on a Thursday, my group got the last two seats in the place that weren't reserved! The place was really packed so the seats were pretty awkwardly placed in front of a giant sign/shelf and we were so close to the people next to us that we were brushing against each other most of the meal. 

Great place though, the decor was really cool and the staff were nice. Food was great too; we ordered the ceviche, shrimp bulgogi tacos and carnitas tacos to share. The ceviche was super fresh and light. The shrimp tacos were sweet and spicy. They were probably the best part of the meal. The carnitas tacos were a little bland I found but overall the food was a 4.5/5. Usually I am not a huge fan of hard taco shells but these were crisp and pretty light, not overly hard. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here Thursday afternoon for a date with my two girlfriends. A quick walk from Christie Station and I arrived at this location of Playa Cabana. They had only given us two seating times for reservations but it was pretty quiet at 530 so I'd take my chance and do a walk in if you could get in for that time. 

The place was playing some really good old school reggae that of course speaks to the Scarborough in me. Sat at the bar waiting for our other friend and had a drink. I had the Cuban julep which was very refreshing but i feel that there was too much shaved ice for my liking. We had ordered a pitcher of sangria but it was way too sweet and I did not really care for it. There are different oysters at the bar which for me wasn't so appealing since it was too fishy of a smell and i don't eat seafood.

We chose a seat by the window for ample people watching. We had a great waiter who was super friendly. He was very informative and patient with us for taking forever to order. We ordered guac to start which was amazing. Didn't taste salty at all! I had the braised beef short rib tacos and the chicken ones as well. The chicken tacos were with a Korean twist and battered. It was bursting with flavor. The braised beef went well with the hard shells. The meat was so soft it melted in my mouth. It was amazingly delicious. To end we had the tres leches cake which was not overly sweet and huge enough to share with three girls. It was the perfect end. 

It is reasonably priced i think. We each put in 50 that covered tax and tip. I would like to try the other locations!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I made a point of checking this place out for dinner a few days ago. Overall the experience was pretty very underwhelming.

The chalk board menus were pretty much impossible to read from where we were sitting, and without us even mentioning it our waiter awkwardly pointed out that we'd have to make due because he didn't have menus to give us. The waiter was friendly and nice but kind of awkward to talk to, and I felt bad that he had to basically read us the entire menu because we couldn't see it.

As for the food, it was largely a disappointment. The chips and guacamole were nice and fresh and tasty. We each got different tacos (pork, chicken, beef, and cheese) and none of them really impressed. I had the pork and cheese and both were so stacked with garnish and stuff that it was impossible to eat at first. My cheese taco also dripped out about a table spoon of liquid when I first picked it up, but the fancy Mexican cheese that's in it is pretty dope. My girlfriend's chicken was okay, but the beef was so soggy it fell apart after the first bite. She ended up just sending it back after an aborted second bite. She couldn't even use a knife and fork because there was paper under the taco that was so soggy it just ripped and mixed with the food.

I thought the prices were pretty high for what you get, both for food and drinks. 5 dollars per taco is only worth it of they're good and don't drip a bunch of liquid or fall apart. My girlfriend said her margarita was amazing, but I was pretty bummed about my 6 dollar bottle of Dos X or whatever it was. Dos X is fine, but that was their cheapest option and it was in a bottle.  I would have gotten a pint but I couldn't see that section of the drinks menu so I didn't even realize they had pints until we were walking out.

I don't know who's running this place but they need to pull their head out of their ass. Also, these people who attended a \"media party\" should actually sit down and try the place before giving it 5 stars. I feel like they did NOT eat at the same restaurant I did."}
{"text":"I've never been to any of the Playa Cabana restaurants but decided to check Barrio Coreano out for my birthday due to its proximity and accessibility, being right on the Bloor line and a few minutes walk from either Christie or Bathurst station. As soon as I entered the restaurant I knew I'd made the right choice. This place has this funky, eclectic Mexican vibe going on with a loud, energetic ambience and it's perfect for a larger group. The space itself has so many details big and small that catch your eye throughout the night. The one thing I noticed while being seated is the space is much bigger than it looks on the outside so it doesn't ever feel cramped. It's a perfect venue for groups of all sizes.  

After most of my group arrived we placed our drink orders. They have an excellent selection of cocktails to choose from and our server also suggested a few of her favs. If you're looking for a few drink suggestions try the Mezcal Mule - citrusy gin cocktail, or No Love - a watermelon gin cocktail. Clearly, I'm a gin girl ;)  The drinks arrived pretty quickly considering how busy the place was getting so that's always a good sign and always appreciated by the party. 

Next we were on to the food at which point I just wanted to order everything on the menu. The great thing about a large group is you can actually do that! A few of my fav dishes were the octopus tacos - delicate and spicy, the Kalbi beef ribs - tangy marinade and perfect for sharing, and the charcoal smoked wings - smoky and served with blue cheese. YUM!! After the first round of food and drinks I was in HEAVEN! It's exactly how I pictured spending my birthday, with my friends eating delicious food. 

Towards the end of the meal our server brought out the churros poutine, served in a cup of sugary goodness, with candles in it which was very sweet. Definitely try the churros! They come in this marshmallow caramel sauce that tastes divine. 

I do want to mention there were a couple small issues regarding our service but I want to chalk it up to the fact that the restaurant was really busy. We had a couple orders placed incorrectly, and at the end of the night there was difficulty in getting our bill printed. I assume there was a problem with the system itself and our server was very apologetic about it. 

On the whole, the entire experience was fantastic and the team at Barrio Coreano really made my birthday extra special. Everyone really enjoyed the venue, the food and the drinks. I would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I said I wouldn't come back. I did. And I was pleasantly surprised!

4.5.

They now have menus!!!!! HOORAY! As I mentioned in my earlier review, not having a menu is just lazy. I don't find it 'cute' or 'modern' or think that it saves paper (I'm all for reducing and recycling, but I don't think that's really the reason that any of these places forgot the end thing).

The menu is clear and concise. Appreciated not having to strain my neck and eyes to read some server's messy handwriting!!

We had the Baja Fish Tacos and the Short Rib Tacos. Both were amazing. Properly seasoned, lots of fillings and absolutely delicious. Loved the kimchee on the Fish tacos and I love the Playa Cabana recipe for the short rib meat. It's so rich, spicy and gets a big thumbs up!

Chips and guac were a winner again.

When one of the servers cleared our plates we told him how great everything was. He mentioned he loved both those tacos. I asked him what his favourite was and he said Oaxaca Cheese! This was the same taco that was recommended to me before and I found so confusing. The menu clearly says that's crispy and fried. The last time I had it, it was little birdy bit sized cubes of cheese that were just kind of slimy. Don't know what's up with this, but I may have to get to the bottom it on my next visit.

Service was great.

I will be back!!"}
{"text":"A nice change in bloor west that stands out from your typical Korean restaurants.  Really neat grungy decor inside, similar to other playa cabanas... but a warning if you're dining in winter - it is freezing inside... do ask for a table in the back!

You order off the wall menu, which depending where you sit can be hard but fun.  We shared a number of appetizers.  Standouts for me were the salmon ceviche and the calamari.  The ceviche almost has a sweet taste to it.  The guacamole was also very good and you get an unlimited supply of chips.  I passed on the entrees and went with a few tacos - go for the kampungki chicken and yuzu tuna.  I had the spicy carnita and it was entirely too spicy for me to taste anything.  Otherwise, the tacos are on par with general electric and la carnita.

We also had a few of the cocktails.  The name escapes me but the one with ginger beer was delicious. There was a sour one as well (kimchi sour maybe?) that tasted like I was drinking lime juice.

I'd say the korean influence is lacking a bit, aside from a spin on korean ribs and adding kimchi to a few things.  Still, there is a bit of an asian touch to most dishes, which is an interesting fusion with Mexican food."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype about this place and I was hosting out of town friends so I thought this would be the perfect time to try it out. 
Here are my observations:
Atmosphere- spot on. The place is exciting, eclectic, trendy and inviting. It also has a Mexican arcade feel; pretty cool!
Service- everyone from the host/manager to server were kind and knowledgable. One huuuuge downer was the overly loud music. We literally could not hear a word each other was saying; quite a mood killer actually. 
Menu-don't look for a paper menu, everything is written on the big black board wall. It isn't a large menu but everything sounds pretty interesting. There were three of us so we opted for three starters and three tacos. Starters were grilled calamari, king crab ceviche and slaw and tacos were duck mole and baja fish.
Food- everything was tasty. Nothing earth shattering or worth raving over. Well, that's a lie; the duck mole was pretty good. The ceviche and slaw weren't nearly pungent enough for me. 
Drinks- unique cocktail menu, HUGE tequila menu and a couple of beers on tap. Cocktails were way overpriced for me. 
Overall- depending on how hungry you are, your company and what kind of dining experience you're looking for, this place could be worth checking out. 
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Brilliant. Food unreal, vibe good, cocktails great, if a bit Mexican and not to my taste."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is really fun. They have diverse seating options that offer unique dining experiences. You can be at the bar, the front section for street watching, the middle section for intimate conversations and near the back for a kitchen view. 

They have a list of oysters from various regions, depending on the day. I don't have a sophisticated palate when it comes to oysters, but I thought the random selection I made (NS region) were delicious. We had the oysters, the guacamole dip with glutton free chips that were delicious enough to eat plain. We also had the soft shell Baja fish tacos that were spicy and delicious, but the chicken tacos were pretty disappointing and weirdly chewy - I'd go back for the Baja fish ones though!

They also had what looked to be a fun cocktail mix, but I was in a beer mood.  Unfortunately the keg was empty and only going to be replaced in a few days. My server recommended a similar bottled beer to try in lieu, but it tasted nothing like the lugtred draft I wanted. I'm not sure what he was thinking...

This place could have been a 4, but the keg fiasco, lousy substitute recommendation, and crummy chicken tacos took it down a star."}
{"text":"My new fave resto in the city. Hands down the best fish tacos, followed closely by whatever they have in the BBQ. 

The ceviche is tasty but a tad pricey for what you get. The slaw salad is also yummy. Didn't try the cheese taco's, but they looked really hearty and interesting. 

Amazing tres leche cake for desert. Really fun vibe."}
{"text":"We ate at 10pm so absolutely no wait. We ordered the baja, the cheese one (?), the shrimp and the carnita tacos. Oh man, all so tasty. The baja was the stand out. So many amazing flavours mixing. I could have eaten 100 tacos there. The atmosphere is fun but pretty loud so don't try to have an intimate conversation over dinner here."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty tacos! The tacos were fantastic, I'd say the vegetarian was the weakest one. I'd order the other two again in a heart beat.

Meals come out as they're ready, not sitting under a heat lamp for the rest to be ready. Which works well, you can't eat three tacos at once anyways. 

I'd recommend going early, or making a reservation, place was packed."}
{"text":"We originally didn't plan on coming here. The restaurant we wanted to go to was unable to serve us do to the long wait and closing hours. So, we came across this beautiful spot. 

Service was great. 

The tacos we ordered were short rib and shrimp. They both were hard shell tacos, but were clearly well constructed tacos so I was still able to eat like a lady.

The guacamole was fresh and simply delicious.

We ordered old fashions and margaritas as well."}
{"text":"Sadly third time back wasn't a charm. The carnita tacos were grossly greasy, not tasty and fresh like before. It seemed like the staff were overly busy (the resto is obviously doing well) and so maybe the meat was a bit dried out and they poured extra oil over top to remedy the situation? Anyway, at least the guac and chips are still as fresh as ever and pretty stellar, but this is turning out to be the best part of the Barrio Coreano experience."}
{"text":"I am always looking for the next greatest Mexican restaurant and I think I found my new favourite. As Playa Cabana's newest baby, Barrio Coreano definitely had a group of followers waiting to check it out, I being one of them! To be honest, Playa Cabana is not my favourite place for tacos in the city but they are very authentic Mexican and have the best quac. I was weary about the Korean-Mexican fusion but he minute I walked in I realized it really was Mexican with Korean flavour.

We got there at 7:30 on a Saturday and we were told that they don't reserve seats for walk-ins. I was very surprised, that is not normal practice in Toronto and even Playa Cabana often saves place for walk-ins. We waited half an hour at the door and finally squeezed our way into the bar. We grabbed a drink and was told that they had a table for us that would be ready in about another half-hour. I'll give them credit, for a restaurant that doesn't keep tables for walk-ins, they ensure that you aren't forgotten and do their best to accommodate you.

Food: SUPER gluten-free friendly (corn tortillas). Every dessert is gluten free (flourless chocolate cake, coconut flour cake, flan, and green tea ice cream).

Dave's Margarita: Strong and delicious! I nursed one all night long...

Hostesses: Very friendly and helpful. They knew we really wanted to sit at a table for dinner and kept an eye out on the tables to find us a spot. 

Atmosphere: Very similar to Playa Cabana's Cantina location - dark with the great neon signs; hipster but not overwhelmingly so that I (jeans and a cardigan) felt comfortable. Great bartenders, waiters and other patrons :)

Food....OH WOW. I was so impressed because as I mentioned, I am not a huge fan of Playa Cabana's tacos.

1) Grilled calamari: So good. Burnt arbol kimchi made this the best grilled calamari I've ever had! 
*Good portion to share.

2) Duck taco: FAK. Seriously this was amazing. I was a little nervous because I rarely eat duck and often the sauce that comes with it is heavy but this was delicious. The meat was tender and fresh. The sauce was full of flavour and light. They bring you this with 2 tacos - really helps to make sure you don't lose any of that duck!

3) Baha fish taco (grilled): I really appreciate that they are willing to do this taco grilled because most other tacqerias won't accommodate dietary restrictions and I never get to eat everyone's favourite taco!!! The taco was amazing. It was perfectly flavoured and piled to the max! My only complaint is that it was super soaked through the taco which fell apart immediately. I am all over messy food, and understand it's the taco way but it seemed to be at a different level.  I am not sure if they was because it was grilled, or if all of them are like that - but I would recommend asking for 2 tacos just so that one can hold it together. 

4) Coconut cake: WOW. Gluten free, made of coconut flour. It was small, dense and delicious!! Topped with whipped cream and I think there was a bit of ice cream too because it was cold. 
*Good portion to share.

I think they are continuing to figure out the menu. The beef tacos that people have pictures of are no longer on the menu. 

All in all I would highly suggest trying it...with a reservation!"}
{"text":"I was kind of unsure of how good the food would be. But WOW! That fusion was amazing. Those chihuahua tacos were the best and the drinks were such a hit with my friends and I. I will definitely be here soon again."}
{"text":"This place is unreal!! I went here with my wife and 2 friends last Tuesday night, at about 10.20pm and they were about to close the kitchen. Our server named Cort approached the table and explained that the menu was on the chalkboard on the wall and that he would come back soon to tell us about it in detail while set us up with cutlery.

The drinks specials were explained and 3 of us put our hands up instantly when he explained the smoked whiskey sour with charred pig skin. Mind blow. That drink was superb. My wife had a margarita which wasn't sweetened enough.

They have a selection of tacos, appetizers and mains. My friend and I shared the 32oz steak with pineapple kimchi and the girls had tacos. We all had guacamole which was nice, lobster something which was great and crab ceviche which was just ok and shared it all. The flourless chocolate cake was a treat, it came with a matcha green tea ice cream that complimented it perfectly.

Cort then came over with 2 sipping tequilas and explained them to the table. His service was honestly one of the highlights of this place, when he wasn't at the table he was singing along to the music while cleaning up, which added to the great vibe of this place. 

So, four of us ate until we were full. Had a cocktail each and my friends had a nice Tequila each-the bill was $210 we left $50 for Cort because he was great and this is now one of my fave places in the city. 

Big up to the guys in the kitchen for the awesome food, thank you Cort for the great service and a big shout to Nath behind the bar for the drinks. Top experience 9.5/10"}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere and decor here. Very homey, yet eclectic with neat lighting. The food is also fantastic.

The ceviche was fresh and delicious, I love those super crispy tortilla chips! The octopus tacos are amazing.. the octopus pieces are perfectly cooked: tender and not even a little bit chewy. And the flavour is incredible. Possibly the best octopus I've ever had. The grilled baja fish tacos were good, but a bit of a let down after the other dishes. 

They have a nice variety of tequilas, but wish they had a menu, instead of going to the bar and having to get the server to explain them all to us. Also, there's no easy way to say \"how much per shot? Ooh... do you have anything... cheaper?\" I found the drinks kind of pricey, but I don't know cheap from good tequila.

The service was absolutely fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing, friendly, welcoming and knowledgable. A great place all around."}
{"text":"Love their tacos and the gochujang ribs are phenomenal - if you can get an early spot at the bar, the servers and bar tenders are chatty.  Only drawback is the place isnt air conditioned and is SWELTERING in the summer .  Got lettuce instead of taco shells and they used romaine which was pretty disappointing (also wilted due to the extreme heat in the summer )"}
{"text":"Oh, Shiz, Not the FTR

Damn- 

I agree with Robbie's FTR
2 stars is a \"meh, I've had better\"- I've DEFINITELY had better.  and cheaper.  they call that place Grand Electric.

This place is a new taco place that does things well at a higher price point, and when compared to other taco places (like ge or the taqueria just a few doors down)- Barrio Coreano does things averagely at a higher pricepoint.  So fail.

We tried all the tacos (5$) and the Octopus and Guac starter

The octopus was nice and tender and tasted good but not amazing and definitely not worth the price point.
The Guac was good- but there was nothing Korean about it- and the chips are traditional maize-thick -corn but SOOOO OVERSALTED I had to wipe the chip down on my napkin.
This is definitely a kitchen oversight on quality control- I don't expect this to be a consistent problem.

In order of deliciousness, I would recommend the 
Tuna,- very good but the fish wasn't crispy at all.  The flavours were there though
Octopus,- The texture was nice 
Pork,- nice and tender
Chicken,- good, not crispy 
Beef- Just not good.

they had 2 different types of hot sauce that didn't add much value to any of the dishes.

I should say that there's not much about this place that is Korean... they did such a poor job of infusing creativity into the menu and truly making it a Mexican-Korean fusion.

The drinks seemed fairly pricey for what they were and since this was only their second day- they didn't offer a lot of things that were on their menu (i.e. enchiladas and burrritos)- which I don't like.... don't open if you're not ready- or don't put them on the menu!!!

The service was good. nothing really to complain about there.
It was a short wait for a table for 2 and they text you when your table is ready.
Go and get a cheap pint at Pour Boy and then walk over.
But better yet- just walk over to Grand Electric."}
{"text":"I've been twice. First with my brothers and cousin, and the second time with a guy I was seeing who dumped me as soon as we left this place (yes, you can go ahead and LOL). 
So, my experience of this place is a bit tainted....but, with that said, the food is pretty amazing (except the oysters, but I hate oysters so maybe for people who like them they are good?). The margarita is pretty strong (needed when you're being dumped). The atmosphere is reallly cool. There's such a cool atmosphere and it is *way* too hip for Koreatown. It really does not fit in, but that's what makes it such a gem. The types of people that go there are a really cool mix of ages, styles, and the music is sooo out of place which I always find entertaining - the first time I went they were playing 90s rap and hip hop. 

It's a lot more Mexican heavy than Korean heavy on the food side. The main Korean bit I noticed was the condiments. 
The tacos are teeny, but reallllllly good, and the place is pretty expensive, but so worth checking out.

And, despite it being tainted from my last visit, I'd *still* definitely go again! 

So, that says something!"}
{"text":"We had a really rough experience here. In the end, it hits none of the restaurant trifecta, which I have just invented: experience, food, and price. You gotta have two. This place honestly had none on the night we visited, and I won't likely return. It was honestly the most disappointing meal I've had out in a long time.

Aside from being the second most self-consciously decorated restaurant I've ever been in (see also: Weslodge) there are major issues with the super fun \"order off the chalkboards!\" menu approach. You can't see one from a bunch of different places in the restaurant. So, we - and several other tables - ended up standing in the middle of a crowded, cramped restaurant and yelling back to dining mates over the din, trying to figure out what to order. Please, please get over it and your schtick and get a printer, or early century schoolhouse slates from the American Pickers website or wherever it is trendy restaurants are ordering their decor from, so that people can order from any seat in the restaurant - if only for those handfuls of seats where it's simply not possible to see your menus, you need a better solution.

They seem to be aware of the problem, because the excruciatingly long and complete recitation of the menu from your server seems to be standard. It almost got to be hilarious. After saying, quite clearly, that we were starving - she began her diatribe - which is not limited to a listing of the menu items. Each individual menu is hyped up with elaborate descriptions and personal opinions (of course, everything is FABULOUS, right?) It is literally impossible to retain 90% of the stuff your server has to say, particularly when you insist on listing every single garnish in every single taco. This is an absolutely critical thing that the owner needs to address right away. It is truly bizarre, and I am, as you see, not the only person to be perplexed (and irritated) by this.

To add insult to injury, our server proceeded to give glowing and elaborate descriptions of dishes that weren't even on the menu, but, had been really good a few weeks ago? And after 7 straight minutes of verbal gastro diarrhoea, she completely failed to assist in ordering a sufficient amount of food. A JUST AMAZING shrimp curry recommended as an entree ended up being two shrimp (seriously) in a pool of thin sauce. So. Bad on experience on several levels.

Guac was fine, chips were the best part of the meal.

The \"INCREDIBLE watermelon ceviche\" arrived first, about a cup of chopped watermelon chunks and some soggy, watery garnish. I understand that a ceviche is a dish that frequently has meat or fish in it. This dish did not. Why did it need to be nearly ten dollars?

Tacos fell badly short, completely inconsistent with the amounts of garnish, far too much water-y stuff leaving us with messy, soggy handfuls of shredded and disintegrated tortilla and warm meat. Proportioned all wrong, with heaps of shredded veg totally obscuring everything else. Octopus taco was inedibly dry. The person who ordered it had a bite and rejected it, the garbage can boyfriend who eats everything had a bit and rejected it, I swooped in to try to finish it off and also found it inedible. When our server came to clear she noticed it was unfinished and did comp it. But honestly: three people could not finish a taco. You have a problem here.

The proportioning of ingredients in a taco is something that Grand Electric does beautifully. More is not more. when you want to taste the primary filling, less, when it comes to garnishes, is often more. And when more really IS more, figure out a solution to make the thing edible by hand - Grand Electric does this by doubling the tortillas.

Shrimp dish was as mentioned before, overpriced and hilariously under portioned. So, food was an issue.

Dinner for four ran us well over $100 with tax and tip (three beers ordered total) and we left starving."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm gonna declare this place my favourite spot for Korean-Mexican fusion food. Is that fair? Whatever, I'm gonna go ahead and do it anyway.

So what makes Barrio Coreano's tacos a true spirit of fusion? Well, let me tell you. The fact that they use Korean style toppings, or that delicious Korean style sauce on a traditional Mexican taco makes it so! Take the Baja Fish Taco, for example. Delicious, crispy, and meaty...topped with a-kick-of-heat cabbages. Or the Chicken kanpunggi tacos, which are decorated with big, meaty pieces of Korean style chicken. Ugh, I'm having another serious craving for the tacos at this place. Someone take me there again. PLEASE."}
{"text":"We went here to brave this unique fusion restaurant and we were blown away! The decor is fun and trendy. Friendly hostess and wait staff. 

We tried their oysters as an appetizer and they were delicious, served with freshly grated horseradish. 

We ordered the chicken kampungki tacos and the pulpo al carbon (grilled Moroccan octopus) tacos. They were outstanding! I loved having the option to serve on lettuce if you want to lighten the meal. The corn flour tortillas were very authentic and tasty though. 

We also ordered sides of the Apple Pear kimchi (made in house). That was hands down THE BEST kimchi! I loved the texture of the dish when prepared fresh and chopped differently than traditional kimchi. 

The service was friendly and fast. We told them we only had an hour and we ate and paid within 50min. 

This restaurant is a must-try for any foodie or fan of Mexican And/or Korean! We will be back."}
{"text":"Barrio Coreano is located at the north west corner of Bloor W and Euclid in Koreatown between Christie and Bathurst along the Bloor/Danforth line 1.

This place is that typical small footprint one in Toronto becomes all too familiar with.  Tacos are generally sold as singles or 3's and the prices are displayed on the menu as such like 6/16 along those lines (6 for a single and 16 for a triple).  We had a 730 reservation but really it was sort of a crawl and while we had full intention on eating we didn't end of staying because it was way to stifling inside.  

Sadly the front doesn't open up and the AC wasn't on and it was far too uncomfortable to spend any sort of time inside so we had our one drink and moved along.  It does however look like a decent place to have some sit down Mexican along with a choice of drinks to go along with dinner."}
{"text":"As s Mexican I enjoy the different variations and experiments with our food. The decor is very unique and it represents Mexico in a good way. Expensive for the portions being served. Definitely would go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place was OK.

The service was okay... I don't know if my server was having a bad day or because it was nearing the end of the night but she did not seem friendly at all... She never even smiled once... She asked if it was our first time there and we had answered yes and she just told us that all the menus are on the wall. Wasn't much of a help.

The lobster appetizer is a must have! The kalbi taco is a big disappointment. The meat was very dry. Considering this place is a Korean fusion, I expected the kalbi to be good. The other tacos (fish, chicken and chorizo) were not bad but not amazing. I tried the sangria which is made with soju and it wasn't good... I had to let my friend finish it for me.

Would I come back to this joint? Probably not."}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican-Korean fusion. You might wonder what this could taste like, but take it from me, these two tastes belong together.

The old metal and neon decor gives the place a funky vibe.

I have tried many things off the menu and have yet to go wrong. 

The lobster tostada and lamb short ribs are particularly good. The beef ribs are also good, but I suggest you stick with the lamb.

They place also serves a range of interesting cocktails."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite of the 3 Playa Cabanas I've been to.  Ordered the guac, ceviche, smoked ribs and several tacos.  Everything was delicious but the chicken kampungki was a standout.  Service was extremely friendly and welcoming, a great night out.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! I almost don't want to tell anyone about it because I love it so much. The staff are so super nice, the guac and chips are awesome, cocktails are also very fun (they have lots of options!) I want to try their tacos next. 
In summation: 10/10, such yes, keep up the great work friends!!"}
{"text":"In the middle of korean owned and korean ran family restaurants, is Barrio Coreano. A Mexican/Korean fusion restaurant that gushes casual dining as soon as you walk in and up the stairs. The playful, energetic atmosphere is accentuated by the neon signs, vibrant music, and combination of dim lit and bright seating spaces. I felt like I was walking into an alley party, decked with brick walls on either side and complete with the long/narrow overall layout of the restaurant.

The long layout makes for seating to be a bit crammed. My table was separated by a two inch gap between neighboring tables and I felt a consistent breeze from the waiters/waitresses walking by closely in the tight quarters. I wasn't bothered though. I enjoyed the intimate environment, offset by the high energy kitchen which was perfectly viewable from the back and the lively conversations happening from the tables around us. 

The menus are on chalkboards hung on the side walls. Items were divided in 4 categories (apps, entrees, tacos, desserts) but the server comes around and literally explains the menu to you in full. A bit more in-depth than necessary but much better than a lack of service in comparison.

Apps range from 7-$14, entrees $20-$36, tacos $5 and desserts $6-$9. All on the pricier side of casual food which is probably the only thing I disliked about Barrio. 

I ordered the scallops with jicama and watermelon salad app (good, but not interesting enough and not quite worth $14). The beef short ribs, which were extremely tender, tossed in a spicy and sweet Korean sauce. Octopus taco (very tender but not flavorful), Kapungki Chicken taco (one of the best dishes I had here) and Chihuahua cheese with tofu pico taco (Fried cheese with the trimmings, don't let the tofu throw you off it's minor).

The prices are on the higher side for what it is, portions are a bit small which isn't justified by what you pay while the flavors you experience aren't out of this world or super exclusive either. Overall I had a fun time at Barrio Coreano. The atmosphere is unique and lively, great for a casual date. The food is done well and tasty, the service is extra attentive and welcoming, and the concept is well executed throughout."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon. I am a mexican national and their tacos were surprisingly impressive, from the cheese to the sauce to the waitress and her awesome service :)."}
{"text":"Pretty close to the best Mexican we've had so far in Toronto. Love the fusion with Korean cuisine, the food was spicy but still very tasty. We started with the fried chicken appy, which was absolutely delish. I then had the short rib sandwich + mushroom soup combo, which was really good. The soup was a clear broth with a variety of mushrooms - not your typical mushroom soup, but passable...probably wouldn't order it again though as I was hoping for a thicker more comfort-food type soup, if you know what I mean. Sandwich was the hit of the combo - large portion and surprisingly great combo of meat + cheese + kimchi. My bf ordered tacos (chicken, octopus, beef), of which the chicken was the best, but all were really good. The only negative thing about this place would be that it is pricey for what you get, but we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm back! 

Yes, my triumphant return to Yelp. I have an 8 month old and a 3 year old now, so I doubt I will ever achieve the requisite reviewer success to ever be an Elite again (sigh, the good ole days) but every time hell freezes over and I am permitted to leave my home to enjoy a meal that is both a) warm and b) doesn't involve YouTube videos of The Busy Beavers Club playing in the background, I promise to review. I promise, ya'll. 

My Husband and I had a date night and, while we were both definitely going to be hangry by 7 p.m., I wanted to go to a much-talked about place we hadn't yet been. I wanted to try something new, to be exciting, and to enjoy it very much. The problem with that is that I get so goddamn hungry that I'm always inherently scared to try a new place because I worry that I won't like it and I'll leave hungry and bla bla bla. 

Anyway, we hit up Barrio Coreano and this is how making the reservation went: I went online to book at Playa Cabana and they had something free for two people on a Friday night at like, 10:15 p.m. Like, I would be so asleep I'd be dead by then. So then I tried the other two Playa Cabana iterations, same deal. So Barrio Coreano, though my least favourite option, it was! They had a 7 p.m. available for 2. 

We arrived a couple of minutes late because time is never on our side any more. We walked in and were totally in love with the vibe and the decor right away. We were seated right at the back and directly next to the dedicated guacamole lady (is there a real term for this? there must be, right?) and the whole time I was like \"Girlfriend, the second you leave to procure more guacamole ingredients, I am going bobbing for apples in that friggin' giant mortar-bowl.\" Sadly she never left her post. 

We ordered the guac and the salsa- both so, so delicious. We also ordered 4 tacos- the chihuahua (a cheese-based taco), the beef taco, the chorizo taco and the chicken mole taco. Everything was so good I wanted to burst into tears and ask if they had a cot in the back, preferably near the guacamole lady, where I could just camp out for the rest of the night. 

The best part of our visit was our server. I am an asshole who is sleep deprived, so her name completely escapes me, but she was so attentive and fantastic and patient. She didn't get attitude-y when we didn't order alcoholic beverages (we just don't drink, because we are boring) and she was really and truly lovely. 

In 18 years when our children move out, we will definitely be back! I kid, I kid. Maybe we'll take the kids for lunch one day. 

One day...."}
{"text":"I loved this place and it's definitely my favourite in between the 3 Playa Cabanas I've been.

We went there on Saturday around 3. The place had a couple of tables and the chill out-cool-relaxing vibe made us pick up the bar to enjoy some appetizers. We couldn't pick better because the bartender was really into her job. She advised us to start with an amazing drink which name is: \"hable con ella\" (talk to her), and which main ingredient is the new fashionable Mexican alcohol: don mezcal. The drink was really refreshing and original, it also contained grapefruit and rose water, a must try!!!

I got excited when I saw oysters in the menu, but the excitement became an uhhhh when the cute bartender informed us that they just get in there at 5 pm.

I loved the decoration, but the food was the one that took my palate back to my roots. We ordered shrimp tacos, octopus tacos and squid. 

The octopus tacos were succulent, spicy, they made me sweat, cry a lil, feel my cheeks again, and I couldn't stop making affirmative movements with my head while chewing them... O la la!!!

The grilled calamari was al dente and with the perfect seasoning. It came with a bed of kimchi that made a perfect fusion of flavors.

The shrimp tacos came with asadero cheese and were marinated with a la diabla sauce. They formed a perfect paste of flavorful, sinful pleasure...This tacos can totally compete with those at seven lives tacos...

We didn't have room for the other menu's favorite: the short rib tacos, but that is just another excuse to go back. Ok no excuse is necessary if you want to enjoy.

On our 2nd visit we asked for oysters, which we enjoyed a lot because they were meaty and fresh; the waitress gave us a good recommendation of her favorite ones and she scored!!

We asked for a not remarkable Guacamole, I mean not a Korean fusion or authentic flavor in it at all. 

The green chorizo \"hard shell tacos\" lacked a lot; were mostly lettuce, cream and cheese. My husband who hasn't  tried the green chorizo still wonders how it tastes...

The carnitas tacos were ok.

I would stick with the seafood options in this place, but still I will give them another check."}
{"text":"This place looks really inviting, but it's hard to get a table! 

They don't start clearing up a bit till around 9:30pm on a Friday. Not trying to be your mother, but MAKE a reservation and make sure you wash your hands before you eat here.

The beef ribs were really nice. The beef ribs were really flavourful and chewy enough that you can still eat it nicely! 

Knowing that this place was opened up by the same people from Playa Cabana, I'm pretty disappointed with the ceviche. The ceviche I've had at Playa Cabana was mind blowing - we were raving it up so much that we even shared a bite of it with the table next to us once. 

On the other hand, come hungry because the tacos are about $6-7 each and $16-18 for three. The fried Baja was the bomb.com. It's a large piece of fish, so cut it up a bit before you go to town on it. 

The octopus taco was great too. It had a nice spicy kick to it, but compared to the Baja, there was definitely no competition. 

The drinks were okay. Of course they have the bottle/cans, nothing on tap. I had a cocktail that was just okay. It was so mediocre that I forgot the name of it. It had pineapple juice, repasado and jalapenos, apparently - but no actual jalapenos came with the drink. I like a dressed up cocktail if I'm going to pay more than $10 for one - especially from a place like this. Even a rye and ginger comes with a lime, am I right? 

Will definitely come back and see what more can come out of this place!"}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing food. Best Mexican joint in the city.  Have to try the beef sandwich n grilled calamari"}
{"text":"Last night my GF and I popped in for a night cap; it was the second time I was there--both times for a late night drink on the way home.

As mentioned below, this place is hip, eclectic and fun--and one of the only cool bars I can think of between Bathust and Christie.  

Food looked good--would like to try it one day.  Or night.

Service was really great.  It is nice when staff comes by to check in on how you like the cocktails as if they had served you a meal.  

We had the Habla con Ella and the Dead Man's Daiquiri.  Both were very well crafted cocktails.  Prior, on that earlier trip, I had a Negroni.  Maybe that is where the addiction began....  Anyway, yes--great cocktails to be had here for sure.  

I think $12 a drink is about the going rate.

My end of the town, east of the Don, has slowly been figuring things out.  Places like the Wren and Sauce compete and hopefully we'll eventually get places more closely duplicating Playa.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Americans are use to burger and fries... as Mexicans are use to tacos.
Try taking a Spanish mother to this place and they'll not be easy to impress.

The food is served quickly, staff is friendly, and it has a pretty hip look to the place... the prices and a lack of a filler food (ie rice and beans) will leave you with an empty belly and feeling like you over paid.

For the regular hipster who wants to try mild Latin flavors with a Korean twist, this might be the place for you.

However you can not fool a Mexican that they should be paying $6-12 for a taco.

Just to note: I'm giving this place 2/5 stars not because the food is bad but because you can't convince my Mexican friends that they should be paying $6-$12 for a small taco."}
{"text":"I was only able to  make last minute online reservations at Barrio, the other restaurants from the Playa chain were fully booked. So we decided to give this restaurant a shot.

We started off with the guacamole and chips, it tasted fresh but the colour of the guac was very brown....

We ordered the lamb short ribs - the lamb was tender and was not gamey at all.The sauce was sweet and delicious and complimented the lamb very well. I quite enjoyed it.

The Baja Fish tacos were large in portion but it was lacking in flavour - both in the fish and the raw cabbage. 

The Carintas Burrito was simple and tasted like any other burrito you would get at a fast food joint.

I'm a huge fan of the other Playa restaurants but Barrio was not on the same level as the others. The price was in line, the service was great but the food was just so so."}
{"text":"Packed place with a cool vibe, lots of neon like the other playa cabana spots. Started with cocktails, i got the Jalisco Old Fashioned (patron + mescal) - quite good. Went with the wifey and another couple so we ordered a bunch of plates to share. Apps were guac, kmex slaw and chicken wings. All were good but the chicken wings were my favorite. Slow cooked with a Korean style dry run and blue cheese crumble.  I had the chicken, fish and octopus tacos. Again, all were very good but the chicken stole the show. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy.  We only waited for maybe 5 mins to get a table.  Our waiter was really nice.  

The three of us split the guac and chips, fried fish tacos with kimchi and the fried chihuahua cheese tacos.  We were told that the Chihuahua cheese would be spicy and asked if we were ok with that, we said fine.  However, it was actually the kimchi in the fish tacos that were super spicy. (And I can handle my spice.)  We had to ask for more water.  Now preparing ourselves for the Chihuahua cheese tacos, we were pleasantly surprised at the non spice. lol Our waiter said that this isn't usually the case and it should had been reversed.  both meals were tasty.  The kim chi could had used a tad less spice.  And they definitely gave you enough chihuahua cheese in the tacos.  A bit too much as this is a very thick and heavy cheese.  I would also say that some of the tacos had different amounts of sauces.  It would be better if they had equal amounts as the flavours i had were slightly different than what my friends had and we all shared the same tacos.  The tacos were a good size.  There were 3 of us and we each had 2 tacos and shared the guac / chips which was filling for all of us.  It is nice that they gave us a choice to have a lettuce option vs the wraps.

Otherwise, the atmosphere is neat.  Decor is quite busy with unique furnishing.  Food came fast and looked good."}
{"text":"First time we went, we were blown away by the novelty of it all: street vibe, totally wheat free, mexican-korean fusion.... We loved the grilled calamari and our palates were so excited by the chicken taco.

Second time we went, we did so on a week night and were less than enthralled. The grilled calamari was so salty that we sent it back, had it remade and sent it back again. You know when something is so salty it tastes bitter? That was it. The other stuff was good though: chicken and fish tacos. Yummmm.

Suggestions: the restaurant needs to ease up on salt and take pride in the korean flavours more, the chicken tacos needed guac, and water should always be served cold not luke warm cuz that does nothing for a mouth that is spiced up.

Super service. So nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place located in South Korean town blends Mexican with Korean food. The place is hard to miss and when you walk in, it appears you have been transported into another world. The inside looks like as if you were eating in a busy street in Asia with bright neon lights and small tables.

The food is quite good with a variety of tacos including kalbi beef, fried chicken and octopus.  I only had the chicken which was quick good with large portions that could hardly fit the taco. My friends preferred the beef over octopus. I also had the seafood tumbada which is similar to paella but had a variety of seafood that you do not normally see.  The portions were not as huge but allows enough room in your stomach to try other treats.

Next time I plan to return and try to lamb short ribs and kalbi beef."}
{"text":"Me and Matt M. Went to this restaurant based on a recommendation from a friend. It turned out to be a great experience. We had the lobster tostada, Baja fish taco, and lamb short ribs. 

When we arrived there was only 2 tables occupied and the server greeted us and told us to choose a seat anywhere. We ordered our food pretty quickly and 2 beers to go with it.

The lamb was perfectly cooked and not too dry and the sauce that acompanied it was slightly sweet and has a spice to it.

The Baja fish taco was the winner of the three, it had surprisingly a lot of flavor and freshness to it because of the radish and jalapeno peppers on top. 

Exactly the lobster tostada had really big chunks of lobster with a spicy mayo of some sort on a perfectly crispy corn tortilla. 

 the service was great and everyone was friendly. It was relaxing and upbeat and they had great music playing from the 90s.

Over a great experience in the middle of Korea town and I would definitely recommend it for a fellow foodies."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's kind of a hit or miss. I really enjoyed it the first time when I ordered the Baja fish (fried) tacos, braised short rib tacos and some oysters as appetizers. The tacos were really good and the oysters were alright. There was a lot of filling in the tacos, which is awesome, and the toppings solid. They only have 1 beer on tap (Beau's) though and the tables are quite small so you might not have room to fit everything on it, we have to place our water pitcher on a ledge somewhere else.

The second time I came, we ordered the Chicken Kampungki, the grilled octopus and the bulgogi shrimp. This time, the food wasn't as good. The soft tacos were cold and the crispy tacos looked like it was deep fried and drenched in oil, which was very different from the first time I came. The chicken kampungki was super super hard which made it difficult to take a bite and actually chew. Octopus was good. The shrimp one was on the taco drenched in oil I mentioned previously so it was alright. 

Servers are all really nice though so that's a plus! Overall, the food is a hit or miss depending on your cook!"}
{"text":"Had a fair share of Korean tacos and made my own. LA ones, overrated and soggy, without properly respecting the Mexican flavors. This place, pretty well thought out. Different shell choices for different meats, and they have a diverse selection. Pretty impressed. And chili oil standard as a sauce? Man you had me at hello. Decor is chill."}
{"text":"Just amazing, great food, great oysters but mostly great ambience!!! The staff is incredible!!! I'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Such a good mix of Asian and Latin cuisine. I had the Korean Short ribs and Chicken Kampunki  taco. Very savory and the meat just fell off the bone. The taco was different but different in a great way. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple friends who had already been before, and overall it was a great experience! Even though it was very busy the staff was still super welcoming and accommodating. We sat at the bar (there weren't any tables available). Our server was Deejay and he was amazing ! Making sure we had everything we needed at all times. I had the fish tacos, also a first for me, and they were pretty good. I am a very picky eater and the only complaint is they were slightly spicy (to me, but to a spice fanatic they would be nothing)! We split some churros for dessert, which were also quite tasty. After our meal I didn't feel rushed to get out at all and took our time, being thanked by the staff again! Defiantly recommended !"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a group of about 10-12 for a coworkers birthday but over the next hour grew to a number more like 15/16 and while this place is small they were great about accommodating us. Our server was attentive and helpful and wanted us to have the best experience possible. When a steak came out slightly well done he made no qualms about whisking it away and telling them to throw on a new one.. If you haven't been here their steak is 32 oz T-bone and the most expensive thing on the menu but he told us it was important that we liked the food and had a good experience and if it was overdone he'd have them redo it. We ordered 3 of them for the table and the other two were done well and I'd say the steak had to be one of the best tasting things we tried. Alot of spicy options here but a good variety of meat/seafood and vegetarian. A good place to go for a tapas experience and attentive service. Also well most of us payed the bill in cash the server was great about accommodating some ppl to pay debit or credit all of which was part of the same bill. We mostly shared all the food and got one bill at the end."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not amazing. Other playa cabana locations are better. There was a cockroach on the bar. Staff is nice and service was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, it's just pricy. I tried the shrimp taco and thought they were yummy, but after 2 tacos forcing myself to eat the third cause I got bored of the flavours. 
Really wish they had a mix and match. Not just buy one taco and go from there since single tacos are quite expensive. So mix and match dinner option would have made my meal better. 

Tried the adobo wings, so tasty! And they had a special for smoked ribs. Fantastic! 

So the cons 
-So tiny inside, but that's Toronto real estate for you. But regardless they try and sell this has a cool grungy taco place but with high prices. So it kind of contradicts itself. 
-Very very expensive for tacos. 
-$12 for the smallest Margarita I have ever purchased. I was very disappointed with the size of it. It came in a small tumbler glass I'd drink a cran and vodka from. 
It was worth $6-$8 at the most. $12 is just ridiculous. It was good though, I won't knock them for that

Overall good food, nothing tasted bad. Just cramped, and very expensive for Tacos. 

Also they have a 2 hour limit on reservations. So after 2 hours you're outta there!"}
{"text":"Went out with one of my girlfriends Wednesday night, and came across this place. I am always down for Mexican food, and the idea of Korean-Mexican fusion sounded interesting and fun.

It was packed for a Wednesday night which was not what I had anticipated for a weekday. It is a tight space, so seating is limited. 

The food was excellent! We shared the guac and chips to start, baja and cauliflower tacos, and the grilled calamari (still thinking about it till this day). The staff was very accommodating and friendly. 

Definitely looking forward to revisiting this gem in the summertime."}
{"text":"You walk into this place and it looks like you're eating in the alley-way of some street. Their menus are on the walls. The guy taking your order is very friendly and just seems like a guy you'd want to have a conversation with.

So they sell tacos, and somewhere it's written there is some Korean inspiration or Korean tacos. I wouldn't go that far, maybe some Korean inspiration. Some of their foods have kimchi, maybe some Korean spices and stuff, some Kalbi. But I mean I think it could use a bit more Korean-y stuff.

I had the Chicken Kapungki Taco and the Duck Mole taco. The Chicken Kapungki was bursting with chicken, I had to take a few pieces out and eat them separately to eat this taco. The Duck Mole, it reminded me a lot of Peking Duck. I also noticed they double tortilla'd this taco, possibly cause of the oils the duck produces. They were both decent.

What I also noticed was almost every table started with guac and Salsa de Pico. It was so easy for the guy seating you to say \"start you off with some guac and salsa?\" and for you to say \"sure\" not knowing anything. They were good though, both had heat. But the one tray of chips is not enough to eat both of these.

Like most other taco places, they are priced accordingly at $5-$6/taco, which in my mind is a high price to pay for that teeny tortilla. But I guess it's the going rate? For me, these are really big prices for such a small thing."}
{"text":"I was invited to this restaurant to celebrate someone's birthday. I reached a bit late and sat down with the group. The waiter seemed a bit rude and abrupt. I don't even remember receiving a welcome to the restaurant. Food wise it was alright. The Baja tacos were good but was underwhelmed by the dessert with the churros. When it came time for the bill, I asked for it to be split but was told that we don't split bills for a party of 6 people. The waiter said it was on the menu, which I did not see (all that was written in fine print was about the food being cooked fresh and what dishes containing  gluten). Because of the attitude of the waiter, I and my friends present will not visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like saying Barrio Coreano ^^  It's located in Bloor Korea town amongst the many traditional Korean restaurants. But this aint no typical Korean joint serving the usual Bibimbap or Pork Bone stew. It's a Mexican influenced menu that elevates their food to another level. You can honestly order any random thing and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Lots of Korean elements are integrated in their dishes. Can't really express the taste you just gotta try it for yourself ^^"}
{"text":"Randomly dropped by this place last night and loved it.  The decor is retro and warm and the staff were great.  We tried the short ribs and fish tacos and we were very impressed.  Will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and it has never disappointed. Every single menu item is amazing - my favourites are probably their Kalbi ribs! They also have the Torta Coreana, a sandwich with kalbi ribs and braised short ribs, which looks small at first but it is so filling and delicious. The K-Méx Slaw (coleslaw salad with some cheese and avocado) is so tasty as well! 

My favourite drink here is the Chai Rye, it has some hints of vanilla and orange that is not too strong but very flavourful. 

Service is also always on point. The only thing I am not a fan of is the seating - feels too tight and you almost feel like you're having dinner with the table next to you. But the food/service definitely make up for it. 

Will keep coming here for a long time :)!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the short beef rib tacos and they were fantastic! Service was phenomenal. And please get the calamari - YUM."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink with some friends. We luckily scored a table by the open window which was a small godsend b/c there is no AC or any kind of air ventilation here. (or maybe just that day..not too sure). We were sweating buckets in that hot, humid air.  So much so that we just ordered one drink and had to leave - it was that uncomfortable.

Now that being said - everything else was good - the server was really friendly and made drink recommendations for me when I asked.  And while this place is tiny, I can definitely see it being a fun and chill place to grab a drink.

I didn't order any food b/c I was too uncomfortable sitting there.  It is a small menu but a little pricey.  Maybe one day when it's cooler I'll come back to try some tacos with my beer."}
{"text":"Service and decor was great. Food was pretty disappointing and very expensive. The tortilla were poorly done and I wasn't blown away. Highly overrated."}
{"text":"This city has so many cool places to eat good food and drink good drinks at a reasonable price. Given that factoid, there's no need to do that here. It's a semi-cool, very close tabled, decent serviced, expensive place. Remember that  group from the 90s? They were called the Spice Girls, they had a huge hit. It was called Wannabe."}
{"text":"We were feeling Mexican and scanned all the Mas Playas restaurants - while we were originally planning on going to Playa Cabana, we ended up going to Barrio due to location. The menu looked appetizing, and while there were no available reservations, we thought we would take the chance and see if we could grab a walk-in-seat.

Arriving just before 7, the place was about half empty, but we were told that the reserved guests were slowly piling in. We were offered a seat at the bar, which we had no problems with and could have some munchies and decide if a full dinner would be in effect, or just an appetizer before the next venue.

As an apple pie lover - the apple pie sangria was a no-brainer, and lucky for me, I got the bottle of the barrel which was the most \"flavourful\". I certainly had no complaints about the taste, but the $14 price tag was a tad steep - I guess that is how much we pay for fancy cocktails nowadays. A Michelob Especial was $7, which is about the standard across hipster restaurants in the downtown core.

To share, we got the guac and chips and an order of grilled baha fish tacos (3). The guac came promptly with a basket of chips and a plentiful portion of guacamole. It was creamy and flavourful and overall very tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect out of the tacos because I've had hits and misses before, but I was thoroughly impressed with the portion size and taste of these soft shelled delights. The grilled fish was juicy, topped with avocado, and kimchi, which did not overpower the taste, but rather complement it with each bite. I would order it again in a heart beat.

I ended my night with a Corona Michelada - a Caesar, but with beer instead of liquor  - a lighter touch but still has just as much flavour. Their Caesar mix had a unique taste (in a good way) and the Corona was light, but paired well with the flavours at hand.

The service was adequate as the bar staff had to make drinks, tend to customers, shuck oysters etc.... I was a tad disappointed because the guests next to us got a list of specials, which we were not informed about at all. It was after we ordered that we heard them being told to someone else so I feel like I missed out on something good.

Will try some of the other establishments but wont have any hesitation coming back!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be great, but it's just okay. 
Maybe some of the hiccups will get worked out.

The worst aspects were:
1) the temperature - it was really COLD. The explanation was that the heat wasn't working properly. Oh, really?
2) the totally uncomfortable metal chairs with seats big enough for a child. Some of the diners looked seriously uncomfortable. 

Our server was earnest, overly so. He was present and way chatty and had suggestions like take a picture of the menu chalkboards so that you can consult your phone instead of looking up. HUH?  

The food was pretty great, yes the chips are too salty, some of the portion sizes are off.  But overall, the mains we tried (lobster, squid, etc) were delicious.  The kitchen needs to get the timing better. Two of our mains sat there getting cold as we quickly tried to finish the starters.  All of this on a TINY table.

My spidey sense tells me they'll do well just on the name & location alone. But really, a few fixes could make it a lot better."}
{"text":"I actually stopped into this place on my way home. My company and I had just had dinner but wanted to grab a nightcap - the very unique decor and lighting is what ultimately drew us in. 

Upon arrival, we decided to set ourselves up at the bar since we were just having a quick one and leaving... or so we thought. Our server actually turned out to be so wonderful that we stayed for a few! I wish I could remember her name because I'd love to give her a shout out, but I'll definitely be back soon to visit!!! 

It wasn't a fancy cocktail kind of night. Just some basic tequila sodas, but I still felt the need to leave a review because my company and I were both so impressed with our level of service. 

I will most definitely be back. We both laughed and said that we wish we hadn't ate because the food here looked so delicious!"}
{"text":"I would give Barrio Correano 3.5 stars. I came here with two friends for dinner on a Friday night. I wanted a reservation around 6 or 6:30, but they only had 5:30 available. 

The ambiance and environment is really cool here. It's too bad that the restaurant doesn't have a patio as I'm sure the decor could have been really well done on one. I had the sense that the design was aiming for a rustic, run-down, side-of-the-road Mexican establishment, but with a hip and edgy vibe, and I would say they certain accomplished that feeling. As other reviews have mentioned, there are no paper menus. Their offerings are simply listed on chalkboards on the walls. I did not have an issues with reading the boards as I was sitting right in front of one and the restaurant was not too busy, but I could see how it would be a pain if you are ordering multiple rounds of food or drinks (which is how they recommend ordering) to have to constantly remember what each dish contains. The washrooms are clean, but I only saw a single room for ladies and a single room for men, so I imagine that there can be a line up at times, especially later in the night.

Dishes we ordered:

1) Guacamole and chips - my friends were disappointed that it did not come in a mortar bowl (how it is served at Playa Cabana) because it gave the sense that it was not quite as fresh. Apparently the guac does have a slight kick to it.

2) Fried quaso chihuahua - my friend likes this, but it was also a bit spicy. It is literally a block of fried cheese on a tortilla

3) Kalbi beef taco - we were told that this would be little pieces of charred beef cooked medium-rare. We were all disappointed to see that the meat was definitely more cooked than medium-rare. It was more like medium-well.

4) Baja fish taco - I asked for this to be grilled, not fried, and to have it without the aioli. The waitress was happy to oblige. It was a good dish and I really like the slaw that is served on top, but I thought that the fish was slightly undercooked and I found that the tortilla had gotten a bit soggy (possibly from the fish?) which made it hard to eat. Despite this I was happy to see that they were not stingy on the amount of fish that they provide!

5) Grilled calamari with burnt arbol kimchi - the calamari was delicious, I would definitely recommend ordering it! I did not find that it came with a lot of kimchi, and do not order it thinking that it is like Korean kimchi, because it isn't.

7) Jumbo shrimp taco - this really was a jumbo shrimp which is tempuraed, placed on a tortilla, and loaded with a bunch of toppings. My friend said it was rather spicy, but she really liked it.

Service - I am a bit torn about what to write about this. I had the opposite experience to what other reviews have mentioned. Our server was extremely pleasant and very engaging. She took the time to go through every dish and offering with great detail when we told her that we had not been to the restaurant before. I have a friend who is both vegan and sensitive to gluten (she was not with me on this visit) and so I am always on the look out for places that can cater to both carnivores and people with dietary restrictions. I asked the server about one of their dishes (the portobello fajitas) because it sounded like it could cater to my friend's needs. The waitress said it would fit the bill and she also suggested other dishes that can be adapted to fit my friend's needs. This aspect of service gets five stars! I called earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our reservation from 5:30 to 6 because 5:30 is a bit early for dinner. I was told that this would not be possible because there were other groups coming in at 7, and that the restaurant tends to get busy around then. When we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30, we weren't too hungry so we thought we would just enjoy some drinks and guac with chips while we figured out what to eat. I got the sense that they wanted us to move along and order our food because they didn't want us to take up the table for too long. When we left at 7:20, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was only about 60-70% full. As a result, it was disappointing that we were felt a bit rushed earlier on in the meal. We also did not ask for our bill, it was simply placed on our table when we had finished our plates and we were not given the chance to ask for separate bills (although our sever was happy to enter individual amounts when we paid).

Overall I had a good time at Barrio Correano, but I do not feel any real urgency to rush back. I would go if other people wanted to try it out. It won't be a staple in my restaurant repertoire."}
{"text":"Overall pretty sweet. No complaints about the look of the restaurant. Then fusion with Korean food was well premeditated. 
I enjoyed my funky mojito. 
Only thing was.. My boyfriends chicken taco was so... Hard. I'm talking like tree bark. 
And there was a weird smokey smell, probably the smoked meats special that night."}
{"text":"I heard great things from friends, and was really excited to try it.
That being said, the food was edible, but not very satisfying or exciting.  For two cuisines that have such bold, interesting flavours, the food here felt uninspired.  We had the wings and the ribs, along with guac.  The flavours were muddled, and definitely not worth the prices.

Perhaps I'll come back to try the tacos that everyone raves about, but I won't make the mistake of coming with high expectations."}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.playacabana.ca/barrio/

What we had: bulgogi shrimp tacos, chicken kampungki tacos

Taste: 7/10

I was craving Korean fusion tacos so we decided to give this place a try. The shrimp tacos were yummy, didn't really taste the bulgogi sauce but it had a lot of guacamole. Mmm guac. The shrimps were a little cold by the time we got our tacos, not sure if that was intended. 

The chicken kampungki on the other hand, IMO, are the most nonsensical things you would put in a taco. It's one of those really cool sounding fusion ideas that wasn't fully developed logistically. They were generous with large fried chicken chunks, which is great, just not in a taco. We could not lift the taco shell without chicken chunks falling all over the place. Even when we removed the chunks and ate them separately, eating the taco was awkward because it was difficult the distribute the large chunks of meat throughout the taco. Also the other toppings/sauces weren't really noticeable so it really just tasted like fried chicken wrapped in a soft taco shell.

Value: 4/10

13$ for 3 chicken kampungki tacos, 21$ for 3 shrimp tacos.  We weren't really full after 3 tacos.  It was more of a snack.

**Average cost per diner: $20 after tax and tip 

Service/Convenience: 8/10

The place was easy to locate and fairly accommodating, as we went in at a very busy time and they were fully reserved, but slipped us in since one of the reservations was for an hour later. The decor looks super hipster and the place is really cramped. 

The waitress was very knowledgeable and explained the items on the menu. They brought out both sets of tacos at once so it took a while. As mentioned above, I think the shrimp tacos were sitting out and cooled down by the time we got them. They might've been more tasty hot. 

The waitress looked kind of anxious to get us out of there before the people who reserved the table comes, but fear not, at the rate that we inhale food, we were out of there in half an hour. 

Would go back? Maybe, if I'm really craving fusion tacos again. Though I prefer the tacos at Smash.

Would recommend to friend? Sure, if they like fusion tacos.

Similar places: Han Ba Tang (Korean fusion tacos), Smash (other fusion tacos)

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"This is a review for lunch on December 9th 2017.

My friend and I stopped in here after the lunch rush (around 2pm) and it was pretty much more or less empty with exception to one other table.  We were very strangely seated at the front of the restaurant (right next to the door) -- this was probably to give people outside the impression that there are people eating here.  The downside was that because it started getting cold, I was right next to the gust that came in every time the door opened.

The table itself didn't seem too steady and the seats were too high for my liking (super awkward chairs for short customers, sadly).

We only ordered tacos to share (two of the 3 taco sets).  They were ok, nothing too amazing for fusion Mexican/Korean food, but more expensive than other Mexican places."}
{"text":"A busy little spot bloor west.  It really helps to have a reservation here and after going once I can see why.

Everything I had was flavourful and crave worthy days later.  Honestly, one of the best guacamoles I have ever had. Almost beats my homemade version.  

That night they had marinated ribs on special we had to try. It was heavenly a combination of sweet and spicy. Absolutely tender!

The next thing was the grilled fish tacos which come in threes.  It's not a small piece of fish either my friends. It was crisp, zesty with a wee bit of heat. Again, another crave worthy dish.

I wish I could tell you what I had to drink but what I can say is a friend of mine recommended and I had at least two of those. I would have ordered a third but the server was pretty keen on stating our reservation time had run its course. It put on a damper on our meal so although we have such accolades about our food which I was still munching on, having the bill in front of me was the only bummer."}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night with friends. Great vibe, good cocktails. The pork taco was fantastic, and so was the banana ice cream."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Decor/Ambience: One of the best hipster decorated restaurants that I have ever been too. From the outside, it looks like a hip bar, but when you go in, the dining area expands all the way to the back. There was a large shelf area with lots of cool little things. The music was mainly hip hop, which I liked. 5/5

Service: The service was amazing! We had a very knowledgeable server that was friendly and gave us the low down of everything before we even ask. She told us that each dish is larger than the last on the menu (i.e. items at the bottom are the largest), how many dishes to order for our party size (3 dishes for 2 people), and the most popular dishes on the menu. Some of our dishes took longer to come, but we had a very apologetic server that acknowledged this, which I thought was good. 5/5

Food: The food is designed to be shared like tapas. My friend and I had:

1. Guacamole and Chips $9: The guacamole was kind of bland and tasteless. The chips were crispy and hot when served. 2/5

2. Grilled Calamari $14: This was very good. Very flavourful and soft. It melted in my mouth. The only issue for me was this was a very spicy dish (I am a complete weak sauce when it comes to spicy food) so I only had a couple of bites. It would be good if they noted on the menu that this dish is spicy. 4/5

3. Eel bread appetizer $10- a feature not on the menu: The eel was mixed in mayo with some veggie like thing (maybe carrot) and was placed on small pieces of bread. I couldn't really see what it was because of the dim lighting. This was very salty and not worth it because I couldn't really taste the eel. It was overpowered by the mayo and veggie. I definitely would not order this again. 1/5

4. Bulgogi Shrimp El Diablo Crispy Tacos $21: This was by far my favourite dish, but it was pretty pricey. I don't think the price was worth it, but it tasted amazing. The shrimp was mixed in this amazing red sesame salsa sauce with cheese and it tasted fabulous on the crispy taco (a bigger version of the chips with the guacamole) This is a very oily dish and a bit messy to eat, but was totally worth it because it was delicious! 5/5

5. Churros $9: The churros were a bit hard, but it was in a lovely marshmallow chocolate sauce. I have had better churros elsewhere. 3/5

I ordered a Mexican coke, which was awesome. If you don't know what a Mexican coke is, it's coke made with sugar cane instead of corn syrup so it's \"healthier\". My friend had a Dead Man's Daiquiri and said it was really good and strong!

Cappuccino $4: Save your money. I didn't like my cappuccino at all. It was really bitter and wasn't hot. 

Overall, I would give the food a 3.5/5. I noticed that they do change their menu from time to time so I would definitely go back to try other things. For the two of us, we spent about $110 including tax and tip. This is pretty pricey! However, we did order the most expensive thing on the menu (the shrimp tacos). You can technically spend about $50 here for 2 people and be full if you don't get the most expensive thing on the menu and the extra stuff that we got (coffee/tea/drinks etc). We definitely left stuffed and I had even had take aways."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim saturday night to grab a bite before we went skating. Place was packed, was lucky enough to get seating at the bar near the front. I loved the vibe as soon as I got in. Chill rap/hip hop playing, rugged, blackboard writings on the wall, mismatch of decor, yet bright and inviting. The menu was bursting w a fusion of flavours that it made me want to try everything but just not possible in one sitting. Started w the K Mex slaw - great crunch, great flavours, really refreshing - good portion for 2 to share. Then we got one each of: spicy pulpo taco, baja fish taco, braised short rib, and bulgogi shrimp el diablo. Best one by far was baja fish taco - just enough heat, but still packed w flavour. Bulgogi shrimp was stacked and super saucy, not overly spicy. Spicy pulpo (octapus) was also very good but really spicy - my lips were still tingling even after we left lol. Braise short rib was just 'alright' - milder flavours - nice way to tone down the heat from all the other tacos. Drank tons of water. Bill was $40 btw two of us and we were quite full after sharing everything."}
{"text":"Trendy, hip place in KoreaTown, serving great tasting Mexican/Korean fusion food. Don't knock it until you've tried it!

I went there with friends and co-workers, all from the hospitality/F&B industry, including an executive chef. We were all impressed with the flavours and creativity of the dishes.

The special of the day, smoked ribs, were some of the best we've had! The tacos were so good, we ordered more. It will take more than one trip to sample everything.

Service was great, too! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that I wish the portions were bigger so I could stuff more into my face! The braised beef sandwich was... Transcendent! *Homer drool*"}
{"text":"Frustrating experience! 

An average tasting menu, way overpriced for the neighbourhood. Everything is seasoned with a heavy hand and is overwhelmingly spicy, and not in a good way. What makes this place cringe worth is the customer service. 

I made the mistake of leaving a new pair of designer sunglasses on the table, and of course when i came back for them, they said that \"nothing showed up\". What bothered me was the annoyed attitude. As if to imply that I shouldn't waste my time searching for my lost belongings because I shouldn't expect to see them returned. A restaurant with integrity always returns belongings. I believe it to be a fair expectation of any half classy restaurant."}
{"text":"Part of the Playa Cabana family, you can expect good Mexican food.  This fusion place definitely delivers that great Mexican food with a Korean twist.  We went to the restaurant without a reservation, and were told to wait for 15 minutes on a Friday night unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  We opted for the bar because I was hungry.

Between the two of us, we ordered the torta coreano, bulgogi shrimp taco, braised short rib taco, and the carnitas de maciza taco, and it filled us up.  I would highly recommend the torta, which is grilled kalbi beef and braised short rib in a bun.  It is definitely not your traditional torta, but it was absolutely delicious!  I also really liked the shrimp taco, the sauce tasted like a milder version of fish sauce. 

If you do plan on coming here, I would highly recommend making a reservation, so you won't be crammed like we were at the bar."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican had me raising my eyebrows but we kept an open mind on the interesting cultural fusion. The place screams cool hipster. They have old bowling signs as decor. Like come on, too cool. We came on a late Tuesday evening so had no trouble grabbing seats in the back. Our waitress was very sweet and checked in on us several times even though we were only here to try out their desserts.

The actual menu had oysters, sharing plates, tacos and desserts. Along with the house cocktails, they have beer (it's Korean, they have to have beer) and wine (red, white and sparkling).

- Churros poutine ($9.00) - weirdest name for a dessert I've seen. Churros and poutine? Like what? I guess the churros resembles the fries while the caramel sauce mimics the poutine gravy. Luckily, it tasted nothing like latter. The churros were hot and crunchy but pretty typical.

- Tres leche ($8.00) - the tres leche was pure heaven. Holy Mexican goodness, this was probably the best tres leche I've had! Incredibly light and moist beyond belief. The top tasted like marscapone tiramisu on crack. GET IT.

I can't say anything about the food but the desserts were a great way to cap our night off. Cool, unique spot to bring a date."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and it was good! 

Ordered the guacamole (which was fresh and came with an ample amount of chips...and was actually a decent portion of guac); the octopus tacos (these were good, octopus was well seasoned and cooked and had guac and other veggies on it, and the baja fish taco (this was delicious grilled fish, perfectly cooked with a delicious kimchi slaw. We came on a wednesday and easily got a table, this place is weirdly lit, and has a nice ambiance. 

Seems like a very hipster place to come. PRO TIP: you can get you tacos with a lettuce shell instead of a tortilla shell."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, and it has been on my must-try list for so long! I was always told the wait was 30 minutes to an hour whenever I visited, and this time I finally managed to avoid the peak time and popped a visit on Thursday afternoon. 
As for appetizer, we got braised beef (kalbi), and for the main we got chicken kanpunggi tacos and octopus tacos. And oh my, were they delicious. I really recommend the octopus tacos. They're spicy but as an octopus/seafood lover, I loved the big soft chunk of marinated octopus leg on the taco along with guacamole. Chicken taco was really good and crispy as well. 
I wasn't sure how big the portion would be, but 3 tacos def filled me up. If you're a guy, maybe with an appetizer. 
The service is superb, the vibe is amazing, and the price is great! I'll have to go back a few more times to be able to say it is one of my fav restaurants in Toronto, and I'll be happy to go back. If you'd like to try a good Korean Mexican fusion for a reasonable price, def give this place a try :)"}
{"text":"At first I was a little bit skeptical because it wasn't really Mexican. The options are quite different than when you go to a Mexican restaurant. But after trying the Baja fish, cheese, chorizo, and beef short rib tacos all skepticism left me. The food is great and so are the drinks. The staff are friendly, and the venue is small and cozy. I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Really disappointing service and food. I have enjoyed the other Playa Cabana restaurants but this one really fell flat. Service was not great either and the food was so MEH. I would eat at Grand Electric over this place ANY DAY."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this place got such high ratings. I am a huge fan of traditional Korean food and Mexican, so was very excited to try this restaurant. The adobo wings were neither of the said flavors, and I didn't realize that there was sauce at the very bottom of the bowl until I only had 2 wings left.. In fact the sauce of the wings tasted more like Filipino adobo than Mexican or Korean. The guac was average and a small portion for the price. In fairness, I didn't try the tacos which is what most people were raving about. Perhaps I'll come again and update my review, but am hesitant as I did not enjoy my first experience here."}
{"text":"Food was Medicore. The ceviche was soupy and overly acidic, ribs were tough-ish (albeit flavourful), and tacos (their mainstay) were just... ok. Fried fish taco was mushy. 

Washrooms were like a night club; dirty. Also, hand dryers didn't work and there were no paper towels.

I've been here before and it was quite good, seems like things have slipped. I rarely complain, but this place needs to focus on the essentials - good food, good service, good environment (I.e. clean washrooms). 

Server was a nice guy, no complaints there!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Barrio Correano on a Friday night without reservations and were seated at the counter trailing the side of the restaurant. Typically not my favourite situation but was happy to see the hooks under the counter for purses and jackets. We started with the guac and chips, and the grilled kalbi beef ribs, both of which were delicious and incredibly flavour packed. Something as simple as corn chips were brought to the next level with a splash of lime and the perfect amount of coarse salt. The kalbi ribs with dressed to perfection and very tender. We split the Baja fish soft taco, fried chihuahua cheese soft taco, carnitas soft taco and the braised short rib hard shell taco. The short rib taco took first place with the Baja fish taco pulling up as a close second. The churro poutine for dessert was not to be missed even though we were stuffed from the meal, we did not regret dipping those cinnamon sugar covered sticks in that dulce de leche bowl of heaven. Service was friendly and well paced. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with a friend and it was pretty enjoyable overall. The margaritas were good and the homemade guacamole and chips were delicious.  The tacos were good, though some were definitely better than others. I tried the Baja Fish, charcuterie and chorizo. Charcuterie wasn't great, though I enjoyed the other two. 

Overall, this isn't my favourite taco place. But it's in my neighbourhood and I'd go back for the ambience, drinks and to try more of the tacos and see if I can find some favourites."}
{"text":"Loved this little fusion place! Would recommend the ceviche, the calamari, the octopus tacos and the chicken wings. Had a great time and service was good. Will be back for sure, certainly one of toronto's top 100."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party last night, and had a really good time. Decore and ambience was rustic and trendy. It was packed on a Friday night. They told us we only had two hours to eat and drink, which is I guess how it goes when you make a reservation for eight, which we really didn't like, but they ended up letting us stay.

The sour margaritas were really tasty, and strong. I had the ceviche which was awesome, and the calamari. I would go back just for the grilled calamari. The portion was huge."}
{"text":"We've visited this restaurant numerous times and it's always delicious! Must try the churros Poutine and the braised short rib crispy taco! 
Definite return spot"}
{"text":"Barrio Coreano is situated in my neighbourhood of Korea Town. 

It's been opened for a little over a year and I have only just ventured here, for my sister's birthday celebration. 

It's a small place. They are always busy and my experience was probably closer to a 3.5 stars. The food is excellent and with a smaller party perhaps it would have been more enjoyable. Yet, having to sit so close together and to have to shimmy out of the way for servers to get by.... kinda problematic for comfort reasons.

This place might be different in the Summer time because people don't have the kind of heavy coats they do in the Winter. But if they have take out, I would gladly opt for that next time, as opposed to their dine-in. 

The chips are amaZing, their guacamole is also pretty tasty, it's great for sharing.
Their baja fish... mmmm and their pulpo (octopus) is tender and full of flavour.
2 tacos is filling for one person, 3 if you are really hungry. 

One can expect to spend somewhere between $13 + for a meal here. Depending on what you get and what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"The food was great!
The drinks were hard!
The venue is cool!

Had an Old Fashioned, a Torta, Fried Chihuahua Cheese taco, and Fried Chicken tacos.

Chicken was good but not great. The amount of food on the taco was way more than say Grand Electric but there wasn't much meat inside. I like lots of crispy but I paid for chicken, not batter. 
The Torta was huge, delicious, and rivalled ones found at LA food trucks.

Don't expect to be able to talk much as it was loud(I know I sound like an old man). 
I saw people ordering the ribs and immediately regret not getting them. 
Worth a visit again."}
{"text":"-Torta Coreana $10: the sandwiches were huge and it will definitely filled you up! They were a bit messy to eat with the meat juices dripping. Although the braised beef was tender and melted in your mouth, I found it to be lacking in salt and it was very rich due to the avocado. Since I couldn't find any pickled pear, I wish there was more kimchi to cut down the heaviness of the sandwiches. 

-Braised Short-rib $5: the braised meat was flavorful and juicy, topped with fresh onions and cabbage. The marinate was sweet and there was a subtle hint of spiciness. To be honest I think there was too much cabbage, and is it just me or I think adding fresh cabbage as topping to any dish is unnecessary? Sure, it provide some crunchy texture, but it add nothing to the dish in terms of flavor, unless you cook it down or toss it in some sauce.

-Bulgogi Shrimp El Diablo $8: My favorite, albeit it is pricier compared to other taco dishes on the menu, but it was worth it. The taco shell was a bit oily and messy to eat, but the shrimp was amazing!! Cooked perfectly, mixed in this an amazing red sesame spicy sauce and I believe there was some guacamole! 

-Chicken Kampungki $5: The crispy chicken pieces were not as spicy as I expected, and while the aoili added a lovely creamy texture, it didn't have that \"spicy\" wasabi taste to it. Overall, I didn't think there was anything special with this dish, it was just like any regular chicken kampungki for me.

-Churros Poutine $9: The churros were \"fries\", the melted marshmallow resembled cheese curds and the caramel sauce was \"gravy\"! I can definitely tell the churros were made fresh as these came out piping hot, however I was disappointed as these churros were a bit hard. Anyhow, while the poutine concept was fun and quirky, this dessert was expensive and it didn't worth the $9 price tag for me.

-Grilled Kalbi Beef Ribs $14: Ok $14 was a bit expensive when you can just go down the street for a cheaper and bigger portion of Kalbi ribs. The ribs were cooked through with the marinade caramelized, deliciously tender and had that traditional Kalbi marinade - sweet and salty. Surprisingly the kimchi wasn't spicy, and it added a fresh and cool touch that helped ease the heat from the salsa for every bite.

-Pulpo Al Carbon $6: Who doesn't love octopus and chipotle!? This was another favorite dish of mine and I was surprised to see a huge piece of octopus, so for $6 it was worth it! The octopus was grilled lightly, not rubbery nor tough, instead it was tender and citrusy. The chipotle added creaminess and worked perfectly with the octopus, just pure deliciousness.

The service was friendly and attentive, and most of the tacos were really good with a few favourites. If you want to avoid the crowd and noises, I advise you to visit the restaurant during lunch as the restaurant is usually packed at night."}
{"text":"We were excited about the prospect of Korean mexican fusion, it adds a new dimension to the taco craze that's prevalent in Toronto at this time. I casually called in on a saturday night and was surprised to learn that they did have a table for 2 without any wait time. Having been opened to the public for less than a week, I could not pass on this opportunity. When we arrived at the location, we did not notice any signs outside except for some cryptic korean which was good enough for us to step inside. The decor inside is grungy and funky typical of all the other playa cabana outposts. You can find anything from rusty chairs to glowing neon signs that add a unique appeal to the ambience. The place is loud and tables are way too close for any private discussions. Now let's get to the food, shall we?

Cocktails - This place actually offers a limited set of cocktails. There is no printed menu, everything is up on the black board. My wife had the sangria infused with soju (our favorite) and I had a asian pear infused bebida (meh)

Tacos - We tried most of the tacos except for beef since it did not have favorable reviews. Our favorites were the chipotle chicken and spicy carnita. The octopus with wasabi salsa was good but nothing memorable. Our least favorite was the yuzu tuna. The taco filling was oversized compared to the tortilla. It also is messier to eat compared to the tacos at the other playa locations.

Service - We were lucky with the service. Our server had great positive energy and we got our tacos within minutes of sitting down. She apprised us of the sauces and also provided honest recommendations (for instance she clearly stated that one of the desserts had gotten mixed reviews). Everything comes out as it's ready in no specific order. 

Barrio Coreano is definitely the kind of place to hang out with couple of friends on a weekend and very much in line with other playa locations."}
{"text":"I loved the ambience of this fusion resto bar. The tacos I ordered only come 1 per order, but they are big and filled with lots of toppings and were flavourful and juicy. The drinks were delicious, and had a nice presentation. The pretty mixed girl that served us was quite tired (We came 1hr to when they were closing) but she still did her best to serve us and took care of us without us seeking her out for anything. The washrooms were also clean which is a plus for small hole in the wall places like this one. This is not a place for big groups. I would say 4 people max. I enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Last night a pal and I went there to celebrate my birthday a bit belatedly. We decided to take our chances and go at 6:30 with no reservation. We got there and had zero problems getting a table. 

Our waiter was kind and attentive albeit a bit nervous but given that it's a new resto I totally get it. He took the time to talk through the menus on the chalk boards and was super great at making recommendations.

I got this incredible cocktail with blackberries and other amazingness. It was the nightly special but at $13 had I known the price before ordering (and if I were paying the bill myself) I would have skipped it just because $13 is very steep. My companion had a dos equis. 

We ordered the salmon ceviche to start which arrived very quickly, we had to do a bit of juggling because the tables are very very small. Overall it was yummy but had a bit too much liquid and not enough fish. It's a decent enough portion size to split as a starter and comes with fresh (I think house made) tortilla chips. 

They have a good selection of starters, the duck tostada that the people at the table next to us ordered looked incredible. 

Between us we ordered 
2 baha fish tacos
1 korean beef taco
1 octopus taco.


Let's start with the fish taco,  THIS IS THE STUFF DREAMS ARE MADE OF. It was incredible. Definitely one of the best I've ever had. Not too greasy and perfectly topped. 

Next I got the korean beef taco, this is a definitely pass for next time. It was unwieldy and hard to eat plus it was SO spicy that it made it unpleasant to eat. I wound up having to eat it with a fork because it was so messy. 

I don't eat shellfish but my dining companion had a similar complaint about too much being on the taco but he seemed to enjoy the octopus.

We also got a bonus fried chicken taco due to a mix up by our waiter (not complaining though) It is named something else on the menu which is a bit confusing and is apparently kind of general tso inspired in its flavouring, I didn't taste that inspiration at all but It was pretty yummy. Glad we got to try it.

For dessert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. It came in a mason jar and warm with the ice cream topped with some sort of nut. The sweet waiter also put a birthday candle on it because I had mentioned my birthday. This was a super nice gesture. This unfortunately wasn't my favourite thing I had that evening. The cake had a weird taste/texture to it but was still totally edible. I would say skip it and try one of the other cool sounding desserts. 

Overall we had a really lovely dining experience. They take reservations which seemed to pick up at around 7:30 so if you don't have one go early like we did. Word of warning, the tables and chairs are tiny and the chairs are also not the most comfortable . 

Our total bill came to about $65 after tax and before tip and we definitely got our moneys worth. With a few minor tweaks I see this becoming a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Very interesting fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine. I was impressed with everything we tried, and really found that there was a perfect balance between the two cultures. There's a daily special coming out of the smoker, and we were lucky enough to get the pork ribs on our visit. Tender, smoky and meaty. We also opted for the grilled calamari on a bed of kimchi, braised shortrib tacos, fried fish tacos with kimchi slaw, and the carnitas pork tacos with bulgogi spice. We were extremely happy with everything, although some of the spice levels were a little high for a few of the diners. Fresh, flavorful, and fun. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something new."}
{"text":"I came here primarily for drinks but ordered a few plates to share. They have a great selection of tequila and mezcal, which we made sure we indulge in. For apps, we ordered a bunch of tacos and their calamari. The calamari was a good example of Korean/Mexican fusion. We sat at the bar and three bartenders took great care of us, so service was great!"}
{"text":"I had zero expectations. I live in the culinary waste land that is North York. 
Pros: what we ordered was flavourful and rather delicious. Smoked snapper tacos, mushroom and pepper tacos and the KMex salad (though it was a very confused melange of ingredients, tasting neither Mexican nor Korean. I do not drink so no comment there.

Cons: everything was super greasy and the wait staff quickly figured out we would not be ordering booze AND our dining companions had 2 kids in tow. Hence tentative service. It struck me as odd that the server took our order and never asked what the other 2 diners wanted. We ended up sharing our stuff. It's hard to explain but I've never seen a server not at least inquire about all at the table. But then again.....

All in all, the food was more Mexican than Korean and while I liked the vibe it was a touch too loud (music). For the money there are better out there of each cuisine. And I can live without the grease."}
{"text":"I love mexican and korean food so I had high expectations for Barrio Coreano.  Unfortunately I'm leaving a mixed review.  Let's get to it shall we...?
Upon entering we were told it'd be a 20-30 minute wait.  No big deal.  The three of us (celebrating a belated birthday) made ourselves at home at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks.  After 30 minutes a server points to a table who's occupants are leaving, and tells us that it's ours. He'd just need a few moments to clear it up.  Perfect!  We're starving!
Unfortunately another guy server, who was clearly enamoured with the two ladies that JUST walked in, decided to lead them directly to our table and seat them!   
This rubbed me the wrong way...naturally.  But fortunately there was another table opening up right away.  Downside is that this one is located directly in front of the door....and it's winter.   Looks like we're having a cold meal fellas!

We ordered the Nacho Chips and Guac, Chorizo spring rolls, and tried every taco between the three of us.
Nachos were spicy!  Guac was good.  But, the spring rolls were just okay.  I like the idea behind them but they didn't \"wow\" me.  As for the tacos, the Chicken was probably my favorite.  The pork (super spicy!) would be my second choice, and the beef, which I thought was supposed to be their trademark taco didn't really do a thing for me.  My friend received his beef taco first and I asked how it was.  His response was \"It's like second grade beef that was boiled in water and left under a heat lamp for an hour\".  LOL I wouldn't go THAT far as I thought it was flavorful, but of the 3 I tried, it was the weakest.

I really wanted to like this place.  I love the Playa Cabana Cantina location in the junction, and could eat there every day.  But unfortunately the mix-up with our table threw a psychological wrench in our ability to relax and enjoy my meal. 
Given that I live so close I'll probably give it a second shot, but I won't be in a hurry to do so.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Delicious fusion food and wonderful service! The ceviche and tacos were my favorite?. It's a bit loud and crammed in there so I wouldn't recommend it for bigger groups."}
{"text":"Checked out @barriocoreano for the first time last night. Was pleasantly surprised by the tacos - yum! - but disappointed by the service. We started off with a great waitress, but we were moved to make room for a larger party - which we were totally cool with. Except, when we moved, we lost our waitress, and had to flag the manager for service after waiting for a long time just to make a second order. The wait, being neglected and having to flag staff for help killed the experience. 

Other thing to note, it gets loud! So if talking is your focus, it may not be the right place for you. 

And....only one beer on tap...the rest are bottles & cans (I think). The cocktails looked great, though I did not try any."}
{"text":"I can't believe all the good reviews..A lot of stuff ( coleslaw, etc ) in the tacos that made them a mess and the taste is not good. Never coming back.
The service is the only good thing."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here with friends. I dig the atmosphere of the place. When we arrived, we had the whole place to ourselves, but it did eventually get busier. We started with the chips and guacamole (okay) and the grilled calamari which I really enjoyed and felt was the highlight of the meal. For my main, I had the Baja taco which was perfectly cooked and the chorizo verde. The servings are smaller but still reasonably priced. I would very much like to try the other locations."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but you will definitely need a reservation.  This is a Mexican restaurant in Koreatown with a \"zest\" of Korea--this is not Korean fusion.  The Los Arango tequila is awesome! And definitely get the Baja Fish Tacos!"}
{"text":"One of the **BEST** tacos in the city. BASTA! The venue is operated by the same guy who owns Playa Cabana, Playa Cabana Cantina and Playa Cabana Hacienda. Just look at the photos on Yelp and you'll get an idea of how good the food is. It is well worth a trip from any part of Toronto if you're craving some Mexican food. Their tacos are to die for. Good portions, with tender meat/chicken/port at $5/each. I can't wait to go back. BTW: you owe it to yourself to try one of their cocktails to understand what a quality cocktail tastes like."}
{"text":"I loved their food. The crispy shrimp tacos and the baja fish were delicious!! Must visit but don't expect good service. I felt the server responsible for our table was not at all nice and had a stick up his ass. Will definitely go back for the food, just ask for a different server"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend just before 6pm on a Saturday. Just a handful of people in the restaurant. The atmosphere is cool and hipster type with rap music playing the background.  Sat by the stairs and ordered our drinks after a quick look at the menu. Had a spicy caeser which my friend says she always orders and I had a Modelo beer. It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks. Then when we placed an order for 2 tacos, a baja fish and a chihuahua cheese taco. That took another 15 minutes. Granted the restaurant was not full capacity, it took awhile I felt.  However, the tacos were delicious. My friend decides to order another one and after our server finally comes back to our table were we able to place it. Luckily it arrives quickly. This place would get better marks for faster service and I would definitely come back because the food was still delicious."}
{"text":"The ceviche was very nice and a very, very generous portion.  Chips and guac were good too.  The crispy taco Braised Short Rib was very nice.  The Chicken Kampungki soft taco was very tasty, although the soft corn tortilla itself was not great.   

If like me you're on search for the best fish tacos (inspired by the movie \"I love you Man\", I guess), then after this place your search still continues... the Baja tacos are good but not great.  The habanero freshly made sauce on the side is very nice indeed.  

The tequila selection is OK, but the price is very high (typically $14.)   The ambiance is nice and hipster-friendly, but I don't buy the uber-rustic decor.  It just looks like they didn't want to spend money to give this place a good scrub.  

Still, all said I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Uhhh, I really wanted to like this restaurant, being a big fan of Playa Cabana! My husband and I made a reservation here last night for 7:00 pm. We were seated right away at our table. It was pretty empty at this point, but filled up at around 7:30 pm. I like the vibe of the restaurant - it's eclectic and fun. 

I had the drink special of the night, which was a rum-based cocktail with blueberries. It was really tasty, and not overly sweet. As for food, we started with guacamole and chips. The guacamole is a nice portion, but the chips weren't very good. They were cold (when I get them at Playa Cabana, they're always nice and warm) and really greasy. We each got a plate of three tacos to share. My husband got the bulgogi shrimp tacos. These were honestly disgusting, and I rarely say that about a dish. Visually, they weren't attractive. The shrimp weren't large and whole - they were so small and butterflied. The shrimp were really overcooked. It almost looked like red brains on a taco shell. They come with a crispy taco shell, but there was so much sauce that the shell was so mushy. The sauce just straight up didn't work with the cheese. It was really spicy without a lot of flavour. 

I had the chicken kampungki tacos, which were also unimpressive but a bit better than the shrimp tacos. I was expecting whole pieces of fried chicken, but it was more like tons of tiny pieces of deep fried batter without any chicken. The pieces with some chicken were chewy and gross. There was barely any sauce on the chicken, but I enjoyed the flavour profile. 

We will never come back here. I appreciate what they're trying to do here, but the execution was really poor. The flavours didn't mesh well together."}
{"text":"A very trendy and hip looking interior where they restored the old brick walls and decorated with funky neon signs. We were there for an early 630 dinner and it quickly filled up after 7.

For dinner, we ordered the K-mex slaw, grilled calamari, seafood tumba, chicken kanpunki taco and pork bulgubi taco. The food was great and tasted awesome. The slaw was crispy with nice mix of beans, cabbage and carrots which matched the smoky tender calamari. Both tacos were a hit - chicken was crispy with sweet sauce while pork bulgobi was very tasty. The best was the seafood tumba - like a Mexican paella with shrimp and lobster! 

Price-wise, the place was a bit pricey (our dinner came out to 75) but food was worth. We will be definitely returning."}
{"text":"Seriously above expectations love all the Playa restos but this one was something special. Smoked meat items were the group fav highly recommend - great vibe and great energy!"}
{"text":"Place has great food especially the tacos! It's great to grab drinks and tapas definitely will go back again very cool spot"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I kept walking past and meaning to try. When I finally did I was surprised! The place was bigger than I expected and the atmosphere is really rustic bar like.  The menu was simple and there were neat combinations where you wouldn't find elsewhere.  I also liked how they had an oyster bar too!  Will definitely come back when catching up with friends or for simple date nights."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night. Was seated fairly quickly. Very nice and cozy ambiance, pretty hipster. Drinks were pretty pricey, but that goes the same with most Bloor street bars/restaurant. We tried the guacamole and nachos which were terrific. Will definitely visit again but won't go out of my way for a visit."}
{"text":"Its been years since I dined at the original Playa Cabana on dupont (and had a fantastic time there at that) and with higher then average expectations dined at Coreano last night. Service was top notch and the decor at this location is cool and inviting (extra points for the pachinko machine in mens washroom).

 Food wise, the menu is good, not great. Ceviche (seafood) was nice, the chips are fresh and cripsy, tacos of octopus delivered smiles as did the special taco du jour which was beef and smoked bacon. All in all, the food was good but nothing really stood out, well the coleslaw stood out it was delicious.

Drinks were good but i thought overpriced for the contents.

I wouldn't rush to return but wouldn't dissuade you from going."}
{"text":"I am astonished by the 3.5 yelp rating here. My friends and I stumbled upon this joint yesterday. The tacos blew me away -  I tried the chicken and the baja fish tacos. I wasn't hungry when I arrived, but I couldn't resist. I'll be returning to try more... those tacos were SOLID"}
{"text":"This by far is the best taco place i've ever been too. I always look forward to going when someone mentions it!!"}
{"text":"I was there last Thursday for a girls night and we were not disappointed. It was hard to pick a favourite item on the menu - I really enjoyed the octopus tacos. They also have a delicious Asian pear kimchi. Service was great, despite being busy and I've had a craving ever since!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here on a whim for post-dinner drinks. My friends and I decided to each try a different drink since they are so unique. Upon further questioning, I found out that indeed they were created by the in-house mixologists. We tried the  
Cuban Julep, Habla con Ella, and Winter's Ghost and unanimously agreed the Habla Con Ella was one of the most delicious drinks we've had (we're Manhanttan/Old Fashioned fans).

Upon returning I knew I had to try the food and between the two of us, we had a feast!
Oysters were fresh and served with cucumber juice (unique!).
Tacos - I had the chicken kampungki and fried baja fish (you can also have it grilled) and they were both delish! 
The chips and salsa were also delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh.

Service was great - I had the same server both times I went and he even recognized me when I came back. 

Will definitely make it a point to come back!"}
{"text":"So...I'm not a review-a-holic, so maybe this seems like I just have it out for this place to write this review. I promise, it's just in the interest of letting potential customers know what to expect. The food is expensive. 5-6$ per taco, and while the filling is fairly plentiful, they only give either 1 crispy shell, or two soft corn tortillas. This would work better by reducing the filling portion and price, so the ratio of tortilla to filling makes more sense. I had the braised short rib taco, the chicken tinga taco and the carnitas. Both the short rib and chicken we...okay. I would say the chicken is too salty. The taco was so salty I kept having to scrape off the bits of cotilla cheese crumbles to try and give my mouth respite from the salt onslaught. The beef was salty too, but not overwhelmingly so. I say this as a person who loves salty foods. This could have been possibly ameliorated with a different flavored component...like pickled red onion. That would have cut the salt with a bit of acidity and sweetness and BOOM! A more balanced flavor in the taco. The carnitas...so sad. I was really looking forward to some delicious carnitas. Generally, carnitas is almost like a pork confit. It's slow cooked pork, pulled and then broiled in it's own fat and spices to give it a tender, melt in your mouth pork with a slightly carmelized edge. What did we receive? Dry pork. It was dry pork, that needed to be chewed heavily before swallowing. The flavor of the pork was very underwhelming. But I will say the salsa verde that came with it was really delicious. As for drinks, for a 13$ cocktail, I would say (as others have noted), that the pour was light. However, the cocktail was very very delicious otherwise. The chips and guac were also good, but for 9$, I could likely find equally delicious guac elsewhere. 

Bottom line: Overpriced and underwhelming. Come here for drinks if you want, but if you want good tacos, look elsewhere (Seven Lives, Agave e Aguacate...or make them yourself and be amazed at how easily deliciousness can be acheived!)."}
{"text":"Went around 3:30pm and there was only 2-3 other tables in the restaurant but the servers were hard to find at times. Also, they weren't very attentive. Ordered the tacos and had to ask for the hot sauce plate (good thing saw the pictures on Yelp prior to eating). The server was really nice and explained each hot sauce and ranked it from least to most spicy.

The tacos were definitely really well made, it was amazingly delicious. Only complaint was the Carnitaz De Maciza, the juice from the pork made the taco soggy so it ripped apart when it was lifted up and everything fell out. Ended up eating it off the plate with a fork. Had two Carnitaz, the first one just had juicy tender meat but the second one had some fatty pieces which made it so much better.

Overall, will grab a couple tacos if around the neighbourhood and craving some. Definitely not cheap eats."}
{"text":"Goddamn the smoked BBQ pork ribs. Tacos are a solid bet, try the chihuahua cheese tacos. Cold coronas are perfect."}
