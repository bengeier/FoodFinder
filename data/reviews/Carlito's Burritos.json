{"text":"Wanted something different  and I got it  not your everyday run of the mill burrito I ordered the double meat  pork verde burrito and it was spiced right and I didn't want to stop eating it! Full of flavor and a little sweat to go with it. I ordered rice and beans and the rice was interesting it had carrots in it.The refried beans were not runny and had a good flavor

Make a run to this boarder!"}
{"text":"I'm a fellow New Mexican and was extremely excited to have some real chile and New Mexican cuisine, but I think my bias let me down and I was disappointed in the food here. 

We tried the Frito pies here, which was mostly a heaping plate of Fritos with a few beans and some red chile. It needed more variety with fresh veggies (but again I'm biased and used to making this at home). At home we use a little bit of Fritos and more beans and meat and chile topped with cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato and some sour cream on top. This was mostly chips and chile and was so heavy to eat that I only had a few bites before putting it aside. 

I was also very excited to try the Indian tacos, which were just \"ok\" but again lacked the fresh veggies and just lackluster in flavor. 

The green and red chile were not up to par either. 

I'll just continue to make my own at home, sorry."}
{"text":"I lived in NM for almost 5 yrs and really fell in love with green chile! The 1st time I went, I ordered the stuffed sopapilla with green chile pork verde. It was incredible!! The pork is fork tender, perfectly seasoned, and the green chile has a great flavor and heat as well. Have been back many times and have had no complaints. I have had the tacos, sliders, burritos, and simply ordered the pork verde with green chile. All is amazing. Never had the red chile- I'm strictly a green man! If you like authentic New Mexican cuisine, this is the place for you!! If you want Tex Mex or Americanized Mexican- go find somewhere else to eat as this is not the place for that."}
{"text":"I hadn't  had the chance to try the Chile Relleano ( It;s a Green Chile pepper with cheese inside and batter dipped and deep fried), I didn't get it smothered I ate it plain and it was awesomely great! Normally they have some kind of special going on every day, It was the Slider which are hamburger wrapped in a flour tortilla, it comes with cheese, Chile relish, and a spiced up mayo. I opted to have it plain with cheese and ended up with a side of Red Chile to dip the Sliders in. What can i say I love that Red Chile!!!
People that work there are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Sorry but today I thought I give them another chance since they moved but the food was such a dispoitment,  burritos was cold, my sopia was not cook, I ordered I extra one didn't get it didn't care. Only good thing was my Stella. Never again to bad old place was so good Carne Adovada not the same to bad."}
{"text":"Wish I could say better about the food-3 out of 4 dishes were not good. My burrito was huge and tasty. The drinks and service was excellent. \"Carlita\" the cashier/waitress/bartender was awesome! She made the place. $4 for caddy margarita & $3 draft Modelos tasty & a price can't be beat. 
Stick with the drinks and burritos. Stay away from the sopapillas and the posole. Also, keep in mind this is \"new\" Mexican, despite the numerous Mexican items. Go for the food, stay for the service, come back for the drinks. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! The food was affordable and good quality. I write a travel blog and I'm always looking for ways to save money or find delicious authentic food. The burritos were around 5.60 and for an additional $3 you can add a \"sopapilla\" and 2 sides. My grandmother is from New Mexico and they had some dishes I remember eating when I was a child, like the chile verde stew with shredded beef chunks. 

Overall a great place, if you live in the area or have a car while visiting I suggest taking a ride over to try it out.

{"text":"Carlito's Burritos turns out amazing New Mexican style Mexican food.  They offer both red and green chile both of which are full of flavor and compliment everything on the menu.  I've tried the tamales, the posole, the green chile stew, enchiladas and the breakfast burritos.  All of which were incredible.  The food is fresh, flavorfull and very reasonably priced.  The service is excellent and they make a great $3.00 margarita.  Carlito's is a wonderful local place that everyone should check out!"}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic. The pork stew is my favorite thing on the menu. The legumbres are light and fresh and a nice healthy choice. This place gives you huge portions and everything is super fresh! The dining room is tight and always full, sometimes is hard to get a seat. I heard they are moving so hopefully it's a bigger place. I love Carlitto's!"}
{"text":"new mexican food in las vegas! great food with really good prices. 

the chile is authentic new mexican; both the red and the green are good. in addition to the best out-of-state carne adovada i have had, they are the only place outside of new mexico i have ever seen stuffed sopapillas. you can get fry bread, too! breakfast burritos are big and stuffed full of deliciousness.....good chorizo and bacon and hash browns. legumbres (carrots, jicima, cuc's in fresh lime juice w/ red chile)  make a nice refreshing treat when it is hot out.

they also have a decent beer selection (including a $1 house tap) and now make margaritas...very reasonable prices on good tequila (patron margaritas for $5!).

good stuff....very much recommend it to native and non-native new mexicans alike.

*updated to 5 stars and to include the booze/beer (not really a full bar, but they make some mean margs)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab some good food and cold drinks. I wouldn't call this place Mexican, it's more New Mexico, everything here really revolves around the 'chile' which is a great thing because it's delicious.  

They have daily specials at night which seem great but so far I've only tried the bacon breakfast burrito smothered in green chile and Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red chile with a bunch of toppings. 

The best bite that I've had from here was the Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red cause with several toppings."}
{"text":"Update: Since they have moved, the food is just okay and the owner is unpleasant. He argued with me as to the way the margaritas are now and couldn't help but make sure I was wrong. I feel bad for the waitresses that moved with the restaurant as I would not want him to be my boss. I have not been back in months and refuse to ever return.

Thanks but no thanks.

Taking my business to Juans Flaming Fajitas anytime I need a fajita fix. They are friendly, attentive and won't argue with you when the customer should always be right.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Love this place! The food is always spicy and delicious! I come here at least once a week and always rotate what I order, but I always get their Margaritas! So delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Authentic new mexican cousin , 
I tried the whole menu . Green chilli stew is my favorite   and the carne adovada is so delicious, shrimp tacos are really good ,margaritas, beer, wine  i like everything pretty much , they have alot specials ! Great place to eat , highly recommended !"}
{"text":"A small New Mexican place across Patrick from Home Depot.

The Good:
1. $1 Beers, well Carlito's speacial brew, tasted like Bud Light
2. Sopillas with honey
3. Very clean inside

The Bad
1. My friend and I both ordered chicken dishes, the chicken reminded me of Roberto's and that's not a good thing
2. There were some serioulsy weird people in there, not the staff but the other patrons, I won't be going back for that reason alone.
3. Add $3 to turn your ala carte item into a \"plate\"...I paid $3 to add rice, beans and a sopapilla?  Not a great deal, but it wound up being a lot of food and I took more than half of it home."}
{"text":"Sooo good! New Mexico flavors that can burn your mouth out if you're not careful! Fresh, clean ingredients with deep, rich flavors. Descent menu selection and price. Good bar menu. Courteous and attentive staff that appear to enjoy their job, always important. Very limited, cramped dining room, can get packed during lunch hours, that's why only four stars. Other than that, definitely worth stopping by and partaking of some great Hispanic cuisine that's different than the others without going too crazy!

Update: I wrote my review several months after my visit (I tend to do that) since then they have relocated and the new place has tons of room! That's why they now get that fifth star from me!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Carlito's several times (both dine-in and take-out) and it has become a go-to spot for great burritos.

My wife has an intolerance for gluten so she gets the enchiladas or tacos.  She enjoys both.

I almost always get the Combo Burrito with carne adovado and covered in red sauce.  The red sauce is a roasted chili sauce that is spicy but not overly spicy; but it might be a bit much for some.  The green sauce is excellent, too, with a nice hint of citrus.  And you can get both: one inside and one out!

I've had other meats in the burrito including beef and pork verde.  All were good but the carne adovado is what was uniquely delicious to my taste buds.

Chips and salsa are extra.  I would not spend the money on them; the chips are not great, the red salsa is rather mediocre (though it does also come with the delicious green sauce, too!) and the burrito is enough to stuff anyone.

We have gotten guacamole three times now.  The first time the guac. was delicious and very fresh.  The second two times were rather disappointing and once it was so old that it was brown and inedible, to me.  I would say take a look at it and see how fresh it is before ordering it.

I once got fish tacos and they were not the traditional fish tacos.  They are not served with cabbage or the usual zesty white sauce, but rather, they are just a traditional taco with fried fish.  I liked them even though it wasn't what I was expecting.  But I don't think I would order them again as long as there is a burrito to enjoy.

The interior is very cramped and quite worn.  Come for the food, not the ambiance.  But the food makes for great take-out.

So things are hit and miss on the menu, garnering a 4-star rating but the burritos are 5-star excellent so go for the burrito!"}
{"text":"This place is really good if you like the genuine New Mexico flavor (which I do). One of the better things about this place is that you can get Hatch green chilies in bulk. I always get the ones that are peeled, diced, and frozen. They go great in homemade salsa or scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Best  Mexican food in Henderson. Chili releno  I really liked the Nachos. I got meatless and really liked all the flavors. The soapila pork was overflowing with meat. Too many good things to try"}
{"text":"Wouldn't waste your time...since moving to new location it has gone down hill......big resturant but promoting BBQ not Mexican.... taste has change n cost more....wish it was in old building...not my favorite anymore"}
{"text":"We go to Carlitos at least once a month for New Mexican food. The stuffed sopapillas are my favorite, and my boyfriend always gets a Carlitos Burrito (double meat) smothered in red chile. I always order a sopapilla on the side so I can eat it with honey at the end of the meal. The only thing I have had here that I think could use some improvement is their calabacitas. I would love to see them add fideo to the menu at some point too."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on the star rating, it's \"okay\".  It was a little surprising how small of a serving the Chile rellenos was.   They were good, just small.   Their quesadillas were pretty good.   The chips and salsa were just okay.   We tried one of the spicy Italian sausages and it was very yummy, we might come back and try more bbq."}
{"text":"While I haven't been to this restaurant. I'm seated at the Hilton Hotel and my local bartender is raving about This restaurants green chilies. I'll have to try it."}
{"text":"This is one amazing Tex-Mex joint...small locally owned and great Red or Green Chile!  Breakfast Burritos are half price on Wednesday....I always visit Carlito's when I visit Las Vegas....awesome food!"}
{"text":"A couple of my friends always eat here, so after checking reviews on yelp we decided to give it a try. Hubby and I both liked what we had for lunch and plan to have their breakfast sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks-service is minimal- you order at the bar.  Looks like a lot of their business is takeout.  But worth the inconvenience as the food is great-excellent stuffed sopas and tamales-mushroom stuffed with sausage, smoked chicken,red chili shrimp, green chili stew- all were were excellent.  The kitchen is open and you can smell the smoked chili as they are cooking your meal.  Happy hour specials from 3-5 are great value."}
{"text":"I went yesterday.  Need I say more so so so good. I ate a sopa Xmas style soo good. I am a New Mexico native and miss the food. Love it little piece of New Mexico in are back yard. Note to everyone go hungry lots of food . Deffently going to bring family and friends next time. Only down fall too small not enough tabels."}
{"text":"Being from Denver and all the outstanding mexican food there and the short trip to sante fe nm. I am quite familiar with really good mexican and new mexican food, Carlitos was a welcoming surprise, tastes like i am home and the portions are enough for 2-3 people. Red or green chile, carnitas.....you name frito pie, wow..awesome..."}
{"text":"Chile verde burrito was awesome!  This place is always a great choice.  New location is an upgrade!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this place. Frankly, I was disappointed. They took 30 min to make 2 burritos and pozole. The pozole was also cold. Burrito tasted average. The price was a little bit high compared to other Mexican restaurants and not justifiable compared to other burrito places such as Pepe's tacos and taco y taco."}
{"text":"My first experience with Carlito's and they were out of RICE.  Isn't rice a major staple for Mexican food??? I wasn't told until I had already ordered & was sitting at a table waiting for several minutes. It was still early in the day (lunchtime).  I felt like it was a little early to run out of rice - poor planning.  I had ordered a veggie burrito; so, the rice was a significant ingredient for me - very disappointing.  I decided to go ahead & see what it tasted like anyway.  I was encouraged by the flavor of the green chile and the red chile.  Thus, the higher rating."}
{"text":"Oh man... I had the carne adovada huevos rancheros with Christmas sauce and it was absolutely delicious!  Now, I've been craving it! Which is a total drag, because I live in Ca... Guess I'll be making another trip to Henderson, just to get my fix."}
{"text":"Yelpers are correct! This food actually taste like real Mexican food. The burritos here, hard to beat! The red and the green sauce, both good. Food is \"New Mexico\" style. Yummy!

{"text":"Two dozen times eating and never a bad visit! Green chili fries very good and for me Negra Modelo is the best draft beer with lime!!"}
{"text":"So we got here 630 sat waiting for our food til 730, when I asked for someone to check our order I guess it got lost skipped misplaced. Not sure what happened. The lady that took my order went to the register to look it up.  She said the printer went down. They compd our meal and gave us chips and salsa. Will update review after we get our meal

Ok so after meal update food was very flavorful. Little spicy had me sweating. Will come back will just keep an eye on our order.  Will try red sauce next time."}
{"text":"Wow, since moving to the new location things have gone seriously downhill! The $3 awesome margaritas are now $4, made with cheap tequila and a smaller glass. I would always get the same thing because I loved them, 2 cheese enchiladas and a pork tamale, now it seemed like there was 1 slice of cheese in each, and the tamale which usually has a thin layer of maza and lots of yummy pork now has a 1/2 inch and bare minimum meat. Plus we waited over 30 minutes for our food! Table next to us, 1/2 of them never did get their food and ended up leaving.  The cashier clearly had worked s register long, maybe that's because he was also the bartender and the drink server so you also had to stand there for 15 minutes while he ran around!  Extremely sad, I used to love and rave about this place, but I won't be back now :("}
{"text":"The only place in Las Vegas that has green hatch chilies from New Mexico. The carne abavado and smothered green chili burritos are out of this world! You can also buy the hatch chillies roasted."}
{"text":"Wow, Not really sure why this place would ever have a low review? It seems all the reviews are judging their comparisons on the past location. My experience was extremely positive food was great atmosphere and service was phenomenal!!! Will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! You will not find another place like this in Las Vegas that can punch this much flavor into everything they serve, and at a decent price. Wood fired meats with homemade sauces and rubs. My only challenge is what I'm going to order for my next visit. New Mexican or BBQ?"}
{"text":"We come here all of the time and it's amazing. We love the owner he is always hands on and that's why this place stands out."}
{"text":"I wish I lived on this side of town so I can come here more. But it's always a nice treat when I make the drive. Closest I can get to home in Las Vegas. If you are from NM then you know what I am talking about. By no means mexican food. Something similar to text mex if you are familiar with that. But to me it's, home. Love this place and digging the new location. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious... I wasn't expecting such a tasty and fresh meal. A variety of options from shrimp tacos to Bbq brisket. I ordered the shrimp tacos. Yum! 

This place is \"tucked away\" in a business park and the signage is confusing because it's connected/related to another restaurant, but please look past it because the food is tasty. 

There's a main dining area between the two establishments. Two distinct options are better than one so to me it's a plus..."}
{"text":"If your from New Mexico or just love New Mexico green chile, this is the place to go.  It is the only place on Las Vegas/Henderson to serve authentic, fresh New Mexico Hatch green chile.  We have been buying 30 pound bags of the stuff from them for years now. The food is amazing and fast. The environment if very casual and relaxing.  You can order anything from a smothered burrito with green chile, red chile, or Christmas style (both) to stuffed sopapillas and Frito pie.  It has all the great flavors of New Mexico.  The only thing missing form the menu is a green chile burger (can't understand why they don't sell these!)  Everything is great though and prices are cheap."}
{"text":"Authentic New Mexican food.  Everything here is amazing, I always order the stuffed sopapilla, with red and green sauce.  The posole and green chili stew are also stellar choices.  All super spicy and amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and for the most part it has been good. There is however, a long wait time and it seems they're always short staffed. As for the food, it is very good and do recommend their burritos. Their image/presentation needs improvement though."}
{"text":"It's too bad the service is so terrible here because the food is actually good, if you get what you even ordered. Sucks I'll have to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the burrito in the bowl with the Carne adovada. The meat was very good and tender, the green chili sause was good but on the bland side, the rice and beans needed salt but overall pretty good. I tried the Roswell Margarita. It was really delicious. The dining room was a little warm but all in all I'm sure we'll be back

It was my first time here, but won't be the last :)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday begins usually after 4:00 PM. Also, they advertise 1 Dollar pints. The food difficult to rate because its hit or miss, the meat maybe tender or tough, dry or juicy. Good Luck Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I just found this spot a few months ago and now I drive across town for this food at least once a week. Pork Verde burrito smothered in red every time. Sopapillas are the bomb too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Found this place a couple of years ago through groupon and was hopeful, as my family is from New Mexico and I lived there for a while back in high school  I was not disappointed.  The prices are great, the portions large and they serve only Hatch chili!  When I discuss Carlito's with fellow New Mexicans, we agree that this is our hidden gem in Las Vegas for a taste of home.  Although it is a bit cramped and definitely a hole in the wall, the food is always consistantly good and service friendly.  This place is usually busy and definitely cramped.  Even got to eat next to the lovely Dina Titus during a busy Saturday morning.  Obviously, she knows where to get some good grub!

People don't realize the diffierence between Mexican and New Mexican food and it really comes down the chili.  I love both but I can't live without my Hatch chili!  Everything I have had here is super tasty!  Love when they bring the BBQ pit out front and you can get racks of ribs to go at a super reasonable price.  Although everything has been great there, they have the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!  Sorry mom.  I always get the chorizo, smothered christmas tree style! (red and green chili for the novice)  For those who don't like the spicier side of life, they have other great options to satisfy your hunger pangs.  Just don't forget your sopapillas!  They will make your tastebuds so happy, you might forget the spice that just reaked havoc on your tongue!

My opinion--GO!  TO CARLITO'S BURRITOS"}
{"text":"This place had the best tacos I had on my whole trip in the US. It is a great little place with enough seating options and the service is fast. 
If you are in Las Vegas and look for something off strip then I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to all things green chile.  This place is the business.  Giant smothered burritos, frito pies, sopapillas and honey, cheap ass drinks, tasty margaritas, and friendly ladies behind the counter.  Go.  Get your green chile on, get your drink on, and make friends."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Mexico, so of course i love this place! The food is always spot on but the past few times i stopped by i was a little disappointed to say the least. I have been coming here since opening week when it was just the owner taking orders,  so it's obvious i like Carlitos. However, the service has been subpar the few times I've made my way there from Summerlin. The small lady that wears a headband/bandana and takes orders can be very rude at times and each time i've gone the person bringing out my food is wearing flip-flops or shower slippers (!!!!!)... Maybe it's just me but I do not think that is ok at all. :( My New Mexico food deserves better! I love Carlitos and I've been contemplating on writing this but seeing the flip-flops a few days ago did it for me. :/ The FOOD IS DELICIOUS though!!! :)"}
{"text":"the owner (fat white guy) is kind of a jerk, but the prices are reasonable and the food is really good.  and actually their green chiles are delicious.  i love their burritos and the friday fajitas.

also, they have great daily specials and their stuffed sopapillas are good too.

5 for the food, minus 1 for the jerk."}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food while driving back to Vegas from seeing Hoover Dam. We found Carlitos Burritos on yelp and decided to give it a try. The food was delicious! I highly recommend the Carlitos Combo...the Soppapilla that came with our meal was the perfect finishing touch!"}
{"text":"So where else do you go in the valley for frybread? New Mexican cuisine is very different from regional mexican or tex-mex or Peruvian, etc. and if you're a fan of the other side of Arizona then Carlito's does an admirable job.

Yes, you have to go to New Mexico at this point to find the award winners but what other choices do we have? I think Carlito's beats where there ain't any. I hope others get the idea; every time I've been there's a crowd.

I had the Navajo Taco which probably needs adjustment but the green pork  burrito (wet) with lettuce, tomato and cilantro on top of it all really made me happy happy. Oh yeah, don't forget the calabacitas inside for your good health.

There's nothing to say about sopapillas - if you haven't had one or two then oh well. But if you know what a churro is then you better get going.
Now.

So Carlito's is beyond okay 'cause everyone I've taken along so far really likes it/them."}
{"text":"I was going to give this little place 4 stars because of the small dining area, but the food gets 6 stars; hence it gets 5 stars. This is the best green chili in the city. It's New Mexico style which is hard to find in Las Vegas for some inexplicable reason. The green chili is spicy with bits of the green chili in it. This is as opposed to the blended and smooth version which can be equally good. I ordered stuffed sopapilla that is also a New Mexico specialty not easily found in Las Vegas,  Mine was stuffed with ground beef. The order was served in an aluminum to-go container. I received two sopapillas with cheese melted over them and surrounded by plenty of the first rate green chili. It was a generous and delicious portion. For those of you who crave green chili, I can highly recommend this place. One other thing. They have a nice selection of beers as well as margaritas."}
{"text":"Being familiar to New Mexican food, having family & resided there, I wouldn't consider this the most authentic; however, for the price and their Sunday Breakfast Burrito - buy one get one free deal, I don't have much to complain about. We frequent nearly every Sunday and enjoy their Chicken Breakfast Burrito smothered Christmas Style (Green & Red Chili) along with a $1 Carlito Tap Brew. Not only do we cash in on their 2 for 1 but they also offer a loyalty reward patrons can cash in on. We simply filled out a simple form and give our name after we order. After spending $50 you receive a credit for $5 on your next order; which, nearly makes your next trip free! 
We love the early staff but strongly dislike the evening staff. 
As they're popularity grows, seating can be a hassle. The atmosphere is extremely casual and I love football season at Carlito's. They have a few flatscreens and also don't shy from  accommodating their patrons with requests from their DirectTV listings. 
If you are unfamiliar with this type of cuisine but are looking to cure your craving for spicy but flavorful... Try their Carne Adovada Enchiladas. It is a one of a kind entree that should have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great new Mexican style cooking here! Taco Tuesday's are great! $1 tacos and they always have a $1 draft beer!"}
{"text":"This is \"New\" Mexican food! I think you have to be from NM to appreciate the food. They don't have red sauce or green sauce, they actually have red chile and green chile. Most of the burritos are all meat and don't have rice and lettuce as a filler like other places. Also, the tortillas are real flour, thick and not paper thin. You can get flat enchiladas with an egg on top, stuffed sopapillas, frito pies, tortilla burgers, posole and much more. NM is a melting pot of all nationalities that share one thing in common, chile (red or green). So, I hope Vegas will keep this place around. It is a touch of home."}
{"text":"Solid New Mexican experience...it's not The Frontier in Albuquerque, but the green chile and carne adovada are solid, the portions are very generous and they get extra points for having a self-service Horchata fountain."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because they didn't have much selection on the menu. My husband and I ordered 2 Burritos, chips and salsa, 2 sopapillas, and a drink and the total came up to $25. The \"upgrades\" got us. 

The burritos were pretty huge but most things on the menu were spicy. The only thing I could get my 3yr old son were unseasoned chips, (because even their regular chips have sprinkles of chili powder) and a cinnamon sugar sopapilla. I got a chicken burrito with black beans, rice and red chile sauce. They give you two options: Red or Green chile sauce. My husband got Carne Adovado Burrito (spicy pork in red sauce) and he did not like it. He didn't even finish it and he's a Burrito guy. 

So no second time for me for this place."}
{"text":"Decent food. Not great. The cheese enchiladas are OK. I would avoid the tortillas burger and the Chile cheese fries. Plenty of Chile, very little cheese. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere, however. 
Good price for what it is. Respectable,  not fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was pretty bad. First, the girl who took our order saw us waiting at the register and continued to eat in front of us and talk to her coworkers before she came over and rudely took our order. She talked fast and wouldn't look at us as if she had better things to do than her job. Pretty bad experience. But like I said the food was great. Still don't know if we'll be back."}
{"text":"best pork verde anywhere!! And we can't get enough of the green chiles. Love Eileen and the rest of the staff.  See you all soon!"}
{"text":"Just to put it bluntly this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I am from New Mexico and he has the best New Mexican dishes available outside the state of New Mexico. Having recently returned from New Mexico I think his new Mexican dishes may even be better than the ones in New Mexico he has combined the best of every restaurant in New Mexico  the best posole was at the frontier restaurant his equals that, there is not a breakfast burrito in New Mexico that compares to his, And he has specials that could not be touched even in New Mexico."}
{"text":"First off, I hear people complain that this isn't authentic Mexican food. Well, it isn't Mexican food. It's **New Mexican** food, just like you'll find down in the Land of Enchantment. 

I LOVE New Mexican cuisine, green chile, and I love Carlito's! I've been a fairly regular customer since they opened and have yet to be disappointed with the food or the service. The staff is always friendly and most of them even remember my name- a real rarity these days. The restaurant is very small and does tend to get really crowded during peak meal times. However, even when they are busy the service is still pretty quick. 

My favorites are the Carlitos Burrito with chicken or pork verde smothered in green chile and the pork verde stuffed sopapilla smothered green. If you like it extra spicy like I do, ask for a side of napalm sauce (essentially, it's a habanero purée!!) with your order. Burns. So. Good. 

Occasionally on Saturdays, they do an oak pit BBQ tri-tip. It gets served up on a garlic roll with green chile and cheese and chile seasoned fries. This has got to be one of the best sandwiches ever made. If you get the chance, this sandwich doesn't disappoint (and it's big enough for two). 

In the fall, they bring in Hatch green chiles and sell them by the bushel. You can pick them up fresh or they will roast them for you.  The smell of roasting chilies is almost a religious experience. 

If you love New Mexican cuisine, stop in and give Carlitos a try."}
{"text":"I have always been an big Chipotle fan and enjoy Cafe Rio. After eating here I will make them my burrito of choice!  I had the carne burrito with rice, refried beans, black beans, lettuce and had it smothered in red sauce. It was stuffed with meat and it was delicious. They have a surf and turf burrito which I will try next time but did not want to pay $18 dollars for my first visit in case the food was bad. We did take out but the dining room looked clean and inviting. They are hidden behind Joe's Crab Shack, does not seem to be a great location but I hope they have continued success!  They will continue to get my business."}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday morning to try the well known breakfast burrito, and turned out it is in deed the best breakfast burrito I've had so far. The guy took our order was cool, don't be fooled by his staunch poker face. 

There is a takeout section adjacent to the dining area, we got confused when first stepped in, but just walk in a bit further and menu is stacked in the basket in front of the bar counter. Pet friendly patio is also available. Very casual place. If you want no bullshit but good food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food at Carlito's is OK.  I can't think of anything better to say about it.  

The green chile is New Mexico chile, cooked a little untraditionally, but close enough to the real thing, that someone who has lived in New Mexico finds it somewhat familiar, but lacking the gustatory punch of really well-prepared New Mexican green chile.

The flour tortillas are of poor quality and have a tendency to fall apart.  The refried beans are so bland they border on baby food.  And the atmosphere, well, it's like a taqueria: noisy, cheap, crowded.

It's good for someone looking for a green chile fix, but probably not the place to eat for really good New Mexican food"}
{"text":"I initially found out about this place through a coupon service. The 1st three times I got the fries smothered in red chiles and a breakfast item. I dined in once and remembered that the service was pleasant.
But tonight was eye opener. I called to place a pick up order and the lady I spoke to had a very bad attitude plus she took down the wrong order. I ordered a combo burrito and she took it upon herself to charge me for a Carlito's burrito which is a dollar more. She urged me to make up my mind about beans and rice because she had a line of people. I'm sorry but when I asked if I can place an order over the phone, and she saying yes, was guarantee that I was a paying customer, just like everyone else. If you don't have the integrity to treat all customers as customers, then don't take phone orders.
I arrive 15 minutes later to pick up the food and when I arrived she was behind the cash register. She looked at me and then walked into the dining area to bus a couple of tables. So, as a customer who is present, now the empty tables are more important than the customer. I see the problem now. She is discriminant towards particular customers in an inconsistent manner. She had a tip jar that was filled, but to be honest with you, if she treated everyone like she treated me, that jar would have nickels and pennies. The whole transaction had no greeting, no thank you or appreciation for business and couldn't even muster up a smile. I had like 13 cents change, and that tip jar was not deserving of a penny. 
The 2 stars was because my friend liked the burrito, and the fries I ordered had flavor. 
I don't know how Zagat grades these businesses, but if they send secret shoppers they will see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"If you love authentic New Mexican food, you will want to roll in the green chili at carlitos. I have never had a bad meal here and I've been going to carlitos for over 7years. Stuffed sopapillas are amazing! Breakfast burritos are amazing! Green chili stew is amazing! You can't go wrong, this place is amazing! Also the staff is wonderful and the facility is always clean. Great job carlitos!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I walked into this place for the first time. I love Carlito's!!! I take all of my friends here when they visit from out of town. 
There's so many good things about Carlito's all of their weekday specials, dollar beers, & friendly staff. 
It's always an enjoyable experience here. 
So glad you're right down the street from me. 

If you haven't tried don't hesitate this place is the best around!"}
{"text":"Im a New mexico native living in vegas and this is the only place I have found that can satisfy my green chile craving. Good prices and large portiins."}
{"text":"I tried a green chili pork Tamale and their special of the day Chile Relleno. I really loved the Chile Relleno. Crisp on the edges, plenty of melty cheese inside. The rice and beans were hot and fresh. Great!! I will definitely revisit.

It's tight on room in the dining area, and the line to order takes up half the room. There is a friendly atmosphere that made it feel like friends and family."}
{"text":"My new favorite mom and pop Mexican...oops sorry New Mexico food. And yes there is a difference between the two.

This is a small little counter service restaurant that has seating for maybe 30 people.  It looked like they get a lot of to go orders though. 

A friend of mine who lived in New Mexico 30 years goes here quite frequently and mentioned I should go try it with him.  Well, I love me a good pork burrito with verde sauce and that's exactly what I had. I ordered the Carlito's Burrito Double Meat (no beans) with pork verde. When I ordered, I was warned about the heat level... no problem though... That was buy far the best Chile verde sauce I have ever had and my burrito was drowning in it, which is just the way I like it.  The pork was cooked perfectly.  I was amazed I was able to finish the whole think, but I pretty much didn't eat until the next day.

The staff there are very friendly and it is run like a family business. They seem to have a lot of Latino clientele which to me is a good sign and a testament to the food."}
{"text":"I used to love this place... They got rid of the Carlitos burrito I was told by a new person that I've never seen working before and what I got was crappy ground beef burrito stuffed with filler... I don't mind paying more for the burrito that I actually liked.... and no red Chile sauce I got some red pico crap that was awful... You guys were doing good because it worked.... Some dumb ass mess it all up... Not going back or recommending anymore....  Same level as Robertos"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here for years. The burritos are huge and always delicious. My favorite is the breakfast burrito with bacon. I will keep coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Very unwelcoming environment. Awkward setup, don't bother coming here unless you enjoy being ignored."}
{"text":"I traveled clear across town to try this place out and my wife and I were disappointed, to say the least. 
First off, when you walk in the door, it's very confusing. There's a couple signs when you first walk in and you'll find yourself standing there reading signs to figure out where you need to go next and what to do. The whole time your standing there reading these signs, you'll have employees standing around, looking at you like you're a big inconvenience!
So we got to the area where you dine in and I had to ask someone behind the counter if we sit down and the order or if we order at the register and then sit down??
After we got that hammered out, I almost stroked out while looking at their full a la carte menu. They nickel and dime you for every stupid thing there. For instance, a burrito $x.xx, add pork $x.xx, add cheese $x.xx, add whatever! They charged you for every single thing. They even charge for chips and salsa! I'm surprised they didn't charge me $1.25 to walk in the front door!
I will say the food was alright. It wasn't horrible but the atmosphere, customer service, the cost and the overall experience sucked!
Maybe I'm biased as I'm a regular at Chile Addiction but when I go there, they can't give you enough chips and salsa and guess what. When you order something like a burrito or enchiladas stack, they don't nickel and dime you for each stupid little thing. It just comes with it all. Then they give you as many sopapilla's as your belly can handle!
This place needs to have some serious change or they will never have return customers, like myself. I won't be returning there. Instead, I'll hit the other New Mexico style place in the SW part of town. It's so much more for less money."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out. You need to get in your car, buy a Carlito's burrito, ask for it smothered in green chili and taste it; you can thank me for the tip later. The nachos too have this sweet spice on it and even when you're at the bottom cause you ate all your nachos in one sitting, you'll still find cheesy goodness at that last bite waiting for you. Great place."}
{"text":"This is hands-down, one of the best restaurants in town. My husband and I have been here to eat many times and the food is consistently excellent. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is super friendly. When it came time to decide on what food to serve at our intimate backyard wedding, the choice was clear. Dave (the owner) worked with us on creating a menu of our favorite foods and arrived the day of our wedding prepared and professional. And of course, the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carlito's since they were on Patrick Ln. Food quality is still superb. I recommend the stuffed sopapilla"}
{"text":"I am a New Mexico expat. Carlitos does it right. Carne Adovado  Burrito smothered in green chili can't be beat"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! This place is always packed!! I work as a nail tech next door and find myself here all the time for lunch or dinner;) Love it... but it may be time to watch the waist line! LOL!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricy I have to say. I ordered a breakfast Burritto like everyone else. The confusing thing about this place is them asking you what kinds of chili would you like. The green chili was spicy but very flavorful. The red wasn't so great.  It tasted powdery. Overall the burrito was big and lots of flavor.  A little dry though.  Will definitely come back to try a different kind."}
{"text":"So I went eagerly today to get me a burrito. It's sad to say but it was a disappointment. I ordered the beef burrito. I assumed it was a steak burrito but it's really ground beef with no flavor. I guess I should of asked about the type of beef but I assumed it was steak like usual. I think ill try it again one more time."}
{"text":"Not the Carlitos New Mexican cuisine of the former location. What an extreme disappointment the pork chile verde burrito in a bowl was a poor excuse of mild watery liquid,, pinto lack the cooked in flavor, not able to eat bowl of watery soup out of a pie plate with a fork. Whethe re is the substantial, thicker more flavor filled delight of the former Carlitos. My companions chicken burrito with calabacitas (always orders the same) was also lackluster. He said this not like the Carlito hatch green chili and I see no reason to bother with the drive again. It is as if someone bought the name and menu but not the recipes. Such a disappointment. This is NOT like New Mexican cuisine served at old location."}
{"text":"What's happened?!   This used to be our favorite place, but this having to wait on ourselves with an ever changing work crew is tiring.  When they were on Patrick you understood the standing in line to order, but please can someone wait on me and ask me if I want another beer.  Instead I've got to stand in line.  And then your beer selection is limiting. Saturday night and hardly anyone is here. I think that says enough."}
{"text":"This is a review by proxy. My mom grew up in New Mexico and is a Mexican Food expert. She waxes poetic about this place. The green chile is amazing and its classic NM food. The rice and beans are perfect. It's classic New Mexican food. Only place like it in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for a taste of New Mexico this place is the real deal.  I've been craving some carne adovada for some time now - a visit here satisfied that craving!  Good food, reasonable prices and well maintained.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Carlito's is crazy delicious. I really like their food. Eating it is great. Their hatch green chiles make things delicious and spicy."}
{"text":"Grew up in  Santa Fe, NM..You cannot get Northern NM food as good as Carlitos Burritos. Can you say \"Christmas?\" Yes this reminds so much of the food I grew up with. Thanks for bringing the taste of home to Las Vegas, NV!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if they have different owners than the previous location but was definitely disappointed with Carlitos. To start the entry is definitely confusing especially when it's busy.  The girl taking our order said it was okay to order from her since midway through our order she sensed we wanted to dine in.  We ordered the burritos and I'm not sure what they brought us.  The old Carlitos location use to smother the burrito with red or green sauce and put the sour cream, onions tomato on the top.  The burritos we got today were wrapped in foil and were cold.  No sauce on them and the fixings were inside probably contributed to the cold burrito.  Don't get me started on the taste, I remember the green sauce packing a punch with spice and flavor that was also not present today.  
On a brighter note the sopapillas were tasty, the only thing we enjoyed, but probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"It's definitely something a little different than what most people here in Vegas are used to, but I've had better. The customer service was good and the portions were huge, just left me a little unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Burritos and tamales and tacos, oh my! There's no place like home... Unless you happen to be close to Carlito's Burritos, then home is close to you. Mexican food can be had anywhere, but true New Mexican food is much harder to find outside the state. Carlito's is THE REAL DEAL. Chile like my mom makes, tamales that would have made my grandmother proud! There's something for everyone in Las Vegas, for me there's Carlito's."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about? This place has very bland,American style food that was not worth the price. Taco Bell is as good and cheaper. The burrito I had here sucked! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The absolute best New Mexican food in las vegas and one of my favorite places to eat. I love this place so much, can't rave enough about it. If you like spicy, try a meat burrito with pork smothered in green chile with Serrano peppers and jalapeños. It's hot but amazing!"}
{"text":"My New Mexican friend brought me here, so I could experience the food she grew up with. I got the pork quesadilla and steak nachos. The quesadilla was delicious with tender stewed pork that was a bit spicy. I could definitely get that again. My friend got the taco with the same pork. I tried it and it was also good. I liked the Indian bread they use as the taco shell. Unfortunately, the nachos were not good. There wasn't much meat and they were hard to find. The few pieces that seemed to be tossed in there were tiny and tough. 

However, I really liked the other things enough that I could give them more stars. I'm not going to do that because the service was not great. The woman taking our order was unfriendly and impatient. She never smiled, said thank you or greeted us. 

I noticed that the owner replied to other customers that said the same thing about the service. Either he did not talk to his staff as he said he would or he's just all talk because his staff is still unfriendly. To make things worse, his business received a C rating from the health department. That means they're not clean. It makes sense that they don't care about their cleanliness when they keep rude people like that on their staff. A business that doesn't care enough. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is great and they have great prices. I'm new to the area and have been looking for a place that had great food and hatch style green Chile; this place rocked it. Wonderful customer service and a clean restaurant. Check them out!!"}
{"text":"We love Carlitos, and have been coming since the day they opened. The only reason it isn't 5 (or 6) stars is because I think it's past time to expand. You're too busy for that small space, which is awesome! Time to take the plunge Dave! 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there on a Saturday. The first thing is, as many people have mentioned, it's really not clear what to do when you walk in. The front door leads to the Take Out counter, so if you want to eat in you go to the bar and order. Did not help that the guy behind the bar was minimally attentive.

The food was OK. Can't say much more than that. We had chips and guacamole - the chips were a bit hard, and the guacamole was really plain. My wife had the shrimp bowl (medium size). The shrimp was fine, but the other ingredients (mostly lettuce) were pretty paltry. I had the chile rellenos which had good flavor, but the portion was small. For about $9 they should consider adding some rice and beans to the dish to round it out some.

It's not that anything was bad...but if I'm going to spend my money eating out, you gotta go beyond what this place offered us today."}
{"text":"Closest thing to being in Albuquerque.  Sunday's are 2 for 1 breakfast burritos !!  If you get the huevos rancheros make sure to get them to put the tomatoes and lettuce.  Seems a little week without it."}
{"text":"The chicken combo burrito is damn good. I get it nearly every week. While the quality of the chicken may vary at times, it's usually on point. Get it with the calabacitas and call it a day (or lunch). I can put it down, but I assume it'll be too big for some so take a burrito buddy b/c you are not allowed to waste this delicacy."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how people stay in business with sub par cooking especially Mexican food.  I bought four breakfast burritos from this place.  The food was very bland.  It's doesn't take that much to put salt on your eggs.  The green chile and red chile hot sauce was horrible!  It also was bland.  Don't even waste your time going to this place. It's not odd.  Everyone in the family who had your chile found it disgusting.  It doesn't take much to try your own food."}
{"text":"Carlitos for the win!!! I can't remember having a better burrito maybe ever in my life.

The crazy part is Ive been eating here for 5 years and never reviewed this place before. 

Carlitos is always great food. Like The type if food that after you eat it leaves a smile on your face because it was so good and was exactly what you had pictured in your brain when ordering. 

My biggest problem when eating here is that I cant eat more. The burritos are huge. 

The fajitas on fridays are probably the best I've had in Vegas as well. 

Now lets talk about the new location. 
Awesome!! So much bigger and a great lay out. And on a personal level so much better for me because its like a block from my house. 

They have a nice bar and looks like 6 beers on tap to choose from and a few bottles as well. Looks like they have a few wines too. 

I obviously recommend giving this place a shot of you haven't."}
{"text":"Delicious, filling, obviously quality ingredients.  The woman at the register was very helpful and I could tell she actually cares about the lost art of customer service."}
{"text":"O.M.G
The \"new\" location has not changed the tasty goodness of this New Mexico soul food. The intensity of the rich smells filled my nostrils immediately when we walked inside.
The dining area is much much larger than the old restaurant with tv's to catch a game. There is the other option of sitting outside. I can envision this place packed at lunch. I went late in the evening on Sunday probably too close to closing, but still greeted with smiles. 
First to nibble on was the tortilla chips. Avocado & salsa were so fresh. Any fresher & i would have to slap it! 
I had a burrito bowl...the bomb. The burrito bowl was filled with New Mexico warmth & goodness. 
Sister had a bowl of soup-a bowl not a cup. Both filled us up. A to go box was on hand.
It's a go back. Definitely returning for some soul food!"}
{"text":"Finally, great New Mexican cuisine in Las Vegas.  You'll clear your sinuses while having fantastic red and green chile delights..along with sopapillas and maybe the odd chile relleno or two.  Dang, I shouldn't have written this review..I'm just making myself hungry again.  One of the hidden gems in the desert."}
{"text":"I read a lot about this place and heard quite a bit as well. So I found myself in the area and decided to give them a try. I was there early so I ordered a ham and egg breakfast burrito. I also asked for it to be smothered in the green salsa. I enjoyed the salsa it was good and had a good kick! I also liked the fact that it was a big burrito. The burrito said it had hash brown but the hash brown was like potato strings. I had hoped it had more hash brown in it. Overall the burrito was good but not great. I would definitely try something else again mostly since the salsa was very good."}
{"text":"Serious customer service issues since relocating.. Whether or not the food is good, doesn't give you the right to be rude.  This is the second time I've called (two different days) to place a pickup order, and she answers the phone and puts me on eternal hold.. I can hear a whole-lot-of-nothing going on in the background before I give up and hang up. So when I come in and u ask me if I called in and I tell u \"I tried..\" don't play dumb like the phone isn't working because your boss is standing right there. Yeah you've been getting calls, but you don't tend to them..
Hire some more staff, because the ones you have are obviously overwhelmed.."}
{"text":"We went to eat here yesterday and as we were ordering we noticed a C rating from SNHD. Now I'm not a horribly fussy person, for the record I have eaten there in the past and enjoyed the food, but the C rating bothered me. I asked the woman who was taking the order about the C rating, she made a face acted very odd and blew me off. I asked again and she rudely told me she had just returned from her days off and knew nothing about it. The C rating really bothered me knowing that a C rating is one step from being closed down, and her sketchy behavior really didn't help the matter so we cancelled our order and left. To the owner I do understand and realize that perhaps inquiring about a rating may be considered rude. However perhaps some customer service training may be in order considering as a regular customer I have seen the woman working the cash register before, she stands out as she has bragged to me and other customers that she's so involved in the restaurant and prominent that people think she's the owner. A simple polite \"I'm not sure would you like to contact the owner or manager\" would have been acceptable. From a customers stand point I made it clear that I had been there before and enjoyed the food at 8 1/2 months obviously pregnant my inquiry was purely concern and not to put the restaurant down. Despite the fact that this is the only place in Las Vegas I can get the New Mexican food I enjoyed eating in my hometown of Santa Fe, the C rating they currently have, the C rating they had last May (according to the SNHD website), their poor customer service, lack of regard for regular customers. I will not return, and have already told several friends (who eat there) about my experience."}
{"text":"This is authentic New Mexican food! Not an imitation. Not Mexican food. No need to travel to New Mexico anymore. I rate this place a 6!  You have to try this."}
{"text":"Stopped by Carlitos today for some green chill stew and a Cadillac.  Delicious as always.  Just what I needed to make me feel better!"}
{"text":"With the abundance of good quick Mexican eateries in the area; a new one has to be pretty special to get my business. I ordered the chicken enchiladas dinner plate. The enchiladas were okay, but small for the price. The dinner plate included lots of standard-fare rice and beans, some shredded lettuce, and one good sopapilla (served with honey). Strangely, when I asked, they didn't have any hot sauce available.

I didn't like the fact that the plate on which the food was served was an aluminum take-out container - with no place to recycle it in-store. Incredibly wasteful, and not eco-friendly. 

I also found the loud TV's - one blaring some FOX \"news\" political program and the other offering a screaming football match - to be really REALLY annoying. 

I won't be going back. Plenty of other good places that offer better food without the propaganda."}
{"text":"We love this place. Within a few visits this became our favorite Mexican Restaurant in the area. Love the nachos and the burritos. Can't get enough! I also like the options of green or red chilis. Staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is some patrons favorite. Gave it a try today-sorry can not recommend. I don't like eating out of aluminum pans. And the navajo taco
Wasn't up to quality standards. Old, dried meat. I don't like writing bad reviews, but this one fits."}
{"text":"Went today to get my favorite, Shrimp burrito with guacamole, pico, cheese and green chili inside. It wasn't the same as the old place on Patrick and Pecos. It wasn't loaded with shrimp, everything was at the bottom of the burrito(not thru out) and just didn't taste the same, I'll give them one more try, but I was not impressed! Miss the old place!"}
{"text":"The chili verde taco on the frybread (in place of traditional tortilla) is amazing and will be my first stop whenever I am in the area. They also do Santa Maria BBQ in the same building (also very good)."}
{"text":"Carlito's burritos is a def good reminder of all the good eats and memories of new Mexico I loved the food even though it was prepared a-little Different from what I'm use to I guess I just have to lower my standers a tad bit when it comes to eating new Mexico cuisine in las Vegas nv I mean nothing is ever like home. So anyways about the food it was great I liked it and so did the party of six I went with. Minus one * due too it being set up like a Roberto's taco show I was expecting more of a sit down type atmosphere with a waitress/waiter hmm well next time I will know what to expect good food and glad to see that there trying to bring the new Mexico style to the city of sin would I recommend it yes support the home town rock on enjoy good eats."}
{"text":"Fajita Friday! Shrimp for me & steak for him plus sides and a pitcher for $40. Got veggie options too & good quality. No refried beans you can drink with a straw! Whole beans....."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast burrito in town...  Fausto's is good, but when you want green chili sauce, Carlito's is your place!  For cheap$$, they will smother anything you order in the green chili if you want, and I always want!  It seemed extra spicy this morning which was perfect, but I could only eat half.  The other half will be in the toaster oven later and will still be delicious.  Sunday is 2 for 1 breakfast burrito's all day. Too early for the $1 beer special, but I have taken advantage of that before as well.   If not a breakfast burrito, then the carne adovada with the calabacitas is my go to burrito... smothered of course.   And when I want to go low carb, they do it in a bowl and it is fantastic.  They usually have a line  but it moves fairly quick and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom.....THE BEST Mexican Food in Vegas, and we've tried many places.   If you enjoy NM/Colorado style Mexican Food, with Spicy Green Hatch Chili sauce, this place will become your favorite.   A great amount of heat that doesn't hide the flavor.   The burritos are huge and if you are ever there on a weekend when they are cooking their tri-tip, DO NOT drive by without stopping for a Tri Tip sandwich, smothered in cheddar and green chili sauce.   We drive over 20 miles to eat there from the West side of town and it's worth ever cent of gas money and time to do so."}
{"text":"Love LOVE this place. They recently relocated to a huge space. If we're nearby around breakfast time, I love the huevos rancheros. We also use their take-out catering for larger groups. At Christmas we fed a group of 20 and got rave reviews on the carne adovada, green chile pork and enchilada casserole. For my husbands birthday party we picked up ribs (probably the best I've ever had), grilled chicken, sausages and tri-tip for a group of 20. Wow. So much good stuff. They always hit the mark. They have a discount program and offer $5 off your bill for every $100 you spend. All the more reason to go! A lot."}
{"text":"Carlitos is awesome. Finally a place in Vegas that has REAL Green and Red Chile. Roberto's, Faustos, and any other bland place that uses can chile is no comparison. This place makes you feel like your in New Mexico with its authentic flavors. I know its not fair in comparing them to anything else here. I'm a little biased because I think New Mexican cuisine is far more superior then Tex-Mex, or Mexican. What I do compare is the style of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos. Hands down Carlitos has them beat. Any of there burritos you can get real red or green chile inside them as well as smothered. The nachos with red Chile powder sprinkled on the chips and green chile hidden inside give the nachos a taste that is incredible. Navajo Tacos and Stuffed sopapillas are amazing. You haven't had a real Frito pie until you try it with the red new mexico chile Carlitos uses. They also have $1 drafts and specials everyday. Like $1 Santa Fe sliders. A little burger, with chipotle sauce and onions and tortilla. Keep in mind that this is New Mexican cuisine and not the stuff everyone is use to who never been to New Mexico. Its definitely better and I'm glad I have a place to have my Red and Green Chile fix since I only go to New Mexico a couple times a year. Before I go, you give them your email and # they add you and you get 5% discount every time you dine. Until next time, Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a spicy burrito, and that's what I got. On my sous chef's recommendation, I hit up Carlito's for some New Mexican fare, a culinary branch I'm totally unfamiliar with. The offerings at Carlito's seemed similar to a classy Roberto's with a few pleasing twists (calabacitas, fried egg on enchiladas, green chili sauce, etc).

I went with a wet combo green chili pork burrito with all the free fixins inside. I was warned it would be spicy-- it was. I like heat and it was a perfect amount. I enjoyed the pork meat, too. I also got the $3 sides and sopapilla option. The bread was not my style (greasy and doughy) and my two sides were just alright (posole and chili). I love hominy so I fished out the pieces in the posole and enjoyed those. I would not do the upgrade to my meal again since I hardly ate any of it.

Overall, 4 stars. My burrito was enormous and tasty."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town if you're from new Mexico or have ever enjoyed red and green chile sauce smothered over your burrito.  If you're not familiar with this type of cuisine I would still suggest trying it out along with the house brew.  Real Hatch, NM green chiles!!!!"}
{"text":"As close as I have found to New Mexico food here in Vegas. Had breakfast and lunch. New Mexico hatch Chile. Mmmmmm. Need a fix for New Mexico food this is it the bomb beer wine & margaritas $1.00 tap beer"}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks ago. I got a couple tacos and they were okay. It took awhile to get out"}
{"text":"Food is so good and authentic. Yesterday I had the sliders, smothered fries, Navajo taco, and sopapilla. After work today heading back down there. If you want something to eat that taste great and you will not find anywhere else in Vegas, Carlitos Burritos."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I grew up in Albuquerque, NM so it was great to find this place. I missed frito pie and green chili burgers. I haven't been to the new location but glad hey did move to a larger venue because it was always packed!"}
{"text":"a group of us went here for lunch, the food is delicious. Tastes just like home cooking. I ordered the taco salad , very large portion for the price. My two friends each enjoyed yummy beef burritos, the flavors are very good. My uncle ordered nachos, they were the best Ive ever had, very cheesy with lots of green chile. Their rice is fluffy with good flavor."}
{"text":"Burritos were ok, Tex Mex with American Flavors. Its OK for lunch"}
{"text":"The best Mexican ever. Staff are very professional and friendly. Dont leave Vegas until you eat at Carlitos."}
{"text":"This is a \"New Mexican\" restaurant. The food was meh. Probably won't return. I had the steak fajitas. It was covered in some semi spicy sauce and the veg was cooked a little too much. The flavor was ok just not for me... I did really like the green chile dip which tasted like an onion dip with green chiles. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar, nothing special...   The red sauce was very salty so we couldn't eat it but the chips were good."}
{"text":"This place makes the best burrito. You can order it with pico de gallo, cheese, and hot sauce. The steak inside the burrito makes it so delicious. The restaurant is a little ways from the strip but it is worth the drive to eat here. The inside has tv with sports and tables and chairs. It is pretty small. The burrito again is the best though."}
{"text":"HOLY MASSIVE BURRITO.

This thing was a monster.  When i got it i'm thinking something comparable to like robertos burritos.  Big but manageable. but this place holy moly hahaha I'm 6'9\" and a husky guy.  This burrito is 2 meals for me.  So if you're an average person... Expect a mexican thanksgiving meal.

I had a combo burrito with veggies and chicken in it and it was pretty good.  The staff was very friendly.  And what was refreshing is that even though i'm new they didnt give me the \"please hurry up and order attitude\" The lady was just real courteous and kind of gave me that \"let me help ya out\" mom feel.  Also ordered smothered fries (a meal in itself unknowingly) and i'll admit i like it more than Roberto's carne asada fries.  

I like this place a lot and when i want some comfort mexican food... I'm definitly going to return business here."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is AMAZING! We're from Tucson and we know authentic Mexican food, traveling around Vegas, we have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. This place is it!!!!! Great food! Margaritas are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you like New Mexico style food (which I do).  It's all about the chile and this place has got the chile right!  Red and green are both delish.  Great value too/"}
{"text":"I miss the old location!  Since they moved they changed their tacos to almost hard shell? not crunch (soggy) instead of just soft shell.  Decided to try them on 2 for 1 taco night.  LInes were stupid since they hadn't had specials for a long time.  The tacos were underwhelming very little of what used to be the best green sauce and if you wanted a second $3.50 Hamms beer you had to stand in line again.  The fact that I had been to taco Y taco recently didn't help since they have the best taco's."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place. Friends rave about it - don't understand why. Stopped in on a Saturday night around 6pm to have dinner with a friend. Ordering went smoothly although the attitude given to me by another customer when I asked if he could hand me a takeout menu (since I couldn't read the board very well & the menus were sitting directly in front of him & I didn't want to reach over him) was truly uncalled for. If your patrons are going to be that unfriendly & attitude giving I don't want to go some place like that & spend my hard earned dollar. My friend ordered up the chips & guacamole & the Carlito's Burrito while I ordered up the Legumbres (Jicama, carrots, and cucumbers tossed in red chile and lime juice) & the Navajo Taco as well as a house margarita. We sat at our table & within 5 minutes a plate was set in front of my friend & she started eating it & I commented how it was strange not to get our Starters that we ordered before the main meal item. After about 10 minutes finally they bring out the starters we ordered as well as trying to set a burrito down in front of me. I told the waitress that I didn't order a burrito but had the Navajo Taco. She turns & looks @ my friend & says it's right there & points to the plate my friend has been eating on. My friend offered to give it to me but I said no & asked the waitress to please make me another one & she rolls her eyes at me! Seriously!?! Are you kidding me? Your going to tell me to eat off a plate that someone else has eaten a good portion of the meal? It was the waitresses fault to begin with because she firmly planted it down in front of my friend & never even made mention of what it was or asked whom it should go to - she acted like she knew. I still had not gotten my margarita on the rocks with salt yet & had to mention that yet again. When I received my Navajo Taco it was 1/2 the size of the order that my friend had received (my original order). Very disappointed. It really had no taste to it. I have traveled threw New Mexico as well as camping on the Havasupai Indian grounds in AZ for several years & always get the fry bread taco when I am there - way more taste & can't get enough of them. This Navajo taco was just blah. The Guacamole was good but the chips were just so so tasting. The Lugumbres was good but not 5 star worthy. Finally when they did bring my margarita out it was missing the salt. At that point I was not going to deal with them anymore in trying to get the order right. Looking around at other patrons who ordered the house margarita they were in 16oz glasses filled to the brim while mine was a mear 10oz. Disappointed all around in service & food. I am paying the same exact price as everyone else but yet I get a smaller drink as well as 1/2 the amt of food that was originally presented. My friend made out well though as she got to eat my original order of the Navajo Taco as well as take her burrito home for a meal the next day."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall. What does that mean? It means good!!! You don't come here because you want to look at pretty walls, sit at refinished wood tables, and smile at the ambiance. 

You go out to eat to hmmmmmm, \"eat.\" I've only had the burritos here and they are GOOD! The pork is excellent, tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. The green chili sauce is a MUST!!! The burritos are HUGE and will be more than enough for the day. 

But, this is why we go to hole-in-the-wall places! We go to get large quantities of food, that tastes great, and we don't care about decor!!! 

If you don't enjoy it . . . let me help you, it's not you, it's your tastebuds . . . :)"}
{"text":"WOW! This place changed my life. I heard about it from 3 different people that share an affection for anything green chili related so I had to try - did not disappoint!! Smothered chicken burrito with green sauce OMG."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here. All the food we have had has been pretty good. Everything short of the tortillas is made on site. Had their burritos, tacos, tostada's and beer. Have always been good food and service. No free chips and salsa. But they are pretty good."}
{"text":"We Love Carlito's!! Great food, great service, great place all around. 
We feel so lucky that it is on our side of town. Because I know people who drive all across town to come eat here.  
Service Bussers waiters are on it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. We went on 8/14/16 around 11 am and were pretty excited after hearing all the good things about it. Well, we were disappointed. The chips and guacamole we ordered tasted stale and flavorless and not only did the food take forever, but the server got confused as to who had what within a three table radius. We each ordered a breakfast burrito, his was with everything, mine with bacon. Not bad at all but...the rest of the day we felt like we had rocks in our stomachs and couldn't eat again until late at night because we were nauseous all day and the next. I highly doubt we are going to go back after experiencing that.

**Update** A message from the owner stating he's sorry for not (me) being a fan. I'm okay with the snippy response, yet....Wow, he could have at least apologized for the service. Oh well, won't be going back any time soon, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Carlitos' is very authentic! I am originally born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I felt that both the green and red chile were above par and tasted very well. The pork is probably the best meat I have tasted in so long. I don't even like pork and I felt like this place could totally convert me to loving pork. I also ordered both chicken and carne asada enchiladas. I would say in this order pork, chicken, and then carne asada  ranked in best to last. The restaurant is a little bit small in space but overall if you are looking for a great new mexican food stop in!"}
{"text":"This is a \"New Mexico\" style joint.  

Pork is so unique don't waste time on carne Assada or pollo.

So good!  Pork enchiladas or tamales Christmas style (green & red sauce).  Sopapilla is great but you have to eat it fresh so desert before dinner if you take yours with honey.... Unless you get the sopapilla filled with meat.  Either way you win!

-orders take long to get, call it in.
-dine in is \"charming\", & by that I mean small.
-prices are good.

This is in my top 5 Mexican joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a breakfast burrito.  I love them here.  Sometimes I get them smothered, sometimes not.  I love the crunchy potatoes in them.

They've added Santa Maria style barbecue.  I didn't try any of that.  Note: Santa Maria style barbecue is not barbecue.  It's really a style of grilling.  It popularized the tri-tip roast.  Hopefully, we'll give it a shot on my next visit to Vegas.

Great newer location with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This is the only place in the LV area that serves chile rellenos with Anaheim chiles (not the usual Vegas poblanos). For that alone, I give them 5 stars. Now, if you wonder what the difference between chile types is...well, the anaheim is smaller, but spicier and has more flavor. Once you've had them this way, you will always be disappointed by the poblano.  The sopapillas with honey are amazing!  Beyond that, their rice and refried beans could be better."}
{"text":"I'm a born and raised New Mexican living in SoCal and every time im in Vegas I need to get my chile fix. Carlitos has always been THE (only) spot west of Gallup to get good NM cuisine. I LOVED this place at the old location, and today tried the new one. I desperately want to give this place 4 stars (back in the day it was 4 or 5 stars easily), but it seems they changed the menu and portion sizes of some items. Now they come in \"half\" or \"full\" portions, the half portion being the size of a regular one at the old location. So I ordered a bean stuffed sopapilla to go, not knowing about the changes, I was charged almost $13 for the sopapilla as the woman taking the order never mentioned there was an option for half of full. I only wanted the half (normal sized) portion. That's fine, I guess. So I got a plate with two stuffed sopas. It was pretty good- But it seems as though the food is a lot less authentic, along with the new decor. The green chile looked almost like a pale green salsa, no meaty bits of green in there at all, and it lacked heat. The red chile was ok, but not the same. It seems like they stopped using Bueno chile in their food and went for something cheaper. Also, they started adding cilantro to the onions they garnish the plates with. I asked for extra onions on mine and also got a ton of cilantro. That's Mexican, not New Mexican, and it made my food taste, well, not like the home cooking I'm used to from this place. Despite everything, my biggest gripe was the lack of ambience. The old location was full of paintings , Lobos gear, and other distinctly New Mexican decor. Now it looks pretty, well...bland. I miss the old Carlitos. I feel bad writing this because I love supporting great local places, especially my home team, but if you are looking for the same Carlitos, be forewarned."}
{"text":"Wow. I am always on the lookout for a good breakfast burrito and this fulfilled every ounce of my craving.  

When I pulled up bright and early, about 8am, the parking lot was empty.  I wasn't sure if they were open as there is no open sign and it honestly looks like they are under construction as all of the signs are temporary. I checked the door and flagged my cabby to show he could leave.  

I ordered the chorizo breakfast taco with red sauce and a Mexican Coke. Not long later I received a burrito the size of what I normally get from Chipotle and was immediately excited. After the first bite any hesitation after seeing the entrance was gone. The tortilla was toasted perfectly, not at all soggy. The chorizo was finely ground and was seasoned with great taste, as was the red chile sauce. And I believe what yielded the fifth star was the added crispy hash-browns. So good. 

Definitely make the trip."}
{"text":"New Mexican...Mexican.  All about the Green or Red chile sauces.  

Located in shopping center so parking was easy.  The artsy decor was my favorite aspect of the restaurant.  You line up, order, pay, then the food is brought to your to table.  No table service so no tips.

The veggie burrito with red sauce was good.  The red chile sauce being the star.  

The chicken tamales in green sauce were not as good.  I asked if they were made with lard.  I was told they were made with shortening.  Which I understood to be vegetable shortening.  However I am not sure.  Some people refer to lard as shortening.  In any event they were hard as rocks.  Even worse they tasted bland.  

So we were both pleased, & disappointed."}
{"text":"I drive across town to come here for a burrito smothered in their red sauce. Some of the best red chile I've ever had. I'm addicted!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try twice and both times I wasn't impressed. From the tweeker chick at the counter to the food."}
{"text":"Great food! I love the Carlitos burrito pork Verde. Always crowded though."}
{"text":"The red and green chiles here have always been my favorites. Bursts of flavor with a little kick! Love it! What I love even more is their new location! Bigger and better! Live music on the weekday I went! There's a full service bar too. 

411
-- NEW LOCATION!  Strip mall on Sunset Rd/Green Valley Pkwy, Joe's Crab Shack is your visual cue on Sunset.
-- Carlito's Burritos shares dining area space with their new bbq restaurant Live Fire Q (debuting this month)
--  Fast/Casual style restaurant  To Go or Dine In orders
 
--here's the drill--
To Go - place your orders with cashier on Carlito's Burritos side of the restaurant
Dining In - step on over to the dining area side shared with Live Fire Q and place your order with the cashier at the bar. You'll be assigned a number and you orders will be brought out to you. 

I didnt see any menu boards, so grab one of the paper menus at the register.

--Food--
-- New Mexican Cuisine
-- Portions are HUGE. Served in deep dish tin pie plates if you are dining in.
-- Prices super reasonable! Even better, you get 5% off on every purchase if you are part of the Frequent Diner Rewards Program. So sign up for it,

Lately I go for the tamales, smothered in green chile sauce and cheese! Mmmmm. Stuffed Sopapillas stuffed with tender carne adovada (NM style pork) is REALLY good too.

-- Take advantage of spending an additional $3 more for choice of 2 sides and a sopapilla! That fry bread dough is magical! Have it drizzled with honey, or sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, order it as a dessert (Sopapilla Dulce) with ice cream and chocolate sauce.

-- Breakfast is served all day! Breakfast burritos are the bomb here too! So are the meat burritos. The regular size is plenty enough. Double meat size (+$2) ones are ginormous! And dont forget to smother those too!

Oh and once their Live Fire Q restaurant is up and running, they'll be serving up Santa Maria style bbq daily. No more waiting for the weekends. 

Also new is the computerized soda fountain. It's touch screen and has many different soda drinks and options for flavors. 

--Ambiance/Service--
Feels more festive. More spacious for sure. More busy too.  But CB crew can handle it! Eileen is awesome and so is Ashley. Everyone is friendly and helpful.  

-- Summary --
Already was a fan, and this new spot they moved into made me a bigger fan. Cant wait till they fire up the grill!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new location last night (first time since they moved). We really liked the new location. Much more spacious. They've expanded the menu to include a barbecue joint, but that's not what we came for. Unfortunately, this was not the NM cuisine we had become used to in the old location. What we had was just mediocre and bland.

We may give them 6 months or so and try again (because we liked them so much in the past), but last night wasn't worth a return trip."}
{"text":"The new location is the same great food with now more room and cool place to chill and eat/ drink. Still one my favorites to eat at in Henderson. Service is awesome too."}
{"text":"Stomachs full and a smile on our faces!

We had dined here for lunch at an off time.  There were still a constant stream of people coming in during our entire stay.  The dining area is small.   I'm guessing during peak times you may want to order to go.  The line to place your order goes quickly.  There is a little wait for the food but nothing too major.  The employees are so great! They go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your meal.  

I had the shrimp combo burrito smothered.  The burrito was filled with shrimp, beans and rice covered with green chili sauce and cheese.  Really good.  When I cut the burrito in half, one whole side didn't have any shrimp.  Probably could have used more.  It was a large burrito so It filled me up anyway.  

Carlitos is certainly a place I'd like to visit again.  I'd recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Best burritos in Henderson. They are huge and full of so many different unhealthy things that it'll give a nutritionist a heart attack. Always go for more than 2 meats and get it smothered. Smothered burrito is a wet burrito with red or green chili sauce. You can taste the spices in addition to the dry chili. 

On Sunday, they have a B1G1 free breakfast burritos and they have daily specials too. On Saturday, they sell rack of ribs with their own spices. They are also great."}
{"text":"Alright, so I finally went back and it was perfect! The staff was awesome and I got the Carlito's Burrito with Carne Adovada christmas and WOW.  They really impressed me this time. The salsa, guac and chips were perfect as always.  I will be back to try your Frito Pie!!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite restaurant. We were just introduced to it and we couldn't help but come back already. The staff is friendly the prices are reasonable and the food is great! We are looking forward to coming back soon and introducing our friends to it."}
{"text":"New Mexican cuisine.  New Mexico...as in the state of.   There must be some fat folks in New Mexico...cuz the portions are outrageous!  Huge chunks of pork, tender and delicious. This food focuses on the chile.  Your choice of green or red.  I chose the green due to the promise of spice.  Not happening for me.  I am, however, jaded by my love of Thai food.  No runny nose, or stinging lips.  I could feed this to my granddaughter. They were, however, packed with great chile taste.
We tried the burrito, with adovada, Navajo taco, green chile stew, and sopapilla.  Everything we had could feed an army...so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. They have been super nice and quick to help lately. In the past they had some rude staff and I was super excited to see that they fixed that problem. However, every single time I come here they mess up the order. Both dine in and to go. Every. Single. Time. 

Most recently. five of us went to dinner. Every single order was wrong. Today we went for breakfast burritos. Even though they were labeled correctly, both of them were completely wrong. I'll eat anything, but my wife has food allergies. It sucks because we live so far away and don't want to waste another 45 minutes. I'm from New Mexico and really there isn't any other restaurant that is as good of food as Carlito's and it is going to be a long time before I consider returning."}
{"text":"We visited Carlito's based on positive Yelp reviews. The location was a storefront of a strip mall and did have some family owned charm. However, the food was nothing more than Mexican fast food. The sauces were cheap and did not appear to be freshly made. I ordered the Navajo taco and was very disappointed. It arrived in a to-go container (we were dining there) and a water-like sauce made the taco soggy. There was little spice or flavor. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here after a recommendation and it was good but not as good as I was told. It's definitely authentic New Mexican cuisine and with just a little tweaking they could make it much better. The restaurant is kind of set up in part to-go and part sit down. The food was very good but had a little too much sauce which made several dishes taste the same. There was good spice but with less sauce you could taste more of the individual flavors in each dish. The sopapillas are excellent though! I think it would be better as a QSR instead of sit down and a little quicker food service. Like I said this place has great potential they're just a little off."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving for some breakfast burritos. I ordered the breakfast burrito and the only thing that was good about it was that it was massive.

I think it should have more veggies than meat. It didn't even come with all the goods such as sour cream and onions or salsa. 

The \"smothered\" just comes with a whole bunch of green chile sauce and cheese. The taste just is overwhelming of green chile sauce. I wouldn't come back for the burrito."}
{"text":"If you are not drinking a $3 margarita, you are wasting your damn life child...

If you are reading this because you haven't tried Carlito's Burritos yet, I am hear to tell you that you are in for a treat.

They are not like to typical joints around town. They are well made and packed with bright flavor.

The staff is amazing and friendly. They will help you sort through the menu options and plan your way through a fantastic meal.

The environment is comfortable and fun. I always find myself chatting with strangers and sharing tables with first timers."}
{"text":"you know a place is good when the restaurant is in a slow plaza and theres hella cars only in front of the restaurant.  this is Carlitos.  I'm glad i found this place because it is now my favorite mexican restaurant.  very inexpensive and a big bang for your buck. 

make sure to make it a meal for only 3 bucks more.  comes with your choice of pinto, refried or black beans, rice and their bomb ass sopapilla!  make sure to drizzle that with honey.  enchiladas is my favorite so far with the pork verde.  chips, salsa, and guac is a very good appetizer.

thanks for existing! ill be back soon. very soon."}
{"text":"The enchilada plate was very good.  Pasole was nice and spicy.  Good green chile.  They also sell roasted frozen chile here when available."}
{"text":"Had the chili reanos this afternoon,(6/16/17), and they were great!!  There is no problem! They are still the best I've had in the Southwest, and I've had them all over the SW.  Keep up the  great cooking!  Thanks

We have eaten her about every three weeks--wonderful!

Ate here with friends last night (2/3/18).  The food and service were great as usual.  The chili rellenos were great!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this places food. I am a New Mexico boy myself and no one seems to be able to do it outside of New Mexico but this place is really really good I wish I could tell you more about there's I buy ever since I got stuffed sopapillas with meat and cheese I have been legit hooked the only other thing I have had is the dollar tacos on taco Tuesday which is real meat and real cheese and green chile in my case and the green chile and meat at serious serious business!!!!

My only gripe  about here is the line for taking orders is kind of clunky and awkwardly close to people sitting at there tables and squeeze between a soda machine and tables so people are squeezing by and around you which is a bubble issue I guess besides that the cashier is never entirely helpful for those who come for the first time and don't normally have New Mexican food.... But I already know what I want so I'm good lmao

The food really does make up for those awkward though... Long live Carlito's!!!!"}
{"text":"I was kind of torn with this place. :/

We went in pretty much as soon as it opened. It was a very weird set up. There was a guy at the cash register that didn't say hi... Just stood there looking very grumpy. That's when I noticed 2 signs... They basically stated that you order with the guy for to go orders and go to the other register in the dining room if you are dining in. 

As we were dining in, we walked to the other register... Mind you the entire time I was reading the signs the grumpy guy did not say one word just stood there looking at us....A little weird and a little uncomfortable. The only time is answered was when my bf asked him a direct question and it was more grunt and answer.

BUT on the other hand the lady at the register for dining in was very friendly. I was like whew... Finally a friendly face....Lol service 3/5...5 for the lady and 0 for the grumpy guy

Ambiance was ok. It was very very roomy. And I liked the decor and I loved the little tiny paw print that was in the tile on the wall behind me. So cute!!!! And it was very clean since they had just opened.  5/5

Food is where I was kind of torn. I came specifically for the Indian bread as I was craving it. I got the Indian bread taco with pork Verde. The pork was very flavorful... BUT they drenched the entire taco in the sauce for the pork which totally sogged out the entire dish. The Indian bread also was teeny tiny. Normally when you get an Indian taco the Indian bread is circular and you get the crunchy fluffy bites of the bread to eat with your meat. When I got my dish the Indian bread was hidden breathe the mountain of meat and toppings...I guess most people would like that BUT I wanted the Indian bread.... The pork was tender and flavorful don't get me wrong.... It tasted great but the Indian bread was too soggy and it was dare I say it....Too much meat!! Wow I thought I would never say that... There was just no balance between the meat and everything else ratio. :/

I do want to go again and try some of the other things but as it is kind of far from me... Don't know when that'll be."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while and Carlitos is definitely an under-rated spot in town. Gotta clarify early here for you this isn't a \"Mexican food\" place. It's \"New Mexican\" food. Green chili, fry bread tacos, etc. The owner is always there and the service is always great. The food is pretty good for the price too. I wish they made their own tortillas. That is my only gripe with their food. I usually get a burrito, but I really enjoy the nachos, Navajo taco, and their burger. Big portions also which is great.

I really wish they made their own tortillas.  If they do make their tortillas they're really just eh. Kinda just a vessel. That's like the missing piece of their burritos. It leads me to get Navajo tacos more often than not. Sometimes the meat can be a little dry, but nothing some green chili sauce can't fix. 

Overall, the service and staff takes the place from a 3 to a 4. They have some items that are delicious and some that are just ok. I would definitely check it out and see if that style of food is something for you."}
{"text":"Excellent New Mexico style cuisine !!
Inexpensive. Great service by nice
people. Great posole, green chili stew,
black beans, pinto beans, shrimp enchiladas,
specials, first-rate green chilis,  great variety. 
Eat there or take-out."}
{"text":"Love the soda options here (the horchata of course) along with my food.  Tried it after some great recommendation and was told the pork verde would be the best.  Knowing myself, I would most likely choose a terrible dish with my luck.  I did get the Carlitos burrito pork verde and knowing if I'm going to be unhealthy for once, I better get it smothered.  Wrong decision there with the smothered adovado sauce as I wasn't a fan of it.  I'm glad I did get the pork verde as the chunks of meat on this thing was huge and tender.  I ended up eating only half after my buffet at the soda machines and taking the rest home along with the smell of the place on my clothes.  I think next time, I would love to get it not smothered and to thrown in those good looking nachos I had my eyes on throughout the night of other people's orders.  Definitely a place if you want a fix on some tender meat at a decent price."}
{"text":"1st visit to this place today for lunch.  I ordered the signature \"Carlito's Burrito\" because it indicated it came with double meat and no beans or rice.  You can choose the meat and choose red or green sauce.  I chose to try chicken with red sauce.  I also ordered mine smothered ($1 additional) and with jalapenos.  The burrito was HUGE, and was packed with chicken and sauce.  I love that they covered my burrito with so much sauce that I had pools of it to use however I wanted.  For this size of burrito the price was pretty good.  I would say cheaper than most similar mexican places.  The sauce also had a good spicy kick to it.  My only complaint at all from this visit is the size of the seating areas.  It gets a little crowded as it was at lunch time and I bet it's even worse during school days with a High School right across the street.  Not a lot of room to sit, but cannot complain at all about the delicious food and the good service."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Obviously locals in the area know about it because the staff knows almost everyone by name. Tuesday's after 4p are $1 taco night but I can't get away from the chile verde smothered burrito. A mound of molten goodness. Make sure to sign up for their club to get specials."}
{"text":"Not usually one to complain, but, was half way thru my meal when I realized that they hadn't brought the margarita i had ordered. Waitress repeated the order twice so not sure why she forgot it. The place wasn't busy.  Manager did give me a free drink card for the next time we come. 

Ordered the tostadas with chicken. There was probably a table spoon of chicken in each tostada. But there was about 1/2 cup of beans in each. 

Only come because my husband likes the place."}
{"text":"After seeing many great reviews on Carlitos, I tried it. Well I won't sprang my ankles trying to run back.
I was excited because they were mad busy!! So many choices, so many flavors! Wowwww!!
That's how excited I was initally...
The burrito was huge, with red tasteless sauce poured over it and all the fixings. Definitely looked inviting, but no flavor to brag about. Ground beef was completely flavorless.
Maybe I will try something else before I completely write them off my list..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Carlito's for such a long time & I am so glad I finally did! As my husband is Native American whose family comes from New Mexico, he grew up eating NM food, which is different than Mexican food. But people don't understand that & give this place bad reviews because of their own ignorance. 

Anyway, the green chile is amazing. Haven't tried the red yet. Food was great, and there was a lot of it. My only gripe is that the fry bread & sopaipillas weren't 'all that.' My husband's grandmother knocks it out when she makes us fry bread! Comparing the food to what we had when we visited NM, it's very, very good. Santa Fe wins by mere inches though. 

They even have New Mexico chilis for sale! Connect with them on Facebook and they will post when the chilis come in and when they are roasting chilis."}
{"text":"Safe haven for vegetarians on tour to Las Vegas , excellent veggie burritos :) they were super nice in service and the lady even wrapped our take out burrito slices separately which we did not expect:). The ambience was good , the burritos had a choice of black and red beans."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! True and authentic New Mexican cuisine in the heart of Las Vegas. Excellent customer service. Great and unique drink menu. A truly excellent place for grub and drinks! 

They have a very unique drink menu, infusing the elements of chile in their menu. Love it! 

Also vegan and vegetarian friendly, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Had the pork combo burrito and it was almost devoid of any flavor other than the chile sauce. Maybe this is how New Mexico does it, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"+1 Green chile everywhere, on everything!
+1 Menu has Frito Pie and Indian Fry Bread
+1 Sunday special is BOGO breakfast burritos
+1 they serve beer and margaritas too

This place deserves a second location, it's that good... and that busy! The food is stick-to-your-ribs good, so definitely come on a cheat day. There's cheese on everything, and gigantic portions, so you're not getting out of here under a thousand calories.

Menu has a good amount of variety but my favorite is the stuffed sopapilla (pork verde please!) topped with the green chile. The Santa Fe Slider is a fairly unique offering, consisting of a slider-size burger patty folded into a tortilla and topped with green chile relish, spicy mayo, and cheese."}
{"text":"Tried a Breakfast Burrito with Green Chilie. Due to the hash brown patty in the burro, things didn't soaked up enough like it would with real potatoes. The has brown thing was too greasy in its own right. Green Chile had a kick, but eggs could have been cooked more and would have like bottle of sauce option in burrito, not just an actual Creen Chili. Perhaps you need to get it smothered for that effect? Calabicitas on the side was good, not great, but Sopadillas were a nice touch, although I should have eaten them right zway instead of waiting 15 minutes to get home. It's like getting a bagel outside NYC, you just can't recreate that New Mexico cusine outside of the city it was born into."}
{"text":"Excellent Americanized Mexican food joint. $1 beers, $3 margs and tacos that taste like real tacos. Not a bad item on the menu and everything tastes fairly authentic for being located next to a neighborhood where houses start at $1.2 million."}
{"text":"Great googly-moogly, this place is awesome.  Absolutely one of the best burrito shops on the eastside of town.

If taquerias all carry a taste of their home region, Carlito's is the New Mexico taqueria and the theme is hatch chiles.  Spicy, delicious hatch chiles.  Red ones.  Oooohh ooooh ooohh, green ones.  It's a burrito shop.  And a damn good one, but what sets it aside as one of the best in town is the chile sauces.

The green chile sauce is exceptional.  So good that you don't even need a burrito.  Their green chile stew is spicy and delicious--with well-prepared potatoes and beef.  Mmmm mmmm good.

Add in the deliciousness of a tasty burrito--pork verde, carne adovada, carne asada, chicken.  Each one delicious.  And the option to get it smothered in cheese and the previously-mentioned delicious chile sauce.

Flat out one of the best taquerias in Vegas.  A must visit for a Mexican food lover."}
{"text":"After many years of hearing about this place, I finally went yesterday.  I got the steak Carlitos burrito smothered in green sauce.  It was very good.  The sauce had sort of an olive aftertaste... But that was probably just me.  My taste has been super funky and off lately.  I think due to some medication I was taking.  So I will have to go back before I move.  Plus, I am STILL kicking myself for not getting that fry bread!!!

My friend got the sliders.  So cute!   They were wrapped in little tortillas!  Why didn't I take a pic!  Because I was too busy being fat, that's why.  ** if anyone from Carlito's is reading this:  my friend ( born and bred in NM) did say she wishes there were more green chile in her slider.  I had plenty extra green chile to share from my burrito though.  So, no problem!

They have $3 margaritas!  I know, right??? And they are yummy!   

My girlfriend buys roasted  green chile from them during their roasting season.  How awesome is that?  Saves you a trip to NM.  

I just have to add something I think is funny... Colorado peeps think the Hatch green chile is their thing.  I have so many friends from Colorado who are heartbroken when they get schooled that it is not. 

Go to Carlito's !"}
{"text":"Green chile and pork are like peanut butter and jelly. This place has the best! It's even better than my homemade carnitas. So much flavor, the pork isn't completely shredded to oblivion, it's nice and chunky. 
Navajo tacos are my favorite, just ask them to go light on the cheese. (Trust me, they use a TON of cheese)"}
{"text":"The place in kind of confusing if you have never been before.  There are 2 different areas to place your order, depending on if you are to-go or if you are dining-in.  We were dining in.  We placed our order, and the lady at the register was not friendly at all.  Maybe she was having a bad day.  All I could hope for was that the food was better than the service we were seeing.  I am happy to report that the food was terrific.  I had a pork burrito bowl.  The portion was large, and the meat was delicious.  My husband had the Navajo taco with the pork.  The fry bread was good.  It could have been a little more crispy.  We also had an order of chips and salsa which was delicious.  Overall, great food.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by today on way to the airport. About 10 minutes past McCarren but so worth the detour. A must visit if you love Santa Maria Tri-tip. The best I've ever had. 

It's this wonderful mix-up of Mexican and dry rub Q. Full bar, the kind of chips and salsa you crave later and on open kitchen where it happens. 

We had the tri-tip sandwich with comes a great slaw and beans. Huge value. But, the star is the beef and the chicken my wife had. Super moist and almost (haha) as good as my sammie! Which was packed with meat. 

Rumor has it the best breakfast burritos in town come from here so next trip I'm driving and stopping here on the way out. 

I love finding these local spots. Truly good well made fresh food. 

Nice!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say this place is amazing! Everything is authentic new mexican food. Big portions and their steaks are tender and flavorful. I come to Carlitos burritos and I'm never disappointed. Staff is great as well."}
{"text":"We used to really like this place at the old location.  We tried ordering out from new spot last night.   We ordered 4 items and 2 were wrong.   I ordered a combo burrito bowl with beef and the beef was burned to a dry, crumbly,  black inedible state. The rest of the food was just okay.   We were so disappointed. We too hope they get it back together."}
{"text":"Just delicious... It was our first time, and we ordered SO MUCH food because everything sounded delicious, and it did not disappoint... even our daughter's hotdog was amazing quality! The service was good, and they were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great New Mexico stay food. world of difference between Mexican vs southwest vs New Mexico food. Use to travel to Santa Fe, NM and this as good as you can get out side of NM. Burritos are huge and you can create any burrito you want."}
{"text":"What can I say, I get massive amounts of grief from my wife for setting my alarm clock on Sunday mornings just so I can get my Carlito's breakfast burrito fix before a day of kicking back and watching football. I have never had a bad meal here, the food speaks for itself!! My favorite thing here are the burrito's, weather its a breakfast or pork chili burro, its second to none other."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place you must. The food is unique and very delicious. The place is New Mexico style. I am pretty sure the owner is from Albuquerque."}
{"text":"Food was not up to par. First time I have ever ordered huevos rancheros and it may has well been eggs and chilli.  There were no beans, it did not come on flour or corn tortilla, they put that on the side.  The posole was over powered by the oregano and the carne adavoda taco was dry and disgusting.  Finally it's is not customer friendly and not centrally located.  The previous one on Pecos was better.  Just goes to show that bigger is not always better #saveyourmoney"}
{"text":"Return customer good food but bad customer service the cashier is rude about disabilities. Not sure how I feel about this place now."}
{"text":"We went and tried out the new location - taking some new folks with us after raving about Carlitos.  I'm sad to say, we were let down :(  I miss the old restaurant and family atmosphere.  I ordered what I normally order, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and the enchiladas were baked on to the bottom of the new pans they use (they used to be in aluminum to go containers that were  deeper and filled to the brim with goodness), there wasn't enough sauce (it's like the didn't adjust their portions to the new pans) and it was just plain dry all around.   It also felt like a smaller portion, but maybe it was just the larger pan, I don't know.  The service kind of sucked too.  The bartender had to ring us up and he was nice, but had no idea what was going on.  The girl next to him (that was on the other cash register), knew how to help him but  would huff and roll her eyes every time he asked her something.  She saw I had a squirmy toddler, but it didn't occur to her that it would be nice if she would help the poor guy out and get my order quicker.  She should realize that her attitude to him transferred on to our general service experience.  It's like she was rolling her eyes directly at me. It made me want to punch the wall, honestly.  The space is large, cold and oddly laid out.  They should just merge both take out and restaurant sides - it's confusing otherwise and they can use the staff on both sides to help.  I really hope it's better next time we go because this is the only decent place for NM food and I can't help but crave a sopapilla every now and then.  Please fix it and bring back the old vibes and food!!!"}
{"text":"Fry bread convert!

I've been looking for some heat outside of Asian food. The stuffed sopapillas and Navajo taco definitely satisfied this craving. It wasn't as spicy as I had imagined but it was enough heat that you didn't have burning sensations when the food came out the other hole. As for meat, I think their pork verde is cooked perfectly. On the other hand, their chicken is not so great. I believe it was all dark meat and it didn't go well with the sopapilla because it made the dish heavier than it already was. If they had a white meat option, I'd definitely go for that! Lastly, we tried their chicken tamale and forgot to get it \"sauced.\" It came with a salsa and green sauce but it wasn't enough to help this plain tasting tamale. On the upside, the chicken was white meat. 

I'm definitely a fan of Carlito's and will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice in the last month. The first time I ordered the chicken taquitos this time I ordered the tri tip plate. Both meals have been good, nothing to amazing but for the price it's well worth it. I felt that they both needed a bit more of a kick to them. They tri tip and chicken both lacked in seasoning a little. Over all I will be back to try more items on the menu and I'll continue taking guests here when they visit Nevada."}
{"text":"I got my degree in Culinary Arts in Santa Fe, NM needless to say I have chile running through my veins. Every now and then I just need my chile \"fix\" Carlitos never disappoints on nurturing my spicy comfort food demand. Both the red and green chile are delicious. They now have a BBQ section to try... the Trifecta with green chile is my suggestion to you. But you can never go wrong with their frito pies or breakfast burritos. I really appreciate they do a frequent diners club, trust me it pays off! Do  yourself a favor and head over for spicy southwestern comfort food the owner is from Los Alamos so we are talking authenticity here folks. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the counter service is sometimes slow. But trust me the food and sangria/margaritas are worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my husbands mechanic, let me say this place was amazing. Ample seating,  serves liquor. My husband had the stuffed chicken sopapilla, I had the pork verde burrito smothered in green sauce.  OMG flavor was amazing,  every bite kept getting better.  For $3 more you can have a side of rice,  beans,  salad, or pozole there was an additional cost for pork pozole for. 65 on top on the $3 let me tell you I will never step foot in La Bonita again to get my pozole, flavor was incredible. It also comes with a sopapilla on the side,  we couldn't even finish the food we took it home. The staff was very friendly. I wanted to kiss the cook for doing a amazing job.  We will definitely be back and spread the word of  this amazing restaurant!!"}
{"text":"A little taste of home! In New Mexico there are burrito drive thru joints that have a very distinct home cooked NM flavor. I never thought I'd find that flavor in Las Vegas. I am beyond excited! 

I had no idea this place existed. I was reading The View and came across an ad/coupon, so we went on a Sunday morning. To our surprise, every Sunday is BOGO burrito day! I opted for the breakfast burrito with green chili (of course!) and ham; my boyfriend did the same with chorizo. So very delicious. Chorizo has a kick, so keep that in mind. Grabbed a to go menu and am beyond ecstatic that they have stuffed sopapillas!!!! Oh and freshly made margaritas is also on my next visit list! Cannot wait to return!

Sunday was busy but the staff (owners..?) were SO friendly and welcoming. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our to go order, but it was worth every minute.

What are you waiting for? Go check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"We dropped by for dinner around 6pm on a Sunday night. There were a few other customers, but not super busy.

We ordered a burrito and a stuffed sopapilla. Both were generously sized, good tasting and reasonably priced. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable.

Definitely a nice place to get some tasty grub!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Service is not good. Food is okay at best that's why I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1. I won't be back I would rather go somewhere else. 

I went in to order there was 3 people standing no one greeted me just pointed to the left so I can order on the other side. Next time say hello thanks for coming please order on the other side. Don't just point!"}
{"text":"Went in to try the huevos rancheros for breakfast.  The place is a little awkward, the dish, while featuring what seemed like authentic New Mexican green chile, was also kind of awkward...no tortilla under the eggs, eggs overcooked (over easy isn't supposed to be over hard), not enough chile.  It wasn't entirely terrible, but it wasn't very good either.  Probably won't give this place another look."}
{"text":"Food to value is not really here. Quality is ok but I got the Huevos rancheros. They give two small flour tortillas and a large plate of eggs and hash browns. Not really worth the higher price they charge. I was really hoping to find a place that serves mole dishes not just a higher priced taco shop with fancier plates and bigger seating space."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burrito with no meat add grilled veggies avocado and this is the most basic burrito I ever had. so bland, don't be fooled by the reviews. I'm highly disappointed, their child relleno was good."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here since I moved to Vegas but I'm rarely on this side of town so when I was I went there early on a Thursday morning. 

When I walked in I knew I was in for a treat. You can smell the Green Chile and it smells like I've walked into a real New Mexican restaurant back home. 

I ordered a Green Chile bacon breakfast burrito. I was not dissapointed this is a legitimate New Mexican restaurant and I felt like I was eating a Twisters burrito back in Albuquerque. 

The burrito was large and loaded up with plenty of bacon, egg, potato, and green chile. 

I would love to sit down and be able to try a little of everything here. There is no place in Vegas to compare to because New Mexican cooking is completely differrent then a typical Mexican restaurant but it is better then any other place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love carlitos burritos. I'm a huge green Chile fan having been raised in Colorado so I have been searching for a reasonable substitute in las Vegas for years. 

the green Chile stew is awesome with an added dash of salt on some occasions but usually very good. my very favorite is a stuffed sopapilla filled with the pork verde and then smothered in green Chile-so good! I can eat two, easy.

burritos are much better than a robertos burrito, especially the breakfast burritos. the fun nights to go in are when something special is cooking, anywhere from pizzas with green Chile to different sandwiches or special cuts of meat, sometimes on the grill out front. the kids are happy eating quesadillas or tacos. mom is happy with a margarita, which are very good by the way. 

one of my favorite places to go in las Vegas and Im sure our children grow up with fond memories of eating here the way I remember different foods from my childhood."}
{"text":"Food was quite good. New location is HUGE compared to the previous spot. They haven't quite mastered dealing with a large number of people at once.. a bit chaotic when a bus load of tourists arrived.  Had the chili rellenos and they were yummy one green one red! Ole!"}
{"text":"Good burritos, tacos and their Frito pie is good. The portions are large, I've never been able to finish it in one sitting. Their counter people are really nice and helpful and the have a reward program, just give them your name and number they will give you a discount right then. Give them a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is not a place you would just stumble upon. Thanks yelp!

I had the green chili enchilada with a side of rice. This is true New Mexican. The best I've had outside of NM."}
{"text":"I thought again about our visit and you are right Dave - 5 stars is what it was. Service was right up there with the perfectly cooked food!"}
{"text":"Great food!  New Mexico style Mexican food made with Hatch Green Chile...this place does it right!  What a great place to have in LV.  Small dining area and a little out of the way but well worth the trip.  Try the Green Chile Stew."}
{"text":"Seating is tight and expect to wait when it's busy. Order at the counter. Each time I've gone the person there is not very nice. I've tried the chicken enchiladas and sopapilla. Both were more spicy than flavorful. The portions are generous enough. The chips are a stale-like texture covered in some spice powder. On the upside there is beer and sometimes men will be there serenading right into your ear with their guitars. With barely enough room how could they not? I feel bad to say it, but I rather go to Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Pros-Awesome food and friendly staff.
Cons-you have to pay for \"extras\": chips,salsa,etc, which are usually standard parts of your entree. So basically everything is ALA CARTE,"}
{"text":"thanks to Groupon's $6 for $12 coupon I probably wouldn't know about this place. My first expeirence with New Mexican food so didn't know what to expect. Similar menu as your typical Mexican restuarant and a few of their own. 

Had the Steak Carlito's Burrito (pic) which i really liked for $7.60 with all of it's 8 complimentary add-ons, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, salsa, and so on. guacamole and sour cream was extra. it was loaded with tasty chunks of steak, i could definitely taste a difference in the spices and seasoning. they also have a veggie burrito for $4.60 that you can mixup all kind of beans and rice together, or the combo burrito for around $6-7 which is the veggie and meat.

Total wasn't $12 yet so I added the Pork  Nachos for also $7.60.  They weren't that bad, had a bunch of ingredients that resembled those layered nachos dips what I usually eat while watching football. beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, peppers, guacomole, and sour cream and some large pork pieces. didn't care for their chips, shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly.

They have a good nightly special from 4-9pm.
Mondays - Santa Fe Sliders for $1
Tuesdays -Beef Tacos for $1
Wednesday - HUMP DAY - 1/2 off breakfast burrito till 11 am and $6 pizzas.
Thurdays - Bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6.50.
Friday - Chicken, steak, and shrimp fajitas from $6-8.
Saturaday - Ribs for $8.95
Sunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day.

they also serve beers, margaritas, and wine so that's cool.

they were busy during lunch, they had tables and a few bar counters to eat at. also like all of their pictures and their open view of the kitchen."}
{"text":"\"New Mexico\" food, so there's a heavy influance of red and green chili dishes. Burritos and Burrito Bowls are about $6. They have a double-meat, sans beans and everything else, burrito that is ok for carb watchers. If you get it in a bowl, it will be meat soaked in your choice of green or red chili. 

My friend got a Frito's Pie dish, which about $5 and was packed with food (fritos, ground beef, lettuce, and alot of cheese, plus sauce.

I would eat there again for lunch since it's near my office, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Try the breakfast burrito smothered with green chili, the best!  All meals are excellent!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, everything they have is great, large portions and whatever you get, get it smothered. And don't forget the sopapilla with honey."}
{"text":"I was desperately looking for a good breakfast burrito on a Sunday morning, I started yelping on my phone and came across Carlito's. On Sundays they have 2 for 1 breakfast burritos which is so unheard of. I ordered the ham breakfast burrito with extra ham and a carne asada burrito. The ham was GREAT! This one on its own gets 4 stars! The carne asada however was an epic fail! With carne asada being a staple it is suppose to shine in its own way, and if you can't get it right in a burrito there is no hope LOL! This burrito gets a one star because of the taste and because I got food poisoning! 

I wouldn't come back here, these kind of places are a hit and mess and I haven't been overwhelmed with the few that I have tried but doesn't matter since I'm on my way out of this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have to preface this review by saying this is NOT Mexican food. It's New Mexican food, therefore it's American. Now, that being said, I LOVE this place! The food of New Mexico is so unique and different. The Navajo fry bread stuffed with  pork Adobada is incredible, and I get it almost everytime I go. The fries smothered with the green chiles and cheese are sooo good, still crispy and just perfect. It's always a tough decision on what to get because everything is great. The diable burrito is stuffed to the gills with huge shrimp, and their rice and beans are totally different than any kind you  can get anywhere else. I found the green chile to be spicier, and the red chile to be more earthier and smoky. If you can't decide, get them both in a version known as Christmas style, both red and green. And to top it all off, they even have their own signature beers for $1 a pint! It's a cool little hole-in-the-wall place with neat art from New Mexico, and you can buiy the chilies to go, either dried of made into their sauce. If you've never had the food of New Mexico, then this is the place for you to try some of their tasty food and experience their culture. I highly recommend it, and have never had a bad experience there. When I move, I'm gonna miss this place because I'm fairly sure there is no food like this available near Tampa. I LOVE Carlito's!! Vaya con Dios Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Awesome green chili New Mexico style. The breakfast burritos are excellent! They have great deals on Sunday. It was $19 for 4 of us, and we are stuffed and happy! Great great place"}
{"text":"The short:  Absolutely AMAZING!  Go try it NOW!

The long: 

Carlito's Burritos is easily my new favorite place to eat.  Not just my new favorite New Mexican place to eat.  I cannot believe I waited so long to try this wonderful place, and now all the buzz and reviews make sense.  

I placed a to go order with a friend.  We ordered a combo burrito and tacos.  The burrito was absolutely gigantic.  And when they \"smother\" a burrito, they really mean \"drown\" it - but in the best way possible (if there is a good way to drown something, I mean).  It was packed with meat and all the \"fixins.\"  The tacos were absolutely to die for.  They are crispy but not greasy.  The steak was amazing; perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  They were topped with the freshest and most delicious lettuce and tomatoes I have had from a restaurant.  Straight from the garden ya'll.

We ordered a few sides, too.  The refried beans are killer; they are not smashing smooth, they have a really nice texture and amazing flavor.  The rice wasn't great, but I'm not holding that against them.  Just not my type of flavor.  The green chile stew was super yummy, but very spicy.  

The yelp 5 star rating says it all: \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"Wow! I found this place on yelp. Usually when I land in vegas I head to a pretty popular taco y taco joint for a burrito. But today Carlito's pops up on yelp. I head over and I'm greeted by a very cheerful young lady who takes my order. Food arrives quickly and I'm dying in burrito heaven. Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great burritos and smothered fries! The meat is on point and their salsa is MUY SABROSO!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch and breakfast here on a 13 day trip to Vegas.  Would've came more often if I'd found it earlier.

Lunch was carne Asada and chorizo burrito smothered Christmas style, with a side of green chile stew and a $1 draft beer (yes, really $1).   Burrito was great, but be prepared for HEAT, esp with the green chile.  Beer was icy cold.

Breakfast was an \"everything\" breakfast burrito with red chile sauce inside, way less heat and also delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always amazing. Super fast service as well!! I love it !"}
{"text":"New Mexican food. With all do respect, not for me. I like real Mexican food. The food here is bland. We went on a Saturday night with the kids and did not like the environment. Too many drunks. Staff was nice! First and last for me."}
{"text":"Great food try to get there several times a month.  Today the navaho taco was 1/2 the usual size"}
{"text":"I ordered the Navajo taco with green chile and I was disappointed it was way to soggy and just turned to mush YUCK!! After looking at the pics people have posted I might give this place one more try since the nachos look really good."}
{"text":"I am a professional chef and I enjoyed the food. I love chili rellenos and theirs were great with the smothered green chili's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden gems .... The food is good quality and never disappoints everything is good ...  whatever you go with add clabasitas and green chile !!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Carlitos!  I first tried Carlito's about 6 years ago when a coworker would bring me their breakfast burritos.  They are so good and huge!  I was hooked.  I love anything green chile so the whole menu is a hit with me but my absolute favorite is the BBQ they do on the weekends.  In the cooler months they fire up the grill a couple Saturdays a month.  Tri tip, ribs, chicken and prime rib are a few of their offerings.  They do one meat a day.  You can get it  as an entree with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas or as a sandwich with cheddar cheese and green chile on garlic bread.  OMG.  It is so good.  They sell out fast so if you can't make early it is best to order in advance.  Ordering in advance will save your food but they don't make it until you get there.  I recommend calling when you are on your way so it will be ready.  I learned that the hard way when we ordered a nacho bar and a few racks of ribs for fight night.  I ordered in advance and stated a pickup time but had to wait almost an hour when we got there for the food.   I wasn't expecting the wait but they were slammed.  I can appreciate they want their customers to have the best product possible and didn't make it early to just sit there.  The recently announced that they are moving to the Galaxy Theater complex and in addition to Carlito's they are opening a Santa Maria BBQ spot Live Fire Q!  Now I can get their BBQ whenever I want!  No more waiting for Saturdays or worrying about sell outs.  No firm date yet but they are shooting for October.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Fantastic New Mexican food!! Super friendly helpful and cheerful lady at the register made our lunch amazing!!! Could not recommend this more.  

Stuffed sopapillas are to die for!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my family split in two. Kinda.

I took our daughter to Disney on Ice (Princess edition) & my husband took our son rock climbing. They ended up at Nevada climbing centers so after the sweet princess show was over, we met them at NCC. We contemplated for a whole 2 minutes what to eat when Carlito's Burritos popped up on my nearby restaurants! I've had this place bookmarked for a couple of weeks and was super excited to be close.

We get into Carlitos. It is small, yet cozy. The walls are painted bright and there are pictures and decor everywhere. The lady who took our order was SO sweet. She kept complimenting my children and was very thorough when taking our order considering it was our first time. I ended up getting the chicken nachos with green chilli and jalapenos on the side where my husband got the spicy pork smothered in green chilli and cheese. Our food came out shortly after and we dug in. I shared my nachos with my kids because they were so large, but as soon as the food was brought to us, and I touched the top layer of cheese, I noticed it was cold....

As I begin spooning out portions of nachos to my children, I notice that the cheese underneath the top broiled layer wasn't melted. My son who usually has the appetite of a teenager, especially for nachos, didn't want to finish his share and neither did my daughter (although she's pretty unreliable when it comes to eating anyway). I still ate my cold nachos because I felt bad after taking so much out of it, to be sending it back. I should have stopped when my stomach was telling me that it wasn't jiving. On the other hand, my husband's burrito was DELICIOUS. It was so warm and smothered that it made me resent my nachos even more. Every bite of his cozy burrito made my nachos seem even colder. The green chilli isn't too spicy, but it sure is tasty!! In the end, I wasn't able to finish my nachos, even when sharing with my children. I can easily finish a tray of Roberto's nachos single handedly, and then some, just to give you an idea of the size. 

Later that night and the next day, my stomach wasn't the same. It churned all night and was the saddest tummy ever. I really really hope the chicken was fully cooked before it was thrown into the broiler to not get warm at all, but I'm not certain.... Sadly, because of this experience, I won't be back. My stomach will never forgive me if I return."}
{"text":"God I love this place! Cannot find a good shrimp burrito anywhere. They have them here though and a great price really flavorfulwith great service"}
{"text":"Food is good, nothing wowing! Total hype place. They nickel and dime you for everything. Service is pretty non existent and the bathrooms are filthy. Menu is misleading and again charge you for everything. I am surprised they don't charge for salt, pepper, napkins or a seat charge. If i would not go out of my way to come here, I happen to be taking a class in the plaza and have an hour lunch. Don't waste your time on his filthy pit. It's 12:30 in the afternoon and the place is empty."}
{"text":"I love his place so much I always get there breakfast burrito with chorizo and green sauce. 
Sunday they are 2 for1!  There Santa fe sliders are also the bomb."}
{"text":"It's been 30 minutes still waiting for my pozole that I ordered feeling annoyed right about now"}
{"text":"So I been thinking about a good Navajo Taco. I did not get that at Carlito's. I did get a great Chili verde and  Adovado chili. They are lacking in the execution of the fried bread.
It did not look like anything I have seen the Navajo's make. It was not fried to its beautiful crispness. It was like a pillow of soft dough. I wanted some texture contrast to the soft spicy compliment of chili. The service was good and the place was clean. The menu is small and sometimes thats a good thing. I am on the fence on if its worth a trip back.
I am more like a 2 1/2 stars. to the owners and chefs check out any You tube video of Navajo taco's and see if I am wrong about what you are selling."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great green chile and the fry bread is just too yummy. Check out their weekday specials and also the Saturday tri tip or ribs they have during the day. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I'm originally from NM and this place is just like eating back home. Everything I've tried is amazing. My favorite is the Carne Adovada stuffed sopapilla. Try this place and you'll just keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place has quickly won my heart.  Not easy to do so...ask the ladies. Haha! I've been here a couple times.  I was looking to get a quesadilla.  Never in my life did I think I would be having one of the best steak quesadillas I would ever taste.  Absolutely delicious and flavorful.  Meat was tender and very well spiced.  

On my second visit, I know I needed one of those again, but i decided to add some tacos to the mix.  Couldn't believe how good those shrimp tacos are!! I'm mad as I'm typing this, since I can't just reach over and have another bite! Finished them in record speed! Love the fresh garnishes they throw on top of the tacos, even the corn taco tastes very homemade.  I really enjoy the vibe of this restaurant.  The workers are very cool and laid back, the families that are sitting around you seem very happy with their meals, and the workers do their best to interact with everyone.  Really can't ask for more from an establishment.

They will know me by name soon...thats how frequent I will be visiting this place."}
{"text":"Mmmm, mmmm good!! Thanks fellow yelpers, this was a great find! Burrito, taco, tamale, chips and salsa - all excellent!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Burritos, tacos, enchiladas, BBQ and everything else! The spice from NM is great!  Chip and quac is amazing along with the salsa. The vegetable mix (calabacitas) is always great! The smothered green chili burrito is amazing, and be warned you might have a few heads of sweat drip down your forehead from the heat!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great place for lunch, try Carlito's Burritos!  During the week it gets busy but not over crowded.  Good food and you can even meet clients here- not too loud and the tables are spaced out nicely.  They have a bar area as well as table seating; with a few TVs around.

I love the shrimp enchiladas in green sauce!  Definitely a place to repeat!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed by coming here. 4 stars on yelp and google, definitely a mistake. Walking in you have to go around the corner and order while a line forms behind you. $31 dollars for 2 drinks, ugly tacos, a bland salad and burrito was not worth it. The soda machine was nasty, ice every where and sticky. My fathers tacos looked terribly sad and were bland. I got the ensalada with chicken. The dressing had no flavor, just hot, i had to salt it twice. As for the chicken there was maybe 20 flecks, not peices or chunks of chicken. My brother asked for black beans and got pinto beans in his burrito. His red sauce also had no flavor, just hot. The cliental is obvious with looking at the surrounding area, they obviously have pallets like ally cats. We will definitely not be coming back here"}
{"text":"Came to Carlitos for the first time last night. I ordered the Thursday night special \"green Chile hamburger and fries\".  Wow! I really enjoyed it. The green Chile had so much flavor! Wrapped it up with a couple of really delicious sopapillas.  Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Another bookmark. Check. Based on my rule of thumb, I usually get the namesake because it should be a safe pick right?

So I get the Carlito's Burrito. Peep this. Double meat (no rice or beans). Your choice of meat. (Beef, Chicken, Chorizo, Carne Adovada, or Pork Verde for 7.35) Steak is 8.35 and Shrimp is 8.95.

You can choose to smother it enchilada style for a dollar more. You can add complimentary toppings upon request. (Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Cilantro, Salsa, Pico De Gallo, Pickled Jalepenos, and Serrano Peppers)

Guacamole is 75 cents and Sour Cream is 50 cents.

I chose steak with everything except for the Guacamole and Sour Cream. They ask you if you want the red or green sauce. They told me the green sauce was more spicy so I got the red. (I still ended up sweating profusely so I am assuming the green must be really spicy)

The taste? Pretty good! You have chunks of steak mixed with all the fixins. Every bite was as good as the last. If you refer to my pic, the size of the thing can be intimidating. But if you are really hungry you should be able to finish it.

Service was decent. You order, pay, wait, and receive your food. Enjoy. Keep in mind since they only have one register, on really busy days you just might wait a while.

Location. Ummm, its a decent sized place for where its at. From the outside it looks small, but when you come in, there are enough tables and chairs for about 20 people.

So next time, I will try other some of the other tasty options since the Carlito's Burrito was so good."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is the only place I can eat NEW MEXICAN food! Delicious!! Highly recommended if u want sum green chile!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall type of restaurant. Very small. I think it's pretty authentic when it comes to mexican food. It is family owned so when you come in the faces are usually the same and they very warm & welcoming. 

I usually get the Green Chili Stew which is by far my favorite from the menu. It's pretty spicy, has an extreme kick to it. If your palette can't handle spiciness, I wouldn't recommend this stew. The portions are pretty good size. I've ordered chicken nachos here before and boy were they good and I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself.

The Sopapillas are delish as well. I usually just get it regular without any add ones. They bring out honey to put on it. Oh my gosh, it is so warm fluffy. yum!

They have $3 margaritas everyday so that's a plus. Prices are reasonable. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"5 star on tri tip. Nice crispy crust, served med rare super tender. 
4 star on bone in chicken breasy good flavor very moist great chicken
 Chips are good  SALSA is terrible.  Even a mammaluke woukd understand they  have all the resources to make insanely amazing salsa.  
Here is a tip get a few tomatoes an onion a Jalepeno throw it on your open wood fire grill char them up and blend with a little salt.. elaborate from here. 

You would have amazing salsa. Canned tasting garbage is a disgrace to a place turning out such great bbq..
Pick up your SALSA game,  that is pathetic.  
Also bartender never asked for water or beer refill and I was sitting 24 inches away from her the entire meal. 
I feel bad giving so little stars to a great place but I will change my review if you step up your SALSA game.  Also I will be back for more tri tip and chicken.  Also I've had the sausage sandwich before which is terrific."}
{"text":"Sunday they have 2 for 1 Breakfast Burrito's that are Outrageous!
$1 Drafts are always appreciated
And Da Nachos are Fantastic
FYI... Green Pork is the Best"}
{"text":"The only authentic New Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas I have come across.Those of you from New Mexico and miss the food,look no further.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the place is run down and the bathroom is always filthy."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, considering that I have given a 5 star and 4 star review  to the place next door, which is supposedly owned by the same people. I ordered a smothered burrito with pork verde and the green sauce burned the outside of my mouth for a good half-hour and not in a good way, I also really enjoy spicy foods. The pork was flavorless and hard sometimes. I've also had a salad here,  which I'm not sure is part of Live Fire  Q or Carlito's Burritos, but it was not good. the salad was chopped up and I felt like I was eating coleslaw instead of an actual salad, it too lacked. I will however stick with the tri tip from the other side as it is always excellent."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Since our family is from New Mexico and the best chile comes from New Mexico (yes I said it) :).  It's flavorful and spicy. 

Had a wedding in Vegas and needed food catered and Dave provided great customer service, very accommodating and provided great food for our special occasion. Very reasonably priced. All our guests raved about the food. We had green and red cheese enchiladas, green and red chicken & cheese enchiladas, chile verde, chile rojo both with pork, rice, beans, chips green and red salsas. All the food was just like home cooking.  

I have to say I was really nervous about ordering food long distance and having never tried it, but with all the great Yelp reviews I felt more comfortable.

Next time in Vegas we will definitely stop by and eat here. Thank you Dave!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken nachos are MASSIVE!!  At 6'5\", I'm a big eater and I can't finish them.  Affordable for the portion size too.  The chicken is delicious and the chips are made fresh.  I've had their tacos and they don't disappoint either, but these nachos are the best in the city, hands down.  And I've eaten a lot of nachos.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Las Cruces New Mexico.  This is not Mexican food.  I know what you are saying.  \"But, Ernesto the sign says Carlito's Burritos, it's gotta be Mexican food.\"  No, sir this is New Mexican cuisine, and this is how we roll!  All you Cali people can take your tacos and tapatio hot sauce somewhere else.  

We learned about this place from a friend who is also from New Mexico about a year ago and I almost started crying when I ordered food in Las Vegas with real hatch green chile.  This is my comfort food spot.  Every time I get a little home sick I know I can count on Dave and his staff to cook up some excellent food straight from the recipe book of Nuevo Mexico!  

My recommendation if you have never feasted on genuine New Mexican food is to try out the stuffed sopapillas.  This is something you don't see done in California and they are awesome.  This place also has some daily specials.  I am personally a fan of green chile more so than red chile.  My mom makes the best red chile so it's hard to compare to other places.  Also don't be a sissy when you eat here.  We like our green chile and we like it hot.  spicy food is alway the best food anyway.  I can go on an on about Carlitos and I can even try to explain what New Mexican food is but I can't.  You just need to try it to see why your life has been incomplete before eating something spectacular from a cool state!  Cheers! and speaking of cheers they have $1 draft beers too!"}
{"text":"A local's hole in the wall but you don't come to Carlito's for the ambiance.   You come for the food and the $1 drafts / $3 marguaritas.   If you're gonna complain about the seating and lines, stay away.  We come here for the great food and drink at reasonable prices.   A real gem for Mexican in LV."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco and visit Vegas a few times a year on work and every time I go I do WHATEVER IT TAKES to make it out to Carlitio's. They have hands down, the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life. It's the size of a super burrito at most places and full of the freshest and tastiest ingredients you could ask for. The employee's are all super upbeat and friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. My only complaint... all 5 times that I've been now, I've had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. I'd love to see these guys move to a location just a tad bit bigger, it would really go a long way."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this spot not to long ago. It was really good! I had the Carlitos Shrimp Burrito and payed the extra $1 to make it wet with cheese on top. The price is very reasonable too. The staff behind the bar was friendly and it looks like they had some mixed drinks and beer available. The reason for the 4 and not 5 is the size of the place. It felt very very cramped. Also I plan on going back and and trying other items so if they are just as good ill raise it because then the size of the place won't matter."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother because I had a coupon that was about to expire. The place is pretty small, but there are lots of places to sit. My brother ordered a pork combo burrito ($5.75) and a pint of beer ($1). I ordered a chicken ensalada ($6.95). The burrito came wrapped in foil. It was so huge it looked like it was going to explode in my brother's face. He took his first bite and said, \"*%#! yeah, this is dank!\" Translated into normal English, that means it was delicious. He was also very pleased about being able to get a pint of beer for a buck. That's a pretty sweet deal and I think it's all day everyday. My ensalada wasn't what I expected. I was expecting it to be a salad in a tostada BOWL, but it was actually a big salad on top of a flat tostada in a foil bowl. All the juices of the huge salad made the little tostada all soggy on the bottom, so I didn't eat it. The salad itself was good though, I was just expecting to get it in a crunchy tostada bowl that I could tear apart and turn into chips. Even though I wasn't too fond of my salad, I am still a fan of this place. My brother loved his burrito, they have lots of specials, and the prices are cheap!

{"text":"Carlitos burritos has a neighborhood taco shack feel to it.  You order at the counter and service is friendly.  They serve homemade tamales, and serve the traditional fare - burritos, tacos, quesadillas - all with the typical options of pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, or veggies. 

Portions are beyond generous and the prices are good, real good.  A couple can stuff themselves for around $10.  However, while portions were huge, flavor was not.  We found both our meals \"good enough\" but relatively bland.  I tried the chicken tamales, smothered in green sauce.  I found the sauce a bit goopy, and generally lacking in taste (something no chile verde sauce should have a problem with in the southwest where we have easy access to freshly roasted chiles).  The sauce had heat, but lacked any flavor complexities beyond that.  The tamales were fine - but again, not mind blowing, a bit lacking on the flavor.  We also ordered nachos and a burrito.  The nacho portion was HUGE!  If you're with a group of friends and want an appetizer doused in cheese, and sour cream (which definitely has it's place in the diet every now and then) this is the place to go.  However, besides the entire brick of cheese melted on top, other flavors were lacking - the beans were sparse, and we just felt a bit overdone by the time the dish was halfway consumed. 

However, the bright spot was $1 pints of MGD!  Can't beat that price! 

In summary, Carlitos is a nice little neighborhood joint that would be a great place to meet friends for some beer, cheesy chips, and some cheap Mexican food.  However, we were generally underwhelmed by the (lack of) flavors in our meals.  This was our first trip there, so I'd be willing to give it another go (the cheap beer will bring me back)."}
{"text":"I am a burrito enthusiast and this one takes the cake! Their southwest style twist that they put on all of their food is absolutely amazing! The owner David is directly from the Southwest and brought his style with him! They also do catering so no matter what you're looking for you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Flavor was good, food was cold. Not only did they mess up my order, but never processed my son's. Had to re-order his nachos which were processed in line with everyone who came in after us. After sitting at the table for 5 min with our food his was finally delivered. Cheese wasn't even pull apart stringy like fresh nachos should be. Husband said it was like they had a time machine- they knew what you were going to order and then put it in the fridge for you to keep it fresh. 

Don't think we'll be back. Shame too... Dining room was nice and food has potential. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"OK the food rates 5 stars but this is just a very small strip-mall joint, with a little more space it would be 5-star. I was taken there by a good friend for lunch who lived in New Mexico and offered that this is typical NM fare. I tried the Navajo Taco as suggested, and it was great. Mine was with the Pork Verde, the \"taco\" is Indian Fry-Bread and it was a sort of a tostada - but on steroids. The service was fast and friendly. The place was packed - with a line out to the door by 1pm. So if you are having lunch get there early. Aclear indication that this is the real-deal. If you are looking for something a bit different than the usual Mexican, Tex-Mex grub, this is the go-to place. You will not be disappointed. Not to mention that the cost is reasonable. I plan to go back often."}
{"text":"Loved their stuffed sopapillas! Red chile and green! Every time we have eaten here we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"How this place has been here without me knowing about it seems somewhat impossible! I love Mexican food, I love green chilies, and they have Indian fry bread tacos?!?! Ok, so the fry bread is called the \"Navajo\" taco and to me isn't even their best attribute. 
The best thing about this place? THEY SERVE 3 ENCHILADAS INSTEAD OF 2!!! Maybe that's not a big deal to you, but 2 cheese enchiladas is just almost enough, every time! Also, you can choose green or red sauce with everything, EVEN SALSAS! Which you should splurge and get the extra chips, salsas, and house mad guac. 
I think they only have one location, and it is for sure a family operation. I have always seen regulars when I go, and been treated like I am one. I have yet to actually try a burrito, but between the tacos and enchiladas, I am always happy. I have dined in as well as gotten take out orders and never once been disappointed. 
This place could expand and I hope if they do, they keep everything the same. No need to change what is already great."}
{"text":"An offbeat location, but yummy food! We had the chips, salsa and guac, steak tacos and sugar sopapillas. Yes. They have sopapillas! Regular and sweet ones. They're larger than my hand, too! 

Meat was tender. Green and red salsa were delish! Great portions. Taco shop style seating. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's NEW Mexican as in New Mexico (the state) food. A lot of times I see it grouped as Mexican or Tex-Mex but that's not the case. Chile and fry bread here and it's delicious! I could sit down with just a bowl of green chile and some tortillas or fry bread and go to town. It's always busy but the staff is friendly and helpful and the praise they get it well-earned and deserved. My strategy is to save half of what I get and eat my whole sopapilla which is a must."}
{"text":"Maybe New Mexican food just isn't my thing but I don't see how anyone could enjoy it.  

I went into Carlito's optimistically, as the aroma of delicious food was seeping outside into the parking lot.  I ordered a chicken Carlito's burrito with green chili sauce, no tortilla, no cheese, and plenty of delicious fixings.  

When I arrived back to my office, I was disappointed to see that oil had seeped out of the container into the bag- gross- but to be expected with Mexican food.  Unfortunately, although plenty of oil had spilled out the the carton, there was still a ton in the container.  It was a soupy grease disaster.  Regardless of me ordering no cheese it was covered, which only added to the grease factor.  

Despite the look of the food I pressed on and with each bite I was more and more disgusted.  The chicken was poor quality.  It was fatty and had excess cartilage.  I could barely taste the green chili sauce through all the oil.  It was so bad I threw it away after a few bites.  

It looked NOTHING like the photos online and was genuinely disgusting.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went there today on the recommendation of a coworker who was working with me. 

It's kind of a small, hole in the wall, strip mall location. That's not a negative, some of the best food I've had, has been in small, out of the way places.

 I had a Carlito's Beef Burrito Smothered. (ground beef  double-meat, no veggies, smothered with green chile sauce), and a fountain soda. 

The burrito was large, drenched in green chile sauce. It was good, the flavor of New Mexico food, which I like.

The fountain soda were of the Coke genre. They also had bottle Mexican soda (the kind with sugar, instead of HFCS). The had Horchata, Jamaica and Orange in the bubbling fountain dispensers.

My coworker had a chicken bowl with salad on it, he said it was good.

My coworker also explained at Hatch chile time of year, they roast the chiles in the parking lot there.

I don't spend a lot of time on that side of town, but if I was in the area, I would definitely eat there again. Give them a try."}
{"text":"When I got there I was not greeted, I have been standing at the register for a couple minutes until someone had said something. A waitress had walked past me a couple times and did not say anything. There was another waitress that was being rude to one of the cooks, and it was a shame sight to have seen that in front of a customer. I ordered through yelp, I could pick what I wanted in my bowl. I made sure I did not select cheese. When I had gotten my food, I opened it up in my car and sure enough there was cheese. I can't eat cheese... so yes I was upset and did not eat any of it...."}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened here, everyone used to talk about how great this joint was, and now everyone I know avoids it. Now I know why. I tried it for the 3rd and final time and I can't give Carlito's any more chances.

Terrible food! I am not sure why their food has been consistently bland, watery, and put together carelessly... But it is so bad. I have eaten here a few times since their move, trying different things in an attempt to find something edible... No dice. It's just NOT good food in taste, quality or presentation. That is the reality.

Rude owner and staff. He seems like he has a major attitude. I have personally dealt with him over the phone before, not the most pleasant person, but I can overlook a grumpy demeanor most of the time... Until I decided to browse through the reviews and read his bitter and childish responses to customers. Now I am actually glad I won't be giving this place my business anymore (along with most of the people I know who used to eat here). Honestly if you can't handle harsh criticism, don't own a restaurant. Also find new staff or something, they aren't any more pleasant to deal with and make the experience uncomfortable. This entire establishment needs an overhaul, and I am not sure that would be enough to fix it's crashing reputation in the area.

Health department grade of C... Need I say more?

If you guys are looking for sub-par, overpriced \"New Mexican\" food that is basically a sad imitation of what it should be then by all means eat here. If you actually do have taste buds, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"2nd trip for breakfast! Wow even better. It was early Saturday morning after I finished a project in the neighborhood so I found myself all alone in the place. Greeted right away. Had my favorite huevos this time with chorizo. Wow spicy good enjoyed every bite. Still have a the navajo taco on my bucket list. Maybe tonight. 

Greatest green chili in the valley hands down!"}
{"text":"Daily specials, $3 margaritas, posole, green chile stew, more. This is a cute and cheap place for New Mexican eats. 2 for 1 breakfast burritos on Sundays - huge- includes hashbrowns inside."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall in one of the countless minimalls in Vegas.  We wandered by with empty bellies and no expectations.  We were ridiculously surprised and were immediately trying to figure out when we could go back.

Highlights:
- Pork pozole.  Holy cow.  How did that sauce taste so freaking delicious?
- Taco.  Fried on site and amazing.  Fresh and delightful.  The best fried taco I've ever had.
- Sopapilla.  Yeah, I could eat those with honey all day long every day.

We'll be back.  I'm not sure when.  But we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying the food here for years. The new location and addition of the BBQ is a real plus.  I am not sure when it happened but they recently added some items on the menu.  Most notably for me was the chili relleno's.  I have long been a fan of chili relleno's and am thoroughly impressed with the Carlitos version.  Unlike traditional chili relleno's I have experienced here in Vegas these are deep fried to a crispy crust and are not served with sauce unless ordered (with either red or green).  The honesty of the chili is highlighted by simplicity of this dish.  If your looking for bold chili flavors you will be happy with Carlitos."}
{"text":"I got some sort of asada burrito here and it was hefty!!! So much stuff and meat inside! If you're looking for something that's flavorful and filling, come get a burrito here! The service is awesome, just as awesome as their burrito. You can tell it's good too just from walking in because it's busy."}
{"text":"There aren't enough good things that can be said about this place. 

I've been hitting Carlito's every weekend for months now, and I'm constantly pleased. The service is quick, the food is always fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is great. 

If you're a Vegas local and have friends/family in town, take them to Carlito's and they'll thank you."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Casual self seating dining room. Wide variety on menu - breakfast served all day. Family and kid friendly. Be careful about additional cost of extra items - just ask. Busboy was the nicest and most helpful employee! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Green Chili at its finest, this is a must try if you enjoy hot food that is delicious. The green chili pork burrito was Simply Amazing. The place was packed"}
{"text":"Spicy, spicy, spicy!!!  Now that that is out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my eating experience here.  I recently moved from the San Diego area, so I am very particular about my Mexican food and have been hesitant to try out a new place for fear of disappointment.  Carlito's came up in my search for Mexican food and this NEW Mexican burrito did not disappoint!  I ordered the pork verde burrito wet to go.  My order came out quickly and the portions are huge!  The staff was also friendly, which is certainly a must for me.  I will definitely be returning here again.  I am anxious to see what their other menu choices have to offer."}
{"text":"Good burritos and sauces. I went during the week to try their Chili Relleno special and I would NOT recommend it. Stick with the burritos and sauces. Other members of my family love this place though."}
{"text":"Dang! I should have tried this place sooner. It's a small spot kind of tucked away in a shopping complex but they a have a big bright sign and you can't miss it. It's pretty tiny inside but they have a good amount of seating and a nice little bar area up front.

The food was excellent! I've been seeing all the picture of those smothered burritos and had to have one. I went with the pork verde then added rice and beans. The pork itself was super tender, I loved the green sauce and their burritos are huge! My wife and son shared the chicken fajitas which they loved. They give you a lot of toppings for the fajita's and I believe the tortillas are homemade...awesome on both dishes. On the smothered burrito, the green sauce starts to soak in the tortilla making it really soft and chewy...sooooo good!

Biggest downer of this place for me...the chips. They have really good salsas and an excellent guacamole but the chips fell short in a big way. I don't know what the seasoning is on them but it lacks any salt and it's really plain. Add a little salt and they're better but still kinda disappointing. Otherwise I really liked Carlito's and will definitely be going back. Can't beat excellent food with cold beers for a cheap price!"}
{"text":"Although its New Mexican - Mexican food, it's the only decent Mexican food place in Vegas. Growing up in Arizona, we had phenomenal Sonoran Mexican food in the southern part of the state, and good New Mexican food in the mining areas around Globe/Miami.  What we have in Vegas is California or even worse - east coast influenced Mexican food. No heat, no flavor, and so very bland.  The carne adovada at Carlito's could be a little more spicy for my taste, but I'd definitely recommend it to my friends. They do a lot of BBQ events in conjunction with wine/liquor tastings at Lees Liquors. Their green chili tri-tip and ribs are phenomenal. Huge servings and so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The title says it all.. it's mainly burritos and they are delish. I love coming here early for their fantastic breakfast burritos. Smothered you say? Yes I say.. I prefere the red sauce.. the co-workers love the green, and they get a special added sauce inside... good stuff I hear. I love the nachos too!! Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It had been a good long while since I had Carlitos (prior location). The new location offers more room but I wonder how full it gets. There were only a small handful on the Wednesday afternoon of this visit. 

I had the chicken bowl with everything except rice. Decent flavor but was way too watery without rice. Wont do that again."}
{"text":"Great new mexico style food. If your from New Mexico you'll recognize this style of mexican food.  The red and green chili is great"}
{"text":"One of those places you have to know is there. Once you find the place, you will be back! The restaurant is great! Food is in large portions and freshly made. VERY reasonably priced and good selection. I always get the Carlito's burrito which is stuffed with your choice of meat and covered with sauce. Friendly staff and great food!! Yes, we all know the shopping center is difficult to get in and out of, but that does not stop me from going to Carlito's Burritos."}
{"text":"Carlito's is the B-O-M-B. I am such a fan of this place and then some. I have been here time and time again and not once been disappointed in the food. The prices are beyond reasonable and the service is decent.

I have inhaled several items on the menu and here is how the rank on the medal stand:
1. Nachos- Insane! Number 1 in town! I want them in my belly right now!
2. Enchiladas- Yes, you are pretty too, Miss Enchiladas. (Get it with green sauce)
3. Tamales- excellent
4. Tacos- Yes, please

They serve beer and margaritas and my favorite Horchata-drink of the Gods!!! I cannot say enough wonderful things about Carlitos. Only negative is the space itself is tiny and because the food is out of this world you might have to wait a few minutes and get it to go. It's worth it. One bite and you will be addicted to it, too!"}
{"text":"Well. We came back again. The margaritas are great! The servers-- not so much. Lacking customer service skills. No one came over to see if we had changed our mind about ordering food, or if we needed any more margs or beers."}
{"text":"Visited Carlito's Burritos to purchase a 30 pound sack of Hatch, New Mexico chiles. It is chile season and Carlito's had 30,000 pounds available. You could purchase them roasted or not. The roaster was set up out outside next to the patio and only takes about five minutes. 
The trip across town was a good reason to experience their lunch. 
Food ordering done at the counter and delivered to your table. Non alcoholic beverages are self serve. The line at noon time moved quickly and the wait time after ordering was short. 

I started with a small bowl of Green Chile Stew. Great flavor, right amount of heat. The stew was loaded with fork tender pork and many chunks of potatoes. The large size would be a complete meal in a bowl. Next was the Chile Rellenos. 2 battered Hatch green chiles stuffed with jack cheese and smothered with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. These chiles were large and enough to take one home. A side order of pinto beans were tender and flavorful but could have used more garlic for my taste. 

The restaurant had plenty of staff to deliver food and were efficient in removing empty dishes."}
{"text":"First time at Carlito's and was worth the 20 minute drive. I had a chicken and black bean burrito smothered with green chile sauce. I added jalapenos, lettuce, onions and cilantro to it. They were quite generous with the green chile and the sauce was so tasty.  Also ordered the sides of rice, retried beans and the sopapilla.  The rice and beans were okay, but the sopapilla had me at the first bite. It was piping hot and we drizzled it with honey and it was amazingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and eat again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is definitely 5 stars...but the customer service is one. I call to place a to go order on Sunday's and this is the third time they have been incredibly rude. They speak very condescending and act as if when you are calling it is a burden on their life. Too bad too since the food is great they should try being a little more welcoming to their customers."}
{"text":"Eleven years ago, I moved to Vegas from Las Cruces, NM. Aside from my good friends, the thing I miss the most about New Mexico is the food. There is nothing quite like New Mexican food. Then a friend of mine who moved here from Cruces shortly before I did told me about Carlito's. Of course I had to check it out. 

I must say that Carlito's does a fabulous job of bringing a little slice of home (New Mexico) to Vegas. Everything that I've tried I've enjoyed, but I'm a die hard enchiladas fan. And I eat them like a New Mexican - stacked and with sour cream. The sopapillas are always hot & always delicious. One day I will have to check out the margaritas and report back on them as well. 

If you like to cook with chiles, I would suggest getting on their mailing list or liking them on Facebook so that you are in the loop for when the Hatch chiles will be arriving."}
{"text":"I think one of the problems here is that most folks don't know the difference between Mexican food and \"New Mexican\" food until you walk into Carlitos....I am from New Mexico and as soon as I took my first bite, I knew I was eating \"New Mexican\" food. There is nothing like Hatch chili. I've had Mexican food and while I do enjoy some dishes, there is nothing like Hatch chili. It all starts there and it's the only chili Dave uses. Carlitos is the only place in Las Vegas that serves it the way I like it. Dave has a loyal following and will be around for a long time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite breakfast burrito spot in the Henderson area. 

I have tried both Fausto's and Roberto's, but they did not really impress me too much. After seeing reviews of Carlito's Burritos, I desperately wanted to come by and try them out. 

Today, I ordered the breakfast burrito with ham/sausage/bacon. The burrito was a decent size but smaller than I expected. The burrito was definitely hearty and they are generous with their ingredients. Most breakfast burrito spots will try to fill their burritos with fillers (potato, rice, etc), but this burrito was 85% egg & meat and 15% potato. I liked that the hash browns in the burrito were extra crispy. It adds additional texture to the burrito."}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend and he was spot on.  The pork verde burrito - NOT enchilada style with a side of fresh serrano chiles was fantastic.  All meat - not chunks of fat - perfectly cooked and priced right.  I will be back - great food."}
{"text":"Waited in line for a long time for a couple to order while an unused cash register stayed unused and employees looking around. No customer service available. 
Del Taco, Taco Bell and Roberto's are faster and has better service."}
{"text":"This is the best New Mexican food anywhere. Everything on the menu is delicious. I come here often and I am never disappointed. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I realized a long time ago that Mexican food is generally 5 basic ingredients re-arranged in different ways. Beans, Cheese, Meat, Tortilla, Salsa, Sauce, sometimes rice. And while Carlito's is no exception to my keen observation, they do some great re-arranging. 

Tucked away in the south east, Carlitos is probably the only thing keeping this small strip mall in business. The place itself is pretty tiny, and probably can't seat more than 25 people. Yet despite its small size and odd location, the place is usually packed by regulars who are familiar with the food and know what they want.

Carlitos offers traditional fare such as burritos, tacos, nachos and the like. But they throw in some new things to the mix, the sliders (mexican style mini burgers wrapped in tortillas with a chilli relish), green chili stew (super spicy), and the sopapillas (which are essentially fryed fluffy tortillas which they use for a dessert or stuff them for bigger meals)

The food is great for the price. Getting a full meal with a drink is easy under $10, and on top of that they have $1 draft beers (they have their own brew I guess) The tacos are made fresh which deep fryed tortillas made on the spot, and the sopapillas make great fluffy desserts. I thought the huge burrito I ordered was a little on the bland side. Each week day they have specials going on, the best is probably $1 taco tuesdays. Just remember that the place gets packed. Tell your friends to grab a seat or get it to go. Definitely worth checking out if your into Mexican food and tired of your regular places."}
{"text":"OMGosh, I absolutely love the food here. I brought my aunt in for dinner, this evening, and she was very impressed and even ordered some more food to take home. It's a little taste of home without having to travel 8 hours to get it."}
{"text":"They are trying to pay for their new location and while I will agree they needed to get rid of some of their degenerate regulars at the old place and some of their seedy staff. They should have kept the good stuff.. They used to have dollar ground beef tacos on tuesdays......No More! Used to have dollar beer.....No More! Big margaritas....No More! I used to go there all the time.....No More!! 
I tried the new location and the higher prices. The tacos are skimpy. The pitchers of beer were supposed to fill 4 glasses according the the server and it barely filled 2 3/4. We took relatives there and had bragged about the green chile sauce and tacos. We were embarrassed. Get back the good specials and I will come back too."}
{"text":"I asked the girl behind the counter who hated her job to give me a vegan burrito. Apparently cheese is vegan. I have dairy allergies and this is not OK!!!! I'm so angry considering I drove all the way there to get this. I'm angry. :-("}
{"text":"Growing up in L.A. there were hundreds of Mexican restaurants and I had my share of pork chili Verde burritos. The best I had was in Pasadena, but Carlito's burritos is right up there forget the side of rice and beans at  $3.00 more it should come with it. But for  $7.95 it was a good deal."}
{"text":"This is a close to authentic NEW Mexican food as you're going find here. I recommend having a Navajo taco with green Chile  and add a sopapilla."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 stars is that, if you're trying to eat there...forget it- open tables a scarce and they've crammed what they can into this little place. Need a larger space. It's loud and busy, but AWESOME for the food. If you get the right person at the right time of day they can be friendly and not rushed. I usually order ahead (give each my number for the discount) & wait in the long line to pick up. Could benefit if there was a pick-up and order lines, but again....LIMITED SPACE. Everything I've had has been great with plenty of flavor. Sopapillas with the honey...great sweet snack. Pork Verde (Carlitos Burrito) & smothered is the way to do it!!! Share or make it lunch and dinner!!! Breakfast burritos are great as well. Give yourself some time, and go!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok we had a wet burrito and it was not hot just luke warm when server brought it to table. In addition the staff is not friendly cashier was very grumpy. Busy place but this was disapointing
."}
{"text":"We were HIGHLY disappointed! We walked in and no one greeted us. When we were finally approached, we were told to order at the bar. We proceeded to order two VERY expensive stuffed soppapillas and two sodas for $36.00. When we were served the food, there was no garnish like lettuce or tomato and the sour cream was an extra charge of $.75. The food was good and had good flavor, but it was served in an oversized pie tin. It breaks my heart to see a place I have going to every time I visit Vegas for many years, go downhill so fast. The service was so bad that I hope they hire people that actually like people and want to keep customers! Wasted time, money and effort to drive to Henderson, only to have been disappointed by a place I use to love. Sad."}
{"text":"I am in love with Carlitos Burritos!!! Best new mexican food in Vegas!!my best friend is from New Mexico and she says that is real good new mexican food! I've personally tried a bunch of items from the menu and they were all wonderful. My favorite is a green chile smothered bacon and sausage breakfast burrito...they are half off on Wednesdays, and 2x1 on sundays!"}
{"text":"This is a classic spot to take out of town guests who want to get off the Strip and see how the locals live.    This place has it all:  small, noisy bistro with great prices and a rocking Southwestern cuisine.  We've been four or five times and although the wife experiments with the menu, I cannot get past that Green Chile Steak Sopapilla, which is one of my favorite dishes of this decade.  Go in and just order it."}
{"text":"GREASY!!!!!!
Picked up a pork and a beef Carlito's burritos to go, when I got home the red oil had drenched the inside of the bag! Good thing it didn't leak or else my car seat would have been permanently stained. Menu described complimentary add ons and premium add ons, well the cashier didn't even ask if I wanted the extra ingredients which I thought at least the complimentary add ons would have been included. Oh well, live and learn I guess. Afterwards I took my wife's plate to wash and the red sauce was so greasy that even dawn dish detergent wouldn't faze it! Oh no, I don't think I will come back. They have some Vegan choices? Really? Talk about extremes!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Navajo taco with carne adovada. Good. Not great. Fry bread could have been crispier and meat was room temperature. Also ordered the pork verde burrito combo smothered with green chili. Got the retried beans. This was excellent. Complex flavors. Spicy. And hot. Beans were so good I would consider just ordering them separately!  Or smothered in green chilis. We would definitely go back. It was small and crowded but it was fairly quick service!"}
{"text":"What a great find. If you like a good spicy meal, might I recommend the following:
Tamale smothered with Red sauce. 
You'll want to include the Calabacitas in the same plate. 
If that isn't enough for you, add a small bowl of Green Chile Stew. 

We call this the Tim Special. Don't think you can order it that way yet...but maybe over time they'll add it to their menu."}
{"text":"There is no way I can eat a smothered carne asada burrito with green sauce.  I could barely eat any of it, it was too spicy.  I like to enjoy my food, not have heartburn for DAYS.  Please re-think your sauce selection, and it would be nice if you let your customers know that the green sauce will blow you out of the water!


2.24.17
In response to the owner...one should never assume that everyone knows everything about everything and no, it was not the first time I'd had New Mexican food.  Also my mom ordered her sauce on the side, and the burrito was smothered in sauce.  She could not eat hers either.  Waste of food."}
{"text":"Amazing. The beat nachos by far. So plentiful and amazing. Their tacos are just as good. Breakfast burritos are the reasons wednesdays were made. Navajo taco so goooood. I love Carlitos. From the food to the staff to their frequent flier program. Love em. Makes me wish I was raised in new mexico."}
{"text":"This is a place I come to when I want food that reminds me of where I am from. I'm from New Mexico and it def hits the spot every time and gets it right."}
{"text":"Have you been here before?  Everyone needs to be familiar with this place. The cuisine of New Mexico has its own charm and deliciousness and the margaritas are amazing. The staff is conscientious and friendly.  And, having moved to this new location, theres plenty of elbow room (including outside seating). I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is fast! Fairly cheap for the amount of food you get! Menu is confusing and location is small, comparable to roberto's."}
{"text":"(In response to Dave's query on issues for team meeting) 05/07/2015 

Thanks so much for addressing this issue. No there aren't any other issues that we feel need to be covered. We have eaten at Carlito's on two other occasions and the food was good. 

-No"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor.  Whatever you get, get it smothered with green chile (or red if you prefer).  Once again, amazing flavor.  The restaurant is small, so you may have to wait for a table, but is worth waiting for the food.  The portions are huge and the price is very affordable.  I have tried several different menu items and have always been satisfied.  A co-worker raves about the smothered fries (that is next on my list).  You can even get a burger smothered.  Great food, great value"}
{"text":"Two of the people I was with, who lived in New Mexico, proclaimed this place to have amazing New Mexican food. Who am I to argue? I will agree that the food is fantastic and inexpensive. But, if you're sensitive to spicy foods, watch out.

If you're hungry, get the combo burrito ($5.95). It's a veggie burrito with meat. You get your choice of beans (I opted for pinto) plus rice and calabacitas. If you're like me, you'll probably have to ask what that is. Calabacitas are sautéed squash, onions, corn and peppers. I also went with the pork verde as my meat choice. If you do want it spicy, get it smothered with your choice of red or green sauce or both. Without the sauces, the food is perfect for people who don't want their mouth on fire. It's probably one of the best burritos in town (at least from what I've tried) and a great value.

Order at the counter and they'll bring the food out to you. Even during non-peak hours the place can be busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. But, it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Once again a delicious meal of smothered fries. Worth the drive from wherever you are. Green chilies is spicy and the pork is tender. Staff is awesome"}
{"text":"Its hard for a New Mexican to find true \"New Mexican\" food. This place takes me back to my home town of Santa Fe, the variety of dishes will leave you many choices. You can always enjoy good conversation at the bar with its great employees!"}
{"text":"An excellent spot to go for real New Mexican food.  It's a small place with a nice local restaurant feel.  The red and green chile is awesome, and they roast their own green chile when they are in season.  I recommend anything on the menu as it pretty much rocks!  Their sopapillas are very tasty, but a little heavier than I might have liked.  Still the prices are inexpensive and for New Mexican fare, it beats the pants off the other places you might go."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing and authentic atmosphere. Food made to order so there is a slight wait but well worth it. Also offers original artwork on display and for purchase and beer;)"}
{"text":"Carlitos, New Mexico style. Slightly hot sauces, but oh, what flavor!  Recommend the burritos (any) chicken enchiladas and the pork, very tender!  Ask for Joe's Special. Maybe you shouldn't go there, I don't want to be waiting for a table. :-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I recommend going here if you have not. I can go with my friends who eat meat and the ones who are vegan. I love that they give you a GOOD portion size of guacamole. The chips have this awesome seasoning on them too. The burritos are HUGE and the green chilie is to die for.

I sometimes make my order difficult since I can be picky and they NEVER mess it up. I have spent my last 2 birthdays here since it's an all ages place. You can order beer, margaritas, mexican coke, or even horchata. Place is soemtimes busy but fast service. You can do pick up orders too. 

If you go as much as I do, sign up for coupons and discounts. You just have to give them your # everytime you order for a discount. I just got a $5 coupon off my next order since I go here so much!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting here- I try to go to the smaller mom/pop eateries to support the local economy, plus the food is much better than the chain locations. I ordered the beef burrito with green sauce. Its a good-sized portion, and the green sauce is pretty good. The burrito itself was like a flour bag of plain beef with jalapenos thrown in. Lots of heat, but no flavor at all or seasonings in the meat. So I wasn't impressed at all with this item. I will go back and try something else next, hopefully that may be a bit better!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. One of those days driving around asking myself what's for lunch today? 
I walked in around noon and the place was jammin. Almost all of the tables full and a line to the door.That was good cuz it gave me time to study the menu. I decided to try the steak with the red sauce and added guac and sour cream. The buritto was very good just a little messy, which is not a problem for me. The steak was very tender and almost melted in my mouth.
I want to go back soon try try so many thing, mostly the stuffed sopapillas. They brought one out to a table next to the take out line and it looked really good....next time for sure!"}
{"text":"New Mexican in Las Vegas where the red sauce is hot and the green sauce is hotter.

It isn't \"Mexican.\" So get that out of your head before you go. The chili is only the best from Hatch New Mexico.

Carlito's is a little hole in the wall that is just too good to pass up. Thankfully they are expanding! They're moving November 25th to the new location (4300 E Sunset).

My favorite is the stuffed sopapilla with pork verde and green sauce. The sopapilla is made fresh right then and there, then stuffed full with tender pork, smothered in green sauce. The green sauce is HOT and to DIE for.

Be sure to get on their frequent diners program and get 10% off! If you dine there often enough, you even get some credit."}
{"text":"I Love Carlitos.  Love them!  But i have to say something has changed with their cook or recipes.  Taste has been off the last two times i have been there.  I hope they read this an fix whatever is going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If you've ever eaten in NM you know that the hospitality is always on point. Well today I came to eat at carlito's at their new location. While the place is nicer the service is horrible, the front register staff didn't know what any of the items were and also very slow and behaved like her job was taking away from her FB time. Then when we went to sit down there were 14 tables that were dirty which left no place to sit to eat. 30 min of being there and I finally ask the owner if they can clear some tables and he responded with ya I'll get there. Then 3 more min pass and I clear a table and go ask for a towel to wipe it and he again responded with a smug attitude \"I said I'll be there and said were short staffed\" sarcastically.... I NOW have had enough,...so I said I see, and obviously not well managed either.. As he continued to fill a pitcher, I walked back to the table I had cleared. He came out from behind the counter and removed some other items from one of the 14 tables that had been dirty, but not the one we were waiting at,  and I said WOW unbelievable and he came up and wiped our table and said I can give your money back!!! So I told him that would be great.. I followed him to the register and asked to speak with the manager he replied I'm the owner. So I informed his is leadership skills for a restaurant were horrible and by seeing how he behaved like a child really explained why his staff behaves the way he leads.... So needless to say Carlitio's owner, please take a leadership class and maybe even a hospitality course wouldn't hurt, so hopefully you can learn to lead in a posite and productive manner instead of a jack ass manner...."}
{"text":"We have eaten a few times at the original Carlitos Burritos location and it was amazing. My family is from New Mexico and eating the food brought back nostalgic memories of being in my grandma's kitchen. We tried out the new location and it broke my heart. Not only was the food lacking the rich flavor of the Hatch chile's, green chile chicken and pork tamales had no green chile, the beans and calavasita were flavorless.  The service when attention was brought to food flavor was an \"I don't care\" type of attitude no effort was made to fix the situation all we got was a \"well do you want something else\" as we were leaving. The original location we were made to feel like family. This new location was just \"next\" mentality  and on to whoever is next in line. Total dissapointment."}
{"text":"I love their everything breakfast burrito when they do the half off specials on Wednesday morning up until 11 AM and the two for one Sunday breakfast burritos. I really can't picture paying 9 dollars for any kind of burrito so I go when they have a deal on them. They are completely stuffed with scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile PLUS  bacon, chorizo, sausage and ham. That makes for one really filling burrito. I go for the green sauce because it's spicier and I love spicy food. I would have to say don't smother it because it turns this thing into a fork and knife meal and that's not what breakfast burritos should be about. This place uses extremely fresh ingredients and I love that. The one Debbie downer would have to be that the guy running the register always seems to be kind of miserable, I wish they would hire someone that could greet you as you walked in the door and smile while they take your order."}
{"text":"CARLITOS should have never moved.... when it was a small joint...it was on the top of our list... going out to eat is a very important thing to us.... and when we lose a place it is very sad.... carlitos had great food and fantastic ambience at its former location.... you could sit at the bar and see people that frequented the place for the same reason... it wasn't just a place to eat ,..it was a place where you could socialize with people who came from far and wide for the same thing... cheap draft beer ... incredible food and people you got to know ... it was a hangout..... i have no idea why he decided to move but we will not go back... i am sure the food is still good but that was not the only reason we went there.."}
{"text":"went in at 8:30pm on a weeknight.  Had half an hour until close.  Place was fairly busy with three women at counter downing margaritas.  They were very \"happy\" and so loud that my head hurt!  Everyone was screaming and laughing and hanging on each other and the other customers.  I finally had to ask who worked there.  We decided to order for takeout and I told the woman bartender that it was our first time at the place.  She wasn't helpful as to toppings, extras, etc.  Frankly, I wanted to leave the parking lot before the women did.  One other customer got her car keys and brought the car to the front door.  Why are they serving customers that appear so intoxicated?  Oh yeah, food was ok but I was totally turned off by the yelling and craziness."}
{"text":"The guy \"owner\" below me obviously has no idea what good food is! Yes sir you are correct your reviewers are wrong they must be from Las Vegas most people from here eat horrible food because that's the only option! Not to be rude but for a business owner you are very unprofessional as well. This is truthful criticism from a family of four with superb taste!   Coming from Europe and traveling to many, many places I can tell you that this was a horrible tasteless unauthentic Mexican place. You must not be Mexican! Also the bbq what a joke! We were Completely grossed out! Authentic Mexican try Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Ever since carliot's burittos moved to the new location they're food has gone down in taste and up in price! The food is not the same and the \"barbecue\"  is not BARBECUE! I was raised in New Mexico this is not \"Hatch, New Mexico chili\" I used to brag about Carlito's Burrito's not anymore thumbs down not going back."}
{"text":"I had quite a good vegan burrito here. The veggie burrito had a lot of flavor and the green chili was great with a good amount of spice. Ordering was a bit intense though. There were quite a few people behind me and I felt rushed and flustered. Apparently, I get order anxiety under pressure. 

I was impressed with the final product. It was big but not giant and getting it smothered with green chili was the way to go. The only thing that I wasn's a fan of was the plastic forks and disposable metal pans. It is hard to eat a big burrito with plastic cutlery and it also isn't very eco friendly. That won't stop me from eating there again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now. Both times there was hardly anyone here. The food is so-so... not a lot of flavor. It pretty much all tastes like it came from a can. The service is lacking. 
The main reason for two stars is due to my last visit. Our family came in for dinner. My niece ordered the toquito plate. It took forever to get her food. We were the only people in the place.  When she got her food it was still frozen in the middle! She took it back and got something else and they charged her for both!! Are you kidding me? Not even an apology! Very poor customer service! This was our last time eating here."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Mexico and grew up with New Mexican food. My family made it from scratch so my standard is high. This place has the best NM chile and the food is the closeting thing to being back home taste in NV. Find out the difference between New Mexican and Mexican food by stoping by."}
{"text":"This is the only \"New Mexican\" food I have been able to find in Las Vegas.  For those who know the difference and want authentic Hatch chili read no further and just go...now!
New Mexican fare differs from other forms of Mexican food because it is focused around Hatch chilies.  This ingredient comes from Central New Mexico where all the stars align to produce this unmatched and unmistakeable chili.  The owner stays true to Senoran New Mexican cuisine and gives you the option to chose from red or green in most of their dishes.
Some of my favorites include red chili adovada enchiladas layered style with a fried egg on top, green chili chicken enchiladas, and the nachos.  Also, there are always specials which are delicious (I love the ribs).  And don't forget to save room for a sopapilla for dessert!  
Being that my father was from New Mexico, this was the food I was raised on.  If you haven't tried it, give it a go and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Review:

Last year I had gone to New Mexico and had the best South Western food experience.  Doing my research on Yelp, I had found Carlito's and my excitement went up.  However, it went back down when I cut into my burrito.  They put way too much rice and less beans in my burrito.  New Mexico is all about their refried beans and how great they taste.  Carlito's sauce was super hot, not like the kinds I tried out there.

My fiance did love his carne burrito, so that's one extra star for his enjoyment.  

Don't plan on coming back here during my next visit to Vegas, I have to get it right or nothing.  Conclusion, if you're a meat eater, this will be a great place, you should check it out.  As a vegetarian, not so great."}
{"text":"The customer service was honestly some of the best I've ever had and the food was amazing. The woman at the counter was super sweet and had great customer service. There was honestly not one bad thing I could say about my experience and I would highly suggest going there if you want to try something different. The green chile you cannot find anywhere in town and the carne adovada was bomb bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked coming here but this place has gone down hill. Please guys especially for your New Mexican customers Don't hold out on the chili. I ordered a breakfast burrito with green chili. I noticed it didn't say green chili on the receipt so I asked the cook. He confirmed it did. I got my order and got home to a burrito with no chili! I'm not a guy to complain normally but the fact that I double checked before I left with the cooks rubbed me the wrong way. I called and they said they would replace it. I was in a few days later to get my burrito. Before I left I confirmed with cooks if it had chili. I got home to a burrito that was ALL eggs hardly any bacon or hash browns and 2 very small pieces of green chili........come on guys....Also I know not too many people ordered the blue wedge salad and tried tip plates but my girl loved those and you guys don't have them anymore....please guys we used to come here weekly sometimes daily but we don't come anymore. I would rather go to Coffee Cup in Boulder City. They know how to do a green chili breakfast burrito right... Good luck guys.."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I had a loaded carne asada burrito which was pretty tasty. I did not consider it to be authentic Mexican food, but would not have a problem eating here again if I were in the area. I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Both the green and house salsas have no heat and zero flavor. They are served with store bought type corn chips and not the fresh warm deep frird corn tortilla chips you get in most mexican food places. I only ate 2 bites of the guac because the chips are so nasty. The guac was ok but the chips ruined it. It is a shame you have to pay for chips and salsa  and get the quality of this. 

The steak tacos, dry and no flavor served on a stale fried and hard flat corn tortilla. I ate 2 bites of the cold dry steak tacos. I could not swallow the dry meat. I even tried to smother a taco in their plain boring salsa but it didn't help. They look more like a tostada with no beans. Very weird taco experience. Not the hot jucy flavorful steak one expects. The chili relleno was ok but not great. Again, no flavor and no spice.  I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"what kind of place has a \"burrito\"  with nothing but meat inside and names it after the store?  very disappointing. $9 for this mess.  Obviously I'm to blame for ordering their specialty."}
{"text":"Best Chile Rellenos I've ever had!  Enjoyed with a side salad which was surprisingly fresh and tangy.  Only improvement I could recommend is the ordering experience.  Could be friendlier at the register.  Definitely worth the visit for a meal."}
{"text":"The ironic thing about Las Vegas is the fact that despite being located in the middle of the desert, good Mexican food can be hard to find. As a native New Mexican, this place keeps me sane. Honest-to-God Hatch green chile, tender carne avodaba, sopapillas to cry for...this place has it all!"}
{"text":"Pros- as far as I can tell this is authentic New Mexican chili they serve here and its pretty tasty. 
Cheap beer and margaritas served here
Overall the portion sizes are very generous
Prices are very good for what you get on the food as well

Cons-
Place is filthy and as the years go by a lack in pride of ownership is starting to show
Very cramped with a poor layout. Its always uncomfortable to navigate your way past diners and ppl getting self serve fountain drinks as you make your way back to order. They need to rearrange that place because when busy its a nightmare to dine in
Food quality has dimisnished in my opinion over the last 3 years."}
{"text":"I could write a one-line review of this place--

$10 for two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans, sopapilla, and a Mexican coke equals a happy belly. 


But I'll elaborate a bit.

Yes, it is a great deal. Yes, the flavors are delicious. But the real winner here is the green chili sauce. Is this Adderall? No, it's Carlito's green chili. This sauce makes you feel good all over, like you were donating money to charity or listening to George Michael (both of which I did on the day in question, so obviously it was a super good day). 

What I liked second best about the place was not its sopapilla (but really, eat that thing first when it comes out when it's hot and melty--it's not as good cold) or its Mexican coke (hands up if you h8 high fructose corn syrup) but how you can pick your sides. I'm not one for refried beans, but black beans make my heart sing out with joy, so getting to be all democratic and have a choice in my Mexican side dishes is casting a vote and knowing your candidate will win and be successful in office--I rocked that vote, my friends.

All of this is to say, try this place out. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (as much as something can be in Vegas can be in this sea of suburbia, amirite?) but if you seek it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So good! First time here & everything was great! Green sauce was super hot - but in a good way & tacos were delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Filth everywhere and they tried to feed my vegetarian boyfriend chicken. 

My boyfriend and I stopped here after reading the great reviews. I was also cool to see Santana, or a Santana look alike, had eaten here. I ordered the carne asada sopapilla, which is a dough shell stuffed with beef covered in sauce. It was NOT good. The pictures of it and of the rest of the food look amazing and so delicious, do NOT be fooled, for the opposite is true. The red sauce tasted like it has cinnamon in and it tasted old, almost sour-like. The sopapilla was raw on the inside and soggy on the outside- disgusting. I took a few bites to curb my starvation and left the rest.

My boyfriend ordered cheese enchiladas and they gave him chicken ones. He went over to the counter to let them know of the mistake and they ignored him for a good 6 minutes. Then the lady working the cashwrap/kitchen stared at him like he was some sort of weirdo for standing there trying to get her attention. He finally told them of the mistake and she looked the food over as if in disbelief. They made him new enchiladas. The tortillas were hard and stale on the ends and covered in that horrible sauce. He couldn't eat them after 2 bites so we left. 

The benches were dirty and needed a good wipe down. The tables had stacks of dirty plates on them and flies circling them. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or moped in ages; there was a thick blackish film with different colored bits of lint and trash all around the edges, sooo gross. Oh and a drunk man greeted us when we first walked in. Not sure if this place is aware but you're supposed to cut off customers when they're that inebriated, it could save their life! 

Anyways, we left and got tacos at this little taco shop called tacos Tijuana."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm mmmmmm good. My husband has been wanting to try this for awhile, it's a hidden little gem. Small, friendly and clean. We had a slider (wrapped in a tortilla not in a bun) steak burrito smothered in green chili sauce, chicken tamale smothered in red chili sauce and a pork santa fe sopapilla with the green chili sauce which was my absolute favorite! The green chili sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"Another one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:

Nachos (no meat, $6.50)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=pyMpCBcJmA49t_wZ_fsfaA
Cheese Quesadilla ($3.95)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=E5aH0xwP8-Ja4poLxosfDw

The Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQ
You have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.

The Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.

Overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.

{"text":"It's the real deal. Generous portions. New Mexico Hatch chilies. 

New Henderson location continues the New Mexico tradition with addition of Santa Maria-style Fire BBQ. Separate dine-in and take out areas with own grills. Also Patio dining.

They'll be roasting chili's by the bushel again in the parking lot come August."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating some good Mexican food and from what I was told this is the place. But I'm not to sure if I even want to try it due to the fact that everywhere I looked there was food or trash laying around and the girls in the front don't even wash their hand before or after handling food, drinks or money!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the home away from home for all of you who are from New Mexico. I had heard from 2 different New Mexican natives that this is the spot for New Mexican Cuisine. I came in on a Thursday around noon and this place was packed! I live around the area and I've always wanted to try them since I heard such good things about Carlitos. I finally had my chance last week. I ordered the sopapilla since that's their signature dish, right? I sat at the counter area right next to the cash register since I couldn't really find any other spots nor did I want to take an entire table to myself considering how busy they were. My order was served to me pretty quick and I was kind of shocked because it was busy and it's made to order type of thing. I was honestly a little bit underwhelmed by my order. The inside was just some kind of white fluff and the meat was just alright. I guess you really have to be from New Mexico to appreciate this kind of stuff. Although other patrons were ordering an assortment of different dishes that sounded delicious. I don't know if I will come back here and may just opt for somewhere like Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"What can I say .. every time I come to Vegas I have to come by this little spot that makes the best breakfast burritos at an affordable price. It's definitely a must."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until bf found it on Yelp. Definitely authentic New Mexican restaurant- menu reminded me of the times I've spent down there. 
  Bf got Breakfast Burrito with ham & bacon and green sauce but not wet (he avoids wet burritos when possible)- he really liked it and ate the whole thing.
  I got the Navajo Taco- love fry bread- with 2 sides (calabacitas- good, posole- stomach gave up before I got to it, so I'll be having it for lunch) & cinnamon sugar sopapilla- very light and fluffy and not too much sugar. The Navajo Taco came with a generous amount of meat and the green sauce was really good (albeit a little spicy for me). My favorite part was the fry bread even though I forgot to ask them to put it on top (I hate soggy bread), but it worked out because it was thick enough to not get too soggy."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that things are back on my 5-star scale for this place and their new location. The old favs are back on track and the live fire-q is on point! Check it out. 

To the owner: Yelp did not allow for me to respond to your message to me previously. Good work. Glad to be back and congrats again on the new space."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. And, don't judge a New Mexican food place by its exterior. Vital life lessons.

The food is fantastic. For my gringo tastebuds, the green chili sauce is a little spicy, but the flavor is amazing. I had the chicken burrito, and I'm pretty sure they used a whole chicken given the size of this thing. The ground beef was also delicious, and not at all the cheap tasting product that so many ground beef burritos are. 

It was 11am, so sadly I didn't try the margaritas (though it was five o'clock in Praia--an \"island nation off the coast of Senegal--thanks Wikipedia!). But my co-eaters espoused their deliciousness--I'll give them a shot next time. 

Staff was friendly and I fully anticipate being back the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My family is from New Mexico this is the next best thing to home cooked!  They know what time it is! One of my favorites is the stuffed sopapilla with green chili!  Also love the Navajo taco."}
{"text":"The food is really good and authentic and that's the only reason I go there! I gave it three stars because I don't like their customer service and their new locatin. There have been times that I ordered over the phone and they got it mixed up...the breakfast burrito is really good there."}
{"text":"In town for work from LA and searched for best breakfast burrito in Las Vegas. This place did not disappoint. The 2 for 1 breakfast burritos on Sunday were a bonus. If you find yourself needing to fill you breakfast burrito urge, this is the place.

FYI: Get it smothered."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. Was told by a friend that if I'm ever in Las Vegas to uber my way over there. It was absolutely outstanding New Mexican food. The Chile rellenos, pork tamale, tacos, I really over ate. Absolutely worth the ride from out hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food! And superb customer service. Not to mention the prices are not ridiculous as other Mexican restaurants. Would 100% recommend. Me and my boyfriend found a new spot."}

{"text":"Now this is real New Mexican food. I've been searching for decent New Mexican food for a long time and haven't found any until now. I came across Carlito's Burritos on Yelp and decided to give it a try based on the great reviews. They use actual hatch chiles. I had enchiladas Christmas style and they were right on point. My wife had the vegetarian burrito smothered Christmas style (ofcourse) and she loved it. My daughter ordered the Frito pie and it was a little too spicy for her. I ended up eating it and loved it. Next time i'm in Vegas, this is the first place that I will visit."}
{"text":"Best taco Tuesday in Las Vegas.  Awesome grilled chicken burritos with green chile sauce.
I definitely recommend trying this place out if you haven't had a chance.  The new location is much nicer than the old one, and has a lot more room to sit and eat.  The only issue I have, is that they are still operating like they are in their old location.  This can be confusing to customers, as it is a walk up and order, not sit down and order, type of a restaurant.  I think they could dramatically increase their dinner business by hiring a few GOOD servers to wait tables.  
C'mon owners, you've done the hard part, expanding your business, don't fall into the common pitfall that causes most restaurants to fail.  Spend a bunch of money expanding, cut back on food quality and service to try and save some money to pay that new big mortgage, then end up closing the doors a year later because you lost what made you good in the first place.  You must have good quality control and service in place, and take time to build your customer base.  Be aware of food costs and operating expenses, but never, ever, sacrifice food quality or service.  It's a tough business, much respect and thanks for bringing New Mexico food to Henderson, please stay around a long time!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of New Mexican cuisine. So i was excited to see someone in Las Vegas is making food from there exclusively. This place rocks. the ambiance is cool. Southwestern art, Indian pictures, etc. very awesome vibe.

Very simply this place is New Mexico plopped down in Las Vegas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is authentic, hot, fresh, and a plate of awesome. The burritos are the size of a 6 month old baby and can fill you up for the whole day. The green sauce is made with real \"Hatch\" chile's. can't wait to try the Indian Taco's 

Like to give a shout out to the owners. Thank you for bringing N.M. to Las Vegas. Keep up with the great food!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and always have a good experience and enjoy the food.  Sometimes they get busy so I have had to wait a bit, but that happens at any food place, so I just find a table and wait for them to bring it out and they do in a large portion!  If you are looking for more than fast food but don't want a full restaurant this is a great place to eat and I fully recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice.  It's small, homey (not sure if that is a word), and tasty.  Got a chille rellano and a fish taco.  Both were really good.  Portions are huge so order carefully.  Also got a couple of New Mexico beers, their IPA is great, not bitter, virtually no after taste.  Spent 12 bucks if I remember right.  How do you beat that?  Great staff also, keep it up."}
{"text":"Awesome New Mexican. The breakfast burrito is awesome. I love that you can add squash and smothered with red and green chilies for a wet burrito. Outstanding ! Great Value!"}
{"text":"This place was small, really small but busy. The line was almost out the door. You would think they did something right. I came here on the recommendation of my co-worker who swears that it's delicious. So where do I start, oh ya, the Micheladas (NOT GOOD). Watered down taste. I make better. The stuffed sopapillas were good, so my co-worker hit that on the dot but nothing to brag about and say that I want to go back. The locations is nowhere near the strip. The chicken tamale with chile verde wasn't all that great either. I've has some of the best tamales in Los Angeles. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this place but this is only my opinion. Lot's of older folks in here. The place had Indian Art Work on the walls which was really great. Maybe I should have ordered something else but I came here to order the sopapillas. NIce experience but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}

{"text":"Quite disappointed with the food after so many raves about it. I ordered enchiladas. 1 chicken 1 beef and they gave me all shredded beef that was overcooked. The rice and beans were just okay. Also, The staff looked all spaced out. Ill be going to coyotes next time"}
{"text":"I had a really good first experience here. They have a really good reputation and a couple of times I wanted to come but it was TOO full lol.

I finally stopped by and I the lady was super helpful.

She just had the perfect way for you to order while explaining to you what you are getting.

I got a Carlito's burrito. It was all meat. I didn't get it with beans or anything. The steak they use is delicious. You can get red or green sauce and also can get it smothered. I got christmas which was red and green mixed.

My food was good! 

We got a frito pie also which was huge! 

The sauces are spicy but SO GOOD! 

I joined the mailing list and I was happy to get an email. I thought the lady was lying.

All in all awesome service and awesome food."}
{"text":"I live 45 minutes away from this place and it's always worth the drive. Friendly service and great tasting food. The best New Mexican food in the city. I always get the Green chile stuffed chicken sopapita* with beans and rice. Been coming here for over a year and will always continue. This is like one of those joints that you'd see on Guy Fieri's Drive ins Diners and Dives but has yet to be on there!"}
{"text":"Carlito's has excellent burritos, with a style somewhere between Chipotle and Roberto's. The inside of the restaurant is pretty sparse, but they do have some décor on the walls and they actually have a small bar at the front. I didn't partake, but I know they at least have beer.
 The burritos are huge and stuffed with lots of good stuff. I had chicken, rice, black beans, and....my favorite....some kind of veggie mix. It came with all sorts of interesting vegetables like zucchini, yellow squash, and even artichoke hearts! Yum, totally made the meal. If you're like my husband and hate Chipotle (and the like) because they put rice and beans in your burrito, taking up valuable meat space, then you can get your burrito served \"Carlito's Way\" - double meat, and nothing else inside. Regardless of the style, the burrito is served in a takeout dish covered with your choice of sauce and accoutrements (sour cream, guac, pickled jalapenos, fresh jalapenos, Serrano peppers, etc). I got all the extras and ended up removing as many jalapenos as possible because it was super-spicy.
 Note that it costs a little bit more than Chipotle: for our 2 burritos it was $19."}
{"text":"I drove all the way across town to try this place, but they would not honor my Restaurant.com certificate that I paid money for.  That was a month ago, yet they are still selling them online today!!!  It's fraud.   They should consider this policy as it leads to multiple online postings of bad reviews.

Anyway their prices are high for Mexican food.  They spent all their time on the phone and ignored us when we went in.  We even sat down and nobody even noticed us.  We had to get up to fetch our own paper menus.   It's definitely not worth it at full price.  It's hard to find.  They're not nice.  That about sums it up.

No thanks."}
{"text":"Pop Quiz

Why did the gurlpren and I decide to eat at Carlito's Burritos?
A)  We were starving and looking for something close
B)  Because Alicia R (aka Yes) said this place was good and we had to try them
C)  We haven't had Mexican food in a while
D)  Most of our Yelp friends gave them solid reviews
E)  All of the above.

If you answered E, you're the 2nd smartest Yelper I know.  

Carlito's is located on the southeast side of town and I have to admit, I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food out here in the valley. Coming from San Diego, I never thought anyone out here would come close. Carlito's has changed my mind really quick.  But let me get one thing out of the way first.  When you drive up to this place, you see their sign that reads \"Carlito's Burritos, New Mexican Restaurant\".  That doesn't mean that this is a new establishment that serves Mexican food. It means that this is a restaurant that serves Mexican food from New Mexico.  Hah...I was one of those fools that misread their sign. 

Read the reviews, it's all about their burritos and tacos. But for me, it's all about their sopapillas, which is fry bread stuffed with chicken, shrimp, pork, or steak. Being the meat lover I am, I chose steak.  First impression...Man, this is a lot of food. I estimate around 8 oz of well prepared, well seasoned meat, stuffed into the fluffiest fry bread that I ever had. Top it off, it was literally topped off when red sauce. My meal was huge, but so good that my belly wouldn't allow me to quit until it was all gone.  Long story semi-long, try their sopapillas.  You won't be disappointed. 

Price is about average for most of their items. But the tacos and enchiladas are a steal of a price.  Big plus for service here. You get it with a smile, some convo, and of course, good food. 


PS: I also tried their chicken tamale and thought it was just okay. But that's just me."}
{"text":"This place was gross. I came here because of the good reviews but I should've just gone to jaliscos down the street or maybe even cafe rio! The chile was supposedly supposed to be bomb, it literally had no taste. The salsa was so supposed to be \"the best\" and it literally just tasted like tomatoes. Most of the flavor I got was from the tapatío that I dosed my food in. Wouldn't recommend this place, and I definitely won't be coming back. It's like they made their food without flavor on purpose? Jesus, a little salt or something people!"}
{"text":"Great food and relaxed  atmosphere to eat with friends and family. They give you a lot of food and great sides to go along with it. Enjoy :) we sure do."}
{"text":"Its a bit different from what most people think of when eating burritos.  Not a bad thing at all since the food is tasty indeed!  This is the first time I've had New Mexican food.

The portions are large.  I had trouble finishing my meal let alone the side I foolishly ordered.

My only complaint would be that since the food is a bit different than expected, some pictures might have been helpful.  Some people think that is tacky, but I think it can be warranted at times.  Also the tin trays give the impression of eating a pile of food from a trough."}
{"text":"Hmm, not sure what I've been doing not reviewing these guys.

I first tried them a few months back for the Navajo Taco. It was a bit of nostalgia for me as I had had a really gigantic version of this dish a long time ago on a Grand Canyon tour. The Carlito's version comes in a metal tin (like a lot of their dishes do, apparently) and has a lot of meat (I chose pork verde over carne adovada), shredded cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was pretty enjoyable, but not enough so that I would go back every day. I haven't felt the urge to try it again yet.

The second time I went was so that I could finally take advantage of their Sunday all-day 2-for-1 breakfast burritos. The basic burrito is scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile for $5.50, but I did the one meat option for $6.50. Yes, that's two for $6.50 at the special price.

I tried all the meats, and chorizo is definitely the best, with bacon a reasonable but not so meaty second and the sausage and ham options not really providing anything special that would make me want to order them ever again. I'm probably going to stock up on 6 of these or so one of these days for an entire week of breakfast burrito-y goodness.

Carlito's is simply a great, cheap local spot for New Mexican cuisine. Try to go at off-peak hours because seating and walkways are really cramped in there."}
{"text":"Out of this world- Huge- Yummy Burritos!  
***  2 for 1 Burritos on Sundays!***  The price is already great-- this is a steal!"}

{"text":"Carlito's is our favorite local place to hang out at. You can't beat the $2 beers and $3 margaritas! The food is authentic AND very yummy! My favorite is the nachos. On Mondays they have $1 sliders which are my second favorite.
Update: I just ordered and ate the soppapilla sunday. This is my new favorite thing!! It is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, just never thought to write a review. As a Native New Mexican when I found this place it was like heaven on earth, knowing I wouldn't have to go back home to get the tastes I grew up with. The only draw back to this place is the size. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who truly can appreciate New Mexico cuisine. Why? Because Roberto's sucks!

***Update***

Yes the food here is still awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I must eat at when I am in Las Vegas!  The New Mexico Hatch green Chile is awesome.  However, since the move from the tiny shop where they started to the much needed larger place it seems they had to make some sacrifices. Fortunately not with the food but the quality of customer service. 

The two girls working today seemed not too interested in their jobs unlike the 2 male servers who kept checking with me and were genuinely friendly. 

Had the green Chile breakfast burrito and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was on this side of town for a reflexology massage session and we decided to Yelp for a spot to grab some lunch after the massage. This popped up in our search and the pictures and ratings looked so good that we thought we had to give it a try. Glad we did! The missus ordered smothered fries, I had a 1/2 size  stuffed sopapillas and we opted for the one side and sopapilla combo for $3 more. Everything was delicious and the money is well worth it. Flavors are awesome, spice levels are perfect. We have a new favorite every time we are in Vegas. There is nothing like this in Colorado. :("}

I had 2 chicken taco's with rice and black beans for about $5 which isn't bad and share a margarita with my friend. I was surprised at how inexpensive everything was on the menu and look forward to trying more items.

I also enjoyed the laid back dude at the register who was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back real soon. Good Job CB!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Today trying something new, trying their tri tip sandwich. I can not wait it looks and smell superb."}
{"text":"This is a really great place. I never really tried food from New Mexico before I tried this place, but it's awesome. It's a small place with enough room for maybe 30 people or so. So I always hear the other people that are eating there saying that it reminds them of the food back home (New Mexico).
Everything there is fresh. The carlitos burrito smothered in green chili is delicious. I've had just about everything on the menu since I go there almost once a week for lunch, and everything has always been good. 
The people that work there are friendly and the place is nice and comfortable."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday for a breakfast burrito. They have never steered us wrong. We were excited to try out the new location. The previous location was very tight and not very enjoyable. This location in comparison is huge! They even have a full bar!

You enter into the lobby, and can order/pick up takeout from here. You can also enter the dining area off to the right. You place your order at the bar, and the kitchen is directly behind this. There are a lot of tables, and many windows. 

We split a bacon and chorizo breakfast burrito that was smothered in green chile. They were great and split it for us. The burrito itself was a disappointment. There were a lot of eggs, too many.  Not so much of the meat either. The bacon was limp. The chorizo was beef, and not too flavorful. It was not bad, but it was hard to find any in the burrito. The little bit of hashbrowns in there was done perfectly though. Nice and crispy. I really wish there were more of those and less eggs. The salsa...there was not depth of flavor at all. It was just heat. My husband, who cannot find any kind of salsa that is hot enough, said that it was too mild. For me, it was only heat. No real flavor. It needed some limes, maybe some salt and/or sugar. Something. Really disappointed. 

BUT, we have had great breakfast burritos here in the past, so we have not yet given up. We will come back again, and give it another try since we like this location. And yes, there are PokeStops nearby!"}
{"text":"Wow ok so when I called the guy asked me if I wanted green or red chilli and I've never heard that on a burrito.  Anyways I told him the way I wanted it and he wasn't rude but he wasn't FRIENDLY.  I went to pick up my order and it was wrong.  I told them 2 times just to make sure and when I got back to work I had corn and carrots in my burrito.  To some that may sound good but not to me.  I guess I should of asked if the rice came with that stuff but when I told them how I wanted my burrito that's how I thought it would come.  I was halfway done when I noticed the other half had no meat.  This is just my experience but I will not come back here again.  The burrito wasn't horrible but this place isn't to my liking."}
{"text":"My bf and I tried this spot the other day for the first time. When we walked in we were not greeted and their was no sign that said seat yourself, so we took a seat. This place was not busy when we walked in, it was about 4pm on a Monday. Anyhow a girl walk over and asked if we would like a drink and chips ,salsa and guacamole. We said yes to all the above. We ask for two beers, she then said we had to walk up to the bar to order ourselves. We then had to go seek out a menu. When she came back with our chips we were ready to order, she then said we had to walk up to the counter to place our food order.  Btw way the chips were covered in some kinda of dry pico and the gauc was nothing to rave about. Kinda don't know if this is like a fast food joint ?? However, we had the chicken tamale with green sauce and the frito nachos and the tortilla burger sliders. When our food came out it looked really good, but as we started to eat the disappointment sat in. The frito nachos were covered in like some Denny's canned chilli so not good but the tomatoes and lettuce was fresh. The sliders were not the best you could tell the beef was not fresh, it remined me of am/pm truck stop burgers. But the hatch chilli's on it were good. Now for the chicken tamale, i was excited for this but was let down. I cut into my first bite and it was all mesa, so i did  finally see the chicken, i then went to take another bite and then noticed a black short hair in my cheese on top of the tamale,btw this was served wet with hatch green sauce which was good ,and dressed with melted cheese and lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Now back to the hair,  so i scooped it out and set it aside in a napkin and was gonna wait to see if the girl was gonna ask how our food was. That never happened. So we were ready to
 go and had to go back to the counter to pay, at that time my bf took the hair and the uneaten tamale up their and asked to have the tamale removed from our bill which was a 40 dollar tab
 the tamle was 4bucks and some change. The manager at that time refused to do so and said that was a hair from the tamale wrap? So we paid and left, we still left a tip on the table but not sure why. My bf works in fine dinning and i just like to eat. We will not go back nor recommend this place. I'm giving one star because i have to in order to post this review."}
{"text":"I have a love affair with green chile. It's no secret. I would eat green chile on/in anything for every meal for the rest of my life, if I could. But not just any green chile - Hatch green chile from New Mexico. There just isn't anything that compares. And Carlito's gets it right.

Their burritos are huge, their stuffed sopaipillas monstrous. You can get a margarita for $3, finish off your meal w/ a flaky sopaipilla w/ honey. But that chile man... that chile. \"Smother\" whatever you order with it for a buck. It just occurred to me, I wonder if I could get it \"double-smothered\" for $2...

I've also been impressed with some of their daily specials, everything from pit-roasted prime rib and tri-tip steak w/ green chile to green chile and pepperoni pizza. 

My absolute favorite thing about Carlito's, however, is that I can attempt to live my dream of green chile every day by purchasing 60 lbs of Hatch chiles from them every August. That's right: Carlito's purchases 40,000+ lbs of chiles, direct from Hatch, NM, and will sell them to YOU. You can even have them roasted in the parking lot for a few extra dollars. Then, take them home, set up an assembly line, and put together little \"packets\" of green chile to line your freezer with and thaw one each day. Last year we made it to April before we ran out.

Prices are typical of any large meat-filled burrito in town, but adding sides/drinks it can get a little pricier (but SO WORTH IT). Our family of 3 usually spends $35-$38 on a typical visit, and we always have leftovers.

Give it a shot, and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"My hubbys dad is from New Mexico and they are always talking about how great the green chile is from New Mexico . Well I found this place and we had to try while we were vacationing out here . Hubby ordered pork verde burrito smothered in green chile . He liked it but thought it was a bit salty . I ordered the carne adovada burrito smothered in green chile . I liked mine . It was a bit salty for my taste but yummy . My 7 year old ordered the chicken burrito with beans and rice . He loved his burrito . My big boy got a large Frito pie which we always hear about . He enjoyed it . But he thinks it  was a little lacking in the chile .  We also ordered some chips and guacamole . The guacamole was really good but I guess we aren't used to so much seasoning on tortilla chips . It was different but I guess my boys prefer plain tortilla chips . All in all it was a good meal ."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast burritos! The green pork with hashbrowns, scrambled eggs and cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla and all smothered in green sauce is so delicious. Their tacos are my son's favorite. And nachos are piled high with lots of toppings. This is New Mexican food based on the hatch chili. You can get red or green sauce or if you like them mixed just ask for Christmas!"}
{"text":"Just go for the tacos, a side of rice and beans, and make sure you try the sopapillas!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, but we will definitely be coming back. I had the pork verde taco, a margarita, and a sopapilla with honey, and my sister had a chicken combo burrito. Everything was absolutely delicious! I thought I wouldn't have room for the sopapilla, but I would never come here and not have one! The guy was super polite and gave us the sopapilla to try since it was our first time here. It was really busy for a Tuesday evening, but we didn't wait long for our food. My only complaint is that it was really hot and I was sweating in my seat!"}
{"text":"Anything adovada.. that's all ya need to know. Their other meat is good too... but that adovada is godfood. Mmmmm so friggn good. Great margaritas too. Oh and the green chili dips great too... although i prefer it with fries instead of chips."}

I bought a adobava \"navajo taco\", rice,beans, sopapilla, and a soda.  The total was around $10.  It wasn't that great of a value.  The meat was really good.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  The refried beans were really dry, which was kinda gross.  A \"navajo taco\" is apparently some sort of flat bread thing.  It was okay, but I think I'd rather just have a normal corn tortilla.  All in all the place is alright, but I don't feel I got my money's worth.

Edit: From 3 to 5 stars.  I was young and dumb when I wrote that review above.  While I'm still not into the navajo taco or the combo deal, there are a couple of items that are simply amazing that I love.

The carlitos special burrito is great.  Just meat and sauce.  No beans, no lettuce (which doesn't belong on a burrito anyways), no rice (which also never belongs on a burrito).  Gotta get it covered with sauce and cheese.  Both the red sauce and the green sauce have an appropriate amount of kick that makes it spicy but not overbearing.  I usually end up with the pork verde when doing the burrito.

The nachos are the best nachos I've ever had in my life.  The chips are seasoned with this stuff I can't explain.  They go real easy on the refried beans.  Guacamole is great.  There's a touch of sauce in there too (can't remember if red or green) which gives the occasional burst of spice.  No lettuce (doesn't belong on there anyways).  I usually get the steak which are good sized chunks and flavorful.  The best part is that they somehow found a way to get cheese on every bite.  Melted gooey/clumpy cheese.....yummmm"}
{"text":"Been coming for years and LOVE this restaurant: and word to the wise, get yourself a Margarita, it's the best West of Santa Fe!!!  Pork Verde incredible, btw!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting Carlitos since it was at Pecos and Patrick. I am glad they expanded, but they are a bit farther from work. Luckily, not too far. I recommend many restaurants and hangouts to my adult students. This place is always a hit. It is a bit tricky to find the first visit. I tell people it is behind Joe's crab shack. They have awesome tacos, burritos and sopapillas. They also have 5% discount if you are local and register your phone number."}
{"text":"Three words.....WE LOVE CARLITO'S !!!    Three more words.....AUTHENTIC, YUMMIE, FILLING !!!   We found this Restaurant, on line.   We ordered online, via GrubHub.  The young deliveryman was polite and had a sweet smile.  They were Earlier than stated; always nice.  Carlito's is our ONLY Mexican food place that we will order from, now.  We got lucky and found THE BEST !!!  THANK YOU CARLITO's !!!   Please don't ever change, in any way.  Excellente !!!   :-)   :-)       :-*   We also APPRECIATE you getting our order EXACTLY as ordered !   xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxooxoxoxoxoxoxooxoxoxoxoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"Carlito's is not your typical Mexican joint, but it is not Mexican, it is New Mexican and that makes all the difference in the world. I am a huge fan of New Mexican food. When Carlito's opened up, I was so very excited that I could get some authentic green chile and real deal Navajo tacos. After my first visit, I was not disapointed. Since that first visit almost 6 months ago, the wife and I have been back many times, and the food always continues to satisfy. I typically get the Navajo Taco or stuffed sopapilla minus meat. The beans are always great, the rice is fantastic, and frybread/sopapilla's are delightful. The green chile varies in heat each time, but the fact that it is New Mexican green chile that is either fresh or frozen fresh makes it all good. We've recommended Carlito's to many friends, and all our meat eating friends say that the pork and beef are both very good. We also like the $1 drafts and I don't really care if its not a fancy beer, its good, cold and goes well with the food. The margs are also good for the price. The staff at Carlito's is great, always friendly and they remember who you are if you've been there more than twice."}
{"text":"I had one of the breakfast burritos from here, it was really good. However upon returning for an actual smothered burrito, it was terrible. If I wanted fake mexican food I'd go to Rubio's. Sorry guys. Good service though."}
{"text":"The Green Chile Stew was ok. Nothing to write home about. Could have used more potato in it and no where near as salty as the other dishes I had that day. Still had a few stems in it so."}
{"text":"I love this place! 
I've eaten at this place several times for lunch when I worked on the east side of town and have never been disappointed. The burritos are Huge!. I've taken my son and daughter in law and they loved it too. They've gone back and said their breakfast burritos are the \"bomb\". I so wish there was one on the west side."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place because we were told it was a lot like El Modelo in Albuquerque. While it had stuffed sopapillas and authentic roasted New Mexico Chile, 2 whole stuffed sopapillas, 1 pork and 1 steak, and a soda cost us $30 here, should've been $15-20. Besides the price, atmosphere was nice, place was clean. Food tasted good, but Mexican food that's $15/plate without a server should have more pizzazz, or quantity. We are the whole thing and we were still hungry. Their frozen bags of chile were $30/pound, we get ours from Albertsons for a lot less, from the same valley in New Mexico."}
{"text":"Where to start?

Everything from the Carlito's burrito or Navajo Tacos to the Green Chili Stew and Sopapillas  is great.

Again, everything is made to order, so there is almost always a wait, but it is well worth it.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The take out for Carlito's burritos is not the best but the dine in is amazing. Carlito's burritos messed you my burrito AGAIN. I love that place with my whole heart but they literally just put beans in my burrito. NO guac,NO rice,NO red sauce and NO cilantro.  I hate to say this but I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"Menu not extensive enough. No free chips and salsa, say what! Margaritas are $5 each, small glasses. Move out of your high-rent space, find somewhere cheaper. Then you could afford to offer/give more. Staff very nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has perfect Mexican food! I like the Tortilla burger and my parents like meat burrito."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. My husband is from New Mexico and couldn't get here fast enough once we learned of this place. I was excited as well since I learned to appreciate the Hatch chile on visits to New Mexico.

This little restaurant is packed pretty much all the time which isn't shocking if you've had the food. The people that work here start to remember you and that is refreshing in an anonymous town like Las Vegas. One Saturday I arrived after the rib special was sold out and the woman working here remembered me the next week and made sure I got one of the specials.

The food is the real attraction though. My favorite thing here is the Saturday night special which is Red Chile Adovada ribs with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas. I love to pair this with the $3 margarita. Seriously, the margarita is $3 and it packs some punch. We also love the Frito Pie which is big enough for two. If you're familiar with Green Chile Stew then you should try it here because it won't disappoint. It packs the heat that Green Chile Stew should have."}
{"text":"I like this place because it has New Mexican decorations and it very nice little hole in the wall. The food looked very good, even though I shared a platter of Carne Adovada and it was perfect.

I will hit it up again for sure :)

I really like that they give you sopapillas with honey too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day. I had been here several times before and I am never disappointed. I had the chile relleno ... and man I can not stop thinking about... I told my fiancé that I need to take her there because she would love this place. Service is amazing. Food is always amazing. Staff is friendly. Will come back and will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I would like to share my experience I had at Carlito's Burrito today.  I ordered Steak Carlito's Burrito and paid $9.03 in total. This was my first visit and I sat at the bar watching them prepare my burrito, not sure what had happened but the guy made some sort of mistake making my burrito, so he took the whole burrito apart and threw away the tortilla in the trash and then took another tortilla to put the same filling from the other burrito, the done product burrito was a size at Roberto's!  

I read and heard a lot of good things about Carlito's Burrito and gave it a try today. What a disappointment and for the price they charge it was an awful experience. Absolutely a disaster is that the way you make a burrito and charge people $9.03.  

I guess after a while any good place goes down the drain if you don't keep up the quality and good service.

Unhappy customer!


Response to Dave,

Dave,

My first experience paying exorbitant price for a burrito that was mediocre is unacceptable. Every unsatisfactory comment I read on Yelp about Carlito's Burrito, you tend to justify your errors. I have no objections giving you a second chance if you can spot me and others on Yelp on our next trip! Money unfortunately does not grow on a tree for us to fill your pocket. 

When I pay plush price for a burrito, I do not want to hear about your process all I expect is quality food serviced, which was utterly not the case in my experience.

Here is what you need to comprehend; stop making excuses for serving dissatisfactory food instead find solution to not have a customer leave your restaurant unhappy."}
{"text":"We have been in Henderson for years and never know about this place until we met a vendor from Utah who said it was his favorite. Their not so secret ingredient, New Mexico chilies. Nothing like them (they also sell the chilies.) Sunday is breakfast burrito BOGO day and they seem to be busy most of the day. My personal favorite is bacon and chorizo. They don't skimp on the meat. Speaking of New Mexico treats, finally found a place to get sopapillas, those little fried bits of goodness. Cinnamon and sugar is incredible. Good service and dare I say perhaps some of the best burritos in town..."}
{"text":"Hoppin on Sundays! 2-for-1 brekkie burritos!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food around, not to mention best Micheladas ever. If you like spicy this is the place to go, if you don't like spicy they can do that too. Everyone here is so nice and frendliy. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Can't say that enough! Greeted upon entering establishment with nothing but pure smiles and great hospitality. Ordered the Pork Verde Smothered Burrito with double meat and rice. Fantastic to say the least. Completely satisfied! Highly recommend. Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Update because I have an obsession with Carlito's Burritos now. 

Since having Carlito's many moons ago I have since been back quite a few times regularly, at least once a week, maybe missing a week in between a few times. But this has definitely become a go-to establishment for me now. I must admit, I think it had replaced my Chipotle cravings! Chipotle is completely different from this place though.

First off always get the calabacitas in whatever you order, if you don't then you might as well go somewhere else - they are the point of this place. The green/red chili sauces are also phenomenal, but the calabacitas are what you come here for. I always get them in my burritos (my natural go-to). I have had the steak (tender, often charred just a bit), the chicken, and of course, the best, the adovada pork. 

You have the option to get your burrito smothered, which I have done once, but never again. It is not my thing, but others may like this option. The green chili sauce has a KICK and the red is pleasantly spicy. 

The service is always good and the employees are nice. The place is small, so be prepared to wiggle through tables and possibly not be able to eat in the restaurant if it's packed. I suggest eating at the small bar area if you are alone or only with another person. This way you get to watch the cooks because the kitchen is completely open and you can see everything getting cooked and served up.

This is awesome New Mexican cuisine. Don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"One thing worth missing about Albuquerque is the food. This restaurant brings the unique New Mexican cuisine I love to the city I love."}
{"text":"Carlito's was disappointing, first thing I noticed when I walked in the door was that the menu items were misspelled for example \"Pozole\" was spelled \"Posole\" I knew we were in trouble! dun, dun, dunnnn! The sopapilla tasted bland. No flavor, no texture, nothing. I would've enjoyed a KFC biscuit a lot better. My girlfriend was having hot flashes in the smoldering restaurant. The New Mexican art they had on the walls were tacky and not art. From Mexico with love :)"}
{"text":"I was at your establishment Monday at 5:30 Pm
I can can give you discription of the three employees that kept walking past me while I stood at your counter if you like, since I apparently had time on my hands."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was a year ago, and this older
Gentleman claimed to be the father of the owner. He was a nice man who I wished was there when I visited this past week. They're known for there burritos, but Last year there Pozole New Mexico style was amazing! This time around it wasn't as good but it was decent. Trust me I'll be back again, Next time I'll definitely try a burrito! Take a drive away from the strip and.eat here if you are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is a very small restaurant. Had the stuffed sopapilla with carne adovada and smothered in green sauce . It was amazing! It was enough for two people The green sauce had just the right amount of heat  Everything was fresh and homemade Very friendly staff, clean. They even have Margaritas!"}
{"text":"All I can say is delicious !! Can't wait to come back and try different items. Pork burrito was the best prom burrito I have ever had and the chili verde also"}
{"text":"Dive bar/food counter that makes some seriously flavorful New Mexican eats.  Small bar/counter and a few tables crammed into a strip mall.  They have cheap tap beers too if you are so inclined. The burritos are enormous and the red chili sauce is hot hot hot!  My buddy swears by this place, and I'm a fan too.  Too bad it's not further south so it didn't take so long to grab a burrito."}
{"text":"You can't find New Mexico faire like this place.  Amazing, amazing, amazing!  Carne Adovada Sopapilla FTW!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and I have to say that every meal I have had, that it gets better every time!!! I normally have a breakfast burrito, but ventured outside my taste bud comfort zone today to have the \"Stuffed Sopapilla.\"  Smothered in hatch green chile sauce with melted cheese and filled with chile verde with a hefty helping of rice and beans, it was certainly nap time after that.  So many places get chile verde wrong. Whether the meat is too tough, or the flavor isn't right, this place nails it!  I love the new location as well.  I also want to deliver a shoutout to the chips with salsa and guacamole prior to the arrival of lunch heaven.....thanks Carlitos for exceeding expectation every time."}
{"text":"Love the food. Haven't been here for a long time and they have new waitress/cashier and they just don't listen very well to customers orders."}
{"text":"The real deal. If you're tired of chili verde made with tomatillos then you have to go to Carlitos Burritos. OH MY GOD! A combo burrito smothered with chili verde and cheese with a margarita for $11 and change. Are you kidding? The food is New Mexico/Colorado style...finally a restaurant locally that makes awesome Mexican food."}
{"text":"Gracias.  Finally we can get real green chile.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Favorite burrito place in Vegas.  Anything you order is delicious. Breakfast burritos are bomb. Owner and staff are friendly. It's a small place but it's seems like everyone in the restaurant,(patrons and staff), are friendly and happy. You can only find such an ambiance in restaurants that serve excellent food."}
{"text":"These food was delicious, the staff was friendly and the service was quick. You order at the counter and then sit down for them to bring you your food. They have a soda machine with a million different flavors, a full bar, and a big selection of beers & wine. We ordered the large chips which was enough for 4 people, beans & cheese dip h some salsa. It was standard restaurant salsa which was delicious & chunky. I had the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked. My husband had the wet steak burrito with fire roasted peppers. It was great. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. I had the enchiladas with rice and beans. Tasted good a little on the spicey side. Kind of small could've been bigger. Good  service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And a lot more reasonably priced than I first thought. I only heard about this place from Marianne Y last month during Sloppi Jo's debut. I was happy to find out that it's close to work.

I went with a Pork Verde Combo Burrito for $4.95 and chose to have it smothered in sauce for an extra $1. The guy warned me that the Pork Verde is spicy, but I was good with that. For $3, you can add a Sopapilla and two sides. I wanted to try their Green Chile Stew and compare it to Sloppi Jo's, so I ordered the Sopapilla, the stew, and some rice.

When I got back to work, I first dug into the stew. The heat hit me right away. It was almost overwhelming, but I soon acclimated and the flavor came through. I think I give the slight edge to Jolene's Green Chile Chicken Stew, but I would certainly get Carlito's version again. The burrito was spicy, but I think the stew had already seasoned me to the heat by then. At $5, the burrito is huge and definitely value for money. I only ate half of it and am saving the other half for tomorrow. As for the Sopapilla, I was impressed at how soft and fluffy it was. It came plain and yet it was somehow still delicious and totally addicting. I dipped it in the burrito's sauce until I reached the very last tasty morsel.

I hate it when I have high expectations for a place and it doesn't shine. I always feel like my disappointment is due to my inflated anticipation. I'm extremely glad this isn't the case with Carlito's. I do declare that I have a new lunch destination in my regular rotation!

Update: I just ate the rest of the burrito and noticed a couple of honey packets in the bag. Oops. Those are probably for the Sopapilla. Oh well. It was delcious all by itself!"}
{"text":"update: we love this place for its fajita friday!  great value and a fun place to get together with a few friends."}
{"text":"Being going here for several years. Food seemed better in the of location. The last few times the lady taking the orders has been kind of abrupt, not into warm and friendly. The food is still good but it seems a little pricey for what you get. The lunch for two of us was solidly above $30. I probably won't go here unless I'm going with someone who wants me to go with them."}
{"text":"This small, casual restaurant serves authentic New Mexican fare so I ordered two breakfast burritos to go.  The super-sized burritos were filled with scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar cheese and your choice of red or green chili sauce, I chose Christmas style.  The filling in the burritos was on the greasy side and neither of us enjoyed our Carlito experience.  I used a 2/1 coupon found in the R-J"}
{"text":"This place is very run down and not clean at all. The food was ok I had their chile verde burrito and ive had way better in other places. I also ordered pozole and I swear it was the most bland pozole in the world. The only thing that came out good was the eggs with bacon and string fries that my daughter ordered she loved them. One last thing is that the cashier that was there in the morning was a sweetheart she put a big smile on my daughters face lol...."}

{"text":"From start to finish this place was bomb.com!! As a native New Mexican I was def impressed with what they offered. The staff was friendly and helpful as well! I didn't have to wait long at all for my food and drinks. You do have to order at the counter and the food will be brought to you(no waitress).. The only complaint I do have is that the place is small and a lil hidden but other than that, 5 stars all the way!!!!"}
{"text":"love the wet burritos with the green sauce.  I like it better than the red sauce. Good the next day too as it is a huge portion.  The Navajo tacos are good but only for dine in. It gets soggy when you take it home."}

{"text":"Came here to get lunch for the crew. Called in the order and the lady was super nice and friendly. They seemed to be very busy. I got there and the counter lady was super nice and I appreciated the Latino treatment like \"mijo\" lol. The food was great. It's New Mexican style food so it's always so flavorful. They sell beer and other stuff. Their sit down area is nice. I recommend this place... Get the smothered burrito! Yum"}
{"text":"finally New Mexican food in las vegas. If you are from the land of enchantment you know what i mean. sopapillas, hatch chile's, and lots of it. Green or Red? you know what I mean. just go and eat. then go back and get the green chile sliders!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food way overpriced and really not good. The service though.. it was like I was bothering the workers when I walked in to sit and eat. Then the server chose the sides for me.. didn't even bother telling me I had a choice.. the smothered burrito was $13.50.. it was TINY and only had a little meat inside.. nothing else just meat.. still don't understand how they get away charging that much. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent burrito and service. They also sell Hatch Green Chili in tubs so you can take it home and cook with it. Very excited!!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh Carlitos!! You've come a long way since I first had your food 4 years ago. Carlitos started on sunset near the airport and was a tiny shop and now they've grown into a full on restaurant with a bar too! Way to go. Now on to the food!! Definitely get the smothered burrito with green sauce:D that sauce has a kick to it but its a good kind of spice. Get the combo with the sopapilla and eat that with honey. My other go to are the steak nachos. I can keep munching on that all day. Side note: you can get both red and green Chile on your burrito or nachos for a just in between kick to your meal. They also have a loyalty program too... which I need to figure out what my points get me lol. They also have cash back on Yelp! So it's a win win, tummy is happy and wallet is happy because I get some cash back!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, and tasty tastes. If and when they ever expand I will send everyone there. Until then, I won't, because I want there to be room enough to sit next to my woman."}
{"text":"I finally got a real meal at Carlito's (after visiting for some margaritas, chips n salsa and legumbres many months ago -- all of these things were very good).  I confirmed which items were vegan with the owner via e-mail (most stuff - beans, veg, rice, sopapillas, chile sauces).  So basically you have a great variety of vegetarian choices and a good variety of vegan options here.  And the meat looks pretty good from what I've observed but not tried.

Ok, so let's keep in mind that this is NEW Mexican food.  Not Mexican.  Not tex-mex.  It's not supposed to taste exactly like Mexican food.  And it doesn't! It definitely has it's own character.

I got a burrito w/ beans, rice, calabacitas, and green chile sauce.  It was gigantic! Pretty tasty too.  But the real star of the day was the sopapilla.  OMFG, how has this not been a part of my life?! Light, pillowy pockets of dough that are toothsome yet melt in your mouth as you chew.  I'm in love!!  If nothing else, do yourself a huge favor and go try a sopapilla.  If you don't like it, call me and I will come finish it for you."}
{"text":"Carlito's is a very unique restaurant with familiar items on the menu.  The new mexican cuisine is based on mexican food, but with inspirations from native american and southern cuisines.  I have been here many times, and have many favorites on the menu.  The carlito's burrito is a large burrito with only meat, and red or green chile.  The grilled steak burrito with green chile is my favorite.  The green chile is bold and flavorful, and the steak is grilled fresh to order and cut into big, tender slices.  
The tacos are another favorite of mine.  I usually get the grilled steak tacos, but the chicken and the ground beef are also very good.  The tacos are fried slightly to make the tortilla crispy.  The only criticism of the tacos is that they are served with a very small amount of salsa.  
The specials at Carlito's are also very cool.  Tuesdays is Taco Tuesday where they serve tacos for only a buck.  They have an everyday special for their Carlito's Beer which is also only a buck.  Their best special, though, is on saturdays.  Every saturday they serve a 10 oz. Ribeye Steak with cheese, green chile, mashed potatoes, and calabacitas (squash, corn, and tomato succotash).  This ribeye is only 10.95.  
Overall, if you enjoy unique new mexican cuisine, you should definitely try carlito's."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this place.  It looked like an awesome hole-in-the-wall type setting with authentic New Mexican food, but the quality simply didn't deliver.

Menu options were robust, props for having Fry Bread on the menu.  I went for a Carlito's Steak burrito instead, with their famous salsa verde.

The Salsa, instead of being deeply flavorful and robust, came off as thin and excessively salty.  The steak pieces were rubbery and tough, and tasted like they had been boiled instead of fire grilled.

Wish I could say better, but it simply wasn't the case.  Their menu items are tempting enough that i may go back and try something else."}
{"text":"We were very excited to eat here today after reading the reviews. We got chips and salsa which was $2.75. The chips were stale and kinda nasty. The salsa was in a tiny cup. Not worth the 75 cents I paid for it.  I ordered the steak burrito smothered with both red and green and sour cream, the steak was flavorless and burnt. The sauces were not good at all....My husband got a chicken tamale which unfortunately was mostly Masa and had zero flavor of what little meat there was.  Very disappointing.....Then ground beef enchiladas with green sauce. He says the enchilada was ok, but the sauce was nasty. Left a bad taste in your mouth. The food was edible, mostly.  The one bright point of our meal was the food came out fast and the Pepsi was fabulous 
  So to sum up, I will probably never go back, as we tried 4 different things and they were not very good.... I'm trying to figure out if the others that left 5 stars have no taste buds or went to a different place with the same name?? It's a mystery to me. We went on Monday the 20th of March"}
{"text":"Feels like I'm back home in Carlsbad, New Mexico. My only complaint is I wish they had a location closer. Breakfast burrito Green Chile Stew Enchiladas posole you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed food was very surprised by the amount of people that were at the location. Great taco Tuesday idea, felt warm and friendly. Had two $1 tacos and 2 carne asada. I will def be going back to dine in and request hotter salsa! Lots of flavor and felt like home"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I used to get their taco tuesday special all The time when they were located on Pecos as it was right around the corner.  I've only been once since they moved, but it's not because the quality has suffered but rather that the prices went up. Tacos are no longer $1 on tuesdays :( I understand that moving to the new location probably cost a lot of money so raising the prices was probably necessary. And I will certainly go back eventually.  It's just that I'm on a budget right now and since extreme value is what attracted me to this place and its changed a bit it's just not really on my radar right now.  However based on taste alone this place is in credible. Their sauces are so good. I've actually only had their vegetarian tacos and those were so so good! I got them loaded with refried beans black beans squash rice and all the fixings.  I will definitely go try other items eventually"}
{"text":"First time here. Big fans of NM cuisine. Lived four years in Albuquerque and loved the food. Searched for NM food in LV while visiting and made the drive from the strip. Not disappointed...authentic red and green chile...fantastic. Will definitely visit again. Recommend huevos rancheros with carne adovada for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for a long time.  We decided to hit it up the other night and I see what I have been missing.  My wife had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and my friend and I shared a sopapilla with pork chile verde with green sauce and a chorizo burrito christmas style.  I don't like spicy food but this was just the perfect amount of hot for me.  Not too spicy but just enough to get me to sweat a little bit.  Every single dish was delicious.  The pork was so tender and flavorful.  Both the red and green sauces were great!  And, they have $1 beers all the time.  Are you kidding me?  This place is a great spot to get some delicious (New) Mexican food and grab some cheap brews!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food. Very flavorful and the portions are plenty. I'd come here a lot more if it was in my side of town. So when I'm on this side of town, I make sure I stop by and get some great food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped in today before our trip to Ca. I am definitely a regular. My favorite is their breakfast burrito smothered woth green sauce. Yum"}
{"text":"Holy Guacamole Batman...  This place ROCKS!!!!  I was totally tempted by Jaime W's ROTD for this place and so I had to go ASAP.  I was Sooooo NOT disappointed!!  My stud muffin had some errands to run so as luck would have it we were on the other side of the universe from where we live which just so happened to be RIGHT BY CARLITO'S!!  Serendipitous! So we walk in and the place is small but PACKED!!  That's a good sign.  You could tell that these were ALL REGULARS too.  I saunter on up to the little counter staring at the menu overhead trying desperately to remember what I had decided I wanted to try.  I couldn't remember so I just told the guy that it was our first time and asked him what was the best thing they had.  He asked us if we like spicy and WE DO so he suggested the Chili Verde Burrito.... I got it Combo which is beans and rice and Eric (aka stud muffin, studster, baby maker, hubster, etc) got it Carlito's Way which is double meat.  My son ordered the chicken Nachos. (All three lunches with drinks plus tax & tip came out to under $30.) The service was fast and friendly!

When the food arrived (which was quickly despite being very busy) we were first impressed by the shear SIZE of the portions... HUGE!  More than enough to fill up my teenage son who can easily eat a large pizza by himself!!  The nachos are piled HIGH with everything you can imagine and the chicken is SO GOOD!!!  TONS OF FLAVOR!!!  Our Burritos were so big and smothered in green sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug in and both immediately started making noises you would normally hear coming from a bedroom but it was sooo good we couldn't help it!!  Just the right amount of hot without losing any of the flavor.  OH. SO. GOOD!  I still have half of mine left and will be having it for dinner tonight!!

I am a definite FAN of Carlito's!! There is not one thing negative I have to say about this place.  It is exactly what it should be.   So my taste buds and  tummy send many thanks Carlito's and to Jaime W for sending me there!!"}
{"text":"Doing some house sitting in Henderson and yelped up something near me.  Noticed the 4 stars and the \"New Mexico\" style cooking which I have never had.

The food was great.... I did a pork burrito.  Big junks of pork, home style... Makes me really wish I did steak though being the pork was that good....

Would have been 5 stars but the rice and beans were cold....  I should have said something but  everything looked so good I let it slide.

A few other points...

First off the staff was extremely nice.  Told the lady it was my first time there and to recommend and she was happy to accommodate.

Second dollar drafts!   All the time.

Third Daily Specials.!

Fourth frequent diner card!  Appreciation for repeat customers... nice

If you come across this post and consider eating here you will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"I love the food. Sauces are spicy and meats are tasty but the last few times I've been the customer service and cleanliness have been lacking. It was great when they first opened but the last time I dined in last week Friday around 11am. I was a bit put off by the bathroom and tables/floors and counters. They do have a takeout option I might consider but its scary to think how the back kitchen is kept."}
{"text":"This place is back and better than ever. Their new location is beautiful and the food quality is excellent.

My go-to item is the Breakfast Burrito with no meat (eggs, cheese, red sauce and hash browns). The hash browns make a huge difference. Most places give you potatoes, but there is something about the crunch in Carlito's breakfast burrito that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"After ordering, the wait was entirely too long, especially for just nachos. The menu needs to be a little bit more specific on exactly what is in each item and what the choices are for each item."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've driven past this place for years. They are serving up red and green New Mexican chile! First off I love Mexican but homemade chile and Indian fry bread?! My mouth is drooling as I'm writing this review. We came in just looking to grab a burrito and our cashier told us they were 2 for 1. Talk about a win win! The lady who took our order was so friendly and the way she talked to the customers you could tell they were repeat customers because she knew them by name and just has a way with people. Wish I got her name. Anyway, we ordered our burritos and took them to go and she packed it up with all the fixins as I had mentioned we were going to eat at the cemetery down the road. She put extra utensils and plenty of that delicious red and green chile and lots of napkins! I appreciated that greatly! It's the little things that matter,but into bigger things the food! My burrito was ginormous and stuffed with egg hash brown and bacon. Not bits of bacon huge pieces. At 6.75 normally priced they are definitely worth it. I could barely finish half! Smothered in green chile and cheese. Super yummy! My guy had the chorizo breakfast burrito and it wasn't that processed chorizo it was the real deal. Looked like ground beef. I will definitely be back to grab some more food next time I'm headed to the cemetery. Indian fry bread tacos?! Yes please!"}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing!  I went to the take out side!  This girl, that took my order, was amazing!  I liked her service more than the food!  I got the small nachos, and ordered a burrito for my husband.  Wow, so much toppings on my nachos, you have to eat it with a fork!  It had that old fashion Mexican food taste.  The chips were fried in house!  It was really good.  My husband really liked his burrito as well.  I could see us coming back in the future!  Specially right before a movie at the Galaxy Theater, this place is in the same shopping center, behind Joe's Crab Shack!  My GPS, had me doing circles!"}
{"text":"Green hatch chile...Yaaaassss!!!! The first time I was introduced to this place, I had a third of their bacon and egg breakfast burrito that was shared amongst co workers. This burrito was HUGE and smothered with green chile. I've never had a desire to visit New Mexico but it is now on my list of desired places to visit just from tasting what I've been missing out on. I took two other visits since that first taste and have not been disappointed. I have even ventured off to try their smothered fries with red chile...delicious!! This place is GREAT!!! The staff is extremely friendly, it gives you a feeling of not being in a big city like Vegas anymore but in some kind of small friendly town. The one and ONLY reason for giving Carlito's 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the restaurant itself is so tiny!! My immediate local family could fill that place up easily. A restaurant this delicious and friendly never stays empty so consider that as a warning if you're expecting to for sure have some place to dine in. Ooh and please don't let me forget to mention the $3 tall glass margaritas!!! If beer is your preference, they have that also. What else can you ask for."}
{"text":"Solid food but not amazing.

The restaurant's biggest problem is its strange set-up. Carlitos's shares a dining room with Live-Fire-Q. It makes a first visit unnecessarily confusing--there are multiple counters, no clarity about whether in-restaurant customers should order at the counter or sit, and a combined menu that looks too big for one kitchen to manage.

The good news is that Carlito's and Live-Fire-Q seem to have separate kitchens, making the menu manageable even if the dining room comes off as confused about its identity.

I tried the chicken enchilada with red sauce, figuring it is a staple and would give me a good sense of the place. The sauce was tasty; the chicken cooked perfectly well. Very standard. Nothing mind-blowing.

The same was true of my rice--good but not amazing. The black beans were the highlight--a beautiful color, cooked to be firm but definitely cooked through, delicious.

I wouldn't object to a friend suggesting this place, but I doubt I'll be back on my own."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Well at least the breakfast burrito with everything and smothered in green chile is. Can't speak for anything else because that's the only thing I get here. I'm from new mexico and this is the only spot in vegas that can compete. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. Great upgrade from the last spot. If you want something spicy come try the infamous hatch green chile! It's well worth it. 10 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm came for the soft grand opening of the new location for Carlito's Burrito.
The spot is a lot bigger than the old location, so that's good.  

Based upon the reviews, I had to try the smothered Green Chile Verde Pork burrito. 
I came to the conclusion that there has to be something else people are eating that makes this place rave because this just tastes meh! to me. It really is spicy and the pork is cooked well, but there is no depth to this burrito. I also felt the it had an excessive amount of salt, which probably drowned lot of the natural flavor.  

I may go back to try another item on the menu, but this one didn't work out for me."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     18/100

After seeing a friend's (Micah O.) photos, of the smothered burritos and constant check-ins for this place, I just had to try this place out! 

The smothered burritos are what lured me in. I want. I needed it in my belly. 

I wanted to try the burrito (the normal way) but I'm currently on a low carb diet (health reasons) so I got the Pork Verde Burrito Bowl with Green Chile Sauce and everything on it. I asked for no rice and all black beans. It also came with corn and sliced squash. Which was great because I love squash. 

I didn't know how hot the chile would be so I stuck with the green. She said they didn't make it too hot today, so she recommended the green. I didn't want to risk getting something too spicy so I went with the green. The green was mild, no spice (at least for my taste). I wish I had gotten the red sauce too! Next time I will definitely get the red! I added Tapatio, but it clearly needed the red chile sauce. 

The pork was tender and flavorful. I really liked it. 

Next time, I will get it with both sauces and I will try what my friend recommended, the breakfast burrito. His recommendation is get it with both red and green sauces, with everything on it. 

My friend got the steak bowl, I tried a piece, it was tender and okay flavor wise for me. My friend enjoyed it. I still preferred the pork. I will have to try the other meat choices next time. 

Also, the way it is set up, you order and pay at the counter first, then they give you an order number and bring the food to you.  

The lady at the cash register (I think her name was Debbie) was kind and very helpful with questions for us newbies. For me, the customer service is what makes or breaks a place.

Another lady was the one that brought the food to us and got our order numbers mixed up, no big deal, but she needs to get on top of that. 

The restaurant is clean, well decorated and spacious. Women's bathroom at the time I went, one stall was out of toilet paper and no paper towels in both dispensers. 

Looking forward to trying other items on the menu. 

All in all, I really like this place and prefer it compared to some other Mexican restaurants. As far as burritos are concerned, this place is on point.

TIP: P.S. SUNDAYS - Burritos are buy one get one free! 
Happy Hour - Monday-Thursday 3-6pm!"}
{"text":"I love the unique flavors that are offered at Carlito's burritos. Green chilies are delicious and they incorporate them into a sauce that is the perfect combination of flavor and heat. 
The fry bread is great. If you don't order the Navajo taco.... for sure get the cinnamon sugar fry bread as a dessert"}
{"text":"Where has Carlitos gone.  In the last 4 months have seen a steady decline in food quality and service.  If the keep going like this it will close and what a shame.  Navajo taco brought out cold and when I aske for the meat to be hot the cook miked it all together in to slop."}
{"text":"Carlito's is an incredible place to get your fix on NEW MEXICAN food.  As this cuisine is, it is pretty spicy, not the healthiest, and tastes awesome.  The new location is much nicer than the old, the staff is nice, and the food is outstanding.  Portions are very generous, and I very much like the ability to add the two sides to an entre, which they are wonderful as well.  My favorites here are the Posole, Green Chile Stew, Legumbre's which are I am pretty sure par boiled carrots, jicama and cucumber in chili and lime, and anything with any of the meats in it.  Probably the stuffed sopapila is my favorite.  Also the Juevos Rancheros are the best I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor and GO!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but I am so disappointed in the fact that you have to pay for chips and salsa and then, the portions are tiny! What a slap in the face to anyone who appreciates good Mexican food, to have such stingy and over priced portions! The guacamole is also served in a condiment size cup.

Fajitas; flavorful, Indian taco great, red sauce on the enchiladas almost perfect........

Set up a salsa bar or serve complimentary chips and salsa, increase the serving size of the guacamole and you'd get a 5 star rating. You've got to realize that beverage sales increase as salty chips are consumed."}
{"text":"The green hatch chili was awesome.  I had the green cheese enchiladas.  Now I need to go to New Mexico.  But it would be a lot easier to stay in Vegas and eat here."}
{"text":"EATING BAD!!!  Just like eating at my favorite hang-outs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe or Los Alamos.  The BEST New Mexican place in town.  Wait..The ONLY true New Mexican place in town.  Eat there as often as I can, which is never enough.  If you are true fan of NM cooking, Carlito's is the place.

I love their Breakfast Burritos. I get sausage, fully loaded, smothered in Red sauce.  Muy bueno!  Their tacos al pastor are my favorite for lunches and the carne adovada enchiladas for dinner.  As good as you can find anywhere....all made on the spot.  I also will get their chicken enchiladas with Green, which are also excellent.

They even make their sopapillas the right way.  Not sprinkled with powdered sugar and choc syrup, but just served with honey, fresh, light, sooooo good.

Sign up for their email so you know when they grill ribs and tri-tip in their parking lot.

Staff is always great (keep it up Dave) and much success.

Oh...they are the only Green Chile roaster in town every August.  That little insult Whole Foods does is a joke.  Carlito's roasts by the sack at good prices.  Can't wait."}
{"text":"From the moment you enter this, small seemingly \"hole in the wall\" place, your olfactory senses will launch into overdrive.  Carlito's Burritos smells just as good as it tastes - a rare feat in many Las Vegas restaurants I've visited.  

The food at their current location (Pecos and Patrick - note: they are moving soon to Sunset and Athenian Dr.) is delicious.  On my first visit I ordered, I guess their signature dish - the Carlito's Burrito, a massive flour tortilla stuffed with pork verde smothered in green chili (I topped it with guacamole and serrano peppers).  I also ordered a sampling of their Green Chile Stew which frankly they should bottle up and sell in mass.  More stew news in a bit.  

The Carlito's Burrito with pork verde was an explosion of flavor.  Imagine a huge flour tortilla stuffed with tender pork verde smothered with an amazing green chile sauce.  They skimped a bit on the guacamole and the serrano peppers where thrown in as a second thought.  I say, I say, just take a little care and slice your serrano peppers a little more thinly as most don't like large chunks of hot peppers.   
 
A few days later I ordered dinner for the family tackling their stuffed sopapilla, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales.  Besides the tamale the sopapilla, tacos, and enchiladas were met with high praise and thankful taste buds.  The tamale!  Ugh!  It looked burnt, stale, old/ancient.  It didn't last past a bite.  Everything else was devoured.  

BREAKING STEW NEWS: My wife doesn't like spice.  She often frowns on many of the foods I bring home (or cook) as I often add too much spice for her liking.  On both of my visits to Carlito's Burritos I ordered their (what should be their signature dish) Green Chile Stew.  I told my wife, \"this is spicy but so delicious!\"  She ate it and ate it all.  She agreed that even though it was spicy she just couldn't stop as the flavors wouldn't allow her to.  I say this again, bottle this stuff up!  I'd buy this by the gallons (which they do allow via their catering menu!)

I'm so glad a co-worker introduced me to this place and even happier that I introduced my family to this place.  As I noted earlier they are moving.  Thankfully they are moving not far from their current location and are even opening a new BBQ place to boot too.  It is nice they have a membership diner plan that gives you discounts on future visits as I'm bound to rack the points up at this delicious place."}
{"text":"first let me say maybe I expected more-as I was a huge fan of his original spot-small-quirky-but great New Mex cuisine!
The food at the new place was on Par as always it was very good-maybe it was just the evening we were here but service was so so and overstaffed also the ambiance was just enh! I felt he could have really done some things to promote the unique New Mex Styles! However the food was great as expected."}
{"text":"Authentic New Mexico style cuisine. Excellent food, excellent prices, fantastic green and red chili from New Mexico. Simply the best in town."}
{"text":"Went there for BOGO day.  So I got a couple steak breakfast burritos.  The yummiest ever and the staff were super patient with me since it my first time."}
{"text":"My whole family is from Denver and have yet to find a place with good smothered burritos until we found this place. This is New Mexico style food done right. We drove across town just to try it after being referred to it by another Denver friend. The inside of the restaurant is small but has the total Denver/NM feel to it. I ordered the small smothered fries and I wasn't even able to finish it. We will definitely be coming back. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the green chili could have been hotter! But the $3 margaritas make up for that!"}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the smothered sopapilla. I'm a sucker for sopapillas and had never seen ran across a savory one before! While fairly tasty it was SO FREAKING SPICY I couldn't even finish half of it. Places with stuff this spicy should offer things on a spice scale like a thai place or have warning signs up! Will I be back? Probably not, but I'm not a fan of New Mexican cuisine or spicy food so this place isn't exactly up my alley. I hoped being a lover of Mexican food meant I could love New Mexican food, but this isn't the case for me."}
{"text":"Not very impressed, lousy service, I had the chile relleno burrito, never found any chile relleno. And too spicy for an average taste.
The smothered fries had good flavor but were soggy to the point of being almost un-eatable.
The frito pie was too hot with chili sauce , I only took one bite.
Everybody said it was too spicy/ hot.
No service, the guy handed 3 of us 4 menus, and seemed very uninterested that we were even there.
He also brought the three of us 4 silver settings, not sure if he could count, but he acted like we were a inconvenience.
Another issue is the glasses will not fit under the spout on the self serve fountain.
We Won't be back."}
{"text":"If you want authentic New Mexican cuisine, then this is as good as you will find West of the New Mexico border.  They serve it in a different way, but the food is really good.  This is not Mexican, nor TexMex, but pure Southwestern as defined by New Mexico.  Red and green chilie sauce, made from Hatch, NM, chilies, are excellent,  but the red is too wimpy, and needs to be heated up.  Soapapillas are heaven when served fresh from the kitchen and dosed liberally with honey.  Excellent lunch or dinner place for sure."}
{"text":"The staff today 07/18/16 are CLUELESS. The persons taking orders kept mixing up my orders. I ordered smothered fries they served me plain fries...I could've went to any fast food joint for that...."}
{"text":"So yummy and the burritos are MASSIVE!!! Plus we had an awesome waitress! She was so sweet and helpful! 

During the 5 days we stayed in Vegas we came here twice! My mom really enjoyed their food and that's saying a lot because she's a picky eater with all her medical problems. This will definitely be a place we'll have to stop by every time we come to Vegas! 



Ps~ They serve breakfast all day! :D"}
{"text":"Red or Green - this is the place!
The food is consistently great.  Look for the daily specials."}
{"text":"This place is great! Consistently good food, large portions, friendly staff, and killer specials! I've been going here so much this past year that it's becoming it's own food group! I mostly stick with the breakfast or pork verde burritos, both very good. Tacos and pasole are good as well. The only food I didn't think was that great was their \"taco salad\". The staff here are all quite friendly. They also have cheap beer! Some of their specials include 2-for-1 breakfast burritos every Sunday which is a killer deal and they make ribs on Saturday evenings which are quite tasty as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"this is a little whole in the wall that serves amazing new Mexico food.  the green and red sauce to die for.  

pros:
pork nachos.  best pork ever.  so tender and flavorful.  enough to feed 2. 

christmas style smothered fries, half red sauce, half green sauce.  

sopapillas, light airy and fluffy.  

burritos are massive.  

cons:
not very clean inside.

service:  cashiers unprofessional.  grill master, not friendly.  service is not very good.  


special ribs made on Saturdays.  ribs look amazing on the grill outside.  grill master not friendly at all. asked a few questions about the ribs and got the cold shoulder. ribs, took a bite and not tender.  flavor was good, but it was some work to get the meat off the bone.  some spots of meat were very sour, probably from the lime mixture he squirts on the meat after he take is off grill.  it killed the taste of the ribs.  not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken nachos with the works. Delicious! Each bite was filled with crunch and evenly distributed cheese. I'm not a fan of excess black olives, beans, and sour cream but I was surprised how everything had just the right amount.  Nothing was overbearing! The flavors are just the right amount of spicy and they don't skimp on cheese like others! (Cough--Robertos)
Very impressed by not only the presentation and taste, but the fair pricing. The only thing I could say bad is that I have to reheat my leftovers in another container bc the to-go is in aluminium (microwave).
This is my first time here. I want to try more dishes before giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Got a taco plate with refried beans and calabasitas -AMAZING! I will always order the calabasitas (squash) as a side from now on !! Carlitos is the best if you cannot get to NM !"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Always a little crowded but that's because the food is good. The Sopapillas are great. Worth a drive if you don't live in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and extremely disappointed. Having traveled the southwest and been back and forth from Texas through New Mexico, this is far from what I would expect. Ordered the huevos rancheros and it was practically a soup. For the price point it is very unreasonable in size and quality. Will not return. 

Also NOT a vegetarian option and expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"We are from Hawaii and stumbled upon Carlito's by accident after getting on the wrong freeway on ramp trying to go to another Mexican restaurant. Carlitos popped up on yelp as a nearby Mexican restaurant so sight unseen we decided to try it. Never heard of it before and didn't have time to read the reviews.  

We were absolutely blessed!  The counter gal was friendly, and the patrons obviously were regulars and as we stood in line, they shared with us what to order.  The comment we heard a lot was \"everything is good!\" and yes it was.  My chicken taco for $2.25 was so ono-licious (in Hawaiian that means broke-da-mouth good) and hubby's steak burrito was ono-ono-licious.  The sauce on the burrito was amazing.  

We will definitely come back again! Carlitos Burritos NO KAI OI!  (In Hawaiian that means VERY GOOD!!)"}
{"text":"For someone who claims to dislike Mexican food, my reviews sure speak differently. Carlito's Burritos are a mammoth of a meal. Being raised in Vegas, it should not come as a surprise that everything is super sized or all you can eat. With this place, their monster wrap might as well be totted as a buffet in itself. 

Katrina M. has been raving about this restaurant and the spice factor of the food. If there is one flavor that I cannot get enough of, it is spiciness. I came in ready to regret my decision, but it was more well rounded than that. Between myself and a friend, we shared a pork verde combo burrito with rice and black beans. It comes with an option to smother it. I suggest the green chile sauce because it definitely adds a distinct kick. We added a sopapilla, green chile stew, and a salad for three dollars more. I am glad that we split this meal because it would be near impossible to polish everything off by myself. For ten dollars and change, this is the most filling, high quality, and cheap meal you will be able to get.

The pork was tender and moist. The mellow flavors of the inside are accentuated by the subtly bold bite of the green chile that covers the entire burrito. The dressing for the tossed salad was too oily and lacked an acid to balance it. The green chile stew is the same as the one that we asked for on the burrito, but it was delicious enough to warrant another side. We had thought that the sopapilla had been forgotten. As I was about to speak up, they came out with the freshly fried morsel and a bottle of honey to accompany it. The bread had a nice airy quality while producing a chewy bite. I love any variations of a donut and they make one of the best. 

It is hard to continue my \"I dislike Mexican food\" stance with such high quality places such as Carlito's around."}
{"text":"We had a crew of 7 at lunch, it wasn't too busy when we arrived but by the time we left it was packed. 
Nice size restaurant, it was our first time in so it was a little confusing, they made us pay first, some of us went to sit while we poured our own drinks. By the time everyone got to the table our food was being served. They got a couple of our orders wrong, which they gladly fixed but it was difficult at times to get a waitress. Over all we liked the food. Chips were yummy with the seasoning. I got a carne adovada taco, I didn't like it the meat didn't have much flavor and even though it was in sauce it was dry. But the Shrimp Taco was the complete opposite, so good, I will get that again. I had to get a Cinnamon Sugar Sopapilla, made me smile, fluffy, warm, fresh. Shrimp tacos and sopapillas FTW!
I will return, the BBQ side should be open and I'll get to sample that as well. Hopefully they fix their glitches and thrive in their new location."}
{"text":"Many have waxed poetic about the splendor of burritos.   Statues have been erected in their honor as a token of appreciation to their flexibility of ingredients, their filling nature, and, of course, their deliciousness.  Wait, there aren't really burrito statues across the world?  We should get on that.  As a result of the existence of this amazing food invention, you trek to your local Chipotle once a week for lunch and gorge yourself silly while pointing and laughing at those across the street at Taco Bell.

Well what if I told you that there existed a place in Las Vegas that went above and beyond what you get when you visit Chipotle, Robertos, or heaven forbid Taco Bell for your burrito needs?  THIS IS THE BEST BURRITO IN LAS VEGAS   Full disclosure:  there are probably 120 other burritos I have yet to try here, but I'm not above hyperbole for my reviews.

Yes, the place is way too small and seats are way too closely spaced for their own good.   We sat in the last table for 4 available on a Friday evening and I had to eat my entire meal as if I were in a straitjacket.   I didn't care.   I ordered a Pork Verde Carlito's Burrito smothered with Green Chile and some Jalapenos on top.   You know that cliche from movies and TV shows where people eat something delicious and are constantly going \"Mmmmm\" and exclaiming how good what they're eating is?   I became that cliche.  The pork was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the flavor of the green chile smothering it will make it hard for me to ever eat another dry burrito again.   This is not a small portion either.  For $7.25 I thought the amount of amazing burrito I received was worth it's weight in gold.   Here's the kicker:  I was still hungry afterwards.   Not hungry in the sense of \"that 3 lbs of pork and chile and tortilla has left my stomach empty\", but hungry in the \"I want to eat every single thing on this menu right now\"    Everyone at my table seemed happy, though my friend who got the Frito Pie may have exploded before he made it home as none of us have ever heard from him again (kidding)

For drinks we got some margaritas to start which I found to be very weak.  Very syrupy and not enough tequila for my liking, but for $3.00 I kind of expected that.   Then I braved a Michelada because I'd never had one before and I'll try anything once.   Never again, but I was glad I tried it.   On my third choice I settled for Modelo on draft and like Goldilocks, it was juuuuust right.  

Cramped, too crowded, too chaotic, bad margaritas?   Check, check, check, check.   5 stars just for the burrito?   Yup.   Let the first burrito statue we erect in Vegas bear the name of Carlos."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place! It's really hard to find a place that has good green chili and this place I believe is the best in Vegas! 

On Tuesday they have taco taco Tuesday and tacos are only a dollar. Not to mention the tacos are delicious.  I typically order the smothered green chili combo burrito with calibacitas. Their margaritas are good here they are 3.00 I also like to order the chips and guacamole which also comes with green and red salsa (green being my favorite). The carne Asada fries are delicious too and will definitely feed two people. Every time I'm here it's busy which is a good thing in my opinion it means the food is good. The good thing is that the staff is friendly and they are quick to serve. My only complaint is they need a bigger place! If u want that New Mexican flavor this is the place to go"}
{"text":"The BEST Nachos I've EVER eaten!  They season their chips. It's perfection in a bowl. My friend had a burrito with green chilies. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch solo the other day and thought it was time to post a Yelp.  About my fifth time here.  Live and work way on the other side of town so don't get by here much.  I think it's a real gem.  I've had the Carlitto's chile verde pork burrito several times, huge and very spicy!...and all of the different tacos, with a great shell and juicy, delicious meats and toppings.  Three tacos or the burrito make for a BIG lunch or fine dinner.  The chips and salsa are expensive until you see the truckload they bring you, with a great seasoning on them.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has been on the radar for some time, we just haven't had time to try it. Today we managed to compromise, I'd eat nachos and my husband would eat his favored \"plate lunch\". 

We arrived for I thought a late lunch, around 145pm, but found a line almost out the door and hardly a seat in the place wasn't occupied. I stood in line studying the menu and when it was time to order I had added the Navajo taco to my original craving of nachos. 

I was surprised to see fry bread on the menu, and quite pleased when my order was ready. The Navajo Taco was a fry bread topped with pork Verde or carne adovada, cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes, I choose the pork verde, boy was it delicious, soft almost falling apart before I had a chance to chew it. It was just spice enough not to cause a sweat. 

My order of nachos was just the usual, they put the beans and cheese, cheddar & jack, on the bottom as well as throughout the chips, then layered with olives, scallions, tomatoes, green chile, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole and I added beef. It was a really good nacho! 

Even though my husband was going to eat a plate lunch just up the street, he couldn't resist what was before him and I think he ate as much as I did, it was a really good lunch. I will be back to try other items I spied on their menu."}
{"text":"Well once again I come into a negative situation with my dog... I wish some of these people would read the standards handbook about service animals

We were in front of a very long line and the person who is rather chubby was at the cashier register and told my girlfriend he would not even serve her clearly the dog had a vest on a marked badge so we had to go all the way to the back of the line and wait to review our order .....so disappointed"}
{"text":"Went in to order food to go last night. Placed my order and after about 15 minutes I could see what I thought were my 2 stuffed sopapillas being placed under the heating lamp. So, I decided to watch and wait... for 10 minutes.

Then the waitress bagged up our food and passed it off to me. I mentioned something to the waitress about the food being under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and she just walked away. I was gonna raise hell but after waiting for 25 minutes I wasn't going to have them remake it because they were so freaking slow in the first place and I don't like the idea of spit in my food.

I drive home, a total of 3 minutes, and found cold, gluey, gross sopapillas with congealed, greasy cheese and a complete lack of green chile. Disgusting!

Never, ever, ever again."}
{"text":"We moved here from New Mexico a few months ago, worried about where we were going to get our red and green chili fix (chile truly is addicting!). My son, who already lived here told us about Carlito's. OMG! Not only is the food they serve awesome, I can also buy chile to take home and use in my cooking. 

Carlito's definitely rewards it's return customers.If you give them your phone number when you order, they will track your purchaes, and give you $5 for every $50 you spend. We live about 15 minutes away, but we still manage to eat there 2-3 times a week, especially for the breakfast burritos, (which are delicious any time of day) and 1/2 price all day Sunday and until 11 a.m. on Wednesday."}
{"text":"So I just thought this place was OK.  We got there in the nick of time, after we ordered there were like 11 people in line to order. Good tip: don't sit in the middle of the restaurant when the line forms they are right next to you. Place is pretty small.  They have TV's with no sound but at least you can watch, my friend got the a bloody beer which looked & tasted amazing--so get one of those!  She also got some fried dough dessert thing that came w/ honey on the side, get that too!

I ordered a tortilla-less burrito [basically like a burrito salad] w/ the green chili sauce and chicken.  The chicken was pretty gross, lots of tough parts and fat, definitely not all white meat and I didn't think the highest quality I picked it out towards the end.  The black beans were under cooked and more on the 'harder side' then they should've been. I'm from Miami, I know black beans!  I ordered my co-worker chicken nachos to go.  They looked amazing, brought them back to her, she ate them, I asked her what she thought--- she said the chicken was gross too! Thank God I'm not crazy.

So my suggestion here: offer an all white meat vs mystery chicken option, I'd rather pay an extra dollar and get the good stuff.

Undecided if I will return."}
{"text":"I come on Tuesday. Tacos Tuesday to be exact. Dollar soft or hard tacos for a dollar. Dollar draft beer. Ask for green sauce and wrap your meal up with a stuff sopapilla! Come on other days too because the food here is bomb!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING. How the hell does this place have 4 stars??? 2 tacos. A burrito. A salad = $35!! No flavor. Service took forever! NO SALSA BAR. Was very disappointed with the price and food. Sorry gang, never again."}
{"text":"Went to the new location this morning and was pleased with the new spot...I chose the steak n egg quesadilla hoping for a smaller portion than the normal huge burritos they serve...I was happy with the heat of the green chiles and just right portion of proteins too...

Slightly awkward layout right now but I'm sure once they get all settled in the logistics of ordering on the LIVE FIRE Q side will make sense...

Good thing I don't live closer because I'd for sure be eating here more often!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place yesterday! It has been on my list so since me and the bf had a night off we decided to try it. It's right near my house so I was hoping for a new hangout..

It was busy when we walked in and smelled great. We ordered frito pie, a green pork tamale, 2 red enchiladas, a side of green stew, a side tossed salad and sopapilla. It took about 25 minutes for our food, and it came out cold. The frito pie was complete mush in the center, like it had been sitting for a few hours, so gross.Why would you make something like that in advance so it is mushy?? 

The enchiladas were good once you got past the sauce. The red sauce tastes like ketchup with a bit of chiles but you get a whole bunch so I guess that makes up for it. My tamale was really old, I kept trying to cut it and it was just hard all on the outside. I was sad about this, I love tamales, and it was just gross. Also, when I cut into it there was maybe a teaspoon of meat and thats it. My salad dressing was off and really sour. We decided the 20 bucks was worth finding out we didn't like it, threw our food away and went to another place close by for dinner.

The reason for the second star was that the sopapilla (which the girl forgot and I had to go up and ask for, much to her irritation, which I didn't see why she was so irritated, the other girl was doing all the work while she sat behind the counter doing her makeup) was amazing and the green chili stew was ok. 

Maybe I caught them on an off day? Maybe I just didn't order the right stuff? Cause if this is authentic New Mexico food, I feel kinda bad for people who grow up on it."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Spanish food from Albuquerque New Mexico!"}
{"text":"So good. And close by. As a Texan I like a nice thick and spicy red sauce, and they've definitely got the best in town!"}
{"text":"Okay, after visiting Albuquerque twice in the last 2 months, I was hopelessly addicted to New Mexican cuisine. BTW, it is a world of difference from Mexican cuisine okay? I was dreading coming back home to Vegas and having severe NM food jones. The 550-mile drive was also a bit severe just to get a fix.

Imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon this place!!! Oh man oh man :-))) Sheer delight when asked by cashier whether I wanted Red or Green (the only question that matters in NM) and I replied \"Christmas!\", she gave me a knowing wink & asked a follow-up, \"Smothered?\" & I nodded 'YEAH!' like a grateful puppy dog. As if I needed further affirmation, the place was filled with diners in red (t-shirts, sweatshirts etc) with Los Lobos emblazoned on. Apparently, this is the only NM cuisine place in town and I am as happy as a high desert wolf when the moon is full.

Carlito's totally rocks. Everybody who likes extra zing in their food, come on down here!!!"}
{"text":"The thing that saved this place is yes the portions are big. But the taste is not that great. Got the smothered combo burrito with adovada, and all the free toppings. Not much meat inside. Mostly beans and rice. For $9 burrito it should have more meat.

Also tried the $2 slider and the chile verde taco. The meat on all three were very tender but no flavor! Not enough seasonings. Usually if a meat is soft and tender but not enough flavor, a good salsa can save it. Their salsa tastes like Pace. 

Plus side, you get your food fast, even though they were busy. Counter staff not overly friendly or helpful though."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not sure how to rate this place at all, as my experience here is very weird.

Came here to use a restaurant.com certificate, and it turns out they stopped accepting the certificates last week, however they let me use mine this time.  

The food is very reasonably priced, until you get the upcharge for the rice, beans and sopapilla, which is not worth $3.  I would recommend not doing the upcharge.  The sopapilla is very good and I loved it, but I don't know if its worth the charge.

The food itself is good.  I had one chicken and pork tamale smothered in green sauce.  The green sauce was very spicy and good.  I normally am not crazy about chicken tamales but I liked this one much better than the pork.  My husband got cheese quesadillas (they were just ok, but good when I dipped into my green sauce), and a chicken burrito smothered in a weird tasting red sauce that my husband liked but I did not.  Some weird flavors in it that I was not familiar with.  Is this a New Mexico thing?  I'm not sure.

Now this is the kicker as to why I'm not sure how to rate this place.  We both had severe stomach problems after this meal.  I had a huge stomach ache later that night to the point to where I just about threw up, and my husband was permanently stuck in the bathroom.

So, we enjoyed our meal but I guess but our bodies didn't.  So we (obviously) will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. I'm not saying I'm an expert in New Mexican cuisine, but I have been there a few times, and this is the real deal. They were roasting Hatch chiles outside. My wife and I bought a bag while on vacation over a week ago, otherwise I would have bought more. 

In my opinion, the green sauce is the way to go. We started off with nachos full of cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeños, black olives, green onions, green chilies, and refried beans. My wife had blue corn enchiladas with a fried egg. I enjoyed Carlitos combo, with enchilada, tamale, and a taco. I noticed my wife's black beans were plain, my pinto beans had some small slivers of green Hatch chili. 

At the end of the meal we were served the sopapillas with honey but I had no room."}
{"text":"Wow..Dang! #satisfied
Serrano peppers...yes, please and thanks! 
Huge burrito  and tasty too."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place throws a little \"curve\" for me. Nice variation of flavorful Mexican, I mean New Mexican! Their salsa will satisfy your taste butt and will definitely challenge you too...be ready to sweat! Ingredients are fresh and the portion is pretty good~! Def a local gem!!!"}
{"text":"The service was good. There was a short wait, but that was expected. The servers were professional, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I had a house margarita. There was nothing special about it, but it was a good generic drink. I had the carne adovada platter. It was a little on the spicy side, but quite tasty. My husband had a burrito which was nothing special, but good. The style of Mexican food here is New Mexican cuisine. It isn't my absolute favorite, but I like it. Overall, the experience was good and I'll return. This wasn't my first time there."}
{"text":"This is gr8 place to go for breakfast burritos! They are huge and on the weekends they are bogo! Good food and good service for counter orders."}
{"text":"The staff you currently have on Tuesday nights is lackluster at best.   I kept waiting to say something hoping it was just a fluke but unfortunately that is not the case. It just keeps repeating itself.  Example: The gal working at the register at 400PM yesterday acted as though customers were interrupting her.  She stood at the bar (customer side) talking to one of her departing co-workers (seated at bar) for several minutes.  This left an older woman standing at the counter with no one even acknowledging her.  A big order needed to be packed up and she just stood staring into outer space while the other gal pack up all the food.  It appears she couldn't even help put 1 lid on a bowl.   No teamwork in a place this small is apparent to all of the customers.  We ordered items that were forgotten and then given the \"evil eye\" when we stated we were  missing the item.  After waiting several more minutes I walked up to the counter and was asked \"have you already placed an order\" in a rude tone. Customer orders all come out at the same time regardless of when tplaced.  Example I got my order at the same time as a customer ordering 10 minutes later.  We have been loyal customers for quite sometime and sing your praises to all we can but don't know if I can continue to do that. This never happened when Eileen was there on Tuesday nights.  Perhaps you need to have a strong team leader on duty for Tuesday nights when I know it gets hectic.  As a member of the staff there please don't treat customers as though they are a nuisance and that you shouldn't have to be bothered.  
Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have found some of the best food at hole in the wall restaurants!  Wonderful food and great margaritas at great prices!  LOVE the green chili!"}
{"text":"Starvin' like Marvin, we arrived for dinner on Thursday night around 7:30pm.  I'd heard how good this place was that served cuisine of New Mexico.  What does that mean?  Something to do with hatch chiles.  All I know is that it was some good eating.  I was so ready to eat that I have no pictures of the food.
I had two chicken enchiladas, a red chile pork tamale, and a side of black beans; the beans were not necessary after all that food--I had two bites.  Boyfriend had a stuffed steak sopapilla, a tamale, and a side of rice.  Not much talking, lots of scarfing.  Everything was so delicious, fresh, and cheap for what we ordered.  This is one of those places that has so many good things on the menu that it's hard to decide, so take a gander before you go.  I want to return to try some other items, like the Navajo Taco and the dessert sopapilla, and next time I'll remember to save room."}
{"text":"Dont get in the way of a HUNGRY MAN ready to order. I have never been disappointed. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Chicken and beef enchiladas and steak burrito were just average.  The spice really overwhelms any other flavors and the meats were low quality."}
{"text":"Where oh where did my review go? I had a review written, maybe it was just in my head, and now it is lost. 

It was a Sunday morning, cloudy skies, windy and rather dreary. We were unsure where to go, surprise, surprise! Driving down Pecos, discussing options, I asked the wife if she was feeling adventurous, to which she said yes. 

A quick right turn lead us straight to Carlito's Burrito's. We were not quite sure what to expect as we walked up to the burrito place next to a bakery and tattoo shop. Upon opening the door, we were greeted by delicious aromas and a full establishment, with patron's aluminum food container tray items generously filled with oversized, drenched burritos.

Shuffling between the chairs and soda fountain, we made our way to the counter to order, leaning back to stair at the big screen tv menus mounted near the ceiling, our meal choices formed within our minds quite quickly.

A soft spoken, but courteous and polite gentleman took our order, answered our questions and efficiently handed our drink cups to us. Shuffling back toward the soda fountain, we filled our cups with carbonated, sugary drinks and sat down at a freshly vacated table. 

They were so busy, the staff could not get to an empty table to wipe it down before it was re-occupied. Heck, the vacating customers couldn't all be out of their seats before the next patrons were sitting down! 

While having a brief discussion about the artwork on the walls and how busy the restaurant was, the soft spoken man brought out our meals with an inquiry as to anything else we needed, or he could do for us. With tongues eager to taste the delicious smelling food before us, they spoke of their own volition and assured him we were ready to eat.

I had chicken enchiladas in red sauce with rice, she had a bowl containing the innards of a dissected burrito.

The red sauce has some bite to it, but not too much to obliterate the flavor and essence of the chiles that lived up to their purpose of being a part of a great sauce. The chicken bits were succulent and tender, not a hint of overcooked dryness was detected.

I am guessing her food was equally as delicious, as we finished our meals in near silence, aside from comments about how good the food was, and asking why we waited so long to eat there.

This was our first, but definitely not our last visit. I am anxious to get a chance to try some of their happy hour specials, and sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, Great service. 

I had the Saturday night special: red chile ribs with green chile mashed potatoes and chopped veggies called calabacitas.

Just spicy enough.  And they have Jamaica drink at the soda bar!!"}
{"text":"If you're from NM there is noooo better place I get your green chile fix! Whether it's your daily craving or your Sunday routine it's always consistent and brings a sense of being at home (NM) yearly roasting of chile keeps you set at home for the year too....our \"Tia\" always takes care of us as we do her!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good price but a slow on getting the orders out. Two times in a row we waited over 15 minutes for a burito. The Wife says best breakfast burito in town. Keep up the good food Carlito's!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place received so many positive reviews. I am originally from New Mexico, and was so excited to find this place while traveling thru Vegas. 
To begin with, the place is filthy. Grime cakes almost every surface. The food is perhaps the worst approximation of New Mexican cuisine I have ever encountered. I ordered a chicken burrito, smothered with red and green chile, and was sad to find that the tortillas are not hand made. Also, the chicken inside was dry and rubbery. Any NM restaurant worth it's salt would have slow cooked the meat in red or green chile sauce until it was tender and juicy. The chile sauce was ok, but it was reduced to nothing but a dry crust on top of the dry tortilla. 
My daughter's cheese enchilada was much better, but was swimming in a soup-like sauce. 
I do have to say that the sopapillas were excellent, however. Very authentic and delicious. That is why I gave 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Um hello breakfast burrito central! This is our go to breakfast burittos place on Sundays! You ask why do we go on Sundays well because they have buy one get one breakfast burritos! Hello! Our all time favorite breakfast burrito is the chorizo burrito with refried beans and extra cheese with green sauce on the side (it's super spicy). We get both of those for $9! Unheard of and so worth it! We absolutely love our Sunday tradition! If you haven't had a burrito you must stop and get one!"}
{"text":"Wow - the worst service and breakfast burrito I've ever had! The breakfast burrito is half the size of their other burritos (at least mine was) and it took 45 minutes to make. Also found a unidentified 1.5 inch object that was hard as a rock in the burrito."}
{"text":"Place just keeps getting better.  Breakfast burrito smothered in Green is as good as it gets for breakfast burritos.  Go with the chicken stuffed sopapilla \"Christmas\" for amazing flavors."}
{"text":"The meat was bland, the beans obviously canned.  Prices out of line. Was not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning around 10 and boy was it packed already. Lol it was bustling with customers and it was a 15 minute wait altogether if you ordered ahead of time by phone. The lady who took the ordered by phone was awesome and made some suggestions for first timers. I ordered the popular Smothered Fries with green chili sauce. It was yummy and fulfilling for a small size. I can only imagine the large size is enough for two or three people. The fries were baked judging from the texture since it was not crispy and that made the toppings blend well with each bite of it. Great place if you're craving for some Mexican food on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but not amazing enough to charge over 34.00 for 2 burritos, I guess they are charging us customers for your moving expenses to new location, I didn't ask u too move....new prices way over priced.... Just lost a weekly customer...."}
{"text":"Carlito's serves authentic New Mexican food.  The green chile pork ANYTHING is delicious.  Personal favorites include the Navajos tacos (tacos on fry dough), pork pozole (different than Mexican pozole),  and the green chile stew.  Dollar beer and $3 margaritas make it nice to eat in and relax for awhile."}
{"text":"Moving to Las Vegas from New Mexico I thought I would never again eat tasty NM food and chile....UNTIL, I found out about Carlito's Burritos.  I was referred here, otherwise I would have missed it, which is the only down side to this fantastic joint-it is too small.  The food is amazing, the staff is great and overall I am thrilled to have true New Mexican cooking here in the LV valley.  This has become one of my family's regular dining locations."}
{"text":"I was told I just had to try this place. So already I was thinking it was gonna be real good. I was just ok. I cant think of anything that stood out."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I like the new location too. The grilled veggies are amazing as everything here is!!!!! So happy that we discovered this gem!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the new location yet, so I thought I might take the family to what we remember as excellent true New Mexican food. To our surprise, the food was SO much better when they were in the smaller location. Apparently the carne adovada is no longer cooked in the red chile and more to being mass cooked plain and then having your red or green chile sauce poured over it. Both the red and the green chile sauce were so watered down that anyone in or from New Mexico would be ashamed. (I am and was) My wife's burrito bowl was more like a soup, my stuffed sopapilla turned into a doughy mess, and the carne adovada was so fatty that I just couldn't eat it. We also couldn't understand why no one before us had mentioned to the staff that the soda machine was out of carbonation. I heard rumors some time ago that they were giving BBQ a try, but the only remnants of any BBQ was a old beat up charcoal grill in the middle of the dining area. For the size of the new restaurant, one would think that servers could wait on you, but people are still shoved into a cattle line that blocks anyone from easily making it to the dining area to get a seat. It is a very confusing layout. To bad that the growth in size and failed attempt in BBQ resulted in the downward spiral of the food quality. In our experience, the next thing to cut off for savings is the real honey."}
{"text":"We did the beer pairing dinner series.  Too little food, served too slow with too many people stuffed in like sardines.  Wouldn't recommend it. I am glad they have so many people people willing to attend. It just won't be us again."}
{"text":"The family on my Mom's side are all from New Mexico, so I have eaten a chili or two in my day.  This place knocks it out of the park.  

If you want a medium kick, go with red chili.  Turn it up a notch with green chili.  If you are a total wuss bag, don't get the chili, and go back to New York City.  

My personal favorites here are the breakfast burritos (served all day!!!).  The hash-browns within are always crispy, a feat I will never understand.  Add some carne adovada (pork marinated in red chili) with eggs and cheddar, and your taste buds will salsa dance the rest of the day (or into the night).  For spicier flair, try a pork verde (green chili marinated pork) with extra green chilis.  

I do not suggest getting it \"smothered\", which is adding even more chilis to the outside, and cheddar.  It is just too much.  Keep the chilis in the burrito, and everything will be just fine."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! Always good food! Usually frequent this place with co-workers at lunch time.  A pretty happening place, so obviously a lot of people love Carlito's Burritos. The staff is very friendly! I LOVE the tacos and sopapillas!"}
{"text":"A meal that I actually finished... get outta here!!!

This place is worthy of the 5 star title. The food is sooooo good it'll have you signing up for their rewards program and coming back. We were looking for a place where we both have never been and he remembered his friend had recommended this place. Well thank you, friend! I really enjoyed the people and the food.

I asked the lady who took our order what the most popular thing was. She suggested the sopapilla but I was almost tempted to get a burrito. My friend got a burrito so I figured I would get the sopapilla and we could share! What's a sopapilla? It's like stuffed fried or toasted bread. I was shocked at just how yummy it was. We also got chicken smothered fries to share, so delicious. His burrito was super good too, with the green sauce (which apparently is spicier than the red sauce).

Overall, the service was great and the food was even better. I want some more right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"If there was a tinder for food then Carlitos would be one of the places I would swipe right for. The bio would read something like this: big, giant portions. Green chile sauce all over everything. Burritos so big, you'll need two hands. What connoisseur of Mexican food would not be intrigued? I would message them with something to the effect of, Hi I'm a big fan of sopapillas, but I have a hard time finding them in Las Vegas, I especially love good service and margaritas. They would then respond: yes, we have sopapillas. You can get them with chicken or carne and red or green chile. And if you don't know there are also dessert sopapillas which are quite delicious. If none of the above entices you, then you can always stick to the basics: tacos and beer. There's domestic and imported cervezas. And on the taco front, there's a previously unheard of Navajo taco. 
If you swipe right on this place, and decide that the aforementioned food sounds delicious then the cashier will pronounce you as a union and you can shortly expect a happy food baby in the immediate future"}
{"text":"A taste of New Mexico in Las Vegas.

My husband and I saw the good yelp reviews so we dragged our four kids out to Carlito's Burritos.  It is not far from the LV strip.  If you like spicy food this is the place. There are also items for those  in your party that do not like spice.  My non spice eater enjoyed the cheese quesadilla.

It is a small casual restaurant located in a strip mall.  You order the food then it is brought to your table.  Everything is served in aluminum containers that look like deep dish plates.  Depending on where you sit it can be a little cramped.  The menu was a little confusing at first, but if you hang in there you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend anything with the green sauce, it was amazing, fresh and zesty.   

We ordered the chips and salsa, the chips arrived warm and covered in an amazing chili powder that had great flavor,not to spicy.  They brought out a green and a red salsa with the chips.  Everyone loved the green tomatillo salsa, the red not so much.  I ordered the stuffed fry bread with chicken and smothered in green sauce.  It was very good, although I was expecting the fry bread to actually be crispy, it was more like an enchilada with all the sauce.  Still very good, the chicken was moist and delicious.  My husband had ordered the pork tamale, he ended up liking my item better.  My two son's ordered the cheese enchilada with red sauce.  I really enjoyed eating off their plate, the red sauce was perfect. 

Wish they would have had kid sized items.  My daughter (age 7) wanted a bean burrito; plain beans and tortilla.  I ended up paying $5 for a huge burrito that she only ate 1/4.

We ended our meal with everyone getting a sopapilla.  We love this New Mexico dessert and have eaten it at a lot of restaurants over the years.  This is definitely one the best versions we have eaten.  It is a little more doughy than some, but it is not greasy at all.  It is light and fluffy and melts in your mouth.  Smothered in honey, we were all in heaven.  They are large so you could share, but we didn't.

If you are in Las Vegas and want to avoid the craziness of the strip and just want some good food, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, friendly atmosphere.
Highly recommended. First time trying it and absolutely love it should make a new location in the southwest region of Vegas though."}
{"text":"Carlito's has great New Mexican style food. The green chile prom smothered fries are my favorite thing here. The carne adovada burrito is super yummy! Get it smothered, so GOOD! The sopapillas are a yummy dessert option. I prefer the vibe around lunchtime; it's a more casual feeling. Dinner is more like a restaurant, which is fine, but I like the more chill vibe. I believe you can order roasted New Mexico green chilies when they're in season (summer time-ish)."}
{"text":"So, after a few more visits I have to say I really love this place. Prices are so reasonable, it's ridiculous. The portions are huge, I almost always have to share to get through a whole order.

After seeing their post for Super Bowl bbq and catering, we couldn't resist ordering the nacho bar. We picked the fixings up the morning of the game and there was so much food for the very small price tag we had to pay. The ingredients were fresh and we were thrilled with everything. The game was a bore but luckily our nacho bar and good company made the party a complete success."}
{"text":"First time to eat here and it was great! Nice place with paintings to admire while waiting (these are for sale you can check them out). Staff were really nice and served the food fast. Though I only ordered Sopapilla, I'd say, I will be back to try other food on the menu! Spicy food people should really come here. Plus, I love that they have Coca Cola!!"}
{"text":"They moved from their original location but their food is still just as delicious. They have a much larger seating area so that's a plus. Thursday's they have a 1/4 lb by burger special with green hatch that my husband always gets along with Christmas fries. I stick to stuffed sopapillas ! This place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food a true south of the border place. Went in for lunch and a late breakfast today. I had the Carlitos Burrito (steak) with red sauce. Really really good. My wife had the Huevos Rancheros for another great meal. These were both what I expect to get in the smaller restaurants along the Baja while off road racing and visiting places. Best Mexican food in Vegas. Place is small and always crowded but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful if you love New Mexican food very friendly and only at the $ level which is sweet

Great place for New Mexican chili"}
{"text":"Been a regular for some time but just realized I've never actually given a review.  Carlito's is a local favorite of mine and for whatever reason, my co-workers disagree.  I personally think anybody who doesn't appreciate this place is just so confused by commercialized \"Mexican food\" that they lack an ability to appreciate something new and moreover, authentic.  I've spent a lot of time in New Mexico and have never been able to find an establishment outside of the Land of Enchantment offering fare equally fresh & unique.  Low & behold, Carlito's is here to save the day!  I no longer have to drive 8 hours to find a place that knows what \"Christmas tree\" really means.  I no longer have to get on a plane to find an Indian Taco or Tortilla Burger.  I can get my fix on Route 66 right here in Vegas!  If you're expecting Taco Bell \"Mexican food\" go home.   But if you want something fresh and high quality, give Carlito's a try.  Best \"NEW Mexican Food\" outside of New Mexico!"}
