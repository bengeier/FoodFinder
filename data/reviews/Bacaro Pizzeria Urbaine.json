{"text":"Ordered a pizza with a plate of arancini. An adequate meal for two people who weren't too too hungry.  The prosciutto was too salty, and the rest of the pizza was a bit lacking in flavor. We did appreciate that it was non-greasy though.  Arancini came with a tomato sauce and was good. Its warmth and soft risotto paired well with the pizza.  Beware of getting charged for water. We got charged $6 per bottle."}
{"text":"Yummmy.  Spent the day on Mont Royal.  The Fitbit had us at 17314 and i was thirsty dreaming of a cold beer.  Bumped into this place and figured the beer was cold and ready.  We came in and we're immediately greeted by a smiling bar tender.  She convinced us to eat pizza and tho i came for only a beer we ordered a meatball ricotta pizza.  Wow, yummy thin crust that every bite made me smile.  And the beer...oh the homemade is quite good.  So come and eat the pizza.  PS: spicy homemade sauce is a winner.  Bought a bottle to bring back to USA"}
{"text":"we got there a 9 pm on a Saturday night  we got a good sitting spot on the terrace we ordered 2 Cesar salads (2 stars) the romaine was kind of not too fresh a lot of rusty spots but I liked the sliced radish but only if they are sliced just before serving , too much dressing for my taste and will definitely change the pizza crust croutons  for maybe a toasted and diced focaccia or just kind of homemade croutons , the pizza was good but a little too thin to my taste I would give a 4 . The water came not cold and  not even served with ice cubes this is a basic in service . The waitress did not suggest any desert at the end I guess she had not enough experience or maybe too tired from a long shift. The restaurant is beautiful i like very much the style  4 stars Prices where ok this place have a good potential"}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly service, good but far from great or unique pizzas; much needed sort of place in the area; BUT the noise level is beyond ridiculous. Was there for lunch at 1 pm mid-week, and sat at the bar with a friend. We were the only one's at the bar, and could barely hear ourselves speak. Anywhere else was much worse"}
{"text":"I've never had a pizza that tasted this disgusting, horrible service too  and charge extra for any little thing and don't do half / half pizzas"}
{"text":"I went for a work lunch with three coworkers and we all ordered pizza. I ordered the speck and mushroom and thought it was fantastic, and we finished with the Nutella pizza for dessert. I would recommend this place for lunch or casual dinner, only one negative comment is that it gets noisy with the sound bouncing off the floor and walls since there's no carpet and no sound insulation on the walls."}
{"text":"Une des meilleures pizzeria de Montréal. Après avoir découvert cette adresse j'y suis allé au moins 4 fois. Les pizza me rappellent vraiment celle du pays."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision as we were referred by a friend who lives in the area. Service was friendly and pizzas were great, wood burning oven, thin crust.   A few of us had pasta as well and enjoyed quite a bit as well. They even had a giant Nutella container that they brought down for us so my daughter and her friends could take a picture, very accommodating staff.  Enjoyed the experience and would come back for sure."}
{"text":"chewy mozzarella cheese, bland dough, grocery store grade tomato sauce and actual chili oil is nowhere to be found in that restaurant. To add insult to injury, they gave me a cup of cheap olive oil with a few chili flakes in it instead of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Everything is just okay. For a $14 salad, there's really just grass in it. The pizza was fine, but it kind of felt like foodcourt pizza. The service is not the best. The waitress only refilled our water at the very end (glasses were small ones too). The price is a bit expensive considering we can get much better food in this area at this price level."}
{"text":"We stopped by by accident as we were heading somewhere else. Service was impeccable and super friendly (even arriving at a non-child friendly place with two children ) our pizza and salad and soup (for the little one) were absolutely delicious, and the Nutella fritters were perfect as Nutella and deep fried whatever :)"}
{"text":"Bravo!  We need this type of trendy restaurant in the area. Service is good. The decor is ok, the noise level is LOUD.  No nibbles or appetizers to order....hmmm  The oven baked pizza was pretty good. Burned at the edges, but I know some like it that way.  The salad was mediocre and swimming in oil. Make sure you tell them to relax.  Coke is reasonable but they give you a thimble-full at a time.  Probably will go back."}
{"text":"Le secret le mieux gardé à Montréal. Excellentes pizzas qui rappellent l'Italie. Excellent service. Un must"}
{"text":"Worth the price, delicious food, better in groups.  Special price of 27$ per person for groups of 8 or more, which is a bargain for ALL the food they serve (2 kinds of salads, as much as you need, 4 kinds of pizza, once again as much as you need).  The salads were fine, we had ceasar and another that was spinach (I think) with parmesan and citrus. Sour but very nice, didn't compare with the pizzas that are DELICIOUS.  Thin crusted, lots of veggies (or meat, if that's what you chose), they brought me right back to Italy - which I visited recently.  The Nutella fritters at the end was a nice touch, also absolutely delicious.  As for the service, the manager(?) was a charm, and waitresses were always available and diligent in their service.  So, if you want to eat pizza, you should check this place out.  If, however, you think it's an outrage every restaurant that has some italian food does NOT have pasta and DEMAND they accomodate to your every need (never mind they have a menu you can check beforehand), and are insulted by the fact that some pictures don't perfectly represent the food, then maybe it's best you stay at home.   For us mere mortals, this place checks out."}
{"text":"A new and trendy pizzeria located in mid Westmount. Came on a Friday night and the place was semi busy, the crowd was a mix of couples, friends, and families.  The menu consisted of single portion sized pizzas, a few pasta dishes, and a salad section.  The pizzas were good and the ambience was nice, but the restaurant was a bit hit and miss.  First off we tried a couple of single sized pizzas that were tasty but also a bit expensive at $18 - $22 each. Toppings were not so generous either.   The salads were very disappointing. The Italian salad was literally a plate of plain salad greens with a tiny bit of dressing. We saw salads at other tables and it was similar, plain lettuce and dressing. Considering all of the pizzas we saw were topped with salad greens it's probably not necessary to order a salad.  Secondly my bloody ceasar was terrible. It was a small glass of clamato with trace amounts of vodka and a single tiny olive. Which, at $10 each was incredible plain.  Our meal ended up being ~$80 for 1 drink, 1salad, and 2 single pizzas which may not be worth it for some."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 2 star because although the staff is inexperienced , they a sweet and try hard . Maybe having a manager present would help a lot!  I give the ridiculous stupid customer policies of management a zero!!! 1. They do not allow tea to be served because they only want to sell expresso . The belief is tea does not go with pizza and Italian food . So.... They won't allow it as a beverage of choice . 2. My daughter brought her baby into this kid family friendly sister restaurant in westmount . She asked management where she could change her diaper ? They told her they don't allow diaper changes in the restaurant anywhere !!!! What world do these people live in ? How do they think up these stupid management choices  for their paying customers?! It most certainly isn't a real one with real people .  Advice to owners : Think about people's lives and customer preferences not your desirable fantasy conceptual lifestyle choices !!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! We were large group of 40 people. The menu was pre fix. From Aranchini to pizzas to Nutella fritters, everything was amazingly presented and tasted heaven. Recommended definitely !"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times with family and also gotten take away a few times.  The pizza is decent, and there is a good selection, but we found menu items to be slightly overpriced.  Salads were a disappointment.  Service was usually good although a few times we had a bit of a wait for our food.  There's not a lot of pizza options in the neighbourhood, so this is not a bad choice if you're in the area, but not a place to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I went more than three time at Westmount's Bacaro. I always loved that place. We are celebrating my sister's 13th bday and we decided to go to Bacaro at the old Faubourg. It's a beautiful and big restaurant. Amazing lighting; nice rustic decor, comfortable seats... The hostess and our waitress (Francesca) were very friendly, helpful and very nice.  We ordered fried calamari, two types of pizzas (1. tomato, basil, ricotta cheese 2. Prosciutto, tomato, mozzarella and arugula). For desert; we took their famous donuts with Nutella. Every single item were really delicious.   The ambiance was lovely.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"New Italian restaurant on Monkland?   We're in.  The place is gorgeous, service is really wonderful.....but the place is so overcrowded.  The lineup to get in was outside the door.    So, we got pizza to take out.  We chose the ZAZA pizza - 18.00 (crumbled sausages, mozzarella, red peppers, basil). The pizzas are all thin crust and very small - 12\".  The sausage was great, the red pepper was bottled, not fresh.    Crust was kind of wet and sloppy, but the taste was ok.    Not great, just ok.  We also ordered the arancini - 8.00 (5) breaded tomato and cheese risotto croquettes  My man (who is old school Italian) asked if it was going to be as good as his mother's arancini.    The server said it was better and we'd be back the next day for it.    We won't be going back for the arancini but it was ok.     We'll stick to his mom's dish  :-)  If you are lucky enough to get a seat there, you'll like sitting in a VERY trendy pizza place but the food doesn't taste like Nonna's.   It fits in with the Monkland crowd well though."}
{"text":"Went there recently there with friends for dinner on a saturday night, We each chose our own pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was friendly and prices are right. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice theme did not outweigh the negatives. The restaurant is very small and the tables are crammed too close together. We asked the host for a different table to start because he tried to stick us in a crowded spot, when there were available tables that weren't all crammed together. We ordered a sangria and a beer. They have \"wine on tap\" which is just glorified boxed wine. The sangria was made from it and wasn't impressive. The beer was flat, and I asked for another option. The server politely replaced my beer but we noticed the bar staff remarking with disagreement - not very subtly given how small space of a space it is. We had the lasagna and cappriciosa pizza. The lasagna was bland and the sauce tasted like it was from a can, summing it up as something that we could probably make at home. The pizza had a good crust, but lacked that punchy Italian flavour that a new restaurant needs to contend in a trendy market."}
{"text":"This is located at the old Faubourg and opened recently. I was craving for Pizza and this was the place I chose. I ordered the Diavola pizza which is mozzarella and spicy salami. Oh my it is delicious! I'm not a huge fan for gourmet pizza but this was not to thin or thick and importantly it wasn't wet. They serve a pepper relish and a spicy oil at each table. I had enough room for my cappuccino and desert which was a cheesecake with black cherries toppings. It was light and a perfect way to end the evening! Service was great and a recommended place to try. Good for family outing!."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, but there are many better tastier places around town. The decor is not very exciting and the prices are high for what you get.  It's a shame because this area doesn't have lots of great food nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and dinner - I've even tried it for takeout. The service is good but the crowd is so lively that you can barely hear yourself talk. The food is delicious, with my favourites being: the margarita pizza, the kale salad with extra goat's cheese and the Nutella fritters. Even their iced coffees are yummy. Disappointments: they don't make any substitutions and their bellini cockatil is tiny."}
{"text":"Been waiting for it's opening for a long while. We were 6, 4 out of 6 ordered pizza, they were good overall. One of us ordered Manicotti, and asked for parmesean cheese, we were told that there was an extra charge. My question to all is: 'who serves pasta and charge extra to have parmesan cheese on top??'"}
{"text":"Wow was the service here absolutely horrible! We were seated quickly because it was not too crowded. Then we waited over 20 minutes until the waitress even came over to our table. The pizza was average , but the drinks were horrible (and also took 20 minutes for the waitress to get) and the pizza came out before we ever got any drinks. Proceeded to ask for a glass of water three times and left without a sip of water with my pizza. Much better places in the area don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Just opened a couple of months ago I was walking beside home and found it. I decided to have my lunch there. They offer a special lunch menu. I tried their chicken Parmesan served with pasta. It was excellent. Service also was so professional. I was swamped at work and had to do a lot on my computer they offered me their wifi and the plug to help me. I sat in front of the window where there is plenty of sun. It is a bright place and the food and service are very good."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, and the service wasn't so great. They charge for Parmesan and the bartender claims that its fair because she believes they're not an Italian restaurant but they just so happen to be a pizzeria that serves Italian inspired dishes. What a joke!"}
{"text":"SUCH a DISAPOINTMENT.  I wanted SO badly to love this place  as a local and pizza lover!!!!! This is my 2nd time eating here.   We went in yesterday with our 3 year old- sat down and asked for pasta w/ butter and or parmesean cheese.  The answer was NO. ZERO kid friendly options in Westmount which has a lot of families makes no sense.  How can you not have pasta w/ simple parm cheese or butter? Thats nuts. Moving past that- we ordered the same soup as our first visit and salads. Taste just OK.  Service: As we finish the salads, a server comes over and askes \"Would you now like some dessert or coffee\"? She obviously had no idea those are not main courses and no idea what we had ordered.   I had ordered (just like our 1st visit) my pizza well done crispy. This didnt happen (same issue on our first visit) - The pizza came out soggy.  I literally took it to the oven myself where they fixed the problem.   Taste: Again, just \"Eh\".  How can oven pizza not be amazing (none the less a margarita simple one) ? Such a shame.  ON THE TABLE displayed was  a picture of Nutella and Strawberries.  My 3 yr old said she would like that- i kindly asked for what was in the picture and the reply was that they do not sell strawberries and Nutella. OK so why picture it?   Check comes: Total 2 salads, 2 soups, 1 pizza (single sized), 1 Soda. Total $75. Overpriced.   Side note- when you do get your act together- offer local delivery within a few blocks to get more business."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant is okay, perfect for lunch, but don't fear to dish out some money for pizza.  Food : the pizzas were actually very good. Originally seasoned and nicely flavoured (and I'm a girl who loves her pizza!). I asked the waitress for the most popular dessert and she suggested the Nutella doughnut holes. They were good, but tasted exactly like you'd expect them to taste.  Service : although the wait staff is very friendly, the service is quite long, considering the menu options. Don't be too much of in a hurry.  Decor : simple but nice. the TVs are a little distracting considering the place isn't that big. The bathrooms are VERY small - I know this doesn't affect the restaurants quality, but it was worth the mention."}
{"text":"Went here for our department's Christmas celebration. Originally it was supposed to be held at the location in Westmount but it was changed last minute to the new location outside the Faubourg which was probably a lot better since this restaurant recently opened so was not crowded and it was a shorter walk from a metro than the location at Westmount.  I found service to be okay but a bit chaotic as my order was mixed up by different people bringing different items (ex: asking for something from one server and then someone else putting it on the table; sometimes at the wrong spot; this happened for one of my beers as well as my dessert)  This place has a lot of different types of pizzas and pastas but I opted for their Italian Poutine to give it a try. I also had a 20oz Stella Artois. The Italian Poutine wasn't what I preferred. It has a meat ball on it (which I found interesting) but I wasn't impressed by the sauce nor how they made the fries. I can't really say much about the beer since I'm not a heavy beer drinker but I asked for another Stella Artois after I finished my first. When most people finished their meals, the server gave us the dessert menu. Most people didn't order dessert but I decided to get the cheesecake Amarena. It was very good. A few minutes after the server gave me my dessert, since some people from our party were starting to leave (but the people in my area were still around), she asked if I minded paying now. I mentioned that I didn't have any issues with it and she handed me my bill, I noticed that I wasn't charged for the cheesecake and being the honest person I am, asked about it and she mentioned that they put it on someone else's bill by mistake (he hadn't paid yet and this was one of the items which was brought to the wrong spot after I ordered it). For some reason I was the only person asked to pay in my section of the table who hadn't indicated that he was leaving. I probably wouldn't have had anything else (like a coffee) after the dessert so it wasn't a big deal. She then left and brought me my new bill. Not including tip, my bill came to $35.64. I used my credit card so the place accepts credit cards (not sure about debit cards since no one sitting next to me in our party paid or asked about using a debit card)  Servers were friendly and polite. Since this place recently opened (maybe less than 2 weeks ago from what I understand), the place was not what I considered to be crowded on the night that we went (Friday night). Our party was ~25 people (which were divided into 2 rows at the back of the restaurant) and there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant.  I give this place 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars. I would not have any issues coming back for a group/team event but it wouldn't be my first choice. I would probably have one of their pizzas the next time I show up since this is what most people ordered and I wasn't overly impressed by their Italian poutine."}
{"text":"Endroit sympa pour dîner entre amis/collègue. Le service est plutôt sympa mais un peu cher je trouve. C'est peut être le quartier que veut ça aussi. Les pizzas sont bonnes, cuites au feu de bois, avec pâte fine sans gluten, et de taille assez importante qu'on a eu du mal à finir. J'ai trouvé les bières vraiment cher pour le coup, entre 8 et 7,5 $ le verre de 25 CL (-2$ en happy hour)."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the selection of pizzas on the menu do not have much variation from each other. If you want to build your own pizza it is very costly so you are stuck with their mediocre options or building a pizza for 3-5$ extra each topping you choose. I ordered a vegetarian pizza and under my pizza, stuck on my plate, was a piece of ham. When I told the waiter, he asked me what I wanted him to do about it. Overall was not impressed with the service or selection, the food is okay, the ingredients are fresh, the menu is very simple, the crust is very limp. I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a weekday and waited way too long for just a cheese pizza that cost me $14. 35 minutes to be precise. That doesn't leave me enough time to enjoy my pizza or my lunch hour. Don't go chasing waterfalls, just stick to the Pizza huts and Domino's your used to."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new spot on an early Thursday night to avoid any line ups. We were well greeted and were seated in a nice spot to accommodate our two kids. Overall staff is extremely friendly & attentive! We ordered an Arancini starter and three different types of pizza. Firstly, I should mention that my husband is 100% italian and we are lucky enough to enjoy Nonna's Arancini on special occasions. Sadly, this was not as good. The risotto was overcooked. However the outside breading was tasty and perfectly done. I was just missing the delicacy of the saffron  and cube of mozzarella in the middle.  For the pizzas, we did their traditional margarita, Fungi (mushroom) special and a simple cheese & pepperoni. The tastiest by far was the margarita one. The others were just too bland and lacked the punch of fresh favor italian cooking is known for.  I think this place has lots of potential but with so many pizza spots around, they will need to step it up a bit to impress this italian family!"}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and friendly and the place overall had a really good vibe! The food was good for the price, but the pasta was better than the pizza. I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"Such an unexpected treat as we walked by and saw a beautiful restaurant with a lovely terrace. We were greeted by Lily,the owner, who was so friendly and personable. She found us the perfect table and made some fabulous recommendations. Amelia was a great and attentive server. We enjoyed all our food, especially the gnocchi. Angelis, Lily's husband came over to talk and we felt like we were at home while talking with him and Lily. As we are from Washington, DC we enjoyed talking about hockey and football... although we are not Steelers fans, we enjoyed the conversation and making new friends while enjoying a lovely meal!"}
{"text":"really enjoyed the pizza, very fresh and tasty ingredients. The decor was warm and inviting and server was friendly and checked on us frequently.All in all great experience and would recommend this place to others !"}
{"text":"Great pizza to order and lasagna was delicious too. Friendly staff made it a good time for me."}
{"text":"We have been spoiled in Montreal recently with all the great pizzerias that have opened up. The flip side of having such great pizza readily available is that pizzerias must work that much harder to keep our interests. Average pizza just won't cut it anymore. Last week, I found myself in Westmount at Bacaro Urban Pizzeria - for the record, we need to kill the adding of \"Urban\" to things that don't need it but I digress - ready to enjoy a pizza and see how they stacked up to my favorites.  It was dead on the weeknight we were there - only one other table was occupied - so the ambience was non-existant. The room is nice though - very clean and modern with touches of a more classic Italian pizzeria. I liked the use of old Italian sports newspaper as wallpaper and the painted murals of some of their suppliers. There is also a bar at the entrance with a entire shelf of large Nutella jars - once I saw their dessert list, I understood why!  We kept it short and sweet on this evening so I got to try a couple of pizzas. My selection was the Polpetta - meatballs, ricotta and basil. The pizza had a good size - very filling for one person. The amount of toppings was plentiful although I would have loved more basil personally. I loved the combination of the meatballs with the creamy ricotta. My issue was with the crust however. While the picture does show a nice char on the top, the underside was too soft - there was no crunch and the pizza could not be lifting at all without it collapsing on itself. The pizza was very flavourful but with a thin crust pizza, you need a solid crust and that was lacking.  It was a similar story with my girlfriend's pizza, the Quasi Norma - eggplants, zucchinis, red peppers and ricotta. Tons of fresh veggies, the right amount of cheese and sauce but the underside was just too limp and soft.  We did have time for dessert though - especially when we saw how much Nutella was involved. We decided to share the Nutella cream cake - sliced panettone layered with nutella cream served with nutella sauce. If you love Nutella then this is your cake. Good lord was this rich and decadent. I expected the panettone to be harder in texture but frankly it was better this way. A great way to cap off the evening.  Bacaro had high standards to meet for me and didn't quite get there. The flavours were there all around and the service was nice and friendly but if the crust is lacking, then the pizza just can't hold up for me. If the crunch appears, we have a winner but until then, Bacaro can't quite reach my upper echelon of pizzerias.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally a great pizza west of Decarie. The wood burning pie is excellent with wonderful toppings. Good service and a little noisy but truly worth it!"}
{"text":"came here with a friend! environment is very nice and clean, as it is brand new! our waitress was very kind and personable and fun! i got the margherita pizza and it was okay, but was expecting a little more neapolitan style touch in the crust and sauce and prefer buffalo cheese. it still hit the spot and i enjoyed the nutella donuts too! i live really close so will probably come back again for late night pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Ma première fois au Restaurant Bacaro   Accueil charmant à la porte en rentrant et la personne qui fait l'accueil nous apporte à notre table et après notre serveuse vient nous voir si on veux avoir quelque chose à boire   J'ai vérifié le menu de A à Z pour voir qu'est qui a comme entrées pâtes pizza ect y'a des bon choix ses Dur de décidé quoi prendre   J'ai fini part prendre la pizza au olives noir et anchois à 16$ très bonne la pâte et mince et croustillante beaucoup d'anchois quelque olives mozzarella sauce tomate portion de 4 pointes ou si vous la coupe 8 petite pointes j'ai pris à boire un coke à 3$   Le service numéro un  L'attente pour ma pizza environ 15 minutes raisonnable  Prix bon"}
