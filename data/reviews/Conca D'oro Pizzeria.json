{"text":"Really, really good pizza with top notch ingredients and quality that you can taste. The old man making the pizza speaks broken English which is always a good start in my book! Staff is always polite, and the inside is squeaky clean with a small sit down area for eating in."}
{"text":"A local cash-only pizza parlor.
These guys pay attention to the details.
Delicious, chewy hand-tossed crust, fresh tomato sauce and generous topping portions.
Take-out or sit-in, it's all good..."}
{"text":"I have been going here since in the early 1990s (high school) and every time it's great.   It is only cash but that is ok because they have a real pizza oven not a conveyor belt.   A good family run business.  There prices are higher than the chain pizza stores but you do get a good pie.

Btw the best pizza in the area!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Good dough and toppings but floppy after delivery. Overpriced, $35 for a 16\" pizza and six whole wings. Now why two starts. When I ordered they said 40-45 minutes for delivery. When an hour had passed I called to see if it was out for delivery yet. The girl who answered the phone was beyond rude, \"well considering our pick ups are taking 45 minutes\" and \"well you did order the pizza well done\". I'm a veteran so pretty polite with strangers and this girl was completely dismissive and rude. Had she just said sorry sir we are running behind you should have it shortly I would have accepted that and probably given them my business again. I will never order from here again and will recommend other to take their business else where."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Think I found my new regular place. The crust looked amazing. Homemade sauce was a little thick, not too sweet, and the perfect combo of Italian herbs. We got a large pie with bacon and hot peppers. Wish we had ordered an XL since their pies run smaller than average. Worth it, will return next time!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get pizza! My parents actually went on their first date here- and they have now been married 30 years! Their sausage is so good- homemade and extremely flavorful. Homemade dough, sauce, it is all amazing. The best place to order pizza from in Plum, in my opinion! The owner is there working every time I stop in. You can tell he really takes pride in his business. You NEED to try their pizza, you won't be disappointed!"}
