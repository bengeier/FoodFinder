{"text":"Growing up in the 70's, Alice was a favorite TV show in our household.  I was feeling a bit nostalgic this morning, so I thought I'd drop by the place and give it a try.  I was glad I did.  FOOD I had the Greek omelette, which was very good.  My son had pancakes, which the cook made into Mickey Mouse.  Of course, I had to try the grits, and they were great.    SERVICE Good.  My son broke a bowl and they were very gracious about it.  ATMOSPHERE Typical old diner.  A little rough around the edges, but the booth and table were clean.  Interesting crowd of old-timers.  Cops, truckers, etc.  There were a few references to the show, including autographed cast photos and an original script on display.  I'd say the new owners are doing a great job bringing a bit of pop culture history back to life.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friday's soup is clam chowder. Really good homemade clam chowder!  Heavy on the clams and light on the salt to let the flavor come through. Locals know to come in and order a bowl for lunch. Burgers are good too, and the service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The service is probably the redeeming quality of this place. They are very welcoming and make you feel at home. It's dingy and kind of dirty but that's just like every other diner. It does take awhile to make your food, but they have amazing egg whites. Visit if you're nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back again."}
{"text":"Didn't they make a movie with Mel's Diner a long time ago? Like American Graffiti or something? Anyways, the tuna melt is sick. In a good way. Real good. Ask for jalapenos with the melt and eat that with some fresh fries and you will know the meaning of \"enjoying the simpler the things in life\" my friend.  Anyways, my friends and I have come here alot. Great place!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, decor could use some sprucing up, but it is an older diner. Overall, I would definitely recommend! Try anything with gravy! The haystack and chicken fried steak were both awesome...and huge!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Mel's every single time I've been there. Note, I've only been for breakfast. This is the diner behind the famous 70's show, Alice. The iconic Mel's sign is still standing. There is some retro throwback to the tv show inside. This is a classic diner. No frills, but great food. The skillets are hearty, the french toast is good, the menu is priced very well, and the service is great. My go to is the country fried steak skillet. There are plenty of options and a lot of daily specials. This is next to the fairground at 17 ave and Grand. I especially enjoy the no upcharge for egg whites. If you want a nostalgic diner experience with good food, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EAT HERE!  YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!! It is so disgusting.  The food tastes like grease and the omlette was scary.  A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!  It reaks of smoke and is just plain nasty.  The only good think about it is the sign.  If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.    And I like diners.  My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Mel's because there were four of us and Bragg's down  the street was way to small. This place seemed run-down and kinda nasty! The bathroom was awful! But all good cuz how can you ruin breakfast? Well I had a sausage omelet with hash browns and pancakes. YUCK! It wasn't even an omelet. It was cooked on flat griddle, overcooked by the way - wasn't fluffy and just didn't look appetizing. Sausage not very flavorful! Hash browns tasted like frozen - cold in spots. Can not recommend, but I'm not from here so try your luck! My friend said his home fries were really good. The refritos on my other friend's plate looked old, like they had been sitting around because they had a hard crust on them. I normally like breakfast at a diner, but, sadly, can  not recommend."}
{"text":"Staff has always been friendly and professional.  There food has always been great, home cookin'.  Ain't nothing fanny, but the food is great.  When I'm downtown, it's the only place i've gone for the last month.  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"My sister and I and her two sons intended on dining at the coffee cup but it was closed by the time we got there. We ended up dining at Mel's diner. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and the service. The french fries were yummy and had a surprising ranch shake on them. They were so good we order more. The pancakes were perfect and my sister had the home made chicken soup and she was loving it. Our total bill was $22 for 2 adults and two children. That is amazing in this day and age. We found out that our server was the owner's daughter and we thought she was so cool and great free spirit!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the people are nice. Good size portions. They have some signature plates and foods that set the them apart from any other breakfast and lunch diner. The outside looks a little old town and looked closed if u drive by but inside it was bustling with people."}
{"text":"Service is awesome - great food. Small and homey - historic building. Amazing fries!! Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I also grew up watching the show, so I wa very excited to take mom and 5yr old nephew and 2 yr old niece here for breakfast. Unfortunately I was very disappointed me and my mom got an omelette and I got 1 for the kids to splitand the bill came to $40. That is kinda high for breakfast. Besides the front of the restaurantthere was nothing that would remind you of the shoe except for a couple of pictureson the wall. The waitresses  should have wore the same pink outfits and overall there was just nothing that got you into the theme that they were trying to lure you in there with I could have even handle the high prices if there would have been more of a theme. The waitress was extremely friendly though"}
{"text":"It's a mom and pop diner. The service is good and the food too. I like the cozy feeling in the restaurant. Lots of local clientele."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Phoenix, first time at Mel's Diner. We stopped for breakfast on our way back to Tucson. The staff was friendly and efficient. The meal was fresh, House Fries were homemade, not frozen. Pancakes were light and fluffy. We spent a little less than we would at IHOP and the food was much better. We'll definitely return to Mel's Diner."}
{"text":"We live in Summerlin but I would totally make the trip to eat bfast at this place again, I cant wait to take my hubby next time. Awesome service, you can tell it is family owned and operated, very clean and organized service. We had a crappy breakfast experience down the street, so I was so relieved to have eaten here. There eggs and hash brown breakfast was honestly very flavorful, there was actual chopped onion in the potatoes and not just onion powder:) Great place!"}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and efficient, place was clean, food was so bad I took activated charcoal when I got home to prevent food poisoning. SO BAD!"}
{"text":"Cheap with good service and food to fill yer pie hole just the way nature intended! Drop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Freindly staff. Get home cooking food for breakfast and lunch. I love the House Club sandwich. The memorabilia from the TV show is cool to look at"}
{"text":"I stopped in Phoenix to have lunch with a friend and he brought me here to Mel's.  He told me Mel's Diner was used for the exterior shots of the '76 to '85 TV sitcom, Alice.  APPEARANCE:  Mel's has seen better days.   The food was still good, but.... let's just say the place is looking and feeling a bit tired.   I went to wash my hands and the restrooms were... basic restrooms, older like the restaurant.   The soap dispenser was empty so I stepped in the woman's to get some soap.   Also when I sat down back at the booth I bottomed out on the springs and the boards supporting them underneath.  2 stars.  SERVICE: It felt like a small local \"diner\" where they are very friendly and everyone knows everyone.   They're always smiling and happy to take care of most any request.  4 stars.  FOOD:  I ordered the pork loin sandwich and my friend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.   Both my friend and our server told me the sandwich I ordered was really big and boy they weren't kidding!    Check out my photos, it could have used 2 buns!   After having a cup of chicken soup, fries and that sandwich, I'd have to say the food is pretty good, yes diner food, but still pretty good none-the-less.   On the plus side, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable!   3.5 stars.  OVERALL:  The food is good, the service is very good and the prices are LOW.   But the building and decor is old and out dated.  I suppose that's how they keep the prices down............  I bet if anyone tells the owner they should remodel, they'll just say \"Kiss My Grits!\"   ;-)"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Prices are reasonable.  I prefer pickles and ketchup with my hambugers, that's all.  I asked for extra pickles and was astounded when the check arrived with a charge for 49 cents for pickles.  Never again."}
{"text":"Came to Mel's for lunch when I was in town for a week going to school.  The best lunch I've ever had.  I had a double burger with fries.  Awesome!  The waitress was awesome!  If I'm ever in town again, I'm going to Mel's."}
{"text":"Wonderful Breakfast/Lunch place just off the highway between Las  Vegas and the Hoover Dam.  The prices were reasonable, the food terrific and the service was very friendly.  They serve breakfast till closing at 3pm.  Our menu choices were a hamburger/fries, tuna sandwich and a chicken ceasar salad.  Unfortunately, no milkshakes.  A bit funky, but the restrooms were immaculate."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome cheap prices, interesting people to ponder, as the other reviewer posted.  I agree, the carpet is downright foul. Matches the busser's  mood..never thought about it, but him being the owner would make sense. I hate walking in here hung over though, because I am always afraid the cops are going to smell the booze wafting from me like some cartoon..."}
{"text":"Now this is a real great place to have breakfast! Hot coffee, and plenty of it, and the food is outstanding. Love the specials and  the corned beef hash was great too. The service is just the way I like it, keep the cup filled and with a smile!"}
{"text":"Nice people and decent food the reviews seem to be a little more generous than warranted but nevertheless a good place for breakfast ."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix Father's day wknd and decided to YELP a place for breakfast.  I was surprised to see Mel's diner actually existed, so i had to see it. Being from NYC i was expecting a tourist trap, it is not. The place looks weather beaten and if it wasn't for the OPEN sign on the door, i would've  turned back. I'm glad i didn't.  I had the Chorizo with eggs, wife had an omelet and kids had pan cakes.  Everybodies breakfast were amazing, and the 3 young ladies working were great. We all enjoyed our visit to Mel's and will go back next time we're in town. Maybe by then they will have replaced the old broken window blinds and the curtains."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome, but I think things have changed here, the owner was very nice and the service was good, but the food has gone downhill, maybe the old chef took his recipe with him/her, I don't know.  I got my regular steak and eggs, and it was no where near what it used to be.  I usually give my wife the hashbrowns, and she only ate one bite, they used to be absolutely amazing, not anymore.  Told the  owner about it and he apologized and said the next meal was on him, but if it's cooked the same way, I'd rather eat at home."}
{"text":"I love this old fashion diner. The service is excellent and the food is awesome. Good old home fashion cooking."}
{"text":"Gotta love this diner near downtown Phoenix and hey the seats have been reconditioned recently which gives your posterior a nice cushy feel. The coffee the specials and the wait staff are all excellent."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to take my parents while they were in town. Let's just say this wasn't one of my finer selections. I called ahead to see if they took reservations since it was noon on a Sunday. They just said \"we close at 2.\" Ok..... My parents called for directions and were told \"I don't know, I only know how to get here from my house.\"   It's a novelty that the movie \"Alice\" was filmed here and the outside was used in stills for the tv show, but other than that there's no reason to attract visitors. The service was not very good, it took awhile for a waitress to take our order. We waited 45 minutes for our food (nothing too complex, eggs, French toast, a salad). I will say the waitress did a great job with quality control because she sent one order of eggs back before it came to us since it wasn't cooked over easy as we'd ordered. Food was mediocre. The potatoes and eggs were dry.   We won't be back. They get 1 star for being featured in \"Alice\" and one star for serving us edible food."}
{"text":"I pass through Boulder City fairly regularly for work, and I would love to give any restaurant here a good rating.  The reason I'm giving this place such a bad rating is not the food, which seemed pretty decent.  But I couldn't concentrate on the food because there was somebody, I'm not sure whether it was a patron or an employee, talking at the top of his lungs about how he'd like to shoot welfare mothers, gay people, hippies, and pretty much everybody else.    I'd rather eat a McDonald's breakfast biscuit, pink slime and all, than listen to that kind of shit again."}
{"text":"food is good ,but they have to re-model those bathrooms they are piss soaked and the smell makes it all the way to the dining room oooff!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best French toast of all time. Love this place. Very good. Ham& cheese omelette is delicious"}
{"text":"I am so sad to write this review.   My December review was a glowing one and since then I went back to try their all you can eat their fish and chips for $9.99  We tried the bargain meal and found it to be delightful.  Didn't bother to write it up because I had already given Mel's Diner a great review so why repeat myself?   We decided to have the fish and chips again.  Why not?  Delicious is delicious, right?   Well today not so much.  The fish was heavy and thick and we discovered why.  The crust was so thick it was an entity onto itself.  I mean rolls of thickness. This was NOT the case the last time we ate it.  I left my food but hubby decrusted all the fish, ate it and did not ask for any more.  This is highly unusual since this is an all you can eat promotion and he can put away quite a bit.  To give you an idea of the heaviness of the crust, please note the photo.  I have never experienced something like this before.  I even thought that the fish I tasted was not fully cooked on the inside because the crust was so thick it kept the fish from fully cooking.   The waitress was nice enough when we explained what was wrong with the fish but it is really not her fault.   Not returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Mel's Diner a hand full of times in the past 6 months.  Nothing fancy, but clean, and comfortable.  The food has been pretty good, portions large, and my coffee cup full.  I love the chili....really good flavor with a bit of heat....service has been good and I have always been able to be in and out in under an hour.    My experience yesterday has me wondering if I will go back.  Two of my coworkers  and I went to Mel's for an early lunch around 11:30.  The place was busy, but once seated, our server (younger female, lots of tats) took our drink order which we got right away and soon after took our food order (3 chef salads and a BLT)...we were engrossed in conversation and about 45 min later we notices most of the other customers had left and we still had not received our food.   We continued to look around for the server.  When spotted she did not make eye contact with us but continued to buss tables and attend to a table in the back room.  When we finally got her attention.....with a really bad attitude, she made excuses about being busy...the other side was full and there was a large group...no apology about the delay...or when our food would be out (the only thing we ordered that required \"cooking\" was the toast for the BLT). She didn't even offer to refill our empty drinks...she went about bussing tables and tending to customers coming in....we were hungry and continued to wait...each time she came around the corner we hoped to see our food, but nothing.  We had to get something to eat and get back to work, so we got up to leave.  When walking up to pay for our drinks, one of the servers thanked us for coming in...our server never said a thing.  We made a comment to the woman at the register about our situation and still no appology.  Just told us how much we owed, and took our money...as we left we saw what appeared to be our order in the window behind the counter....very disappointing.  I've worked in restaurants myself and know things get busy....that's what you hope for in that business, but this is no way to treat customers....we would have stayed if the server had left the nasty attitude behind and apologized for the delay...a refill of our coffee would have been nice too.  Instead, we left and went to McGurkeys....great service...great food."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Don't let the old, vintage sign fool you, Mel's is very clean inside and has great food!  The staff is all friendly and smiling. Ask for Marianna, she will treat you like family! Give this landmark diner a try!  You will not be disappointed!  If you don't like it, kiss my grits! :)"}
{"text":"this iconic diner is awesome and so is the food,   service is good. we had a large group. they adjusted the staff accordingly!!!"}
{"text":"I work downtown, near the capitol, so when a coworker suggested we try Mel's Diner for lunch one day, I was game.  I had passed the place many times, but had no idea it was *the* Mel's Diner made famous from the hit show \"Alice.\"   Being a photographer, I was more interested in visiting for the photo-op than the food  so I knew I just had to bring along my camera and get some shots of this landmark...(http://www.flickr.com/photos/mimiahmedphotography/sets/72157623318556037/).  After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't expecting much food wise.  Low and behold I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd keep it simple, so I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  I was pleased with my meal which arrived in a decent amount of time and was cooked as I had requested-- well done but still juicy.  I had cole slaw as a side which was simple but tasty.  Not bad for a lunch under $10.  The staff was friendly and even the infamous \"Foul-mouthed Frank\" chatted it up with us for a bit and showed off some news clippings he'd saved from articles featuring him in the New Times and others.  Overall, I enjoyed Mel's Diner and have been back since."}
{"text":"Mel's is as charming as the the community that it operates in and just as old.  From what I have read is that it is the longest operating business in BC.  Stopped in solo and took a seat at counter which is a rarity for me.  The menu is small but is not short of tasty looking breakfast or lunch entrees.  I ordered up a Mel's Tasty Treat Omelette.  It consisted of bacon, mushrooms, cheese, potatoes and hash brown.  To drink I ordered coffee.  Ella, my friendly waitress never let the cup below half full.  If you want to trick your mind into believing that you are not in the middle of the desert  and want to embrace a small town feeling if only during the time it takes you to eat a cheap, great tasting meal....then Mel's Diner is the place."}
{"text":"Fun little restaurant in historic Boulder City.  We stopped for breakfast on our way from Vegas to the Hoover Dam.  It's a small restaurant with limited seating for larger parties.  It's a biscuits and gravy kind of place.  Great chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food!!! The wife and I stopped by this place remembering how tasty the steak was like 3 years ago......Not this time! This so called steak tasted like liver, they should have put onions on top of it. The wife ate one piece and left the rest she ate the eggs and toast. I had a few pieces but it was way too over seasoned. The hasbrowns were not fresh, like they used to be. We decided: never again Mel's"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday afternoon. All employee's were busy doing something useful. Always a good sign. The food was so good. I had a patty melt with fries. Order came with a cup of homemade chicken noodle soup. It was Fantastic!! All hit the spot. Waitress was very friendly and service was prompt. I will return and try liver and onions and a slice of pie. Hope it's just as good. I'm betting it is."}
{"text":"The food was what one would expect from the outside. Mel's is not a hole in the wall place with amazing food. It's diner with decent food for decent prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. It's nearby so I go. Sadly they had no T-shirts for sale.  One would think that they would capitalize off the TV history."}
{"text":"Great food,and a fun place. Spotted this place months ago,and decided to try it  Photos of the cast from the show Alice are around.  The place itself needs some work,  but it was fun to see the filming location.  Would love to see the outside sign restored, as it is a Phoenix landmark."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast food, come here. If you want an amazingly large sandwich, come here. If you want a small town vibe in the oldest restaurant in town, come here. You will leave stuffed and you will have a huge portion. It's the ideal stop before you head off to explore the Hoover Dam. GET THE FRIES. THEY ARE AMAZING."}
{"text":"Went for a ride, and needed food for the journey.  Since I was unimpressed with the \"world famous\" place a few doors down, we wanted to try Mel's on for size.  While a bit small inside, the food was A+!  Even if there's a wait, this will be our \"go to\" in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This is A historical restrant. Very nice people. Great location. Easy parking. Fast and easy. Good food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, it was quiet and very nice. I like good food in a diner. I had a sausage omelette. The food was good the staff was nice, and I didn't get rushed to eat nor pay. I will most def, revisit this place. Thank you for the good eats."}
{"text":"We are frequent patrons of The Coffee Cup in Boulder City and wanted to try a different place so we decided to try Mel's Diner. Great place, really good food, we got stuffed, and the waitress gal works so hard she has to wear athletic shoes! We met the nice owner  who lives in the community, and when you eat at locally owned businesses you keep the money in the community. We will be back to Mel's Diner a lot now that we know it is awesome, for breakfast and lunch too!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 11:50am.. I got my food at 12:30pm. The food was fantastic but the service can use a little work.  The servers seemed stressed and hectic and the dishwasher was walking around giving dirty looks and slamming things. The service was slow and the cooks were behind and were being yelled at by the manager.   The restaurant was pretty clean except the dirty dish bin located underneath the bar counter. I ordered a burger with onion rings.  The burger  was juicy and very tasty. The onion rings were also fantastic.  Reminded me of burger king onion rings. I would consider coming back to try a different item on the menu"}
{"text":"ROACHES!!!! Sat down less than two minutes and out popped two of their little greeters, one on the wall and the other on  the  table.  Told the waitress and she shrugged and asked what I wanted to drink and if I was ready to order. No apology and no \"oh let me take care of that...\".  I  couldn't believe that she shrugged it off. If they are so comfortable with it I could imagine how the kitchen must look. Got up and left. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"There's just something comforting about a place as resolutely old school as Mel's.  Even though this Sunday morning was my first visit, for some reason it just felt like I was visiting an old friend.  Whereas Welcome Diner (just a couple miles east of here) serves diner fare with modern and new age twists, Mel's menu remains old school and proud of it.  The diner itself has been relatively untouched by time (even though ownership has changed hands a few times).  Before I came here I guess I was expecting something along the lines of faux nostalgia with 50s music blaring in the background and waitresses in sock hop outfits (along the lines of Phoenix's 5 & Diner franchises).  Nope.  Unpretentious, laid back, friendly, and affordable.  Great reviews from the Phoenix New Times got me in the door.  The verdict?  The restaurant is situated on Grand Avenue just north of the I-10 freeway and about two blocks directly south of the State Fairgrounds.  The immediate surrounding neighborhood has certainly seen better days, but Mel's has endured at this location since 1963.  You may have heard all about the references to Mel's place in history as the setting for the late 70s-early 80s TV sitcom Alice, but I won't go into that since I never saw the show.  Instead you can just Google it and learn for yourself.  For me, my first visit was all about getting a hearty Sunday morning breakfast.  I arrived a few minutes after 7am.  To my surprise the front counter was almost full and several people were already grabbing spots in the surrounding booths.  The majority of the clientele were retirees who are clearly on a first name basis with Becky (the head waitress this morning) and with each other.  The restaurant is larger than it looks from the outside and can probably seat about 100 people at full capacity.  I grabbed a chair at the end of the front counter.  As I said, the menu here is old school so if you're looking for a menu item that stands out or something innovative to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed.  But I was here specifically for something old school.  So for me it was a sausage omelet with hash browns and a mini stack of pancakes to get my Sunday morning started.  Food came out in about 5 minutes.  I was actually quite impressed with how much meat they put in my omelet (at least 50/50 meat to egg ratio in this version) and the potatoes and pancakes were both spot on.  Nothing fancy, nothing new age.  Just good down home comfort food.  All the while, I would listen to the restaurant patrons share stories with Becky, with one another and even with patrons sitting at booths at the other side of the room.  Even I jumped in to ham it up with some of the old timers.  I was in and out of here in about 30 minutes, but I suspect many of the other patrons probably spend hours just drinking their coffees and spending time with their groups of friends here regularly.  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to just under $10.  Interestingly Mel's actually reminded me most of some of the diners I used to frequent during my college days in Flagstaff.  Places like Mike & Ronda's (which has a location in Glendale as well), and even Country Host.  These are spots that serve old school, inexpensive comfort food in a laid back, welcoming atmosphere.  People from all walks of life would pop into these places (as I'm sure is the case at Mel's).  College students, truckers, suits, families, people down on their luck, you name it.  In fact if you're a Downtown Phoenix college student and reading this I would highly recommend Mel's as a spot for a good hearty breakfast or lunch on a college budget.  For me, Mel's was a surprisingly decent find with food that was both familiar and top notch.  For over half a century, Mel's has been a survivor in a ever changing Phoenix landscape.  And my tummy couldn't be more grateful."}
{"text":"I love the old diner feel--not old look new but truly old.  Had a standard breakfast of poached eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast.  All was fine, none was the best I ever had but there isn't much one can do to fancy up a poached egg.   Went at 11am on a Sunday and there was no crowd."}
{"text":"Was starving after a motorcycle ride to Grand Canyon, stopped here for the first time. 3 of us had the Cheeseburger combo plate that the friendly manager recommended. It was Excellent ! Fries were crisp and the burger was very very good !!"}
{"text":"Good food at a very reasonable price. I was able to get two tasty, thick pancakes, 4 slices of bacon and two eggs with all you can drink coffee for less than $8.00. The food has lost of flavor and everything was cooked properly. Its a dive dinner, but the food is great."}
{"text":"Mel's has some of the best clam chowder in town.  My friends meet at Mel's once a month.  Everyone always comments on how large the servings are.  Wait staff is friendly.  Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but pricey! Not the best location and a bit run down in the front. Inside the place is kept clean and tidy. Worth the one time trip."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit the diner which the show Alice was based upon.  Cool, old fashioned diner with nice service, but seriously how can you run out of grits on a Saturday morning when everyone comes to Mel's Diner for some \"kiss my grits\"?!?  The food was pretty good though...I enjoyed a gyro omelette, but still disappointed about the lack of grits."}
{"text":"Mel's Diner Review dated for 6.8.13  Intro: We were looking for a place to eat on the way from Vegas to the grand canyon. We stumbled upon this place. This pace is as dinery as a diner can get.   Wood panelling,Check! 1950's style wall decor,Check! Very small dining area,Check! 1950's style sign out front,Check!  It was kinda neat. The waitress was even perky and prompt.    Order 1 (mine) I ordered a chef salad. It was huge and I ate half in the diner and half on the road. Filled me up nicely. Had lots of meat.   Order 2 (sis) had a burger that was gluten free. The manager (I think he was the manager) accomodated very well she liked her burger a lot.  Order 3 (mom) salad. She liked it.  Service: Very good for a small town diner. The manager was accomodating to my sis's gluten free needs and even showed her the seasoning bottle so she can verify the contents. She wanted breakfast type food but the seasoning had wheat based product in it so she declined and got a burger instead. Waitress was prompt as well.   Overall: recommended and I was suprized to see a small town diner that accomodated gluten free people."}
{"text":"I can take it or leave it I don't know I've seen some reviews that said it was nice and clean but when I was there it was kind of dingy. And it seemed like the waitresses kept forgetting that I was sitting there"}
{"text":"This place is old school local history. Go here. Save yourself the wait at the place down the street. Got the Haystack... hashbrowns, sausages, eggs, biscuits, all smothered in awesome sausage gravy, lots of gravy.  LOTS!"}
{"text":"Underrated and overlooked. Mel's for breakfast is awesome! Generous portions at a fair price."}
{"text":"We stopped at Mels Diner on our way to see the Hoover Dam. We got there about 9AM and had no trouble finding a parking spot right across the street.  The place was busy when we entered, the only table available was one in the back corner of the room, against 2 walls. It was only my wife and I so this was OK in terms of space, but somewhat odd looking at the wall.  Service was slow, but I attribute that to the number of folks in the restaurant at the time. All of the staff were multi-tasking and hustling to get things done.  I had the western omelette and my wife had the Country Friend Steak. Both meals satisfied and filled us up. Coffee was good and they did a pretty good job of keeping the cups full."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday with a party of four and came away impressed!  We came in and were acknowledged immediately with the waitress letting us know to seat ourselves wherever.  Drink orders were taken immediately.  The staff were very attentive, constantly refilling our drinks and it was nice to see that she knew names of most of the patrons enjoying their breakfasts.  The food was really good, quick from the grill and accurate.  I was impressed as we had a pretty large order!  The 1 star removed is for the bathrooms, as they clearly showed their age and need to be updated.  I would easily go back to this place again and look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"What a rude waitress! Was waiting for 10 mins but she was \" busy \" socializing w other waitress.   Them started to get forks and put bread toast together instead of take my order!  Nope! I am paying my money to someone else picker for a good service.  Sorry for the owner  and his loosing customers!"}
{"text":"First, ignore all of the old reviews.   That's a shortcoming of Yelp, that somehow in their default sort, a 4 year old review is higher than a week old one.  Ignore the oldies.  I've lived in PHX my whole life and driven past this literally hundreds of times.  I heard they had new ownership and were giving it a better go.  Mission accomplished.  We went for breakfast.  I had a fantastic gyros/feta/tomato/onion omelette.  The price and side dishes were great too.  Dad had a sausage and egg skillet and it was about twice the size of anything at Denny's or IHOP.   Like all real diners, I'm there must be a Greek involved because gyros/feta/tzatziki pop up here and there on the menu.  Some of the old reviews knock the decor,  It's been freshened and they removed the old flooring revealing absolutely beautiful real terrazo floors.  Yes, it's still a bit dumpy (especialy near the enterance and the bathrooms) but hey- it's a REAL 50 year old, highway-side diner.  Go to Ruby's or 5 and Diner if you prefer your realty to be fake.  The service was perfect, friendly, confident, fast and everyone helped - 3 waitresses and a busboy were nearly fighting to keep our coffee full.  Can't wait to go back for the \"hand cut and huge\" pork loin sandwich which besides a side dish, includes  cup of really good looking chicken soup.  I've only been there once, but anyone who knocks this place fails to understand what a true diner is.  Edit and Update:  After my 2nd visit, I am lowering it from my previous rating of 4 stars to 3.   I hyped it to friends and we all went there for gyros.  They were out today.   But the main reason for the demotion was the bathrooms.  They are just nasty.  Quaint and old is okay at the right time and place, but the bathrooms are trashed, worn out, dirty and poorly maintained.  Step it up in the can!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on the way to Laughlin....great atmosphere, good food, low prices & outstanding service.   It's really a four star place but I'm giving it 5 to offset the review by Erica D. who gave this place one star but thinks Starbucks and Target are worthy of 5 Star reviews.  Chicken Fried Steak and Breakfast Sandwiches we ordered were both good.  I would eat  at Mel's Diner again if passing through Boulder City."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, even better service. Eggs cooked perfectly, crispy hash browns, sausage a little dry.  Biscuits were fair. Menu looks inviting for lunch. When one goes for an early breakfast smiling faces are appreciated, everyone in this place looked happy in their job."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and the food is made to order. Fresh and hot. The place is old but clean. It is in need of an update."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for a long time. I grew up watching the Alice TV Show and sort of forgot Mel's Diner really is in Phoenix. I didn't expect great culinary wonders here after all it's MEL'S DINER but the food REALLY was better than I expected.  I looked at the menu and it was pretty basic so I thought grilled cheese or hamburger and went with hamburger. To my surprise they gave us cups of chicken noodle soup. The soup was home made and had fresh carrots and celery in it and the noodles were surprisingly fresh and not gooey.  My hamburger ($5.99) was 7 oz. of fresh hand packed meat. I did need to add salt and pepper to it but it was very juicy and tasted very fresh. It was better than I thought it would be. The fries were just your average frozen fries just a tad better than Burger King.  For $5.99 I think they deserve an AOK plus a Childhood Memory was fulfilled."}
{"text":"Hello Mel's Diner on a Labor Day weekend!! My friend suggested this place to eat.  His suggestion is right!! This place is good!! We ordered the California Omelette and Country Chicken Fried Steak.  The service and food were excellent.  If your in the area visiting Hoover Dam, stop by this diner.  Its a cozy diner!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know this was the original set for the tv series until I went inside. It's a shame how run down this place is. Their crew were nice, but you would think they would have some kind of uniform policies? But their food were very good, I have been here twice and both times it took them some time to get our food out."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this is the original Mel's Diner from Alice,the TV show. Good food, excellent service, good prices. The neighborhood is a bit less than elegant but so what. I enjoyed my breakfast experience at Mel's."}
{"text":"Ordered steak and eggs. The hash browns were the best I've ever had. Seriously. The onions they prepare them with makes a world of a difference. Steak was flavorful and tender. Windows display a friendly view of boulder city's district area. Loved it!"}
{"text":"5 stars to their service and to their country gravy! I can bathe in this stuff it's so good. I top and or mix with the hash browns. This place is very small and not much space to move around in. I am surprised they can accommodate as many patrons as they do.   Not recommended: The steak. I ordered the steak and eggs and their steak is very flat, not much meat and I had ordered it medium rare and it came out extremely well done. Too tough and lacks flavor. I am not much of a complainer. So I didn't say anything about it.   The gravy put me at ease. Seriously it's that good! YUM!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch today. Upon entering we were greeted immediately and decided to sit at the counter.  Shortly after being seated I noticed a guy to our left get his credit card out and was ready to pay his bill and leave. It took him nearly 10 minutes to get anyone's attention. Watching him being ignored made us feel a bit uncomfortable as well.  I ordered the cheese burger and fries my girlfriend ordered the blt.   Her order was finished and put out to be delivered to her. By the time a waitress got around to bringing it to her it was cold.  We never were given silverware and had to ask a neighbor at the counter if she could slide some of the other silverware over to us.  My cheeseburger was excellent, the fries were soso. The blt might have been good were it not cold.  The place seemed clean and the staff was friendly enough when they were around.  Their major problem is a major lack of attentiveness."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Mel's Diner on Sunday,February 9.I figured that any place that had been open since 1931 couldn't be too bad and must have something going for it.We both had omelets and we were both satisfied with the quality of our food,the size of the portions and the price.I had noticed some of the reviewers had complained about excessive waiting times for their food,but we encountered no such problems.It took us 7 minutes from the time we placed our orders to the time our food was served to us.We both enjoyed the place and I would not hesitate to eat here again.I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great diner food!  When we arrived, there was a wait for a table, but the counter was open.  Be aware, there is not much room at the counter.  I am 5'8\" and my knees barely fit.  And, if you have a belly, you might not fit at all!  My breakfast was delicious (western omelette with green chili instead of onions) - and I believe it was the envy of my fellow counter eaters.  My friend got 1 biscuit with gravy and it would have been two meals for me - very large biscuit!  Service was great.  The food can be a bit on the slow side if they are packed, but they do prepare your food in the order that orders are taken."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , old style diner, prices and selection are decent. Don't let the exterior fool you. Has a small town feel."}
{"text":"Sandwiches!  I come here randomly but I love this place! Lots of great memories!  Typical diner fare, but their BLT is really fresh tasting! I'm kind of boring so I always just get the BLT.  A little heads up- This place can be a little slow."}
{"text":"It was so neat visiting Mel's, the inspiration for the diner used in the old TV series \"Alice.\" The food was wholesome and tasty. Definitely very good and ranking a notch or so below some of my very favorite diners, so above average though not quite in a league of its own. The chicken fried steak and eggs breakfast was worth ordering as was the clubhouse sandwich. The vanilla milkshake was exceptionally good tasting creamy and sweet without being hyper-sweet as most other places make their shakes.  If in the downtown Phoenix area Mel's Diner is absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Servers were awesome!  Had the Pork Tenderloin sandwich and it was incredible. Just like I used to get back I the Midwest!  Complimentary Chicken Noodle soup was also fantastic. Only think I didn't like was the potato salad."}
{"text":"Driving past Mel's Diner, I told my boyfriend, \"We have to eat breakfast here before we leave town!\"  For those of us who remember back that far, the TV series \"Alice\" was set in Mel's Diner in Phoenix.  Only now, the new \"Flo\" wears jeans & a t-shirt and has a tattoo and an eyebrow ring.  The food was what you would expect...it's just a hole in the wall diner after all!  Actually the breakfast was pretty good, and the prices are pretty cheap compared to a lot of breakfast places.  The bacon was tastier than at most cafes.     Funky interior, about the sort of garage sale decor items you see at a lot of places like this one.  Though there was a cool old mirror in the bathroom, set just about waist height so you can check out how your pants fit after you ate a big breakfast.   Lots of regulars seem to come in and the people watching is somewhat fascinating."}
{"text":"Came for the nostalgia...   stayed for some breakfast.  Had the ham and cheese omelet very big and loaded... hash browns nice and crispy....  pancakes were ok....  added a side of grits....   which definitely were not worthy of a \"Kiss my grits from Flo\"!!!!  This Texas girl knows good grits and these were not on par..... overall a quaint little diner with good breakfast"}
{"text":"Went to Mel's for lunch, we were greeted immediately and had drinks in front of us right away.  I ordered the turkey club with a side of potato chowder and it was EXCELLENT!  The sandwich was absolutely delish and the soup was amazing. The fries were seasoned and equally delicious.  The servers were friendly and attentive.   The food was delivered fast and hot.  When I was deliberating about the soup they brought me a sample to try it first (which as I already said it was amazing!).  I will definitely be stopping back in and often!  -Jen K."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars but I'm saving that for a meal that gives me an orgasm. This place was close! Super clean, friendly staff and fast service. The food had a home made feel and was prepared perfectly. Some of the nicest and funny waitresses yet and they never let my coffee get cold. Very reasonable prices. Five star worthy."}
{"text":"I've been here before with family in the past, normally the food and service is good. Today we've waited an hour and a half to receive all of our food, plate by plate. It took 30 minutes for my family member to be told they didn't have something available and that he had to change his order. There's nothing wrong with changing the order but being told right away would have great. Disappointed. I was 27 years old when i came in to eat and now I'm 35 years old and still waiting for my pancakes and the check.  I helped a woman birth her child because of the wait."}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends here for breakfast. Definitely a spot with early morning regulars, Several of the diners were greeted by name when they came in. Serving sizes were generous. The waitress was pleasant and kept our coffee cups filled. I would most likely try a different menu selection next time."}
{"text":"Loving this place it is real. They filmed here food is outstanding. Love all the history of this place worth checking out."}
{"text":"We've been driving by this place for years and decided to stop for an omelette. As you would expect, the place has pics from the tv sitcom \"Alice\" all over the place. The omelette was very good and the wait staff checked in on us a few times...a refreshing change from the corporate restaurants...we may have to make Mel's a staple in our \" let's go somewhere different for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, THAT Mel's Diner!  Cool place and good food."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from Hoover Dam for lunch. We enjoyed lunch, the country fried steak is outstanding, as are the \"french onion\" french fries...Small diner, very laid back. Would recommend if you want a decent cheap meal."}
{"text":"Classic diner with excellent food and service."}
{"text":"We love Mel's Diner and have been coming here for years. They have excellent service and fabulous food. We have had many different breakfast and lunch options and all are very good. I am particularly fond of the gyro Omelet and my hubby likes their pork chops and eggs. Come visit. I don't think you will be disappointed. We never are!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their breakfast burrito, or should I say, their Serrano chili salsa. It is so (Boulder) Dam good. I keep wanting to try something else. My parents love their soups and sandwiches, but I just have to have that salsa. The prices are great. It is in one of the oldest buildings in BC and the owners have deep roots in Boulder City, having been teachers at the local high school. The only reason why I am why I am not giving Mel's a 5 star rating, is because they serve Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to the Hoover Dam hoping to get a quick bite for breakfast. Well nothing about Mel's is quick. The tester aunt was almost empty and it took them forever just to take our order. We should have left then. We ordered pancakes, French toast, eggs and bacon. It took then 45-60minuted to have our food out. Needless to say we were extremely frustrated and disappointed with the food. The food itself was fine but definitely not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"this place isn't too bad.   yeah, there is a weird musty smell, but you get used to it. The last time I was in there the smell of mildew and pee was very prominent, but I toughed out the stench and still ate there.  The food is good and decently priced.   The busser (Frank, I think is his name) is very surly, but really it's part of his charm. I think he is a riot.  My other complaint besides the odd smell is my last visit there the service was not very good. Normally I've had good service, but this day the service was bad. One lady came up to me and my husband while talking on her cell phone and asked us what we wanted to drink then she would start talking on her cell phone. She came back only with my ice tea and forgot my husbands coffee. Then we had a different lady come up to us to take our order. We were there nearly 15 minutes before she came to take our order. They weren't busy at all on this day and we were the only other couple sitting in her section, so I don't understand what the hold up was.  Other than that experience the other times I've eaten here the food and service have always been decent."}
{"text":"Fun historic place to eat where the television show \"Alice\" was filmed.  Good food and friendly service in a clean, classic diner setting."}
{"text":"Hubby & I picked out this place for breakfast on our road trip from Vegas to the Grand Canyon.  We were immediately impressed because most of the food on the Vegas strip is pretty damn expensive and this place was cheap to reasonable.   I had the omelette with has browns & a biscuit. Loved my biscuit although it was lacking a golden brown color to it, it was a pale biscuit, my omelette was giant and amazing. I think I might have eaten my whole breakfast.   The coffee was alright, I don't know what it was about Nevada but I couldn't really find a good cup of coffee there during my visit. The only places that had good coffee were Starbucks and they charged more money than in NY and a place I discovered on my last day called the coffee bean which was also a chain. There was also a nice little place called the coffee cup where we also found pretty good coffee.   If you stay in Vegas and rent a car I would recommend taking a short drive to Boulder City for breakfast here and at the coffee cup."}
{"text":"If you like flies and rude service then this is the place for you. (It also smells bad)"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Sunday morning to have some breakfast and to take pictures. All of the servers were very friendly and took great care of us. They were not very busy and we got our food within about 10 minutes. I had biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs over easy, and sausage patties. The sausage was yummy, biscuits and gravy were average, and the eggs were undercooked to the point that when I broke the yolk it was like water all over the plate. The husband had eggs, bacon, hash browns , and toast. He thought it was comparable to Denny's ...so just average.   The best parts about this place is the nostalgia, the prices, and the service. We paid about $12 for 2 meals, coffee, and soda. I may be back again : )  And there were very interesting types of people coming in and out, this kept me entertained the whole time. Also a great couple sitting next to us bought a homeless guy some food....that was nice of them...I was going to do it ....I swear I was...they just beat me to it : ("}
{"text":"This is place is cute and basic with some nostalgia... Our food was really great and the service is amazing! We both are born and raised in Phoenix and have never been here. Great experience!"}
{"text":"At 6:30 AM I think the morning rush was already over. There were only a few obvious regulars at the counter, not the larger collection of ranchers and truckers and locals I remember from a few years ago.  The few at the counter were talking utility rates and solar and weather in general and another a few seats away chimed in on conspiracy theories of it all being the result of government manipulation of the weather at some top secret government antenna installation in Texas where they'll shoot you if you get within 3 feet of the fence, and quickly got to Roswell and Area 51 from there. People watching (and eavesdropping) at its finest, but I digress . .   I've only been to Mel's about  4 times but have never had a bad meal and the prices have always been reasonable or better.  This morning's meal was the 1/2 waffle special with 2 eggs in your style of choice, and 2 strips of bacon: $5.29.  Apparently endless refills of coffee: about $1.85. The waffle was I presume out of a box and was unspectacular but okay, and had an unusual just slight taste of salt.  My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the  two strips of bacon, if a little skinny for a bacon lover, were quite good.  I went in craving grits but to my disappointment there were no grits to kiss nor to even shake hands with this morning as they were out. As a Southerner, I commend and recommend the grits, as I have had them in the past at Mel's, not instant, cooked perfectly, neither runny nor semi-solid mass or mess.  The pancake's I've had in the past were perfectly cooked, generously portioned, and really good and really really filling.     My server this morning was in classic diner uniform with hip hair and a few visible tatts and piercings thrown in, but not too much to be off-putting to my semi aged sensibilities.  She was clean, competent, and quick with the service: my coffee never had a chance to get more than an inch down in the cup before a refill was on the way.     The place seemed, well - cleaner than I remembered from a couple of visits a few years ago.  .  My table and the tables throughout the place were clean, and there was not even dust on the window sill at my booth. There was no debris on the floor, food or otherwise anywhere in the dining area, front or back. And no musty smell.  I suspect the indoor smoking ban was not welcomed by many of the old time regulars, but there's a definite improvement in the atmosphere, probably in no small part due to removing some (or all?) of the old carpet.  The men's room has a single, very low to the ground toilet with a slightly over-size horseshoe seat, and a handicap bar on the wall that I'd bet many non-handicapped climb to get up off that toilet.  The toilet, semi ancient in appearance though it was, appeared to be clean.  The sink was of modern vintage, was also clean.  Both faucet handles functioned perfectly, though with the sound effect of a haunted house door when turned.  The wall below the sink where the plumbing came through might could use a little touching up, but no major lack of sanitation.  The soap, TP, and paper towel dispensers were stocked, and there was no trash on the floor.     Yes, the place is worn, but that's part of its Americana charm, and thankfully without a single goose in a bonnet with a ribbon tied around its neck in sight.  If you know (and miss) the classic American small town or roadside diner, I think there's a good chance you'll appreciate and enjoy Mel's both for the atmosphere and the food. It may not be \"gourmet\", but it's good, and the atmosphere (air), cleaner than it used to be!"}
{"text":"I went to Mel's after my hike today to have some breakfast and get some coffee into my system.    I sat at one of the few empty seats at the counter.  Everyone at the counter had a place mat that said \"I Love Coffee\" and had different shaped mugs on the mat.  I had a placemat that said \"Dallas Cowboys.\"  That's going to be a LOT to overcome to get a good rating from me.  Given that, my server was right there with coffee and she gave me time to look at the menu.  When she came back, I was ready and I ordered the Lake Mojave omelette with sausage, green chili, mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese.  I had my choice of hash browns or something more healthy and the hash browns come with or without onions.  I went all in and got the onions, too.  I took in the ambiance of Mel's and the locals who were at the counter and before long, the server brought my omelette and toast.  I did, however, have to flag down the other server to get some utensils.  Evidently Cowboys and their fans eat with their hands.  Breakfast was very good.  I had coffee refills quickly and the service was really good except for that small utensil thing."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon?  Of course.  It looks like it's in an industrial area of town.  Denver omelette was really good with a side of grits and coffee.  First timer that came back the next morning.  Service was quick and everyone was very nice.  Easy to get to.  Stomach was full and mouth was happy.  Coming again next Spring Training.  Is it really the \"Mel's Diner\" from Alice?  Who knows, but who cares?"}
{"text":"Yum! Good quality ingredients and decently fast service. Found on yelp and glad we went. We were all happy with our food. Will come back if we go to Hoover Dam again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere reminds me of the old diners I used to go to growing up reasonable prices and good service and highly recommended"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? We love the food at Mel's diner but today was the last time we will visit. The food is still great but service sucks. Apparently there is a new owner and he doesn't like a lot of tickets in the kitchen therefore if there are tables who have ordered you can't order your food until their order is complete. Here is a thought, don't own and operate a restaurant. Secondly it's a breakfast joint, breakfast is the easiest and the quickest meal you can make. We watched 2 tables leave as they were told you can sit but it will be a 45 minute wait for your food. I mean come one this place is barely bigger than my living room and people have to wait that long to eat. I'm so angry and I feel this place is a joke. I truly hope some wakes this man up before he is telling his employees to go stand in the unemployment line. P.S. you know you are in for a wait when your waitress brings you a game to play while waiting for your food. I kid you not they brought us a game!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling this joint will be failing. Love the food but the wait time now for the food is ridiculous. The owner or new manager runs the place like a prison. You are a joke! I feel bad for the employees cause they are always great."}
{"text":"I came here for the nostalgia and was pleasantly surprised that the food was yummy too! If we want to keep places like these open, we have to keep supporting them. Be a shame to lose a place like this"}
{"text":"Not your average diner and completely nostalgic so why not stop! There is a secret menu which I'm not completely sure what's on it but if you talk with a regular you'll soon find out.   I went with a friend who ordered off the \"secret menu\", banana pancakes which looked yummy! I on the other hand ordered a single pancake and it was pretty good. I ordered eggs and bacon, nothing was greasy which is refreshing especially for eating at a diner.   There are daily specials which are priced well. I definitely will go back if in the area."}
{"text":"LOVE!!!  This made my holiday vacation! Thank you for the nostalgia! It would be awesome if the waitresses spoke like or said the sayings of the actors/ actresses! Service was great and food matched!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The family I went to boulder city for the fourth of july And we had to stop off at mel's diner After reading all the reviews. I don't know if it was because of the fourth of july And they are usually not open But this was not a very good experience. I ordered the big bang burger And all that it has on it What a burger swiss cheese and lettuce. The burger was cold and not very tasty. My wife had the philly steak and her meat was cold too. I will have to say That their french fries were  very good. The service was good and the owner is very nice. I will probably give them another try the next time I'm through boulder city."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally get to the famous Mel's Diner ! It was exactly the way I thought it would be like . The original sign outside , and the diner , like I remembered on the television show . The food was delicious , and the staff was friendly. Prices were very good . You get a lot of food ! I can't wait to go back again !"}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Grand Avenue.   Don't let the location and outside of the building scare you off.  Good service and good food.  Prices are average.  The omelette with sausage and cheese was great.  The sausage patties are huge.  Wheat toast was perfect."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. The exterior is original for the 70's. The inside is clean and renovated. This place has its regulars which should speak for itself, the servers are very attentive and friendly.  The food is your usual diner fare no twists and frivolity Ed. It's the original location for the sitcom Alice so there is a little nostalgia. Over all its a good place to eat breakfast or lunch, i would come back again."}

{"text":"We are a small group of ladies that call ourselves the 2nd. sat. club. Each lady picks a breakfast place for her month.  This time it was Mel'sI Diner.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in, seated and soon had water and coffee.  The food was typical diner fare. Simple, good, reasonable.  They have not tried to reinvent breakfast.    I think every one should try Mel's since it is a Phoenix icon.  If you are a snob or snooty don't bother, after all it is a nostalgic diner."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I still had on my TO DO List from last year so I thought I'd take advantage of the lazy day and head to Boulder City and kill 2 birds with one stone.  At first I went to the Coffee Cup but at Noon they had a 30 minute wait so I headed to Mel's to grab some breakfast.  Mel's is a classic small town diner. The owners Operate the place it has a small counter a couple of boothes and 10-12 tables closely situated all with red  & white checkered tableclothes.  This place has a history as the oldest operating business in the city. There are several pictures on the walls documenting it. There is also one TV in the corner.  The service is very fast & friendly and the food was just like momma used to make. The gravy was thick with nice chunks of sausage and the Chicken Fried Steak was excellent. The sirloin I was able to cut with my fork and the hashbrowns were crispy and very buttery.  Good Coffee,Good Food and Good Service-what else could you want.  A terrific home made breakfast."}
{"text":"Very solid! Driving through And stopped in for a bite.  Great move. It hit the spot!! Good Job Mel!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize there really was a Mel's Diner.  I thought it was just a tv.  I ordered a burger and fries and the burger looks home cooked.  It was so yummy.  The service was fast and the prices are reasonable.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"i came here with my friends last weekend and i must say the food was so good ! fair prices. and everyone that worked there was so nice and friendly. it really was a great environment. i met the owners and they were very nice. they happened to be from cali as well. they talked to me and we talked back and forth about California and gave me some kool insights about boulder and even Vegas. they were super sweet and i really look forward to coming back on my next trip ! Thanks MELS ! we will be back!"}
{"text":"I swear this place is a cover for some type of organized crime (Russian, maybe?) but hot damn if they don't have the best home fries in all of our fair land (that includes Matt's Big Breakfast... I know, right?) They always cook everything to perfection and it tastes really fresh. It's also the location of the original Mel's Diner TV show (EDIT: Korina and Pierre have brought some conflicting facts about this statement to my attention. So when I say \"Really!\" in the next sentence, I actually mean \"Not Really!\"). Really!  Okay, here's what blows: -Disgusting carpet. -Awful bathrooms -Let's just say the waitresses (all are remarkably sexy in a scrappy exotic gangster kind of way... I guess you really have to see for yourself) are less than happy to be serving you. That goes for the \"busboy\" who, with the way he barks at the servers and talks shit about customers, is probably the owner. Actually, this guy kind of rules. So, back to the bitchy server girls. They never wear any clothing that could possibly be misconstrued as appropriate. Always teeny tiny jeans and shirts to match. So strange. -The decor is ridiculous. It's overly patriotic. -The clientele is a mixed bag of cops (cool), tweakers (uncool... but they get booted pretty fast), grizzled old men (intimidating, but cool), and aging republicans, complete with anti-everythingelsebutamerica sentiments emblazoned across greasy shirts (SO obviously not something I like).   All in all, this place is about food and people watching. And, if you like those games where you make up stories about random passersby, you will have a field day with these people."}

{"text":"Mel's Diner in Boulder City is the best breakfast in Boulder! It is located in the oldest building in the city and the tiny diner is cozy and full of charm. Mel's is open daily for breakfast and lunch and offers customers yummy daily specials. The diner serves excellent biscuits, gravy and omelettes-nothin' fancy, just yummy breakfast on your plate. Next time you are in Boulder City be sure to stop in and try it out!"}
{"text":"Was in the area visiting a friend and came across this little diner (that I guess was featured in a show before my time).  The selection of food is just what you expect from a diner, quality is good and everything I had was done well.  The waitress was friendly and they move pretty quickly. I'll be back if in the area"}
{"text":"Had to try Mel's - grew up on Alice     My first impression was 'this is a place that has a lot of regulars' and I know why!   Best pancakes I have had in a while - and as I ate, my impression was confirmed.   Waitresses knew so many customers by name and knew about their lives.   Very friendly fast and efficient.   Fun to see old photos on the wall too."}
{"text":"If your on the road to a greasy spoon, Mel's Diner would be the wrong fork to take. Mel's Diner isn't a greasy spoon. It is a charming restaurant that serves breakfast and sandwiches in a historical downtown Boulder City building dating back to 1931.   I have been spending a lot of time in Boulder City. Mostly hiking. The truth is that hikers pour money into the local economy. Before hiking the Arizona Hot Springs trail I was going to pour some of my money at Mel's Diner.   Mel's Diner is nothing like the TV show. It is a charming eatery that markets itself as being the oldest building in Boulder City. There were no obnoxious waitresses saying \"Kiss my grits.\" When I walked inside, the friendly hostess asked me where I preferred to sit. I chose the tables to the right over the counter stools to the left. I'd notice that the single people were dining at the counter stools where the families were dining at the tables.     A minute after being seated, the friendly hostess became the friendly waitress. She let me take my time ordering while she served me the coffee. Just like the majority of diner coffee, the taste was ok. When I looked at the menu, the majority of the choices were breakfast related. For example,  there is a menu devoted to omelettes. This makes sense on account of the fact that Mel's Diner closes at 3 'o' clock. I'd order the sandwich that never has failed me: a B.L.T  on sordough bread with seasoned fries. The B.L.T. passed my quality assurance test. When the bread collapses on a B.L.T. it fails the test. Not the case at Mel's Diner. The sandwich and fries were quality food. Mel's Diner was anything but a greasy spoon.    The friendly waitress was on top of the coffee refills. And most of all she did not rush me. I felt relaxed. The noise level was average. When I looked outside the window, I took in the downtown Boulder City streetlife. When I looked to the right I was looking at a small room of tables of red and white tablecloths that reminded me of a charming restaurant in a quaint village. And when I looked straight, I saw the counter stools. My prescription glasses were unnecessary to take in everything when the restaurant is small. This is the exact room that customers have been dining in since 1931.    If your on the road to having breakfast in a charming Boulder City restaurant, when you reach the traffic light where US 93 forks off from Nevada Way, keep straight on Nevada Way into the downtown business district. After Frank Rowe Park and Ash Street it will be on the left. The fact that Mel's Diner has been around since 1931 is testimony that they are doing something right."}
{"text":"The other reviews are right, if you head to the Hoover Dam, stop here on the way back! If you feel like having breakfast, get the haystacks! A biscuit, two eggs, two sausage patties and hashbrowns stacked together and smothered in sausage gravy. The sausage gravy is amazing! So velvety, so flavorful, it could make a shoe edible! The prices are awesome and once you're done you can walk around all the antique shops on the street to work off all the food you ate!"}
{"text":"These are the hash browns that elicit paragraphs of purple prose on the art of the perfect hash brown: crispy outside, creamy inside.  The bacon is pretty damn good, too,  It's important to remember that Mel's is not a loving, Disneyfied, hipster recreation of a vintage dive diner. It is an actual dive diner, divey continuously for however many decades, originated in the era when Phoenix was the spot on the highway where your radiator blew.   As a genuine dive. It's quite magnificent. Service is quick and unpretentious, food is good, prices are low, and you can have gravy on your biscuits and salsa on your eggs."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and great service.  This is fun little piece of history related to the show Alice.  We came on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy.  Our food came quickly and the portions were nice sized.  I had plenty to take home.  I had the chicken friend steak and it was delicious.  The pancakes were wonderful as well.  Definitely worth a follow up visit in the future."}
{"text":"We like this place very much.  The food has always been great and we usually sit outside with our dog.  For the most part, the people are friendly and the service has always been nice.  Lately however, whenever we sit outside, it seems like the wait staff take an extra long time to pay attention to the people sitting outside.  I waited a long time for silverware and when we asked the waitress for the usual supplies, like napkins, ketchup, salt, pepper, etc, she brought each item out one at a time. Not sure if she was new or what.  Either way we always come here cause it's a mom and pop joint."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert at breakfast cafes, but from what I would want and need, this is it. Ultra friendly service, fabulously delicious food, eggs cooked in all ways, pancakes, french toast, and all else you'd desire before lunch or after waking up late."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't go for the food because I wasn't even hungry. I happened to be in the nether regions and dropped in to take a gander at the historic spot.  Well, Mel's may be old but it's still sexy - so fresh and so clean-clean in the dining area and the character really shines through. I felt as if I had walked into a vintage single wide trailer-esque model with an additional wing built on. Classy.  Diners are last (and least) on my list when it comes to meals so I wasn't expecting much. But for what I got - I'm impressed. Just ten $1 federal reserve notes got me two fluffy pancakes, omelette, and home fries.   Definitely a belly full, if you like beginning your morning this way.  Next time, though, I'll go straight for the home fries. Yum! With salsa...Home run!"}
{"text":"Lake Mojave omelette was out of this world! Fresh wheat toast (not frozen bread) and hash browns tasted like fresh cut, seasoned potatoes (not frozen taters). Best diner food I've ever had. Seriously - had to commend owners Greg and Martha. Congrats!!  And total bill was only $20 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Good food, quality service and the owner is always very friendly. The coffee isn't the greatest, but then again, most aren't here for the coffee. The portions are very generous - the haystack is the thing to order if you're starving!"}
{"text":"Best Food Ever!!! I love this place I've been going here for a long time.  Every time is perfect. I highly recommend. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Is that one place down the street packed and don't want to wait?  Head to Mel's Diner.   I've been looking for a place like this near where I live and boulder city is super close.  Takes less time to drive there from Henderson than to drive across town.  Great hole-in-the-wall diner.  Good service, good food, and full cup of coffee.  Also, good gravy. :)"}
{"text":"Always a really good solid meal in a very friendly place. With great prices and even better staff and ownership family friendly a great place to be if your a arizonan or a visitor"}
{"text":"I like going here when I can.  They're closed on Wednesdays, but that's alright.  They're open mostly in the morning and close early afternoon.  I typically get the Patty Melt or my recent favorite is the French Onion Soup.  It's a good place for well made food and some homey sort of feel.  Always have an awesome experience when I go here."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the place from the opening credits of the sitcom \"Alice\" from the 70's.  Located near downtown and roughly 15 minutes from the airport, it's in a seedy part of Phoenix and surrounded by industrial type buildings.  Open only for breakfast or lunch, in this area, you could do much worse.  Food is diner food with plenty of calories and grease to go around.  Stick to the basics (not that the menu get's complicated or anything).  Eggs Bacon Hash Browns etc...  A cheeseburger at lunch.  Not exceptionally clean.  Use the bathroom somewhere else before arriving."}
{"text":"On our way to Hoover Dam, we used Yelp to find a breakfast place. There's a lot of Mel's fans out there so we decided to give it a try. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was packed with fluffy scrambled eggs, ham and cheese and it was simple but quite good.  It was advertised to come with homemade Serrano salsa, however I am 99% sure it was Pace picante sauce. Looked and tasted exactly like it, I would've preferred a delicious homemade salsa.  Oh well...still pretty good!  My boyfriend ordered an omelet (can't remember which). He loved it...the light fluffy eggs! I'm not quite sure what they do to make them so good! He also quite enjoyed the golden hash browns with onions cooked in them.     Staff was friendly, prices totally affordable, decor was basic, kind of small and tight inside so don't go for the interior just go for a simple yummy breakfast."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience here! Warmly and enthusiastically greeted immediately upon stepping foot inside the door by the friendliest waitress, Kristina! Excellent Service accompanied by beautifully prepared food. My husband's Double Decker Cheeseburger was ridiculously huge, perfectly cooked 100% REAL, (NOT mystery-) meat and just slightly melting cheese. Generous portion of perfectly crispy fries, and all fresh, trimmings. My ham & cheese omelet could have contained more than just a \"sprinkling\" of cheese, (hardly knew it was there!) but more than enough ham made up for it! The \"skin-on\" home fried potatoes, were absolute perfection! Kristina checked on us and our satisfaction an appropriate amount of times, and kept the refills of soda coming as fast as we could drink them! Table was kept tidy and clean as dishes were \"whisked-away\" as soon as we finished, for our comfort and relaxation after a great meal! I Love the place! It was immaculately clean, with charming, delightful accents throughout, and a very fair, reasonably-priced, more than enough \"choices\" menu, along with very nice people working here! Makes for a great restaurant to me?!"}
{"text":"What a little nice small downtown I ran into while going to Hoover Dam my very first time.  Was a bit hungry on the way and decided to check this place out since I was craving breakfast on the way.    This place really made you feel as if you were in the country side eating at a nice local family ran breakfast spot in a small town.  This was just a great escape away from living in Vegas.  The menu is pretty basic with your common breakfast meals (omelettes, steak and eggs, etc).  I ordered chicken fried steak and it was excellent. I always get mine drenched in gravy wherever I go.  Service was fantastic and made you really feel welcomed as if you were a regular. The wait for the food wasn't long but I heard it can get pretty busy during the weekends.  I did feel really young though because the majority of the customers were seniors but what else should I expect on a Monday morning.  I definitely would come back here again without second thought.  And oh they have a cute little restroom, haha just a thought I wanted to share."}
{"text":"This is just your basic diner, there is nothing special about it that I could detect, so don't be talked into the idea that this place is unique or otherwise worth going out of the way for.  It gave me everything I would have expected from a good diner; fast, friendly service, good food, and reasonable prices.  My breakfast meal, chicken fried steak with eggs and hashbrowns defined the term solid if unspectacular.  If you are on the way by or through Boulder City, and are ready to eat, by all means, put this place on your list.  Just don't get the idea that it is anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"The Original Mel's Diner from the Show Alice.Been here & still standing ever since.You will see the cast all over the walls.It is just like it was When the cast was there. There is a cook still working there that worked the show..  Specials & the Flo's grits the best.You could feel their presence."}
{"text":"I generally am not one to be negitive or to give a bad reveiw but all I can say is the place was in confusion and my sandwich had been setting on the shelf about 15 minutes -- once I got it, it was cold.  The waitress's had no clue about who was who's food.  Very frustrating  because I could see my sandwich waiting to be goiven to me...and once someone realized it was there, they had no clue who ordered it. Whatever you do....don't go to this place, it was horrible.."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents over the weekend.  The staff was super friendly, but the restaurant was more busy than usual, which made everything much slower.    I had the chicken fried steak breakfast.  The meat was tasty and the gravy was good.  My parents got soup with their lunches.  The soup was lukewarm, which was a bit scary to me.  My parents have been coming here for a while.  Overall, it is decent.  I would probably give it another try if they wanted to go again."}
{"text":"Typical diner food price is really good 2 for breakfast under $20.00. The eggs were supposed to be scrambled but were too runny to eat. The bacon was good the biscuits and gravy was good. Love the fact that you could have a biscuit as your bread choice and add a side of gravy for $0.99. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Forget everything else you've heard and take it from an ex-linemen, this is a great breakfast joint. Can't comment on anything else, but my omelet was one of the best I ever had. Wonderful hash browns and biscuits with gravy. Good coffee. Service maybe a touch slow as Christina was a solo act, but worth any wait. Dirty? No, but this is an old diner so the ceiling are not pristine. Everything about our food was absolutely clean.  So this is a blue collar joint that serves a wonderful breakfast. Next I'm in the area I'll be back."}
{"text":"Drove to Boulder City to go to Mel's - 2 friends from Henderson recommended it. I ate the Lake Mojave omelet, with cheese, mushroom, sausage and green chilies. Side of toast, side of hash browns. Hot, good, not too expensive.  I'd go again!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate lunch at Mel's today and it was a very pleasant experience! First of all, diners are a dying breed and this one has such a cozy feel that I almost fear that this one will fall victim to the chain restaurant. But, I hope not because I look forward to going back soon! Mel's is a Phoenix landmark, filming location of the television series Alice in the 70's and 80's. I'm positive that nearly all the decor is original and I find that very charming. The food was fast and hit the spot! It helped that Queen sang background vocals  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. And the bathroom was nice and clean. My ONLY issue was that the fork on my table was a little dirty. But, since I didn't use mine and my daughter didn't use hers, I didn't complain but only made mention of it to the gal that took care of my bill. I'll be in again, Mel's, thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice liitle diner which seems to be frozen in time. It was just the place my wife and i were looking for while enroute to the grand canyon. All of the people were very friendly,seated very quickly considering it only had 8 tables and some small counter space. I had the grilled chicken sandwhich and fries. The bun was very soft and delicious and chicken moist and tender. The mayonaise was not what i am used to so i cant bash it. My wife had biscuits with sausage gravy... Now thats diner food for ya. I found myself trading bite for bite with her."}
{"text":"We had friends in town and were taking them to Boulder City and were going to stop at THE OTHER diner that has been mentioned on a tv show.  I am so thankful that diner closed at 2pm since I would have not made it to Mel's Diner.  I did remember that Mel's Diner had good reviews so we went.  There were four adults and one child.  This diner is a small diner with a counter for people to eat at as well as tables and chairs.  The waitress was came over to our table as soon as we sat to take our drink orders.  We ordered from the menu and we were very impressed with the taste and the serving size.  I ordered the club sandwich, husband and friend ordered the philly and side salad (which was not side at all on big plate) and my other friend ordered the hamburger and my daughter ordered the hotdog.  The only issue I had just because I am dealing with a 7 year old the hotdog was a big, long dog which was cut down the middle and grilled.  My daughter didn't want to eat it at first since to her it didn't look like a dog.  After begging her to taste it as we did and it was really good, she loved it.  Then the owner came by and chit chatted with us.  I love small diners and love the small town feel vibe we got.  Everyone needs to come here if you are looking for this type of home town feel.  I will be back again and will bring out of town guests too."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Phoenix area for a long time. Never been to Mel's Diner. I'm old enough to have an awareness of \"Alice,\" the television show that gives the spot its ongoing notoriety, but I've never actually watched the show. Well, \"kiss my grits,\" as a character on the show used to say, Mel's is worth a visit.  Located in an industrial area near where I-10 and I-17 connect, Mel's is inconvenient for nearly everyone in the Valley. Consider it an adventure. Binge watch a little Alice before going and then be on your way. As you approach, you'll see a well worn sign with remnants of the neon that illuminated it back in the day. The interior is nicer than the exterior would imply, full of reminders of the history of the diner. Coffee mugs line the walls of the entire dining room. And yes, there is a lunch counter.  The staff is friendly. The food? Not great on this day. Pancakes were far from light and fluffy and and we had a problem getting our bacon out of the kitchen. Slow refilling coffee. None of it really mattered though. We were on a breakfast adventure. While we probably won't make Mel's a regular breakfast spot, we will definitely add it to the list of places to bring out of town visitors.   Mel's Diner is all about Alice, not the cuisine, but the Arizona skillet was good. Salsa was hot and spicy, a good thing."}
{"text":"Mel's Diner is good all-American cooking.  Good quality food and pretty basic things like hot dogs, burgers, turkey sandwich, etc. Service was friendly but a bit slow at peak lunch hour."}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I have been going here just about every week for a weekend breakfast for a few years now. Their scrambled eggs are better than I could ever hope to make. All the girls are fantastic - friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"So those of us from a certain age will probably enjoy the nostalgia this place brings to mind due to a certain 70s sitcom.  Equally for others of a certain age it may be nostalgic because it is pretty much the epitome of diners.   I was in Phoenix visiting a friend we decided to give Mel's a try.  We showed up for a late breakfast.  I can't remember the exact name of what I got but basically it was a southwest style omelet topped with ground taco meat with a side of hash browns and toast.  The portions were definitely generous and the food was delicious.  Funnily enough, I can't recall if they had grits on the menu...hmm.  Our service was great, I'm pleased to say.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Definitely no complaints there.  The atmosphere was casual and sitting at one of the booths, you could easily carry on a private conversation.  I'd definitely go back and try something different based on this visit.  Although that omelet was so good I'd be tempted to order it again and maybe a side of grits if available..."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast after a quick hike at Lake Mead and were tickled to death by the food and the service.  It's a small joint, but the entire staff was friendly and smiling-- we sat near the register and we didn't hear ANY employees griping or whining.  We'll definitely be back.  The only drawback is that they don't seem to have seating for larger parties.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and eggs-- I have never seen that man polish of food so quickly! My omelet was delicious, too!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive to Boulder City!!!!  First of all - this place is called \"Mel's Diner.\"  That is a great start!!  It is a tiny little restaurant with a counter and some tables.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  They place was full but we were seated very fast.  Great service - very friendly.  I ordered chicken fried steak with basted eggs, hashbrowns, sourdough toast.  The Steak was so gooooooood - smothered in gravy.   I could easily cut the steak with a fork.  Eggs were perfectly basted - plenty of coffee refills.  Affordable prices too.    This is a nice little Sunday morning drive and breakfast...   Perfect small town breakfast place.  Seriously - you will love this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been in-out-around-about Phoenix-Tempe-Scottsdale for more than twenty years, let alone the fact that Mel's has been here all this time and I only just learned of it via a friend who takes photos of vintage signs.   \"There's a new girl in town...and she's feel in' gooood!\"   The premise of the 1976-1985 tv sitcom \"Alice\" (played by Linda Lavin) is that she's on her cross-country way to L.A. but her car breaks down in Phoenix. She gets a job at \"Mel's Diner\"...\"and if things work out, she's gonna staaaay aaaawhile. bum bum bum bum baaaaa.\" Intro theme song: http://bit.ly/1uSfKb3 (just in case you want it to get stuck in your head too.)  The diner inside is not as seen in the show, but the sign is still there and there's local history behind it. There are framed newspaper clippings and the menu acknowledges the show's three waitresses: Alice, Vera, Flo and the owner: Mel.   Besides the history, you've got present day diner goodness. Fresh coffee, omelets, eggs, pancakes, biscuits and gravy and did you try the grits!? Unlike the show's Flo, there was no loudmouthed, beehived-redhead shouting out those three words at us but I still had a flashback:      In the '80s, iron-on t-shirts/jerseys were all the rage.  My mother wouldn't let me get Flo's  \"KISS MY GRITS.\" Do I digress? I don't!  Regress, maybe. A reason this place speaks '50s diner is that it has those \"space age\" tabletops that were popular in kitchens during that era. I sat at a kitchen table like that, wearing my second choice \"I was the kind of kid your parents didn't want you to hang out with\" iron-on jersey and scarfing down my food like all good kids who had to \"hurry up and eat so you can go watch tv!\"   Now, at a retro-tabletop window-seat booth in Phoenix, all of my little worlds collide when I come to Mel's. Side note and further collision: we'd seen Linda Lavin perform at Chicago's Goodman theatre awhile back with a truly all-star cast: http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/0405/finishing-the-picture/  Enough of memory lane! (Though if you feel like continuing, note that \"Mel's Diner\" is located just shy to the west of Phoenix's historic F.Q. Story Neighborhood District.) Ding!  What about counter seating? It's always been full at the counter when we've arrived, but I do intend to hop up there and watch the food come hot off the line. I may have to bring my own little bell though. I don't remember a bell at modern-Mel's. (Now, I'm digressing.)   Ding!   Dingbat! Birdbrain! Oh wow, I'm remembering more...that's what Mel used to call Vera. Bum bum bum bum baaaaa."}
{"text":"I had intended to come here in the 70s when the sitcom was popular, but never made it. I had forgotten about this little gem until I Yelped restaurants in this area of town. The iconic sign brings back memories of \"Alice\". I stepped back in time as I walked through the door. The walls are adorned with autographed photos of the stars that made this place famous. The diner is showing its age. Some of the linoleum tile is lifting and the restrooms are out dated. The wait staff is friendly. I ordered biscuits and gravy, sausage patties, and scrambled eggs. The breakfast was average the service was good. Except for the nostalgia of eating here, there's nothing special. I would try the all you can eat fish fry on Wednesday or Friday if I happen to be in the area again, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Everything you expect and want in a neighborhood eatery.  Fantastic food, great service and authentic surroundings.  Can get busy on the weekends, but the smiles are still in place and the food doesn't take much longer to arrive on your table."}
{"text":"there food is the best so good stopped by while my husband & i were on our way to hoover dam had a philly cheese steak sandwich very good there fries are the best wish they stood open later though. oh yeah customer service is very nice all the laddies are sweet hearts."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, friendly staff!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped there on the way back from Hoover Dam with the family.  Took a little longer than expected to get seating for 5.  Overall, the food was pretty good.  They needed to send back my eggs to be cooked a bit more.  The chicken fried steak was tender, but a bit too much gravy.  The owner is selling the place, so I'm not so sure they're able to keep good help.  Still a solid 4 out of 5.  Very nice waitress (I think the owner's daughter)."}
{"text":"Mel's Diner.   i had to give it a try, a schoolmate once told me it was a good breakfast, and a teacher concurred. i never went. but for some reason i wanted to go. so myself and 2 friends gave it a shot.  i was quite shocked by what i saw, and i told my friends, who are now getting sketched out by the place, \"remember, i heard it was good.\"  i didn't read a yelper's review of this place so i wasn't aware of the umm decor. holy crap what a sewer of a diner. the carpeting as described by others is horrid. i compare it to what you might expect of a homeless shelter. or at least a squatter house.  the attire of the waitresses was right on target with another yelper review. i couldn't imagine we went at the same day. so i guess it's the norm. think skanky truck stop hooker. and no not the child prostitute hookers. she was a lovely waitress, not nearly as bad as others have described. she was fairly cheerful and very helpful. i did not see the surly busser. but a sweet Hispanic lady was pouring coffee..i couldn't understand her, but only because she spoke very softly. love the misc. coffee mugs of random design.   i ordered an omelet with sausage, i asked what kind of sausage comes in it, and she asked what kind would i like. :D WOW. a choice? i chose patty sausage because i cannot stand sausage links chopped up into an omelet. i just hate it. this was great. i was entirely pleased with the omelet. i also got hash-browns and sourdough toast.  hash browns needed seasoning, just like all potatoes. i quickly aided my hash browns with the remedy. salt. toast was covered with margarine. eh. not a fan of that. but it was fine with grape jelly. :)  my two friends ordered 1 egg with bacon. the kicker and you would think this would annoy a waitress. one friend ordered food 15 minutes after my other friend and i ordered. we even already had the bill. lol. she took the bill and made the corrections without anything that was even remotely ill temper. not quite as described by other yelpers.  i give this place the 4 stars because the food is actually really good. and i enjoy the scum of the earth shit-hole restaurants. ONLY if the food is good. and to be honest. my omelet was better then any omelet i got at the Biltmore or the Princess. it wasn't super oily and it was simple and well executed. i will definitely be returning. maybe after a tetanus shot so I'm inoculated against fly :)  cost was cheap cheap. 3 people with moderate breakfast orders. under 20 bucks."}
