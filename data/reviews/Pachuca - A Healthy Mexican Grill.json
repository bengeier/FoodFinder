{"text":"Not good at all.  This place advertises itself as healthy Mexican food and I've been meaning to stop in for awhile.  They serve at a counter, where you pick your entree.  I decided to go for the 2 taco combo on soft corn tortillas, one with shredded beef and the other steak.  He threw the tortillas on a grill, which I presumed would make them hot, but they were not.  Scooped the beef in sauce out of a bin on one tortilla and pulled steak pieces out of another.  I also had a scoop of Mexican rice and I chose the black beans.  The only thing served hot were the beans.  The next person behind the counter topped the meat with toppings of my choice - pico de gallo, corn, cilantro - and gave me a cup for my drink.

They have a separate area with toppings, corn, salsa, hot sauce, mild sauce, jalapenos and olives.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce and the hot sauce was barely hot.

I went to my table, picked up the shredded beef taco and the tortilla broke apart in pieces.  They really should double the tortillas for tacos.  The beef was lukewarm, the toppings cold and wasn't very flavorful.  The steak on the other taco was cold, dried out and very tough, I couldn't even pull it apart with my hands.  I took the steak out and just ate the tortilla with the rice, beans, corn and pico de gallo.  

They were pretty busy here and maybe I ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't think I'll be back to try something else.  The food just was not good or fresh.

About $8 for the 2 taco combo plus a medium drink."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The staff was unfriendly, the whole experience was awkward and the food WAS TERRIBLE. Both mine and my friend's....There was one girl there at lunch time.All the food was cold and was NOT FRESH at all. Plus it was WAY too expensive for what you got. Can't say terrible enough! I feel nausea coming on just thinking about it. Sorry Pachuca...I know business is tough and bad reviews suck but you need to step it up big time. The place is pretty inside and COULD be awesome."}
{"text":"This Mexican Grill is apparently owned and managed by the folks at the nearby Bellagio's Mediterranean restaurant.   Bellagio's is great, but this Mexican offshoot needs a re-work in order to be successful.

The concept is very much like Chipotle's...walk up to the grill, place your order, they cook it, you pay at the end of the line and seat yourself.  Unfortunately, the menu is too extensive and the food is not very fresh.  They bill themselves as a Mexican Grill, but there are several Asian items on the menu.  So which is it?    

I ordered a chicken burrito/chicken taco combo platter, expecting fresh-grilled chicken.  What I got was chopped up chicken fished out of some sort of liquid on a steam table, then put on the grill for a few seconds, then put on grilled re-heated tortillas.  Afterwards, they asked me what extras I wanted, which ranged from pico de gallo, salsa, cheese, rice, etc.  By the time I got to my table, the tortillas were too soggy to hold their contents (see liquid chicken above), so I was left to eat the thing with a knife and fork.  Both items were bland and unremarkable.  My combo also included choice of beans and rice, and I got black beans with Mexican rice.  Those were bland, too.
 
There was a salsa bar, but none of the choices looked particularly fresh or appetizing.  I tried some of the red salsa to spice up my meal, but it didn't help at all. 

We ordered a glass of wine and a beer with our meals, but they didn't have what we wanted, so the cashier put in a call to Bellagio's, and 5 minutes later, one of Bellagio's waitresses brought over a bottle of wine and a bottle of beer.  If the items are on the menu, shouldn't they be stocked in the restaurant?  The drinks were fine, but it seemed odd that they had to be brought in from a restaurant two doors down.

I'm willing to give Pachuca another try.  Maybe it was just an off-night.  Maybe they're still trying to figure out their identity...I think they've only been open for less than a year.

The menu needs to be re-worked to something SIMPLE, and the food needs to be fresher.  I'll blame it on growing pains...I'll give them another 3 months to see if it's any better.  I hope so."}
