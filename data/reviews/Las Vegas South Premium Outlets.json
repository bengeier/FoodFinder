{"text":"Update: The SDX goes straight here. Before you had to take the Deuce. Many stores but deals are so-so. Two food courts is a plus. Other than that, nothing special. Still a place to check out."}
{"text":"Nice location, great place to go shopping if you don't want to deal with the typical mall."}
{"text":"What better way to burn off the Christmas calories than to go walk around the Las Vegas Premium Outlets, look for bargains, and then ask your parents to bu them all for you. My family made it an affair to take advantage of the bargains we can get at all the outlets in this place. It is indoor so there's no need to worry about the freezing weather outside. Along with the crowd of people, you can pretty much walk around and visit each outlet with your two piece suit, speedo or nothing at all. LOL! Some of the outlets we visited were:

Ann Taylor
Dickies
Levi's
adidas
Nautica
Banana Republic
Perry Ellis
Izod
Quicksilver
Clark's Bostonian
Dr. Scholl's
Ecko (my personal favorite!)

There's plenty more outlets available but some of the outlets were kinda if-fy. In the end, each of us were joyfully carrying a bag or tow or three or four... you get the idea!, of all the things we things we got at a bargain price!!!"}
{"text":"This place is more of a regular retail mall with some factory/outlet store sprinkled throughout. Good deals at the factory/outlet stores for sure.  I like that it is an indoor mall. Don't have to worry about crazy hot (or cold or windy) Vegas weather. Food court is pretty basic, not that great. There is a Starbucks so that's nice."}
{"text":"The worst service from these attendants ever.  I guess if you don't have an education you need to work somewhere.  I would think that Aeropostale screens their people to at least hire people with an ounce of customer service skills.  Worst part is that the manager condones the behavior.  Worst attitudes, may as well be in a war zone then at least it would make a little sense."}
{"text":"What the heck is going on with all the construction! Can't even enter or exit through the middle entrance! gah.

This mall is pretty big with a lot of cool stores that I normally like to shop at. Unfortunately, not a lot of the stores have good sales going on. I find that Premium Outlets by downtown has a lot better deals. 

They seriously need to update their directory too! I swear, my mom and I walked up and down the mall at least twice looking for a chef''s outlet, and we just figured they have closed down since a lot of the units looked closed. Parking is horrendous. And the mall is usually packed even at 10am. You are constantly weaving and dodging your way through people and kiosk sales people.

Ugh, and there are kiosks everywhere. And they all want to bug you and sample their product of you. I've learned to not make eye contact and to ignore them when they talk to you. 

I probably will go back just because it is close by to where I live, but I was ready to do some shopping today, and didn't find ANYTHING at all. I was very disappointed to say the least.."}
{"text":"I walked into the store ,no one said hello. As I was looking for some sneakers I couldn't find what I wanted I had to ask someone for help they were very unfriendly no custermer service at all will not go back!,"}
{"text":"I like this outlet there's a lot of food places in the same parking lot as the outlets, it's located on las Vegas Blvd between blue diamond and warm springs, the Nike out let is my favorite place to visit here I always tend to find good deals on shoes here. My daughter loves finding shoes here too. It's a fairly decent size outlet with tons of stores to choose from ."}
{"text":"Go to gap. Great prices and such cute clothes!  My toddlers entire wardrobe is gap head to toe. They always have really good sales and I've still got hoodies from when he was younger that have been washed numerous times and still look so good"}
{"text":"The south is the same as the north but inside and air conditioned.  If your here to really shop bring a suitcase. Actually buy the suitcase here. They're cheap too. Great brands at big savings. Spent a day here. Filled a suitcase. Enough said. Only reason not 5 because everything is not quite as cheap as people are saying. Remember tax goes on top in the U.S."}
{"text":"I found a couple of good stores here but the mall looks run down. Some stores look like warehouses. Food court is okay. They should do some renovation, other than that it's not bad. Also a lot of tourists."}
{"text":"Das Premium Outlet Center South liegt etwa in der Höhe des Flughafens und bietet wie mehrere Vorredner bereits angemerkt haben nicht so sehr PREMIUM aber doch relativ viel Auswahl und viel preiswertes für diejenigen, die nicht immer nur bei GUCCI oder bei BRIONI einkaufen. Ich habe letztens meinem alten Vater im Hat Shop für 100 bucks einen schönen braunen Stetson erstanden, den er jetzt mit viel Freude und großem Stolz trägt."}
{"text":"This is such a perfect model for high-end shopping, great little craft shops, and for the Vegas newbies who wants to find something fabulous to where I highly recommend this for anybody coming to the northside. And the cheesecake factory is absolutely super great service at the bar!!!"}
{"text":"Got some pretty good deals but you have to hunt for them!
NOT all stores are outlet or factory stores other than that is was clean cool and well maintained. Great variety of stores and places to have lunch.
Will return"}
{"text":"SO after an annoying time at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets (see other reviews) we decided we would try this outlet mall. 

Well this place wasn't much better. The Kiosk's here are just as annoying...we had some crazy dried fruit stand lady actually yell..yes YELL at us after we declined her free sample of coconut. She asked if we wanted to try some, I said \"no thank you\" and she literately snarled \"well have a SUPER DAY!!\" in an extremely snide and rude tone..to add to the fact that she YELLED it at us. 

Don't shop here if you like personal space because the Kiosk people here do not understand this concept."}
{"text":"Certain people that usually shop there is looking for discounts on things that they need.  I'm one of those. Anyways, I've just leaving there and as I was getting in my car, a homeless person was trying to open my door.  I started my car and was about to back out, that homeless person was standing my way.  I've asked to move or become a pancake.  It was going on for 20 mins and security was helpful and detained the homeless person.  Not recommended if your shopping alone."}
{"text":"Na, ich weiß nicht  dieses Outlet wirkt so gar nicht Premim und kann mit allen anderen amerikanischen Shopping-Paradiesen nicht mithalten.
Es erinnert mich an die Great Mall nahe San Francisco. Auch hier ist das gesamte Center überdacht und daher  Pluspunkt in Las Vegas  etwa auf Biofresh-Temperatur gekühlt.
Aber irgenwie ist alles chaotisch, auch gibt es viele un-Marken  alles in allem würde ich klar abraten und die anderen Malls und Outlets in Las Vegas empfehlen!"}
{"text":"Went shopping last day of trip. Decided to stop by the food court to eat not kidding was extremely gross floor was dirty all available tables were dirty. Went to mall office and blasted the operations director on the grossest food court I have ever seen.  Quite shameful. 

Dec 28,2016. Had a call from Victoria from the Mall managers office asking about what had happened that day. She also spoke about how she was going to rectify the issue and apologized. Victoria was very professional and courteous I look forward to shopping at the mall next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I came here when it was Belz, but I see it's been all made-over like? Oh. Well.... Fine. Have it your way then, Belz. 

This place is (was?) ok, deals are to be had. It's not like one of those malls where you're like \"uhh, isn't this meant to be an outlet? where the deals at?\", it's legit deal-filled.

However I do think Belz is a more memorable name. So I'm going to call it Belz."}
{"text":"Der Zusatz premium im Namen ist sicherlich nicht angebracht. Die Premium Marken sucht man hier vergebens, hier sollte man sich besser an die Malls im Stadtzentrum halten. Wer die normalen Brands sucht wird hier aber fuendig. Trotz der endlich durchgefuehrten Renovierung ist der Gesamteindruck dennoch nicht Premium. Lange Schlangen beim bezahlen und Kleinhaendler auf den Gaengen die einem permanent etwas aufschwaetzen wollen. Wenn man preisguenstig einkaufen will ist es aber einen Besuch wert. Auf die guenstigen Outletpreise gibt es meiszens noch 30, 50 oder gar 70% Rabatt."}
{"text":"Always fresh because they are so busy that's the key always going to bizzies food court in town that is the key to getting the freshest food"}
{"text":"Great prices and quality stuff. I got new work clothes and the always under rated underwear and socks. I got a great haul for about $350. Most of the pants I got were under $20 and the polo shirts the same. Next time I want to go to the high end stores. My friend got some great deals."}
{"text":"Clothing shoes, clothing & shoes everywhere you go, everywhere you look, more clothing and shoes. If you are in the market for clothing and shoes this is a spot. You will have so much to chose from in this vast location you will see be seeing double. Not only are there multiples of stores if you are paying attention you will see the same merchandise in different places throughout. If you have a day and the patientence of Mother Theresa you might be able to score the exact thing that you really wanted at another store."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Vegas, I always come to this outlet. There's always something reasonable to spend your money for. I like going here than gambling, whether you spent your money here or not, you are still a sure winner."}
{"text":"This outlet SUCKS.  The only store worth visiting is the Nike Outlet.  That's it.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The kiosk vendors are rude and aggressive,  so much so that I left after the 7th sales person said \"here's a sample for your sun spots\".  The 6th person said free sample for your wrinkles.  I probably need both but I'll leave the criticism to my dermatologist.  The majority of the shops sell athletic wear so if you are looking for ladies work clothes this isn't the best spot."}
{"text":"This outlet has improved from the last time I was there 2010. Great stores with good discounts. You can spend hours here."}
{"text":"Got some good bargains.  The mall feels a bit dark and dreary.  Needs an update."}
{"text":"This place has been remodeled and looks nice, especially from the outside. They have a huge selection of stores. Always a ton of tourists and tour buses. The one thing that really bothers me and prevents me from giving it a higher rating is all the kiosks in the middle of the narrow walkway. So many vendors bothering me to try a lotion or a steamer. I just want to shop and not be bothered. If you can get passed that and the crowds...it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Das Las Vegas Outlet Center wirkt auf mich immer etwas \"unaufgeräumt\", obwohl es das gar nicht ist.
Viele namenhafte Marken sind hier vertreten, aber auch viele mir nicht so bekannte Namen.
Es handelt sich hierbei um eine überdachte, also innenliegende Mall.


 Parkmöglichkeiten befinden sich auf dem großen Parkplatz vor der Mall im Freien (kein Parkhaus).


 Es wird z.Zt. dort umgebaut und etwas erweitert. Ab 17 März sollen dort noch \"Under Armour\", \"Guess Factory Store\", \"True Religion\", \"Toys\"R\"Us Outlet\", \"Subway\" sowie \"New Balance Factory Store\" neu hinzukommen. Ab April noch einige weitere Geschäfte.
Heute wurde noch kräftig gebaut und der halbe Parkplatz war gesperrt.


 Irgendwie gefällt mir die Premium Outlet Mall (http://www.qype.com/place/171849-Las-Vegas-Premium-Outlets-Las-Vegas) in Las Vegas Down Town viel besser."}
{"text":"Good prices and options or shopping. Of course if you're looking for stylish clothes this may not be the place but good for general shopping."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS MALL!  And I'm THRILLED to say that we shopped all over the mall on Black Friday without getting shot, pepper sprayed, arrested or otherwise injured :)  It's our tradition to Black Friday here & I LOVE IT!  There are some GREAT stores, GREAT service & some AWESOME deals to be had.  You do have to search 'em out, but TOTALLY worth it.  Some stores have better deals than others, which is why you have to search.  But I do LOVE Nike, Adidas, Bass shoes, Champion & LOTS more!  This place is DEFINITELY worth the visit.  Have FUN :)"}
{"text":"Right next to my hotel 
3 min walk from it. Couldn't be better.
Didn't bring rainy day clothing."}
{"text":"I love this outlet since the remodel. The stores are better and it is easy to access all of them from any spot in the parking lot. I usually shop here for my sons clothes and shoes which I can get for a great price at vans, gymboree, converse, or stride rite. It is a great place to shop whether you have time to stroll and shop or if you just need to run in and out."}
{"text":"Only been in Vegas a few months and LOVE this place! Prices are fantastic in most stores and my daughter loves the big merry go round in the court. 
Must shop here wether you're a tourist or local!"}
{"text":"June 3, 2013

Found my son Pumas that were originally $60 on sale for $30, so that was nice. 

Went to Disney store and found a Mickey trading pin for 3.99 heh heh heh, made me and my lanyard VERY happy!!!!!

Took the SDX bus from the strip here.  $14.00 per person for 24 hour ticket."}
{"text":"I'm starting to lose all interest in this location due to the dismal customer service I've received on a number of occasions. My most recent experience made me want to forbid all visiting guests from visiting this outlet. At check out, an employee of the Adidas store informed me that the item I wanted to purchase would be 50% off on President's Day. When I returned the following day, another visit solely to purchase the item, that particular employee was not present and the manager refused to honor his (mis)representation. Additionally, she appeared as flippant and unapologetic. I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"So after we left The Town Square, we came here to the Outlet. We walked around checking out different stores and kiosks... Needless to say, we walked from one end of the Outlet to the other end just because we had nothing else to do for the day. We ended up buying two little monkeys that are magnetic for the frides (for my newphews).. The oldest one keeps asking for the monkeys that can wrap around you.. one that we saw at the stores in the airports,....I got him a mini version, but will get him the big one as well. We got them from the souvenir spot. Then we bought these slimy balls that when we you throw then down on the counter, they splat then return to their original shapes. $4.99 plus tax for each one.. But there was a special... if you bought two, the third one was free. We also bought tshirts that had gangsta Mario from Super Mario Bros on them for Lil Man and the two of them. They were $14.99 for each shirt plus a extra $1 to have \"Las Vegas\" added. And of course I had Las Vegas added to all three shirts. The last thing that we bought was a model of a Chinook (Army plane). We chatted with the sales guy for quite some time. He was trying to convince my son and me why a little plane (not the Chinook)...one that could fit in your palm, was a bargain... Telling us that it normally runs $79.99 plus tax, yet he was willing to let us walk out of the outlet with a price of $40... YEAH RIGHT... Lil Man asked about the Chinook...And the guy gave his pitch about how it costs $139.99 plus tax, but was willing to give it to us at $80. Well well well, we walked out of the outlet with only paying $70 for it and called it a day so that we could go home and test out the new gadget that we bought. Both of us had fun last night playing with it. It is a remote controled Chinook. We had a fanatastic time hanging out and playing with it."}
{"text":"The prices her CAN NOT be beat! I take all my friends/family that are visiting because everything is such a good deal. They have a good variety of stores too. I like the way the outlet is set up because if you are there for a certain store, you can just park near it and parking is plentiful. I try not to go during summer time because it can be quite busy and some tourists GO HAMMMM and you might get trampled lol. Other than that, I really have no complaints."}
{"text":"Really great, fun place. The shops tend to be pricier than normal, more boutique like. Love it in the summer time when the splash pads are up and running. Love all of the activities they hold year round for the general public."}
{"text":"I've been living in Las Vegas two years now,and I can't believe I never visited the outlet mall before,I always go to north premium outlet because it's closer to where I live,but I love this location it's close and all my favorite store are close to one another and the best thing it's indoor,so no matter if it's hot or cold I can always get my shopping done!! I'm so excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"Everyone was kind and courteous. I had a good experience. I was happy with the merchandise I purchased."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. If I'm in need of something on a moment's notice, I'll stop in. Otherwise, I will drive the extra 15 minutes to the North Premium Outlet mall, or over to Town Square. Three stars for convenience, two stars for store selection."}
{"text":"What a great shopping center! So many different stores! They also have a food court. We stopped here before we went to the airport and didn't realize how close and convenient it was!"}
{"text":"Typical mall with many stores but you must be a smart shopper and know a bargain when you see it.  Food courts seem dull, where is the Burger King, Mickey-D's, Taco Bell?  Hand sanitizer dispensers located at various locations throughout the mall but most are empty and have been for a week or more.  I guess dirty hands spice up the dull food.  Hours are great."}
{"text":"Pretty big outlet. I am happy with the selection of stores here. I walked into Charlotte Russe, Nike, Adidas, Sketchers, Dr. Scholls, another shoe store that I can't remember the name to, and a tux shop. Employees in these stores were nice especially the guy in the Dr. Scholls. He pointed me in the right direction for a particular shoe at a tux shop. Good amount of food selection as well. There is a carousel for the kids to ride."}
{"text":"Always a great place to look for sales on brand named clothing, shoes, household stuff, etc... Huge selection of stores to choose from!  It's also indoors. Some stores you don't find in the other Vegas outlets.  I would say they could have better food selections.  There's also a huge carousel for the kids! Although It's a little pricey if you ask me.  I believe it's $2 a ride! Right now there's quite a bit of construction goin' on & it seems like it may start looking like the other outlet, which is outdoors."}
{"text":"Still ben my favorite place to shopping in Las Vegas ... I LOVE IT .. 

Sigue siendo mi lugar favorito en Las Vegas para hacer mis compras.. ME ENCANTAAA"}
{"text":"For an outlet mall, stores are still pretty pricey. Parking is stupid, especially when trying to get to the food places near Las Vegas Blvd. I've worked in a couple of these stores before and they treat their employees terrible, which explains the bad customer service most of the stores offer. It's a pretty touristy place considering the amount of people you'll see hauling their suitcases around. Tiny walkways crowded with those annoying vendors trying to sell you some hot new toy your kid doesn't need or some magical anti wrinkle cream made from the mud of the Irish springs-- because every teenagers needs that, right? Overall not really my scene for shopping. 

I do, however, really enjoy their food kiosks. I'll never pass up a chance for Starbucks, Annie's pretzels, or Dunkin Doughnuts! For some reason, the food vendors seem like the only ones to hire a friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is an indoor mall with no frills... no fancy decorations that you find in modern new malls. Just rows of shops in an old drab building, but what they lack in eye candy, they make up for in deals. It's a little lower-end than the north outlets, but there are still some pretty good shops.. and best of all, it's fully indoors and has waaay better lunch spots (two food courts inside, and outside past the parking lot is stuff like (off the top of my head) Chipotle, McDonalds, Five Guys, Dennys, Chilis, etc. 

Pros:
-They do have higher end shops like Coach, Michael Kors, Bose, Ann Taylor, Swarovski, etc. But not as many as the North premium outlets.
-Lots of lunch options
-Fully indoors (North premium outlets is outdoors)

Cons:
-Not very impressive... the building is so drab and depressing.
-Very crowded! Full of tourists from everywhere.
-Parking is always crowded. Try and park at the back or towards the end of the building."}
{"text":"I love this outlet.  It is located on Las Vegas blvd and Warm Springs, near the airport.  It has a Lane Bryant Outlet store for us big girls.  They are missing a Torrid Outlet.  Loving the disneyland outlet on the outside in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this was the Belz Outlet Mall. Then it became the Outlet Center. Belz was cool, the Outlet Center was lame. 

Now, it's become the Premium Outlets of Las Vegas-South. Let me tell you, it is quite the impovement.

The outside looks almost the same as the original Premium Outlets. Now the way it looks inside is still rather....stale. They need to work on that. That said, they do have a much better selection of stores now, with the already existing stores being vastly improved. The Niketown here is far better than the one at the North outlets in my opinion. This is also the area with the highest concentration of Dunkin' Donuts locations in Vegas, with two inside the mall and one in the parking lot. :D (There really aren't enough locations of those here). I'm really upset they closed the music store (Music 4 Less) though, one of the best music stores ever. Then again, they brought down the carousel that used to be at the Meadows Mall, so I suppose that's an improvement. 

The biggest problem with this mall is still there however: The layout. It's essentially a 0.5 mile long strip of a building. The thing that sucks most about this is parking at one end, having to go to a specific store, looking at the map and then realizing it's all the way at the OTHER end. At least it's an air-conditioned building you have to walk through but still. Thankfully, an expansion is being planned, hopefully they'll change up the layout in the process of the expansion so walking from one end to the other won't take 30 minutes. 

So after years of being lame in every possible way it's finally worthwhile to shop in this mall again. I can't wait to see what other changes are in store for it."}
{"text":"Big improvement from when I came last year! Great stores, big sales. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here during the weekday early evening. Right when I got here, I headed straight for the customer service desk to get a free discount card (get additional discounts to majority of stores at this outlet, as long as you have a triple A card) and then went on my way to shop. 

What I like about this outlet is that it is indoors (with an exception of a few shops outside in the \"promenade\" area) so no matter what the weather is outside, you can come here to shop and save a lot of coins/ cash on whatever you buy. 

This outlet is pretty similar to the Las Vegas Premium Outlet North, but the South outlet has 10 stores less and the South is all outdoors. 

There is plenty of parking right out front.

Overall, great place to go shopping and very close by the strip."}
{"text":"I was at the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets today. Very disappointed to report that the Corningware Corele Revere store is gone."}
{"text":"First time at the LV outlets! There's two outlet one on the north side and one located in the south! Over the years I've hear that the south was always better and I would have to agree...after looking up what stores where located at each location! I love how it's an indoor outlet! Coming from CA most outlets are outdoors! This place is huge! They offer a lot of retail stores as well but I would have to say the walkways are narrow so if given on a busy day it would seem super crowded! They offer a lot of restaurants in the outlet as well as business on the outer area...the outlet is great place for food!"}
{"text":"Love, love this outlet!!  Every time I'm in Vegas, I'm there. It's never too super crowded. The selection of stores and restaurants is excellent. I never leave empty handed."}
{"text":"Super crowded after Christmas, small walkways and lots of people make for a clausterphobic mall. No like.  You can tell this place needs some SERIOUS remodeling. 

The only things that was good were the deals inside some stores.  BUT a lot was picked over. Next time we will go to the North ones."}
{"text":"This place is like my favorite aunt. She may not be the prettiest or richest and she may not even be the best cook, but she's always there for you and sure knows how to make you feel good.

When you show up to her house, make sure you arrive full, because you definitely don't want to eat her cooking. She may have two kitchens, but she doesn't know how to use them. But that's okay because she tries. 

She knows how to get you socks, underwear, and all your wardrobe essentials for cheap. She does have some unusual guests over that harass you while you explore her house (read: crazy kiosk people), but you have to take the good with the bad.

Every now and then she shows up with something really stylish and you wonder, \"where did she get that? I want one!\" (Usually at Van Heusen, Perry Ellis, or Calvin Klein. Just saying.)"}
{"text":"Got a sweet pair of Nike shoes at this outlet. I like this mall because it's indoors and the parking situation is easier. There are more food choices in the foodcourt and more restaurants outside the parking area.
The prices are a little more expensive than the North Outlet but they compliment each other well."}
{"text":"Love love that these stores are located inside with A/C. Such a huge plus when shopping with kids! Great variety of store selections, good discounts, always plenty of parking, food court for when you work up an appetite shopping. This one seems to be less crowded than the North ones too, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Although I prefer going to the Las Vegas North Premium Oulets, we come here from time to time especially during the warm weather.

The outlet is designed like an indoor mall with stores from end to end. You have several entrances throughout the outlet and a food court in the middle. There are also shops and restaurants surrounding the outlet. 

They have all of the typical outlet stores here like Nike, Adidas, Micheal Kors and other independent stores so you should be able to fulfill your shopping needs."}
{"text":"Nothing like going to an outlet only to hear my cousin say, \"I chose the wrong outlet!\" Yeupp. The Las Vegas Premium Outlets consist of a North AND a South side so you should check online to see which stores you want to go to in order to choose which outlet you would want. Or go to both. Whichever floats your boat. 

The parking lot for this outlet is HUGE which makes it easy to find a spot.. unless you come here for Black Friday shopping like I did in which case, it was hell.

There are shops inside and there are shops outside. Food court is located right in the middle with a variety of food options so you're sure to find something you like or you can go for Auntie Anne's pretzels that are located at one of the entrances of the mall. Bonus: there's a bathroom area near the food court.

There's not much I can say. I'm not really a shopper so I didn't really get much except a shirt for $10 at the Disney Store outlet. But you know, walk around. Take in the shops. The people. Enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Decent outlet mall.  The vendors in the middle aggressively trying to sell their items are a bit annoying.  If I want your crappy cell phone case I'll ask for it, otherwise get out of my face! lol  The north location is no different, just hotter since it's outside.  If I had to choose I would probably choose this one due to the air conditioning, but the north location is a little bit nicer with a few higher end stores."}
{"text":"The location is out dated, but the stores are very modern & actually provide a discount. For me, it was well worth it as all the shops I would go to are there like Quicksilver, Zumiez, Pac Sun, Volcom, Hurley, etc.

I could spend all day trying to find deals :) I think it's better then Primm & Barstow."}
{"text":"Things I would rather do than be in a strip mall:

--going to the dentist
--getting kicked in the stomach
--read \"FIfty Shades of Gray\" (and that's really bad)

Things that would lead me to flee to a strip mall:

--The Strip

Sorry, not a fan of windowless casinos with no signs that hint at time of day/decade or directions (when you're trying to cut through and get hopelessly lost). A Las Vegas conference took me to The Strip, and by day two I felt so smothered by the imitation cultures, I took a 15-minute bus ride to the outlets. Yes, an outlet felt more real to me than The Strip, which has all kinds of meta-irony.

I was also driven by a long denied necessity of buying a new pair of pants, because I had apparently packed on a paunch. Most of the stores were a bust for me, but the standouts were Kitchen Collections (be warned, prices are department store rate not outlet, but a good one-stop shop for gifts), Rack Room Shoes (flats that aren't orthopedic looking, buy one get the second half off), Banana Republic (found my black light-weight pants for $11, what?, as well as work and even night-appropriate pants for $35), and Guess (another lightweight pair of black pants, these linen for $25). The mall appears to be adding more stores

Minimal exciting options at the food court, but a thumbs up for the Dunkin Donuts booth: I ordered an iced coffee and just one munchkin (or whatever they call their donut hole), and the guy said, \"oh just give it to her, it's not worth charging.\" He probably noticed I was sucking in my paunch and felt sorry for me, but that was very sweet."}
{"text":"hmmmmm what can I say about this place. Oh, I know, I wish they had a golf cart to drive to all the great stores that they have in here!

Ok, yes, I don't really like shopping but the company I was with was soooooo into it. We went to every shop and looked and looked and he finally saw what he wanted, a pair of shoes. Ok that's fine but it took him over an hour!!!! I walked outside, he would text me to look at this one, I did. I walked out again and he texted me another, this time with a pic! I dragged myself in and I guess I was literally dragging myself in because the Security started laughing at me and said \"that bad huh\" I looked at him and smiled and laughed and said that I was trying. He told me \"it's usually the guy that looks the way you do\" I told I know right, but I really hate shopping

This time I tried staying in and helping him look for those right shoes  but all I did was walk back and forth. Fixed up some shoes people just left behind, so inconsiderate to put it back!! But he did it! He finally found one pair of shoes that he really liked!! I don't know if I did but I did do the whole speel(?) lol how does it fit? Is it right anywhere? Where is your big toe at? Is the sides right? Try and walk around with it? Bend down? Tippy toes like you're reaching for something?  Ok I said it and yes I'm adding this on, I even said \"try and fart\" LMAO  ok this was the hint that I wanted to go already. 

He said he was glad that I had helped him and I was so glad to be out of the BIG MALL where there are endless stores for shopping and nothing interested me. Thanks for a wonderful with great company who put up with me through it all!"}
{"text":"Great outlet mall. Pretty much every store you'd shop at with huge discounts. I went on Valentine's day...oh it was a blessing & a curse. Let me start of with the blessing, tons of additional saving due to holiday weekend. I went to the Coach store and they had 50% off WHOLE store. No exclusions! MK had lots of deals as well. 
As far as the curse. Ppl everywhere. We pulled in with about 4 tour buses following us in. It took us about 30 mins to find a parking spot after circling a few times. The Nike store was a madhouse. Ppl everywhere! Shoes all over the place. No big deals at Nike but addl savings on active wear. After all the shopping we headed to Cheesecake Factory which was a huge mistake because it was Valentines Day. It was about 3pm, we decided to put our names down. It wasnt that bad of a wait approx 25-30 mins. Our waiter was terrific and got us in and out cuz we had to get bk to our hotel for a show later that evening. When in Vegas its always a must to visit the outlet mall. Til next time! I gave 4 stars due to crazy parking situation"}
{"text":"The good thing about this mall is that its very close to the airport and the Car rental which is away from the airport is very close to this mall. Compared to North Outlets this mall has more known brands.

The mall is quite good interms of having many shops and you can find lot of brands. The mall is clean and has a decent food court. As we had check out we were chilling at this mall as rental car return was close by, so we also ate here. 

We tried 2 places \"Pita's\" and \"Rocky's Philly\". Customer service was great at both places and the owners were very friendly in taking order and telling us about the menu. The cooking and serving areas were quite clean. These places servers Halal meat, except 2 items all the other stuff is halal at both locations just confirm with the staff. They Guys/owner also helped us with showing us how to get to the car rental place. As for the food we ordered Chicken wrap and Philly's cheese steak both were really done nice and tasted quite good."}
{"text":"I'm going out on a limb on this one.  But, out of all the malls that we have in Vegas, this is my favorite one. In fact, I would say that this is one of the best \"mall\" I have ever been to in my entire life.

Many of you have been to a mall at some point in your life. What I hated most about going to the mall was the fact that everything is overpriced. LVPO-S is basically the same setup as a classic mall, but everything is discounted.  Another great thing about this place is that it has all the good brand name stuff that we go to at a mall for (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and food), and it does not have the \"filler stores\" (you know what i'm talking about, Shoe Palace, Cellairis, Fanzz etc.)

This time I went to the Skechers store to find some work shoes. Being an outlet store, these stores are somewhat bigger and carry a larger selection than their regular retail outlets. They had the size and model that I wanted that the retail store didn't carry, and they were about 33% cheaper, possibly more. I was satisfied.

A lot of people complain about going to outlet stores because it's not as \"new\" as the ones in their retail stores. Hey, it's your money and you can buy whatever you see fit for yourself. But for me, I'm not going to be hanging out with Paris Hilton on the weekends or rubbing elbows with the Bieber Fever. Besides, anything you buy new at a regular mall will be \"out of style\" within a few months. 

I usually shop on Amazon and ebay now, but if I needed to shop for something, and if my computer and cell phone were down, I would go here. Without a doubt. :D"}
{"text":"This is a terrible shopping outlet, not much designer stores, very limited.  The inly good thing here is indoor and air conditioned building."}
{"text":"There were a couple of people in my group that wanted to stop by this outlet because they haven't been to this one before. I decided to tag along and kill sometime in between breakfast and gambling and getting my drink on.

On the drive down Vegas blvd, I know we didn't pass through any wormhole or temporal anomaly... but pulling up to the outlet, I could swear the year was some time in the 1980s and some where in the Midwest. I checked the GPS on my phone and I still had signal so we were definitely in at least the 2000s and my GPS told me we were still in Vegas. 

We all get out of the car and the outside pretty much matches the inside. Everything is very old and dated and in some cases pretty sad looking. I am sure it could draw more people with a cheap face lift. The food area is pretty much the same as well. They had a fast food joint called \"Chicken Now\" which was f'in awesome and made me laugh for like 15 minutes. The place looked like it could be straight out of the movie Napoleon Dynamite like in a stand right next to the chicken farm where Napoleon gets a job. Simply awesome.

The deals are either average or cleverly disguised to make you think you are getting a deal. The only good thing about the place is if you want Vegas gifts to bring home to family/friends, they have a couple of stores here where you can get it cheaper than your hotel gift shop."}
{"text":"I love the variety of stores they have, my only complaint is they really don't have outlet prices unless there is a sale going on. I think this is a set up for tourist because i have went into the regular mall and some of the prices are the same. How can it be the same if one is a discount store. I think they need more variety in food at this outlet both food courts have similar foods you would think with 2 food courts there would be more options to pick from. The stores are always busy, but the nice thing is they keep the shelves stocked. I like this location better than the north location because it's indoors so on hot days you only have to go outside for a few stores but the majority it indoors."}
{"text":"Here are the PROs & CONs of LVPO-South:

PROS:
-Recent makeover helped to roll in a bunch of new outlets.
-Indoor mall with A/C... good for those over 100° days.
-AAA discount for members if you show your card at the concierge.
-FUN carousel for kids to enjoy.
-A decent place to shop for costume ideas or themed-party wear.

CONS:
-While a few outlets offer a good find or two... majority of them still suck.
-Random booths selling useless stuff AND rather quite annoying.
-The food court is abysmal. 

CONVENIENCE: *** [Located at the south end of the strip, easy find, ample parking.]
AMBIANCE: *** [Strangely designed layout, somewhat difficult to hit specific stores.]
SERVICE: *** [Is it me or do the employees seem like they don't enjoy working there.]
PRICE:  $$  [I've found some items under $5-10, tho most items not worth buying.]
OVERALL: *** [3-stars... Sure, I enjoyed the nice makeover of the mall, but honestly coming here is a waste of time.  Better just head to the outdoor LVPO-North.]

Nuff said.

{"text":"Everyone in this store was extremely helpful and kind. I had no idea what I wanted to buy they personally helped me find the perfect bag and wallet set for a great price! 
Thank you so much for your kindness!"}
{"text":"100x better than LVPO North.  Love the newer stores they opened outdoors.  I got tons of things on sale here.  Also, I can walk around outside without walking through one huge second hand smoke cloud.  Would most definitely return! :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst outlet mall that I have ever visited. The first problem was the distinct lack of air conditioning. Which, logically, resulted in an unpleasant odor throughout the mall. It is also extremely dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. 

It was simply an uncomfortable shopping experience and, although we walked the entire mall and looked in a lot of shops - trying to tackle the items on our list, the only store we purchased from was Hanes (socks and underwear). 

Do not even bother driving there and looking for parking. You are better off going to the outlet mall on Grand Central (which is open air) or Fashion Show (which is clean and has a number of wonderful stores).

Also, has anyone else noticed that the outlet malls do not have that many bargains? You can find the same price on Levi's and Vans at your local Kohl's."}
{"text":"thank you for las vegas premium outlets for upgrading this indoor mall!!! finally the renovations are done and shopping is very convenient now. they have added more stores and there is two foods courts for customers to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"What's up with the people who work @ this mall? Besides Renee @ New York and the dressing room attendant guy @ Ralph Lauren; everyone else was snobby, not helpful, not friendly. I understand that most people who shop here are tourists but some like me are locals and if treated well, will return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Lots of great stores. I brought friends from England here to shop and they had a great time buying stuff. It was on a Wednesday night so it wasn't very busy which was nice!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not a sucker for brand names...but I am so not impressed with this place. There are tons of middle of the aisle carts with vendors trying to entice you to buy things.
The only one I may have stopped for is the massage!
I went into the hat store looking for a few special hats, they had one i was looking for, and it seemed over priced, so i didn't buy it.
I also stopped in a kitchen supply store, and it was awesome, but this was the only store that was awesome. If you need anything kitchenesque, this is the place!
Other than that, I left shortly after arriving."}
{"text":"This mall is a little outdated. I'm not exactly sure how long it's been around, but my dad would take my brother and me here when we were kids to go back to school shopping. It must have said a lot about this mall because back then we had no car and had to bus it. It felt like half a world away.

So fast forward to present time. Coincidentally, I work here now and yet I still live half a world away. The mall has changed its name and its look. More shops have opened. As far as outlets go, you'll probably find a store you are looking for. If not, you can drive a couple of blocks down the street to Town Square.

The food options here kind of suck, but if you don't see anything you like, there is a plethora of restaurants to choose from in the same shopping complex. 

Because this is an outlet that is located close to the strip, a lot of people who come here are tourists. Some of the stores are understaffed and the customer service is nothing to rave about unless you go into a store like Coach or Michael Kors.

The parking lot is big, but can sometimes be a nightmare, especially during the holidays. This mall is an indoor mall, which can be a bit of a relief in the summer time. However, some stores are only accessible through the outside and do not connect with the inside of the mall. 

If it's not too hot out, I prefer the North Outlet."}
{"text":"I went to the north premium outlets yesterday and came to this one today. I personally think that the indoor one would be better for the winter. However, the selection here isn't as great as the one at the north premium outlets. There are less stores and less items in each of the stores. There are less people at this one compared to the other one. Even though It is smaller, It is still a great place to shop at and people are very friendly. Definitely worth stopping by if you're near!"}
{"text":"Good shopping with good pricing.  

With stores such as Michael Kors, True Religion, Coach and Bose, it's easy to find some cute finds that will fill the trunk. It's conveniently located on Las Vegas Blvd and the 215.  There are tons of tourists that shop here.  I am guilty of taking a cab here before I lived here while staying on the strip.  

The majority of the stores are inside with about a dozen with outside entrances.  There are also several restaurants that line the front of the outlet in front of the parking lot.  

Like I said before, there are tons of tourists as well as locals that shop here.  It's always pretty busy. For this local I'll shop here on occasion to put that smile on my face.  

Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"For tourists this place is fine and dandy, there's a good mixture of upscale and regular retail stores which caters to tourists. Lots souvenirs and merchandise emblazoned with the \"Las Vegas\" logo can be found here at discount prices. 

The facade of this outlet has undergone major renovation and looks great! Shopping outdoors along the Promenade area has been added. Under Armour, Fossil and Coach stores were relocated to larger retail space out here. There are benches and shaded areas where you can just sit out and chill. 

Im not fond of the long and narrow layout of this outlet's indoor area. It can get really packed in and harder to maneuver your way around. That and the long corridor is a pain. If you want to backtrack to another store that's at the other end, better learn how to dodge the kiosks selling snake oil. Some of those salespeople can be really annoying. 

For locals it's A-OK. Back in the day when shopping for back to school clothes for the kids it was cool. They have some good discounts to get you in the door.   Although now  I find most of the retail \"outlets\" selling in season merchandise at retail price so it's pretty much a waste of time if you are coming here to score a bargain. But if you're looking to refresh that favorite shirt that you got your husband one season ago or silverware or plates that have been discontinued,  you are bound to find it here. Then maybe it's worth your time. Other than that there's nothing really special or spectacular that would draw me to go shopping here any longer."}
{"text":"Yelp 365 challenge: Review 001/365 (8/1/2011)

What I've discovered today at LVPOS:

Rain in Vegas makes a ridiculous amount of people flock to South (instead of the more popular North).

Rain in Vegas makes my cell phone service act up, which in turn makes it a PITA to shop separately from my male friend (who checks out completely different stores than me).

Rain in Vegas makes an outlet shopping experience less than stellar - especially when I can't walk around at my own pace or even use my cell phone!"}
{"text":"Got some good deals at this outlet mall. Easier to park there than the North Outlets. I'd recommend checking it out for deals on designer label clothes and shoes."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and rest. Oh, and get some shopping done too."}
{"text":"We always stop here while in vegas to buy gifts for the kids and fam from our vacation.Nothing over the top or fancy here. There a ton of stores to choose from here as with most outlets.I do like the Puma store and it's frequent 50% off sale where I clean up ! Plenty of parking but terrible food choices inside so eat prior unless you love MSG."}
{"text":"This outlet was not what I thought it would be. It was dark inside. Also, the selection of stores was boring. Next time I'm going to the other Premium outlets in Vegas. They have more high end outlet stores in that location."}
{"text":"Ya, this place is older, but I found better deals here than the \"Premium\" outlet place downtown.  

This is located a few miles South of Mandalay Bay on LVB.  I boarded the deuce bus in front of Bellagio and rode it to the outlet center, then back again.

There's a decent selection of stores here, and the food court options aren't bad either.  The place was packed on the afternoon I visited.

I will certainly find my way back here again."}
{"text":"Not as fancy as the \"North\" outlet, but it's all inside.
There was an awesome store here 2 years ago where I bought fab shoes & purses, it was no longer there. This mall has lots of shoe stores, but I only found 1 pair of sandals. Not really any \"big\" anchor stores that would 'draw in the tourists' but it's relatively decent."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Puma and Vans!.....  What can I say Imma shoe freak!"}
{"text":"I hate going here. The lighting is terrible and the vendors try to stop you at every turn. 

There's a vans shoe store here. Great deals always empty.

As seen on TV store.

Discount Hot Topic
Didn't really seem that cheap

The kitchen itemy store is ok really cluttered. 

Some designers like Sean Jean 
Calvin Klein, I think I saw Armani exchange.

Not that cheap though :/ 

Skip this one and go downtown. 
You'll be pleased if you do."}
{"text":"I will agree with other posters that the mall is definitely laid out poorly. You end up missing a lot of shops because by the end, you just don't want to walk down all the side paths. It usually is crowded as well and you might as well just accept the fact that you will be parking at the rear of the parking lot and walking. 

Other than that, it's not too bad of a place. It does look a bit rundown, but there are a lot of shops inside. The Nike outlet is great and has great deals, as do a lot of the other stores such as Charlotte Ruse and Rack Room Shoes. 

If you can deal with crowds, I'd recommend checking this mall out."}
{"text":"This outlet lies way south of the strip and is easily accessible by bus if you don't have car.
As for the mall its in decay like many places in Vegas. I got a dimly lit old feel when I walked in.
Plenty of shops to go around but the prices aren't any better from the north branch outlet of this outlet.
Food court is just a ragtag of chain fast food food joints. Nothing special to try here.
If you are looking for outlet prices I would recommend driving all the way down to Primm Valley outlets."}
{"text":"Very nice updates on the stores but is this really an outlet mall or another shopping mall?  Because the prices aren't that low compared to regular malls.  Err?"}
{"text":"This shopping center is weird, at first we thought it was a store with random brands and then had to walk to another.  

Ha!  We surprised ourselves!!  This outlet was huge, with okay stores.  Man, i bought this pretty cream colored dress at Charlotte Russe and end up losing it somewhere.  It was all because of the stupid bullshit massage we got from those old china men!!!  Gave us even more pain to our backs and made me lost focus of everything else around me!!  Arghh,  i was so sad.. had to walk my ass all the way back to the areas i was at.  We already made it towards our exit, and thats when i realize something was missing.  Luckily my friend held on to my coach bag, i woulda been even worse!!  Aiyah.. what happens in vegas stays in vegas!!!  

omg, i so hate when people uses that phrase.. ugh.

i had a bad experience here, but i still got to exchange my coach wristlet for an even better one!  *sigh*"}
{"text":"Compared to the North Premium Outlets, this place has more of your standard stores you'd find at local malls except it's all indoors.  We walked thru the mall to see what stores are located here but stopped in at the Coach outlet.  
As it was nearing Labor Day, they started some of their sales - 50% off.  
I got a small purse which I was told there were only 2 in the store as they came from the retail store.  It was an off beige/yellow tone purse but you can tell the quality was much better with detail stitching.  Staff was helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Its not the best outlet mall to shop at but its pretty decent. There is alot of parking but when its busy its hard to find. I frequent here only because when friends come to town this is the place they wana shop at. I wish the food court had more options but i guess we cant be to picky lol. Theres quite a few stores i will admit so it takes some time to walk the entire thing unless you know what you need and where you need to go."}
{"text":"Lots of high end stores. There are some deals even by the US dollar and some with the conversion, however, this is more of a place to look than it is to actually buy unless you're really rich. I was impressed by the layout and wish that the one in Richmond, BC had a similar layout. I went to the Hallmark Outlet as I did score some Christmas stuff like nice cards that even with the exchange is a good deal. I sent out a few cards as well to some of my US friends through the hotel that we were staying at."}
{"text":"Not as great as the north las vegas outlet. Only thing they got going for them is when its extremely cold in vegas people tend to go to this one rather than the north side outlet."}
{"text":"it could be upgraded for sure. if it were a
little more functional.. I think it could be a awesome.

parking at this place is tricky.  you park on one end and the mall ends on the total opposite end.  if it circled back,  it'd really be nice.  otherwise, I think
locals and 'immigrated locals' from other cities and states know better to park exactly where they need to be.  

they have decent stores that cater to
different styles and ages.  I usually can find something here if I'm looking for something in particular.. so it's not a total waste of space.. it's also
an outlet so prices can be pretty amazing... if u come at the right time."}
{"text":"Came here directly after flying in from the airport and the cab fare was relatively inexpensive (less than $15). Since I arrived super early on a Saturday, there wasn't much foot traffic to contend with. Lots of stores, but definitely lower end compared to the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. I liked checking out the kate spade outlet here as well as the Disney outlet. There's also a Ralph Lauren here and a Brooks Brothers outlet for prepsters. It is very easy to get to the Strip from here if you take the SDX bus. The fare is $6 but the credit card swipe wasn't working on the machine at the stop, so be sure to have exact cash as no change is provided. It's 1-1/2 hours from here on the SDX bus to the North outlets. Overall, if you're a tourist and you only have time to visit one outlet mall- I would choose the north over the south!"}
{"text":"lots of window and people watching but less deals than a decade ago.  i still go in the am when its less crowded and less hot"}
{"text":"Good selection of shops, clean facilities but I am sad that the Dickies store closed."}
{"text":"This place sure has changed, and so much for the better. At the end of the day, it's not as pretty as the north outlets and there's not as many high-end places as at the north outlets. But it's become a much nicer place to shop. And it's indoors, which is nice when it's a particularly hot summer day. I also like that my favorite store, Banana Republic, is easily accessible from the parking lot. No walking through a maze of a mall required. All in all, it's a closer and easier place to shop (and park at) than the north outlets. Though, it lacks some of the \"luxury\" of the north outlets. But either way, you're gonna score some serious bargains."}
{"text":"This outlet is not bad.  There aren't as many stores as North, or other outlets, but it does the job for general shopping when you're around Las Vegas South.  This is a mostly indoor outlet, in comparison to the North Premium Outlet.  During the Summer, this outlet is the way to go to beat the heat!  There are a few Promenades with stores outdoors, but during the summer heat, we skip those all together.  There's plenty of parking outside.  I heard that we should head to the Customer Service center to get a discount card, but we skipped that.  

Overall, a nice stop before driving home from Las Vegas.  Discounted store with Nevada tax rate makes it better than buying it back home in Los Angeles! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't that great, I came here before I went to the premium outlets. I didn't find anything.. I walked out of outlet shopping with NOTHING.. (very odd for me).. The stores are typical and the prices aren't anything of outlet prices.. I wouldn't come back here.

They did have booths in the middle of the mall that sold Vegas souvenirs for a good price."}
{"text":"Nice outlet mall with a variety of stores.  Nike, Under Armour, Coach, Michael Kors, Express, and a whole lot more. Majority of the stores are inside so you won't be sweating while shopping. Nothing out of the ordinary though."}
{"text":"The outlets have a ton of store selection. I wish I had more time to visit each store. I spent most of my time at the Nike store, which I think I needed 1 full day there alone!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas and I had to check out the shopping. I'm not a huge shopper but I am a huge cheapo so if there's sales I have to check it out. Being that I'm from Hawaii I had to check out what's out there. If you don't know where the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets are, it's on the south end of the Las Vegas Strip. You can't miss it. They're open on Mon-Sat 9-9 and Sun 9-8. Here's a link if you want to check out what stores they have. 

http://www.premiumoutlets.com/

Well I was pretty impress with how big the outlet was. I  mean you're not going to have a problem finding parking. It's everywhere, you might have to walk a little but hey we all need the exercise. I mean they had almost every store I can think of and it's not only the stores I can't really buy from. They have the normal stores lol. I checked out stores like: Nike, Under Armor, Reebok, Quicksilver, pretty much every athletic store you can think of I went in. The food there was good too. 

If you're looking to shop and you don't wanna drive too far from the strip. I'd go here."}
{"text":"Let's go SHOPPING! ^_^  Compared to the Charleston outlets these are more up my alley (read: typical Joe Shmoe) with some haute shops sprinkled in.  Plus it has the Lane Bryant outlet for my fellow big girls!"}
{"text":"Indoor mall (not like LV Premium Outlets). Lots of shops and geared more toward locals. Most of the name brands are there. One in particular was very interesting -- Burlington Brands (http://www.burlingtonbrands.com/home.htm). This is like the Ross for the name brands (but very organized and nowhere as messy). Got a good number of items there at really discounted prices. Nice place."}
{"text":"I'm not really impressed with this outlet, especially compared to other ones I've been to. There aren't a lot of good stores, and when I went I didn't find that many deals. If you're coming to shop for designer items then it's worth it, otherwise you're better off shopping somewhere else. So many other malls and shopping centers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not as many stores as Las Vegas Premium Outlets North, but stilll a great place to shop. Stores are all infoors, so great place to shop when it's either REALLY hot or REALLY cold & raining outside. Located only 3 miles from Mandalay Bay. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Great place as it is air conditioned for the hot summer days. It's always fun to have so much to choose from as well as sale prices! Food courts are convenient."}
{"text":"Found some great deals, but then again I am a clearance rack shopper.  Some store were over priced, but I always turn around and walk right back out."}
{"text":"Great mall!  I'm not sure if it is necessarily outlet prices, reduce some maybe, but not outlet prices. There are a good selection of stores."}
{"text":"When I came here every shop had a sale for at least 50% if not more I got some great pants and shirts and they have all my favorite shops. My girlfriend enjoyed it too as they had a lot of the stores she really loves."}
{"text":"Underwhelming for sure. I've been to a number of the Premium Outlets,  this one was not the best I've seen. The north location is better,  with a better selection of stores. But the prices are better than full retail! 

There is a Saks Off Fifth,  but again nothing special. Picked through selection. Prices were just meh. 

I hear there is a new one being opened at the north location in 2015. 

Maybe next year!"}
{"text":"I only went looking for the Izod store because there is an Izod sign on the building. But the only Izod is in the Van Heuson store and is just a couple of racks. Waste of time for me."}
{"text":"This used to be called Belz Factory Outlets. Never liked it then, and even with the name change, I'm still not very impressed with the selection of outlet stores at this indoor mall. Most of the stores sell very outdated items, like clothing that was cool in the 90s. If you want a more modern, in-style selection, I'd recommend the Las Vegas Premium Outlets for a more extensive selection of outlet stores with good quality."}
{"text":"Great buys at Ralph Lauren Outlet today... Especially cool, take 30% or 50% off the sale price;~D  the staff here is extremely nice. A shout out to Tatiana, really appreciated her going in back to check for the sizes I wanted. The cashier was extremely helpful too & did a great job suggesting we get on the mailing list for future sales."}
{"text":"The only time I usually stop by here is for a birthday or around Christmas as there's a couple of stores that have those perfect name-brand gifts without the typical name-brand price tag.

I usually limit my time here for two reasons: More often than not, I know exactly what I need and it's sort of dingy.

Every time I've been here it's been very busy - I'm sure it's a tourist hot spot with the deals you can snag.  Still, even with the traffic, it feels like they don't keep it up.  Maybe it's just because it's an old building but everything about it just has a 'please-wipe-me-down-with-a-Lysol-wipe' feel.

I think if they did some renovations - or perhaps simply cleaned - this could actually be a nice little 'mall' since many of the restaurants in front of it are newer and very well-kept.

Will still go back for the deals."}
{"text":"Ever since I've came to Las Vegas back in 2009 I have came here. When I need a new pair of shoes I hit this mall. If you want $39, $49, $59, and all the way up to $129. Whatever you want. I prefer Nike or adidas. Usually grab 2 pairs unless I find some awesome deals I've grabbed up to 4 pairs. 


So if you haven't stopped by your missing out."}
{"text":"Service and prices are excellent. I was assisted by Jose Mejia and he's super. I know Yelp likes some basis for comparisons so I will let you know I was in 3 clothing stores in the Grand Canal shops (Pallazzo-Venetian) the same day and not impressed with anything."}
{"text":"I was happy with the deals I found but like most places you need to watch what you buy. I didn't find shoes that my oldest liked because he is picky and the deals were not that good on the styles he liked. 

The vans store isn't a deal but they always have buy one get one half off. My local store offers this same deal pretty often also. 

I love the DC outlet and the quicksilver outlet. My kids always find stuff and I save tons. 

The fox store has adorable kids stuff and it's a good deal but I can find newer styles the same price on sale other places. 

I hate the Disney store here. It is so disorganized and nothing has a price on it ever. I get so annoyed trying to guess prices but they want you to just grab and buy. They have signs with stupid pricing that makes it seem like everything is cheap but it's not."}
{"text":"now that the remodel is finished, i can give it 4 stars. they have lots of great stores now and still have awesome deals. Go visit the newly remodeled outlets if you haven't seen it since the remodel...so much better now. There are 240 stores now!"}
{"text":"Very unexpected help and savings from Michael at the cashier counter! Everyone was very helpful throughout my whole shopping experience!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't like outlets and I am not huge on shopping.  The fact that this place does not get 1 star should be an accomplishment.

There are a good number of stores here and at least it is indoors so we can go during the summer months.  Also, they did just open a Disney Store for the little ones (or maybe it has been there and we just made it that far down).  There are a decent number of chain restaurants in front of this mall like, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Five-Guys so it isn't a total loss."}
{"text":"This in side the building outlet is awesome it's not too crowded and a lot space for parking and since they add up more brand store I even like shopping here more . And we all the store all on sale the price is really a good deal ."}
{"text":"I hate this mall. It is a tourist trap, the mall and the parking lot are always crowded, the mall has some sort of artificial smell. Only reason I come here is to go to Adidas."}
{"text":"I been to the North outlet I like this one better because it is more like the mall indoor rather than out door...!
I will be back...!"}
{"text":"A decent indoor outlet shopping experience.  They have the basics: Calvin Klein, Adidas, Ann Taylor, and Guess, but I think the selection is better in the North location."}
{"text":"Honestly......   (you know its not amazing when it starts out like that)   I really thought this place would be better.   There is really no flow to the shops inside, I couldnt locate a map to find the few outlets I was there to shop at and its an all out MADHOUSE in there.   It was actually kinda confusing when I got in there and there were just so many people everywhere.  I am fine with navigating through, but when you have to fight shoppers and the kiosk employees trying to shove ecigarettes and hand steamers in your face, its kind of challenging.  The selection of stores were good, but I sensed a common theme of we dont want to help you in the whole outlet center... EXCEPT, the tommy hillfiger store where I was treated like i was being suspected of shoplifting... (i used to work LP before and I know how they do it)   I am not sure if it was just the time that I was there or not, but I guess I will go back because they are the closest option for me outlet shopping wise.    maybe an update coming soon with better results... who knows?"}
{"text":"The divier of the 2 Premium Outlets in Las Vegas, although this one has some decent stores too. The good thing about this mall is that it never gets too crowded and parking is rarely a hassle. There are also plenty of great restaurants in the area to eat at if you want to take a break from shopping. It is also the closest outlet mall to the strip if that's where you're staying!"}
{"text":"There are 2 outlet centers in Las Vegas, the NORTH and the SOUTH.

I've been to both.  If you're from or familiar with Southern California, to compare I'd say the NORTH is similar to Camarillo or Palm Desert.

The SOUTH is similar to Ontario Mills or The Citadel.

The NORTH is an outdoor shopping area, it has more stores as well as higher end (brand names) stores.  The SOUTH for the most part is an indoor mall, and has a mixture, 'tho if I had to summarize, has more working class type retail stores.

Parking is difficult at the NORTH, they have a parking structure that's covered.   Parking seemed easy over at the SOUTH.

The shopping clientele seems be comprised of more visiting tourists (and foreign ethnic)  at the NORTH and more locals (and urban ethnic) at the SOUTH. 

I like the SOUTH Premium Outlets because it's indoors.  They do have a Hugo Boss, Banana Republic and other stores here, similarly to that of the NORTH outlets too.

The selection isn't as diverse, nor as prestigious as the North Outlets, but I'd say if you have the time to go to both, it's worthwhile.  However, if you only had time to go to one, I'd say the North is a tad better for my purposes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this outlet mall. Lots of stores and surrounded by great restaurants. Not too far from the strip and lit dog great deals. Yelp checkin provides a free coupon book!"}
{"text":"This outlet sucks. Old and outdated. My local mall is better than this place.

Only thing good at this place is dunkin donuts."}
{"text":"Great prices for items especially for Rockport shoes which I bought.  They have huge discounts but prices still can be high.  I always make a point of going there when I am in Las Vegas.  Last year, my friend and relatives found some items by vendors in the aisles of the mall that were priced as good as Amazon.  As I see a directory at the mall, I snap a photo of it so I can always find a store that i past up but want to go back to.  Now we do not need to drive 30 minutes from Vegas just to get to an outlet mall."}
{"text":"You can get some good deals here. The food court ain't too shabby. The outlet has a lot of good stores. Parking is ample."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of malls of any kind, yes I know I'm a girl I should blah blah but I like going knowing what I want and where I want to get it from, came here to visit a friend that works here, it was a big outlet, bigger than the ones in LA that's for sure, it was dull and weird...never been to a mall that has rug...eh?"}
{"text":"Nike Outlet!!!! This outlet mall had several stores, but the Nike Outlet is what made me the happiest. 

They had an incredible selection of shoes for amazing prices. The customer service was great as well. 

I found exactly what I was looking for and will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Vegas. 

You need to come here!"}
{"text":"nice indoor mall with much better deals than anywhere else on the strip! i ended up buying 2 cute blouses while my friends bought some watches from fossil & purses from michael kors. the food court was dismal tho & not enough choices for me so decided to wait on eating til we got back to the strip."}
{"text":"I usually shop here during Christmas time since it's not as busy as other malls, but it's a hit or miss.  Sometimes you find what you're looking for and others you don't.  I like that they have better stores now than before.  My daughter loves the carousel so that's a plus since no other malls have that.  Their food court could use some updating."}
{"text":"Since the remodel this place has peaked. Less ghetto-fab, more let's go get some outlet priced Levis. The Nike store is legit, like kid in a candy store legit. I wish I had more time to meander and play, but tight schedules can mess with your shopping. Looking forward to going back when I've got more time to explore. 
It is kind of a looooong mall though. I think I like them stacked, as opposed to the scenic beige mile.
But other than the architecture I've got no complaints.  I think they did a great job and I think it'll be worth the gas to coast the 215 and do some heavy duty shopping."}
{"text":"Old, worn, and tired outlet mall. The only redeeming factor was that the majority was indoors. If you're looking to wander around, beat the heat, and specifically shop outlets, then this is your place. If, however, you shop best in a more updated space, then look elsewhere. 

The customer service ranges from lacking in some stores to aggressive in others, but that can be found anywhere, I suppose. For instance, my friends and I were waiting at the Pandora kiosk with exactly what we wanted in view and the woman never acknowledged us and still was doing opening duties 30 minutes after it should have been opened. Needless to say, she lost an automatic sale. 

There are staple outlet stores (Adidas, Gap, Banana Republic) and some premium like Kate Spade, Coach. The parking is ample. It's location is just south of the strip. If you need a quick supply of clothes or shoes, this will fit the bill."}
{"text":"The word \"Premium\" shouldn't be used here.  This place is outdated and I really think the selection of stores are boring.  The good news, especially in the summer time is that you have an indoor mall, unlike the North Outlets which has a much better selection of stores, but all outside.  Unless they put some more interesting stores in here, I think I will continue to bypass it."}
{"text":"Good for what I use it for, I'm not a fashionista or a super shopper but this place has got my attention. This isn't a mega super outlet, like the other ones spread across America, but it'll do. The food court is kinda lack luster and could use some chain restaurants. I find my deals here at the Van's outlet, i'm a plus size boy in the shoe dept size 15 0_o. I really like Zumiez, those are the only two shops that carry the shoes i like in my size. In spring time you can really grab some Deals because they have crazy clearance sales. Last year I got me a pair of DC's for $10 :D. The hot topic over there is HUGE and has a monster selection, so when i'm jonesing for a new band shirt i stop by. They have a few other clothing and shoe stores that might tickle your fancy. They have a toy store and other big name stores. Watch out for the Drivers over here, especially the Taxi's because these SOB's are fatal behind the wheel. Also beware of panhandlers and other pests that will try and beg in the parking lot. That aside this is a good place to get some great deals."}
{"text":"There's only so much that you can do at the strip until you're over it. So when you're in the mood to spend money for things and get a bargain at the same time. Do come here.

Let's see,, I bought snowboard pants at Columbia and Amphibian shorts at the Quiksilver shop. All great deals.

Bring comfy sneakers cause this outlet is gigantic. I definitely enjoyed my shopping experience here. Will definitely return again the next time I get a chance.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking through out the outlet plaza. But wish the inside looked more appealing to the eye. Looks a little run down and seems as though they only cared about opening the plaza, and didn't care to much about appealing to the eye with the inside design. No big complaints about the outside, which is standard or average looking compared to other outlet plaza's.

The food court could use more big names. We are at fatburger, and didn't mind it cause the employee's were nice and accommodating to my family and I. They allowed us to sample the sauces that would compliment the boneless wings we ordered. We ended up going with the Honey Garlic sauce which was flavorful to be honest. I had a shake, and watched them make it with real ice cream, which is a huge plus in my book.

Definitely won't be coming back to this outlet anytime soon. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"It's an outlet mall...full of stores, some are good, some are not....hadnt been here in 8 years so coming back was an experience...some stores remained from when last here, others have long since gone...its definitely a place to go due to the location and choices for shopping....can get very crowded at times..."}
{"text":"Great mall to shop in Las Vegas. Besides the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet, I absolutely love this mall. Shops are inside and deals are great. Stores such as Hurley, Volcom, Quiksilver, Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Pac Sun, and many other stores. Hours of operation are great and there is a food court."}
{"text":"It had been years since I have been to the Belz Mall, oh sorry the Las Vegas Premium Outlets South.  I was surprised to see the front of the shopping center have a few stores added to the outside to make it feel like the Premium outlets North.  I think those stores should have access to the interior of the mall but what do I know.  

I thought that the mall would have seen some turnover in the shopping space however these stores were the same old tired brands that have been here for at least a decade.  Ok I guess.  I am sure these stores do very well for the tourists that visit and buy an extra suitcase to drag home to their home countries.  I guess I am not a mall shopper by any means.  The mall was very clean and has been updated from my previous visits.  The prices do not seem like outlet prices though I see full price on almost everything and all the stores are priced almost identical you can tell this when you shop the dozen or so shoe stores here. 

The kiosk people could sell more stuff if they would look up from their smart phones and say HI! to someone. Just saying.  Thanks for shopping!"}
{"text":"Big mall with lots of stores.  It's kind of dimly lit and a bit depressing though.  The food court also has limited options.  I didn't walk the entire thing but the aesthetic leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Why does it smell like vomit in here? Oh wait, it's just the kiosk making buttered popcorn. Ventilation is pretty bad. You get all sorts of funky smells. And the people watching here....oh lordsssss!!!! But you're here to shop....sooooo shop away!

This outlet is alright. I'm mostly here for work attire. New York & Company and Express is where I frequent for my suits and work shirts/dresses. And Charlotte Russe, BCBG and bebe are a few stores I go to for my fashion stores. Not a lot to choose from (personally)....not a lot of other stores I'm interested in. I'm usually in and out pretty quick. Not a fan of spending a day here.

Parking is plentiful so that shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"The good thing about this outlet is that for the most part it is indoor.  There are stores where you have to go outside to enter, but those are few.  In the summer months, it is a big plus to shop in air-conditioned outlet.  Nothing special about the stores.  There are the same stores everywhere."}
{"text":"Okay mall. The exterior was updated a few years ago. And the store selection is above average. However, the interior needs to updated asap! It not only looks dated, but it looks and feels dirty. 3 stars for that fact.

Four stars only because they have a couple stores that the North Outlet doesn't have; distance from my house; and my autistic son loves this place and could be entertained for hours just walking up and down the mall over and over again."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is way south of Mandalay Bay. Must take the SDX bus. This outlet mall is mostly indoors which is nice especially when it's really hot in the summer. Lots of restaurants in the parking lot including raising canes and five guys. It is not as big as the north premium outlets"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I go to the South Premium Outlet. I like this one better than the North,  This outlet has indoor stores! Much cooler out of the heat and sun.
There are really good deals! If u have AAA CARD go to customer service and u can get a booklet that will give u more discounts"}
{"text":"I like the outlet shopping mall since they have an outrageous selection of shops and clothing!"}
{"text":"I didn't know there was a \"north\" and \"south\" so hopefully I'm reviewing the right one.

Came here for some shopping, there are stores similar to the outlet mall at Waikele, but this mall is bigger and indoor.

There weren't many stores I wanted to stop in since there are a lot back home. Tried out some places and if you look, you can find good deals."}
{"text":"Some stores that caught my attention:

UnderArmour
Aldo
DKNY
Aerosoles
Disney Outlet
BCBG Factory Outlet
Ann Taylor
Ann Taylor LOFT outlet

---

Parking is spacious and plentiful!!!  Yay.  I like that they open at 9:00.  I think it gets busier later in the day but good thing we went early.  We went right after breakfast and before an intro to lyra class.  

My friend tried to shop at Hugo Boss Outlet for a suit for her husband but it turned out to not be the one he wanted.  So no go on that.  However, the salesperson was super friendly and helpful as she tried to Facetime him to confirm whether the suit was a go or not.

My goal in Vegas for my first trip ever was not to shop but my friend loves Ann Taylor so we went there.  She tried on several suits, found 2 that looked reasonably awesome, but decided not to purchase them.  Happily, she found several tops and one for only $9!!!!  What a deal.  I found 2 cardigans (which makes me happy because I have been searching for colorful cardigans for 2 years now...ones that fit me well), a work dress that's super comfortable, and a lovely necklace from Ann Taylor.  I also picked up a cardigan each for my mom and aunt.

I would come back here, but it wouldn't be top of my list simply because I'm not huge on massive shopping trips when I travel."}
{"text":"This mall has really improved over the 7ish years. It used to be a dump of a few stores only known for the easily accessible restaurants.  2 years ago, it officially became a Premium outlet mall; tons of stores that differ from the North outlets (off of the 15, closer to Fremont St.).  Parking isn't as atrocious as the North mall either.  Great food court and great surrounding sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"There should be requirements to list yourself as an OUTLET mall .. because this place is AS expensive and/or MORE expensive as any other store. I see no good bargains here and I am disappointed Burlington is no longer there :( I went into the Hanes store and met up with a real nice sales gal that helped me get a 10 pack of pantyhose she explained to me that although I am a B or C size - I should get Queen -- they are easier to get on and WAY more comfortable :) so this little tidbit made the whole trip worthwhile ;) It's a good shopping mall but don't expect to find anything at any great savings because you won't."}
{"text":"I've been here way more times than I can count, yet I have still not written a review about it. Located on Las Vegas Blvd. and Warm Springs Rd, this outlet is on the south end of town, hence the name. It's an indoor outlet with a few stores outside. Although the facade has been completely redone, the inside is in desperate need of a makeover. It's dark and drab and just plain tired looking. There are 2 food courts and a bunch of stand alone spots to get a snack, like Auntie Anne's pretzels and Cinnabon. There are restaurants that share the same plaza as the outlet, like Outback Steakhouse and Chipotle, if the food court isn't to your liking. Parking is much easier here compared to the North outlet. And the stores here are more of your everyday stores, while the North outlet has higher end brands. This your basic outlet that provides your basic shopping needs. Nothing fancy. 

P.S. Check in and get a free coupon book at guest services located at the food court on the Nike side of the outlet. There are a few good deals in there."}
{"text":"I prefer the South Premium Outlet than the North.
The shopping center has less brands or stores but most of the stores are indoor so when it's windy, too hot or too cold, raining you don't really suffer because of it (few stores have their entrance facing the parking lot like Coach, Gap, Loft, Michael Khors)
I did not want to experience black friday so i swing by later today (i am pretty sure they will extend till tomorrow Monday their \" super deal \"
Coach offered 70% off on everything and additional 20% on selective items
Gap offered 60% off on everything full price and 50% on reduced items
Banana Republic offered 60% off on everything
Kate Spade offered 70% of most of their product
did not check other stores
Enjoy you shopping!"}
{"text":"The outlet is comparable to the livermore outlets as they are not as big as vacaville or gilroy. You can take the bus from the strip to get here. Nothing too amazing and I would not recommend to go out of your way here unless you have lots of time to kill."}
{"text":"This indoor outlet is like a regular mall. However I like the north outlet better. Some stores like Nine West, Coach, and Nike Outlet, offer great deals. Others seem to be regular prices. 

There's a food court, and small snack and other vendors along the walkways. Some of the stores are located outside of the mall as well."}
{"text":"If you need a suit, Perry Ellis at the outlet mall is the place to go. We got ours for less than $178, includes jacket, pant, vest, tie and shirt!!! It's Perry Ellis! What more can you ask for??!!! Awesome customer service from Jaime. She helped us put the whole thing together and she went above and beyond offering the shirt, tie and vest. So with the amazing prices, awesome customer service and clean store... I say this is the best man-shopping I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place can make you a bit claustrophobic, especially if you've frequented the  LV North Premium Outlets. Here's how it sizes up:

-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)
-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)
-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)
-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options
-lacks that \"touristy\" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggage

Despite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust."}
{"text":"An older outlet store with an almost Boulevard Mall appeal.  Some higher end shops can be found.  This is a good athletic wear store mall.  Not too out of style but if you want Movado you would have to go to the newer premium outlet store.  This is more accustomed to receive the locals than that other Premium Outlet location though.  Easy parking, easy walk through.  I do not live for consumerist values but none are immune in this country.  With that said this is a favorite mall for my mandatory gift hunting needs.  

The biggest appeal to this outlet used to be the now defunct merry-go-round that my kids used to love.  It sadly has moved on to greener pastures.  You should have seen the tears on my sons face when we learned it has been removed :'( so saddening.  Alas' we had to make a special trip the Circus Circus Adventuredome after that trip..  If I recall correctly there are 2 food court areas with the usual mall fare.  Nothing out of the culinary norm for a mall.  Most stores are discounted at unusually higher percentage.  There are some hold out stores that I would not waste the extra drive to go for.  Mainly the Crocs store (side note: for my kids) and the little bodega type stands are gimmicky rip offs.

Do your research and check if the stores you are looking for are here before coming down.  Not a bad place to shop.  Tourist levels are moderate compared to the newer Premium.  Parking is right in front of the stores and it is easily laid out in a single horizontal grid.  If you're hungry there is a Raising Canes and a Buffalo Wild WIngs in the same parking lot.  Good little outlet."}
{"text":"This is a big mall. Lots of walking and shopping to be done. The mall has a little bit of everything. Went there to shop for hockey jerseys and bought a few other item."}
{"text":"does anybody know where burlington moved to?"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this outlet. We were looking for a toiletry bag and decided to come here. We wandered in and out of a few stores. We found a nice option at Vera Bradley but wanted to check a few other stores before deciding. We finally found the perfect bag at Samsonite. With our mission accomplished, we didn't go to any other stores. I like that this is an indoor mall since you can take a break from the hot Vegas weather. I usually shop at the North outlet but would not have any issue returning to this mall."}
{"text":"We live close to the outlets so we find ourselves here every once and awhile.  This place can get packed from all the tourists.  The corridors are very narrow so it feels a little smaller than it really is.  This place is hit and miss when it comes to the prices.  Sometimes you can walk into a store and find some good deals.  We treat this place more like a mall than an outlet center.  It always fun to go walk around and check out the different stores.  The have a big carsoul in it too.  So we always take my daughter for a ride.  This is also a place to walk a few laps if you eat at a restaurant next to it.  If you are in Vegas or if you live here and have visitors then you have to bring to the outlet mall.  Don't get me wrong there are some good deals here.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I use to work at this outlet center a few years ago, and I agree with Misti on her selection of store.   Here's my advice to anyone who goes to the any of the premium outlets, before going to visiting any of these Malls...go to their website, and sign up for one of their coupon books.   The mall management will take a few days to reply back by E-mail, but it will give you a free coupon book for most of the outlet stores, and it doesn't cost anything if you do that, or you can buy one at customer service for 5 or 10 dollars.   
One major suggestion, don't use a Las Vegas address, because they use to give the Las Vegas locals a hard time with this.   On the other hand,  I did it a few months ago, and got the E-mail print out from the mall management, I had no problem getting the coupon booklet without showing any ID to guest services.

{"text":"Local here talking about the one of the Disney Store Outlets in town. As a native Los Angelino and long time Mouse fan, I come with a bit more insight than most on the subject of Disney merchandise at the retail level. This is a good store for locals and visitors alike to get their hands on merchandise not found in any of the Downtown Disney superstores found in Anaheim, CA or Orlando, FL. However, with that in mind, you're not getting anything from Downtown Disney here either. Clever marketing? For a super Disney geek like me, YES!

It's located at the far southern end of the mall so park accordingly or be prepared to walk mall lengths accordingly. Getting a good parking spot is usually a breeze because locals generally don't go to this mall and most visitors are at the other Premium Outlets on Grand Central Parkway and rightfully so since those a touch more inviting.

Staff here are also called Cast Members. So the courtesy and level of service you'd expect at any Disney property can be expected here. They are knowledgeable, helpful and super friendly to a fault. 

The collection of merchandise especially for children was astounding considering the generally small display space that they have to work with. By comparison to the Anaheim's Downtown Disney's layout, the outlet store is less than one general section of the Downtown Disney layout and probably no more than half of that. Yet the selection was amazing by comparison because most of what I saw on display was not available in Downtown Disney. Star Wars products for kids took up only 15 feet of wall space but it was on display from the floor to the ceiling so you got to see a lot more than a couple of racks of clothes or a few shelves of toys. Pajamas, Stormtrooper outfits, light sabers, action figures, lunch pails, backpacks and you're not just getting stuff from the movies: There are products related to the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series here, too! If you want outfit your little Jedi master or Sith lord for Halloween, he or she will show up in style for both trick or treating or parties. The Marvel products filled well over 25 feet of wall space in the same manner and were prominently paraded about the store. The iconic princess products were on full display on the other main wall of this store and equally as impressive. The general floor space paraded a myriad of interesting and very cool products from all the other Disney properties including classics like Mickey, Minnie, and Donald all the way to the presently new properties like Frozen, Maleficent and Big Hero 6. The selection of clothing for adults was modest and may be judged as small by some but it's eclectic and also rare nonetheless. I found a Star War T-shirt my size that I have not seen in any store, Disney or otherwise. The biggest and deepest Disney enthusiast would be very pleased to find new and exciting treasures here. Friends, nerd and geek yourself out!

What's my bottom line? This store is about anything you can't find at a Downtown Disney for the Disney enthusiast. Some may say some items are pricey. I say the rarity in ideas, style and taste justify that and all items are priced properly. The only drawback really is no IMAX but that does not stop me from coming here. The only drawback IMO is floor space. I want more! LOL My actual rating is a solid 5.0 stars..."}
{"text":"My family and I are outlet mall veterans. We have been going to so many outlet malls for many years. This one was pretty good all things considered. We bought a lot of stuff at this outlet. 

-Ann Taylor: great selection of clearance especially if you're petite. My sister is one of those 00P girls and it's hard to find clothes that fit her.

-Kate spade: so much stuff here. They were having a cool 60% off plus 20% off on most of the store. I bought a bag for $55 which is super unheard of in Kate spade.

-Columbia: a lot of good stuff here. Especially with sales it's much more affordable and the quality is pretty good. You don't have to sacrifice style here. I got a sweet winter coat for $140 and it normally goes for $299.

There are two food courts. The first one is pretty lackluster. The second one seemed to have better food options. I wouldn't bank on excellent dining experiences here regardless."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation on our first day,the sales were amazing, I got almost everything I could of hoped for!"}
{"text":"Hey... its convenient and easier to park then the new one near downtown. I think my wife prefers the downtown factory mall but I refuse to fight the horible traffic there and always bring her to this one instead.."}
{"text":"If you love last season's fashions and sketchy perfume shops then this is your shopping oasis. 

Wow this place has not changed since I was kid. I used to scarf down Sbarro pizza slices, shop regularly at Hot Topic and laugh at the people who were buying \"Big Dog\" t-Shirts. Nowadays, I still do all of the above; at the moment I'm wearing a tie-dye Family Guy shirt while sipping some Joe out of my Lamb of God coffee mug. 

A quarter mile of pure international craziness, it's like landing at JFK Airport. This has to be the must stop place in Vegas for people visiting from all over the world with Saturdays and Sundays being the busiest. I was here recently to get some new gym shoes and the Nike store was nuts to butts packed full of multi-lingual people all clamoring for those discounted SBs and Air Max joints. 

Not everything in here is a fake or a bootleg product. There are plenty of legit stores who just need to sell that extra inventory like the aforementioned Nike plus Puma, PacSun, Adidas, Coach, Disney Stores, Under Amour, Converse and my personal favorite, The Kitchen Collection. Which is the only store in this place that sells dope ass kitchenware at outlet prices. Why do I know this, because I love to cook!

** Sip Sip ** Mmmm, this Lamb of God mug makes the coffee taste so delicious. 

I am not knocking this place one bit, great prices on name brand stuff. Shopping here just requires a lot of patience, patience I don't normally have. You really need to psyche yourself up when coming here, trust me, this isn't your daddy's stroll through the mall, this is pure Outlet Mall warfare and with holidays coming up, I advise you to pack a flask just to take the edge off. 

Keep your eyes on the horizon, because your shopping oasis is just beyond Auntie Anne's Soft Pretzels."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. I wish I got the names of the two sales people helping us because they went out of their way to make it an easy experience. My son has flat feet I asked them if they could help and they went way beyond helping. Very happy with them very nice people keep it up"}
{"text":"Good place for summer shopping as half shops are indoor and you can image the hot in las vegas. But less brands and smaller shop scale compare to north one."}
{"text":"Not my favorite of the outlets.. felt like I was at a westfield mall. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 star rating for me. I liked this outlet too. We hit it on our way back to LA. Its right next to Buffalo Bills of teh 15 and easy in and out. That said, it has a large parking lot with no parking issues. It is very nice indoors and not crowded at all. 

We hit Williams Sonoma, Charlotte Russe, Coach, Juicy Couture, Bally, Nike, and Tommy Bahama. Easy to navigate. Good stores. Juicy Couture and Mike were better here than at North."}
{"text":"Came here on 7/5/13. This mall is cramped and decent, at best. Stores are so blah that it's boring to shop there. 

Also, NEW YORK & COMPANY is a joke. Here's why: My gf tried on a few things that when she came out to ask me what I thought, a few employees whispered in each others ears and laughed. It took SOOOO much effort not to say something. Instead, I took the bracelet my gf wanted to buy and put them aside. I WASN'T going to let her spend a penny in that shit-hole. In fact, I wanted to get the clothes she tried on and wipe the floor with them. But I took the high road bc what can I do to those employees who laughed at us? They work at New York & Company making $8.00 an hour. So I ultimately have the last laugh. Losers!"}
{"text":"Lots of good shopping and looking at trendy shops. I say 2 food courts ? really...bought a pair of new balance shoes. Great selection of shoes & sizes to choose from. Finding \"BIG FOOT\" shoes that fit is always a challenge"}
{"text":"We have one here in Charlotte, but all the stores are outside, so I was surprised at how it was an inside outlet store.  They had a lot of great stores, I went on a Sunday afternoon before my plane left and it was a great crowd, I really don't like going to the malls because of crowds. I bought a \"Mother's Day\" pair of Steph Curry's that are back on sale online, but saved $35 with discounts and a pair osh kosh shoes, my experience was  great to say the least."}
{"text":"Great variety of stores and tons of discounts. My only real problem with this outlet is that you are going to be harassed every 20 paces by someone in a kiosk. It makes for an unpleasant experience in an otherwise great outlet mall."}
{"text":"I found great deals here....Yes, yes I had to buy an extra rolling suit case for all the things I needed (wanted) from the mall. I wanted to bring home the GAP, what can I say?"}
{"text":"Las Vegas South Premium Outlets is a huge outlet mall where you can find exactly what you're looking for and save some money too. We have been shopping here for years and have saved a sizable chunk of change on clothing, kitchenware, linens, handbags, and more. Here's a sample of what you might save:

* Vanity Fair Outlet: 3 pairs of short for $39.98 each. On sale for $15.99 each. Savings of $71.97!
* The Jockey Store: Multi-pack of underwear for $22.50 each and Silver Line Night Shirt for $30. On sale for $19.98. If you are a Jockey Rewards, you receive store certificates in the mail for your purchases. With $20 in rewards, these were for FREE - savings of $52.50!
* Quiksilver: Shorts for $34.99 each. On sale for $25 each. Savings of $20!
* Van Heusen: Double pleated twill pants for $56 each. On sale for $16.80 each. Savings of $78.40!
* Total savings of $222.87! I love saving money! :)"}
{"text":"I really like coming here.  This is the closest thing to a mall on our side of town.  Love the stores, selection can be scarce depending on the time of year you visit. 

DC shoe store, knick knack 99 cent charms, Journeys,  Kitchen Collections are some of the stores I like to check out. 

 I have to say Hot Topic has changed a lot... You can still order Tripp Pants in store but they don't carry them in store any longer.

 I LOVE Auntie Anne's Pretzels.  They have a rewards program & mobile app you get a free pretzel for your birthday & again for the free sign up.  Big food court, Dunkin Donuts & a really nice stand alone places. 

Silk Dermalactive is ultra high end but worth every penny! Excellent skin treatment.  Their profession is removing wrinkles. It will take 20 years off your face.  If you have time you should stop & try the lotion samples. I even liked their Deep Collagen Care mask, removed my black heads after 20 minutes of sitting on my face & wiped it off. It was like magic, my skin is softer too. Also I HIGHLY recommend the Facial Peel, it cleans up Psoriasis, Rosacea, even my SEVERE Eczema on my wrist!! I couldn't believe my eyes when the dead skin came off. No gimmicks, I was a skeptical at first but it WORKS & it's worth the money. This same exact stuff is used in the Bellagio Spa, so you know it's a brand they stand by.


As for families with kids there's honestly not much at all for them.  One Disney store, watch out! Lol

There's always new stores constantly popping up. I like to check out it every so often."}
{"text":"When I got to the airport back home, I realized I forgot to bring a bathing suit. What? No pool time?! I had to do something about it when we landed. Since we rented a car, I realized the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets were close to the airport. We stopped by on Wednesday, May 10th around 5:15pm.

My only mission was to find a bikini, so I only walked into stores which a selection of suits you could see from walking around the mall. I'm tall and on the smaller side, so I was specifically looking for a bikini with ties both on the top and the bottom. I started out at Quicksilver. I didn't like their selection as everything had some kind of pattern I wasn't drawn to. (I like suits on the plain side.) Next up was O'Neill. I found solid colored suits here, but most of the tops only tied around the neck. Not in the back as well. Not wanting to settle, we roamed around some more and found a PacSun. I ended up grabbing a white bikini here for around $50. Tied in the neck and back on the top and on the sides on the bottom. Perfect for me as I didn't need to worry about it fitting perfectly. I could just adjust the ties everywhere.

I've been to the North Outlets before and feel like they have more of a selection. But I'm glad I found what I needed here. And it was super convenient as it was on our way from our car rental to our hotel. In a pinch, this outlet will do. And it won't hurt the pocketbook too much."}
{"text":"Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall has always been just there for me. What I mean by that is I know it's there but I don't run to them at the thought of wanting to shop. My family was visiting from Minnesota this past weekend and it was my dads goal to hit all the outlets up before returning home. We headed down to this location on his last day and actually ended up with no too much of luck when it came to shopping! 

My little brothers were looking for a few items for the whole back to school shopping thing and specifically with shoes! The NIKE store here actually happens to be a bit better than the South location. Prior to coming to this location we had no luck at the others. Other than this story there really was no saving grace. 

I guess it all comes down to exactly what you may be looking for before deciding to come to shop here. So if you happen to come make sure you put on your handy dandy walking shoes! This mall is never-ending haha! Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this outlet now you have to pay $5.00 parking. You go to other outlets they don't charge for parking, you go to outlet malls for good deals not start off your shopping and have to pay for parking only if you live in Vegas you don't have to pay so all the out of town people go to another outlet they have the Las Vegas North outlet it's free parking."}
{"text":"It may look a bit.. uhmmm.. what's the word I'm looking for... ghetto but don't be alarmed by it's exterior. There are actually some decent stores if you walk around. 

It did have a flea market type feel because of the stands throughout selling 99 cents keychains and what not. Good for tourists on a tight budget for souvenirs. 

They do have a fantastic Nike and Adidas original outlet. Nice deals in there. 

Would I come back here? Yea, probably but just to select stores. (And those delicious DOMINO cookies at Great American Cookie!)"}
{"text":"I actually like this outlet more than the Premium Outlets- North. 

For one, it's indoors so weather is not the enemy.   

Two, it's less crowded, so no need to maneuver your way through the hordes of people.  

Three, the stores carry more of what I want here. Actually, maybe number 3 might not be a good thing because it means that I spend more money.  

Four, parking is not as painful. You're almost guaranteed to find a parking spot.  

Five, I think more locals come to this one. Probably because they're fed up with parking at the other one.  

So, if you happen to be in Vegas and want another outlet option, give this one a try."}
{"text":"Not so many favorite brands except UA and NB. Actually we just have a 2hr trip there. And I hate the promotion of 'buy one get one % discount', so complicated and have to buy more....."}
{"text":"WOW !!! Good buys abound !!!

My friend Erin and I had a BALL here!!!  Yes it is very 1980's but who CARES?  The prices are a scream!!  Yes there are a few stores that are just \"there\" basically regular priced stuff - but if you want to do some serious shopping THIS is the place to come!! Liz Claiborne (TWO full shopping bags later!! I really scored here because I was shopping for my Mom - she is a teeny tiny petite woman not to mention a screaming leopard two-piece skirt outfit for me!! Paid 90.00 for both pieces only to find the EXACT same outfit in Canada for 350.00 It was identical !! )  Coach rocks and they are not afraid to mark stuff DOWN either!!  I loved the Rockport store nice shoes for 27.00 (regular 90.00) A very friendly store that has amazing prices in the mall is Fossil !! Bought not one but two bags !! I still use them :)  And a very cool necklace.  I had to make a trip to the car to unload the parcels !! I also found a nice jacket for my Dear Dad and some \"kitschy\" Vegas souvenirs from the kiosk in the mall.  Its a great mall - not too fancy but has GREAT deals - I mean who really CARES how \"up-to-date\" a mall \"looks\"?  I'd rather have lower prices - and REALLY great customer service in all the stores! Besides after you go to your car and \"unload\" your purchases (in the trunk!!) You can scoot over to Chilis for lunch then go to Saks Fifth Avenue clearance store which is in the same parking lot adjacent to the mall in a little strip itself - still affilliated with the mall itself.  Its a great place and will continue to shop there!!  Its my first STOP !!!"}
{"text":"Wird schön angepriesen doch wer in den USA unterwegs ist findet bessere und preiswertere Outlets. Also abwarten und die Zeit in Vegas besser nutzen. Lohnt nicht."}
{"text":"Not the best outlet I ever been to. Choice of stores was ok nothing special and price was ok."}
{"text":"Cool place. Under roof with A/C. In this place that is a must. 
Plenty of stores to choose from. Different places to eat as well. 
Not far from the Las Vegas strip. 
Next time we are in the area we will come back."}
{"text":"This place is so ghetto.  Lots of shady looking people.  Lots of stores that you would find at a lower-level outlet mall including a number of mom & pop store.  Went into the Brooks Brothers outlet, which was one of the worst I've ever seen.  Three salespeople standing around an otherwise empty store talking to each other, no greeting or any offer to help.

The north outlet is a lot better and much more upscale.  Skip this one and go there."}
{"text":"Average outlet mall with a ton of potential

There is no doubt, this place needs a facelift real bad. Management remodeled the exterior a few years ago and it was a massive improvement. Unfortunately the interior does not mirror the exterior at all. The inside is boring and definitely needs a makeover. Lack of atmosphere at an outlet mall may sound like an odd complaint, but cramped walkways and uninspired signage make for a boring shopping experience. 

There are a good number of decent outlets: Nike, Polo, Levis and the like, but there are also plenty of no-name shops full of random junk. Parking is usually a breeze but it does get packed around the holidays. Dining options are limiting to common food court fare, no restaurants at all; you are probably better off going to the eateries right outside of the mall. The outlets are getting better every year and lets hope they do a full redesign and turn this place into a proper shopping mall."}

{"text":"Pretty big outlet, I didn't buy anything here. There wasn't much to see or find here in my opinion. I saw a lot of little souvenir shops and didn't see many stores that I would like to go to. Just isn't that great of an outlet to me."}
{"text":"This place is so GHETTO! Maybe my standard of shopping is a tad higher but this place was horrible.  If you want to really do some outlet shopping go to the new Premium Outlets 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"The North beats the South in this one. The outlet here is closer to you if you are staying on the south side of the strip but if you can, make the trek up to the North outlets. It has improved a lot since I last came when it was the BELZ outlet center so it's getting there but not up the standards of the north.

The shops are pretty plentiful. Remember to check in at the guest services center for a free coupon box. (Could be handy if you plan on splurging) The whole complex is a mish mosh of stores. Not as high end as the ones in the North but there are some decent ones. There seemed to be a lot of empty shops as well.  Get your walking shoes on because it is one LONG straight path from the top to the bottom. If you want more shopping, there is an outside promenade with some more shops!

So get your shop on. It's aite but if you have the time and the money, I'd hit up the north ones afterwards or instead."}
{"text":"Well no doubt this is the best place i visited so far during my vacation here in Vegas. Now i see a lot you have only given this place 3 stars...but i must tell you i have been to SEVERAL outlet malls across this entire country....and i am telling you this one is one of the best. Now before you all go and say something like WOW...or he is CRAZY....let me just say most outlets i visit are of the PREMIUM variety. However those are not usually affordable despite the fact they are OUTLETS...so being that this one is affordable.... out of the weather elements....and close to the STRIP...it is definitely one of the best i have ever visited.

The uniform sports company is simply outstanding.....and if you are shopping for anything pertaining to your favorite sports team ...this place has no equal. Trust me i am the biggest sports fan there is......and trust me in all my travels across this great land....again there is no sports store of any kind that could compete with these guys. I literally had to leave for a few minutes and gather myself...because i was prepared to spend hundreds of dollars in there....LOL. 

So next time your in Vegas....and your ready to do some shopping PLEASE go to this locale before you go ANYWHERE else.....or you will be SORRY....Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 stars.  I usually frequent the North Las Vegas Premium Outlets and I was pleasantly surprised by my last visit.  They have a lot of the same stores as the North Vegas shops and it is indoor.  What turns me off is the fluorescent lighting and ghetto-look inside.  The outside looks nice but inside looks depressing.  The Nike here I feel is better stocked and less chaotic than the North Vegas outlets.  So is the Coach outlet store.  It was well organized and clean.  I usually hit up the same stores as I do at the North Vegas outlets: Coach, Michael Kors, Nike, Banana Republic, Aldo.  There is a larger Converse outlet here as well... WHOA... I got a new pair of Jack Purcells and some new gray chucks with the buy one get one 50% off deal.  Score.  This trip I also stopped at the Lids store and got a LA Dodgers cap that I feel that I should have just cus.  Only when I am living outside of LA will I wear my Lakers and Dodger gear.  I got a new bag at Coach and got some stuff for my mom there for Mother's Day.  Pretty successful in my opinion."}
{"text":"I remember going to this mall when it was Belz mall. When it was Belz mall it was pretty mediocre, there were some shops I liked but others not so much. I preferred the Premium Outlet Mall in downtown instead although that one is an outdoor mall and I have been there when it was extremely hot and extremely cold and not fun. Anyway just came here for a visit the other day and it has totally changed. I think this outlet center is now owned by the same company as the one in downtown. Anyway, I am from Hawaii and they have all those lovely casual surf brands I dig. Hit up the Volcom store and browsed some of the other stores there. I so totally coming here when I have kids one day. Stocking up on their clothes at the beginning of the school year is my plan. Anyway, I think the mall is improving from when it was Belz mall. I much rather come to this indoor one instead of the one in downtown."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I don't know. The word that keeps popping in my head is \"craptastic!\" I get weird vibes in the mall and I can't put my finger on it. It feels claustrophobic and outdated. The beige paint is making me crazy. The $13 dole whip in a pineapple just makes me angry. The kiosk people are more aggressive than I'm used to & there is a kiosk selling  sticky balls. Literally. Im referring to those balls that stick to the wall, often found at the prize counter of a children's entertainment center. 

A long time ago this was a local deal shoppers place to find little gems. It's not a total loss, Vans, Levi, Hot Topic & Nike are worth a peruse where you may still find little gems."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of options for store outlets, which is great for those that are shopping fiends.  It's a fair mix of tourists and locals that come here on any given day.  

The restrooms at the south end are the cleanest.  The food courts serve their function. 

It can get very, very crowded, so if you do not like crowds (I don't), make sure to mentally prepare yourself for that (like I do).  

The parking lot is extensive, and it too can get packed, particulary around major holidays.  

All in all, a pretty good outlet mall."}
{"text":"this is not the best Outlet shopping you'll ever experience... .but then again, what is?  it is Outlet shipping after all.....

it has lots of good stores mixed up with a lot of crappy swap meet type stores.  its the mixed bag of outlet malls. 

my mother likes to come here when she visits Vegas (she calls it \"Beltz\" when it actually was \"Belz\").  apparently this placed changed from \"Belz\" to \"Premium Outlets -South\"
 - this little change confused the crap out of me b/c there are now South and North outlet malls.  

there are 2 food courts, 1 large carousel for the kids, and plenty of opportunity to save money.... check it out, but do not expect \"Forum Shops\" quality...."}
{"text":"I usually visit the outlet mall every time I'm in Vegas.  I prefer the south outlet during the summer months for the inside mall design.  Chicos and Vera Bradley are my absolute stops.  The selection of shops is great and the location and parking are easy with prices that you can afford."}
{"text":"My favorite place to shop while in Vegas. All the stores I need for clothing and shoes. Prices are reasonable too. We plan trips to Vegas just to buy clothes here."}
{"text":"get their $5 coupon good.  lots of valid discounts."}
{"text":"Used to be called LVOC....not the most happening outlets, but I am a low-key, simple gal, and just enjoy the hunt for a bargain. 

Got a few great deals, and purteeee happy to have come upon them too!

Take Deuce to get there; cinch.

Good enough for me....this is not super high end. Warning..."}
{"text":"So many things have changed here it's unbelievable! Since the remodel this outlet have had an onslaught of new stores come to the outlet. The revamp has really upped the caliber of this outlet. Stores like Anne Klein, True Religion, Aldo, and more have taken this outlet experience to the max. Honestly, I had all but stopped coming to this outlet unless I wanted to go to Saks off 5th but now I think Premium has given me reason to return here more often. 

I find that this location is easier to navigate than the mixed up jumble of building at the North location. Plus parking at this location tends to be easier... At least in my eyes! It think the caliber of stores have been stepped up to the level of the North but unfortunately it does not eliminate the need to got the North location! (Sad reality is-  North is still larger and offers a great many stores not offered in this outlet.)   

Overall, I think I will be back and I would suggest this place to those who want the outlet experience.

FYI- Outlet shopping is a fine art. The more retail looking an outlet becomes the less outlet it becomes. Additionally, when shopping we'll know brands if you haven't seen the item in stores or catalogs it is a \"made for outlet item!\" Lastly, always do a quality check on items before purchase, because if it's way cheaper that retail there may be a good reason for it! Happy shopping my Loves! Muah!!"}
{"text":"This place has some great shops but the amount of annoying tourists that shop here can be overwhelming. Sometimes there are even lines at kind of normal standard shops which is insane. I've always got what I needed but just be prepared for gnarly parking and an intense vibe"}
{"text":"This Outlet has a lot of stores that you can shop at but be ready to walk around a lot! It's really close and right next to the vegas hotels! They also have a Dunkin Doughnut across the plaza from the shopping stores!"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of places to spend some money!

It's a giant outlet, located on the south end of the strip. It's indoor, inside of outside like the North end one. 

They've got probably everything you'd want or need.  Prices seem pretty decent."}
{"text":"A couple of decent stores, like Michael Kors, Vera Bradley (which had a great 50%-70% off the entire store sale going on), but other than that, I wish that we had either driven a little further to next outlet mall with Tory Burch and higher end stores, or just not gone at all.  At least we got some really good deals at some other stores that were closing out, but next time, I think we'll skip the Las Vegas Premium outlets."}
{"text":"Surprised the mall didn't suck..
Great vans, Nike, pac sun outlets. 
Halls are narrow and mall poorly designed, so it gets hectic and busy."}
{"text":"These outlets still need work, the outside stores are better than the ones inside but I would say go to the location on the north end of the strip."}
{"text":"This is an enclosed outlet mall. I visited Express & New York and Company. Good deals in each store. The mall is pretty basic and standard. Glad it was enclosed since you can get out the heat. I recommend going to the clearance racks first since you can find deep discounts for merchandise. Parking is easy and simple. Would come back again."}
{"text":"The selection of stores is okay. I came here mainly for the Nike factory outlet. I came out with a Vegas Knights license plate frame from a small hockey shop.

Inside the food court, there was an Easter Bunny that your kids could take pictures with. Unfortunately it did not have any specific hours or days that he was there but I was there on a Thursday."}
{"text":"When I think of Outlet, I think of bargains. Most stores charge the same price as their normal everyday store. It is nice having all the stores in one location, just want deals."}
{"text":"Needed some boots for the Las Vegas Invitational 7s tourney, went to the Nike outlet. Not a bad selection and the service was great. 

id have to go here during the day to see whts it all about rather than at 9am."}
{"text":"I like coming to this outlet. Doesn't seem as busy as the one off of Charleston even though there is a store or two that they don't have. Parking can be a bit crazy but a little walk never stopped me from shopping here."}
{"text":"We finally paid a visit to this outlet after 7 YEARS and its a cool place to pick up some great deals. Its cool that the shops are indoors especially with this nippy weather.

I like going to the Puma store(Puma Suedes) as well as the Adidas Originals (NOT Adidas) store where they carry the old school stuff (Shell toes, Gazelles)  and even the Star Wars line can be found here...on this visit, no finds for me....Oh well, there's always next time....ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(147/365) \"Deal Or No Deal\""}
{"text":"Yep now they are getting that renovation that they sorely needed.  It should look like nice when they are done.  I went to a few stores here on my out of town and found some really good bargains...but then again EVERY TIME I come here I find good prices.  This is truly an OUTLET mall not like all the other fake ones out there!

If this mall has a store you like you should check it out because you are likely to get a really good deal.  Whenever I'm in Vegas I try to come by here and do some shopping before heading home."}
{"text":"Nice area different stores and it's in doors which is great for Vegas weather, there was no sales however I did notice that if you go on the weekend you will get more of a deal. Can anyone explain to me why a cup of water is not free on Vegas?? Went to Starbucks and got charge !1.50 for a cup of ice I wanted with my drink!"}
{"text":"The only Adidas Originals outlet store in the universe! End of story."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this mall by friends on a Black Friday a few years back.  Since then I have stopped in at least once a year.  For friends from Phoenix it is about twice as big as the outlets at Anthem and the yet to open Outlets at Westgate, and it is indoors!  While mostly geared towards clothing and accessories there are a few kitchen places and during the holiday season a couple of specialty food stores.  I won't go in to detail about how much money I have spent here over the years. :-)"}
{"text":"Wow never have been to an indoor outlet mall before. The aisles are a bit narrow considering the size of the crowds and the close proximity to the airport. My daughter said the Ladies Room smelled and was dirty. The upside to this place has a strong air conditioning system, free wi fi and parking."}
{"text":"While people who have outlet stores near them may grant this venue a star or two less, I (as a person isolated from outlet malls) really appreciate this mall.

It has a lot of stores and kiosks, although not all of the stores you'll find here are true \"outlet\" stores. The food courts are practically mirror images of each other, with pizza, subs, chinese food and a few other similar fast food spots on each side.

Bring your walking shoes- and don't forget to check out the \"Disney\" outlet across the street."}
{"text":"A good recommendation for people who travel and visit Las Vegas and is looking for fair price on things to shop for. They have a wide variety of shops from your favorite Michael Kors, Coach, and Fossil. They also have great shoe stores like ALDO, Shoe Rack, and more. If you're also lookign for luggage to purchase last minute and for a decent price, I'd go here. They have a full selection with more than one store to choose from, and they are all at a decent price. You can also expect to find fashion stores for your lovely teenagers and for you youngin's out there looking for a quick go to clubbing outfit like Charlotte Russe, Wet Seal, and Rue 21. You can also find swim shops like PacSun, Rip Curl, Hurley, and more for your last minute swimsuites for the day clubs. They are year round so you'll always find swimsuits. Definitely a great recommendation and a local find if you're looking to shop big without burning a huge hole in your pocket!"}
{"text":"Large selection of stores and it's inside unlike the North mall.  Plenty of parking and easy access from the 15."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the outdoor parking.  On a sweltering summer's day I am not too keen on walking around the parking lot looking for my car then suffering 1st degree burns from the hot seat.
It does have some of the brands I like & they are in an A/C enclosed setting so that was a plus.  Now the food court is truly pathetic.  Talk about having to choose from Bad or really bad food."}
{"text":"\"I'm from the hood though, like really really really from the hood though.\"

These outlets are HOOD. How so? It looks like the interior has not been updated since the late 80s/early 90s. But as my momma says, \"beggars can't be choosy.\" In other words: if you're takin yourself to the outlet you can't expect it to be of 5 star caliber aesthetic wise.

I came on black Friday. We got there right before the midnight madness started. Considering the \"hoodish\"ness of the outlet, there are some nice stores like Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein and Adidas. Not much deals going on there. Taking the less frou frou options, I found my deals at Wet Seal, Hot Topic and the Watch Outlet. I got me two band t-shirts, a girly top, some shorts, and a watch for under $75. Not bad, right?

I still prefer Prim to this location, but I'm not gonna knock this place. Smart shoppers are smart shoppers. If you can't take the heat, then don't go to an outlet!"}
{"text":"Lots of stores.  A decent food court.  And many restaurants to choose from in the parking lot.  The Under Armour store is awesome."}
{"text":"This review is for Coach woman's shop
I wanted to buy wallet but there is no price on it so I asked staff was so rude.
so I did not buy anything.
They are just standing and chatting each other and do not help customer at all.
Never buy there again.
What a poor customer service.
She doe not know how to talk to customer!"}
{"text":"A place is only good as its bathrooms are clean. That's what I always say. If bathrooms are filth, the place is not worth patronizing. 

Every time I have been here, I will my bladder into expanding itself so I can avoid the restrooms. Today, I could not. The bathroom needed serious attention, and I left the mall shortly thereafter because I felt a film forming on my skin just by being in the place. 

The stores themselves are fine. A lot of them have student discounts (I'm still a student of my 3-years-ago alma mater, don't tell nobody) so be sure to ask if you are a student or a cheater like me."}
{"text":"Although I feel these outlets are a little on the low end, they do have a wide variety of shops.  Levis, Guess, Gap, Coach, Nike...etc......Its a pretty big mall but could use some revamping.  Lots of parking!
I do feel like the prices here are not much of a discount to the original stores."}
{"text":"The mall itself I would call 'hoopty' even my husband commented he felt like he was in a Cancun mall. Anyways what saves this place are specific stores that I personally like, like Coach, Sketchers and Claire's. Sadly I could not find my favorite sunglasses kiosk, looks like they are gone. One problem I found is the temperature. Some parts are cool but others are hot and in the dessert heat that can be troublesome. Also some of the 'outlets' are not really that cheap, you can actually find better deals at Ross or Marshall's."}
{"text":"This mall is huge.  It's been around for almost 20 yrs now and has continued to expand and add stores even through the economic downturn.  We travel to Vegas once a year in December to go to the NFR and do some Christmas shopping. This place is on our list to visit when we do.

The majority of the stores are indoor with a few outdoor stores in the parking lot.  If you plan to shop/browse the entire mall, plan on an all day shopping excursion.  It will take a while to casually go through it all.

If you get hungry, there's a food court in the center of the mall with fast food options or you can dine in some sit-down restaurants in the parking lot.

I've found some great deals at the stores here and if you catch them at the right time you'll the sales/discounts can be huge.  Be prepared for large crowds on the weekends and if you're driving here I recommend parking on the South side of the mall where I've found it to be less busy and easier to park.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Lots of stores and it was indoors! Most outlet malls are set up like a strip mall but this wasn't. Really good deals, it was clean, no real long lines and not too big or complicated that shopping seemed an overwhelming task."}
{"text":"Not too far from the Strip, it's a long stretch of an outlet with a lot of selection and different varieties of stores. Some a bit more upcaled than others. It's pretty crowded, even on weekdays. A lot of families and people from out of the country come here to find good deals. My parents found a couple. It's better to spend time at this outlet, everyone always leaves with something in hand."}
{"text":"There are basically two Premium Shopping Outlets in Las Vegas: North and South.  This South location is our favorite because it's enclosed with air conditioning and carpeting.  It also has a Food Court to take care of hunger pains and dehydration!  

If you're doing big purchases, go to Customer Service and get a free coupon book for more discounts!  Just check in on your Yelp app or show your AAA membership card! 

This shopping outlet was formerly known as Belz Outlet, or \"the one with the carousel\".  It's south of The Strip - you can see Mandalay Bay from this Outlet mall!  The layout is like a long rectangle with some add-on businesses at the front.

I usually drop off mom and auntie at the Ann Taylor end (Burlington has been replaced by Columbia), then park the car at the Vanity Fair end. I walk towards Clark's shoes and meet them around there.

Other favorite stores include Disney, Chico's, Crocs, Kipling, and Vera Bradley.  I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I used to not be a fan when this mall used to be the Las Vegas Outlet Center or even Belz (for those of us Vegas veterans). Ever since it became Premium Outlet it has gotten 10 x better. They added major stores like MK, Guess?, True Religion, and Puma. There really is no need to visit the North outlet unless you need something from Burberry, Tory Burge or Diesel, which is awesome since the parking and convince of this mall is way better. Not only that it is easier access going here for tourists and is also a safer area. This mall in general is a bit more spacious unlike the north which feels crammed. South outlet definitely has a lot going for them, I think the major down fall is the food court options but thankfully Canes, Tropical Smoothie and Chipotle are all located just outside in the front. I definitely come here for my outlet shopping, particularly since I don't regularly shop at those higher end stores."}
{"text":"This is an outlet mall. It's absolutely swarming with tourists. I find the selection of stores far superior to that of the North outlets, but at least at the North you can be outside and not crammed in with everyone. The bonus is that there are two completely separate food courts, so at least some people are spaced out. 

The major con is that there are pagodas all along the center of the walkway, and the people try to put lotions or perfumes on you, clean your shoes or curl your hair. Not my thing at all."}
{"text":"Great stores an great prices. Tbe location is great as well. Lots of food placws near by to eat as well. Going early an on weekdays is best if you dont want a packed store. All in all love the outlets."}
{"text":"This mall is conveniently located in central Las Vegas, but the type of consumers this mall attracts is nothing but tourist.  I also find myself trying to dodge the vendors in the middle aisles (mostly Persian) trying to sell me useless \"As Seen On TV\" crap.  No, I don't want to buy Botox, iPhone covers, or some other facial cream garbage, so don't ask!!!  Although, they have the Nike store and a few other cool shops, I avoid this place if I can.  The mall standards really need to get rid of the carnival squawking with the middle aisle vendors and you might get more locals!"}
{"text":"I generally avoid this place, but I had to stop at the Great American Cookie Company and this was the closest.  

Parking is worse than ever because they're doing some renovation on the entrances and there are areas that are blocked off.  

There seemed to be a lot of tourists shopping which is very good.  Keep it up, Las Vegas visitors.  

I'll only be back here when I really need to get to one of these stores - probably another three years."}
{"text":"You need to go to both north and south outlet malls.  I personally like this outlet mall more because it's not as picked over as more popular north mall and an inside mall.  The Nike store was fully stocked and this outlet has a fully stocked Under Armour store.  The food court is bigger and better here too.  Another tip is the Puma store here has a bunch of Ferrari jackets and accessories."}
{"text":"Though we originally planned to head over to the Premium Outlets, our concierge at the hotel advised us to go here instead.   I did really well at the Nike Store and the Fossil store, but my friend went gangbusters at Nike, Van Heusen, Sketchers, and Calvin Klein.   I would definitely go back, it's a good, solid outlet mall with actual discounted deals."}
{"text":"First time here! Lots of great shops. Keep in mind it's an outlet mall so don't compare to a regular mall store. It's not as nice as the outdoor outlet mall but if you need to get out of the heat for a while, there's lots to see here.

Carousel for kids and a food court. Popcorn stands-that's always a hit with my kids. Toys R Us, Disney Store, Carter's, Charlotte Russe (for cheap, trendy finds) which BTW on this trip they had $5 scarves. 

Some stores didn't offer much of a GREAT selection like BCBG or Banana Republic so I wouldn't come running back to peek into those shops.  If you're looking for kids tennis shoes they have tons of shops for a variety of selection.  

I can't believe it took me this long to get here!  I only saw half the mall but I did see Gap and Michael Kors so dudes I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas and have visited these outlet malls on multiple occasions. Every time I am more impressed! This is a true outlet mall-  every store has amazing deals! They also offer a very wide variety of different name brand stores as well. 

I would highly recommend this outlet mall to anyone looking for a great deal!"}
{"text":"This outlet mall have an abundant amount of stores. The outlet mall is open even until midnight too. These outlets are less than a mile from my house and during the day I do not enjoy shopping here since it is always busy here. Towards the evening time it thins out and a patron may maneuver the way without running into other individuals. The restaurants inside the mall are varied from Chinese to American. I enjoy having a Cinnabon and Starbucks this close to my house in a mall setting. Two of my favorite stores here are Spencer's and Hot Topic and I can find all this and more at the outlets ."}
{"text":"What I like about this location is you can escape the Vegas weather! The stores are a bit smaller and I don't find as many sales here as the North outlet. But the parking is much easier and the environment has less traffic. 
They have lots of food and unique vendors. My favorite places in the mall is Toys'R'Us when I need to shop for my nephew's!"}
{"text":"Outlet malls are a bit of a disappointment to me. There have been numerous times I have headed to the outlets after shopping at the 'normal' mall, and I've seen the exact same items from the 'normal' mall's stores sale racks at the outlet mall version of the store... This outlet mall in particular is guilty of this... 

Stores like Hot Topic, Aeropostale, Charlotte Russe and Guess are not going to land you any better deals then their locations at Galleria or Fashion Show Mall. However, the Calvin Klein, Vans and Adidas stores have been worth the trip for me in terms of finding killer deals. 

There are many overly pushy people working at kiosks that can be annoying. I have never seen anything at any of the kiosks I've even consider buying. 

The mall has been remodeled recently and it is indoors, which is a big plus when it comes to the hot summer months. The options for eating are very limited, however there are a few eateries outside the mall. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, this mall is pretty poorly laid out. It's basically a long strip mall.  There are stores that are only accessible from outside, and stores that are only accessible from the inside... I find that highly annoying.  

If the weather permits, I absolutely suggest heading to Las Vegas Premium Outlets - North. The layout is better, there are fewer pushy kiosk vendors, and better deals to be found."}
{"text":"There were quite a few stores at this Premium Outlets, but I found the Las Vegas Premium Outlets - North had better stores.  The good thing was that this outlet is close to the hotels on the strip so the taxi fare will only be about $15-18.

The sales were good, but you really had to scan the racks."}
{"text":"It looks tiny from the front door but it's pretty big once you're inside. Huge selection of stores. Be sure that you're actually in an outlet store before purchasing. Many of the stores are just normal retail stores and don't offer much in the way of discounts.

The food court is quite small, I just figured there would be more of a selection. There was construction going on during my visit and they did a great job of keeping things nice and neat."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience overall. This mall tops my \"never again list.\" Confused and obnoxious tourists everywhere. You walk through the mall and get pestered by carny-like kids selling yo-yos and back hair removers."}
{"text":"I love this mall, they have everything and I can get in and out quickly. 

It gets VERY busy on the weekend so I highly suggest going early Saturday morning to catch the best sales and least amount of traffic."}
{"text":"Not much of an outlet type pricing all the stores seem to be a regular mall price with maybe 20% saving and if your lucky 40%.  I only came here for the Michael Kors outlet which was very crowded.  The only sale they had were the clearance purses that nobody wanted & trying to get rid of.  If you want a cute purse you are paying full price.  The people working there are a little pushy and will only offer you a 20% discount if you buy an accessory.  I was not at all impressed with this outlet mall.  Sorry I wasted the $26 plus tip taxi cab ride to this place."}
{"text":"There is a great selection of stores here. It is inside, which can make it incredibly crowded. There are two food court sections. It smells delicious every time you walk by Auntie Anne's or Cinnabon. There are some stores on the outside in the front. You can't access them from inside the main mall, so make sure you check those out. There's plenty of rest rooms and snack/soda machines if you're not wanting something big to eat. Tons of parking and a taxi stand right out front in the middle section of the mall. There are plenty of other restaurants right in front of the mall. This is a great place for locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Awesome mall! The customer service folks were super helpful in getting me the discount after I supported Susan G. Komen. It was clean, too. Didn't realize how big it was until I walked my mom around, using her walker. It was too much for her and it didn't help that I went the wrong way, trying to return to the garage."}
{"text":"Always buy my clothes from here when in Vegas. Can't go wrong, lots of choices. Seasonal stuff, so choices will change. Prices a reasonably cheap, but sales tax is 8.25%.  So do the math to see if you are getting a good price versus back home."}
{"text":"It is an ok outlet mall. It has gotten much better over the past few years with their interior and outer remodel.  The stores have improved as well. There used to only be 2 stores I liked there, but now there are dozens I enjoy. 

If you do go, stop by the customer service desk in the food court to pick up a coupon book. They are free if you have an AAA or AARP membership card. Otherwise I think they are $5, but usually worth it.  The staff will let you look at it first to see if the stores you want are in the book."}
{"text":"Choices, choices, choices. Which outlet to visit, which stores to see and what to buy? Especially the latter considering the weight limit most airlines have set. Too bad. Because compared to the Netherlands most (brand) clothes are very cheap. Something to do with your outlets and the currency convertion. But what I like most is that buying something here makes me have something special. The change that anyone else in the office wears the same dress is small (although it happend to me once).

Big note: probably people don't believe it, but I hate shopping. That's why I love the American outlets. One day, twice a year, sneakers and a little endurance and I'm ready for the next season. Everything conveniently located together. And after all those years I exactly know which brands to visit and what sizes to buy. Even without fitting.

In the past years this location looks upgraded. More and more nice stores (Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren) have arrived and they expanded with stores on the outside. Most stores are on the inside (airconditioned!). Not a very attractive environment, but it does the job. And if you're prepared to have a little stroll you can park your car behind the building where there's shade throughout the day. Compared to the north you'll probably find 70-80% the same stores on this location. The other 20-30% are less high end than in the north. Prices between locations may vary to both sides.

Two things I don't like. One is all the people in the middle trying to get your attention to sell you 'as steen on television' stuff. Get a life, stop harassing me. The other is the food court. Nothing fresh. But then again, it's an outlet, not a fine dining location. Although just a soda vending machine would be such an improvement. Shopping makes thirsty.

And excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to shop. This outlet store has many places to shop from Disney to Hanes to Claire's to Nike. It has many brands and stores for you to choose from. They also have several food courts and their are also restaurants and shops that surround the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Love shopping here when I'm in town. I always find deals!!! I say the earlier you arrive the better if you want a decent parking spot."}
{"text":"Great place to go shopping and looking for some great deals.  They have a lot of good stores and service is great!  Purchased a lot of good quality clothes at a fraction of the regular price."}
{"text":"Formerly Known as Belz Outlet Mall, The Premium Outlets-South is what I Consider to be A Major Tourist Hotspot for Shopping...

Since the Name Change, they have Added a lot more Shops..and I believe there are 3 Food Courts! 

Just a Word of Caution, Beware of those Center Kiosks that Try to lure You into Buying those Deep Sea Lotions, the Compact Steamer, or that Purple Jewelry Cleaner ( which does work, lol). They will Do Anything to Make you stop and buy something from them! 

Parking can be a Huge Problem, but with some Patience...You can find one!  
And, if You don't like what they have in their Food Court, across the Parking Lots are a Bevy of Eateries like Panda Express, Raising Cane's, Five Brother's Burgers & Fries, IHOP! 

You Will Love what this Mall has to Offer...I Never got Disappointed whenever I go there!!

Definite Must for Locals & Tourists Alike! :)"}
{"text":"It's a really great place from what you can expect from an OUTLET. Compared to some other outlets and malls I have seen (and I have seen ugly ones), it is pretty decent. If you want to save money, you can't really be picky about how the place looks. Sales are pretty good, especially around the holidays. This place should get better reviews than it has."}
{"text":"This used to be the old Belz Factory Outlets, but will always be Belz to this guy:o) Funny how whenever I finish going on a long run, I find myself in here and walking around. Haha. TONS of stores like Bose, Adidas, Nike, Skechers, Hurley, Quiksilver and the list goes on. There's like five different perfume/cologne stores as well so you'll always smell good:o) On a hot summer day, it's always cool to be in here and check out the latest sales because there's always plenty. Definitely will keep coming back"}
{"text":"In TX we have two huge outlet malls next to each other in San Marcos.  One has all the stores you want to go visit, while the other one has ones you just go to because they are there.  Well the South Location is just that \"other\" location.  If you have time, you can visit both, but if you can only visit one, visit the north side one."}
{"text":"Didn't like it when it was Belz and dont' care for it now, but my mom likes corning ware and her kitchen stuff, so we do that here. Two different food courts. Get samples."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Belz. The newly instituted renovations include: combo carpet/floor inside (don't like this much), larger stores outside front and center, facing Las Vegas Boulevard- Fossil (this one has clothing), Coach, Anne Taylor Loft (yes!!! i love this store), Reebok, Rockport, True Religion, Under Armour, Gap, Michael Kors, and many others- this particular section is very nice (there are numerous benches with canopies to take a break). 

This indoor outlet mall has two food courts (bathrooms inside), a carousel, a customer service desk (get your discount booklet here), and bathrooms in the middle, as well.  The large Nike outlet store (excellent selection of shoes) is on the same side as Burlington Brands (cheap basics for men and women). On the other side, opposite, is the Vanity Fair outlet store (great for undies and bras). All the beach/surf brands are inside too, like Hurley, PacSun, RipCurl, Quiksilver, Billabong (love this store), Element, O'Neill,  & Volcom. A few other stores are worth looking at here too, like Windsor & Esprit (few stores in town). 

The aisles are packed with kiosks (those multi-wrap dresses, the massage group, the flat irons, the fake hair pieces, the miche bags)- get ready for the swapmeet hustle here, folks. During Christmas time, it's awfully hard to walk through here, when there are particularly lots of shoppers. I would suggest coming here pretty early or pretty late during the holidays. 

We go to Premium/North (open-air) quite a bit and on a regular basis, and find lots more deals there, especially at our favorite stores (Fossil/Quiksilver/Banana Republic/Disney/Harry & David just to mention a few stores). So of course, this mall edges out Premium/South. 

Overall, this is a clean mall, with regular maintenance being done (i see cleaning people all the time). I didn't notice any security guards the last few times we came here. There is ample parking space available. The best spots to park are in front of Burlington Brands and the VF outlet store (opposite ends). Also, there is more shopping and restaurants (Chipotle, Samurai Sam's, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, Chili's, and so many others) at two other sections (not attached to the mall). Our most recent visit was two days ago (and we went here the previous week, to check out the shoes at Nike). I'm anticipating the new Banana Republic store's opening November 1st."}
{"text":"We decided between North and South and went with South after looking at the listing.  It's pretty easy to get to rather than deal with downtown.  Also, shops look more affordable than your Gucci and other high end stores.  The place looked pretty decent.  I found the Ralph Lauren Polo store and Brooks Brothers to have really nice deals for Memorial Day.  My mom found a belt at the Banana Republic.  We tried looking for an Eddie Bauer but no luck here.  Interesting stores here with Volcon and other brands which I haven't seen.  It takes a while to walk from one end to another.  Other stores on outside hard to access in this indoor mall.  But, at least it's all indoors and you don't have to battle weather, etc.  

There is an Annex to this outlet which has Disney stuff for real cheap, Saks Off the 5th, and some other local stores.  Other stores are wicked expensive for usual touristy stuff like ponchos and leather goods.  There is a random apparel store with heavily discounted Disney and hats with no logos and T-shirts with some random stuff on it.  I think the store owner got these shirts and stuff for dirt cheap and now off-loading for less than $10."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is at the bottom of the strip, near the rental car center. It used to be called Belz Outlets if I remember correctly. This outlet is ok. It is indoor and has a lot of stores to look at. They even have an Aeropostale and Dickies outlet. They may have a lot of stores, but only a few that I actually browse in. I do like the other outlet mall near downtown more since they have more stores and more stores that i personally shop in. 

This place does have a food court. 

All in all, if you are definitely looking for discounts and/or something in particular, check this place out. If you are on a trip and only have time to hit one outlet mall, I don't suggest it be this one. 

^_^*~"}
{"text":"This outlet has come a long way from what I remember it to be from the 90s and even compared to when I first moved to Vegas. They have better stores now (as far as what my family and I are interested in) they've added: Polo Ralph Lauren, Lucky Brand, Coach, Original Adidas Store, Nine West INSIDE the mall itself so that I don't have to toture myself having to walk all the way over to the other one in the freaking heat.

Lately the selection has been a lot better at this outlet than the one on Charleston. But the best part about this outlet is that it's INDOORS! I mean, I love to shop, but that 110 degree weather in the summer is enough to slow my butt down and stop spending money... Maybe that's a good thing?

Another comparison that I noticed with this outlet to the one on Charleston is that there are. Plenty of places to eat. Granted, they may not be well known vendors nor may they be that good but at least when you need to refuel, you have different parts of the mall that you're able to sit down and get your grub on. There happens to be a few well known fast food and sit down restaurants outside of the mall: Raising Canes, Chili's, etc. 

This outlet and the one out at Primm are my favorites.

The End."}
{"text":"So this is my favorite indoor  place to shop in town! I also LOVE town square and Downtown Summerlin, but you can not go wrong with the bargains you're able to find at the Premium Outlet south. I feel like this location is less appreciated than the north one, and if anything it should be vice versa! 
Here's why: 

First, you can come in at any weather type. This is serious - if you live in town or visit here often, you'd know that it becomes borderline IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the house in summer, unless you go underwater! Same for the tough months of December and January, especially when it's super windy. 
Second, they have hidden gems that are exclusive in town, like the Karl Lagerfeld store, a Gymboree outlet store for kids and the coolest toy store I've seen (FunZone Vegas, I've uploaded some photos). 
Third, it's almost never too crowded! Other than Black Friday or thanksgiving weekend, I feel like this one stop shop is great whenever it's too hot or too cold to stay out. Plus I always find the cutest shoes, clothes and gifts here."}
{"text":"Nice, large mall with a great selection.  Some prices are definitely not at outlet prices, so buyer beware! Check Retail Me Not for additional coupon savings! Most of the employees left much to be desired and I  had to question whether or not they actually had a pulse.  Maria at Stride Rite was AWESOME though! Wonderful customer service!  Kiosk employees are pushy and weird. One kiosk employee selling creams, actually stepped in front of my daughter so she could not pass by.  Another kiosk employee selling shoe cleaner wanted to clean my daughter's flip flops.  Frankly, I think he had a foot fetish! The worst employees were the janitorial staff.  Very rude, flirting with customers, swearing, etc.  But I guess that you can only find half witted gang members to work minimum wage."}
{"text":"I just do not like this outlet should not even be called an outlet. Not that many stores, and compared to the other outlets near and around Vegas, I would say pass on this small one and visit the others for sure!
Just a shopping tip from an infamous shopper :)"}
{"text":"It's a mall. Don't expect whopping discounts, they are hard to find. Lots of foreigners who will run you over in a second. Walk at your own risk especially at the holidays."}
{"text":"They have a lot of stores that you can shop in but they didn't seem to have crazy sales or deals. There was only a few stores that I felt worth shopping at. It's in doors so you won't be burning hot while you shop!!!"}
{"text":"One of our stops to placate the wife whenever we go to Vegas, it's right down the street from the rental car facility in Las Vegas. It's part of the Premium Outlet concept and has several national chains like Coach, Cole Haan, Nike, Adidas, Ann Taylor, Polo Ralph Lauren, etc.

Parking is super easy with drive up parking surrounding the entire mall. The mall is basically one long corridor, with a few small wings. If you check into the center with Yelp, you also get a small coupon book (leaflet) with various discounts throughout the mall.

Prices seem fair , but be forewarned, that as like with most outlet centers, lower quality good may be manufactured specifically for that brands outlet stores."}
{"text":"Despite the 3 star rating, there are many stores in the south outlet which you won't find in the north outlet. Quite frankly, the south outlet I also prefer for the sake of the fact it's an actual interior mall, so there's A/C during the summer heat which Las Vegas experiences like 10 months a year.

Outside all that, however, north outlet has more store variety. I believe south has 140 stores, while north has 150...but it feels like north has a lot more to offer. Nonetheless, some major stores north doesn't have include New Balance, Aerosoles, Naturalizer...oh and south has a significantly better food court than north.

I also don't like the design too much...since it's essentially a giant line from one end to another instead of a circle design that most malls have...it actually takes a long time to walk from one end to another and then walk back.

While I suppose many drive to this outlet mall, it is also easily accessible by transit from The Strip, with a stop in front of the mall parking lot."}
{"text":"I like this mall as it's indoors and is clean. My biggest complaint is that I can only ever find one bathroom and it's at one end of the mall. It's not well marked either. If you don't happen to go down that area you'll never find it. Otherwise I really like this mall. It has better prices than the north mall too and is convenient to the airport."}
{"text":"This outlet is the true meaning of outlet. Junk that can't sell that no one wants. I did, however, find a cheap pair of Adidas sneakers ($26) though. I mean if Wet Seal is still in business selling 12-year-old sized clothes at buy one, get one free, you need to RUN the other direction... OUTLET."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is not as classy or swanky as its Northern Brother. But does that stop it from having a Brooks Brothers or  Ralph Lauren? Nope they are proudly there, across the hall from each other. Overall this place has all the things an outlet mall should have; Soft Pretzels/A Food Court/ Great Buys/ Foxy Israeli Women selling Dead Sea Products (That's for those of you who don't care about soft pretzels). Plus it is indoors, so it is great for those rainy days or for when the temperature gets above 100. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a lot of stores clean and all inside didn't get to really walk through everything but there seemed to be some good sales. 
Got a great deal on some baby clothes from carriers and a really nice maternity bathing suit from motherhood."}
{"text":"For the Bilabong Store- friendly helpful people, awesome prices, and Daisy rocks! Where's undercover boss? She is happy to be at work and makes people feel good. She embodies bilabong culture."}
{"text":"The mall itself has to take a hit for this one because the small custom tshirt shop called \"custom kings LV\" doesn't have a yelp.

I had gotten two shirts. $168. The break down being $35 and $20 for the actual shirts. $25 each for the custom designs. THEN, what's not listed is a $25 fee for putting the design on. The one girl told me my second design would be $3 which is the only reason I got a second one. But they don't tell you anything about a $25 fee to put the design on.
So now it's $168 right?? I told the owner that they should explain that. That's not right that they don't tell you that. Also, not honoring what I was told, that my 2nd design would be $3. I swear I rarely ever complain but when I got back to my car- I noticed that the shirts felt like absolute shit. Pure paper. On a shirt. And the designs weren't even straight. I figured with smaller businesses they would want to make sure they made things right with me, but they clearly don't. Please don't go here, anyone. I can't even give the shirt as a gift it's such shitty quality.


Update: the mall did try to reminisce the situation. I just still want to warn everyone to NOT GO TO THIS STAND. They will rip you off. The owner is Israel Hayot and he's a complete smartass.

They use wax paper!! Which you can get at walmart for $10 and iron it on yourself. The quality is not worth the money."}
{"text":"This shopping center has a pretty good store lineup and there are usually some good deals to be found.

Having been to outlet malls in other cities I can say this location is better than most outlets. The location is about 10 minutes from the Strip instead of in the middle of nowhere. It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15. 

There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.

Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.

This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.

The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)"}
{"text":"Bright shiny colors everywhere but not a good deal anywhere.  I found this to be a serious tourist trap and a bit of a waste of time, but the lady I was with found a couple of things she was happy with.  Standard mall food court."}
{"text":"Honestly my least favorite shopping area in all of Las Vegas. The North Premium Outlets, although much much further from me, is much much better. The South outlet went through renovations 2-3 years ago and it still looks sad and dated. I never look forward to coming here and only do because of convenience. I don't think there's anything \"Premium\" about this location at all, whereas with the North ones you can literally spend an entire day hopping through each store.

The store selection here isn't as great as the other location but you can occasionally find some good deals on the stores that *are* here. The stores here also have less selection at times even though they have the same exact store at the other outlet (for example, Coach is much bigger at North outlets!). Some positive things about this is that it is close to the south end of the strip if you're staying there and it is also close to quite a few dining options (Black Bear Diner, Cane's, BWW) and also a short driving distance to Town Square which has a theatre, more shopping, and more dining options.

Lastly, this place is indoors, thus making this a nice choice in the summer when it hits 110. But you have been warned... the inside is dreary no matter the time of year."}
{"text":"I came here to shop during Labor day weekend during afternoon and the place was crowded.  First, it was hard to find parking and we had to park on the side of the outlet.  Second, the place was busy with lots of shoppers. There are plenty of shops outside and inside but I was looking for big dog store.  As I was walking around, I've noticed Harry and David closed and Big Dog store closed too.  I was so disappointed that both of my favorite stores closed down so I headed back to the car.  There were plenty of deals at some of the stores so I didn't feel like buying anything."}
{"text":"The Premium Outlets are huge I think they span a mile long and if you're not careful you can end up spending an entire afternoon shopping and an entire paycheck. The discount stores range from the Nike store they have a fox store Wilsons Leather store Ralph Lauren Adidas, tons of luggage stores, perfume stores and more. I would do a little bit of research and figure out which stores you want to go to and park closest to them since it is so long you can get kind of turned around in the whole place. They have a food court in the middle of everything that has Orange Julius those are my favorite and I love them! A word to the wise if you come on the weekend it's going to be slammed and unless you want to get sold something from the people at the kiosks keep on moving and avoid eye contact :-)"}
{"text":"I haven't checked out the other outlet mall in Vegas, but compared to all the other outlet malls I've been to - this is one of the best.  LOVE that it is mostly indoor - although you do have to brave the heat for a few stores that are outside the many wings of the mall.  Otherwise, it's one big line of stores with great deals!  Didn't try any food at the food court(s), but there are more options than at most Premium outlets we've been to.

All in all, a successful and satisfying shopping trip!"}
{"text":"Stores that I wanted to shop was not there . Although when I went on a black friday only few people are shopping which I Really like so no hassle in line and I have my space . I bought a shoes in New Balance and they have 40% off entire store plus $10.00 off for the first 100 customer and I am 49th. The employees were very attentive and helpful . And i ask why it seems not busy and its black friday , and they told me that there's another outlet  called las Vegas north premium outlet and more people are going there instead . Maybe  when I Go to Vegas again I surely will be back in this outlet because its not crowded ."}
{"text":"It looks like the Las Vegas Outlet underwent a \"She's All That\" makeover, it even threw away it's former name to have Premium attached to it. Improved exterior design but still retains it's sorta trashy and hollow (but much improved) interior. 

Added store infrastructure and shade on the front upgrade this strip mall from looking like North Las Vegas. It helps that they fronted Michael Kors ,True Religion, and Coach smack dab for everyone to see.  Smart move. Nothing says premium like Coach (jk!) . My biggest compliment has to be the much improved bathrooms. No longer cursed with fluorescent lighting, small space, lack of hand soap, and graffiti! Instead you have soft lighting, black furnishing, new toilets, and a cool hand drying machine. Much of the layout is still the same with all your familiar stores. South-end of the outlet is depressing with kiosks selling useless knick-knacks and LV tees and empty stores. Regardless, the developers and project managers have taken the right steps forward into improving this shit hole. It's a frugal alternative if your wallet cries at Town Square a few blocks north."}
{"text":"Das jetzige Premium Outlet Center, früher mal Belz Factory Outlet, ist leider eine Enttäuschung. Die Auswahl der Geschäfte ist begrenzt und das Ambiente hat sehr stark gelitten im Vergleich zu meinen früheren Erfahrungen hier. Ich nehme an, der inzwischen starke Konkurrenzdruck, durch das Entstehen diverser anderer und modernerer Outlet Malls hier in Las Vegas hat dazu geführt, dass nicht mehr alle Marken hier vertreten sind. Die Preise sind durchschnittlich, das Angebot eher mäßig nach meinem Empfinden, extreme Schnäppchen sind mir nicht ins Auge gefallen, die Ware scheint oftmals B Ware oder Übetbestand aus der letzen Saison zu sein, was für ein solches Outlet auch in Ordnung geht. Der Foodcourt, wovon es zwei gibt, hat die Atmosphäre einer Bahnhofshalle. Wer wenig Zeit hat, sollte sich lieber eines der neueren Outletcenter suchen für seinen oder ihren Konsumrausch."}
{"text":"Most is indoors so good for the hot days. Layout makes the place a little crowded, but has regular selection of \"outlet\" shops."}
{"text":"I always find something when I come here. Well stocked and has a good mix of high end and regular stores. During the warmer weather the have misters so you won't die in the heat. I like going to Godiva for ice cream..."}
{"text":"I wish this had more walking space. I hate feeling crowded and moving for everyone walking by. The stores are decent. I only really checked out NIKE and new balance(which sucks for selection)

I'd say worth the trip if you like other stores, theres other places to shop in vegas."}
{"text":"This outlet mall has gone downhill. They did some upgrades to the outer exterior to have the apply of better outlet stores such as Michael Kors, Coach, Guess, etc., but indoors has a bit of swapmeet feel. Maybe that's too extreme but it's what it feels like to me.

There are so many kiosks down the middle of the mall always bugging you.

So many stores going out of business.

There is one good thing which is the passport. Check into the outlet mall and you get a coupon passport to use."}
{"text":"Very good sales on mother's day sales week. Plus even more sales with our Vip booklet and other printable coupons. Info kiosk sells vip booklet for $5 or print the free vip booklet coupon on their website to get it for free. I prefer north, but this one is good too."}
{"text":"The South Premium outlets are very fun to shop around in and have such a vast variety of shops!! Shops here include: Michael Kors ( which is my favorite!), US Polo Assn. , Coach, toys r us, Levi, Claire's , Men's Warehouse, etc..it's a great experience to talk to eveyone at the kiosks and folks who work in the shops! Prices are great as well! The food court is perfect...it has subway and burger King!! I always love getting a gorgeous handbag for myself at Michael kors then eating a delicious meal at Burger King! Great place to bring the whole family and to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Old, tired, dark...but close to the airport.  The South Premium Outlets reminds me of the older, indoor malls in Buffalo with lotsa kiosks in the middle of the hall.

Again, as with any mall, check out the directory of the stores before you head out there.  Stores sounded promising, but when I actually got there, it's just soo dim inside, it threw me off.

I literally went into 1 store and that was it for me.  No real deals there."}
{"text":"Close to my house so this is the mall I always go to.. good name stores.. just busy and they nees more walking room it gets congested.. maybe get rid of some of the pesky middle sale carts.. ;) always trying stop you to show you crap.. lol over all clean easy access and lots of parking"}
{"text":"It was an ok shopping experience nothing really exciting the deals where good went into a lot of store coach, Armani exchange, express etc.. Got a button up at Express but wasn't too into it, food court seems good bathrooms had 3 stalls and yeah other stuff idk I'd say if you're looking for a certain store come here but if you're looking for a shopping experience don't come here"}
{"text":"We like this outlet because it's indoors. It gets crowded, but we came early to find good parking. Not a whole bunch of sale after the Memorial Day holiday, but was able to score good boots from Bass for a really cheap price! It's pretty big end to end, so make sure to take a picture of the map. Restrooms are clean and you get $5 if you check in in Yelp!"}
{"text":"This is the older of the 2 outlets and it ss more conveniently located for those staying on the Strip, but we find the north outlets to be nicer.  There is lots of parking, but no garage so during the hotter months you have to park in the sun.  Stores are stretched out over a greater distance requiring more walking to get to the few outlets of interest.  We prefer to the north outlets, but occasionally visit these outlets."}
{"text":"The only reason I come to the South location, is that it is indoors lol

i find the selection is better at the North...
not to put the South location down, there are some great stores here, and deals to be had...but i do my Boxing Day shopping at the North location. South is a good way to burn a few hours during the heat of the day..."}
{"text":"I took my relatives here yesterday afternoon after they had been out since 10am at other shopping places, including the Forum shops, Miracle Mile, Town Center, and the other premium outlets at Grand Central Parkway. Wow, just reading that last sentence tires me severely, a very blatant example of mall-name-drop histrionics. But yes, a little backgrounder. Whenever my kin come in, it's like a plague of consumer locusts descending upon Lake Commodity. The males stay in the casino while the females conquer...I once called my auntie Jess \"Jesus.\" When she asked me why, I said it's because Uncle always has to throw dice for your clothes. She laughed and caught herself just in time to tell me that I was destined to be a stand-up comedian. In Hell, where people ball up their feces and have impeccable aim.

Anyways, Nuestra Familia had the Shopping offensive playbook synced on their blackberries and iphones, and I was but the hapless driver. As always, conversation turned to how quickly Vegas was developing and the increasing traffic. Being that I'm from SoCal and they NY, I had to do the smile-and-nod routine. The 405 isn't a freeway: it's \"parking in groups\", right? When we get there after showing off my quick-n-nimble construction-navigation skillz, I asked what more could you possibly find here, there's already too much junk in my trunk? Who else could you possibly buy a \"Vegas = Tranny? I'd hit it!\" shirt for? But they were Determined.  

I hung out on the benches across from the nondescript food court, texting and checking email while feeling bad for the kids trying to make the mechanical ducks and old-skool coin-op rides actually work. An hour passes by, then another. I'm starting to get hungry. Wtf? Where are they? Is it really THAT interesting? Then my nephew pops out of the Famous Footwear store with two boxes of fresh kicks and the biggest smile on his face. He calls my aunts and cousins, and they meet up with us next to a kiosk (I made eye contact!!!! Noooooo!!!!) vendor. 

Everyone's happy. When everyone's happy, I'm happy. 
Oh yeah, I scored insoles. How Exciting, oh my gawd!

Hence the four stars.
Let's just please not do this again for another year, k?"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this place an outlet - more like a mall with a variety of boutiques and very few actual outlet stores (ex. Michael Kors, Coach). 

As far as I can see, the prices of the boutiques are normal pricing, nothing \"outlet\" about it. It's just like going to Main Place or Westminster Mall (if you're from OC you would know)... how much cheaper can Charlotte Russe get right??? You can find better quality and deals at Nordstrom Rack.

I go here if I forgot to pack some things; not to shop."}
{"text":"Yea...so uhm if you're into that hippity hop music or looking for dredge...this is the place to be. Eh...but definitely not my style. Once in a while at a random day in a blue moon I walk in here and find absolutely...NOTHING. Then again. I may be just to posh for this place."}
{"text":"***TIP***
Lots of congestion (pedestrians, taxi cabs, vehicles) in the front of the mall, so park on the ends, or drive around BACK to get to the other side.

***PROS***
* Disney Outlet  and Toys R Us Outlet!!!
* Plenty of parking
* Clean mall, smells like buttery popcorn

***CONS***
Needs more signage. No sign showing which end of the mall Disney and Toys R Us are located."}
{"text":"I love these outlets. Randy took me here for my birthday and bought me a new purse for my birthday. My other one was stolen a couple of months ago. I didnt know why we were here, but i started crying when he presented it to me. With all my stress the beginning of the.year and Irs drama, hes been my angel."}
{"text":"Lots of stores, lots of choices.
From luggage, to Brooks Brothers, to underwear, you can find it here.
Good mix of stores, from higher end brands, to random stores.

Parking is good, and plentiful."}
{"text":"It's alright got a few things. Mainly shoes-best shoes discount stores here."}
{"text":"Usually when I'm driving home from Vegas and traffic is backed up, I (like most people) pull over and go shopping. This time I had kids with me in Vegas, so naturally, I had Back to School shopping on my mind. So the day before we left, I hit up Las Vegas Premium Outlets. I outfitted the kids in the cutest outfits for 60-80% off. It may seem weird to have the kids trying on hoodies in 103 degree weather, but for 10 bucks it was worth the \"Mom, you are crazy\" look. We only covered half of the mall in 2 hours, but had a trunk full, so I considered it a success. I have 2 big problems with this mall, #1 the food courts are filled with crap choices. I'm sorry, but I'm not buying my kids sugar filled drinks, fried foods and lame excuses for \"desserts\". they basically sell carnival food. #2 A lot of the best stores only have access from the outer edge of the mall, which means no matter what the obscene weather, you have to brace yourself and walk around out there. Yuck."}
{"text":"This is yet another Premium Outlet, from the same chain that have malls all over the country. It has all the big brands like Adidas, Calvin Klein, Columbia, Gap, Guess, Levis, Nike, etc. The place has a good size, it is not too big like other outlet malls, so walking around is more of a pleasant stroll as opposed to a grueling endurance marathon. 

Also, unlike most outlet malls, including the Las Vegas North, this place is an enclosed mall with AC, which is nice, since you are in the middle of the desert. I believe this place is slightly closer to the Strip than the north one."}
{"text":"Very dated shopping mall.  The signs and many of the stores look like them stepped out of the late 80s.  But there are some modern additions like a fancy Nike store.

I am sad to say that my credit card history now has a Hot Topic charge on it.  Found a great deal on a gift for my niece in the \"half off lowest clearance price\" rack.  But otherwise, the prices were the same as any other Hot Topic store.

I didn't see any really deep discounts in the stores I visited.  I stopped in because I need a few more pairs of socks for my trip.  I walked around to see if anything was worth visiting, but instead I just hopped back on the bus back to my hotel."}
{"text":"The only reason they got 2 stars is because of the few stores that I go to here. I always find a sale or a deal that I wasn't expecting. As for everything else, it's just not good. 

I do not like to go to places that make me feel like a foreigner in my own town. If you pay close attention, all the people around you are speaking another language. The kiosk people basically stalk you and there's always the off chance you will run into a belligerent crackhead screaming in the hallway. This describes my recent experience....

As we were walking toward the kitchen store, we heard a commotion that ended up being a dude that had legit lost his mind. He was yelling at a guy who he didn't know about being touched inappropriately. Somehow his shirt ended up being taken off and the dude was raging mad and pacing back and forth yelling and screaming. I was nervous except that he had so little clothing on that I could tell he had no gun. His body was covered with pock marks and he took his belt off saying that someone was doing heroin behind the dumpsters and he found that belt back there to prove it. After drawing a crowd and a few people recording the fiasco on their iphones, Metro came and carted him away. I wouldn't doubt it being on youtube.com in the near future. 

Locals: avoid if possible, and if you do come here, try not to make a day out of it. Get in, and get out!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. There are lots of good stores, but this isnt the fancy outlet center. There are no fancy stores here at all. This outlet center is for the average shopper. this is the place you go when you need to buy tennis shoes, athletic wear or everyday wear. I've purchased shoes @ Nike, at Famous Footwear (the one where you earn points, etc) They have Reebok, Nike and 2 adidas stores. Nike at least has crappy socks for you to try on shoes b/c lets face it, this is the dessert, odds are we are wearing sandals. Adidas and reebok dont have this unless you specificaly ask for a pair of socks. 

They also have the great kitchen stuff store. I LOVE this store.You always find neat things in here that you didn't even know existed.. and you think to yourself wow, that's something that I need...I've always avoided, this or that b/c I didnt like this or that - but now that I have this gadget, wow I'm going to start eating healthier. Tools that have changed my life:

The apple core-er. Wow. Love it. Got mine for $5 @wal-mart but still..
The orange cutter. wow. Its like a ring you roll over the orange and it cuts the peel off into perfect slices. wow. all I can say.

The ultimate discovery- that i've actually been searching for - forever.. Even Williams Sonoma doesnt carry. The TUNA strainer!. OMG. I finally found it and it even had a magnet on the back to take out the metal lid. Dang, that's exactly why I dont eat tuna b/c I dont like to strain the can, it goes everywhere, and I dont want to pay 2-3 the $ of the can to buy the pouch pre-drained. and that one is usually very dry. This is perfect. 
One day I went out here and found it and got in line, guess what? left my card in a book bag from buying books @ CSN earlier that day

So I went back... guess what? Sold out. arrrghh... 


The only thing I hate is the parking. trying to get in and out of here is annoying. But they have tons of restaurants inside the mall - they have 2 food courts, but they also have a strip of restaurants outside too. Everything u want from Chipotle, MCDonald's, Dickey's BBQ, BWW, La cocina, Outback, dunkin donuts, Weinerschnitzel, did i spell that right?

Now the worst part of this place, which is why they lost another star is the kiosk people. If I dont want to buy anything, I dont want to buy anything. If I dont' stop @ your kiosk, that's b/c I don't have any interest in buying anything from you. Please don't try to hand me free things or put a stupid sticker or stamp on my already done nails (that I do myself for free, thanks). 
 I feel sorry for these folks b/c I know they are only doing their job but... dang. its a lose lose. you dont have this problem when you go the outlets up north - by downtown, and there you will find fancier stores. PACKED @ XMAS. wow. LINES OUT THE DOOR!. 

MY FAV stores here however are:
Nike, Adidas, Famouse Footwear bc/ they sell all diff. shoes and you can earn points toward $10-$15. off. Coach, (those girls are pushy though.. you need't tell me how much everything costs when I pick it up) Guess, VF (for undergarments, Maidenform, and Bally. bras for $15!. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I have been to these outlets ever since they were called Belz and as a matter of fact I still call them that to this day. But anyways onto what I think about this outlet mall. First of all, I have seen it grow into a pretty diverse compilation of stores over the years. It really does have a variety of shops to choose from and if your looking for something the chances are good that you'll find it here.

There are a few cons about this outlet mall though. What bothers me the most is that it always seems that I have horrible internet connection while inside. I wish someday they could correct this or at least provide a free wifi service inside this outlet like a lot of places do these days. Also, I hope someday they can provide a better selection of eateries inside the food courts. I don't remember the last time I even got anything to eat inside and I've been here plenty of times. We opt just to eat right outside the outlets as there are plenty of better options including restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is monstrous.  Reminded me of the Camarillo Outlets in California. This is a great outlet mall.  Yes, the typical stores.  But so many more that you can definitely find bargains.  I went to the Van Heusen store and got me a couple of pairs of very nice shorts for the summer for 1/3 the price of the shorts at Nike.  Yes, both are nice and Nike makes a great product, but so does Van Heusen.

I went during a weekday and it wasn't too crowded.  I guess if I went on a weekend it would be packed.  If you haven't been here, or been here in a while, check it out.  Good stuff here."}
{"text":"This place was never a good mall to begin with, and with Music 4 Less and Flashbacks closing down, it has been dealt even more fatal blows.

Pretty much all that is left in this place now is clothing stores. Yes, i know that's probably why most of you come to this place in the first place, but those of us who desire something more out of our mall experience will be sorely disappointed. 

The layout of the mall is very strange as well. It is a \"comb\" shape, basically a straight line with extensions to the exits. It gets annoying having to divert from the central hall just to go down each of the \"teeth\" to see what is there. And why does the place have TWO FOOD COURTS? This is a really strange move, they would have been better off having just one big one, and a nice, two-story layout that took up less space. 

The parking lot here is a zoo as well. Apparently, this is a popular tourist attraction (I can confirm that having worked in one of the stores some years back.) You're not going to have an easy time finding a close space. My advice - if you come, park outside Burlington's on the north end, there seem to be more spaces there than you might think, and apparently not many people think to park there.

If you're in the area and want to do some clothing shopping (and not much else), stop on in. But don't go out of your way to visit this place by any means."}
{"text":"Just south of Mandalay Bay and away from the busy Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas South Premium Outlets delivers significant discounts on popular brands. Shoppers of all ages will find deals for everyone.

Few of many are Neiman Marcus Last Call and Williams Sonoma Outlet. Both stores carry items that were actually in the original stores and not made specifically for the outlets. 

Jerky outlet a plus, but was dissatisfied as they don't seem to offer any discounted prices. Found that to be true with other shops within this mall. 

However, went into Foot Locker & happened upon a clearance pair of Under Amour shoes which were marked down & then half off that price. \" what a steal\"!   

The Las Vegas South Premium Outlets offer plenty of food court options too!

BTW: there is a NORTH & South Premium  Outlet in Vegas. South is indoors and air conditioned where the other is outdoors. They have many similar stores in which case check around & shop to see which location has the better deals on the day you go!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the only thing that REALLY kills the great shopping experience that you could have here is the numerous kiosks lined up in the middle with obnoxious sales people coming up in your face, trying to find a way for you to come and buy their overpriced product. Normally there's enough space for you to keep your distance and avoid them if you're not interested but there isn't enough space since their kiosk is right in the middle of the already narrow walkway. 
In addition to that, my little sister was persuaded to try getting her eyebrows threaded by one of the kiosks and the girl was telling us how she had years of experience and what not. My little sister said the lady's technique was ten times more painful than her first experience with threading and her eye brows were not even even and she had made one eyebrow noticeably thinner than the other. Definitely not going back to this mall next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This outlet has potential.

But in order for that to happen, a facelift needs to happen with the interior. They did a good job in reconstructing the exterior to look more modern and to match more like its sister North site but the inside lacks character and energy. It's almost sad.

The stores within the mall are getting better but not as good at the North location. This is the only reason I'd visit if I'm not in the mood to travel far for a specific item I need. The Nike Outlet, Pac Sun and Zumiez are my top stores here since I tend to be at the Fashion Show Mall with their options (Topshop, Zara; etc) but you can really find something here for a good deal. I'm never here to kill time though. The atmosphere isn't my favorite and I'm almost always needing a cup of coffee as I'm leaving.

It'll be cool if they gutted the tiles, added skylights throughout to have more natural light inside, and create a more chic and modern environment that makes it enjoyable. In a city that's always changing, this mall deserves to change for the better since it's already on The Strip. Then it'll flourish."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and it is definitely not my favorite LV outlet, it's run down and the last time I was there is was getting a much needed overhaul. Because Nike is there I'll still stop here but it's only for Nike and then it's time to get back to doing other things. When we plan out the day of shopping in Vegas we will plan to get to the other outlet, the outdoor one when the weather is best. Once it's hot as balls outside we will stop in here to cool off in NIke and blow a few bucks and once we stop sweating in the summer or freezing from the winter we leave. 
Honestly the weather in Vegas sucks. No idea who wants to live there. I'll stick to visiting."}
{"text":"During the summer and winter months, when outdoor malls can be unbearable due to the weather, this mostly-enclosed outlet mall is an oasis.  They expanded their store mix by adding merchants along the outside of the mall.  It looks very different from the first time I visited in 2005.  Although there are only a few stores that I actually shop in (that's the way it is for me in every outlet mall), I find it worth visiting here because of the climate control, usually-sufficient parking, and good selection of restaurants both inside and along the outer edges of their parking lot."}
{"text":"Guest services don't have their policies together. They will ask to hold your state I.d. So I asked if you are shopping and using your credit card they will ask for your credit card. The black lady said just tell them guest services have it. So my brother let them hold his I.d. When I went shopping I explained to an employee at the store if I'm charging will I need my state I.d. she said \"yes\". So if I gave my I.d. and I went shopping and they needed to verify my name with my credit card I would have to return back the wheel chair we rented for my mom. I don't recommend coming here if you need to rent a wheel chair. Zero stars but was forced to give 1 star."}
{"text":"I love the outlet mall. It's a good enough size, not too small and not too big. It has a great variety of stores. They also have amazing deals going on at the stores. The people there are also very nice!"}
{"text":"I found this to be an amazing outlet. Visiting Las Vegas and wanted to do some shopping. For military, most stores offer discounts with military ID. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"This isn't really a premium outlet but you still get good prices for the stuff here. There are a few high-end stores but it's mostly middle-class stores. This place is getting bigger every day. They are adding more shops with more restaurants in here. It's actually a pretty crowded place on Sundays right before everyone heads back to California. It is indoors so it's definitely better than the north outlets in that way. I do stop by if I need to kill time but it's not on my list of \"must visits\" like the north Las Vegas outlets.

If you want the AC while shopping outlets, you'd want to stop by here!"}
{"text":"Sucks. Prices are ok but not the quality. Far away from strip. Allot junk in general . Would not go again"}
{"text":"It seems over the  last few days I've been here quite a bit and have probably spent way too much money. But I've gotten some really good deals.  And two of my kids work here. 
It's also a really good place to walk out of the heat and get some exercise. 
Good restaurants in front of it."}
{"text":"I did 90% of my shopping from this mall. It had a wide range of outlet stores to choose from and it was easy to get around. What was also awesome is the parking stall indicator. If there was a parked call, it would have a red light above the stall. If it was empty, the light would be green. Very, very helpful when looking for parking."}
{"text":"Premium Outlets South is the indoor mall. This was a good thing since the day we went, it was storming. I still prefer the North as it's almost double the size. Ann Taylor, Nike, Hush Puppies, Lane Bryant, Hot Topic, and Sean John were some of the stores that I'd seen. This mall is definitely long. I felt like I was walking forever. Along the way, we saw two food courts. 

I didn't find the prices at the outlets here to be much cheaper than the regular retail stores. I live in Hawaii and the prices here were comparable to home. I didn't end up buying anything. I wasn't about to buy something that was a dollar or two cheaper to lug it home.

If you check in on your Yelp app you get the free coupon book which usually costs $10. The lady working behind the counter said that I was the first person she encountered who did this. She'd never seen the check in before and didn't know about it. She just gave me the book anyway."}
{"text":"I came in shopping for shoes and found everything I could want here. The mall and floors are clean. There is literally almost nothing you can't get or find here. 

Also if you're in here and need a phone case try \"Case Yard\". They offer hand crafted wood phone cases for iPhone 5 and 6 plus models included. Beautiful cases."}
{"text":"Love the new O'neill store!!! The remodel looks good!!!"}
{"text":"There really isn't much to complain about this outlet mall. In the dead of summer, what other location is going to offer free AC and miles of different stores for my browsing?!

I enjoyed this location much better than the North location. It is an all indoor outlet which entails a lot of different stores. Yes, some of the stores seem outdated and could use a makeover or switch out of more popular ones but it will do for now.

They have a couple of food courts which provides a good variety of food options. Don't forget those little shops in the center that sell specialty popcorn or pretzels. It's a great place to cool down, window shop, eating and calorie burn.

The prices are definitely not that discounted though they make it sound like you're getting mad deals. If you go to enough outlets you will know that most of them don't really give that much of a discount. All they do is jack up the price and say buy on get one free. Don't think for a second you are in the win lol"}
{"text":"My tip to surviving hot weather is to go into an air-conditioned environment and hibernate. Each day that I was in Las Vegas in July, the temperature was at least 110°F. 

My friend and I enjoy shopping. This outlet mall was close to our hotel. We decided to drive over there and beat the oppressive heat.

I love this mall. It has my main stores that keep me happy, such as Gap Factory, Skechers, and Fossil. I also discovered new stores that I love, like Kipling.

For years, I have wanted something with a cute dangling gorilla. I couldn't afford anything until I found this Kipling store. I could buy a wallet and a pencil case at great prices. Back then, I wasn't interested in getting a purse from this store. Perhaps the next time that I am back, I will get one. I have had both items since July 2015, and they work and look great to this day.

My friend and I tore up the Gap Factory store. I have not purchased anything from a typical mall Gap store in years. Rather, a lot of my wardrobe comes from the factory store. You get huge discounts and you look great. 

We both bought so much stuff at the Gap store that we had to brave the heat to put all our goodies in my steaming car rental's trunk. It was worth not lugging everything around for hours.

We did a couple of breaks at Starbucks. We made sure that we were hydrated with beverages and I had a sugar cookie the second time.

I love this mall. It is huge, so you can easily spend hours here. The prices are great and it's always satisfying to get what you want at a discount.

{"text":"Depending on your style or clothing preference, this outlet may be or may not be for you.  If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.

Levis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.

Quicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  

Now for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.  

This place isn't as nice or as big as the Premium but its really close to where I live and has all the stores I prefer and this is the reason for my 4 star."}
{"text":"This outlet was situated right close by my hotel off the strip.  I got almost every single souvenier that I needed to get here, as they've got some great deals on T-shirts.

It's laid out in one huge strip (not ideal if you want to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time), but they've got a decent selection of stores, and it's all indoors.

The food court selection isn't great, and even though they have a huge selection of restaurants directly in front of the mall, they are all chains.  Kinda dissapointing, but I guess that's what you expect to see at any mall in america."}
{"text":"Looking for bargains in Vegas?  Don't go to the Strip, with its skeevy souvenir stores and pricey casino malls.  Instead, head over to the Las Vegas Outlet Mall, where you can actually get something for your money besides the thrill of plunking it into a one-armed bandit.

This outlet mall is huge, and it just goes on and on...and on.  And on.  It's so big that there are two food courts, and one of them is located next to a carousel.  Yes, there is a somewhat random feel to the layout and selection of stores, but it's such a diverse mix that there will be something for everyone in your group to browse through - though you might have some trouble meeting up again later.

Some of my favorite stores include the Fossil outlet, which has tables of $20 and $30 watches (but make sure they check the battery before you leave); Charlotte Russe, which has a fun mix of funky and bohemian women's clothes, and a giant clearance rack in the back (I got a super-cute skirt there for $8 that I wear all the time); Vans, which has styles you won't see in regular stores and a big sale section; and Levi's, where you can get irregulars for half the price of normal Levi's.

Other notable stores include Liz Claiborne, Jones New York, Nike, Reebok, and Tommy Hilfiger.  Shoe lovers will find Adidas, Bass, Skechers, and Naturalizers, among others.  There are home furnishings stores (Mikasa, Black & Decker), leather stores (Wilson, and, soon, Coach), and gourmet foods (Harry & David, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory).  

As with any \"outlet\" mall, there are some stores that seem suspiciously non-outlet, and some weird stores that are just oddball (like the rocks 'n' geodes shop).  Plan to spend at least an afternoon here, particularly if you're hiding out from the intense Vegas heat.  You may spend more than you planned - I always do - but unlike at the casinos, at least you'll have something to show for it when you head back home."}
{"text":"If you dont like fighting the crowd and an indoor shopping experience, this is the place to go. Other wise, this place sucks.  I'd rather go to the Premium outlets on the North end of LV. The selection at this outlet sucks, but I hear that change is on the way with some new anchor stores. BUT then again, thats what Obama promised the people, change...the kind thats in your pocket (shameless political jab)  I really didn't like this outlet, probably one of the \"bottom 5\" outlets I've been to."}
{"text":"Here's my suggested itinerary for the Las Vegas Outlet Center: Park at Burlington Brands and enter this wonderland of cheapness. Okay, so they're not stocking Vogue fashion here. However, they are stocking plenty of solid colored knits for $10 and under, and some crazy $3 ties. It's worth a looksie. Then, head straight. Watch out for the kiosk hucksters or you may end up with Dead Sea Salts, a smokeless cigarette, some jewelry cleaner and a knockoff Sham-Wow. Stop by Calvin Klein and head to the back where they generally have a good selection of an additional 50-70% off items. Next stop, Vans. The store is much bigger than the Premium Outlet location. While you're in skater mode, visit Hurley. They have some cute stuff for the ladies, and if you are in complete teen angst you can check out Hot Topic. (They have some unique accessory options, like glittery fishnet stockings.) Always stop by the classic Adidas store. Good finds have included a Def Jams track suit and a stash of Star Wars collectibles. Yoda tennis shoes anyone? If you're in the market for \"come hither\" heels or just shoes, Closet has a pretty good selection if you don't mind wearing Carlos, Jessica or Fergie! And for the grand finale, explore hair options at the wig shop. You'll have to invest $6 for a wig cap to try on a full wig, but it's worth the investment if you are considering a color or cut change! (I personally learned I would make a hideous blonde!) They also have a good selection of extensions and smaller hair additions. If you've still got juice, you can head over to Off Saks. Otherwise, call it a day and come back soon as it looks like the place is undergoing a face lift. I admit I'll miss the neon. Generally, I am a fan of any place where I can find a deal, but the interior isn't too snazzy (maybe that will change with the facelift), and the snack options aren't too tasty."}
{"text":"Well all I really have to say about this outlet versus the north one. Less high end shops but it's inside which is nice during the summer."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a shopper but whenever I'm in Vegas & in the mood for shopping this is the place for me! There's a photography shop, lots of shoe stores to satisfy this shoe fiend & usually find great deals on clothes. 

The outlet is currently under construction which makes it a bit inconvenient to enter the mall."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said, not a great outlet but will do.  If you have limited time to shop while in Vegas I would suggest going to the North Outlet over this one.  If you're from the bay area its very much similar to the Great Mall but crappier.

The ONLY reason I would come here is for the Nike Outlet.  Skip everything else inside."}
{"text":"While in town hopped the bus down to this mall, and I can say it as a waste of time.  Walked end to end nothing caught our interesting, and the food court was not very inviting ether, we left with nothing and have never been back."}
{"text":"No different than any outlet malls across the nation. Most of the store were located indoor with excellent AC. A good selection of big name stores and fast food eateries. Lots of kiosks with annoying sale people. It was an ok place to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Like the Premium Outlets North...except indoors, lower end, and cramped with center kiosks attempting to sell you garbage...so basically nothing like the Premium Outlets North and not really 'Premium' at all save for the Coach Store and perhaps Calvin Klein which is seemingly giving away their products at 25cents on the dollar during most visits.  Good for staples but certainly not the designer shopping experience it bills itself to be there are gems to be found for those willing to shop around but on the whole this is just another outlet mall, no more and no less."}
{"text":"Good outlets close to the strip!  

A good selection of stores with decent prices.  I would say to know your prices first. Some stores had deals that weren't such good deals.  It's an easy layout to navigate. We came in one end and did a lap around the entire mall.  It's actually set up more like a mall.  Plenty of places to eat; mostly quick service with a food court.  There are some stores that are accessible from the outside only. 

One gripe: The pushy kiosk workers.  When navigating the mall, we were constantly asked how our day was going or if we wanted some sample of rejuvenating cream. We politely replied \"no thank you\", but it got old once we were heading back to the entrance."}
{"text":"This location is easy for me as a local and (insert disclaimer) I believe has more of a selection and stock versus the other location. Parking is a hell of a lot easier;)
The staff always available and willing to go that 'extra mile' and check the back room stock, or call the other location. If all fails, they suggest other ways of searching for the Adidas merchandise you  so desire.  A little over a year ago I was interested in customizing a pair of Adidas online, went to this location for the sizing of the style I was interested in ordering online. They were custom and would take a month:( Told them and they assisted!
Now, Mario whom works here is an absolute pleasure.  Friendly, always around the store overseeing that one is helped.  Even informed me of the tent sale they were having in the near future. This visits purchase: a pair of Adidas slides ( Captain America ) kid's.  That's right, a Marvel superhero and kid's- don't judge;)"}
{"text":"Nowhere near as good as the outlet in Primm or The North location but worth the stop nonetheless.
there are not as many upscale outlets, more mainstream but there are still great deals to be found.
It doesn't get as full here and there is parking all around with many entrances.
Anything is better than paying retail or inflated strip shopping prices, so get your shopping fix at any of the 3 great Vegas outlets!"}
{"text":"I love love love love these outlets!  If you are in Vegas and looking for some killer great high end outlet deals this is the place to go!

The outlet is HUGE and they have tons of great stores and places to eat and just enough kitschy kiosks to be fun without being over the top.

Parking is easy and we spent just over 2 hours walking around and shopping.  I left with some great Coach and Calvin Klein steals!  My mother picked up some awesome stuff from Layne Bryant.

I will absolutely be going back next time I am in Vegas. 

Minus one star because they don't have Kate Spade yet."}
{"text":"The one perk of this outlet is that is it fully indoor and with the Las Vegas he is a very good thing especially in the summertime. Compared to the northside outlet the stores in here are a little bit more in the lower price range so if you want more designer outlet that you might want to check the north premium outlet but keep in mind the north is all outdoor.

Since it is close to the strip on the weekend there are a lot of Torrance to keep that in mind but it seems like the deals are more towards the weekend rush. Parking is good there's a lot of parking space available and since it is in Las Vegas Blvd. there are a lot of restaurants in the area as well.

compared to the north outlet there is less of a crowd so if you have about an hour before your flight and you want to kill time this is a good place to go especially in the summertime."}
{"text":"Public service announcement: This place gets CROWDED.  And now back to your regularly scheduled review. 

Oddly, I'd never been here before yesterday.  I really do like the outlets on the north end and never had a reason to come to these.  But I figured I'd give them a shot after getting some flooring bids in the area.  I couldn't even walk through this place it was so damn crowded!  

There are quite a few stores here but the assortment doesn't seem as good as the ones on the other end.  There are some more \"high end\" outlet stores at the other one.  This one does have one big plus on a hot July day - most of it is INDOORS.  Oh, sweet air conditioning.  

Can't see a reason I'd come back here.  My AC works well at home when I'm shopping online and there are no crowds there."}
{"text":"Formally known as the BELTZ Outlet, the LV Premium Outlets South is quite an understatement.

The only places that they've got going for them are:
- Coach
- Nike
- Michael Kors
- Gap & Banana Republic

They've done an upgrade to the place, although the interior still needs to be worked on. There are a couple shops that I feel don't even belong as an outlet store. I feel that most of the places here are just last year's items or merchandise made specifically for outlets to sell. Like they just put a nice brand name label to unworthy quality of goods!

Like all malls, they have independent kiosk shops that sell frou frou items that nobody ends up purchasing! Pillow pets?! Hair straighteners?! Massage?!

Overall thought: Just be cautious purchasing items at outlet stores, it might be best to take your money elsewhere for decent quality than a cheap-made-for-outlet-item that will only be worth 2-3 wears before it gets worn down. I prefer the Charleston Outlets (off the 15) over this one."}
{"text":"Ehhh Its ok. I liked it before they remade it over. The deals were better before then too. The food court is still the same. And people in the kiosks are pushing stuff on you, that you clearly dont need. But as with everything look hard enough and you will find a deal hiding somewhere. Also if you dont want the food in the court. Good restaurants in the surrounding parking lot arent in short supply either."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I like the new upgrade with the outdoor stores. I am sad that iZod will be leaving in May but this means we'll have to find another place for us to find men's shorts...
The Starbucks only has one brewer so there is no options on favors. Pikes place is the only bold coffee. 
The other places are okay and I like the indoor part especially when it gets hot.  But the other outlets has stores that I like to visit.   That makes it tough for us when we shop."}
{"text":"I think I went  here several years ago and I went back again during my latest Vegas trip.  I heard there's better bargains at the SOUTH, as opposed to the north outlet mall.  I had pactically forgotten how this place was and which stores they had, but this mall's OK.  There's definitely nothing upscale about it.  Just a basic outlet mall and close to the swap meet type appearance on the inside as you're walking through it.  I did find some black ankle boots from the Hush Puppies store there.  I like that they had a Dr. Scholl's shoe store there!  They have 2 food courts too.  By the way, I have never seen a New York & Company Outlet store, but this place has it.  Overall, I want to give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This was one of the first, if not the first outlet mall in Las Vegas. With that being said, it has seen it's better days. With a name change and some renovation it is looking less dilapidated, but it is not quite there yet. 

The new exterior and outside shops hide the eye sore of an inside. The going out of business sale for Harry and David brought me back, but it was a quick in and out process. The new outlets give off a similar feel to the Charleston Outlets, but smaller. With the addition of little embellishments and improvements on the inside, it might go back to it's former glory. 

The shops offer great deals, but driving a little bit further to the aforementioned outdoor mall is a better experience. You get to walk around outside, the cheap deals, the facilities are well maintained."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Vegas that does not completely empty your pocketbook! I love having the outlets as a shopping option. They have all of my favorite stores too...Tory Burch, Nike, the 'bucks and many more. The Nike store is massive and stocked with goodies and steals. There's a parking garage and also valet parking. It's great on a day when you want to escape the strip for a bit! Very family friendly too."}
{"text":"Typical Outlet Mall.  Favorite stores were Hurley and Calvin Klein. I don't know what I expected from a Las Vegas Outlet Mall, but I was surprised that it wasn't any better than the Malls we have in Wisconsin. I did buy a few things, but I won't be using up valuable vacation time here on my future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Lots of stores, and  loads of post Holiday sales......  I will recommend that you check this place out over the two weeks after of Christmas...."}
{"text":"I'm not much for shopping, I do not like to just stroll down the mall and window shop.  I'm the kind a gal that likes to go to one store and be done, get in and get out.  I have my list or I know what I am looking for and go for it.  So this mall is hard for me to go with shopping in mind.  My husband and I usually go when relatives are here from out of town and we go just to keep them company.

We usually go in at one end, while my husband moves the car around to the other end so we walk one way and hit the car without having to double back.  One thing I do not like is the kiosk vender's.  The are in your face wanting to sell you something.  They do not take a gentle \"no thank you\" and I am not one to be mean.  There are a few good stores I usually hit, especially if I am looking for shoes, but, I get a better deal shopping on line.

Most of the stores have been around for a while, but it's refreshing to see some change.  Overall, a good place to shop, if you're into that!"}
{"text":"Nice place to kill some time (if you need to) like we did before our flight home.

+ It's air conditioned
+ Lots of places to eat (food courts inside, restaurants like IHOP, Outback, Chilis, Chipotle, etc. outside)
+ A lot of shops that we don't have at home
+ Since it's an outlet mall, MOST of the stores offer decent prices
+ There's a carousel.  Our little ones spotted it (it's huge, so it's kind of hard to miss) and immediately had to ride it.  It was a nice diversion, but at $3.00 a ride it was a bit pricey.
+ Lots of parking

- I don't like to shop :-("}
{"text":"The mall was pretty big, it was indoor mall and cool inside. They have 2 food courts, and other snacks place like dunkin and pretzel. They have all the sport retail store that I most liked, and they have basic stores like other outlets mall"}
{"text":"I love shopping for bargains, so I was very excited to start bargain hunting when my friend dropped me off here. It's a covered mall which is a big plus, especially when the weather outside gets too hot (one star). It has a variety of shops found at most malls and outlets (another star). It's in a convenient location that's a little off the hustle and bustle of the Strip (third star).

My state offers a lower sales tax, so I found myself skipping the places available at my local mall and going to the very few places I didn't have access to. However, I found that most of the pricing didn't seem to reflect their supposed outlet status. Most, if not all, of the stores I visited offered mostly the same selection that you would find at any other non-outlet mall store. 

I think international visitors might benefit more from this mall than domestic ones. But, it's still a good place to walk around and check out.

Like someone mentioned in the tips below: They give a discount pamphlet to AAA members. Get your pamphlet at the information kiosk."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to do, so I think this is best left to bulletpoint format until I get to my final point of contention.

The Goods:
* You can get some great clothing items for very good prices.
* They are currently remodeling the front-end, so hopefully the result will pay off for the Center.

The Bads:
* It's on the ass-end of the Strip.  You don't happen to wander upon this unless you are specifically looking for it, or get one of those motels down in that area (And why would you?).
* Other than the carousel, it's not very kid friendly, as all the stores that could have proven entertaining have closed down in the last year or so.  I'd suggest a babysitter, or pray they like hanging out in the food court.
* There's a few kitchen places, and one or two specialty stores, but largely, there's not a lot of diversity in the shopping experience.

Now.  For the biggest complaint.  And the reason I HATE coming out to this place.

The mall kiosk vendors.

Look, I did this sort of job once way back in the day.  Its not glamorous, and it's boring because you are usually stuck selling things no one really thinks about buying.  Or wants.  But I refer to this Outlet Center as \"The Gauntlet\".

Kiosk after kiosk of rude, pushy people who chase you down, yell at you from across the way, rub their wares on you whether you ask (or want) them to or not, and my favorite is when they actually stand in your way to block you and force you to stop.  And when you try to sidestep them, they sidestep WITH you to keep you blocked.  

Oh, Hell no.

At this point, you aren't going to get my business, but you are going to get something else from me.  And you're not going to like it.

It is what it is, and as long as you stick to the sides of the mall, or use some other customer as your sacrificial lamb walking through to \"feed\" the kiosk people, you can find some nice clothing options here.  Anything else, it's not what you could call an \"exciting\" shopping experience."}
{"text":"These outlets have a good selection and the air conditioning is a plus when its hot. Prices are not as great as in the past, meaning I see no difference from the deals here or a regular mall. There are some stores that flat out have the same prices as regular. The only other drawback is there are sections where cell service is non-existent."}
{"text":"This outlet mall has drastically improved! It is no longer the quiet boring mall with only two good stores.  Now it's got many great stores such as Michael Kors, DKNY, True Religion, Coach Men's, and Under Armour.  

Many of the new stores are only accessible from the outside. So if you're inside the mall and you can't find a certain store but you know it's there cause you've seen it on the directory, well,  just exit the mall and you'll find that store you're looking for.

I came here last night to shop at the Levi's store and unfortunately there were no good sales so I left without buying anything. Very rare for me.

There is plenty of parking and I do have a favorite spot to park at just because there is less traffic and easier for me to enter and exit the lot.

By the way, this mall opens at midnight on Black Friday (Friday after Thanksgiving) and I was here last year for it and OMG, it was sooo packed!"}
{"text":"Love shopping this mall. You can find the latest and greatest fashions here for a lot less than you would at a regular mall. One of my favorite stores, Burlington Brands is gone and I'm sad to see it go. I bought a lot of my work gear from there.

I frequent Rue 21, Calvin Kline amongst others. The one annoying thing here is the retail carts in the walkway of the mall. I swear you cannot take two steps without one of the super aggressive and annoying people that work them stopping you and trying to get you to sample what they are selling. So annoying!!!! Hint....everything those carts sell is overpriced! The shops in this mall are super cheap, but the items at all of these carts are way overpriced! Don't get duped!! 

Last, bring your walking shoes. This place is huge! Meaning, it is long. One-story, so you'll be walking for a long, long time! Three stars due to the annoying cart salespeople. Otherwise, four stars."}
{"text":"Blew a tonne of money here, more than in the Casinos! Plenty of great shops and some ridiculously good bargains (although that was during the 4th of July sales). The food court is pretty OK."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.. I love vintage goods and vintage stores when that is what is intended. I don't think i am supposed to get the feeling that I am window shopping in the 80's while walking around this place but needless to say I do.  The air is stale the isles are very narrow, thus making it feel like you are at a fair when you walk by the midway games and carnies nag you to play the game, this is the same thing with the accented people working the booths in the middle, sometimes I just want to tell them no I don't want 5 balls for a dollar and I know I am really not guaranteed to win... Back to those isles and how narrow they are, which depending on my mood sometimes makes me want to clothes line someone just to say I did. But then the inner Raymond speaks to me and Says..... psssss, hey don't do it. So needless to say I have never done it. The only other plus that I have found here is the quality of the people watching.. Man you can tell a story just by looking at some of the clientele that walks around in this place, maybe one day I will stop one of them and ask them for their name and location and I will yelp about them.

The Ups and downs are as follows:

Ups:
People watching
Claw machines around every corner \" I love those stupid things\"
Close to my house

Downs:
The prices are relatively high and are not outlet deals
Smells funny
Ugly decor
Narrow walkways 
Odd store selection

I guess if you are bored and have nothing better to do this is always an option but I don't know that i would make it my first option."}
{"text":"i hit jackpot here, 50% off at the Coach outlet, you gotta be here at a certain time of the year to get those 50% off! gotta luv the outlet stores, especially the premium ones!"}
{"text":"Never knew that there was such a wonderful outlet mall in Vegas! Friendly and helpful sales associates, great food/snack options for when you need a shopping break, many shoe stores and brand name retailers with amazing prices (true bargains) - will definitely make a stop here again on another visit"}
{"text":"This mall is really depressing and there are no good stores. I felt like the food courts had more people than the rest of the mall. 

We walked through the whole mall in about an hour or less. They do not have anything. Waste of time."}
{"text":"First time going through here and glad my boyfriend and I stopped by before heading out.

I really like how a lot of their shops were indoors like a mall because the heat was definitely getting to us when we went early Sunday morning. There were definitely a bunch of stores that I recognized, such as Addidas, Aerosoles, Hot Topic, and Vans. But there were also some that we didn't recognized, but enjoyed window shopping as we jumped from store to store that caught our eyes. Some of the stores were having sales going on either as a promotional thing they did or just because they were outlet versions of stores you would see at the mall and such.

They do have two food court areas and some restroom stalls for your convenience placed inside the outlet. And we were able to check out the other stores outside of the indoor outlet. There were other restaurants outside that we recognized, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, but they were on the other side of the parking lot across from the outlet stores and just too far to go over there in the heat.

My boyfriend and I did end up buying some stuff that were on sale before heading out on to the road."}
{"text":"Chintzy. Ghetto. Waste of time. I don't care if the are expanding!! Even the seasonal holiday stores (Halloween costumes, calendars etc) look better than this place!

Don't let the word \"outlet\" fool you.... there isn't much to see here. A Levi's outlet... a Hot Topic outlet... discount Corningware... WHOOO!

I'm actually sitting into the car writing this review right now while I wait for extended family to browse through this craphole. And that says a lot about how bad this place is, since I NEVER say no to shopping!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, there are no good shops here at all.  Try the Premium outlets, they seem much better from the store listings and from passing it on the freeway."}
{"text":"The interior needs an update for sure. This outlet mall will always be known as the Belz outlet to me as that was the old name for it back in the day. The exterior of the entire outlet mall has been redone to match more modern outlets but the inside of the place looks outdated. I mainly just go here for Nike and is usually my first stop after flying in and picking up my rental as the facility is located on nearby Gillespie St.

There are plenty of other stores such as Adidas, Osh Kosh, Disney store, etc but there are also some that you would expect to be there but are not. For the life of me, we couldnt find Banana Republic or Gap. And I was sure we walked the entirety of the place. 

Plenty of parking. It can be very busy at times especially on the weekends. Just avoid the high traffic times and bring some patience when it comes to parking and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Although this place isn't as big as the the Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas in Primm, there are still a lot of great stores and selections!

Some of the store selections include Coach, Michael Kors, Levi's, PacSun, Express, Hot Topic, Zumiez, Swarovski, Disney Store, and The Children's Place. The map of the place is simple. The whole mall has indoor and outdoor components, which sets it apart from the outlet in Primm (it's all indoors).

The honey was able to get 4 pairs of Levi's jeans, which were all under $20 and a bunch of shirts from Hot Topic (they had a BOGO deal). Overall, this is a great place for not only shopping, but a hanging out/sightseeing place for families and friends too."}
{"text":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PUSHY KIOSK VENDORS????
Being latina but living in Vegas not once but twice in one visit I was confused by a tourist and stop for two different vendora to try the products. I dont want to, I tell them but they keep talking as they can't listen to what I saying. Im a really polite and nice person but this is almost harassment at the middle of the Mall, they speak really loud and I just don't  understand how the manager don't do something about it. 
If I say no thanks thats it.
If I want your product I will let you know. 
What bothers me the most its they do this specially to tourist who sometimes don't understand what the heck is going on. 
Cmon people this suppose to be a nice place and I don't expect to be yell at when Im shopping."}
{"text":"Hugo Boss here is not that good. It lacks many things especially accessories."}
{"text":"I like this place. Has my sean john, nautica and ecko cheap clothes. My wife and i shop the whole mall looking for good deal. Always leave with bags from here. My favorite mall in vegas, no show all go. Must go if you are on a budget, or just like getting stuff cheaper than other malls."}
{"text":"One star- nice cashiers. All asking where I was from and genuinely nice. The Lucky Store, my guy scored two pairs of his fave jeans (Triumph) and was helped by a super nice asian guy (regret that I forgot his name) for $29.99 each!!!!
Two stars- nice big selection of food courts
Three stars- easy taxi accessibility

- 1 star- not a lot of designer stores AT ALL (should've headed to the north outlet mall for my kate spade and Ferragamo). Eh, oh well. 
- 1 star- dirty bathrooms. Yuck."}
{"text":"The kimco services sucks at there job ! The mall is always dirty . The restrooms are disgusting .. they need to bring back the old company .. this mall how's gone down since kimco took over .. and the management is shitty never working !"}
{"text":"This is the older outlet mall in Las Vegas and it's not as shiny as its newer counterpart downtown but judge a book by it's cover! It has a number of stores that offer incredible deals because they have new competition a few miles away! One of my favorites is the Sean John Factory Store (only one in Las Vegas), it has the same product you'll find in the department stores at unbelievable prices! When you're next in Las Vegas, visit the Las Vegas Outlet Center and the Sean John Factory Store!"}
{"text":"Clothes, clothes, clothes what more can I say than to come here and fill your closet with more clothes. I came here because I need something warm for my son to wear during a football tournament in November. I did pick up the free coupon book thanks to a Yelp Check in. That coupon book did save me $5 at Under Armor so I do suggest getting it if you planning on doing some big spending. I wasn't impressed with the sales since I live next to an outlet in Los Angeles and I am used to the price cuts but if you don't have that luxury definitely some great buys. Next time you come to Sin City you come and drop a couple hundred hear and you will always come out a winner."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this outlet mall bc I found it to not have any empty retail spaces. That's rare nowadays as people love to shop online. Plus they have several food courts in there as well as fast food restaurants in the parking lot. You know most shopping centers their food courts are very unappealing most of the time.

We parked on the south end. OK what end is that? LOL Then walked to the north end and back. Parking was very plentiful & free. Be sure to wear your walking shoes as I wore my stylish non-comfortable boots! I would have preferred my more comfy athletic shoes. 

We came on a Friday the first of December so it was a gorgeous day outside. Yes 67 degrees! But if you come during the hot summer the air conditioned all indoor mall will be your respite for sure!

Get ready to go shopping bc there are some deals to be had. For example: Lucky, Disney, Chico's, Spencer's, Clark's & more piqued my interest. Aerosoles currently was undergoing an out of business sale. Go shopping now! Can someone pick up that purple flowery top for me from Chico's & bring it back to Cali? Never mind I bought it online! LOL"}
{"text":"Always stop here because we always find great deals at this store. My husband picked up a watch at Kenneth Cole that was 40% off. A great deal. The gentleman helping us was so nice, well dressed and very helpful with our purchase.
We got great deals at the Ecko Unlimited store. Picked up some shorts for $19.99 and graphic t's for $9.99, cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Compared to the North Premium Outlet Mall this one is a bit of a letdown.  They recently remodeled the exterior and added some new stores, but the interior is just as old, dated and dodgy as ever.

Do yourself a favor and just head to the North Premium Outlet Mall.

If you have been to the North Outlet Mall and didn't find what you needed there then perhaps head to this location - I do this for the Adidas and Timberland stores, but I then leave as quickly as possible.

The best part of this mall is that there are a bunch of restaurants between the mall and Las Vegas Blvd (still in the parking lot for the mall) - our favorite is Chipotle, but there are a bunch of choices."}
{"text":"We always make it a point to do some shopping here whenever get get to Vegas. Good deals and plenty stores. That being said, Black Friday is nuts!!!   You can hardly move in here. No place to sit and eat.  It is just plain crowded. Oh well, I kind of did expect this."}
{"text":"Once in a while when I'm in Las Vegas, I like to stop by this outlet mall near the Las Vegas McCarran International airport area............... the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet.

If you're looking for a deal, you may consider checking this mall out. To me, it's like any other outlet mall that I would go to in California, or in my home state- da 808. 
Only difference is this particular outlet mall in Las Vegas is Mega Huge!!!! Therefore, this outlet mall probably has more stores then your average outlet mall...........

If you're not into shopping, this mall still has a purpose................ as you can walk this huge mall for exercise! 
A nice feature about the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet is that this mall is an \"indoor mall\", so in the hot summers you won't have to worry about the extreme Las Vegas heat, and in the winter you won't have to worry about the cold weather either.

There are tons of stores in this mall, as well as two food courts. Some of my favorite stores I like to check out are - Nike, Under Armour, Quiksilver, Converse, & Vans.

The list of stores at this outlet mall are pretty endless........too many stores to mention here, so I will just post a link so you can see the various stores & eateries at this outlet mall.

http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/las-vegas-south/stores

If for some reason you don't have a car to get to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall, no need to fret, as there is a smaller version of this outlet mall near the downtown Las Vegas area called - the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet. 

The North Premium Outlet may not be as big, or have as much stores, but if you just happen to stay at a hotel in the downtown area like - the California Hotel, Fremont, Four Queens, Golden Nugget, Main Street, The D, Plaza Hotel, or Downtown Grand Hotel, the North Premium Outlet Mall is not too far away from these downtown hotels........... 

You can probably take a long walk, catch a bus, or even a taxi down to the North Premium Outlet Mall, as it's not too far away.

Overall, I'd rather go to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall, as I like the indoor shopping atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Comfortable shopping, all quality brands available, some store are mostly retail , not outlets. Compared to Cabazon and Ontario outlet malls, store assistants are not very helpfull offering discounts or giving additional discount options.  Shopped in November , so sun and heat were not a problem. We actually enjoyed sitting in the corridors. Lots of seating areas. Smoking is allowed , perk for smokers and problem for non smokers. Great shopping experience, missing star for store personnel ( by the way, i had none, it is a general observation) , the other half missing is for potential extreme heat in summer.  Take a hat if going anytime after april. Have fun and enjoy"}
{"text":"Hm.  I don't see why the lower review.

I didn't even know about this outlet... only the north one.  This one is better for one main reason.  IT'S INDOORSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.  Indoors = AC = happiness in Vegas.

That is all.

Actually, parking is much better than the other outlet as well :)

That is all."}
{"text":"When I first moved here in 2000 this was known as Belz mall and was the go to place for most of my shopping needs. I still think they have the best Nike outlet store around.

I went to buy some work pants, so I basically knew I wasn't going any farther than the first section where Nike is located, and of course where Haggar is. Haggar has been my go to place for work pants and shorts for a long time, and they didn't disappoint with $18 pairs of slacks. I think all this Yelping is expanding my waistline so I needed some bigger pants as most of my old stuff don't fit me no more. The nice part about Haggar is the flexible waist band that allows for some growth. 

I also snuck in the Kitchen Connection store which has some quality items at decent prices, as well as some discount items that come in handy. I got some screens for pans so grease don't splatter, a mini dip warming dish, and some silver bowls for pre-measured ingrediants. Now all I have to do is learn how to cook.

I did notice a Columbia Sportswear store where the old Burlington used to be, but didn't go in. They usually have quality stuff. Will have to check them out.

Lots and lots of mid-hallway vendors....almost too many. And the usual influx of tourists who don't speak English, blocking doorways and generally have no respect for their fellow man."}
{"text":"This place is always a total madhouse, but with lots of men's and women's clothing, lingerie, housewares, and other shops it's sort of become a discount Mecca. I love to come here for the discount shoes, the Billabong store, the lane Bryant, and the Roxy Quiksilver shop. There are plenty of friends that are empty right now, and both of the food courts are kind of lacking, but there are food options if you need them. Be prepared to walk behind slow poke idiots who don't know where they are going.."}
{"text":"Outlets are a hit or miss, depending what you're going for. They have a good alternative selection of brands (Element, Fox, Hurley, Vans, Converse, etc.) if you're into those brands, and also have other brands such as Coach, Charlotte Russe, and Windsor if you're into the others. 

The Outlets are a hit or miss because there are some stores you can get good deals on, and others are plain expensive. They just remolded everything from the outside in, so the interior/exterior decor is more modernized and cleaned up (which is always a plus). I believe the only major accredited store in the Outlets is Coach, and everything else is more of the secondary brands you hear that aren't top dogs but are still known. Still worth to give this place a browse through though, you might find something good."}
{"text":"South outlet is pretty good if you're into outlet malls. Every time I go it seems like the place is packed with more of a \"tourist-y\" crowd looking for those Outlet deals. 

They have a great selection of stores that include some of the \"classier\" outlets as well. I'm getting pretty partial to Hugo. . 

You need a Starbucks and a place to chill for a bit at the halfway mark they have you covered. 

The one thing I do find annoying is the vendors in the center of the walkways, the carts, can be a little pushy st times. Gives me the bazaar feel. I more or less like to just go shopping and not be annoyed so I'm pretty grateful when I pass by a cart and there is already some other potential \"customer\" being helped. 

All in all it's a place to go to spend some dough when you're in the deal mode of going to an outlet."}
{"text":"Nachdem wir die Las Vegas North Premium Outlets schon mehrfach aufgesucht hatten, wollten wir jetzt auch mal die Las Vegas South Premium Outlets entdecken. Aufgrund der teilweise negativen Berichte hatten wir uns bisher dort nicht blicken lassen.

Unter anderem findet man hier Adidas, Ann Taylor, Armani, Boss, Calvin Klein, Coach, Cole Haan, DKNY, Guess, Ascics, Levis, Nike, Michael Kors, Nautica, Reebok, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger, Polo Ralph Lauren und Under Armour, um nur einige zu nennen. Insgesamt findet man hier 145 Stores.

Auch wenn keine aktuelle Sales Aktion war konnte man wirklich sehr gute Einsparungen erzielen. Vorher sollte man ggf. auf der Homepage nach Coupons oder Aktionen suchen. Ich konnte 2 Paar Schuhe von Timberland für ca. 50 Dollar kaufen. Beide Paare waren um 70 % runtergesetzt und das zweite Paar wurde dann nochmals um 50 % reduziert. Da macht das Einkaufen Spaß.

Die Outlet Mall ist in einem Gebäude, schön klimatisiert und macht einen sehr gepflegten Eindruck. Der Food Court macht einen ansprechenden Eindruck. Kostenlose Parkplätze sind ausreichend vorhanden. Am Wochenende kann es schon mal sehr voll werden.

Insgesamt ein empfehlenswertes Outlet mit einer guten Auswahl von Geschäften. Ich würde es immer dem Las Vegas North Premium Outlet vorziehen."}
{"text":"Not bad outlet mall....they renovate and open new stores but still the outlet north much better with their store choices."}
{"text":"We always make an attempt to stop by to check out what is in store when we are in the neighborhood. We like a lot of the stores in this outlet mall so we always have a good chance in finding something we are looking for! 

We noticed this time that the cart vendors were not so aggressive and pushy this time as we strolled through the mall. It was actually a peaceful stroll from store to store for us. I wonder if someone said something to them or complained, or maybe they were simply all tired? It was a major difference this time as in past visits where we would be mobbed by every cart vendor. Anyhow it was refreshing to be left alone because, No I don't want my ring cleaned... No I don't want to ruin my nails by testing your magic nail polish...No I don't want to watch you iron and press a shirt...No I don't want you to ruin my makeup with a crappy facial in public because your cleanser will not magically make me look or feel younger....catch my drift?

My honey bunches of oats loves DC so I enjoy checking out the Lids store for new DC caps for him. 

This visit we hit the jackpot at The Converse store (see review).

This outlet mall is worth checking out for sure as there is a lot of great merchandise for a fraction of the cost indeed!








I am very kinky."}
{"text":"This is the BEST outlet mall I have ever been too! It was a little packed but it is outlets so that is expected. Great deals tons and tons of stores from high end spots to normal spots. I could be there from open to close"}
{"text":"This place has a little bit of everything. From high end brands to brands you've never heard of. Majority of the stores are inside and a few are outside. It does get pretty crowded here even when you are just walking around - window shopping."}
{"text":"This place looks really old and run down and when you get inside you feel the same. theres tons of brands and most of which have great sales going on. 

be weary of the kiosks. those guys are salesmen to the umpteenth power. 

theres food shops here and there but the 3 times ive visited the mall ive only went for the shopping and im outty.. no need to overstay such an unwelcoming experience."}
{"text":"Las Vegas South Premium Outlets is the sister outlet mall to the North Premium Outlets.  I usually prefer going to these outlets over the North Outlets because South is indoors.  It can get rough shopping in triple digit weather.  If I wrote this review a couple of years ago, I would've given it 2.5-3 stars based on the variety of stores this mall has.  I was stoked when I re-visited in November 2014 and found that a bunch of new stores had opened, including one of my favorites-Express.    

There's ample parking here and the mall is anchored at the entrances by the higher end outlets like Coach, Michael Kors and Guess.  They have a food court in the middle of the mall, kiosks spread out between all of the stores and my favorite kiosk right at the middle entrance, Dunkin' Donuts. 

This is a great little strip mall that's constantly changing due to the turnover in stores but the variety's usually not bad and its location can't be beat.  These outlets are just a few minutes away from McCarran International airport and really easy to find."}
{"text":"Love some of the stores, but hate the center isle hawkers who do not take NO for an answer!  Also, most prices are full retail..just say'in."}
{"text":"I love to hate this mall, it is always so crowded with tourists, tourists that are rude and have no idea how to walk the halls of a shopping mall. 

If you are a local, go at night.... An hour before closing and you are lucky enough to get in and out with everything you need, less the stress of the people that stop right in front of you, elbow you, smell funny Etc.

You are sure to get a deal but watch for the return policy, seems they have a stricter policy in place than if you are to visit the same store outside this mall. 

Also, if you want deals, pick up the magazine near the map..... It has coupons in it."}
{"text":"This is a decent outlet mall located on the far south end of the Las Vegas strip. It has a good mix of high-end (Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade) and non high-end stores (Vanity Fair/Wrangler/Lee store), and the majority of the stores are located inside the mall (nice for the hot, sweltering days). 

While here, the hubby and I discovered a Citizen watch store. Being huge fans of their Eco Drive watches, we had to stop in. Hubby didn't buy anything, but I found a great watch for only $99! 

If you get hungry, there is a large food court here, and there is a popcorn stand that you can smell from a mile away as well. 

One thing that I do wish the mall would crack down on are the kiosk associates and their aggressive nature. At least 3 times on our most recent trip here, we had kiosk workers practically leap out at us and yell to get our attention like carnival barkers. I absolutely cannot stand that. Listen, if I am at all interested in what you're selling, I will approach you. Okay? I also feel that there are way too many kiosks in the mall, period. It makes things rather congested when walking in the mall. Whoever is in charge of the mall, please look into this."}
{"text":"Tons of stores to chose from and ample parking but this place just has a strange vibe every time I walk in. I have no idea why it's just strange! Go early in the day because this place becomes overrun with tourists.

They do have a few places to eat in the food courts your typical mall fast foods. The place is kept reasonably clean for how busy it gets. Be careful crossing the parking lot though between tourists in rental cars having no clue where they are going and the ever persistent crazy taxi drivers it can be a tad bit dangerous out there."}
{"text":"Not my favorite outlet mall in Vegas, for you bay areans it reminds me a lot of Southland, except this place smells like feet.  

My favorite stores in here are the Hot Topic and Coach Outlets.  The Coach store here seems to have a really good selection here and I've bough oh about 3 purses there so far!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to these outlets since they used be called Belz. Honestly, I still call them that most of the time and probably won't stop any time soon. They have had a lot of renovation of this mall over the years and the result is positive.

I always enjoy perusing the stores and kiosks when I'm in the area. Not a huge fan of having the mall split up between the main portion and the annex, since I have to get back in my car and repark if I want to check out any of the stores on the side. Overall, I enjoy this outlet mall quite a bit and have been frequenting it quite a bit more lately since I work in the area."}
{"text":"Update Review!  Needed to give Las Vegas South Premium Outlets an upgrade.  Why?  The answer is because they have finished the makeover I requested!  Alright, maybe they did not have the makeover cause I mentioned it a few years ago.  Still, cool to think that I may have influenced it.  ;)

I must maintain that the best thing that I like about this outlet mall is that it is indoors so there is air conditioning!!  It is great to come here during the hot summer months.  The selection of stores is better now, but not as good as their sister outlet in town.  The selection of restaurants at their food courts appear improved also.  After this makeover, the place is more crowded so parking is difficult to find sometimes now.  I like walking around and browsing while my wife shops away.  There are deals to be found if you look hard enough.

Have to say that I am now a fan of the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall."}
{"text":"I get to go here every time I come to Vegas with my wife. She likes to shop and I do somewhat. This a large covered indoor shopping mall that is supposed to be items at a discount price. And in most cases that is true, but you have to know what the price is else where to know you are getting a deal. Me I get my Birkenstofck sandals here. You can get them just a cheep from other place mail order. But here I can try them on and make sure they are what I want. I like the kitchen shops and they used to have Black and Decker but no more. Boo. They used to have Wolf camera but no more. again Boo. For your wife they have a bunch of places to shop but for me it is limited to a few stores. As in most malls there are people in the center isles/walkways trying to sell you stuff you don't meed. There is a Starbucks for the Starbuck fans."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is outdated, hard to navigate and is really more like a large strip mall.

There was a sign on the North end of the building for the only store I wanted to go to - Skechers.  I parked there in hopes of getting in and out quickly.  Skechers is on the farthest South end of the building.  You live, you learn.

I wouldn't come here again, as the inside reminds me of a ghetto strip mall.  It has some \"higher-end\" stores, but most of the stuff is off-season or similarly priced to the regular mall."}
