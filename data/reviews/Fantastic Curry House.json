{"text":"Inside a plaza that caters to the local residential area.  Fantastic Curry House has a 10% discount during their GRAND opening period.  This attracts a few more locals mostly those that are tired of cooking at home or not worth cooking at home due to kicking the kids back to school.  I guess the TEENS go to Pixel8 next door  instead as it seems like I'm the bottom of the age bracket.  It took over a prior restaurant called Star Fruit Viet Cuisine I believe.  None of the 2 LCDs were on so I am guessing its a bit disappointing because a large draw for the Cantonese locals is to be able to watch SHOWS while eating their meal.  Maybe still hooking up the cables?  Curry Chicken with Rice($6.95) is kinda A-OK for the MILD tastebuds of this area as it came with Dark Meat Chicken, Curry, and Potatoes.  If you're like my mom, then you are always a fan of the Potatoes coated with the Curry rather than the actual protein itself.  If you need spicy, then you'll probably have to ask for more or use the Sriracha Hot Sauce from the condiments.  Menu includes some Thai/Viet Apps, Curry Roti, Viet Vermicelli, Various Rice Dishes, Spicy Noodle Soup, Viet Noodle Soup."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. I really like the chicken chop curry chicken(no bones) The roti is also very nice. Its not fancy and if you go there between 12 and 1 its full of students. However anytime after the lunch rush is perfect. It seems clean. The food is perfect for the price."}
{"text":"For the price and the amount of food you get, Fantastic Curry House is for sure Fantastic!!  My lunch specials for $6.25 includes:  - a funny tasting Tom Yum soup that has tons of cooked bean sprouts in it - a choice of pop or soy milk drink - a BBQ pork/spring roll bun  My bun was huge in portion but not in taste. Pork was a little dry, spring roll was deep fried in stale oil. However, I do remember Fantastic Curry House targeted lunch crowds are the students in the area. And students love here!   Next time maybe I will give their Curry chicken lunch set a try when I want a big lunch!!"}
