{"text":"Ordered my drink took 5-10 min to bring it out service wasnt amazing maybe due to the fact that we had a larger party at the restaurant, the lady serving us was very nice but spoke in broken English the grilled chicken quesadilla was good but a friend of mine got a hair in her food along with a hair in the chips we had they did not cook the taco shells and the rice was dry overall I think 1 1/2 stars is what I would give it but I can't do I'll b nice and give them 2"}
{"text":"Awful. It takes a really great or a REALLY terrible experience for me to take time to review something. This place was definitely the latter of the two. We saw our waitress twice, total - once we she took are drink order and once when she brought the drinks and took our order. Well in fairness, we saw her many times walk by staring at her phone and texting, not even looking in our direction. Our food was brought by the kid at the counter. No refills. No 'how's the food?' (Which was wrong and blan). Overall, it was just an awful experience as a whole. A lady finally came up to us after we were done eating and apologized. She said she is hardly ever there (assuming she was an owner) and that they had two call offs and only had two waitresses all day. Understandable if they were slammed... but we were literally only one of two tables occupied, and when we walked in, the other table was already finished eating. TWO waitresses cant handle one table?!? Just awful. They all just sat at the bar and laughed loudly. Could have still been salvaged a little if the food was decent... but no such luck. Excited for the days this place is back up for lease. As my wife said when we were leaving, 'this place was better when it was just an empty building'."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing the nearby Cozumel was busy. Now I know why. The quality of food here is just decent...nothing special. Definitely not worth waiting an hour and a half for, and pay a hundred dollars too. Servers looked lost, even though they had nothing to do but wait as the kitchen struggled to serve orders on a mildly busy Saturday. If this place wants to succeed, they need to seriously consider putting less resources into waiters, and more into competent cooks."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to El Tequila. First time was decent - friendly service, everyone liked their food, etc. this visit was quite different. I ordered a combo with a chicken enchilada, chile relleno and added a chalupa. When the food came out, my chalupa looked like a tostada. So I asked about it. Our server (who did her best to be accommodating, btw), asked the kitchen. A manager-type came over and snarkily told me that their chalupas aren't like Taco Bell, and that's how they make them. Turns out, a chalupa doesn't always come rolled (though that's how I've always had them - even at other authentic Mexican restaurants). However, they are made with a fried *flour* tortilla. This one was corn, making it a tostada. Next, I tried my chile relleno. Which was missing the chile. The. Chile. It was a soft corn tortilla wrapped around cheese. When I asked about it, I was again told \"that's how we make them\". So here, a chile relleno is a cheese enchilada.  Consider yourself warned. Would like to say we'd give it another chance, but there's other good Mexican options in town."}
{"text":"The servers were attentive and quick. I ordered a California Burrito which had beef and shrimp and it was really good. The shrimp was cook perfect. It's one of the better Tex-Mex places in Parma."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to El Tequila during their \"Grand Opening\" week on Tuesday 2/20  We were greeted promptly when we came in by a friendly server and seated in a booth, as requested. She took our drink orders and left to retrieve them. Another man came by promptly to deliver chips and salsa - so far, so good.  The server came back with our drinks and took our orders. It was then that the trouble began...   When we arrived there were a few other tables of diners in the restaurant. However, as soon as our drinks were on the table, people started flicking in to the restaurant! A dinner rush! During the Grand Opening! What a surprise!!   Our server came to our table to check our chips and drinks and felt the need to let us know that they were quite slow earlier so they had sent employees home. She was rather distressed.   We sat there waiting for our meals... We started looking around to see if other people were getting their food. We saw a couple that had been there long before us, just getting their meals... Our server took another table just behind us. She proceeded to complain to them that they were so slow earlier that they had sent employees home, but then they had an unexpected dinner rush... ... ... What???????? During your grand opening, don't you want to have a big dinner rush??????? Also, it's incredibly unbecoming for a server to complain to guests about how short staffed that you are. It does not make a diner want to tip higher.  The food finally came after an hour and a half wait. It was good - but not great.   We waited another half hour for our check. Our server had completely disappeared. Another server had to procure our check and ring us out.  And I didn't even mention the atmosphere... The place is dark with an incredibly high ceiling so any sound seems to carry. The table didn't feel clean and the menus were definitely sticky. It has an almost school cafeteria feeling..   TL:DR Horrendous service  Bad atmosphere  Food ok  With Si Senor and Cozumel on either side of it, I don't see this restaurant being open long."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for the 1st time. When our server brought out our chips she asked if we wanted guacamole and queso on the side. I said yes not realizing that was an extra $8. I hadn't even seen the menu yet! The guacamole was terrible. It was simply a mashed avocado.  We ate none of it which our server didn't even notice because she didn't check on us. Our drinks weren't filled and I had to go ask for our ticket.   Both of our meals were wrong. I ordered the Burrito California which is supposed to come with a side of black or refried beans and I got neither. The server never asked and it  Wasn't and tell I looked at a menu later that I realized I should have gotten some. The burrito was just OK I liked the sauce and the shrimp but the steak was very tough and kind of crunchy.  My companion ordered Tacos De Pollo Asada which was supposed to come with shredded chicken but she ended up with cubed chicken.   Our server seemed nice enough but not attentive at all and clearly needs training.   Too many places to eat around here. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I felt as if I was in the twilight zone while dining here for dinner. The food was okay, and everything else was not okay. Our waiter told us we could have any margarita flavor we'd like, then 20 minutes later tells us only lime is available......asked for frozen, received on the rocks. At that point we didn't even say anything because we could see that this whole entire place has not the slightest clue as to what they're doing. Amongst many other things, our waiter was not too bright and needs to be trained much better. This whole experience reminded me as if I was attending a circus show, or waiting to be \"punk'D\". Will most certainly stick to si senor and Cozumel. Last but not least, maybe someone could explain to the waitress that keeping cigarettes behind your ears while carrying food around isn't too appealing. Barf."}
{"text":"The queso dip is awful and plain the rice isn't anything special the food is subpar to say the least the pico still has the jalape√±o seeds in it... the \"house margs\" are BAD super sour and not even the right color... service is slow... food came out in legit 2 mins but it wasn't hot it was warm but not hot...   Take the extra 2 mins drive up the road and go to si senor it is MUCH better this place will close in less than a year"}
{"text":"Attentive service, excellent street style tacos, ridiculously hot yellow (habanero) and orange (roasted pepper with seeds) salsas if you ask for them. I had grilled pollo tacos (which I didn't see on the menu - I asked for chicken and they asked what type) on soft corn tortillas with onion and cilantro. My wife had the same thing except black beans for the protein. The tacos were over stuffed, and the kitchen sent us some queso spinach dip on the House. They have like 10 draft beers, the usual Mexican and domestic options but still a lot of options.  I'll be back, and next time I'll only order 2 tacos since they were huge. There are a number of negative reviews on here I attribute to opening pains, I'd suggest people try again."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning, would not recommend, unfortunately I need a to choose a star to continue"}
{"text":"Margaritas are delicious! wait staff was friendly. I got the shrimp fajita quesadilla which were delicious."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this restaurant a poor review because they are new and trying to establish rapport within the community. But I'm pretty sure that my mom and I got food poisoning from eating there last night. The food was pretty poor, I ordered a taco salad and they doused it in queso dip which made everything soggy. Everyone in our party of eight or so thought that the chips were cooked an old/bad oil because there was a sour aftertaste.  The restaurant was not particularly clean on the inside, although that restaurant space has been vacant for a while but the floor needs replaced and the whole place could use a good cleaning from floor to ceiling.  When we pulled up, there was a server and kitchen staff fighting outside near the dumpsters (play fighting, we think throwing food at each other) but was not the best for first impressions. I will not go here again, mostly because the food was poor and the place kind of grossed me out.  Not to mention that 2 people got sick overnight after eating there.  Server was nice though and staff was attentive.  Edit: my dad got sick too... so that's 3 of 6 adults.  Thank God my kids are OK."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about stepping into this place because of all the bad reviews, but I'm glad I didn't let them stop me. I came in today for lunch and there was only one other person there when I walked in. I was greeted right away by very friendly waitress and seated. The chips and salsa were very good! The restaurant itself is very nicely appointed, I like the decor. I ordered the huevos ala Mexicana and a cheese quesadilla. Very good!! I recommend a bit of salsa on the eggs. The refried beans and the quesadilla were very nice. The rice wasn't that great but it wasn't awful. The waitress was attentive and refills were given in a timely manner. Without getting into too many details, I had a panic attack when I realized I had lost something important, the waitress was so kind and so caring throughout it. She got a very big tip from me for being so kind. All in all it's a very good place I only have one complaint in that was the table was a bit wobbly but really that's it. I definitely recommend trying it. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Agree with Barb B. A new restaurant with dirty menus and sticky tables. Dined in on a week night and was not busy at all. Maybe 4 other tables and also a very large children's party (which was very loud and unruly but no fault to the restaurant). Our server was forgetful and seemed very unskilled at customer service. We waited for the wrong drinks. Many margarita options but were told they were out of every flavor except lemon. Lol. Food was good but again service sucked and very chaotic environment. Children and staff running all around on a night that wasn't busy. Please save yourself the trip and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant that's new to the area in an easy to find location. The restaurant is large and great for groups. It's clean and well maintained. The staff were friendly and very attentive. They provided beverage refills 3 times and offered to refill our chips. We took advantage of the daily special and had their delicious pitcher of House Margaritas. They were well mixed and the pitcher was generous. We had the pollo loco and it was ABSOLUTELY perfect. The quesadilla relleno was also tasty. We even had the chance to talk with the management. He was very friendly and personable. He wanted to ensure that our visit was perfect. The service was quick. Highly recommend this restaurant. It's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"As  native Southern Californians my husband and I  are VERY picky about our Mexican cuisine. We moved here in Dec. after spending four dismal Mexican food years in St. Louis. Hooray! I can't believe we found an excellent Mexican restaurant so soon! We ordered the fajitas and margarita special. We got the fajita special: shrimp, beef AND chicken for two (when does THAT ever happen) and two huge margaritas for 20 something dollars! Woo hoo! Great SoCal Mexican food for Cleveland prices! The shrimp was especially amazing. The beans were NOT the usual bland midwest style beans but authentic and tasty. For our next visit I ordered the all you can eat tacos for taco Tues. for only 6 bucks. The chicken was especially amazing. I can't believe our hunt for great authentic Mexican is over so soon. It took three years for us to find just \"decent\" Mexican in St Louis and then they tore the place down and built a Texas Roadhouse...sigh. El Taquila is our new \"go to\". The service was wonderful and everyone was so friendly! Just ignore the previous reviews. It takes restaurants a little time to find their stride...and they have! Please go for our sake. We NEED this place to stay in business!"}
{"text":"So I write this as the experience happens.  Now I realize it's Cinco de Mayo however this place is not overly busy.  I arrived and was seated at the bar.  I'm the only one at the bar.  I sit there 10 minutes without a thing so I go back and get seated at a table.  The waiter came quick.  I ordered a meal, water and a margarita.  I get stale chips quick.  Salsa is not bad.  20 minutes later I stop the waiter again for the water and margarita.  People around me keep sending drinks back.  The water is cold at least.  The margarita is average.  Still waiting on food. At 37 minutes I've been offered food that was not for me.  Should have taken it.  I might never get food.  I failed to mention I still haven't gotten silverware or a napkin.  After 45 minutes my sizzling chimichanga arrived cold and a mess.  Waiter claims it had been in a to go box but they took it out.  I waited 5 minutes for the manager who never came and finally the waiter told I could just leave.  I made sure he wasn't getting charged as the kitchen issue is not his.  He assured it was fine.  I would suggest stay away at all costs.  This place is a mess."}
{"text":"Finally tried El Taquila here on Broadview. It's located in Marc's strip mall so wasn't sure about it. Beautiful very Mexican decor. Adorable waitresses. Speedy service.  Very clean. Delicious home made salsa and fresh tri color corn chips. Corizo quesso was super tasty and not spicy. I ordered Carne Asada and the meat was tender and flavorful on what seemed like homemade corn tortillas, with diced onion and fresh diced cilantro and fresh lime.. My daughter ordered Taste of Mexico with a variety of tacos and quesadillas. She took half home. My son ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was nice sized and delicious. Sides of rice and beans were tasty also. We each had an Amber Dos Equis with a slice of lime. Very nicely priced and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"4 of us went for lunch and 3 of the 4 got sick for 2 days  chips tasted weird also I called to tell someone at restaurant but they told me to call back at 240 manager would be in by then .... no thanks  looks like we were not the only ones in the same week that got sick"}
{"text":"Just left and have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  A gem in the neighborhood!  Strongly recommend the Taco Diablo!"}
{"text":"We had seen this place advertised and decided to give it a try. The service was extremely slow and the food was less than average, especially if you enjoy authentic Mexican cuisine. Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Incredibly understaffed for a Saturday night. Took over 30 minutes to even take our drink order. The table we were seated at was so unstable that we had to keep our foot on it or risk our drinks spilling. Food was average. I was really hoping for a good restaurant for Broadview Heights in this space. Unfortunately, this is not it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week. The second time was to re-try after a bad first impression, and my sister (who had been here before and enjoyed it) said I had to give it another go.  While the food is delicious and the restaurant is appealing, the service and staffing here leaves much to be desired. The wait staff are children. What I mean is, when you order a margarita from your 17-year-old waiter, he has to tell the ONE waitress over 21, who has to fit in bartending duties along with her own tables. So be prepared to wait for alcohol, as she's the only who can legally touch it. She's nice as pie as though. I tipped her well. You can tell she's trying very hard.  This place has potential but is grossly understaffed with young and under-trained kids. I have no problem hiring young staff, they need the opportunity but there has to be a grown adult, full time bartender, especially when margaritas are on special, and it's Friday! You can't drag another waiter away from her tables."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star only because Yelp requires it.  Realizing that all new establishments need time to work out issues, I'm not sure this place has enough time.  Our server was unbelievably horrible.  Didn't remember anything, had to keep asking for the same things.  I wasn't sure we would get the right food.  The food was average at best.  We were brought the wrong check four times.  Margaritas we're just okay.   Place seemed dirty to me for being so new.  Table and menu we're stick and windows dirty.  Not a good sign.  There are so many other Mexican restaurants in the area that I'm not so sure this place will survive."}
