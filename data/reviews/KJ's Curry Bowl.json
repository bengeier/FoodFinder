{"text":"Superb food, personal service, simply my favorite dinning experience.  This is why I still go out to eat.  My business is always appreciated and I leave with a dazzled pallet and a smile every time.  Customer for life!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I am not someone who write a lot of reviews. In fact, as a yelp user for several years, this is my second ever yelp review. My husband and I visited here for the first time 5 months ago and have been back 10+ times since. It is our new favorite restaurant for take-out. They have a great menu with so many delicious options and all the employees we have talked to are friendly. I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of the waitress, My wife and I and ordered the chicken and vegetable curry and shared.  The curry was fairly good, but salty.  I ordered the avocado shake and I thought it was very good, but the wife did not.  Service was very good. We felt bad for the waitress because the restaurant has potential."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Everything is fresh and they will customize any dish. Service was great and very friendly. I had the chicken masala with medium spice and it was perfect - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for takeout.  Food was very delicious and flavorful.  We ordered 2 to go entrees (weekend special-coconut roti with chicken curry and chicken and potato curry) and instead of getting two separate containers of rice we only got one which did not contain enough rice.  That is my only complaint.

Will def go back, prices were a bit high but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Very good food and super friendly service!  I had never had Sri Lankan food before so I was apprehensive the first time we went in.  The owners wife waited on us and was super nice in explaining the dishes.  We then went back at another time and tried the buffet.  The buffet food was good and fresh- and it was really nice getting to try a variety of new dishes!"}
{"text":"KJS is not going to be your typical Indian food restaurant. This is genuine Sri Lankan food. The tastes are much deeper, flavors are quite a bit more difined and the use of actually curry leaf is there.

This is a special treat found ony on the coasts of this country. I know most have not tried Sri Lankan curry, but this is the real deal. If it is your first time to have curry, particularly, Sri Lankan curry, you really should try going during the buffet on Friday and Saturday at lunch time.

As for the portion sizes mentioned in other reviews....huh? This is typical size portions for Indian/Sri Lankan food. The 3 of us went, got three orders, overate, took home lefovers."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place after seeing so many good reviews on Yelp. First, the service was bad - waitress didn't give us any water and we had to ask for it, plus when it did come we were lacking one. When I asked for the missing cup of water the waitress looked surprised and didn't even apologize. The service just got worse throughout the meal. 

Next, the food was terrible. I got the dhal curry which had zero dhal and a few tiny pieces of onion and carrots. It was mostly just diluted sauce served with plain white jasmine rice - not the usual long-grain basmati rice. It was so bad I couldn't finish the dish even though I was starving afterwards since I basically just had curry sauce and white rice. 

My SO had the same complaint - very little chicken in his tikka masala curry. This place is overall cheap, tries to cut corners, and offers bad service. There are many other better restaurants in the area, so avoid this if you can!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant on Saturday, early evening - arrived around 5 pm.

Two items we requested were unavailable (pork satay and coconut pudding).

We settled on the beef satay, and we both agreed it was very disappointing.  The meat held very little flavor and was tough.  I'm guessing some marinade would have helped both these problems immensely  The peanut sauce was also fairly flavorless.  It was supposed to come with rice or salad, but arrived without either.  When we asked about it, the server was confused.  He eventually arrived back at our table with rice, saying we were right - that it came with rice (though he didn't ask our preference, and we would have requested salad).

We ordered the chicken and potato curry bowl, which was okay, but nothing to write home about.

The mango lassi was great.  The dining area is pleasant.

Service was a bit slow and the food and drink were slow to arrive, despite the restaurant having only a couple tables of guests.  Our server was friendly and animated, always with a smile on his face.

This is a new restaurant that has a few kinks to work out.  I love to support local restaurants and was very excited about the possibilities at Kj's Curry Bowl.  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver :("}
{"text":"Amazing food, I ordered a fried rice with chicken and shrimp  and it was delicious. The attention is really good."}
{"text":"really nice place!! good food, clean place, friendly environment, good price!! still can be better with good exhaust system!! will go back there again and suggest everybody should try"}
{"text":"I thought the food was very hot (spicy) and had trouble eating some of the dishes.  My friend, who has a high tolerance for hot food, enjoyed it and ate most of it.  If you like hot and exotic food (served on a banana leaf!), you will probably like this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison, and given the quality of the competition, that is a high honor.

At first I was skeptical, since the menu is a strange amalgam of their specialty -- Sri Lankan curries -- along with teriyaki bowls, fajitas, gumbos, and stir fry. Such an odd mixture lends to skepticism about the quality of the food, but that's not justified here. Actually, the presence of the other items on the menu is a great strength, because it means you can take your non-curry-loving friends and they'll still find something to eat.

The curries are the star attraction. The Sri Lankan flavors are very different than what you'd get at an Indian restaurant (and, from what I'm told by someone who would know, authentically Sri Lankan). My first time there, it took me a little while to get used to it (there's a certain complexity to the flavor that requires some acclimation), but I was soon hooked.

They will adjust the spiciness to order. If you ask for spicy, you will get it; I'm a confirmed spice-lover that orders food spicy almost everywhere else, but I often go for medium here. However, I can confirm that if you ask for your curry mild, it will indeed be as requested, and it will still be very good.

Family-run place with friendly, thoughtul service.

I've always thought this place would do fabulously well downtown; the quality of the curries, and the rarity of Sri Lankan restaurants, would attract a lot of people, while the rest of the menu might appeal to the late-night college crowd. Being on the far west side, the restaurant is too far to attract these people (and living downtown myself, I don't get here as often as I'd like), but it does mean that this is generally a nice, quiet place to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Great food and service.

Spice levels higher than usual. .just ask for one level lesser than your usual."}
{"text":"Great options.  Teriyaki chicken is great and they have a good spicy sauce.  Recently tried chicken and potato curry spicy level and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Been several times ALWAYS amazing! The coconut roti special was fantastic. It was my wife's first time there, she had potato chicken curry and thought it was the best curry she's had, \"the depth and balance was exceptional.\""}
{"text":"I came here on a whim on a day off from work. I was bummed that their buffet isn't open for lunch everyday, but I understand it might not be lucrative or could waste a lot of food. 
I wanted one of everything on the menu, so I asked my server for her recommendation, and I took her advice. I got the chicken and potato curry and it was DELISH! I loved every bite of it. It was brought out steaming hot with rice, and the portions were perfect for lunch. I'm a bit of wimp with spice, but I like a little kick, and they got it just right for me. 
The server was great, and we even had a nice talk about immigration and Women's rights - totally random and innocent, but friendly. 
I can't wait to go back for the buffet so I can try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Took Jed to Sri Lankan dinner at KJ's Curry Bowl. Thanks to Maria and Rohan for the recommendation -- it was delicious, and I am STUFFED. The tea was perfect, like my mother makes. The vegetarian idiyappam kottu was delicious, and Jed adored it, which makes it extra sad that he can only get it once a year, when he comes to Madison with me for an annual conference.

Both chicken curry and brinjal moju were spot on! If you're in the area, highly recommended. And I got a Sri Lankan fruit salad with ice cream dessert that makes me think of the last time I had something like it, at the Pinnawala elephant orphanage, watching the elephants play in the river...homesick now.  Sigh.

May I say once again that it is appalling that Chicago (where I live) doesn't have a Sri Lankan restaurant? It is appalling. And unfair. I want idiyappam for breakfast and kottu roti for lunch and I want egg hoppers for special occasions and I want to not have to cook it myself and that doesn't seem too much to ask, does it?

(They actually offer a wide array of non-Sri Lankan food as well, so if you're with a crowd, or kids, who might not be up for Sri Lankan (the fools!), you can still feed everyone.)"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant when the news talked about a kitchen fire that delayed the opening for several months. The two times I've been here for dinner, I've had great service and inexpensive, delicious stir-fry. They managed to keep the dishes flavorful without using to much oil. I look forward to eating here many more times."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go - pol roti with chicken curry. The roti was amazing, nice and hot - flavorful and authentic. Chicken curry- lip smacking goodness. Almost went back to bring 2 more of these ( downtown to Kjs was a trek!). The most amazing food ever, and will go back every weekend for their specials. The chicken curry reminded me of home made food, and well lets say the spiciness was explosive. I love that so it worked great, but can get the mild or medium too. One important thing to note is that in most place spicy food lacks flavor and just has the 'chili' factor, but here spicy food was also flavorful. 
The place looked great too, comfortable so next time I will sit there and eat - much better to eat hot food than cold :) Very friendly owner, a true gem in Madison."}
{"text":"We just got back from a trip to Sri Lanka and this place is the real deal. Order the authentic curry dishes: chicken, potato, dal and eggplant curries were all outstanding. They even had string hoppers and wattalappam!  Only thing I wish they had tonight was the all famous pol sambal but they said they make it on other nights!  Please try this place and make sure you say Ayubowan when you leave!"}
{"text":"Taste was good but really skimped on the ingredients. I could probably count the number of pieces of chicken in my stir fry on one hand. Not plentiful on the veggies either."}
{"text":"Ate here last week with a friend for the first time and had the chicken curry which was delicious!  They must have made some changes to the chicken after the last review, because it was really good.  Juicy and tender dark meat.  My friend had the tofu curry which was equally delicious.  The waitress was also really nice.  We were chatting and completely lost track of time.  We ended up staying about half hour past their closing time, and the waitress waited patiently for us and was really friendly even as we were leaving.  I didn't realize until I got into my car and saw the time.  Sorry!!  You could have said something, but I appreciate that you let us stay so late!"}
{"text":"Came to this new establishment with friends on a Saturday dinner. The restaurant looks clean and bright--but with very few patrons--only about 5 tables of people showed up during the entire dinner time. 

As many have noted, the menu is very eclectic, or in a big identity crisis. Burritos, cajun food, Chinese, and Sri Lankan cuisine on the same menu? I am not sure if I have seen such a menu anywhere else. 

Our conclusion is that the owner might have a very postmodern idea on what \"curry\" means. Any creamy and liquid dish could be conceptualized as a type of curry--therefore the Southwestern chili and Louisiana gumbo on the menu! It suddenly makes sense! 

We stick to the Srk Lankan dishes and ordered Pineapple Curry, Chicken and Potato Curry, Batu Moju (eggplants), and Kothu the weekly special item. 

The biggest problem for KJ is the small portion. I was stunned to see the tiny portion of eggplants and pineapple curry. 5 of us each got one spoon of the dish, and that was it! The two dishes were definitely overpriced. Chicken and potat curry was pretty good, but too spicy (we ordered medium) for our group. 

The sizes were also inconsistent. Kothu came with a decent amount and was the most memorable dish of the night. 

We also ordered paratha after being told they have no naan or roti. It was very disappointing. I can make better paratha with the frozen ones from Asian groceries. 

KY failed to impress our group with its current style. We still had a good time trying Sri Lankan food, but we also all agreed that KJ should be a three star restaurant. With the same amount of money, you can easily get much better (and more) food in other places.

 I could see that, with some soul-searching, KJ could be a new gem in West Madison, but I am afraid it has to do it soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I am picky about my curry, and my lunch eggplant curry with tofu would stand up to any curry in town. A large helping,  with plenty of veggies, and the server was great about recommending the correct level of spicyness. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"When they tell you it is Spicy, they mean it is Spicy. Good Food and decent prices Great Service, I drank a lot of Water, Spicy. Like the Variety."}
{"text":"Still dreaming of their string hopper kottu and chicken curry ,
Very friendly staff and delicious food. I just wish it was closer to Milwaukee so i can eat here more often"}
{"text":"I haven't had an interest in buffets since I was a kid. Back then I found it novel to be able to try as many things as you want and stuff yourself with food until you're sick. I'm not a kid anymore though, so maybe buying into the buffet was my main problem here.

Either way, I don't feel like this place would be worth it. I spent the 12 bucks on the buffet lunch because everything else on the menu was just as expensive, so I figured that being able to choose a bunch of different things would make it worthwhile. My girlfriend does not like curry, so she got a made-to-order dish for about what I ended up paying.

I picked out a few curries with some rice for my first trip. I took one bite and it was ice-cold. I mean, usually when people say ice-cold they're exaggerating, and their food is actually just luke-warm, but mine tasted like it had been sitting out for many many hours, and was truly very cold. I stopped the waitress as she dropped off my girlfriend's plate and asked her to reheat it in the back, and let her know the buffet was cold. She was apologetic and checked on the buffet table, came back and said something about it being hot on the bottom but all the cold stuff was on top. I think she turned up the heat but I can't be sure. 

Regardless, she was nice enough to throw my plate of curry in the microwave for a few seconds and brought it back hot. Maybe it was the microwave or maybe it just wasn't good food, but I was nonplussed with what I was eating. I took my time eating to allow the other food to heat up more, and then tried for a second plate. It too was just as cold, and this was after following the waitresses second set of instructions (something about stirring it up beforehand).

I left most of the food on my plate and finished my mango lassi (which was ironically one of the better ones I've had). Tried a bit of my girlfriend's Szechuan beef and it was at least hot, but was meager in portion-size and really wasn't anything special. We paid our 30-something dollar tab and left.

I don't recommend this place, and I don't plan to ever be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very kind people! It's in a quiet area that makes me think you might pass it by - don't! Go in and have delicious food!"}
{"text":"We took a trip to Sri Lanka about a year ago and loved the food!! We were so excited to find this place, when we walked in it instantly brought back great memories from our trip - and the food was spot on! Get the buffet! There are a lot of options, and it really is exactly like the food we had in Sri Lanka!"}
{"text":"A very authentic Sri Lankan restaurant, place is clean and tidy, food is so good.
The restaurant did well in asian-type cooking, Sri Lankan, Indian, Japanese and few Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"An Absolute treat! 
This is a treasure-trove of hearty, heartwarming Indian-fusion delights!
The menu is vast, with all of your favorites and plenty of surprises to keep you coming back, trying new things. The bold, rich layers of flavor KJ's was able to create in my dish was several steps above my expectations. Their wonderful spin on curry dishes is an incredible balance of seasoning and spice. Additional options, like brown rice was a nice treat as well.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not sure about all the positive reviews. The staff was great. Very friendly, great people. But the food was quite average as was everything else. The atmosphere, etc. They did give us complimentary ice cream. But it wasn't very good either. Id say to try thai basal. Much better food. Would not make a trip here again. And not worth the price"}
{"text":"Done Right!  Wonderful service, we are always greeted with the kindest smiles and \"how are yous?\" because they actually remember us.  It feels like home.  My son and I have been going to this place for years.  It is \"our place\" because it is always fairly quiet and private so we can enjoy a meal out without a huge crowd or wait. We feel important too.  The sczechun beef and broccoli is my favorite (perfect spice) and my son says it's the BEST chicken teriyaki EVER but has finally branched out to chicken curry marsala.  I really hope all the best success for KJ and his wife. They are wonderful people."}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite restaurant in Wisconsin, which is saying quite a lot!

Specifically for the buffet, available Friday and Saturdays for lunch.

This past Saturday I really liked the jack fruit curry, asparagus-beet curry, eggplant dish, and spring rolls on the buffet.

There was an extensive selection of fun foods that were new to me.

I really like the husband and wife whom I presume own and run the restaurant. They seem to really care, and take the time to share their culture, and Sri Lankan cuisine with people interested in learning.

For example I asked \"what is that\", pointing to the yellow squares in the jack fruit curry. The woman told me about jack fruit and said it was pretty good. It was actually really good. Later the man told me about a well-known rock in Sri Lanka, when I asked about it in a poster near the cash register.

KJ's Curry Bowl is well worth discovering. It's something I think all adventuresome eaters in Dane County should experience.

I would go there probably every other weekend, if I lived on the West Side. It is that delicious, and welcoming!"}
{"text":"We visited KJ's Curry Bowl last Friday. The decor is nice, nothing too fancy, wait staff is extremely polite and attentive. We ordered Beef Satay with two side sauces, peanut and spicy Teriyaki. We tried both Chicken and Beef Satay, both of the appetizers were great! The appetizers came with broccoli and brown rice on the side. 

For the main entree's we had the chicken curry in a coconut sauce and a tofu curry with brown rice on the side. Our favorite was the chicken curry:) Tofu was good too but nothing outstanding. I personally used the saracha sauce on the side because I like it really hot!

The Chef was generous to provide complimentary mango ice-cream which was ok. 

I think the food is good but I was puzzled by the menu because it is a combination of several cuisines, e.g. American, Mexican, Thai and Sri Lankan. Not sure why the owner will create such and extensive menu with all the different cuisines, why not stick to the Sri Lankan cuisine only. I don't think I would like to go to a Sri Lankan restaurant to order Thai or Mexican in mind.

I think it might be important for the owners to think about creating the focus on Sri Lankan cuisine and how to differentiate themselves from other cuisines like Indian/Pakistani/Thai."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no complaints about this place. Truly a very good Sri Lankan restaurant with great food and ambiance. I drove all the way from Chicago to check it out and I must say that it was well worth it. We ordered the 'String Hopper Kottu' along with the pork satay for appetizers along with 'avocado juice'. I even tried a Mango juice later on which was spot on. The whole meal was served quickly and was very tasty! I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This is easily a four star spot once you recognize the curry is what you should go there for, everything else is just..... Well I don't know what the hell the rest of the menu is needed for to be honest.  I was on that side of town and decided to pick up dinner from KJ's and take it home with me.  I ordered two chicken and potato curries and one green bean curry. The hostess and I just naturally hit it off and had a pleasant conversation while I waited. I may have been the only other person in the place. We started talking about spice and I told her I adore spicy curry and we both gave each other this look, the \"are you serious when you speak about spice or are you faux-spice where even mild salsa sets your buds on fire?\" And the \"yes I like spicy like 12 chili spicy and yes I have rubbed my eyes mistakenly while cutting chilis at home trust me I know what I'm getting into and I want you to take me there\" wink that must have convinced her because she told my order to the cook in a language I am unfamiliar with and as soon as the sizzle hit the pan I could smell the spice in my nostrils and it gave the familiar zing of spicy ass food wafting in the air. Oh yes, they took me seriously....

And it was excellent. You take this food home and you pour the sauce sparingly so not doused on the rice (all of you complaining about saltiness doused it, I bet),  and you break some of the potato up, grab some of the chicken pieces, and use the sauce to congeal it with the rice into a nice little ball in your fingers and you push that into your mouth and proceed to moan with the goodness.  I mixed mine with the green bean curry because I crave veggie like no other. These dishes mix perfectly, you should try it. 

Spice level? The spice level was explosive, it was excellent, it had me pouring a tall glass of milk and taking turns with food and drink to keep the balance. Some people like to just sweat it out and have towels handy nearby.  

There was plenty for left overs. The next day for lunch I heated up some Kawan brand Paratha on the stovetop until crispy and flaky and perfect for tearing apart and dipping in the heavenly curry sauce that The Curry Bowl provided. We literally had not a drop left after sopping up the leftovers with our paratha.  

Definite go-to."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their curries are all on point, especially the chicken and potato! I usually get one to eat there and one to go for lunch/breakfast the next morning because I love the chx/pot so much. I hover around the mid level spice because it's recommended but I will try out the spicy version this week just to give it a go! Other great menu items are their chipotle chicken and spicy teriyaki quesadillas. Their teriyaki is good but a little on the salty side so keep that in mind when ordering! Expert tip: the Oreo Rice Krispy treats are amazing."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I got the tofu curry, which had the perfect amount of spice. There were very little people there, and the food came quickly."}
{"text":"Oh, KJs... you have gotten good reviews in general, so we gave you a try--twice. We really, really want to like you.

First off, let me say that the owner?/server/woman who greets you when you walk in is very pleasant and friendly, so major points for that. :)

Otherwise, meh. KJs tries to be a lot of things to many people, with dishes ranging from teriyaki/stir fry to quesadillas to burritos to cajun food to curry. As a result, nothing excels. In our first visit, my partner had a teriyaki meal that did not reach beyond the level of frozen-dinner-heated-up, and which was so doused in teriyaki sauce that it was totally unappealing. We also ordered potstickers that were good, I suppose, but were overpriced for how few you get (4, if I recall correctly). On our second visit, he ordered a chicken masala that lacked the cream and complexity I have always found in that dish--the sauce was thin (liquid rather than \"gravy\") and the spices seemed one-dimensional and over... cinnamoned, perhaps? In both cases, my partner--a big believer in \"quantity over quality\" most of the time--didn't finish his food.

For my part, I ordered two slightly different, vegetarian curries in my two visits. They were ok, but also not as complex and flavorful as I would have liked, and they had very few vegetables in them (the potato curry pretty much was just potato). Additionally, neither of them came with any kind of protein (I wanted tofu); adding it was an additional $3, which brought the price up to closer to $13 or $14--pretty pricey for a semi-fast-food-style place.

Finally, the booth where we sat for our second visit had a chunk of base board missing, so there was a big hole in the wall and lots of visible drywall otherwise--a state that always leaves that question of \"what's back there?\" lingering in one's mind."}
{"text":"Do you want good food? Of course you do and KJ Curry delivers. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was open and welcoming. And then the food. It was all delicious and offered many vegetarian options. KJ's Curry is definitely going on the list of restaurants we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the generic name. This is a genuine Sri Lankan restaurant.

I once took a date to a Sri Lankan place in NYC. When asked how spicy she wanted her dish, she said 'hot'. The waitress gave her The Look, and suggested something milder. After a ten minute argument, my date relented and agreed to 'medium'. After taking one bite, tears started streaming down her face, and they didn't stop until after the meal was over. It was the spiciest food I've ever had. This place is definitely a lot more Americanized, but you can get spicy food if you really demand it (don't just settle for 'hot' when they ask you how spicy you want your food).

Unfortunately, Sri Lankan classics like lamprais, aappa, vade, etc. aren't available, but their curry is solid."}
{"text":"Super delicious! My vegan friend ordered one of the eggplant dishes (I can't remember which) and it was slightly sweet (a natural sweet from the veggies) and delicious. We went here on a whim, so I didn't realize it was Sri Lankan until the waiter suggested I change my order from the Chicken Masala (always an easy go-to for Indian food) to the Chicken and Potato Curry. He was right and I was very glad I did! It had tons of flavor and a lot of depth and was definitely a Sri Lankan curry as opposed to Indian. Portions were large, but we both finished our plates... leftovers for people at home/lunch tomorrow be damned! Sadly this left no room for dessert, so no comment there.

As for spiciness level... We both ordered mild to be safe and there was no heat at all in either dish. The waiter recommended I try Mild+ next time since I was looking for more heat. So that sounds like heat level is super customizable depending on your palate, which is always great. 

My friend and I stayed a long time after we finished eating and they were very nice about leaving us alone but refilling our waters.

Great place - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I go by KJ's Curry Bowl I'm reminded of the episode of \"Seinfeld\" where Jerry hopes for the restaurant across the street to succeed, though it's in a location with a history of restaurant failures. The variety of cuisines, menu changes, pleasing host/chef, it's all too familiar!

Through my two years I've only had KJ's Teriyaki Tuesday take out (steak and chicken) and a pleasant surprise of Taste of Madison something Sri Lankan, a layered veggie thing. That at the last day of Taste they recognized me (after a half dozen restaurant stops, so I wouldn't say I'm that much of a regular) speaks to the service level. This husband and wife duo do it all and the food tastes good. They aim to please and that is to be commended. 

Ample parking, convenient location five minutes off the beltline for those traveling from anywhere but the west side, quiet atmosphere, would be great for booking off site lunches for work and groups!

My only negatives resulting in one star off is for a bit small portion sizes for the price."}
{"text":"Finally a subcontinental joint with some spice. They also have the distinction of being a bit different than every other Indian place in Madison. You can still get your chicken tikka, but they have other options for the more adventurous. The eggplant curry is my favorite

The menu is a bit strange and I couldn't tell you about the Chinese or other food they make. I mean if the owners are from Sri Lanka you should probably get Sri Lankan food

Oh and when they say spicy, they mean it. The chef came by and laughed at me for having a runny nose. Joke's on him though because I was enjoying every minute of it"}
{"text":"To keep it concise: amazing food (try the batu curry!), friendly staff, pleasant pan flute covers on the speakers, efficient + quick seating/ordering, an extensive menu.

Every time I bring someone new to KJ's, they tell me they wish they'd known about it sooner. It's just an overall pleasant experience, and there are always leftovers!"}
{"text":"Tried out the buffet at this place after hearing people having enjoyed dinner here.

One first look this place looks like any other Indian buffet but on closer inspection they serve dishes I had never tried before so it was a nice change of pace. 

Some unfamiliar options offered were asparagus curry, plaintain curry, milk rice (like regular rice just a little bit creamier- tasty!), carrot salad, fish and potato fried balls, pork curry, and pistachio pudding. The pistachio pudding tasted kind of like whipped cream, which made me wonder if it was whipped cream and how many calories I was ingesting.

The buffet was good but I don't know that I would crave it. I think I would like to try their dinner at some point since there are some dishes on there that seemed more interesting than the buffet options."}
{"text":"Flavorful, authentic pan-Asian food with an emphasis on Sri Lankan. Extremely tasty, perfectly spiced and a choice between white rice and much healthier and tasty brown rice. If your dining companion is not as adventurous as you, there is also Cajun and Mexican food to choose from. Very reasonable prices, quick service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After reading the Isthmus review for their Sri Lankan curries, I made the trek out to the west side with some friends. The curries are indeed on the last page of their menu, hidden away a little bit. The rest of the menu is an odd mixture of \"Southwestern\" offerings (burritos, quesadillas, etc), Cajun food (gumbo, pulled pork), and pan-Asian food (stir-fry, teriyaki). I can't vouch for any of those other cuisines, since we all got curries, but let me tell you, the curry is where it's at. 

We all asked for our curries hot, and that was a pretty manageable level of spiciness (maybe not if you are a native Midwesterner). Among the four of us, we had the dhal curry, mixed vegetable curry (one of that night's specials), and the eggplant dish (do not remember what it was called, one was a curry and one was fried eggplants). The eggplant dish was a bit on the salty side, but the dhal (lentil) curry was really tasty. You can get brown or white rice on the side. One of the things I found odd about KJ's was the pricing for their curries. The chicken and potato curry was $14, and the potato curry was about $12. A little pricey, compared to the green bean curry ($8) and dhal curry ($7). 

Aside from that, the curries are definitely worth checking out, and they have a different special every weekend. Go get you some spice."}
{"text":"Probably closer to a three-point-something star place but I'm rounding up because as other reviews have noted, the people there are all so nice.

Have been here for dinner or lunch several times, and just tried out the new lunch buffet.  As others have noted-- the regular menu is all over the map, which is frightening, but I've just stuck with the Sri Lankan curries which are good (but a bit on the salty side).  They also have quesadillas, so it checks the box for being a place that my pickier kid will eat at without too much protest.

The lunch buffet however was a surprise!  While I am not an expert on Sri Lankan food, there was a great variety (more than is on the regular menu) and it was actually appropriately SPICEY, unlike your typical Indian buffet.  They also had a couple of desserts-- again, different from Indian, but similar in that the overwhelming characteristic was sweet (which I actually like).  Our server said that they switch the dishes Fri/Sat/Sun from the rest of the week.  Lunch Buffet was a bargain @ $9.99, and I think weekends are $12.99.

I hope they continue to make it at this location-- it's been a location of doom for several restaurants, with the one before them being especially good..."}
{"text":"Well, I had high hopes for this restaurant.  I wanted to love it. I really did. Its right down the street from my pad.  But, unfortunately, the restaurant is suffering from an identity crisis.  I guess I was suprised to find that KJ\"s curry bowl had a variety of foods that did not scream \"curry\".   I came at 3 pm, so I'm not sure if I got a lunch menu or a dinner menu. The curry was on the back page which is surprising.  Then, there was an array of other ethnic cuisines---too many to be cohesive.   There is gumbo, burritos, quesadillas, chicken curries, stirfries, teriyaki bowls, etc.   Needless to say it was a real variety.  

 We started with a chicken satay with peanut sauce.  Then, my mom ordered a cheese quesadilla and I ordered chicken curry (medium).    

The satay:
  pros--- had a great thai peanut sauce (although i would like a bit more sweetness to balance out the soy sauce flavor--maybe a tad bit of honey or brown sugar?)  
  cons---oh wow. the chicken was awful.  its thigh meat, that has a weird aftertaste. I would suggest a marinade for the meat if they are going to cook it like that---something odd that left a bad taste in my mouth kept me from eating more than one piece.  We left the other meat to rest and ate the salad (hungrily) with the sauce.

The quesadilla:  well how can you screw this up? they did a good job of making a yummy four cheese quesadilla and i appreciated the queso dipping sauce. 

The Chicken Curry: 
pros--- the sauce is fantastic! I wish KJ's would highlight these types of things instead of having such an immense menu.....in fact, i would suggest a satay with the sauce they used for the curry! Yumm.  The flavors of the curry really were something to be coming for.  Also loved that they gave a brown rice and white rice option. 
cons--unfortunately the chicken was the problem again. Still the odd thigh meat that doesnt taste quite right (although admittedly tasted better drowning in the gravy).  I would say that if they would use a better cut of meat and threw in some vegggies (maybe mushrooms? bellpeppers or cauliflower), it would taste more varied and look much more appetizing.   The $10 price tag on the chicken curry was WAY too much for the small portion I had. I would suggest a tag of $6.99 at most.  

For a treat, the chef sent us some yummy mango ice cream! that was nice!

I guess what I think is important and one of the most important things is that a restaurant needs to have a cohesive menu and have an identity.  KJ's leaves you wanting to know who they are appealing to.  I would suggest this restaurant do what they do best! SRILANKAN cuisine.  Not louisiana gumbo or burritos.  No where in Madison is there a place you can get AUTHENTIC sri lankan food. 

They would be better suited to have less to choose from on their menu, better quality ingredients, better prep (marinating chicken satay for example can help with thigh meat), get rid of four of the five cuisine types listed, and some little tweaks to make presentation more restaurant appealing.  

Five main dishes that are winners would be all that would keep me coming back. Trust in the quality of good meat and some good curry!

We would love to have another curry joint to go to and places like Sa bai thong can show you how good curry can appeal to many! don't need to sell out to too many people to get a following. The star was the gravy and that is the eastern vibe KJ's should continue with!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken Kothu roti at KJ's. It was absolutely excellent. If you are interested in eating something different in Madison, this is the place to be. I think it tops any Asian/Indian restaurant around. Sri Lankan cuisine is one with so much flavor and spices, it's a must try. If you can't handle spicy, they can make any dish mild as well. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the friendliness of the management and staff. It seems like a family run restaurant, which adds even more flavor and that home cooked touch. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for curry. In fact, I prefer their style of curry over Thai and Indian styles. I will say that, contrary to Thai curry which generally comes with abundances of veggies and meats, the focus here is definitely in the curry sauce. You will be disappointed if you are expecting a fully piled bowl, as expressed from another reviewer. But if you've visited similar Southern Asian countries, you would be accustomed to this. I quite enjoy pouring the sauce over the rice and eating the flavored rice because the sauce is the selling point. My favorites are eggplant curry and shrimp curry. 

Another thing to point out is they don't serve basmati rice. Why? Because this is not an Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant! This is a Sri Lankan restaurant. Therefore they serve Sri Lankan food. Would you expect basmati rice sushi rolls at a Japanese restaurant? No? Well the same concept applies here. 

Anyways, I encourage you to try this place with an open mind. I did and never looked back."}
{"text":"This is a unique and very delicious spot to try. I absolutely love that you get sticky rice with your order rather than the more common long grain rice. It seems to compliment the curry so much better and carries the sauce in a way that any other type of rice cannot hold up to. 

For my first go around at this spot I tried the eggplant curry. The emphasis here is definitely on the curry and less on the eggplant. Also, the eggplant was not cubed like I was expecting. Rather, the eggplant was cut closer to the skin and without much of the white vegetal matter at all. It was wok-fried and placed into a dish with the curry sauce. 

Definitely heed the warning that this place does deliver on spice levels - they are not catering to the Midwest version of \"spicy.\" Medium was all I could handle, tasty, but any more would have been WAY too much for an enjoyable lunch. 

I noticed a lot of people ordering the chicken curry so I may have to try that dish on the next pass. Also - they have a $2 off any Teriyaki dish on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Kj's has the best Sri Lankan food anywhere! 
There's a buffet or you can order from the menu.
We love the chicken satay with spicy peanut sauce for appetizers, and I always seem to get the chicken and potato curry and my boyfriend gets the beef teriyaki bowl.  Both never disappoint.  
The owners are so polite and welcoming you feel like you're in their home.
The first time we went I asked about some of the tapestries and art displayed and they put a beautiful documentary type of movie on the tv for us to get a better understanding of the celebration taking place in the art.. Wow! 
They were so nice and the food so amazing we will always come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Be sure to check in at the front desk. Neat space. You want hot curry--as in SPICY? You got it! Dumplings are amazing. Be sure to order as the appetizer. 

If you are expecting the curry with coconut to be somewhat sweet, this is not the case. However, it has a flavor that can be appreciated. I would order it again."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome chicken curry and really decent stir fry. Looking forward to returning on a Friday so I can try their buffet (they only do it Friday and Saturday at lunch).  We like pretty spicy food (love hot sauce), but rarely can tolerate really authentic \"hot\" Indian food, so we tried \"medium.\" It was a hair spicy for me to really enjoy it to full extent, but we did eat it all and our mouths weren't terribly on fire. Had to add lots of rice, though. We'd go \"mild plus\" next time (we should've listened to the nice server)."}
{"text":"I'm having a lot of trouble deciding how many stars to give this place.

We ordered delivery from Kj's last night because it was too cold to go out and the food sounded interesting. Based on other reviews, we decided to stick to the Sri Lankan food on the menu. We ordered the potato chicken curry, the chicken masala, and an order of the chicken satay appetizer (with choice of rice or salad, we chose salad). Our total (with delivery tip) was $35. That is a lot of money for 2 dishes and an appetizer!

The man told us the order would take 15-20 minutes to get to us from the time I called. An hour later, he showed up with our food. I have no problem with food taking an hour to prepare and deliver, but I do appreciate being told it will take that long.

The food is the reason I have so much trouble with the review. There was not much of it, and the curries were $11 and $13. The satay was $5 for 3 satay sticks, and it came atop a \"salad\" consisting of a tiny bit of cabbage and 4 pieces of broccoli. The food was tasty and well spiced but VERY salty. We had trouble eating it (even with copious amounts of rice to temper the salt) and decided to dilute the curries with water/coconut milk to help with the salt. I don't think I've ever eaten food so salty in my life. Even my boyfriend, who normally likes his food saltier than I do, thought it was way too salty to eat. Had the food been less salty it would have been delicious.

I think this place needs to reduce the prices of their food or increase portion sizes to make the cost worth it. If they did that and seriously cut back on the amount of salt they used, I would come back. At this point, unfortunately, I don't think I would recommend ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place is misfiled, thanks in no small part to the authenticity of the place.  This is an authentic Sri Lankan, Sinahlese restaurant, and the young couple owning-operating it have much to learn about American-Midwestern mainstream culture.  First, they obfuscate the fact that they are Sri Lankan, dishing up not just very authentic, but also very tasty Sri Lankan curry (my aunt Kamala makes authentic Sri Lankan curry, but it's not actually that good).  And yet, there is nothing on the menu, on the storefront, anywhere here that would tell a potential customer that this is a Sri Lankan place.  I've tried explaining to the owners that there is a subset of Americans who are looking for different, unique, exotic, foreign and authentic, there's a market for culinary adventure.  They think they need to hide their background, so they don't scare off potential customers.  Staggers the imagination, this is Madison Wisconsin. They play this canned smooth jazz that would be too cruel to use on prisoners of war, because it's called \"restaurant music.\"  Last time I was in there I brought in some traditional Sinhalese music for them to play, and a White family at a nearby table was enthusiastically encouraging them to play it, to no avail.  They have all this peculiar stuff on the menu, burritos, some pseudo Chinese stuff, because they want to entice the teenagers from the nearby school to come after classes.  Sweet Lord Shiva, they think American teenagers are a good thing to have in a restaurant.  Well forget all that, the sincerity of the owner-couple is part of the charm of this place.  They may not know a lot about American culture, but they sure have bought into the American dream.  Once you meet them, you'll want them to succeed too. 
     The weekday menu is limited, in terms of authentic Sri Lankan, but the green bean, chicken, and dal curries are delicious.  Unless you know what you're doing, do not ask for it Sri Lankan hot, but if you want authentic Sri Lankan hot, they will bring it on.  I am actually salivating as I type this.  This place is so good, not once, not twice, but three times, I've hopped on the bus to Madison during the week, from Milwaukee, just to eat lunch.  The prices are low, the food is unique, only order from the curry section, and order one more entree than you have people, bring some food containers (they will pack the leftovers in Styrofoam otherwise, environmentally unsound, and not smart as these are gravy dishes), and bring some food home.  That's what I do.  Weekends they add some special Sri Lankan dish that's not usually on the menu, look for lamprais (not an eel, it's a rice dish in a leaf), hoppers (it's not like anything you've eaten before, don't listen to anyone comparing them to crepes or pancakes), and get yourself on their email list.  This is the best Sri Lankan restaurant outside of New York City or Toronto in North America.  I know this for a fact, as I've been to them all.  
    Note: The interesting chairs are actually too low to be comfortable.  Go for the standard chairs or booths instead.  Also note, Sinhalese food should be eaten with the right hand.  It tastes better that way.  If encouraged, the owner-waitress can show you how.  
     Outside of a handful of Indian-Americans (they like this \"ethnic\" food which is similar to but not the same as what they get at home), some South Asian scholars, and a few of the overeducated suburban types within walking distance, this place is still largely undiscovered.  You totally get bragging rights if you come here with the sort of friends who will be impressed when you say, \"I found an authentic Sinhalese restaurant!\"  Greet them with a hearty \"Ayubowan,\"  when you come in, and tell them Rohan sent you.  Like most Sri Lankans, they know so many Rohans, they won't actually know who you're talking about, and they would give you the same wonderful service they give any customer, but I think you should tell them anyway."}
{"text":"I'm a Sri Lankan and I have been looking for a Sri Lankan restaurant in the neighborhood for a very long time. I'm so glad that I have KJ's Curry Bowl now to fulfill my appetite. 

KJ's is not just a Sri Lankan restaurant. They also serve some best handpicked Cajun, Asian and American dishes. The best thing about KJ's Curry Bowl is that they make everything from scratch!

I drove 70 miles to try them out and boy was I blown away! It was fully worth it."}
{"text":"Although the \"fusion\" concept is quite refreshing, KJ's failed to deliver on a Friday night. Mea culpa for ordering the Cajun Quesadilla at a Sri Lankan restaurant, but I thought exploring the \"fusion\" part of their menu. No matter what, a 'Quesadilla' should always come with cheese and sour cream. Mine came with almost no cheese and an overdose of Old Bay (to pass it off as Cajun), and a curious lump of rice (the 'fusion' part I guess). The chicken was stringy and dry, and almost seemed like ghosts of dishes past. However, they do get their Sri Lankan plates right. The chicken curry was fantastic but there was very little sauce served. When requested for some extra sauce, we were politely informed that it would not be possible since \"everything was made to order\". We ordered the speciality dessert (a cardamom-heavy flan-ish) which came out looking like a shapeless slime blob, with a nauseating amount of cardamom seeds (ground cardamon powder anyone?). For $4.95, you would expect better presentation and attention. 
We were informed that it was the server's first day at the job (rather curious as to how frequently I am served by first-day-at-the-job servers), but that was no excuse for her apathy. You know the service is bad when you are the only diners at the restaurant, and still have to walk to the Maitre D, requesting for the overpriced dessert, to-go boxes and the cheque. 
I would still be inclined to give them a second chance only because of the novel Sri Lankan menu items and only till I find my next Sri Lankan food fix."}
{"text":"This place is a total hidden gem.  You have to check it out now! I have to admit I was skeptical by the sheer weirdness of the combination of items on the menu. But we went here specifically to try the Sri Lanken dishes. And boy, they did not disappoint. We ordered the chicken and potato curry, the green bean curry, the Dal curry, and a sweet and spicy eggplant dish that was exquisite. All dishes were interesting with layered and complex flavors. I have to say that one week later I am still dreaming about this food. You should absolutely go, and check out this amazing place. We also devoured our leftovers. One word of warning, we ordered everything medium spicy, and it was almost too much for us, even though we can usually handle a lot of spice. Next time we are going to order a mixture of medium and mild spicy dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I thought it was great and really good. I love curry and the first time I was here, I had a teriyaki dish and the second time curry. I though they were both delicious, and we had the kabobs for appetizers. I believe the bill came to about $30-35? But definitely worth the price. I thoought the flavor of the food was great, the prices were also very reasonable and I had a very quick meal. I would always recommend this place and I'm surprised there are not more people who goes here to eat!"}
{"text":"Summary: food was good, staff exceeded all possible expectations, establishment was well-maintained.

We went to KJ's on a Friday night. We were greeted by a warm, courteous, attentive staff. We ordered the mixed vegetable curry (spicy), squash curry w/ chicken (mild), the mango lassi, and avocado drink. The drinks came first, and did not disappoint. Neither of us had ever had anything like the avocado drink, and it was a pleasant surprise, to say the least. The mango lassi was good, but doesn't match that of many local Indian restaurants. The curries were both very tasty. The spicy curry was surprisingly hot relative to similar restaurants in the area. The chef even personally greeted us during dinner to check on our dishes. He was eager to make sure that the spicy curry was to our tastes, offering to adjust the level of heat. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at KJ's, and we will definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Not really anything to like about this restaurant. Awkwardly large with a bizarre menu and poor food quality."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I agree with the other Yelp reviews, but I've only had one experience thus far and I ordered take-out. 

I got the Chicken Curry, ordered it in medium, proceeded to die of spiciness after eating a few bites. I can't even begin to imagine what hot or extra hot would have been like and I like spicy food. I decided on medium after reading the other reviews. So, there wasn't much chicken in it... Also, the chicken itself wasn't anything special.

The thing that threw me off was the sticky rice - is this Sri Lankan? I'm used to Basmati rice from similarly ethnic foods. I liked it at first, but wasn't sure how I felt about it a few bites later. Of course, this is just personal preference.

I also got the Watalapan dessert, which someone else had described to be like flan. I disagree. It's not quite like flan, unfortunately. It has too much cinnamon for my taste.

Maybe I'm just really uncultured and I have no idea what Sri Lankan food is all about - somebody teach me! I'm definitely open to trying this again, after I discover some more restaurants in my new home."}
{"text":"This family run place is a definite treat. KJ and his wife run this place. I visited during spring break and the kids were around discretely playing Carrom in the corner. 

Their spice levels are really spicy. The best way to figure out the right spice is to talk to the waiter. They will work out what the right spice level is based on your tastes. I normally take spicy but went a notch down to medium which I still found hot. The next visit I went mild plus. 

The lunch portions are much smaller than their dinner portions. The lunch portions make me feel I can top it off with a small snack and dinner portions make me feel like I over ate. This is my only grouse with the place.

Food is definitely closer to the south East Asian cuisine. Fair warning though - this is not an Indian place. Do not come in expecting basmati rice. 

My go to dish is their shrimp curry. I love the coconut base in the gravy. Post the meal, try a chai latte. It is a 50-50 mix of tea and milk that I always get to top of my meal. Even after a dinner at 8pm."}
{"text":"Great food - a hidden gem!

I'm surprised this place is not busier. We've eaten there on a few occasions and each time its been as great. We've sampled many of the items on the menu and they consistently make a good tasting meal.

Well worth the trip, parking is easy and the prices are right!"}
